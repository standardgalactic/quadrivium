About the Author
Tara Rodden Robinson, RN, BSN, PhD, is a native of Monroe, Louisiana, 
where she graduated from Ouachita Parish High School. She earned her 
degree in nursing at the University of Southern Mississippi and worked as 
a registered nurse for nearly six years (mostly in surgery) before running 
away from home to study birds in the Costa Rican rain forest. From the rain 
forests, Tara traveled to the cornfi elds of the Midwest to earn her PhD in 
biology at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. She conducted her 
dissertation work in the Republic of Panama, where she examined the social 
lives of song wrens. She received her postdoctoral training in genetics with 
Dr. Colin Hughes (then at the University of Miami) and through a postdoc-
toral fellowship at Auburn University. Dr. Robinson received a teaching 
award for her genetics course at Auburn and was twice included in Who’s 
Who Among America’s Teachers (2002 and 2005).
Currently, Tara teaches genetics via distance education on behalf of the biol-
ogy program at Oregon State University. On the research side, Dr. Robinson 
has conducted research on birds in locations all over the map, including 
Oregon, Michigan, Yap (part of the Federated States of Micronesia), and the 
Republic of Panama. Examples of her work include using paternity analysis to 
uncover the mysteries of birds’ social lives, examining the population genet-
ics of endangered salmon, and using DNA to fi nd out which species of salmon 
that seagoing birds like to eat.
When not traveling to exotic places with her husband, ornithologist W. 
Douglas Robinson, Tara enjoys hiking the Coast Range of Oregon with her 
two dogs in training for the Susan G. Komen 3-Day for the Cure. You can fi nd 
out more about her at www.thegeneticsprofessor.com.

For Douglas: You are my Vitamin D.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I extend thanks to my wonderful editors at Wiley: Elizabeth Rea, Chad 
Sievers, Todd Lothery, Stacy Kennedy, Lisa J. Cushman, and Mike Baker (fi rst 
edition). Many other people at Wiley worked hard to make both editions of 
this book a reality; special thanks go to Melisa Duffy, Lindsay MacGregor, 
Abbie Enneking, Grace Davis, and David Hobson.
Many colleagues and friends provided help. I enjoyed lively discussions with 
and gained much insight into the nature of the epigenome from Jonathan 
Weitzman. I thank Doug P. Lyle, MD, Walter D. Smith, Benoit Leclair, Maddy 
Delone, and Jen Dolan of the Innocence Project; and Jorge Berreno (Applied 
Biosystems, Inc.), Paul Farber (Oregon State University), Iris Sandler 
(University of Washington), Robert J. Robbins (Fred Hutchinson Cancer 
Research Center), and Garland E. Allen (Washington University in St. Louis) 
for assistance in preparing the fi rst edition. I am indebted to Peter and 
Rosemary Grant for fi gure-use permission. I also want to thank my post-
doctoral mentor, Colin Hughes (now of Florida Atlantic University). I send 
a hearty “War Eagle!” to my friends, former students, and colleagues from 
Auburn University, especially Mike and Marie Wooten, Sharon Roberts, and 
Shreekumar Pulai.
My deepest gratitude goes to my husband, Douglas, who hikes with me, 
makes me laugh, and keeps my perspective balanced. Finally, I thank my 
mom and dad for love, support, prayers, and gumbo.

Introduction
G
enetics affects all living things. Although sometimes complicated and 
always diverse, all genetics comes down to basic principles of heredity — 
how traits are passed from one generation to the next — and how DNA is put 
together. As a science, genetics is a fast growing field because of its untapped 
potential — for good and for bad. Despite its complexity, genetics can be sur-
prisingly accessible. Genetics is a bit like peeking behind a movie’s special 
effects to find a deceptively simple and elegant system running the whole show.
About This Book
Genetics For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is an overview of the entire field of genet-
ics. My goal is to explain every topic so that anyone, even someone without 
any genetics background at all, can follow the subject and understand how 
it works. As in the first edition, I include many examples from the frontiers 
of research. I also make sure that the book has detailed coverage of some 
of the hottest topics that you hear about in the news: cloning, gene therapy, 
and forensics. And I address the practical side of genetics: how it affects your 
health and the world around you. In short, this book is designed to be a solid 
introduction to genetics basics and to provide some details on the subject.
Genetics is a fast-paced field; new discoveries are coming out all the time. 
You can use this book to help you get through your genetics course or for 
self-guided study. Genetics For Dummies, 2nd Edition, provides enough 
information for you to get a handle on the latest press coverage, understand 
the genetics jargon that mystery writers like to toss around, and translate 
information imparted to you by medical professionals. The book is filled with 
stories of key discoveries and “wow” developments. Although I try to keep 
things light and inject some humor when possible, at the same time, I make 
every effort to be sensitive to whatever your circumstances may be.
This book is a great guide if you know nothing at all about genetics. If you 
already have some background, then you’re set to dive into the details of the 
subject and expand your horizons.

Conventions Used in This Book
I teach genetics in a university. It would be very easy for me to use specialized 
language that you’d need a translator to understand, but what fun would that 
be? Throughout this book, I avoid jargon as much as possible, but at the same 
time, I use and carefully define terms that scientists actually use. After all, it 
may be important for you to understand some of these multisyllabic jawbreak-
ers in the course of your studies or your, or a loved one’s, medical treatment.
To help you navigate through this book, I also use the following typographi-
cal conventions:
 
✓ I use italic for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that I 
define in the text.
 
✓ I use boldface to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or the action parts 
of numbered steps.
 
✓ I use monofont for Web sites and e-mail addresses. Note that some Web 
addresses may break across two lines of text. In such cases, I haven’t 
inserted any hyphens to indicate a break. So if you type exactly what 
you see — pretending that the line break doesn’t exist — you can get to 
your Web destination.
What You’re Not to Read
Anytime you see a Technical Stuff icon (see “Icons Used in This Book” later in 
this introduction), you can cruise past the information it’s attached to without 
missing a key explanation. For the serious reader (or a student intent on earn-
ing a high score), the technical bits add depth and detail to the book. You also 
have permission to skip the shaded gray boxes known as sidebars. Doing so 
doesn’t affect your understanding of the subject at hand, but I pull together 
lots of amazing details in these boxes — from how aging affects your DNA (and 
vice versa) to how genetics affects your food — so I’m guessing (or at least 
hoping!) that the sidebars will grab your attention more often than not.
Foolish Assumptions
It’s a privilege to be your guide into the amazing world of genetics. Given this 
responsibility, you were in my thoughts often while I was writing this book. 
Here’s how I imagine you, my reader:

3
 Introduction
 
✓ You’re a student in a genetics or biology class.
 
✓ You’re curious to understand more about the science you hear reported 
in the news.
 
✓ You’re an expectant or new parent or a family member who’s struggling 
to come to terms with what doctors have told you.
 
✓ You’re affected by cancer or some hereditary disease, wondering what it 
means for you and your family.
If any of these descriptions fit, you’ve come to the right place.
How This Book Is Organized
I designed this book to cover background material in the first two parts and 
then all the applications in the rest of the book. I think you’ll find it quite 
accessible.
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: 
Just the Basics
This part explains how trait inheritance works. The first chapter gives you 
a handle on how genetic information gets divvied up during cell division; 
these events provide the foundation for just about everything else that has 
to do with genetics. From there, I explain simple inheritance of one gene and 
then move on to more complex forms of inheritance. This part ends with an 
explanation of how sex works — that is, how genetics determines maleness 
or femaleness and how sex affects how your genes work. (If you’re wondering 
how sex really works, check out Sex For Dummies, coauthored by Dr. Ruth.)
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material
This part covers what’s sometimes called molecular genetics. But don’t let 
the word “molecular” scare you off. It’s the nitty-gritty details all right, but 
broken down so that you can easily follow along. I track the progress of how 
your genes work from start to finish: how your DNA is put together, how it 
gets copied, and how the building plans for your body are encoded in the 
double helix. To help you understand how scientists explore the secrets 
stored in your DNA, I cover how DNA is sequenced. In the process, I relate 
the fascinating story behind the Human Genome Project.

Genetics For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part III: Genetics and Your Health
Part III is intended to help you see how genetics affects your health and well-
being. I cover the subjects of genetic counseling, inherited diseases, genet-
ics and cancer, and chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome. I also 
include a chapter on gene therapy, a practice that may hold the key to cures 
or treatments for many of the disorders I describe in this part of the book.
Part IV: Genetics and Your World
This part explains the broader impact of genetics and covers some hot topics 
that are often in the news. I explain how various technologies work and 
highlight both the possibilities and the perils of each. I delve into population 
genetics (of both humans, past and present, and endangered animal species), 
evolution, DNA and forensics, genetically modified plants and animals, clon-
ing, and the issue of ethics, which is raised on a daily basis as scientists push 
the boundaries of the possible with cutting-edge technology.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In Part V, you get my lists of ten milestone events and important people that 
have shaped genetics history, ten of the next big things in the field, and ten 
“believe it or not” stories that can provide you with more insights on the 
issues found elsewhere in the book that interest you.
Icons Used in This Book
All For Dummies books use icons to help readers keep track of what’s what. 
Here’s a rundown of the icons I use in this book and what they all mean.
 
This icon flags information that’s critical to your understanding or that’s par-
ticularly important to keep in mind.
 
Points in the text where I provide added insight on how to get a better handle 
on a concept are found here. I draw on my teaching experience for these tips 
and alert you to other sources of information you can check out.

These details are useful but not necessary to know. If you’re a student, 
though, these sections may be especially important to you.
 
This icon points out stories about the people behind the science and accounts 
of how discoveries came about.
 
This fine piece of art alerts you to recent applications of genetics in the field

Where to Go from Here
With Genetics For Dummies, 2nd Edition, you can start anywhere, in any chap-
ter, and get a handle on what you’re interested in right away. I make gener-
ous use of cross-references throughout the book to help you get background 
details that you may have skipped earlier. The table of contents and index 
can point you to specific topics in a hurry, or you can just start at the begin-
ning and work your way straight through. If you read the book from front to 
back, you’ll get a short course in genetics in the style and order that it’s often 
taught in colleges and universities — Mendel first and DNA second.

Part I
The Lowdown 
on Genetics: 
Just the Basics

In this part . . .
F
irst and foremost, genetics is concerned with how 
traits are inherited. The process of cell division is 
central to how chromosomes are divvyed up among off-
spring. When genes are passed on, some are assertive and 
dominant while others are shy and recessive. The study of 
how different traits are inherited and expressed is called 
Mendelian genetics.
Genetics also determines your sex (as in maleness or 
femaleness), and your sex influences how certain traits 
are expressed. In this part, I explain what genetics is and 
what it’s used for, how cells divide, and how traits are 
passed from parents to offspring.

W
elcome to the complex and fascinating world of genetics. Genetics 
is all about physical traits and the DNA code that supplies the build-
ing plans for any organism. This chapter explains what the field of genetics 
is and what geneticists do. You get an introduction to the big picture and a 
glimpse at some of the details found in other chapters of this book.
What Is Genetics?
 
Genetics is the field of science that examines how traits are passed from one 
generation to the next. Simply put, genetics affects everything about every 
living thing on earth. An organism’s genes, snippets of DNA that are the funda-
mental units of heredity, control how the organism looks, behaves, and repro-
duces. Because all biology depends on genes, understanding genetics as a 
foundation for all other life sciences, including agriculture and medicine, is 
critical.
 
From a historical point of view, genetics is still a young science. The principles 
that govern inheritance of traits by one generation from another were described 
(and promptly lost) less than 150 years ago. Around the turn of the 20th cen-
tury, the laws of inheritance were rediscovered, an event that transformed 
biology forever. But even then, the importance of the star of the genetics 
show, DNA, wasn’t really understood until the 1950s. Now, technology is help-
ing geneticists push the envelope of knowledge every day.

10
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Genetics is generally divided into four major subdivisions:
 
✓ Classical, or Mendelian, genetics: A discipline that describes how 
physical characteristics (traits) are passed along from one generation to 
another.
 
✓ Molecular genetics: The study of the chemical and physical structures 
of DNA, its close cousin RNA, and proteins. Molecular genetics also 
covers how genes do their jobs.
 
✓ Population genetics: A division of genetics that looks at the genetic 
makeup of larger groups.
 
✓ Quantitative genetics: A highly mathematical field that examines the 
statistical relationships between genes and the traits they encode.
In the academic world, many genetics courses begin with classical genetics 
and proceed through molecular genetics, with a nod to population, evolution-
ary, or quantitative genetics. This book follows the same path, because each 
division of knowledge builds on the one before it. That said, it’s perfectly okay, 
and very easy, to jump around among disciplines. No matter how you take on 
reading this book, I provide lots of cross references to help you stay on track.
Classical genetics: Transmitting traits 
from generation to generation
 
At its heart, classical genetics is the genetics of individuals and their families. It 
focuses mostly on studying physical traits, or phenotypes, as a stand-in for the 
genes that control appearance.
 
Gregor Mendel, a humble monk and part-time scientist, founded the entire dis-
cipline of genetics. Mendel was a gardener with an insatiable curiosity to go 
along with his green thumb. His observations may have been simple, but his 
conclusions were jaw-droppingly elegant. This man had no access to technol-
ogy, computers, or a pocket calculator, yet he determined, with keen accu-
racy, exactly how inheritance works.
Classical genetics is sometimes referred to as:
 
✓ Mendelian genetics: You start a new scientific discipline, and it gets 
named after you. Seems fair.
 
✓ Transmission genetics: This term refers to the fact that classical genet-
ics describes how traits are passed on, or transmitted, by parents to 
their offspring.

11
 Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some
No matter what you call it, classical genetics includes the study of cells 
and chromosomes (which I delve into in Chapter 2). Cell division is the 
machine that drives inheritance, but you don’t have to understand combus-
tion engines to drive a car, right? Likewise, you can dive straight into simple 
inheritance (see Chapter 3) and work up to more complicated forms of inheri-
tance (in Chapter 4) without knowing anything whatsoever about cell divi-
sion. (Mendel didn’t know anything about chromosomes and cells when he 
figured this whole thing out, by the way.)
The genetics of sex and reproduction are also part of classical genetics. 
Various combinations of genes and chromosomes (strands of DNA) deter-
mine sex, as in maleness and femaleness. But the subject of sex gets even 
more complicated (and interesting): The environment plays a role in deter-
mining the sex of some organisms (like crocodiles and turtles), and other 
organisms can even change sex with a change of address. If I’ve piqued your 
interest, you can find out all the slightly kinky details in Chapter 5.
Classical genetics provides the framework for many subdisciplines. Genetic 
counseling (which I cover in Chapter 12) depends heavily on understanding 
patterns of inheritance to interpret people’s medical histories from a genetics 
perspective. The study of chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome 
(see Chapter 15) relies on cell biology and an understanding of what happens 
during cell division. Forensics (see Chapter 18) also uses Mendelian genetics 
to determine paternity and to work out who’s who with DNA fingerprinting.
Molecular genetics: DNA and 
the chemistry of genes
 
Classical genetics concentrates on studying outward appearances, but the 
study of actual genes falls under the heady title of molecular genetics. The area 
of operations for molecular genetics includes all the machinery that runs cells 
and manufactures the structures called for by the plans found in genes. The 
focus of molecular genetics includes the physical and chemical structures of 
the double helix, DNA, which I break down in all its glory in Chapter 6. The 
messages hidden in your DNA (your genes) constitute the building instruc-
tions for your appearance and everything else about you — from how your 
muscles function and how your eyes blink to your blood type, your suscepti-
bility to particular diseases, and everything in between.
Your genes are expressed through a complex system of interactions that 
begins with copying DNA’s messages into a somewhat temporary form called 
RNA (see Chapter 9). RNA carries the DNA message through the process of 
translation (covered in Chapter 10), which, in essence, is like taking a blue-
print to a factory to guide the manufacturing process. Where your genes are 
concerned, the factory makes the proteins (from the RNA blueprint) that get 
folded in complex ways to make you.

12
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
The study of gene expression (how genes get turned on and off; flip to 
Chapter 11) and how the genetic code works at the levels of DNA and RNA 
are considered parts of molecular genetics. Research on the causes of cancer 
and the hunt for a cure (which I address in Chapter 14) focuses on the 
molecular side of things, because changes (referred to as mutations) occur at 
the chemical level of DNA (see Chapter 13 for coverage of mutations). Gene 
therapy (see Chapter 16), genetic engineering (see Chapter 19), and cloning 
(see Chapter 20) are all subdisciplines of molecular genetics.
Population genetics: Genetics of groups
Much to the chagrin of many undergrads, genetics is surprisingly mathemati-
cal. One area in which calculations are used to describe what goes on geneti-
cally is population genetics.
 
If you take Mendelian genetics and examine the inheritance patterns of many 
different individuals who have something in common, like geographic loca-
tion, then you have population genetics. Population genetics is the study of the 
genetic diversity of a subset of a particular species (for details, jump to 
Chapter 17). In essence, it’s a search for patterns that help describe the 
genetic signature of a particular group, such as the consequences of travel, 
isolation (from other populations), mating choices, geography, and behavior.
 
Population genetics helps scientists understand how the collective genetic 
diversity of a population influences the health of individuals within the popu-
lation. For example, cheetahs are lanky cats; they’re the speed demons of 
Africa. Population genetics has revealed that all cheetahs are very, very genet-
ically similar; in fact, they’re so similar that a skin graft from one cheetah 
would be accepted by any other cheetah. Because the genetic diversity of 
cheetahs is so low, conservation biologists fear that a disease could sweep 
through the population and kill off all the individuals of the species. It’s possi-
ble that no animals would be resistant to the disease, and therefore, none 
would survive, leading to the extinction of this amazing predator.
Describing the genetics of populations from a mathematical standpoint is 
critical to forensics (see Chapter 18). To pinpoint the uniqueness of one 
DNA fingerprint, geneticists have to sample the genetic fingerprints of many 
individuals and decide how common or rare a particular pattern may be. 
Medicine also uses population genetics to determine how common particular 
mutations are and to develop new medicines to treat disease. For details on 
mutations, flip to Chapter 13; see Chapter 21 for information on genetics and 
the development of new medicines. Also, evolutionary genetics, or how traits 
change over time, is new to this edition; I cover the subject in Chapter 17.

13
 Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some
Quantitative genetics: Getting 
a handle on heredity
 
Quantitative genetics examines traits that vary in subtle ways and relates those 
traits to the underlying genetics of an organism. A combination of whole suites 
of genes and environmental factors controls characteristics like retrieving 
ability in dogs, egg size or number in birds, and running speed in humans. 
Mathematical in nature, quantitative genetics takes a rather complex statisti-
cal approach to estimate how much variation in a particular trait is due to the 
environment and how much is actually genetic.
One application of quantitative genetics is determining how heritable a par-
ticular trait is. This measure allows scientists to make predictions about 
how offspring will turn out based on characteristics of the parent organisms. 
Heritability gives some indication of how much a characteristic (like seed 
production) can change when selective breeding (or, in evolutionary time, 
natural selection) is applied.
Living the Life of a Geneticist
Daily life for a geneticist can include working in the lab, teaching in the class-
room, and interacting with patients and their families. In this section, you 
discover what a typical genetics lab is like and get a rundown of a variety of 
career paths in the genetics field.
Exploring a genetics lab
A genetics lab is a busy, noisy place. It’s full of equipment and supplies and 
researchers toiling away at their workstations (called lab benches, even 
though the bench is really just a raised, flat surface that’s conducive to work-
ing while standing up). Depending on the lab, you may see people looking 
very official in white lab coats or researchers dressed more casually in jeans 
and T-shirts. Every lab contains some or all of the following:
 
✓ Disposable gloves to protect workers from chemical exposure and to 
protect DNA and other materials from contamination.
 
✓ Pipettes (for measuring even the tiniest droplets of liquids with extreme 
accuracy), glassware (for liquid measurement and storage), and vials 
and tubes (for chemical reactions).
 
✓ Electronic balances for making super-precise measurements of mass.
 
✓ Chemicals and ultrapure water.

14
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
 
✓ A refrigerator (set at 40 degrees Fahrenheit), a freezer (at –4 degrees), 
and an ultracold freezer (at –112 degrees) for storing samples.
 
 Repeated freezing and thawing causes DNA to break into tiny pieces, 
which destroys it. For that reason, freezers used in genetics labs aren’t 
frost-free, because the temperature inside a frost-free freezer cycles up 
and down to melt any ice that forms.
 
✓ Centrifuges for separating substances from each other. Given that dif-
ferent substances have different densities, centrifuges spin at extremely 
high speeds to force materials to separate so that researchers can 
handle them individually.
 
✓ Incubators for growing bacteria under controlled conditions. Researchers 
often use bacteria for experimental tests of how genes work.
 
✓ Autoclaves for sterilizing glassware and other equipment using extreme 
heat and pressure to kill bacteria and viruses.
 
✓ Complex pieces of equipment such as thermocyclers (used for PCR; see 
Chapter 18) and DNA sequencers (see Chapter 8).
 
✓ Lab notebooks for recording every step of every reaction or experiment 
in nauseating detail. Geneticists must fully replicate (run over and over) 
every experiment to make sure the results are valid. The lab notebook is 
also a legal document that can be used in court cases, so precision and 
completeness are musts.
 
✓ Desktop computers packed with software for analyzing results and for 
connecting via the Internet to vast databases packed with genetic infor-
mation (flip to the end of this chapter for the addresses of some useful 
Web sites).
Researchers in the lab use the various pieces of equipment and supplies from 
the preceding list to conduct experiments and run chemical reactions. Some 
of the common activities that occur in the genetics lab include
 
✓ Separating DNA from the rest of a cell’s contents (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Measuring the purity of a DNA sample and determining how much DNA 
(by weight) is present.
 
✓ Mixing chemicals that are used in reactions and experiments designed 
to analyze DNA samples.
 
✓ Growing special strains of bacteria and viruses to aid in examining short 
stretches of DNA (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ Using DNA sequencing (which I cover in Chapter 8) to learn the order of 
bases that compose a DNA strand (which I explain in Chapter 6).
 
✓ Setting up polymerase chain reactions, or PCR (see Chapter 18), a pow-
erful process that allows scientists to analyze even very tiny amounts 
of DNA.

15
 Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some
 
✓ Analyzing the results of DNA sequencing by comparing sequences from 
many different organisms (you can find this information in a massive, 
publicly available database — see the end of this chapter).
 
✓ Comparing DNA fingerprints from several individuals to identify perpe-
trators or to assign paternity (see Chapter 18).
 
✓ Holding weekly or daily meetings where everyone in the lab comes 
together to discuss results or plan new experiments.
Sorting through jobs in genetics
Whole teams of people contribute to the study of genetics. The following are 
just a few job descriptions for you to mull over if you’re considering a career 
in genetics.
Lab tech
Lab technicians handle most of the day-to-day work in the lab. The tech 
mixes chemicals for everyone else in the lab to use in experiments. Techs 
usually prepare the right sorts of materials to grow bacteria (which are 
used as carriers for DNA; see Chapter 16), set up the bacterial cultures, and 
monitor their growth. Techs are also usually responsible for keeping all the 
necessary supplies straight and washing the glassware — not a glamorous 
job but a necessary one, because labs use tons of glass beakers and flasks 
that have to be cleaned.
When it comes to actual experiments, lab technicians are responsible for 
separating the DNA from the rest of the tissue around it and testing it for 
purity (to make sure no contaminants, like proteins, are present). Using a 
rather complicated machine with a strong laser, the tech can also measure 
exactly how much DNA is present. When a sufficiently pure sample of DNA is 
obtained, techs may analyze the DNA in greater detail (with PCR or sequenc-
ing reactions).
The educational background needed to be a lab tech varies with the amount 
of responsibility a particular position demands. Most techs have a minimum 
of a bachelor’s degree in biology or some related field and need some back-
ground in microbiology to understand and carry out the techniques of han-
dling bacteria safely and without contaminating cultures. And all techs must 
be good record-keepers, because every single activity in the lab must be 
documented in writing in the lab notebook.
Graduate student and post-doc
At most universities, genetics labs are full of graduate students working on 
either master’s degrees or PhDs. In some labs, these students may be carry-
ing out their own, independent research. On the other hand, many labs focus 
their work on a specific problem, like some specialized approach to studying 

16
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
cancer, and every student in that sort of lab works on some aspect of what 
his or her professor studies. Graduate students do a lot of the same things 
that lab techs do (see the preceding section), as well as design experiments, 
carry out those experiments, analyze the results, and then work to figure out 
what the results mean. Then, the graduate student writes a long document 
(called a thesis or dissertation) to describe what was done, what it means, and 
how it fits in with other people’s research on the subject. While working in 
the lab, grad students take classes and are subjected to grueling exams (trust 
me on the grueling part).
All graduate students must hold a bachelor’s degree. Performance on the 
standardized GRE (Graduate Record Exam) determines eligibility for admis-
sion to master’s programs and may be used for selection for fellowships and 
awards.
 
If you’re going to be staring down this test in the near future, you may want to 
get a leg up by checking out The GRE Test For Dummies, by Suzee Vlk, Michelle 
Rose Gilman, and Veronica Saydak (Wiley).
In general, it takes two or three years to earn a master’s degree. A doctorate 
(denoted by PhD) usually requires anywhere from four to seven years of edu-
cation beyond the bachelor’s level.
After graduating with a PhD, a geneticist-in-training may need to get more 
experience before hitting the job market. Positions that provide such experi-
ence are collectively referred to as post-docs (post-doctoral fellows). A person 
holding a post-doc position is usually much more independent than a grad 
student when it comes to research. The post-doc often works to learn new 
techniques or to acquire a specialty before moving on to a position as a pro-
fessor or a research scientist.
Research scientist
Research scientists work in private industries, designing experiments and 
directing the activities of lab techs. All sorts of industries employ research 
scientists, including
 
✓ Pharmaceutical companies, to conduct investigations on how drugs 
affect gene expression (see Chapter 11) and to develop new treatments 
such as gene therapy (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ Forensics labs, to analyze DNA found at crime scenes and to compare 
DNA fingerprints (see Chapter 18).
 
✓ Companies that analyze information generated by genome projects 
(human and others; see Chapter 11).
 
✓ Companies that support the work of other genetics labs by designing 
and marketing products used in research, such as kits used to run DNA 
fingerprints.

17
 Chapter 1: What Genetics Is and Why You Need to Know Some
A research scientist usually holds a master’s degree or a PhD. With only 
a bachelor’s degree, several years of experience as a lab tech may suffice. 
Research scientists have to be able to design experiments and analyze 
results using statistics. Good record-keeping and strong communication skills 
(especially in writing) are musts. Most research scientists also have to be 
capable of managing and supervising people. In addition, financial responsi-
bilities may include keeping up with expenditures, ordering equipment and 
supplies, and wrangling salaries of other personnel.
College or university professor
Professors do everything that research scientists do with the added respon-
sibilities of teaching courses, writing proposals to get funds to support 
research, and writing papers on their research results for publication in repu-
table, peer-reviewed journals. Professors also supervise the lab techs, gradu-
ate students, and post-docs who work in their labs, which entails designing 
research projects and then ensuring that the projects are done correctly in 
the right amount of time (and under budget!).
Small schools may require a professor to teach as many as three courses 
every semester. Upper-tier institutions (think Big Ten or Ivy League) may 
require only one course of instruction per year. Genetics professors teach 
the basics as well as advanced and specialty courses like recombinant DNA 
(see Chapter 16) and population genetics (see Chapter 17).
To qualify for a professorship, universities require a minimum of a PhD, and 
most require additional post-doctoral experience. Job candidates must have 
already published research results to demonstrate the ability to do relevant 
research. Most universities also look for evidence that the professor-to-be 
will be successful at getting grants, which means the candidate must usually

Genetic counselors work with medical personnel to interpret the medical 
histories of patients and their families. The counselor usually works directly 
with the patient to assemble all the information into a family tree (see 
Chapter 12) and then looks for patterns to determine which traits may be 
hereditary. Counselors can also tell which diseases a patient is most likely to 
inherit. Genetic counselors are trained to conduct careful and thorough inter-
views to make sure that no information is missed or left out.
Genetic counselors usually hold a master’s degree. Training includes many 
hours working with patients to hone interview and analysis skills (under 
the close supervision of experienced professionals, of course). The position 
requires excellent record-keeping skills and strict attention to detail. Genetic 
counselors also have to be good at interacting with all kinds of people, 
including research scientists and physicians. And the ability to communicate 
very well, both in writing and verbally, is a must.

The most essential skill of a genetic counselor is the ability to be nonjudgmen-
tal and nondirective. The counselor must be able to analyze a family history 
without bias or prejudice and inform the patient of his or her options without 
recommending any one course of action over another. Furthermore, the coun-
selor must keep all information about his or her patients confidential, sharing 
information only with authorized personnel such as the person’s own physi-
cian in order to protect the patient’s privacy.

G
enetics and the study of how cells work are closely related. The 
process of passing genetic material from one generation to the next 
depends completely on how cells grow and divide. To reproduce, a simple 
organism such as bacteria or yeast simply copies its DNA (through a process 
called replication, which I cover in Chapter 7) and splits in two. But organ-
isms that reproduce sexually go through a complicated dance that includes 
mixing and matching strands of DNA (a process called recombination) and 
then halving the amount of DNA for special sex cells, allowing completely 
new genetic combinations for their offspring. These amazing processes are 
part of what makes you unique. So come inside your cell — you need to be 
familiar with the processes of mitosis (cell division) and meiosis (the produc-
tion of sex cells) to appreciate how genetics works.
Looking Around Your Cell
 
There are two basic kinds of organisms:
 
✓ Prokaryotes: Organisms whose cells lack a nucleus and therefore have 
DNA floating loosely in the liquid center of the cell
 
✓ Eukaryotes: Organisms that have a well-defined nucleus to house and 
protect the DNA
A nucleus is a compartment filled with DNA surrounded by a membrane.
The basic biologies of prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar but not identi-
cal. Because all living things fall into these two groups, understanding the 
differences and similarities between cell types is important. In this section, I

show you how to distinguish the two kinds of cells from each other, and you 
get a quick tour of the insides of cells — both with and without nuclei. Figure 
2-1 shows you the structure of each type of cell.

Cells without a nucleus
Scientists classify organisms composed of cells without nuclei as prokaryotes, 
which means “before nucleus.” Prokaryotes are the most common forms of 
life on earth. You are, at this very moment, covered in and inhabited by mil-
lions of prokaryotic cells: bacteria. Much of your life and your body’s pro-
cesses depend on these arrangements; for example, the digestion going on 
in your intestines is partially powered by bacteria that break down the food 
you eat. Most of the bacteria in your body are completely harmless, but some 
species of bacteria can be vicious and deadly, causing rapidly transmitted 
diseases such as cholera.
All bacteria, regardless of temperament, are simple, one-celled, prokaryotic 
organisms. None has cell nuclei, and all are small cells with relatively small 
amounts of DNA (see Chapter 8 for more on the amounts of DNA different 
organisms possess).
The exterior of a prokaryotic cell is encapsulated by a cell wall that serves as 
the bacteria’s only protection from the outside world. A plasma membrane 
(membranes are thin sheets or layers) regulates the exchange of nutrients, 
water, and gases that nourish the bacterial cell. DNA, usually in the form of 
a single, hoop-shaped piece, floats around inside the cell; segments of DNA 

21
 Chapter 2: Basic Cell Biology
like this one are called chromosomes (see the section “Examining the basics 
of chromosomes” later in the chapter). The liquid interior of the cell is called 
the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm provides a cushiony, watery home for the DNA 
and other cell machinery that carry out the business of living. Prokaryotes 
divide, and thus reproduce, by simple mitosis, which I cover in detail in the 
“Mitosis: Splitting Up” section later in the chapter.
Cells with a nucleus
Scientists classify organisms that have cells with nuclei as eukaryotes, 
which means “true nucleus.” Eukaryotes range in complexity from simple, 
one-celled animals and plants to complex, multicellular organisms like you. 
Eukaryotic cells are fairly complicated and have numerous parts to keep 
track of (refer to Figure 2-1). Like prokaryotes, eukaryotic cells are held 
together by a plasma membrane, and sometimes a cell wall surrounds the 
membrane (plants, for example, have cell walls). But that’s where the simi-
larities end.
 
The most important feature of the eukaryotic cell is the nucleus — the 
membrane-surrounded compartment that houses the DNA that’s divided into 
one or more chromosomes. The nucleus protects the DNA from damage during 
day-to-day living. Eukaryotic chromosomes are usually long, string-like seg-
ments of DNA instead of the hoop-shaped ones found in prokaryotes. Another 
hallmark of eukaryotes is the way the DNA is packaged: Eukaryotes usually have 
much larger amounts of DNA than prokaryotes, and to fit all that DNA into the 
tiny cell nucleus, it must be tightly wound around special proteins. (For all the 
details about DNA packaging for eukaryotes, flip to Chapter 6.)
Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have all sorts of cell parts, called organelles, that 
help carry out the business of living. The organelles float around in the watery 
cytoplasm outside the nucleus. Two of the most important organelles are
 
✓ Mitochondria: The powerhouses of the eukaryotic cell, mitochondria 
pump out energy by converting glucose to ATP (adenosine triphos-
phate). ATP acts like a battery of sorts, storing energy until it’s needed 
for day-to-day living. Both animals and plants have mitochondria.
 
✓ Chloroplasts: These organelles are unique to plants. They process the 
energy of sunlight into sugars that the plant mitochondria use to gener-
ate the energy that nourishes the living cells.
Eukaryotic cells are able to carry out behaviors that prokaryotes can’t. For 
example, one-celled eukaryotes often have appendages, such as long tails 
(called flagella) or hair-like projections (called cilia), that work like hundreds 
of tiny paddles, helping them move around. Also, only eukaryotic cells are 
capable of ingesting fluids and particles for nutrition; prokaryotes must trans-
port materials through their cell walls, a process that severely limits their 
dietary options.

22
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
In most multicellular eukaryotes, cells come in two basic varieties: body cells 
(called somatic cells) or sex cells. The two cell types have different functions 
and are produced in different ways.
Somatic cells
Somatic cells are produced by simple cell division called mitosis (see the sec-
tion “Mitosis: Splitting Up” for details). Somatic cells of multicellular organ-
isms like humans are differentiated into special cell types. Skin cells and 
muscle cells are both somatic cells, for instance, but if you were to examine 
your skin cells under a microscope and compare them with your muscle 
cells, you’d see that their structures are very different. The various cells that 
make up your body all have the same basic components (membrane, organ-
elles, and so on), but the arrangements of the elements change from one cell 
type to the next so that they can carry out various jobs such as digestion 
(intestinal cells), energy storage (fat cells), or oxygen transport to your tis-
sues (blood cells).
Sex cells
Sex cells are specialized cells used for reproduction. Only eukaryotic organ-
isms engage in sexual reproduction, which I cover in detail at the end of this 
chapter in the section “Mommy, where did I come from?” Sexual reproduc-
tion combines genetic material from two organisms and requires special 
preparation in the form of a reduction in the amount of genetic material allo-
cated to sex cells — a process called meiosis (see “Meiosis: Making Cells for 
Reproduction” later in the chapter for an explanation). In humans, the two 
types of sex cells are eggs and sperm.
Examining the basics of chromosomes
Chromosomes are threadlike strands composed of DNA. To pass genetic 
traits from one generation to the next, the chromosomes must be copied (see 
Chapter 7), and then the copies must be divvied up. Most prokaryotes have 
only one circular chromosome that, when copied, is passed on to the daugh-
ter cells (new cells created by cell division) during mitosis. Eukaryotes have 
more complex problems to solve (like divvying up half of the chromosomes 
to make sex cells), and their chromosomes behave differently during mitosis 
and meiosis. Additionally, various scientific terms describe the anatomy, 
shapes, number of copies, and situations of eukaryotic chromosomes. This 
section gets into the intricacies of chromosomes in eukaryotic cells because 
they’re so complex.
Counting out chromosome numbers
Each eukaryotic organism has a specific number of chromosomes per cell — 
ranging from one to many. For example, humans have 46 total chromosomes. 
These chromosomes come in two varieties:

23
 Chapter 2: Basic Cell Biology
 
✓ Sex chromosomes: These chromosomes determine gender. Human cells 
contain two sex chromosomes. If you’re female, you have two X chromo-
somes, and if you’re male, you have an X and a Y chromosome. (To find 
out more about how sex is determined by the X and Y chromosomes, 
flip to Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Autosomal chromosomes: Autosomal simply refers to non-sex chromo-
somes. Sticking with the human example, if you do the math, you can 
see that humans have 44 autosomal chromosomes.
Ah, but there’s more. In humans, chromosomes come in pairs. That means 
you have 22 pairs of uniquely shaped autosomal chromosomes plus 1 pair of 
sex chromosomes for a total of 23 chromosome pairs. Your autosomal chro-
mosomes are identified by numbers — 1 through 22. So you have two chromo-
some 1s, two 2s, and so on. Figure 2-2 shows you how all human chromosomes 
are divided into pairs and numbered. (A karyotype like the one pictured in 
Figure 2-2 is one way chromosomes are examined; you discover more about 
karyotyping in Chapter 15.)
When chromosomes are sorted into pairs, the individual chromosomes in 
each pair are considered homologous, meaning that the paired chromosomes 
are identical to one another according to which genes they carry. In addition, 
your homologous chromosomes are identical in shape and size. These pairs 
of chromosomes are sometimes referred to as homologs for short.
Chromosome numbers can be a bit confusing. Humans are diploid, meaning 
we have two copies of each chromosome. Some organisms (like bees and 
wasps) have only one set of chromosomes (cells with one set of chromo-
somes are called haploid); others have three, four, or as many as sixteen 
copies of each chromosome! The number of chromosome sets held by a par-
ticular organism is called the ploidy. For more on chromosome numbers, see 
Chapter 15.
The total number of chromosomes doesn’t tell you what the ploidy of an 
organism is. For that reason, the number of chromosomes an organism has is 
often listed as some multiple of n. A single set of chromosomes referred to by 
the n is the haploid number. Humans are 2n = 46 (indicating that humans are 
diploid and their total number of chromosomes is 46). Human sex cells such 
as eggs or sperm are haploid (see “Mommy, where did I come from?” later in 
this chapter).
 
Geneticists believe that the homologous pairs of chromosomes in humans 
started as one set (that is, haploid), and the entire set was duplicated at some 
point in some distant ancestor, many millions of years ago.
Examining chromosome anatomy
Chromosomes are often depicted in stick-like forms, like those you see in 
Figure 2-3. Chromosomes don’t look like sticks, though. In fact, most of the 
time they’re loose and string-like. Chromosomes only take on this distinctive 

24
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
shape and form when cell division is about to take place (during metaphase 
of meiosis or mitosis). They’re often drawn this way so that the special char-
acteristics of eukaryotic chromosomes are easier to see. Figure 2-3 points out 
the important features of eukaryotic chromosomes.

The part of the chromosome that appears pinched (in Figure 2-3, located in the 
middle of the chromosomes) is called the centromere. The placement of the 
centromere (whether it’s closer to the top, middle, or bottom of the chromo-
some; see Figure 2-4) is what gives each chromosome its unique shape. The 
ends of the chromosomes are called telomeres. Telomeres are made of densely 
packed DNA and serve to protect the DNA message that the chromosome car-
ries. (Flip to Chapter 23 for more about telomeres and how they may affect the 
process of aging.)
 
The differences in shapes and sizes of chromosomes are easy to see, but the 
most important differences between chromosomes are hidden deep inside the 
DNA. Chromosomes carry genes — sections of DNA that make up the building 
plans for physical traits. The genes tell the body how, when, and where to 
make all the structures that are necessary for the processes of living (for more 
on how genes work, flip to Chapter 11). Each pair of homologous chromo-
somes carries the same — but not necessarily identical — genes. For example, 

25
 Chapter 2: Basic Cell Biology
both chromosomes of a particular homologous pair may contain the gene for 
hair color, but one can be a “brown hair” version of the gene — alternative 
versions of genes are called alleles (refer to Figure 2-3) — and the other can be 
a “blond hair” allele.
Any given gene can have one or more alleles. In Figure 2-3, one chromosome 
carries the allele A while its homolog carries the allele a (the relative size of 
an allele is very small; the alleles are large here so you can see them). The 
alleles code for the different physical traits (phenotypes) you see in animals 
and plants, like hair color or flower shape. You can find out more about how 
alleles affect phenotype in Chapter 3.

Each point along the chromosome is called a locus (Latin for “place”). The 
plural of locus is loci (pronounced low-sigh). Most of the phenotypes that you 
see are produced by multiple genes (that is, genes occurring at different loci 
and often on different chromosomes) acting together. For instance, human 

26

eye color is determined by at least three genes that reside on two different 
chromosomes. You can find out more about how genes are arranged along 
chromosomes in Chapter 15.
Mitosis: Splitting Up
Most cells have simple lifestyles: They grow, divide, and eventually die. 
Figure 2-5 illustrates the basic life cycle of a typical somatic, or body, cell.
The cell cycle (the stages a cell goes through from one division to another) is 
tightly regulated; some cells divide all the time, and others never divide at all. 
Your body uses mitosis to provide new cells when you grow and to replace 
cells that wear out or become damaged from injury. Talk about multitasking — 
you’re going through mitosis right now, while you read this book! Some cells 
divide only part of the time, when new cells are needed to handle certain jobs 
like fighting infection. Cancer cells, on the other hand, get carried away and 
divide too often. (In Chapter 14, you can find out how the cell cycle is regulated 
and what happens when it goes awry.)
 
The cell cycle includes mitosis — the process of reproducing the cell nucleus 
by division. The result of each round of the cell cycle is a simple cell division 
that creates two identical new cells from one original cell. During mitosis, all 
DNA present in the cell is copied (see Chapter 7), and when the original cell 
divides, a complete collection of all the chromosomes (in humans, 23 pairs) 
goes to each of the two resulting cells. Prokaryotes and some simple eukary-
otic organisms use mitosis to reproduce themselves. (More complex eukary-
otic organisms use meiosis for sexual reproduction, in which each of the two 
sex cells sends only one copy of each chromosome into the eggs or sperm. 
You can read all about that in the section “Meiosis: Making Cells for 
Reproduction” later in this chapter.)

 Chapter 2: Basic Cell Biology
 
You should remember two important points about mitosis:
 
✓ Mitosis produces two identical cells. The new cells are identical to each 
other and to the cell that divided to create them.
 
✓ Cells created by mitosis have exactly the same number of chromo-
somes as the original cell did. If the original cell had 46 chromosomes, 
the new cells each have 46 chromosomes.
Mitosis is only one of the major phases in the cell cycle; the other is inter-
phase. In the following sections, I guide you through the phases of the cell 
cycle and tell you exactly what happens during each one.
Step 1: Time to grow
Interphase is the part of the cell cycle during which the cell grows, copies its 
DNA, and prepares to divide. Interphase occurs in three stages: the G1 phase, 
the S phase, and the G2 phase.
G1 phase
When a cell begins life, such as the moment an egg is fertilized, the first thing 
that happens is the original cell starts to grow. This period of growth is called 
the G1 phase of interphase. Lots of things happen during G1: DNA supervises 
the work of the cell, metabolism (the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide) 
occurs, and cells breathe and “eat.”
Some cells opt out of the cell cycle permanently, stop growing, and exit the 
process at G0. Your brain cells, for example, have retired from the cell cycle. 
Mature red blood cells and muscle cells don’t divide, either. In fact, human 
red blood cells have no nuclei and thus possess no DNA of their own.
If the cell in question plans to divide, though, it can’t stay in G1 forever. 
Actively dividing cells go through the whole cell cycle every 24 hours or so. 
After a predetermined period of growth that lasts from a few minutes to sev-
eral hours, the cell arrives at the first checkpoint (refer to Figure 2-5). When 
the cell passes the first checkpoint, there’s no turning back.
 
Various proteins control when the cell moves from one phase of the cycle to 
the next. At the first checkpoint, proteins called cyclins and enzymes called 
kinases control the border between G1 and the next phase. Cyclins and 
kinases interact to cue up the various stages of the merry-go-round of cell divi-
sion. Two particular chemicals, CDK (cyclin dependent kinase) and G1 cyclin, 
hook up to escort the cell over the border from G1 to S — the next phase.

28
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
S phase
S phase is the point at which the cell’s DNA is replicated (here, S refers to 
synthesis, or copying, of the DNA). When the cell enters the S phase, activ-
ity around the chromosomes really steps up. All the chromosomes must be 
copied to make exact replicas that later are passed on to the newly formed 
daughter cells produced by cell division. DNA replication is a very complex 
process that gets full coverage in Chapter 7.
 
For now, all you need to know is that all the cell’s chromosomes are copied 
during S, and the copies stay together as a unit (joined at the centromere; 
refer back to Figure 2-3) when the cell moves from S into G2 — the final step in 
interphase. The replicated chromosomes are called sister chromatids (refer to 
Figure 2-3), which are alike in every way. They carry the exact same copies of 
the exact same genes. During mitosis (or meiosis), the sister chromatids are 
divided up and sent to the daughter cells as part of the cell cycle.
G2 phase
The G2 phase leads up to cell division. It’s the last phase before actual mito-
sis gets underway. G2, sometimes called Gap 2, gives the cell time to get 
bigger before splitting into two smaller cells. Another set of cyclins and CDK 
work together to push the cell through the second checkpoint located at the 
border between G2 and mitosis. (For details on the first checkpoint, jump 
back to the section “G1 phase.”) As the cell grows, the chromosomes, now 
copied and hooked together as sister chromatids, stay together inside the 
cell nucleus. (The DNA is still “relaxed” at this point and hasn’t yet taken on 
the fat, sausage-shaped appearance it assumes during mitosis.) After the cell 
crosses the G2/M checkpoint (refer to Figure 2-5), the business of mitosis for-
mally gets underway.
Step 2: Divvying up the chromosomes
In the cell cycle, mitosis is the process of dividing up the newly copied 
chromosomes (that were created in interphase; see the preceding section) 
to make certain that the new cells each get a full set. Generally, mitosis is 
divided into four phases, which you can see in Figure 2-6 and read about in 
the following sections.
 
The phases of mitosis are a bit artificial, because the movement doesn’t stop 
at each point; instead, the chromosomes cruise right from one phase to the 
next. But dividing the process into phases is useful for understanding how the 
chromosomes go from being all mixed together to neatly parting ways and get-
ting into the proper, newly formed cells.

Prophase
During prophase, the chromosomes get very compact and condensed, taking 
on the familiar sausage shape. During interphase (see the “Step 1: Time to 
grow” section earlier in this chapter), the DNA that makes up the chromo-
somes is tightly wound around special proteins, sort of like string wrapped 
around beads. The whole “necklace” is wound tightly on itself to compress 
the enormous DNA molecules to sizes small enough to fit inside the cell 
nucleus. But even when coiled during interphase, the chromosomes are still 
so threadlike and tiny that they’re essentially invisible. That changes during 
prophase, when the chromosomes become so densely packed that you can 
easily see them with an ordinary light microscope.
 
By the time they reach prophase, chromosomes have duplicated to form 
sister chromatids (refer to Figure 2-3). Sister chromatids of each chromosome 
are exact twin copies of each other. Each chromatid is actually a chromosome 
in its own right, but thinking of chromosomes as chromatids may help you 
keep all the players straight during the process of division.
As the chromosomes/chromatids condense, the cell nucleus starts breaking 
up, allowing the chromosomes to move freely across the cell as the process 
of cell division progresses.

30
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Metaphase
Metaphase is the point when the chromosomes all line up in the center of 
the cell. After the nuclear membrane dissolves and prophase is complete, 
the chromosomes go from being a tangled mass to lining up in a more or 
less neat row in the center of the cell (refer to Figure 2-6). Threadlike strands 
called spindles grab each chromosome around its waist-like centromere. The 
spindles are attached to points on either side of the cell called poles.
 
Sometimes, scientists use geographic terms to describe the positions of chro-
mosomes during metaphase: The chromosomes line up at the equator and are 
attached to the poles. This trick may help you better visualize the events of 
metaphase.
Anaphase
During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart, and the resulting 
halves migrate to opposite poles (refer to Figure 2-6). At this point, it’s easy 
to see that the chromatids are actually chromosomes. Every sister chromatid 
gets split apart so that the cell that’s about to be formed ends up with a full 
set of all the original cell’s chromosomes.
Telophase
Finally, during telophase, nuclear membranes begin to form around the two 
sets of separated chromosomes (refer to Figure 2-6). The chromosomes 
begin to relax and take on their usual interphase form. The cell itself begins 
to divide as telophase comes to an end.
Step 3: The big divide
When mitosis is complete and new nuclei have formed, the cell divides into 
two smaller, identical cells. The division of one cell into two is called cyto-
kinesis (cyto meaning “cell” and kinesis meaning “movement”). Technically, 
cytokinesis happens after metaphase is over and before interphase begins. 
Each new cell has a full set of chromosomes, just as the original cell did. 
All the organelles and cytoplasm present in the original cell are divided up 
to provide the new cell with all the machinery it needs for metabolism and 
growth. The new cells are now at interphase (specifically, the G1 stage) and 
are ready to begin the cell cycle again.
Meiosis: Making Cells for Reproduction
Meiosis is a cell division that includes reducing the chromosome number 
as preparation for sexual reproduction. Meiosis reduces the amount of 
DNA by half so that when fertilization occurs, each offspring gets a full set 

31
 Chapter 2: Basic Cell Biology
of chromosomes. As a result of meiosis, the cell goes from being diploid to 
being haploid. Or, to put it another way, the cell goes from being 2n to being 
n. In humans, this means that the cells produced by meiosis (either eggs or 
sperm) have 23 chromosomes each — one copy of each of the homologous 
chromosomes. (See the section “Counting out chromosome numbers” earlier 
in this chapter for more information.)
 
Meiosis has many characteristics in common with mitosis. The stages go by 
similar names, and the chromosomes move around similarly, but the products 
of meiosis are completely different from those of mitosis. Whereas mitosis 
ends with two identical cells, meiosis produces four cells each with half the 
amount of DNA that the original cell contained. Furthermore, with meiosis, the 
homologous chromosomes go through a complex exchange of segments of 
DNA called recombination. Recombination is one of the most important 
aspects of meiosis and leads to genetic variation that allows each individual 
produced by sexual reproduction to be truly unique.
Meiosis goes through two rounds of division: meiosis I and the sequel, meio-
sis II. Figure 2-7 shows the progressing stages of both meiosis I and meiosis II. 
Unlike lots of movie sequels, the sequel in meiosis is really necessary. In both 
rounds of division, the chromosomes go through stages that resemble those 
in mitosis. However, the chromosomes undergo different actions in meiotic 
prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
 
Students often get stuck on the phases of meiosis and miss its most important 
aspects: recombination and the division of the chromosomes. To prevent that 
sort of confusion, I don’t break down meiosis by phases. Instead, I focus on 
the activities of the chromosomes themselves.
In meiosis I:
 
✓ The homologous pairs of chromosomes line up side by side and 
exchange parts. This is called crossing-over or recombination, and it 
occurs during prophase I.
 
✓ During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes line up at the equa-
tor of the cell (called the metaphase plate), and homologs go to opposite

✓ The cell divides in telophase I, reducing the amount of genetic material 
by half, and enters a second round of division — meiosis II.
During meiosis II:
 
✓ The individual chromosomes (as sister chromatids) condense during pro-
phase II and line up at the metaphase plates of both cells (metaphase II).
 
✓ The chromatids separate and go to opposite poles (anaphase II).
 
✓ The cells divide, resulting in a total of four daughter cells, each possess-
ing one copy of each chromosome.

Meiosis part I
Cells that undergo meiosis start in a phase similar to the interphase that pre-
cedes mitosis. The cells grow in a G1 phase, undergo DNA replication during 
S, and prepare for division during G2. (To review what happens in each of 
these phases, flip back to the section “Step 1: Time to grow.”) When meiosis 
is about to begin, the chromosomes condense. By the time meiotic inter-
phase is complete, the chromosomes have been copied and are hitched up as 
sister chromatids, just as they would be in mitosis. Next up are the phases of 
meiosis I, which I profile in the sections that follow.
Find your partner
During prophase I (labeled “I” because it’s in the first round of meiosis), the 
homologous chromosomes find each other. These homologous chromo-
somes originally came from the mother and father of the individual whose 
cells are now undergoing meiosis. Thus, during meiosis, maternal and 
paternal chromosomes, as homologs, line up side by side. In Figure 2-2, you 
can see an entire set of 46 human chromosomes. Although the members of 

33
 Chapter 2: Basic Cell Biology
the pair seem identical, they’re not. The homologous chromosomes have 
different combinations of alleles at the thousands of loci along each chro-
mosome. (For more on alleles, jump to the section “Examining chromosome 
anatomy” earlier in this chapter.)
Recombining makes you unique
When the homologous chromosomes pair up in prophase I, the chromatids 
of the two homologs actually zip together, and the chromatids exchange 
parts of their arms. Enzymes cut the chromosomes into pieces and seal the 
newly combined strands back together in an action called crossing-over. 
When crossing-over is complete, the chromatids consist of part of their 
original DNA and part of their homolog’s DNA. The loci don’t get mixed up or 
turned around — the chromosome sequence stays in its original order. The 
only thing that’s different is that the maternal and paternal chromosomes (as 
homologs) are now mixed together.
Figure 2-8 illustrates crossing-over in action. The figure shows one pair of 
homologous chromosomes and two loci. At both loci, the chromosomes 
have alternative forms of the genes. In other words, the alleles are differ-
ent: Homolog one has A and b, and homolog two has a and B. When replica-
tion takes place, the sister chromatids are identical (because they’re exact 
copies of each other). After crossing-over, the two sister chromatids have 
exchanged arms. Thus, each homolog has a sister chromatid that’s different.
Partners divide
The recombined homologs line up at the metaphase equator of the cell (refer 
to Figure 2-7). The nuclear membrane begins to break down, and in a process 
similar to mitotic anaphase, spindle fibers grasp the homologous chromo-
somes by their centromeres and pull them to opposite sides of the cell.
At the end of the first phase of meiosis, the cell undergoes its first round of 
division (telophase 1, followed by cytokinesis 1). The newly divided cells 
each contain one set of chromosomes, the now partnerless homologs, still in 
the form of replicated sister chromatids.
 
When the homologs line up, maternal and paternal chromosomes pair up, but 
it’s a tossup as to which side of the equator each one ends up on. Therefore, 
each pair of homologs divides independently of every other homologous pair. 
This is the basis of the principle of independent assortment, which I cover in 
Chapters 3 and 4.
Following telophase I, the cells enter an in-between round called interkinesis 
(which means “between movements”). The chromosomes relax and lose their 
fat, ready-for-metaphase appearance. Interkinesis is just a “resting” phase in 
preparation for the second round of meiosis.

Meiosis II: The sequel
Meiosis II is the second phase of cell division that produces the final prod-
uct of meiosis: cells that contain only one copy of each chromosome. The 
chromosomes condense once more to their now-familiar fat, sausage shapes. 
Keep in mind that each cell has only a single set of chromosomes, which are 
still in the form of sister chromatids.
During metaphase II, the chromosomes line up along the equator of the cells, 
and spindle fibers attach at the centromeres. In anaphase II, the sister chro-
matids are pulled apart and move to opposite poles of their respective cell. 
The nuclear membranes form around the now single chromosomes (telo-
phase II). Finally, cell division takes place. At the end of the process, each of 
the four cells contains one single set of chromosomes.
Mommy, where did I come from?
From gametogenesis, honey. Meiosis in humans (and in all animals that 
reproduce sexually) produces cells called gametes. Gametes come in the form 
of sperm (produced by males) or eggs (produced by females). When condi-
tions are right, sperm and egg unite to create a new organism, which takes 
the form of a zygote. Figure 2-9 shows the process of gametogenesis (the pro-
duction of gametes) in humans.

For human males, special cells in the male’s sexual organs (testes) produce 
spermatogonia. Spermatogonia are 2n — they contain a full diploid set of 
46 chromosomes (see the earlier section “Counting out chromosome num-
bers”). After meiosis I, each single spermatogonium has divided into two cells 
called secondary spermatocytes. These spermatocytes contain only one copy 
of each homolog (as sister chromatids). After one more division (meiosis II), 
the spermatids that become sperm cells have one copy of each chromosome. 
Thus, sperm cells are haploid and contain 23 chromosomes. Because males 
have X and Y sex chromosomes, half their sperm (men produce literally mil-
lions) contain Xs and half contain Ys.
Human females produce eggs in much the same way that men produce 
sperm. Egg cells, which are produced by the ovaries, start as diploid oogonia 
(that is, 2n = 46). The big difference between egg and sperm production is 
that at the end of meiosis II, only one mature, haploid (23 chromosomes) sex 
cell (as an egg) is produced instead of four (refer to Figure 2-9). The other 
three cells produced are called polar bodies; the polar bodies aren’t actual 
egg cells and can’t be fertilized to produce offspring.
 
Why does the female body produce one egg cell and three polar bodies? Egg 
cells need large amounts of cytoplasm to nourish the zygote in the period 
between fertilization and when the mother starts providing the growing 
embryo with nutrients and energy through the placenta. The easiest way to 
get enough cytoplasm into the egg when it needs it most is to put less cyto-
plasm into the other three cells produced in meiosis II.

A
ll the physical traits of any living thing originate in that organism’s 
genes. Look at the leaves of a tree or the color of your own eyes. How 
tall are you? What color is your dog’s or cat’s fur? Can you curl or fold your 
tongue? Got hair on the backs of your fingers? All that and much more came 
from genes passed down from parent to offspring. Even if you don’t know 
much about how genes work or even what genes actually are, you’ve prob-
ably already thought about how physical traits can be inherited. Just think of 
the first thing most people say when they see a newborn baby: Who does he 
or she look most like, mommy or daddy?
The laws of inheritance — how traits are transmitted from one generation 
to the next (including dominant-recessive inheritance, segregation of alleles 
into gametes, and independent assortment of traits) — were discovered less 
than 200 years ago. In the early 1850s, Gregor Mendel, an Austrian monk with 
a love of gardening, looked at the physical world around him and, by simply 
growing peas, categorized the patterns of genetic inheritance that are still 
recognized today. In this chapter, you discover how Mendel’s peas changed 
the way scientists view the world. If you skipped Chapter 2, don’t worry — 
Mendel didn’t know anything about mitosis or meiosis when he formulated 
the laws of inheritance.
Mendel’s discoveries have an enormous impact on your life. If you’re inter-
ested in how genetics affects your health (Part III), reading this chapter and 
getting a handle on the laws of inheritance will help you.

Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Gardening with Gregor Mendel
For centuries before Mendel planted his first pea plant, scholars and scien-
tists argued about how inheritance of physical traits worked. It was obvious 
that something was passed from parent to offspring, because diseases and 
personality traits seemed to run in families. And farmers knew that by breed-
ing plants and animals with certain physical features that they valued, they 
could create varieties that produced desirable products, like higher yielding 
maize, stronger horses, or hardier dogs. But just how inheritance worked and 
exactly what was passed from parent to child remained a mystery.
Enter the star of our gardening show, Gregor Mendel. Mendel was, by nature, 
a curious person. As he wandered around the gardens of the monastery 
where he lived in the mid-19th century, he noticed that his pea plants looked 
different from one another in a number of ways. Some were tall and others 
short. Some had green seeds, and others had yellow seeds. Mendel wondered 
what caused the differences he observed and decided to conduct a series 
of simple experiments. He chose seven characteristics of pea plants for his 
experiments, as you can see in Table 3-1:

For ten years, Mendel patiently grew many varieties of peas with various flower 
colors, seed shapes, seed numbers, and so on. In a process called crossing, 
he mated parent plants to see what their offspring would look like. When he 
passed away in 1884, Mendel was unaware of the magnitude of his contribution 
to science. A full 34 years passed after publication of his work (in 1868) before 
anyone realized what this simple gardener had discovered. (For the full story 
on how Mendel’s research was lost and found again, flip to Chapter 22.)
If you don’t know much about plants, understanding how plants reproduce 
may help you appreciate what Mendel did. To mate plants, you need flowers 
and the dusty substance they produce called pollen (the plant equivalent of 
sperm). Flowers have structures called ovaries (see Figure 3-1); the ovaries 

39
 Chapter 3: Visualize Peas: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance
are hidden inside the pistil and are connected to the outside world by the 
stigma. Pollen is produced by structures called stamen. Like those of animals, 
the ovaries of plants produce eggs that, when exposed to pollen (in a process 
called pollination), are fertilized to produce seeds. Under the right condi-
tions, the seeds sprout to become plants in their own right. The plants grow-
ing from seeds are the offspring of the plant(s) that produced the eggs and 
the pollen. Fertilization can happen in one of two ways:
 
✓ Out-crossing: Two plants are crossed, and the pollen from one can be 
used to fertilize the eggs of another.
 
✓ Self-pollination (or selfing): Some flowers produce both flowers and 
pollen, in which case the flower may fertilize its own eggs. Not all plants 
can self-fertilize, but Mendel’s peas could.

Speaking the Language of Inheritance
You probably already know that genes are passed from parent to offspring 
and that somehow, genes are responsible for the physical traits (phenotype, 
such as hair color) you observe in yourself and the people and organisms 
around you. (For more on how genes do their jobs, you can flip ahead to 
Chapter 11.) The simplest possible definition of a gene is an inherited factor 
that determines some trait.
 
Genes come in different forms, called alleles. An individual’s alleles determine 
the phenotype. The combinations of alleles of all the various genes that you 
possess make up your genotype. Genes occupy loci — specific locations along 
the strands of your DNA (locus is the singular form). Different traits (like hair 
texture and hair color) are determined by genes that occupy different loci, 

40
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
often on different chromosomes (see Chapter 2 for the basics of chromo-
somes). Take a look at Figure 3-2 to see how alleles are arranged in various 
loci along two pairs of generic chromosomes.

somes.

In humans (and many other organisms), alleles of particular genes come in 
pairs. If both alleles are identical in form, that locus is said to be homozygous, 
and the whole organism can be called a homozygote for that particular locus. 
If the two alleles aren’t identical, then the individual is heterozygous, or a 
heterozygote, for that locus. Individuals can be both heterozygous and homo-
zygous at different loci at the same time, which is how all the phenotypic 
variation you see in a single organism is produced. For example, your hair 
texture is controlled by one locus, your hair color is controlled by different 
loci, and your skin color by yet other loci. You can see how figuring out how 
complex sets of traits are inherited would be pretty difficult.
Simplifying Inheritance
When it comes to sorting out inheritance, it’s easiest to start out with how 
one trait is transmitted from one generation to the next. This is the kind of 
inheritance, sometimes called simple inheritance, that Mendel started with 
when first studying his pea plants.
Mendel’s choice of pea plants and the traits he chose to focus on had posi-
tive effects on his ability to uncover the laws of inheritance.
 
✓ The original parent plants Mendel used in his experiments were true 
breeding. When true breeders are allowed to self-fertilize, the exact 
same physical traits show up, unchanged, generation after generation. 

41
 Chapter 3: Visualize Peas: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance
True-breeding tall plants always produce tall plants, true-breeding short 
plants always produce short plants, and so on.
 
✓ Mendel studied traits that had only two forms, or phenotypes, for 
each characteristic (like short or tall). He deliberately chose traits that 
were either one type or another, like tall or short, or green-seeded or 
yellow-seeded. Studying traits that come in only two forms made the 
inheritance of traits much easier to sort out. (Chapter 4 covers traits 
that have more than two phenotypes.)
 
✓ Mendel worked only on traits that showed an autosomal dominant 
form of inheritance — that is, the genes were located on autosomal 
(or non-sex) chromosomes. (I discuss more complicated forms of inheri-
tance in Chapters 4 and 5.)
Before his pea plants began producing pollen, Mendel opened the flower buds. 
He cut off either the pollen-producing part (the stamen) or the pollen-receiving 
part (the stigma) to prevent the plant from self-fertilizing. After the flower 
matured, he transferred pollen by hand — okay, not technically his hand; he 
used a tiny brush — from one plant (the “father”) to another (the “mother”). 
Mendel then planted the seeds (the offspring) that resulted from this “mating” 
to see which physical traits each cross produced. The following sections explain 
the three laws of inheritance that Mendel discovered from his experiments.
Establishing dominance
For his experiments, Mendel crossed true-breeding plants that produced 
round seeds with true breeders that produced wrinkled seeds, crossed short 
true-breeders with tall true-breeders, and so on. Crosses of parent organ-
isms that differ by only one trait, like seed shape or plant height, are called 
monohybrid crosses. Mendel patiently moved pollen from plant to plant, har-
vested and planted seeds, and observed the results after the offspring plants 
matured. His plants produced literally thousands of seeds, so his garden 
must have been quite a sight.
To describe Mendel’s experiments and results, I refer to the parental gen-
eration with the letter P. I refer to the first offspring from a cross as F1. If F1 
offspring are mated to each other (or allowed to self-fertilize), I call the next 
generation F2 (see Figure 3-3 for the generation breakdown).
 
The results of Mendel’s experiments were amazingly consistent. In every case 
when he mated true breeders of different phenotypes, all the F1 offspring had 
the same phenotype as one or the other parent plant. For example, when 
Mendel crossed a true-breeding tall parent with a true-breeding short parent, 
all the F1 offspring were tall. This result was surprising because until then, 
many people thought inheritance was a blending of the characteristics of the 
two parents — Mendel had expected his first generation offspring to be 
medium height.

Self-fertilization
If Mendel had just scratched his head and stopped there, he wouldn’t have 
learned much. But he allowed the F1 offspring to self-fertilize, and something 
interesting happened: About 25 percent of the F2 offspring were short, and 
the rest, about 75 percent, were tall (refer to Figure 3-3).
From that F2 generation, when allowed to self-fertilize, his short plants were 
true breeders — all produced short progeny. His F2 tall plants produced both 
tall and short offspring. About one-third of his tall F2s bred true as tall. The 
rest produced tall and short offspring in a 3:1 ratio (that is, 3⁄4 tall and 1⁄4 short; 
refer to Figure 3-3).
After thousands of crosses, Mendel came to the accurate conclusion that the 
factors that determine seed shape, seed color, pod color, plant height, and so 
on are acting sets of two. He reached this understanding because one pheno-
type showed up in the F1 offspring, but both phenotypes were present among 
the F2 plants. The result in the F2 generation told him that whatever it was 
that controlled a particular trait (such as plant height) had been present but 
somehow hidden in the F1 offspring.
 
Mendel quickly figured out that certain traits seem to act like rulers, or domi-
nate, other traits. Dominance means that one factor masks the presence of 
another. Round seed shape dominated wrinkled. Tall height dominated short. 
Yellow seed color dominated green. Mendel rightly determined the genetic 
principle of dominance by strictly observing phenotype in generation after 
generation and cross after cross. When true tall and short plants were 
crossed, each F1 offspring got one height-determining factor from each parent. 

43
 Chapter 3: Visualize Peas: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance
Because tall is dominant over short, all the F1 plants were tall. Mendel found 
that the only time recessive characters (traits that are masked by dominant 
traits) were expressed was when the two factors were alike, as when short 
plants self-fertilized.
Segregating alleles
Segregation is when things get separated from each other. In the genetic 
sense, what’s separated are the two factors — the alleles of the gene — that 
determine phenotype. Figure 3-4 traces the segregation of the alleles for seed 
color through three generations. The shorthand for describing alleles is typi-
cally a capital letter for the dominant trait and the same letter in lowercase 
for the recessive trait. In this example, I use Y for the dominant allele that 
makes yellow seeds; y stands for the recessive allele that, when homozygous, 
makes seeds green.
 
The letters or symbols you use for various alleles and traits are arbitrary. Just 
make sure you’re consistent in how you use letters and symbols, and don’t get 
them mixed up.
In the segregation example featured in Figure 3-4, the parents (in the P genera-
tion) are homozygous. Each individual parent plant has a certain genotype — 
a combination of alleles — that determines its phenotype. Because pea plants 
are diploid (meaning they have two copies of each gene; see Chapter 2), 
the genotype of each plant is described using two letters. For example, a 
true-breeding yellow-seeded plant would have the genotype YY, and green-
seeded plants are yy. The gametes (sex cells, as in pollen or eggs) produced 
by each plant bear only one allele. (Sex cells are haploid; see Chapter 2 for all 
the details on how meiosis produces haploid gametes.) Therefore, the true 
breeders can produce gametes of only one type — YY plants can only make Y 
gametes and yy plants can only produce y gametes. When a Y pollen and a y 
egg (or visa versa, y pollen and Y egg) get together, they make a Yy offspring — 
this is the heterozygous F1 generation.
 
The bottom line of the principle of segregation is this parsing out of the pairs 
of alleles into gametes. Each gamete gets one and only one allele for each 
locus; this is the result of homologous chromosomes parting company during 
the first round of meiosis (see Chapter 2 for more on how chromosomes split 
during meiosis). When the F1 generation self-fertilizes (to create the F2 genera-
tion), each plant produces two kinds of gametes: Half are Y, and the other half 
are y. Segregation makes four combinations of zygotes possible: YY, Yy, yY, or 
yy. (Yy and yY look redundant, but they’re genetically significant because they 
represent different contributions [y or Y] from each parent.) Phenotypically, 
Yy, yY, and YY all look alike: yellow seeds. Only yy makes green seeds. The 
ratio of genotypes is 1:2:1 (¼ homozygous dominant: ½ heterozygous: ¼ 
homozygous recessive), and the ratio of phenotypes is 3 to 1 (dominant phe-
notype to recessive phenotype).

If allowed to self-fertilize in the F3 generation, yy parents make yy offspring, 
and YY parents produce only YY offspring. The Yy parents again make YY, Yy, 
and yy offspring in the same ratios observed in the F2: 1⁄4 YY, 1⁄2 Yy, and 1⁄4 yy.
Scientists now know that what Mendel saw acting in sets of two were genes. 
Single pairs of genes (that is, one locus) control each trait. That means that 
plant height is at one locus, seed color at a different locus, seed shape at a 
third locus, and so on.
Declaring independence
As Mendel learned more about how traits were passed from one generation 
to the next, he carried out experiments with plants that differed in two or 
more traits. He discovered that the traits behaved independently — that is, 
that the inheritance of plant height had no effect on the inheritance of seed 
color, for example.

45
 Chapter 3: Visualize Peas: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance
 
The independent inheritance of traits is called the law of independent assort-
ment and is a consequence of meiosis. When homologous pairs of chromo-
somes separate, they do so randomly with respect to each other. The 
movement of each individual chromosome is independent with respect to 
every other chromosome. It’s just like flipping a coin: As long as the coin isn’t 
rigged, one coin flip has no effect on another — each flip is an independent 
event. Genetically, what this random separation amounts to is that alleles on 
different chromosomes are inherited independently.
Segregation and independent assortment are closely related principles. 
Segregation tells you that alleles at the same locus on pairs of chromosomes 
separate and that each offspring has the same chance of inheriting a particu-
lar allele from a parent. Independent assortment means that every offspring 
also has the same opportunity to inherit any allele at any other locus (but 
this rule has some exceptions; see Chapter 4).
Finding Unknown Alleles
Mendel crossed parent plants in many different combinations to work out the 
identity of the hidden factors (which we now know as genes) that produced 
the phenotypes he observed. One type of cross was especially informative. 
A testcross is when any individual with an unknown genotype is crossed with 
a true-breeding individual with the recessive phenotype (in other words, a 
homozygote).
Each cross provides different information about the genotypes of the individ-
uals involved. For example, Mendel could take any plant with any phenotype 
and testcross it with a true-breeding recessive plant to find out which alleles 
the plant of unknown genotype carried. Here’s how the testcross would work: 
A plant with the dominant phenotype, violet flowers, could be crossed with 
a true-breeding white flowered plant (ww). If the resulting offspring all had 
violet flowers, Mendel knew that the unknown genotype was homozygous 
dominant (WW). In Figure 3-5, you see the results of another testcross: A 
heterozygote (Ww) testcross yielded offspring of half white and half violet 
phenotypes.

Applying Basic Probability to 
the Likelihood of Inheritance
 
Predicting the results of crosses is easy, because the rules of probability 
govern the likelihood of getting particular outcomes. The following are two 
important rules of probability that you should know:
 
✓ Multiplication rule: Used when the probabilities of events are indepen-
dent of each other — that is, the result of one event doesn’t influence 
the result of another. The combined probability of both events occur-
ring is the product of the events, so you multiply the probabilities.
 
✓ Addition rule: Used when you want to know the probability of one 
event occurring as opposed to another, independent, event. Put another 
way, you use this rule when you want to know the probability of one or 
another event happening, but not necessarily both.
For more details about the laws of probability, check out the sidebar “Beating 
the odds with genetics.”
Here’s how you apply the addition and multiplication rules for monohybrid 
crosses (crosses of parent organisms that differ only by one trait). Suppose 
you have two pea plants. Both plants have violet flowers, and both are het-
erozygous (Ww). Each plant will produce two sorts of gametes, W and w, with 
equal probability — that is, half of the gametes will be W and half will be w 
for each plant. To determine the probability of a certain genotype resulting 
from the cross of these two plants, you use the multiplication rule and mul-
tiply probabilities. For example, what’s the probability of getting a heterozy-
gote (Ww) from this cross?
Because both plants are heterozygous (Ww), the probability of getting a W 
from plant one is 1⁄2, and the probability of getting a w from plant two is also 1⁄2. 
The word and tells you that you need to multiply the two probabilities to 
determine the probability of the two events happening together. So, 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4. 
But there’s another way to get a heterozygote from this cross: Plant one could 
contribute the w, and plant two could contribute the W. The probability of this 
turn of events is exactly equal to the first scenario: 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4. Thus, you have 
two equally probable ways of getting a heterozygote: wW or Ww. The word 
or tells you that you must add the two probabilities together to get the total 
probability of getting a heterozygote: 1⁄4 + 1⁄4 = 1⁄2. Put another way, there’s a 50 
percent probability of getting heterozygote offspring when two heterozygotes 
are crossed.

Solving Simple Genetics Problems
Every genetics problem, from those on an exam to one that determines what 
coat color your dog’s puppies may have, can be solved in the same manner. 
Here’s a simple approach to any genetics problem:
 
1. Determine how many traits you’re dealing with.
 
2. Count the number of phenotypes.
 
3. Carefully read the problem to identify the question. Do you need to 
calculate genetic or phenotypic ratios? Are you trying to determine 
something about the parents or the offspring?
 
4. Look for words that mean and and or to help determine which prob-
abilities to add and which to multiply.
Beating the odds with genetics
When you try to predict the outcome of a cer-
tain event, like a coin flip or the gender of an 
unborn child, you’re using probability. For many 
events, the probability is either-or. For instance, 
a baby can be either male or female, and a coin 
can land either heads or tails. Both outcomes 
are considered equally likely (as long as the 
coin isn’t rigged somehow). For many events, 
however, determining the likelihood of a certain 
outcome is more complicated. Deciding how to 
calculate the odds depends on what you want 
to know.
Take, for example, predicting the sex of several 
children born to a given couple. The probability 
of any baby being a boy is 1⁄2, or 50 percent. If the 
first baby is a boy, the probability of the second 
child being a boy is still 50 percent, because the 
events that determine sex are independent from 
one child to the next (see Chapter 2 for a run-
down of how meiosis works to produce gam-
etes for sex cells). That means the sex of one 
child has no effect on the sex of the next child. 
But if you want to know the probability of having 
two boys in a row, you multiply the probability 
of each independent event together: 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4, 
or 25 percent. If you want to know the probabil-
ity of having two boys or two girls, you add the 
probabilities of the events together: 1⁄4 (the prob-
ability of having two boys) + 1⁄4 (the probability of 
having two girls) = 1⁄2, or 50 percent.
Genetic counselors use probability to deter-
mine the likelihood that someone has inherited 
a given trait and the likelihood that a person will 
pass on a trait if he or she has it. For example, a 
man and woman are each carriers for a reces-
sive disorder, such as cystic fibrosis. The coun-
selor can predict the likelihood that the couple 
will have an affected child. Just as in Mendel’s 
flower crosses, each parent can produce 
two kinds of gametes, affected or unaffected. 
The man produces half-affected and half-
unaffected gametes, as does the woman. The 
probability that any child inherits an affected 
allele from the mom and an affected allele from 
the dad is 1⁄4 (that’s 1⁄2 × 1⁄2). The probability that a 
child will be affected and female is 1⁄8 (that’s 1⁄4 × 
1⁄2). The probability that a child will be affected 
or a boy is 3⁄4 (that’s 1⁄4 + 1⁄2).

Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Deciphering a monohybrid cross
Imagine that you have your own garden full of the same variety of peas that 
Mendel studied. After reading this book, filled with enthusiasm for genetics, 
you rush out to examine your pea plants, having noticed that some plants 
are tall and others short. You know that last year you had one tall plant 
(which self-fertilized) and that this year’s crop consists of the offspring of 
last year’s one tall parent plant. After counting plants, you discover that 77 of 
your plants are tall, and 26 are short. What was the genotype of your original 
plant? What is the dominant allele?
You have two distinct phenotypes (tall and short) of one trait — plant height. 
You can choose any symbol or letter you please, but often, geneticists use a 
letter like t for short and then capitalize that letter for the other allele (here, 
T for tall).
One way to start solving the problem of short versus tall plants is to deter-
mine the ratio of one phenotype to the other. To calculate the ratios, add 
the number of offspring together: 77 + 26 = 103, and divide to determine the 
proportion of each phenotype: 77 ÷ 103 = 0.75, or 75 percent are tall. To verify 
your result, you can divide 26 by 103 to see that 25 percent of the offspring are 
short, and 75 percent plus 25 percent gives you 100 percent of your plants.
From this information alone, you’ve probably already realized (thanks to 
simple probability) that your original plant must have been heterozygous 
and that tall is dominant over short. As I explain in the “Segregating alleles” 
section earlier in this chapter, a heterozygous plant (Tt) produces two kinds 
of gametes (T or t) with equal probability (that is, half the time the gametes 
are T and the other half they’re t). The probability of getting a homozygous 
dominant (TT) genotype is 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4 (that’s the probability of getting T twice: 
T once and T a second time, like two coin flips in a row landing heads). The 
probability of getting a heterozygous dominant (T and t, or t and T) is 1⁄2 × 
1⁄2 = 1⁄4 (to get Tt) plus 1⁄2 × 1⁄2 = 1⁄4 (tT). The total probability of a plant with the 
dominant phenotype (TT or Tt or tT) is 1⁄4 + 1⁄4 + 1⁄4 = 3⁄4. With 103 plants, you’d 
expect 77.25 (on average) of them to show the dominant phenotype — which 
is essentially what you observed.
Tackling a dihybrid cross
To become more comfortable with the process of solving simple genetics 
problems, you can tackle a problem that involves more than one trait: a dihy-
brid cross.
Here’s the problem scenario. In bunnies, short hair is dominant. (If you’re a 
rabbit breeder, please forgive my oversimplification.) Your roommate moves 
out and leaves behind two bunnies (you were feeding them anyway, and 

49
 Chapter 3: Visualize Peas: Discovering the Laws of Inheritance
they’re cute, so you don’t mind). One morning you wake to find that your 
bunnies are now parents to a litter of babies.
 
✓ One is gray and has long fur.
 
✓ Two are black and have long fur.
 
✓ Two are gray and have short fur.
 
✓ Seven look just like the parents: black with short fur.
Besides the meaningful lesson about spaying and neutering pets, what can 
you discover about the genetics of coat color and hair length of your rabbits?
First, how many traits are you dealing with? I haven’t told you anything about 
the gender of your baby bunnies, so it’s safe to assume that sex doesn’t have 
anything to do with the problem. (I take that back. Sex is the source of the 
problem — see Chapter 5 for more on the genetics of sex.) You’re dealing 
with two traits: color of fur and length of fur. Each trait has two phenotypes: 
Fur can be black or gray, and length of fur can be long or short. In working 
through this problem, you’re told upfront that short fur is a dominant trait, 
but you don’t get any information about color.
The simplest method is to examine one trait at a time — in other words, look 
at the monohybrid crosses. (Jump back to the section “Deciphering a mono-
hybrid cross” for a refresher.)
Both parents have short fur. How many of their offspring have short fur? Nine 
of twelve, and 9 ÷ 12 = 3⁄4, or 75 percent. That means there are three short-
haired bunnies to every one long-haired bunny.
Being identical in phenotype, the parents both have black coats. How many 
babies have black coats? Nine of twelve. There’s that comfortingly familiar 
ratio again! The ratio of black to gray is 3 to 1.
From your knowledge of monohybrid crosses, you’ve probably guessed that 
the parent rabbits are heterozygous for coat color and, at the same time, are 
heterozygous for fur length. To be sure, you can calculate the probability of 
certain genotypes and corresponding phenotypes of offspring for two rabbits 
that are heterozygous at two loci (see Figure 3-6).
The phenotypic ratio observed in the rabbits’ offspring (9:3:3:1; refer to Figure 
3-6) is typical for the F2 generation in a dihybrid cross. The rarest phenotype is 
the one that’s recessive for both traits; in this case, long hair and gray color are 
both recessive. The most common phenotype is the one that’s dominant for 
both traits. The fact that seven of your twelve baby rabbits are black with short 
fur tells you that the probability of getting a particular allele for color and a 
particular allele for coat length is the product of two independent events. Coat 
color and hair length are coded by genes that are inherited independently — 
as you would expect under the principle of independent assortment.

Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws 
Applied to Complex Traits
In This Chapter
▶ Examining the variations of dominant alleles
▶ Reviewing how simple inheritance becomes more complicated
▶ Looking at some exceptions to Mendel’s laws
A
lthough nearly 150 years have elapsed since Gregor Mendel cultivated 
his pea plants (see Chapter 3), the observations he made and the con-
clusions he drew still accurately describe how genes are passed from parent 
to offspring. The basic laws of inheritance — dominance, segregation, and 
independent assortment — continue to stand the test of time.
However, inheritance isn’t nearly as simple as Mendel’s experiments suggest. 
Dominant alleles don’t always dominate, and genes aren’t always inherited 
independently. Some genes mask their appearances, and some alleles can 
kill. This chapter explains exactly how Mendel was right, and wrong, about 
the laws of inheritance and how they’re enforced.
Dominant Alleles Rule . . . Sometimes
If Mendel had chosen a plant other than the pea plant for his experiments, he 
may have come to some very different conclusions. The traits that Mendel 
studied show simple dominance — when the dominant allele’s phenotype, or 
physical trait (a yellow seed, for example), masks the presence of the reces-
sive allele. The recessive phenotype (a green seed in this example) is only 
expressed when both alleles are recessive, which is written as yy. (Turn to 
Chapter 3 for the definitions of commonly used genetics terms such as allele, 
recessive, and homozygote.) But not all alleles behave neatly as dominant-
recessive. Some alleles show incomplete dominance and therefore seem to 
display a blend of phenotypes from the parents. This section tells you how 
dominant alleles rule the roost — but only part of the time.

52
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Wimping out with incomplete dominance
A trip to the grocery store can be a nice genetics lesson. Take eggplant, for 
example. Eggplant comes in various shades of (mostly) purple skin that are 
courtesy of a pair of alleles at a single locus interacting in different ways to 
express the phenotype — purple fruit color. Dark purple and white colors 
are both the result of homozygous alleles. Dark purple is homozygous for the 
dominant allele (PP), and white is homozygous for the recessive allele (pp). 
When crossed, dark purple and white eggplants yield light purple offspring — 
the intermediate phenotype. This intermediate color is the result of the allele 
for purple being incomplete in its dominance of the allele for white (which is 
actually the allele for no color).
 
With incomplete dominance, the alleles are inherited in exactly the same way 
they always are: One allele comes from each parent. The alleles still conform 
to the principles of segregation and independent assortment, but the way 
those alleles are expressed (the phenotype) is different. (You can find out 
about exceptions to the independent assortment rules in the section “Genes 
linked together” later in this chapter.)
Here’s how the eggplant cross works: The parent plants are PP (for purple) 
and pp (for white). The F1 generation is all heterozygous (Pp), just as you’d 
expect from Mendel’s experiments (see Chapter 3). If this were a case of 
simple dominance, all the Pp F1 generation would be dark purple. But in this 
case of incomplete dominance, the F1 generation comes out light purple 
(sometimes called violet). (The heterozygotes produce a less purple pigment, 
making the offspring lighter in color than homozygous purple plants.)
In the F2 (the result of crossing Pp with Pp), half the offspring have violet 
fruits (corresponding with the Pp genotype). One-quarter of the offspring are 
dark purple (PP) and one-quarter are white (pp) — these are the homozy-
gous offspring. Rather than the 3:1 phenotypic ratio (three dark purple egg-
plants and one white eggplant) you’d expect to see with simple dominance, 
with incomplete dominance, you see a 1:2:1 ratio (one dark purple eggplant, 
two light purple eggplants, and one white eggplant) — the exact ratio of the 
underlying genotype (PP, Pp, Pp, pp).
Keeping it fair with codominance
 
When alleles share equally in the expression of their phenotypes, the inheri-
tance pattern is considered codominant. Both alleles are expressed fully as 
phenotypes instead of experiencing some intermediate expression (like what’s 
observed in incomplete dominance).

53
 Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits
You can see a good example of codominance in human blood types. If you’ve 
ever donated blood (or received a transfusion), you know that your blood 
type is extremely important. If you receive the wrong blood type during a 
transfusion, you can have a fatal allergic reaction. Blood types are the result 
of proteins, called antigens, that your body produces on the surface of red 
blood cells. Antigens protect you from disease by recognizing invading cells 
(like bacteria) as foreign, and then binding to the cells and destroying them.
Your antigens determine your blood type. Several alleles code for blood 
antigens. Dominant alleles code two familiar blood types, A and B. When a 
person has both A and B alleles, the person’s blood produces both antigens 
simultaneously and in equal amounts. Therefore, a person who has an AB 
genotype also has the AB phenotype.
The situation with ABO blood types gets more complicated by the presence 
of a third allele for type O in some people. The O allele is recessive, so ABO 
blood types show two sorts of inheritance:
 
✓ Codominance (for A and B)
 
✓ Dominant-recessive (A or B paired with the O allele)
Type O is only expressed in the homozygous state. For more information on 
multiple alleles, check out the section “More than two alleles” later in this 
chapter.
Dawdling with incomplete penetrance
 
Some dominant alleles don’t express their influence consistently. When domi-
nant alleles are present but fail to show up as a phenotype, the condition is 
termed incompletely penetrant. Penetrance is the probability that an individual 
having a dominant allele will show the associated phenotype. Complete pene-
trance means every person having the allele shows the phenotype. Most domi-
nant alleles have 100 percent penetrance — that is, the phenotype is 
expressed in every individual possessing the allele. However, other alleles 
may show reduced, or incomplete, penetrance, meaning that individuals car-
rying the allele have a reduced probability of having the trait.
Penetrance of disease-causing alleles like those responsible for certain can-
cers or other hereditary disorders complicate matters in genetic testing (see 
Chapter 12 to find out more about genetic testing for disease). For example, one 
of the genes associated with breast cancer (BRCA1) is incompletely penetrant. 
Studies estimate that approximately 70 percent of women carrying the allele 
will be affected by breast cancer by age 70. Therefore, genetic tests indicating 
that someone carries the allele only point to increased risk, not a certainty of 
getting the disease, and indicate a need for affected women to be screened 
regularly for early signs of the disease, when treatment can be most effective.

54
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
 
Geneticists usually talk about penetrance in terms of a percentage. In this 
example, the breast cancer gene is 70 percent penetrant.
Regardless of penetrance, the degree to which an allele expresses the phe-
notype may differ from individual to individual; this variable strength of a 
trait is called expressivity. One trait with variable expressivity that shows up 
in humans is polydactyly, the condition of having more than ten fingers or 
toes. In persons with polydactyly, the expressivity of the trait is measured by 
the completeness of the extra digits — some people have tiny skin tags, and 
others have fully functional extra fingers or toes.
Alleles Causing Complications
The variety of forms that genes (as alleles) take accounts for the enormous 
diversity of physical traits you see in the world around you. For example, 
many alleles exist for eye color and hair color. In addition, several loci con-
tribute to most phenotypes. Dealing with multiple loci and many alleles 
at each locus complicates inheritance patterns and makes them harder to 
understand. For many disorders, scientists don’t fully understand the form of 
inheritance because variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance mask 
the patterns. Additionally, multiple alleles can interact as incompletely domi-
nant, codominant, or dominant-recessive (see “Dominant Alleles Rule . . . 
Sometimes” earlier in this chapter for the whole story). This section explains 
how various alleles of a single gene can complicate inheritance patterns.
More than two alleles
When it came to his pea plant research, Mendel deliberately chose to study 
traits that came in only two flavors. For instance, his peas had only two 
flower color possibilities: white and purple. The allele for purple in the 
common pea plant is fully dominant, so it shows up as the same shade of 
purple in both heterozygous and homozygous plants. In addition to being 
fully dominant, purple is completely penetrant, so every single plant that 
inherits the gene for purple flowers has purple flowers.
If Mendel had been a rabbit breeder instead of a gardener, his would likely 
be a different story. He may not have earned the title “Father of Genetics,” 
because the broad spectrum of rabbit coat colors would make most anyone 
simply throw up his hands.
To simplify matters, consider one gene for coat color in bunnies. The C gene 
has four alleles that control the amount of pigment produced in the hair 
shaft. These four alleles give you four rabbit color patterns to work with. The 
various rabbit color alleles are designated by the letter c with superscripts:

55
 Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits
 
✓ Brown (c+): Brown rabbits are considered wild-type, which is generally 
considered the “normal” phenotype. Brown rabbits are brown all over.
 
✓ Albino (c): Rabbits homozygous for this color allele don’t produce any 
pigment at all. Therefore, these white rabbits are considered albino. 
They have all-white coats, pink eyes, and pink skin.
 
✓ Chinchilla (cch): Chinchilla rabbits are solid gray (specifically, they have 
white hair with black tips).
 
✓ Himalayan (ch): Himalayan rabbits are white but have dark hair on their 
feet, ears, and noses.
 
Wild-type is a bit of a problematic term in genetics. Generally, wild-type is con-
sidered the “normal” phenotype, and everything else is “mutant.” Mutant is 
simply different, an alternative form that’s not necessarily harmful. Wild-type 
tends to be the most common phenotype and is usually dominant over other 
alleles. You’re bound to see wild-type used in genetics books to describe phe-
notypes such as eye color in fruit flies. Though rare, the mutant color forms 
occur in natural populations of animals. In the case of domestic rabbits, color 
forms other than brown are the product of breeding programs specifically 
designed to obtain certain coat colors.
 
Although a particular trait can be determined by a number of different alleles 
(as in the four allele possibilities for rabbit coat color), any particular animal 
carries only two alleles at a particular locus at one time.
The C gene in rabbits exhibits a dominance hierarchy common among 
genes with multiple alleles. Wild-type is completely dominant over the other 
three alleles, so any rabbit having the c+ allele will be brown. Chinchilla is 
incompletely dominant over Himalayan and albino. That means heterozy-
gous chinchilla/Himalayan rabbits are gray with dark ears, noses, and tails. 
Heterozygous chinchilla/albinos are lighter than homozygous chinchillas. 
Albino is only expressed in animals that are homozygous (cc).
The color alleles in monohybrid crosses for rabbit color follow the same 
rules of segregation and independent assortment that apply to the pea plants 
that Mendel studied (see Chapter 3). The phenotypes for rabbit color are just 
more complex. For example, if you were to cross an albino rabbit (cc) with 
a homozygous chinchilla (cchcch), in the F2 generation (ccch mated with ccch) 
you’d get the expected 1:2:1 genotypic ratio (1 cc to 2 ccch to 1 cchcch); the 
phenotypes would show a correspondi ng 1:2:1 ratio (one albino, two light 
chinchilla, one full chinchilla).
 
A total of five genes actually control coat color in rabbits. The section “Genes 
in hiding” later in this chapter delves into how multiple genes interact to 
create fur color.

56
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Lethal alleles
 
Many alleles express unwanted traits (phenotypes) that indirectly cause suf-
fering and death (such as the excessive production of mucus in the lungs of 
cystic fibrosis patients). Rarely, alleles may express the lethal phenotype — 
that is, death — immediately and thus are never expressed beyond the zygote. 
These alleles produce a 1:2 phenotypic ratio, because only heterozygotes and 
homozygous nonlethals survive to be counted.
The first lethal allele that scientists described was associated with yellow 
coat color in mice. Yellow mice are always heterozygous. When yellow mice 
are bred to other yellow mice, they produce yellow and non-yellow off-
spring in a 2:1 ratio, because all homozygous yellow mice die as embryos. 
Homozygous yellow has no real phenotype (beyond dead), because these 
animals never survive.
Lethal alleles are almost always recessive, and thus are expressed only in 
homozygotes. One notable exception is the gene that causes Huntington 
disease. Huntington disease (also known as Huntington chorea) is inher-
ited as an autosomal dominant lethal disorder, meaning that persons with 
Huntington disease develop a progressive nerve disorder that causes invol-
untary muscle movement and loss of mental function. Huntington disease is 
expressed in adulthood and is always fatal. It has no cure; treatment is aimed 
at alleviating symptoms of the disease.
Making Life More Complicated
Many phenotypes are determined by the action of more than one gene at a 
time. Genes can hide the effects of each other, and sometimes one gene can 
control several phenotypes at once. This section looks at how genes make 
life more complicated (and more interesting).
When genes interact
If you don’t mind returning to the produce section of your local grocery store 
(no more eggplants, I promise), you can observe the interaction of multiple 
genes to produce various colors of bell peppers. Two genes (R and C) inter-
act to make these mild, sweet peppers appear red, brown, yellow, or green. 
You see four phenotypes as the result of two alleles at each locus.

57
 Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits
Figure 4-1 shows the genetic breakdown of bell peppers. In the parental gen-
eration (P), you start with a homozygous dominant pepper (RRCC), which 
is red, crossed with a homozygous recessive (rrcc) green pepper. (This is a 
dihybrid cross — that is, one involving two genes — like the one I describe 
at the end of Chapter 3.) You can easily determine the expected genotypic 
ratios by considering each locus separately. For the F1 generation, that’s 
really easy to do, because both loci are heterozygous (RrCc). Just like homo-
zygous dominant peppers, fully heterozygous peppers are red. When the F1 
peppers self-fertilize, the phenotypes of brown and yellow show up.
Brown pepper color is produced by the genotype R_cc. The blank means 
that the R locus must have at least one dominant allele present to produce 
color, but the other allele can be either dominant or recessive. Yellow is pro-
duced by the combination rrC_. To make yellow pigment, the C allele must 
be either heterozygous dominant or homozygous dominant with a recessive 
homozygous R allele. The F2 generation shows the familiar 9:3:3:1 dihybrid 
phenotypic ratio (just like the guinea pigs do in Chapter 3). The loci assort 
independently, just as you’d expect them to.

Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Genes in hiding
As the preceding section explains, in pepper color, the alleles of two genes 
interact to produce color. But sometimes, genes hide or mask the action of 
other genes altogether. This occurrence is called epistasis.
A good example of epistasis is the way in which color is determined in 
horses. Like that of dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans, hair color in horses 
is determined by numerous genes. At least seven loci determine color in 
horses. To simplify mastering epistasis, you tackle the actions of only three 
genes: W, E, and A (see Table 4-1 for a rundown of the genes and their 
effects). One locus (W) determines the presence or absence of color. Two 
loci (E and A) interact to determine the distribution of red and black hair — 
the most common hair colors in horses.
A horse that carries one dominant allele for W will be albino — no color 
pigments are produced, and the animal has white skin, white hair, and pink 
eyes. (Homozygous dominant for the white allele is lethal; therefore, no living 
horse possesses the WW genotype.) All horses that are some color other 
than white are homozygous recessive (ww). (If you’re a horse breeder, you 
know that I’m really oversimplifying here. Please forgive me.) Therefore, the 
dominant allele W shows dominant epistasis because it masks the presence of 
other alleles that determine color.
If a horse isn’t white (that is, not albino), then two main genes are likely 
determining its hair color: E and A. When the dominant allele E is present, the 
horse has black hair (it may not be black all over, but it’s black somewhere). 
Black hair is expressed because the E locus controls the production of two 
pigments, red and black. EE and Ee horses produce both black and red pig-
ments. Homozygous recessive (ee) horses are red; in fact, they’re always red 
regardless of what’s happening at the A locus. Thus, ee is recessive epistatic, 
which means that in the homozygous recessive individual, the locus masks 
the action of other loci. In this case, the production of black pigment is com-
pletely blocked.
When a horse has at least one dominant allele at the E locus, the A locus con-
trols the amount of black produced. The A locus (also called agouti, which is 
a dark brown color) controls the production of black pigments. A horse with 
the dominant A allele produces black only on certain parts of its body (often 
on its mane, tail, and legs — a pattern referred to as bay). Horses that are aa 
are simply black. However, the homozygous recessive E locus (ee) masks the 
A locus entirely (regardless of genotype), blocking black color completely.

This example of the genetics of horse hair color proves that the actions of 
genes can be complex. In this one example, you see a lethal allele (W) along 
with two other loci that can each mask the other under the right combination 
of alleles. This potential explains why it can be so difficult to determine how 
certain conditions are inherited. Epistasis can act along with reduced pen-
etrance to create extremely elusive patterns of inheritance — patterns that 
often can only be worked out by examining the DNA itself. (I cover genetic

Genes linked together
Roughly 30 years after Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900 and verified 
by the scientific community (see Chapter 22 for the whole story), the British 
geneticist Ronald A. Fisher realized that Mendel had been exceptionally 
lucky — either that or he’d cheated. Of the many, many traits Mendel could 
have studied, he published his results on seven traits that conform to the 
laws of segregation and independent assortment, have two alleles, and show 
dominant-recessive inheritance patterns. Fisher asserted that Mendel must 
have published the part of his data he understood and left out the rest. (After 
Mendel died, all his papers were burned, so we’ll never know the truth.) The 
rest would include all the parts that make inheritance messy, like epistasis 
and linkage.
 
Because of the way genes are situated along chromosomes, genes that are 
very close together spatially (that is, fewer than 50 million base pairs apart; 
see Chapter 6 for how DNA is measured in base pairs) are inherited together. 
When genes are so close together that they’re inherited together (either all or 
part of the time), the genes are said to be linked (see Figure 4-2). The occur-
rence of linked genes means that not all genes are subject to independent 
assortment. To determine if genes are linked, geneticists carry out a process 
called linkage analysis.

The process of linkage analysis is really a determination of how often recombina-
tion (the mixing of information, also called crossing-over, contained on the two 
homologous chromosomes; see Chapter 2) occurs between two or more genes. 
If genes are close enough together on the chromosome, they end up being 
linked more than 50 percent of the time. However, genes on the same chromo-
some can behave as if they were on different chromosomes, because during 
the first stage of meiosis (see Chapter 2), crossing-over occurs at many points 
along the two homologous chromosomes. If crossing-over splits two loci up 
more than 50 percent of the time, the genes on the same chromosome appear to 
assort independently, as if the genes were on different chromosomes altogether.
Generally, geneticists perform linkage analysis by examining dihybrid crosses 
(dihybrid means two loci; see Chapter 3) between a heterozygote and a 
homozygote. If you want to determine the linkage between two traits in fruit 
flies, for example, you choose an individual that’s AaBb and cross it with one 
that’s aabb. If the two loci, A and B, are assorting independently, you can 
expect to see the results shown in Figure 4-3. The heterozygous parent pro-
duces four types of gametes — AB, aB, Ab, and ab — with equal frequency. 
The homozygous parent can only make one sort of gamete — ab. Thus, in the 
F1 offspring, you see a 1:1:1:1 ratio.
But what if you see a completely unexpected ratio, like the one shown in Table 
4-2? What does that mean? These results indicate that the traits are linked.
As you can see in Figure 4-4, the dihybrid parent makes four sorts of gametes. 
Even though the loci are on the same chromosome, the gametes don’t occur 
in equal frequency. Most of the gametes show up just as they do on the chro-
mosome, but crossover occurs between the two loci roughly 20 percent of 
the time, producing the two rarer sorts of gametes (each is produced about 
10 percent of the time). Crossover occurs with roughly the same frequency in 

61
 Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits
the homozygous parent, too, but because the alleles are the same, the results 
of those crossover events are invisible. Therefore, you can safely ignore that 
part of the problem.

To calculate map distance, or the amount of crossover, between two loci, you 
divide the total number of recombinant offspring by the total number of off-
spring observed. The recombinant offspring are the ones that have a genotype 
different from the parental genotype. This calculation gives you a proportion: 
percent recombination. One map unit distance on a chromosome is equal to 1 
percent recombination. Generally, one map unit is considered to be 1 million 
base pairs long.
 
As it turns out, genes for four of the traits Mendel studied were situated 
together on chromosomes. Two genes were on chromosome 1, and two were on 
chromosome 4; however, the genes were far enough apart that recombination 
was greater than 50 percent. Thus, all four traits appeared to assort indepen-
dently, just as they would have if they’d been on four different chromosomes.
One gene with many phenotypes
Certain genes can control more than one phenotype. Genes that control 
multiple phenotypes are pleiotropic. Pleiotropy is very common; almost any 
major single gene disorder listed in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man 
database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim) shows pleiotropic effects.
Take, for example, phenylketonuria (PKU). This disease is inherited as a 
single gene defect and is autosomal recessive. When persons with the homo-
zygous recessive phenotype consume substances containing phenylalanine, 
their bodies lack the proper biochemical pathway to break down the phenyl-
alanine into tyrosine. As a result, phenylalanine accumulates in the body, pre-
venting normal brain development. The primary phenotype of persons with 
PKU is mental retardation, but the impaired biochemical pathway affects 
other phenotypic traits as well. Thus, PKU patients also exhibit light hair 
color, unusual patterns of walking and sitting, skin problems, and seizures. 
All the phenotypic traits associated with PKU are associated with the single 
gene defect rather than the actions of more than one gene (see Chapter 12 for 
more details about PKU).

 Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits
Uncovering More Exceptions 
to Mendel’s Laws
As inheritance of genetic disorders is better studied, many exceptions to 
strict Mendelian inheritance rules arise. This section addresses four impor-
tant exceptions.
Epigenetics
One of the biggest challenges to Mendel’s laws comes from a phenomenon 
called epigenetics. The prefix epi- means “over” or “above.” In epigenetics, 
organisms with identical alleles (including identical twins) may exhibit differ-
ent phenotypes.
The difference in phenotypes doesn’t come from the genes themselves but 
from elsewhere in the chemical structure of the DNA molecule (you can find 
out all about DNA’s chemical and physical structure in Chapter 6). What hap-
pens is that tiny chemical tags, called methyl groups, are attached to the DNA. 
In essence, the tags act like the operating system in your computer that tells 
the programs how often to work, where, and when. In the case of epigenetics, 
the tags can shut genes down or turn genes on. Not only that, but the tags are 
inherited by the next generation as well.
Some epigenetic effects are normal and useful: They control how your vari-
ous cells look and behave, like the differences between a heart muscle cell 
and a skin cell. However, other tags act like mutations and cause diseases 
like cancer (discover more about the role DNA plays in cancer in Chapter 14). 
Epigenetics is an exciting area of genetics research that will yield answers 
to how the genetic code in your DNA is affected by aging, your environment, 
and much more.
Genomic imprinting
Genomic imprinting is a special case of epigenetics. When traits are inherited 
on autosomal chromosomes, they’re generally expressed equally in males 
and females. In some cases, the gender of the parent who contributes the 
particular allele may affect how the trait is expressed; this is called genomic 
imprinting.

64
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
 
Sheep breeders in Oklahoma discovered an amusing example of genomic 
imprinting. A ram named Solid Gold had unusually large hindquarters for his 
breed. Eventually, Solid Gold sired other sheep, which also had very large . . . 
butts. The breed was named Callipyge, which is Greek for beautiful butt. It 
turns out that six genes affect rump size in sheep. As breeders mated 
Callipyge sheep, it quickly became clear that the trait didn’t obey Mendel’s 
rules. Eventually, researchers determined that the big rump phenotype 
resulted only when the father passed on the trait. Callipyge ewes can’t pass 
their big rumps on to their offspring.
The reasons behind genomic imprinting are still unclear. In the case of 
Callipyge sheep, scientists think there may be a mutation in a gene that regu-
lates other genes, but why the expression of the gene is controlled by only 
paternal chromosomes remains a mystery. (Genomic imprinting is a big issue 
in cloning as well; see Chapter 20 for more on that topic.)
Anticipation
Sometimes, traits seem to grow stronger and gain more expressivity from one 
generation to the next. The strengthening of a trait as it’s inherited is called 
anticipation. Schizophrenia is a disorder that’s highly heritable and often 
shows a pattern of anticipation. It affects a person’s mood and how she views 
herself and the world. Some patients experience vivid hallucinations and 
delusions that lead them to possess strongly held beliefs such as paranoia or 
grandeur. The age of onset of schizophrenic symptoms and the strength of 
the symptoms tend to increase from one generation to the next.
The reason behind anticipation in schizophrenia and other disorders, such 
as Huntington disease, may be that during replication (covered in Chapter 7), 
repeated sections of the DNA within the gene are easily duplicated by accident 
(see Chapter 13 for more on mutation by duplication). Thus, in successive 
generations, the gene actually gets longer. As the gene grows longer, its effects 
get stronger as well, leading to anticipation. In disorders affecting the brain, 
the mutation leads to malformed proteins (see Chapter 9 for how genes are 
translated into protein). The malformed proteins accumulate in the brain cells, 
eventually causing cells to die. Because the malformed proteins may get larger 
in successive generations, the effects show up when the person is young or 
they manifest themselves as a more severe form of the disease.

65
 Chapter 4: Law Enforcement: Mendel’s Laws Applied to Complex Traits
Environmental effects
Most traits show little evidence of environmental effect. However, the envi-
ronment that some organisms live in controls the phenotype that some of 
its genes produce. For example, the gene that gives a Himalayan rabbit its 
characteristic phenotype of dark feet, ears, nose, and tail is a good example 
of a trait that varies in its expression based on the animal’s environment. The 
pigment that produces dark fur in any animal results from the presence of an 
enzyme that the animal’s body produces. But in this case, the enzyme’s effect 
is deactivated at normal body temperature. Thus, the allele that produces 
pigment in the rabbit’s fur is expressed only in the cooler parts of the body. 
That’s why Himalayan rabbits are all white when they’re born (they’ve been 
kept warm inside their mother’s body) but get dark feet, ears, noses, and tails 
later in life. (Himalayans also change color seasonally and get lighter during 
the warmer months.)
Phenylketonuria (see “One gene with many phenotypes” earlier in this 
chapter) and other disorders of metabolism also depend on environmental 
factors — such as diet — for the expression of the trait.

Chapter 5
Differences Matter: 
The Genetics of Sex
In This Chapter
▶ How sex is determined in humans and other animals
▶ What sorts of disorders are associated with sex chromosomes
▶ How sex affects other traits
S
ex is a term with many meanings. For geneticists, sex usually refers 
to two related concepts: the phenotype of sex (either male or female) 
and reproduction. It’s hard to underestimate the importance of sex when it 
comes to genetics. Sex influences the inheritance of traits from one genera-
tion to the next and how those traits are expressed. Sexual reproduction 
allows organisms to create an amazing amount of genetic diversity via their 
offspring, which is handy because genetically diverse populations are more 
resilient in the face of disease and disaster. Many different individuals car-
rying many different alleles of the same genes increases the likelihood that 
some individuals will be resistant to disease and the effects of disaster and 
will pass that resistance on to their offspring. (For more on the importance of 
genetic diversity, flip to Chapter 17.)
In this chapter, you discover how chromosomes act to determine sex in 
humans and other organisms, how sex influences the expression of various 
nonsex (autosomal) traits, and what happens when too many or too few sex 
chromosomes are present.
X-rated: How You Got So Sexy
 
Presumably since the beginning of time, humans have been aware of the dis-
similarities between the sexes. But it wasn’t until 1905 that Nettie Stevens 
stared through a microscope long enough to discover the role of the Y chro-
mosome in the grand scheme of things. Until Stevens came along, the much 
larger X chromosome was credited with creating all the celebrated differences 
between males and females.

68
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
From a genetics standpoint, the phenotypes of sex — male and female — 
depend on which type of gamete an individual produces. If an individual pro-
duces sperm (or has the potential to, when mature), it’s considered male. If 
the individual can produce eggs, it’s considered female. Some organisms are 
both male and female (that is, they’re capable of producing viable eggs and 
sperm); this situation is referred to as monoecy (pronounced mo-knee-see, 
which means “one house”). Many plants, fish, and invertebrates (organisms 
lacking a bony spine like yours) are monoecious (mo-knee-shus).
Humans are dioecious (di-ee-shus; literally “two houses”), meaning that indi-
viduals have either functional male or female reproductive structures, but 
not both. Most of the species you’re familiar with are dioecious: Mammals, 
insects, birds, reptiles, and many plants all have separate genders.
Organisms with separate genders get their sex phenotypes in various ways.
 
✓ Chromosomal sex determination occurs when the presence or absence 
of certain chromosomes control sex phenotype.
 
✓ Genetic sex determination occurs when particular genes control sex 
phenotype.
 
✓ The environment an organism develops in may determine its gender.
This section examines how chromosomes, genetics, and the environment 
determine whether an organism is male or female.
Sex determination in humans
 
In humans and most other mammals, males and females have the same 
number of chromosomes (humans have 46) in pairs (making humans diploid). 
Sex phenotype is determined by two sex chromosomes: X and Y. (Figure 5-1 
shows the basic size and shape of these chromosomes.) Female humans have 
two X chromosomes, and male humans have one X and one Y. Check out the 
sidebar “The X (and Y) files” for how X and Y got their names. (Chromosomes 
have their stereotypical sausage shapes only during metaphase of mitosis or 
meiosis. Check out Chapter 2 for more details on mitosis and meiosis.)
The very important X
During metaphase, the X chromosome truly has an x-shape, with the centro-
mere placed roughly in the middle (see Chapter 2 for more about chromo-
somes and their shapes). Genetically speaking, unlike the relatively puny Y 
chromosome, X is quite large. Of the 23 pairs of chromosomes ordered by size, 
X occupies the eighth place, weighing in at slightly over 150 million base pairs 
long. (See Chapter 6 for more about how DNA is measured in base pairs.)

The X chromosome is home to between 900 and 1,200 genes and is incredibly 
important for normal human development. When no X is present, the zygote 
can’t commence development. Table 5-1 lists a few of X’s genes that are 
required for survival. Surprisingly, only one gene on X has a role in determin-
ing female phenotype; all the other genes that act to make females are on the 
autosomal (nonsex) chromosomes.

In all mammals (including humans), the developing embryo starts in what 
developmental biologists refer to as an indifferent stage, meaning the embryo 
has the potential to be either male or female. Here’s how sex determination 
in mammals works: In roughly the fourth week of development, the embryo 
begins to develop a region near the kidneys called the genital ridge. Three 
genes (all on autosomes) kick in to convert the genital ridge tissue into tissue 
that can become sex organs. The tissue that’s present by week seven in the 
embryo’s development is called the bipotential gonad because it can become 
either testes or ovary tissue depending on which genes act next.

70
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
If the embryo has at least one X and lacks a Y chromosome, two genes work 
together to give the embryo the female phenotype. The first gene, called 
DAX1, is on the X chromosome. The second gene, WNT4, is on chromosome 
1. Together, these genes stimulate the development of ovary tissue. The 
ovary tissue excretes the hormone estrogen, which turns on other genes that 
control the development of the remaining female reproductive structures.
The not very significant Y
 
In comparison to X, the Y chromosome is scrawny, antisocial, and surprisingly 
expendable. Y contains between 70 and 300 genes along its 50-million base 
pair length and is generally considered the smallest and least gene-rich human 
chromosome. Most of Y doesn’t seem to code for any genes at all; slightly over 
half the Y chromosome is junk DNA. Individuals with only one X and no Y can 
survive the condition (known as Turner syndrome; see the section “Sex-
Determination Disorders in Humans” later in this chapter), demonstrating that 
Y supports no genes required for survival. Almost all the genes Y has are 
involved in male sex determination and sexual function.
Unlike the other chromosomes, most of Y doesn’t recombine during meio-
sis (see Chapter 2 for details) because Y is so different from X — it has only 
small regions near the telomeres (the tips of chromosomes) that allow X 
and Y to pair during meiosis. Pairs of human chromosomes are considered 
homologous, meaning the members of each pair are identical in structure 
and shape and contain similar (although not identical) genetic information. 
The X (and Y) files
Hermann Henking discovered the X chromo-
some while studying insects in the early 1890s. 
He wasn’t quite sure what the lonely, unpaired 
structure did, but it seemed different from the 
rest of the chromosomes he was looking at. 
So rather than assign it a number (chromo-
somes are generally numbered according to 
size, largest to smallest), he called it X. In the 
early 1900s, Clarence McClung decided, rightly, 
that Henking’s X was actually a chromosome, 
but he wasn’t quite sure of its role. McClung 
started calling X the accessory chromosome. 
At the time, what we know as the Y chromo-
some carried the cumbersome moniker of 
small ideochromosome. The prefix ideo- means 
“unknown” — in other words, McClung and 
other geneticists of the time had no idea what 
the little Y guy was for.
Edmund Wilson discovered XX-XY sex determi-
nation in insects in 1905 (independent of Nettie 
Stevens, who accomplished the same feat that 
year). Wilson seems to have had the honor of 
naming the Y chromosome. According to three 
genetics historians I consulted on the topic, 
Wilson first used the name Y in 1909. The Y des-
ignation was in no way romantic — it was just 
convenient shorthand. The new name caught 
on rapidly, and by 1914 or so, all geneticists 
were calling the two sex chromosomes X and Y.

71
 Chapter 5: Differences Matter: The Genetics of Sex
X and Y aren’t homologous — they’re different in size and shape and carry 
completely different sets of genes. Homologous autosomes can freely swap 
information during meiosis (a process referred to as crossing-over), but X and 
Y don’t share enough information to allow crossing-over to occur. X and Y do 
pair up as if they were homologous so that the right number of chromosomes 
gets parsed out during meiosis.
 
Because Y doesn’t recombine with other chromosomes, it’s unusually good 
for tracing how men have traveled and settled around the world. The Y chro-
mosome is even helping to clarify British history. For centuries, people have 
believed that Anglo-Saxons conquered Britain and more or less ran everyone 
else out. In a 2003 survey of over 1,700 British men, however, geneticists 
found evidence that different parts of the British Isles have differing paternal 
histories reflecting a complex and rich history of invasions, immigration, and 
intermarriage.
The most important of Y’s genes is SRY, the Sex-determining Region Y gene, 
which was discovered in 1990. The SRY gene is what makes men. SRY codes 
for a mere 204 amino acids (flip to Chapter 10 for how the genetic code works 
to make proteins from amino acids). Unlike most genes (and most of Y, for 
that matter), SRY is junk-free — it contains no introns (sequences that inter-
rupt the expressed part of genes; see Chapter 9 for a full description).
SRY’s most important function is starting the development of testes. Embryos 
that have at least one Y chromosome differentiate into males when the SRY 
gene is turned on during week seven of development. SRY acts with at least 
one other gene (on chromosome 17) to stimulate the expression of the male 
phenotype in the form of testes. The testes themselves secrete testoster-
one, the hormone responsible for the expression of most traits belonging to 
males. (To find out how gene expression works, turn to Chapter 11.)
Sex determination in other organisms
In mammals, sex determination is directed by the presence of sex chro-
mosomes that turn on the appropriate genes to make male or female phe-
notypes. In most other organisms, however, sex determination is highly 
variable. This section looks at how various arrangements of chromosomes, 
genes, and even temperature affect the determination of sex.
Insects
 
When geneticists first began studying chromosomes in the early 1900s, insects 
were the organisms of choice. Grasshopper, beetle, and especially fruit fly 
chromosomes were carefully stained and studied under microscopes (check 
out Chapter 15 for how geneticists study chromosomes). Much of what we 
now know about chromosomes in general and sex determination in particular 
comes from the work of these early geneticists.

72
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
In 1901, Clarence McClung determined that female grasshoppers had two 
X chromosomes, but males had only one (take a look at the sidebar “The X 
(and Y) files” for more about McClung’s role in discovering the sex chromo-
somes). This arrangement, now known as XX-XO, with the O representing 
a lack of a chromosome, occurs in many insects. For these organisms, the 
number of X chromosomes in relation to the autosomal chromosomes deter-
mines maleness or femaleness. Two doses of X produce a female. One X pro-
duces a male.
In the XX-XO system, females (XX) are homogametic, which means that every 
gamete (in this case, eggs) that the individual produces has the same set of 
chromosomes composed of one of each autosome and one X. Males (XO) are 
heterogametic; their sperm can come in two different types. Half of a male’s 
gametes have one set of autosomes and an X; the other half have one set of 
autosomes and no sex chromosome at all. This imbalance in the number of 
chromosomes is what determines sex for XX-XO organisms.
A similar situation occurs in fruit flies. Male fruit flies are XY, but the Y 
doesn’t have any sex-determining genes on it. Instead, sex is determined 
by the number of X chromosomes compared to the number of sets of auto-
somes. The number of X chromosomes an individual has is divided by the 
number of sets of autosomes (sometimes referred to as the haploid number, 
n; see Chapter 2). This equation is the X to autosome (A) ratio, or X:A ratio. 
If the X:A ratio is 1⁄2 or less, the individual is male. For example, an XX fly with 
two sets of autosomes would yield a ratio of 1 (2 divided by 2) and would 
be female. An XY fly with two sets of autosomes would yield a ratio of 1⁄2 (1 
divided by 2) and would be male.
Bees and wasps have no sex chromosomes at all. Their sex is determined by 
whether the individual is diploid (with paired chromosomes) or haploid (with 
a single set of chromosomes). Females develop from fertilized eggs and are 
diploid. Males develop from unfertilized eggs and are therefore haploid.
Birds
Like humans, birds have two sex chromosomes: Z and W. Female birds are 
ZW, and males are ZZ. Sex determination in birds isn’t well understood; 
two genes, one on the Z and the other on the W, both seem to play roles 
in whether an individual becomes male or female. The Z-linked gene sug-
gests that, like the XX-XO system in insects (see the preceding section), 
the number of Z chromosomes may help determine sex (but with reversed 
results from XX-XO). On the other hand, the W-linked gene suggests the exis-
tence of a “female-determining” gene. The chicken genome sequence (see 
Chapter 8 for the scoop) will provide critical information for geneticists to 
learn how sex is determined in birds. (Sex determination for some birdlike 
animals is even more complex; check out the hard-to-believe story of the 
platypus in Chapter 24.)

73
 Chapter 5: Differences Matter: The Genetics of Sex
Reptiles
Sex chromosomes determine the sex of most reptiles (like snakes and lizards). 
However, the sex of most turtles and all crocodiles and alligators is deter-
mined by the temperature the eggs experience during incubation. Female 
turtles and crocodilians dig nests and bury their eggs in the ground. Females 
usually choose nest sites in open areas likely to receive a lot of sunlight. 
Female turtles don’t bother to guard their eggs; they lay ’em and forget ’em. 
Alligators and crocodiles, on the other hand, guard their nests (quite aggres-
sively, as I can personally attest) but let the warmth of the sun do the work.
In turtles, lower temperatures (78–82 degrees Fahrenheit) produce all males. 
At temperatures over 86 degrees, all eggs become females. Intermediate 
temperatures produce both sexes. Male alligators, on the other hand, are 
produced only at intermediate temperatures (around 91 degrees). Cooler 
conditions (84–88 degrees) produce only females; really warm temperatures 
(95 degrees) produce all females also.
Nature’s gender benders
Some organisms have location-dependent sex 
determination, meaning the organism becomes 
male or female depending on where it ends up. 
Take the slipper limpet, for example. Slipper lim-
pets (otherwise known by their highly sugges-
tive scientific name of Crepidula fornicata) have 
concave, unpaired shells and cling to rocks in 
shallow seawater environments. (Basically, 
they look like half of an oyster.) All young slip-
per limpets start out as male, but a male can 
become female as a result of his (soon to be her) 
circumstances. If a young slipper limpet settles 
on bare rock, it becomes female. If a male 
settles on top of another male, the one on the 
bottom becomes a female to accommodate the 
new circumstances. If a male is removed from 
the top of a pile and placed on bare rock, he 
becomes a she and awaits the arrival of a male. 
After an individual becomes female, she’s stuck 
with the change and is a female from then on.
Some fish also change sex depending on their 
locations or their social situations. Blue-headed 
wrasse, large reef fish familiar to many scuba 
divers, change into females if a male is present. 
If no male is around, or if the local male disap-
pears, large females change sex to become 
males. The fish’s brain and nervous system con-
trol its ability to switch from one sex to another. 
An organ in the brain called the hypothalamus 
(you have one, too, by the way) regulates sex 
hormones and controls growth of the needed 
reproductive tissues.
To add to the list of the truly bizarre, a para-
sitic critter that lives inside certain fish has an 
unusual way of changing gender: cannibalism. 
When a male Ichthyoxenus fushanensis, which 
is a sort of parasitic pill bug (you may know the 
isopod as a roly-poly), eats a female (or vice 
versa), the diner changes sex — that is, he 
becomes a she. In the case of the isopod, the 
sex change is a form of hermaphroditism where 
the genders are expressed sequentially and in 
response to some change in the environment 
or diet.

An enzyme called aromatase seems to be the key player in organisms with 
temperature-dependent sex determination. Aromatase converts testosterone 
into estrogen. When estrogen levels are high, the embryo becomes a female. 
When estrogen levels are low, the embryo becomes a male. Aromatase activ-
ity varies with temperature. In some turtles, for example, aromatase is essen-
tially inactive at 77 degrees, and all eggs in that environment hatch as males. 
When temperatures around the eggs get to 86 degrees, aromatase activity 
increases dramatically, and all the eggs become females.
Sex-Determination Disorders in Humans
Homologous chromosomes line up and part company during the first phase 
of meiosis, which I explain in Chapter 2. The dividing up of chromosome pairs 
ensures that each gamete gets only one copy of each chromosome, and thus 
that zygotes (created from the fusion of gametes; see Chapter 2) have one 
pair of each chromosome without odd copies thrown in. But sometimes, mis-
takes occur. Xs or Ys can get left out, or extra copies can remain. These chro-
mosomal delivery errors are caused by nondisjunction, which results when 
chromosomes fail to segregate normally during meiosis. (Chapter 15 has more 
information about nondisjunction and other chromosome disorders.)
Extra chromosomes can create all sorts of developmental problems. In organ-
isms that have chromosomal sex determination, like humans, male organisms 
normally have only one X, giving them one copy of each gene on the X and 
allowing some genes on the X chromosome to act like dominant genes when, 
in fact, they’re recessive (take a look ahead at “X-linked disorders” for more). 
Female organisms have to cope with two copies, or doses, of the X chromo-
some and its attendant genes. If both copies of a female’s X were active, she’d 
get twice as much X-linked gene product as a male. (X-linked means any and 
all genes on the X chromosome.) The extra protein produced by two copies 
of the gene acting at once derails normal development. The solution to this 
problem is a process called dosage compensation, when the amount of gene 
product is equalized in both sexes.
Dosage compensation is achieved in one of two ways:
 
✓ The organism increases gene expression on the X to get a double dose 
for males. This is what happens in fruit flies, for example.
 
✓ The female inactivates essentially all the genes on one X to get a “half” 
dose of gene expression.
Both methods equalize the amount of gene product produced by each sex. In 
humans, dosage compensation is achieved by X inactivation; one X chromo-
some is permanently and irreversibly turned off in every cell of a female’s body.

75
 Chapter 5: Differences Matter: The Genetics of Sex
 
X inactivation in humans is controlled by a single gene, called XIST (for X 
Inactive-Specific Transcript), that lies on the X chromosome. When a female 
zygote starts to develop, it goes through many rounds of cell division. When 
the zygote gets to be a little over 16 cells in size, X inactivation takes place. 
The XIST gene gets turned on and goes through the normal process of tran-
scription (covered in Chapter 9). The RNA (a close cousin of DNA; see Chapter 
9 to learn more) produced when XIST is transcribed isn’t translated into pro-
tein (see Chapter 10 for how translation works and what it does). Instead, the 
XIST transcript binds directly to one of the X chromosomes to inactivate its 
genes (much like RNA interference; see Chapter 11 for the details).
X inactivation causes the entire inactivated chromosome to change form; it 
becomes highly condensed and genetically inert. Highly condensed chromo-
somes are easy for geneticists to spot because they soak up a lot of dye (see 
Chapter 15 for how geneticists study chromosomes using dyes). Murray Barr 
was the first person to observe the highly condensed, inactivated X chromo-
somes in mammals. Therefore, these inactivated chromosomes are called 
Barr bodies.
 
You should remember two very important things about X inactivation:
 
✓ In humans, X inactivation is random. Only one X remains turned on, but 
which X remains on is completely up to chance.
 
✓ If more than two Xs are present, only one remains completely active.
The ultimate result of X inactivation is that the tissues that arise from each 
embryonic cell have a “different” X. Because females get one X from their 
father and the other from their mother, their Xs are likely to carry differ-
ent alleles of the same genes. Therefore, their tissues may express different 
phenotypes depending on which X (Mom’s or Dad’s) remains active. This 
random expression of X chromosomes is best illustrated in cats.
Calico and tortoiseshell cats both have patchy-colored fur (often orange 
and black, but other combinations are possible). The genes that control 
these fur colors are on the X chromosomes. Male cats are usually all one 
color because they always have only one active X chromosome (and are 
XY). Females (XX), on the other hand, also have one active X chromosome, 
but the identity of the active X (maternal or paternal) varies over the cat’s 
body. Therefore, calico females get a patchy distribution of color depend-
ing on which X is active (that is, as long as her parents had different alleles 
on their Xs). If you have a calico male cat, he possesses an extra X and has 
the genotype XXY. XXY cats have normal phenotypes. Unlike cats, humans 
with extra sex chromosomes have a variety of health problems, which I 
summarize later in this chapter.

76
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Extra Xs
Both males and females can have multiple X chromosomes, each with dif-
ferent genetic and phenotypic consequences. When females have extra X 
chromosomes, the condition is referred to as Poly-X (poly meaning “many”). 
Poly-X females tend to be taller than average and often have a thin build. 
Most Poly-X women develop normally and experience normal puberty, men-
struation, and fertility. Rarely, XXX (referred to as Triplo-X) females have 
mental retardation; the severity of mental retardation and other health prob-
lems experienced by Poly-X females increases with the number of extra Xs. 
About one in every 1,000 girls is XXX.
Males with multiple X chromosomes are affected with Klinefelter syndrome. 
Roughly one in every 500 boys is XXY. Most often, males with Klinefelter 
are XXY, but some males have as many as four extra X chromosomes. Like 
females, males affected by Klinefelter undergo X inactivation so that only one 
X chromosome is active. However, the extra X genes act in the embryo before 
X inactivation takes place. These extra doses of X genes are responsible 
for the phenotype of Klinefelter. Generally, males with Klinefelter are taller 
than average and have impaired fertility (usually they’re sterile). Men with 
Klinefelter often have reduced secondary sexual characteristics (such as less 
facial hair) and sometimes have some breast enlargement due to impaired 
production of testosterone.

or the American Association for Klinefelter Syndrome Information and Support

Extra Ys
Occasionally, human males have two or more Y chromosomes and one X 
chromosome. Most XYY men have a normal male phenotype, but they’re 
often taller and, as children, grow a bit faster than their XY peers. Studies con-
ducted during the 1960s and 1970s indicated that XYY men were more prone 
to criminal activity than XY men. Since then, findings have documented learn-
ing disabilities (XYY boys may start talking later than XY boys), but it seems 
that XYY males are no more likely to commit crimes than XY males.
One X and no Y
In some cases, individuals end up with one X chromosome. Such individuals 
have Turner syndrome and are female. Often, affected persons never undergo 
puberty and don’t acquire secondary sex characteristics of adult women 
(namely, breast development and menstruation), and they tend to have short 

77

stature. In most other ways, girls and women with Turner syndrome are com-
pletely normal. Occasionally, however, they have kidney or heart defects. 
Turner syndrome (also referred to as monosomy X, meaning only one X is 
present) affects about one in 2,500 girls.

Found on Sex Chromosomes: 
Sex-linked Inheritance
Sex not only controls an organism’s reproductive options; it also has a lot to 
do with which genes are expressed and how. Sex-linked genes are ones that 
are actually located on the sex chromosomes themselves. Some traits are 
truly X-linked (such as hemophilia) or Y-linked (such as hairy ears). Other 
traits are expressed differently in males and females even though the genes 
that control the traits are located on nonsex chromosomes. This section 
explains how sex influences (and sometimes controls) the phenotypes of 
various genetic conditions.
X-linked disorders
Genes on the X chromosome control X-linked traits. In 1910, Thomas H. 
Morgan discovered X-linked inheritance while studying fruit flies. Morgan’s 
observations made him doubt the validity of Mendelian inheritance (see 
Chapter 3). His skepticism about Mendelian inheritance stemmed from the 
fact that he kept getting unexpected phenotypic ratios when he crossed red- 
and white-eyed flies. He thought the trait of white eyes was simply recessive, 
but when he crossed red-eyed females with white-eyed males, he got all red-
eyed flies — the exact result you’d expect from a monohybrid cross. The F2 
generation showed the expected 3:1 ratio, too.
But when Morgan crossed white-eyed females with red-eyed males, all the 
expected relationships fell apart. The F1 generation had a 1:1 ratio of white- 
to red-eyed flies. In the F2, the phenotypic ratio of white-eyed to red-eyed 
flies was also 1:1 — not at all what Mendel would have predicted. Morgan 
was flustered until he looked at which sex showed which phenotype.
In Morgan’s F1 offspring from his white-eyed mothers and red-eyed fathers, 
all the sons were white-eyed (see Figure 5-2). Daughters of white-eyed 
females were red-eyed. In the F2, Morgan got equal numbers of white- and 
red-eyed males and females.

Morgan was well aware of the work on sex chromosomes conducted by 
Nettie Stevens and Edmund Wilson in 1905, and he knew that fruit flies have 
XX-XY sex chromosomes. Morgan and his students examined the phenotypes 
of 13 million fruit flies to confirm that the gene for eye color was located on 
the X chromosome. (The next time you see a fruit fly in your kitchen, imagine 
looking through a microscope long enough to examine 13 million flies!)
As it turns out, the gene for white eye color in fruit flies is recessive. The only 
time it’s expressed in females is when it’s homozygous. Males, on the other 
hand, show the trait when they have only one copy of the X-linked gene. For 
all X-linked recessive traits, the gene acts like a dominant gene when it’s in 
the hemizygous (one copy) state. Any male inheriting the affected X chromo-
some shows the trait as if it were present in two copies (X-linked dominant 
disorders also occur; see Chapter 12 for the details).
In humans, X-linked recessive disorders rarely show up in females. Instead, 
X-linked recessive traits affect sons of women who are carriers. To see the 
distribution of X-linked recessive disorders, check out the family tree for the 
royal families of Europe in Chapter 12. Queen Victoria was apparently a car-
rier for the X-linked gene that causes hemophilia. None of Queen Victoria’s 
ancestors appears to have had hemophilia; geneticists think that the muta-
tion originated with Queen Victoria herself (see Chapter 13 for more about 
spontaneous mutations like these). Queen Victoria had one son with hemo-
philia, and two of her daughters were carriers.

79
 Chapter 5: Differences Matter: The Genetics of Sex
Sex-limited traits
Sex-limited traits are inherited in the normal autosomal fashion but are 
never expressed in one sex, regardless of whether the gene is heterozygous 
or homozygous. Such traits are said to have 100 percent penetrance in one 
sex and zero penetrance in the other. (Penetrance is the probability that 
an individual having a dominant allele will show its effects; see Chapter 4 
for more.) Traits such as color differences between male and female birds 
are sex-limited; both males and females inherit the genes for color, but the 
genes are expressed only in one sex (usually the male). In mammals, both 
males and females possess the genes necessary for milk production, but 
only females express these genes, which are controlled by hormone levels 
in the female’s body (see Chapter 11 for more about how gene expression is 
controlled).
One trait in humans that’s male-limited is precocious puberty. The cor-
responding gene, located on chromosome 2, causes boys to undergo the 
changes associated with teenage years, such as a deeper voice and beard and 
body hair growth, at very early ages (sometimes as young as 3 years of age). 
The allele responsible for precocious puberty acts as an autosomal domi-
nant, expressed only in males. Females, regardless of genotype, never exhibit 
this kind of precocious puberty.
Sex-influenced traits
Sex-influenced traits are coded by genes on autosomes, but the pheno-
type depends on the sex of the individual carrying the affected gene. Sex-
influenced traits come down to the issue of penetrance: The traits are more 
penetrant in males than females. Horns, hair, and other traits that make male 
organisms look different from females are usually sex-influenced traits.
In humans, male-pattern baldness is a sex-influenced trait. The gene cred-
ited with male hair loss is on chromosome 15. Baldness is autosomal domi-
nant in men, and women only show the phenotype of hair loss when they’re 
homozygous for the gene. The gene for male-pattern baldness has also been 
implicated in polycystic ovary disease in women. Women with polycystic 
ovary disease experience reduced fertility and other disorders of the repro-
ductive system. The gene seems to act as an autosomal dominant for ovar-
ian disease in women, much as it does for male-pattern baldness in men, 
so women with ovarian disease are usually heterozygous for the condition 
(and thus, not bald).

80
Part I: The Lowdown on Genetics: Just the Basics 
Y-linked traits
The Y chromosome carries few genes, and the genes it does carry are all 
related to male sex determination. Therefore, most of the Y-linked traits 
discovered so far have something to do with male sexual function and fertil-
ity. As you may expect, Y-linked traits are passed strictly from father to son. 
All Y-linked traits are expressed, because the Y is hemizygous (having one 
copy) and therefore has no other chromosome to offset gene expression. The 
amount of penetrance and expressivity that Y-linked traits show varies (see 
Chapter 4 for more details about penetrance and expressivity of autosomal 
dominant traits).
One trait that seems to be Y-linked but isn’t related to sexual function is 
hairy ears. Men with hairy ears grow varying amounts of hair on their outer 
ears or from the ear canals. The trait appears to be incompletely penetrant, 
meaning not all sons of hairy-eared fathers show the trait. Hairy ears also 
show variable expressivity from very hairy to only a few stray hairs. Aren’t 
you glad that geneticists have focused the powers of science at their disposal 
on making such important discoveries? Check out the section “The not very 
significant Y” earlier in this chapter for a rundown of other Y-linked genes in 
humans and other mammals.

DNA: The Genetic 
Material

In this part . . .
A
ll life on earth depends on the essentially iconic dou-
ble helix that holds all the genetic information of 
each and every individual. The physical and chemical 
makeup of DNA is responsible for DNA’s massive storage 
capacity and controls how it’s copied and how its mes-
sage is passed on.
In this part, I explain how DNA is put together and how 
the messages are read and ultimately expressed as the 
traits of the organisms you see every day. The genetic 
code relies on DNA’s close cousin, RNA, to carry the 
important messages of genes. The ultimate fate of DNA’s 
messages is to create proteins, the building blocks of life. 
The following chapters tell you all about how DNA’s blue-
print is assembled from start to finish.

t’s time to meet the star of the genetics show: deoxyribonucleic acid, other-
wise known as DNA. If the title of this chapter hasn’t impressed upon you 
the importance and magnitude of those three little letters, consider that DNA 
is also referred to as “the genetic material” or “the molecule of heredity.” And 
you thought your title was impressive!
Every living thing on earth, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whale, 
uses DNA to store genetic information and transmits that info from one gen-
eration to the next; a copy of some (or all) of every creature’s DNA is passed 
on to its offspring. The developing organism then uses DNA as a blueprint to 
make all its body parts. (Some non-living things use DNA to transmit informa-
tion, too; see the nearby sidebar “DNA and the undead: The world of viruses” 
for details.)
To get an idea of how much information DNA stores, think about how com-
plex your body is. You have hundreds of kinds of tissues that all perform 
different functions. It takes a lot of DNA to catalog all that. (See the section 
“Discovering DNA” later in this chapter to find out how scientists learned 
that DNA is the genetic material of all known life forms.)
The structure of DNA provides a simple way for the molecule to copy itself 
(see Chapter 7) and protects genetic messages from getting garbled (see 
Chapter 13). That structure is at the heart of forensic methods used to solve 
crimes, too (see Chapter 18). But before you can start exploring genetic 
information and applications of DNA, you need to have a handle on its chemi-
cal makeup and physical structure. In this chapter, I explore the essential 
makeup of DNA and the various sorts of DNA present in living things.

84
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Deconstructing the Double Helix
If you’re like most folks, when you think of DNA, you think of a double helix. 
But DNA isn’t just a double helix; it’s a huge molecule — so huge that it’s 
called a macromolecule. It can even be seen with the naked eye! (Check out 
the nearby sidebar “Molecular madness: Extracting DNA at home” for an 
experiment you can do to see actual DNA.) If you were to lay out, end to 
end, all the DNA from just one of your cells, the line would be a little over 
6 feet long! You have roughly 100,000,000,000,000 cells in your body (that’s 
100 trillion, if you don’t feel like counting zeros). Put another way, laid out 
altogether, the DNA in your body would easily stretch to the sun and back — 
nearly 100 times!
You’re probably wondering how a huge DNA molecule can fit into a teeny 
tiny cell so small that you can’t see it with the naked eye. Here’s how: DNA is 
tightly packed in a process called supercoiling. Much like a phone cord that’s 
been twisted around and around on itself, supercoiling takes DNA and wraps 
it around proteins to form nucleosomes. Other proteins, called histones, hold 
the coils together. The nuclesomes and histones together form a structure 
similar to beads on a string. The whole “necklace” twists around itself so 
tightly that over 6 feet of DNA is compressed into only a few thousandths of 
an inch.
Although the idea of a DNA path to the sun works great for visualizing the 
size of the DNA molecule, an organism’s DNA usually doesn’t exist as one 
long piece. Rather, strands of DNA are divided into chromosomes, which are 
relatively short pieces. (I introduce chromosomes in Chapter 2 and discuss 
related disorders in Chapter 15.) In humans and all other eukaryotes (organ-
isms whose cells have nuclei; see Chapter 2 for more), a full set of chromo-
somes is stored in the nucleus of each cell. That means that practically every 
cell contains a complete set of instructions to build the entire organism! The 
instructions are packaged as genes. A gene determines exactly how a specific 
trait will be expressed. Genes and how they work are topics I discuss in detail 
in Chapter 11.
DNA and the undead: The world of viruses
Viruses contain DNA, but they aren’t considered 
living things. To reproduce, a virus must attach 
itself to a living cell. As soon as the virus finds a 
host cell, the virus injects its DNA into the cell 
and forces that cell to reproduce the virus. A 
virus can’t grow without stealing energy from a 
living cell, and it can’t move from one organism 
to another on its own. Although viruses come in 
all sorts of fabulous shapes, they don’t have all 
the components that cells do; in general, a virus 
is just DNA surrounded by a protein shell. So a 
virus isn’t alive, but it’s not quite dead either. 
Creepy, huh?

85
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
 
Cells with nuclei are found only in eukaryotes; however, not every eukaryotic 
cell has a nucleus. For example, humans are eukaryotes, but human red 
blood cells don’t have nuclei. For more on cells, flip to Chapter 2.
 
The tutorial offered at www.umass.edu/molvis/tutorials/dna/ provides 
an excellent complement to the information on the structure of DNA I cover in 
this section. You can access incredible, interactive views of precisely how 
DNA is put together to form the double helix. A click-and-drag feature allows 
you to turn the molecule in any direction to better understand the structure of 
the genetic material, to highlight different parts of the molecule, and to see 
exactly how all the parts fit together.
Molecular madness: Extracting DNA at home
Using this simple recipe, you can see DNA right 
in the comfort of your own home! You need a 
strawberry, salt, water, two clear jars or juice 
glasses, a sandwich bag, a measuring cup, a 
white coffee filter, clear liquid soap, and rub-
bing alcohol. (Other foods such as onions, 
bananas, kiwis, and tomatoes also work well 
if strawberries are unavailable.) After you’ve 
gathered these ingredients, follow these steps:
 1. Put slightly less than 3⁄8 cup of water into 
the measuring cup. Add 1⁄4 teaspoon of salt 
and enough clear liquid soap to make 3⁄8 
cup of liquid altogether. Stir gently until 
the salt dissolves into the solution.
 
 The salt provides sodium ions needed for 
the chemical reaction that allows you to 
see the DNA in Step 6. The soap causes the 
cell walls to burst, freeing the DNA inside.
 2. Remove the stem from the strawberry, 
place the strawberry into the sandwich 
bag, and seal the bag. Mash the straw-
berry thoroughly until completely pulver-
ized (I roll a juice glass repeatedly over my 
strawberry to pulverize it). Make sure you 
don’t puncture the bag.
 3. Add 2 teaspoons of the liquid soap-salt 
solution to the bag with the strawberry, 
and then reseal the bag. Mix gently by 
compressing the bag or rocking the bag 
back and forth for at least 45 seconds to 
one minute.
 4. Pour the strawberry mixture through the 
coffee filter into a clean jar. Let the mixture 
drain into the jar for 10 minutes.
 
 Straining gets rid of most of the cellular 
debris (a fancy word for gunk) and leaves 
behind the DNA in the clean solution.
 5. While the strawberry mixture is draining, 
pour 1⁄4 cup of rubbing alcohol into a clean 
jar and put the jar in the freezer. After 10 
minutes have elapsed, discard the coffee 
filter and pulverized strawberry remnants. 
Put the jar with the cold alcohol on a flat 
surface where it will be undisturbed, and 
pour the strained strawberry liquid into the 
alcohol.
 6. Let the jar sit for at least 5 minutes, and 
then check out the result of your DNA 
experiment. The cloudy substance that 
forms in the alcohol layer is the DNA from 
the strawberry. The cold alcohol helps 
strip the water molecules from the outside 
of the DNA molecule, causing the mol-
ecule to collapse on itself and “fall out” of 
the solution.

86
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Chemical ingredients of DNA
DNA is a remarkably durable molecule; it can be stored in ice or in a fossil-
ized bone for thousands of years. DNA can even stay in one piece for as long 
as 100,000 years under the right conditions. This durability is why scientists 
can recover DNA from 14,000-year-old mammoths and learn that the mam-
moth is most closely related to today’s Asian elephants. (Scientists have 
recovered ancient DNA from an amazing variety of organisms — check out 
the sidebar “Still around after all these years: Durable DNA” for more.) The 
root of DNA’s extreme durability lies in its chemical and structural makeup.
Still around after all these years: Durable DNA
When an organism dies, it starts to decay and its 
DNA starts to break down (for DNA, this means 
breaking into smaller and smaller pieces). But 
if a dead organism dries out or freezes shortly 
after death, decay slows down or even stops. 
Because of this kind of interference with decay, 
scientists have been able to recover DNA from 
animals and humans that roamed the earth as 
many as 100,000 years ago. This recovered DNA 
tells scientists a lot about life and the condi-
tions of the world long ago. But even this very 
durable molecule has its limits — about a mil-
lion years or so.
In 1991, hikers in the Italian Alps discovered a 
human body frozen in a glacier. As the glacier 
melted, the retreating ice left behind a secret 
concealed for over 5,000 years: an ancient 
human. The Ice Man, renamed Otzi, has yielded 
amazing insight into what life was like in north-
ern Italy thousands of years ago. Scientists 
have recovered DNA from this lonely shepherd, 
his clothing, and even the food in his stomach. 
Apparently, red deer and ibex meat were part 
of his last meal. His food was dusted with pollen 
from nearby trees, so even the forest he walked 
through can be identified!
By analyzing Otzi’s mitochondrial (mt) DNA, 
which he inherited from his mother (see the 
“Mitochondrial DNA” section later in this chap-
ter), scientists discovered that he wasn’t related 
to any modern European population studied so 
far. A team of investigators from Australia, led 
by the late Thomas Loy, examined blood found 
on Otzi’s clothing and possessions. Like modern 
forensic scientists, Loy’s team determined that 
four different people’s DNA fingerprints were 
present, in addition to Otzi’s own (to find out 
how DNA fingerprints are used to solve modern 
crimes, check out Chapter 18). The team found 
blood from two different people on Otzi’s arrow, 
a third person’s blood on his knife, and a fourth 
person’s blood on his clothing. These findings 
led people to speculate that he was involved in 
a fight shortly before he died.
Otzi isn’t the only ancient human whose DNA 
scientists are analyzing. Neandertals were 
humans that roamed the earth up to about 
30,000 years ago (give or take several centu-
ries). Using 38,000-year-old mtDNA, research-
ers have discovered that Neandertals had 
a substantially different mtDNA profile than 
modern humans, suggesting that while modern 
humans and Neandertals lived at the same 
time, they probably didn’t interbreed (or if they 
did, none of the descendants survived to be 
represented in human populations now). In 
addition, Neandertals were lactose-intolerant; 
they lacked the gene that codes for the enzyme 
that breaks down lactose (a sugar present in 
milk). Neandertals probably were able to speak 
much as we do — they carried a version of the 
gene associated with human speech.

87
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
 
Chemically, DNA is really simple. It’s made of three components: nitrogen-
rich bases, deoxyribose sugars, and phosphates. The three components, 
which I explain in the following sections, combine to form a nucleotide (see 
the section “Assembling the double helix: The structure of DNA” later in this 
chapter). Thousands of nucleotides come together in pairs to form a single 
molecule of DNA.
Covering the bases
Each DNA molecule contains thousands of copies of four specific nitrogen-
rich bases:
 
✓ Adenine (A)
 
✓ Guanine (G)
 
✓ Cytosine (C)
 
✓ Thymine (T)
As you can see in Figure 6-1, the bases are comprised of carbon (C), hydro-
gen (H), nitrogen (N), and oxygen (O) atoms.

were a chemist, you’d know that the word purine means a compound 
composed of two rings (check out adenine’s and guanine’s structures 
in Figure 6-1). If you’re like me (not a chemist), you’re likely still familiar 
with one common purine: caffeine.
 
✓ Pyrimidines: The two pyrimidine bases in DNA are cytosine and thymine. 
The term pyrimidine refers to chemicals that have a single six-sided ring 
structure (see cytosine’s and thymine’s structures in Figure 6-1).
 
Because they’re rings, all four bases are flat molecules. And as flat molecules, 
they’re able to stack up in DNA much like a stack of coins. The stacking 
arrangement accomplishes two things: It makes the molecule both compact 
and very strong.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
It’s been my experience that students and other folks get confused by spatial 
concepts where DNA is concerned. To see the chemical structures more 
easily, DNA is often drawn as if it were a flattened ladder. But in its true state, 
DNA isn’t flat — it’s three-dimensional. Because DNA is arranged in strands, 
it’s also linear. One way to think about this structure is to look at a phone cord 
(that is, if you can find a phone that isn’t cordless). A phone cord spirals in 
three dimensions, yet it’s linear (rope-like) in form. That’s sort of the shape 
DNA has, too.
The bases carry the information of DNA, but they can’t bond together by 
themselves. Two more ingredients are needed: a special kind of sugar and a 
phosphate.
Adding a spoonful of sugar and a little phosphate
To make a complete nucleotide (thousands of which combine to make one 
DNA molecule), the bases must attach to deoxyribose and a phosphate mole-
cule. Deoxyribose is ribose sugar that has lost one of its oxygen atoms. When 
your body breaks down adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule your 
body uses to power your cells, ribose is released with a phosphate molecule 
still attached to it. Ribose loses an oxygen atom to become deoxyribose (see 
Figure 6-2) and holds onto its phosphate molecule, which is needed to trans-
form a lone base into a nucleotide.

Ribose is the precursor for deoxyribose and is the chemical basis for RNA 
(see Chapter 9). The only difference between ribose and deoxyribose sugars 
is the presence or absence of an oxygen atom at the 2’ site.
 
Chemical structures are numbered so you can keep track of where atoms, 
branches, chains, and rings appear. On ribose sugars, numbers are followed 
by an apostrophe (’) to indicate the designation “prime.” The addition of 
“prime” prevents confusion with numbered sites on other molecules that 
bond with ribose.

89
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
Deoxy- means that an oxygen atom is missing from the sugar molecule and 
defines the D in DNA. As an added touch, some authors write “2-” before the 
“deoxy-” to indicate which site lacks the oxygen — the number 2 site, in this 
case. The OH group at the 3’ site of both ribose and deoxyribose is a reactive 
group. That means the oxygen atom at that site is free to interact chemically 
with other molecules.
Assembling the double helix: 
The structure of DNA
Nucleotides are the true building blocks of DNA. In Figure 6-3, you see the 
three components of a single nucleotide: one deoxyribose sugar, one phos-
phate, and one of the four bases. (Flip back to “Chemical ingredients of DNA” 
for the details of these components.) To make a complete DNA molecule, 
single nucleotides join to make chains that come together as matched pairs 
and form long double strands. This section walks you through the assembly 
process. To make the structure of DNA easier to understand, I start with how 
a single strand is put together.

DNA normally exists as a double-stranded molecule. In living things, new DNA 
strands are always put together using a preexisting strand as a pattern (see 
Chapter 7).

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Starting with one: Weaving a single strand
Hundreds of thousands of nucleotides link together to form a strand of DNA, 
but they don’t hook up haphazardly. Nucleotides are a bit like coins in that 
they have two “sides” — a phosphate side and a sugar side. Nucleotides can 
only make a connection by joining phosphates to sugars. The bases wind up 
parallel to each other (stacked like coins), and the sugars and phosphates 
run perpendicular to the stack of bases. A long strand of nucleotides put 
together in this way is called a polynucleotide strand (poly meaning “many”). 
In Figure 6-4, you can see how the nucleotides join together; a single strand 
would comprise one-half of the two-sided molecule (the chain of sugars, 
phosphates, and one of the pair of bases).
Because of the way the chemical structures are numbered, DNA has num-
bered “ends.” The phosphate end is referred to as the 5’ (5-prime) end, and 
the sugar end is referred to as the 3’ (3-prime) end. (If you missed the discus-
sion of how the chemical structure of deoxyribose is numbered, check out 
the earlier section “Adding a spoonful of sugar and a little phosphate.”) The 
bonds between a phosphate and two sugar molecules in a nucleotide strand 
are collectively called a phosphodiester bond. This is a fancy way of saying 
that two sugars are linked together by a phosphate in between.

After they’re formed, strands of DNA don’t enjoy being single; they’re always 
looking for a match. The arrangement in which strands of DNA match up is 
very, very important. A number of rules dictate how two lonely strands of 
DNA find their perfect matches and eventually form the star of the show, the 
molecule you’ve been waiting for — the double helix.

91
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
Doubling up: Adding the second strand
A complete DNA molecule has
 
✓ Two side-by-side polynucleotide strands twisted together
 
✓ Bases attached in pairs in the center of the molecule
 
✓ Sugars and phosphates on the outside, forming a backbone
If you were to untwist a DNA double helix and lay it flat, it would look a lot 
like a ladder (refer to Figure 6-4). The bases are attached to each other in the 
center to make the rungs, and the sugars are joined together by phosphates 
to form the sides of the ladder. It sounds pretty straightforward, but this 
ladder arrangement has some special characteristics.
 
If you were to separate the ladder into two polynucleotide strands, you’d see 
that the strands are oriented in opposite directions (shown with arrows in 
Figure 6-4). The locations of the sugar and the phosphate give nucleotides 
heads and tails, two distinct ends. (If you skipped that part, it’s in the earlier 
section “Starting with one: Weaving a single strand.”) The heads-tails (or in 
this case, 5’-3’) orientation applies here. This head-to-tail arrangement is 
called antiparallel, which is a fancy way of saying that something is parallel 
and running in opposite directions. Part of the reason the strands must be 
oriented this way is to guarantee that the dimensions of the DNA molecule 
are even along its entire length. If the strands were put together in a parallel 
arrangement, the angles between the atoms would be all wrong, and the 
strands wouldn’t fit together.
 
The molecule is guaranteed to be the same size all over because the matching 
bases complement each other, making whole pieces that are all the same size. 
Adenine complements thymine, and guanine complements cytosine. The bases 
always match up in this complementary fashion. Therefore, in every DNA mole-
cule, the amount of one base is equal to the amount of its complementary base. 
This condition is known as Chargaff’s rules (see the “Obeying Chargaff’s rules” 
section later in the chapter for more on the discovery of these rules).
 
Why can’t the bases match up in other ways? First, purines are larger than 
pyrimidines (see “Covering the bases” earlier in the chapter). So matching like 
with like would introduce irregularities in the molecule’s shape. Irregularities 
are bad because they can cause mistakes when the molecule is copied (see 
Chapter 13).
An important result of the bases’ complementary pairing is the way in which 
the strands bond to each other. Hydrogen bonds form between the base 
pairs. The number of bonds between the base pairs differs; G-C (guanine-
cytosine) pairs have three bonds, and A-T (adenine-thymine) pairs have only 
two. Figure 6-4 illustrates the structure of the untwisted double helix — spe-
cifically, the bonds between base pairs. Every DNA molecule has hundreds of 
thousands of base pairs, and each base pair has multiple bonds, so the rungs 
of the ladder are very strongly bonded together.

92
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
When inside a cell, the two strands of DNA gently twist around each other like 
a spiral staircase (or a strand of licorice, or the stripes on a candy cane . . . 
anybody else have a sweet tooth?). The antiparallel arrangement of the two 
strands is what causes the twist. Because the strands run in opposite direc-
tions, they pull the sides of the molecule in opposite directions, causing the 
whole thing to twist around itself.
Most naturally occurring DNA spirals clockwise, as you can see in Figure 
6-5. A full twist (or complete turn) occurs every ten base pairs or so, with 
the bases safely protected on the inside of the helix. The helical form is one 
way that the information that DNA carries is protected from damage that can 
result in mutation.
 
The helical form creates two grooves on the outside of the molecule (see 
Figure 6-5). The major groove actually lets the bases peep out a little, which 
is important when it’s time to read the information DNA contains (see 
Chapter 10).

Because base pairs in DNA are stacked on top of each other, chemical inter-
actions make the center of the molecule repel water. Molecules that repel 
water are called hydrophobic (Greek for “afraid of water”). The outside of the 
DNA molecule is just the opposite; it attracts water. The result is that the 
inside of the helix remains safe and dry while the outside is encased in a 
“shell” of water.

93
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
 
Here are a few additional details about DNA that you need to know:
 
✓ A DNA strand is measured by the number of base pairs it has.
 
✓ The sequence of bases in DNA isn’t random. The genetic information 
in DNA is carried in the order of the base pairs. In fact, the genes are 
encoded in the base sequences. Chapter 10 explains how the sequences 
are read and decoded.
 
✓ DNA uses a preexisting DNA strand as a pattern or template in the 
assembly process. DNA doesn’t just form on its own. The process of 
making a new strand of DNA using a preexisting strand is called replica-
tion. I cover replication in detail in Chapter 7.
Examining Different Varieties of DNA
All DNA has the same four bases, obeys the same base pairing rules, and has 
the same double helix structure. No matter where it’s found or what function 
it’s carrying out, DNA is DNA. That said, different sets of DNA exist within a 
single organism. These sets carry out different genetic functions. In this sec-
tion, I explain where the various DNAs are found and describe what they do.
Nuclear DNA
Nuclear DNA is DNA in cell nuclei, and it’s responsible for the majority of 
functions that cells carry out. Nuclear DNA carries codes for phenotype, the 
physical traits of an organism (for a review of genetics terms, see Chapter 3). 
Nuclear DNA is packaged into chromosomes and passed from parent to off-
spring (see Chapter 2). When scientists talk about sequencing the human 
genome, they mean human nuclear DNA. (A genome is a full set of genetic 
instructions; see Chapter 11 for more about the human genome.) The nuclear 
genome of humans is comprised of the DNA from all 24 chromosomes (22 
autosomes plus one X and one Y; see Chapter 2 for chromosome lingo).
Mitochondrial DNA
Animals, plants, and fungi all have mitochondria (for a review of cell parts, 
turn to Chapter 2). These powerhouses of the cell come with their own DNA, 
which is quite different in form (and inheritance) from nuclear DNA (see the 
preceding section). Each mitochondrion (the singular word for mitochondria) 
has many molecules of mitochondrial DNA — mtDNA, for short.

94
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Whereas human nuclear DNA is linear, mtDNA is circular (hoop-shaped). 
Human mtDNA is very short (slightly less than 17,000 base pairs) and has 37 
genes, which account for almost the entire mtDNA molecule. These genes 
control cellular metabolism — the processing of energy inside the cell.
Half of your nuclear DNA came from your mom, and the other half came from 
your dad (see Chapter 2 for the scoop on how meiosis divides up chromo-
somes). But all your mtDNA came from your mom. All your mom’s mtDNA 
came from her mom, and so on. All mtDNA is passed from mother to child in 
the cytoplasm of the egg cell (go to Chapter 2 for cell review).
 
Sperm cells have essentially no cytoplasm and thus, virtually no mitochon-
dria. Special chemicals in the egg destroy the few mitochondria that sperm do 
possess.
Chloroplast DNA
Plants have three sets of DNA: nuclear in the form of chromosomes, mito-
chondrial, and chloroplast DNA (cpDNA). Chloroplasts are organelles found 
only in plants, and they’re where photosynthesis (the conversion of light to 
Mighty mitochondria
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) bears a strong 
resemblance to a bacterial DNA. The striking 
similarities between mitochrondria and a cer-
tain bacteria called Rickettsia have led scien-
tists to believe that mitochrondria originated 
from Rickettsia. Rickettsia causes typhus, a 
flu-like disease transmitted by flea bites (the 
flea first bites an infected rat or mouse and 
then bites a person). As for the similarities, nei-
ther Rickettsia nor mitochondria can live out-
side a cellular home, both have circular DNA, 
and both share similar DNA sequences (see 
Chapter 8 for how DNA sequences are com-
pared between organisms). Instead of being 
parasitic like Rickettsia, however, mitochondria 
are considered endosymbiotic, meaning they 
must be inside a cell to work (endo-) and they 
provide something good to the cell (-symbiotic). 
In this case, the something good is energy.
Because mtDNA is passed only from mother 
to child (see the earlier section “Mitochondrial 
DNA” for an explanation), scientists have com-
pared mtDNA from people all over the world 
to investigate the origins of modern humans. 
These comparisons have led some scientists to 
believe that all modern humans have one par-
ticular female ancestor in common, a woman 
who lived on the African continent about 
200,000 years ago. This hypothetical woman 
has been called “Mitochondrial Eve,” but she 
wasn’t the only woman of her time. There were 
many women, but apparently, none of their 
descendants survived, making Eve what sci-
entists refer to as our “most recent common 
ancestor,” or MRCA. Some evidence suggests 
that all humans are descended from a rather 
small population of about 100,000 individuals, 
meaning that all people on earth have common 
ancestry.

95
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
chemical energy) occurs. To complicate matters, plants have mitochondria 
(and thus mtDNA) in their chloroplasts. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts 
probably originated from bacteria (see the sidebar “Mighty mitochondria”).
Chloroplast DNA molecules are circular and fairly large (120,000–160,000 
base pairs) but only have about 120 genes. Most of those genes supply infor-
mation used to carry out photosynthesis. Inheritance of cpDNA can be either 
maternal or paternal, and cpDNA, along with mtDNA, is transmitted to off-
spring in the cytoplasm of the seed.
Digging into the History of DNA
Back when Mendel was poking around his pea pods in the early 1860s (see 
Chapter 3), neither he nor anybody else knew about DNA. DNA was discov-
ered in 1868, but its importance as the genetic material wasn’t appreciated 
until nearly a century later. This section gives you a rundown on how DNA 
and its role in inheritance was revealed.
Discovering DNA
 
In 1868, a Swiss medical student named Johann Friedrich Miescher isolated 
DNA for the first time. Miescher was working with white blood cells that he 
obtained from the pus drained out of surgical wounds (yes, this man was dedi-
cated to his work). Eventually, Miescher established that the substance he 
called nuclein was rich in phosphorus and was acidic. Thus, one of his stu-
dents renamed the substance nucleic acid, a name DNA still carries today. Like 
Mendel’s findings on the inheritance of various plant traits, Miescher’s work 
wasn’t recognized for its importance until long after his death, and it took 84 
years for DNA to be recognized as the genetic material. Until the early 1950s, 
everyone was sure that protein had to be the genetic material because, with 
only four bases, DNA seemed too simple.
In 1928, Frederick Griffith recognized that bacteria could acquire something — 
he wasn’t quite sure what — from each other to transform harmless bacteria 
into deadly bacteria (see Chapter 22 for the whole story). A team of scientists 
led by Oswald Avery followed up on Griffith’s experiments and determined that 
the “transforming principle” was DNA. Even though Avery’s results were solid, 
scientists of the time were skeptical about the significance of DNA’s role in 
inheritance. It took another elegant set of experiments using a virus that infected 
bacteria to convince the scientific community that DNA was the real deal.
 
Alfred Chase and Martha Hershey worked with a virus called a bacteriophage 
(which means “eats bacteria,” even though the virus actually ruptures the 
bacteria rather than eats it). Bacteriophages grab onto the bacteria’s cell wall 
and inject something into the bacteria. At the time of Hershey and Chase’s 

96
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
experiment, the injected substance was unidentified. The bacteriophage pro-
duces its offspring inside the cell and then bursts the cell wall open to free the 
viral “offspring.” Offspring carry the same traits as the original attacking bac-
teriophage, so it was certain that whatever got injected must be the genetic 
material, given that most of the bacteriophage stays stuck on the outside of 
the cell. Hershey and Chase attached radioactive chemicals to track different 
parts of the bacteriophage; for example, they used sulfur to track protein, 
because proteins contain sulfur, and DNA was marked with phosphorus 
(because of the sugar-phosphate backbone). Hershey and Chase reasoned 
that offspring bacteriophages would get marked with one or the other, 
depending on which — DNA or protein — turned out to be the genetic mate-
rial. The results showed that the viruses injected only DNA into the bacterial 
cell to infect it. All the protein stayed stuck on the outside of the bacterial cell. 
They published their findings in 1952, when Hershey was merely 24 years old!
Obeying Chargaff’s rules
Long before Hershey and Chase published their pivotal findings, Erwin 
Chargaff read Oswald Avery’s paper on DNA as the transforming principle 
(see Chapter 22) and immediately changed the focus of his entire research 
program. Unlike many scientists of his day, Chargaff recognized that DNA was 
the genetic material.
 
Chargaff focused his research on learning as much as he could about the chem-
ical components of DNA. Using DNA from a wide variety of organisms, he dis-
covered that all DNA had something in common: When DNA was broken into 
its component bases, the amount of guanine fluctuated wildly from one organ-
ism to another, but the amount of guanine always equaled the amount of cyto-
sine. Likewise, in every organism he studied, the amount of adenine equaled 
the amount of thymine. Published in 1949, these findings are so consistent that 
they’re called Chargaff’s rules. Unfortunately, Chargaff was unable to realize the 
meaning of his own work. He knew that the ratios said something important 
about the structure of DNA, but he couldn’t figure out what that something 
was. It took a pair of young scientists named Watson and Crick — Chargaff 
called them “two pitchmen in search of a helix” — to make the breakthrough.
Hard feelings and the helix: Franklin, 
Wilkins, Watson, and Crick
 
If you don’t know the name Rosalind Franklin, you should. Her data on the 
shape of the DNA molecule revealed its structure as a double helix. Watson 
and Crick get all the credit for identifying the double helix, but Franklin did 
much of the work. While researching the structure of DNA at King’s College, 

97
 Chapter 6: DNA: The Basis of Life
London, in the early 1950s, Franklin bounced X-rays off the molecule to pro-
duce incredibly sharp, detailed photos of it. Franklin’s photos show a DNA mol-
ecule from the end, not the side, so it’s difficult to envision the side view of the 
double helix you normally see. Yet Franklin knew she was looking at a helix.
Meanwhile, James Watson, a 23-year-old postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge, 
England, was working with a 38-year-old graduate student named Francis 
Crick. Together, they were building an enormous model of metal sticks and 
wooden balls, trying to figure out the structure of the same molecule Franklin 
had photographed.
Franklin was supposed to be collaborating with Maurice Wilkins, another 
scientist in her research group, but she and Wilkins despised each other 
(because of a switch in research projects in which Franklin was instructed 
to take over Wilkins’s project without his knowledge). As their antagonism 
grew, so did Wilkins’s friendship with Watson. What happened next is the 
stuff of science infamy. Just a few weeks before Franklin was ready to publish 
her findings, Wilkins showed Franklin’s photographs of the DNA molecule to 
Watson — without her knowledge or permission! By giving Watson access to 
Franklin’s data, Wilkins gave Watson and Crick the scoop on the competition.
Watson and Crick cracked the mystery of DNA structure using Chargaff’s 
rules (see the section “Obeying Chargaff’s rules” for details) and Franklin’s 
measurements of the molecule. They deduced that the structure revealed by 
Franklin’s photo, hastily drawn from memory by Watson, had to be a double 
helix, and Chargaff’s rules pointed to bases in pairs. The rest of the structure 
came together like a big puzzle, and they rushed to publish their discovery 
in 1953. Franklin’s paper, complete with the critical photos of the DNA mol-
ecule, was published in the same issue of the journal Nature.
In 1962, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins were honored with the Nobel Prize. 
Franklin wasn’t properly credited for her part in their discovery but couldn’t 
protest because she had died of ovarian cancer in 1957. It’s quite possible 
that Franklin’s cancer was the result of long-term exposure to X-rays during 
her scientific career. In a sense, Franklin sacrificed her life for science.

Replication: Copying Your DNA
In This Chapter
▶ Uncovering the pattern for copying DNA
▶ Putting together a new DNA molecule
▶ Revealing how circular DNA molecules replicate
E
verything in genetics relies on replication — the process of copying DNA 
accurately, quickly, and efficiently. Replication is part of reproduction 
(producing eggs and sperm), development (making all the cells needed by 
a growing embryo), and maintaining normal life (replacing skin, blood, and 
muscle cells).
Before meiosis can occur (see Chapter 2), the entire genome must be repli-
cated so that a potential parent can make the eggs or sperm necessary for 
creating offspring. After fertilization occurs, the growing embryo must have 
the right genetic instructions in every cell to make all the tissues needed for 
life. As life outside the womb goes on, almost every cell in your body needs 
a copy of the entire genome to ensure that the genes that carry out the busi-
ness of living are present and ready for action. For example, because you’re 
constantly replacing your skin cells and white blood cells, your DNA is being 
replicated right now so that your cells have the genes they need to work 
properly.
This chapter explains all the details of the fantastic molecular photocopier 
that allows DNA — the stuff of life — to do its job. First, you tackle the basics 
of how DNA’s structure provides a pattern for copying itself. Then, you find 
out about all the enzymes — those helpful protein workhorses — that do the 
labor of opening up the double-stranded DNA and assembling the building 
blocks of DNA into a new strand. Finally, you see how the copying process 
works, from beginning (origins) to ends (telomeres).

100
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Unzipped: Creating the 
Pattern for More DNA
DNA is the ideal material for carrying genetic information because it
 
✓ Stores vast amounts of complex information (genotype) that can be 
“translated” into physical characteristics (phenotype)
 
✓ Can be copied quickly and accurately
 
✓ Is passed down from one generation to the next (in other words, it’s 
heritable)
 
When James D. Watson and Francis Crick proposed the double helix as the 
structure of DNA (see Chapter 6 for coverage of DNA), they ended their 1953 
paper with a pithy sentence about replication. That one little sentence paved 
the way for their next major publication, which hypothesized how replication 
may work. It’s no accident that Watson and Crick won the Nobel Prize; their 
genius was uncanny and amazingly accurate. Without their discovery of the 
double helix, they never could’ve figured out replication, because the trick 
that DNA pulls off during replication depends entirely on how DNA is put 
together in the first place.
 
If you skipped Chapter 6, which focuses on how DNA is put together, you may 
want to skim over that material now. The main points about DNA you need to 
know to understand replication are:
 
✓ DNA is double-stranded.
 
✓ The nucleotide building blocks of DNA always match up in a complemen-
tary fashion — A (adenosine) with T (thymine) and C (cytosine) with G 
(guanine).
 
✓ DNA strands run antiparallel (that is, in opposite directions) to each 
other.
 
If you were to unzip a DNA molecule by breaking all the hydrogen bonds 
between the bases, you’d have two strands, and each would provide the pat-
tern to create the other. During replication, special helper chemicals called 
enzymes bring matching (complementary) nucleotide building blocks to pair 
with the bases on each strand. The result is two exact copies built on the tem-
plates that the unzipped original strands provide.
Figure 7-1 shows how the original double-stranded DNA supplies a template to 
make copies of itself. This mode of replication is called semiconservative. No, 
this isn’t how DNA may vote in the next election! In this case, semiconservative

means that only half the molecule is “conserved,” or left in its original state. 
(Conservative, in the genetic sense, means keeping something protected in its 
original state.)

Newly Replicated
 
At Columbia University in 1957, J. Herbert Taylor, Philip Woods, and Walter 
Hughes used the cell cycle to determine how DNA is copied (see Chapter 2 for 
a review of mitosis and the cell cycle). They came up with two possibilities: 
conservative or semiconservative replication.
Figure 7-2 shows how conservative replication may work. For both conserva-
tive and semiconservative replication, the original, double-stranded molecule 
comes apart and provides the template for building new strands. The result 
of semiconservative replication is two complete, double-stranded molecules, 
each composed of half “new” and half “old” DNA (which is what you see in 
Figure 7-1). Following conservative replication, the complete, double-stranded 
copies are composed of all “new” DNA, and the templates come back together 
to make one molecule composed of “old” DNA (as you can see in Figure 7-2).

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
To sort out replication, Taylor and his colleagues exposed the tips of a 
plant’s roots to water that contained a radioactive chemical. This chemical 
was a form of the nucleotide building block thymine, which is found in DNA. 
Before cells in the root tips divided, their chromosomes incorporated the 
radioactive thymine as part of newly replicated DNA. In the first step of the 
experiment, Taylor and his team let the root tips grow for eight hours. That 
was just long enough for the DNA of the cells in the growing tips to replicate. 
The researchers collected some cells after this first step to see whether one 
or both sister chromatids of each chromosome were radioactive. Then, for 
the second step, they put the root tips in water with no radioactive chemi-
cal in it. After the cells started dividing, Taylor and his team examined the 
replicated chromosomes while they were in metaphase (when the replicated 
chromosomes, called sister chromatids, are all lined up together in the center 
of the cell, before they’re pulled apart to opposite ends of the soon-to-divide 
cell; see Chapter 2).
The radioactivity allowed Taylor and his team to trace the fate of the tem-
plate strands after replication was completed and determine whether the 
strands stayed together with their copies (semiconservative) or not (conser-
vative). They examined the results of both steps of the experiment to ensure 
that their conclusions were accurate.
If replication was semiconservative, Taylor, Woods, and Hughes expected 
to find that one sister chromatid of the replicated chromosome would be 
radioactive and the other would be radiation-free — and that’s what they 
got. Figure 7-3 shows how their results ended up as they did. The shaded 
chromosomes represent the ones containing the radioactive thymine. After 
one round of replication in the presence of the radioactive thymine (Step 1 in 
Figure 7-3), the entire chromosome appears radioactive.
If Taylor and his team could have seen the DNA molecules themselves (as 
you do figuratively here), they would have known that one strand of each 
double-stranded molecule contained radioactive thymine and the other did 
not (the radioactive strands are depicted with a thicker line). After one round 
of replication without access to the radioactive thymine (Step 2 in Figure 7-3), 
one sister chromatid was radioactive, and the other was not. That’s because 
each strand from Step 1 provided a template for semiconservative replica-
tion: The radioactive strand provided one template, and the nonradioactive 
strand provided the other. After replication was completed, the templates 
remained paired with the new strands. This experiment showed conclusively 
that DNA replication is truly semiconservative — each replicated molecule of 
DNA is half “new” and half “old.”

How DNA Copies Itself
Replication occurs during interphase of each cell cycle, just before prophase 
in both mitosis and meiosis. If you skipped over Chapter 2, you may want 
to take a quick glance at it to get an idea of when replication occurs with 
respect to the life of a cell.
The process of replication follows a very specific order:
 
1. The helix is opened up to expose single strands of DNA.
 
2. Nucleotides are strung together to make new partner strands for the two 
original strands.
 
DNA replication was first studied in bacteria, which are prokaryotic (lacking 
cell nuclei). All nonbacterial life forms (including humans) are eukaryotes 
(composed of cells with nuclei). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication 
differ in a few ways. Basically, bacteria use slightly different versions of the 

104
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
same enzymes that eukaryotic cells use, and most of those enzymes have simi-
lar names. If you understand prokaryotic replication, which I explain in this 
section, you have enough background to understand the details of eukaryotic 
replication, too.
Most eukaryotic DNA is linear, whereas most bacterial DNA (and your mito-
chondrial DNA) is circular. The shape of the chromosome (an endless loop 
versus a string) doesn’t affect the process of replication at all. However, the 
shape means that circular DNAs have special problems to solve when repli-
cating their hoop-shaped chromosomes. See the section “How Circular DNAs 
Replicate” later in this chapter to find out more.
Meeting the replication crew
For successful replication, several players must be present:
 
✓ Template DNA, a double-stranded molecule that provides a pattern to 
copy
 
✓ Nucleotides, the building blocks necessary to make new DNA
 
✓ Enzymes and various proteins that do the unzipping and assembly 
work of replication, called DNA synthesis
Template DNA
In addition to the material earlier in this chapter detailing how the template 
DNA is replicated semiconservatively (see “Unzipped: Creating the Pattern 
for More DNA”), it’s vitally important for you to understand all the meanings 
of the term template.
 
✓ Every organism’s DNA exists in the form of chromosomes. Therefore, 
the chromosomes undergoing replication and the template DNA uses 
during replication are one and the same.
 
✓ Both strands of each double-stranded original molecule are copied, and 
therefore, each of the two strands serves as a template (that is, a pat-
tern) for replication.
 
The bases of the template DNA provide critical information needed for replica-
tion. Each new base of the newly replicated strand must be complementary 
(that is, an exact match; see Chapter 6 for more about the complementary 
nature of DNA) to the base opposite it on the template strand. Together, tem-
plate and replicated DNA (like you see in Figure 7-1) make two identical copies 
of the original, double-stranded molecule.

105
 Chapter 7: Replication: Copying Your DNA
Nucleotides
 
DNA is made up of thousands of nucleotides linked together in paired strands. 
(If you want more details about the chemical and physical constructions of 
DNA, flip to Chapter 6.) The nucleotide building blocks of DNA that come 
together during replication start in the form of deoxyribonucleoside triphos-
phates, or dNTPs, which are made up of
 
✓ A sugar (deoxyribose)
 
✓ One of four bases (adenine, guanine, thymine, or cytosine)
 
✓ Three phosphates
Figure 7-4 shows a dNTP being incorporated into a double-stranded DNA mol-
ecule. The dNTPs used in replication are very similar in chemical structure 
to the ones in double-stranded DNA (you can refer to Figure 6-3 in Chapter 6 
to compare a nucleotide to the dNTP in Figure 7-4). The key difference is the 
number of phosphate groups — each dNTP has three phosphates, and each 
nucleotide has one.
Take a look at the blowup of the dNTP in Figure 7-4. The three phosphate 
groups (the “tri-” part of the name) are at the top end (usually referred to 
as the 5-prime, or 5’) of the molecule. At the bottom left of the molecule, 
also known as the 3-prime (3’) spot, is a little tail made of an oxygen atom 
attached to a hydrogen atom (collectively called an OH group or a reactive 
group). The oxygen atom in the OH tail is present to allow a nucleotide in an 
existing DNA strand to hook up with a dNTP; multiple connections like this 
one eventually produce the long chain of DNA. (For details on the numbered 
points of a molecule, such as 5’ or 3’, see Chapter 6.)
When DNA is being replicated, the OH tail on the 3’ end of the last nucleotide 
in the chain reacts with the phosphates of a newly arrived dNTP (as shown 
in the right-hand part of Figure 7-4). Two of the dNTP’s three phosphates 
get chopped off, and the remaining phosphate forms a phosphodiester bond 
with the previously incorporated nucleotide (see Chapter 6 for all the details 
about phosphodiester bonds). Hydrogen bonds form between the base of 
the template strand and the complementary base of the dNTP (see Chapter 
6 for more on the bonds that form between bases). This reaction — losing 
two phosphates to form a phosphodiester bond and hydrogen bonding — 
converts the dNTP into a nucleotide. (The only real difference between dNTP 
and the nucleotide it becomes is the number of phosphates each carries.) 
Remember, the template DNA must be single-stranded for these reactions to 
occur (see “Splitting the helix” later in this chapter).
Each dNTP incorporated during replication must be complementary to the 
base it’s hooked up with on the template strand.

A nucleotide is a deoxyribose sugar, a base, and a phosphate joined together 
as a unit. A nucleotide is a nucleotide regardless of whether it’s part of a 
whole DNA molecule or not. A dNTP is also a nucleotide, just a special sort: a 
nucleotide triphosphate.
Enzymes
Replication can’t occur without the help of a huge suite of enzymes. Enzymes 
are chemicals that cause reactions. Generally, enzymes come in two flavors: 
those that put things together and those that take things apart. Both types 
are used during replication.
 
Although you can’t always tell the function of an enzyme (building or destroy-
ing) by its name, you can always identify enzymes because they end in -ase. 
The -ase suffix usually follows a reference to what the enzyme acts on. For 
example, the enzyme helicase acts on the helix of DNA to make it single-
stranded (helix + ase = helicase).
So many enzymes are used in replication that it’s hard to keep up with them 
all. However, the main players and their roles are:
 
✓ Helicase: Opens up the double helix
 
✓ Gyrase: Prevents the helix from forming knots

107
 Chapter 7: Replication: Copying Your DNA
 
✓ Primase: Lays down a short piece of RNA (a primer) to get replication 
started (see Chapter 8 for more on RNA)
 
✓ DNA polymerase: Adds dNTPs to build the new strand of DNA
 
✓ Ligase: Seals the gaps between newly replicated pieces of DNA
 
✓ Telomerase: Replicates the ends of chromosomes (the telomeres) — a 
very special job
 
Prokaryotes have 5 forms of DNA polymerase, and eukaryotes have at least 13 
forms. In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase III is the enzyme that performs replica-
tion. DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA. 
DNA polymerases II, IV, and V all work to repair damaged DNA and carry out 
proofreading activities. Eukaryotes use a whole different set of DNA polymer-
ases. (For more details on eukaryotic DNA replication, see the section 
“Replication in Eukaryotes” later in the chapter.)
Splitting the helix
DNA replication starts at very specific spots, called origins, along the double-
stranded template molecule. Bacterial chromosomes are so short (only about 4 
million base pairs; see Chapter 11) that only one origin for replication is needed. 
Copying bigger genomes would take far too long if each chromosome had only 
one origin, so to make the process of copying very rapid, human chromosomes 
each have thousands of origins. (See the section “Replication in Eukaryotes” 
later in this chapter for more details on how human DNA is replicated.)
Special proteins called initiators move along the double-stranded template 
DNA until they encounter a group of bases that are in a specific order. These 
bases represent the origin for replication; think of them as a road sign with 
the message: “Start replication here.” The initiator proteins latch onto the 
template at the origin by looping the helix around themselves like looping a 
string around your finger. The initiator proteins then make a very small open-
ing in the double helix.
Helicase (the enzyme that opens up the double helix) finds this opening and 
starts breaking the hydrogen bonds between the complementary template 
strands to expose a few hundred bases and split the helix open even wider. 
DNA has such a strong tendency to form double-strands that if another pro-
tein didn’t come along to hold the single strands exposed by helicase apart, 
they’d snap right back together again. These proteins, called single-stranded-
binding (SSB) proteins, prop the two strands apart so replication can occur. 
Figure 7-5 shows the whole process of replication. For now, focus on the 
part that shows how helicase breaks the strands apart as it moves along the 
double helix and how the strands are kept separated and untwisted.

108
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
If you’ve had any experience with yarn or fishing line, you know that if string 
gets twisted together and you try to pull the strands apart, a knot forms. This 
same problem occurs when opening up the double helix of DNA. When heli-
case starts pulling the two strands apart, the opening of the helix sends extra 
turns along the intact helix. To prevent DNA from ending up a knotty mess, an 
enzyme called gyrase comes along to relieve the tension. Exactly how gyrase 
does this is unclear, but some researchers think that gyrase actually snips the 
DNA apart temporarily to let the twisted parts relax and then seals the mole-
cule back together again.
Priming the pump
When helicase opens up the molecule, a Y forms at the opening. This Y is 
called a replication fork. You can see a replication fork in Figure 7-5, where 
the helicase has split the DNA helix apart. For every opening in the double-
stranded molecule, two forks form on opposite sides of the opening. DNA 
replication is very particular in that it can only proceed in one direction: 
5-prime to 3-prime (5’ → 3’). In Figure 7-5, the top strand runs 3’ → 5’ from left 
to right, and the bottom strand runs 5’ → 3’ (that is, the template strands are 
antiparallel; see Chapter 6 for more about the importance of the antiparallel 
arrangement of DNA strands).
 
Replication must proceed antiparallel to the template, running 5’ to 3’. 
Therefore, replication on the top strand runs right to left; on the bottom 
strand, replication runs left to right.
After helicase splits the molecule open (as I explain in the preceding section), 
two naked strands of template DNA are left. Replication can’t start on the 
naked template strands because it hasn’t started yet. (That sounds a bit like 
Yogi Berra saying “It ain’t over ’til it’s over,” doesn’t it?) All funny business 
aside, nucleotides can only form chains if a nucleotide is already present 
with a free reactive tail on which to attach the incoming dNTP. DNA solves 
the problem of starting replication by inserting primers, little complementary 
starter strands made of RNA (refer to Figure 7-5).
Primase, the enzyme that manufactures the RNA primers for replication, lays 
down primers at each replication fork so that DNA synthesis can proceed 
from 5’ → 3’ on both strands. The RNA primers made by primase are only 
about 10 or 12 nucleotides long. They’re complementary to the single strands 
of DNA and end with the same sort of OH tail found on a nucleotide of DNA. 
(To find out more about RNA, flip to Chapter 8.) DNA uses the primers’ free 
OH tails to add nucleotides in the form of dNTPs (see “Nucleotides” earlier in 
this chapter); the primers are later snipped out and replaced with DNA (see 
“Joining all the pieces” later in this chapter).

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Leading and lagging
As soon as the primers are in place, actual replication can get underway. DNA 
polymerase is the enzyme that does all the work of replication. At the OH tail 
of each primer, DNA polymerase tacks on dNTPs by snipping off two phos-
phates and forming phosphodiester bonds (see Chapter 6). Meanwhile, heli-
case opens up the helix ahead of the growing chain to expose more template 
strand. From Figure 7-5, it’s easy to see that replication can just zoom along 
this way — but only on one strand (in this case, the top strand in Figure 7-5). 
The replicated strands keep growing continuously 5’ → 3’ as helicase makes 
the template available.
At the same time, on the opposite strand, new primers have to be added to 
take advantage of the newly available template. The new primers are necessary 
because a naked strand (the bottom one in Figure 7-5) lacking the necessary 
free nucleotide for chain-building is created by the ongoing splitting of the helix.
Thus, the interaction of opening the helix and synthesizing DNA 5’ → 3’ on 
one strand while laying down new primers on the other leads to the forma-
tion of leading and lagging strands.
 
✓ Leading strands: The strands formed in one bout of uninterrupted DNA 
synthesis (you can see a leading strand in Figure 7-6). Leading strands 
follow the lead, so to speak, of helicase.
 
✓ Lagging strands: The strands that are begun over and over as new prim-
ers are laid down. Synthesis of the lagging strands stops when they 
reach the 5’ end of a primer elsewhere on the strand. Lagging strands 
“lag behind” leading strands in the sense of frequent starting and stop-
ping versus continuous replication. (Replication happens so rapidly that 
there’s no difference in the amount of time it takes to replicate leading 
and lagging strands.) The short pieces of DNA formed by lagging DNA 
synthesis have a special name: Okazaki fragments, named for the scien-
tist, Reiji Okazaki, who discovered them.
Joining all the pieces
After the template strands are replicated, the newly synthesized strands have 
to be modified to be complete and whole:
 
✓ The RNA primers must be removed and replaced with DNA.
 
✓ The Okazaki fragments formed by lagging DNA synthesis must be joined 
together.

As helicase continues to open the
molecule ahead of the leading strand,

5’

A special kind of DNA polymerase moves along the newly synthesized 
strands seeking out the RNA primers. When DNA polymerase encounters the 
short bits of RNA, it snips them out and replaces them with DNA. (Refer to 
Figure 7-5 for an illustration of this process.) The snipping out and replacing 
of RNA primers proceeds in the usual 5’ → 3’ direction of replication and fol-
lows the same procedures as normal DNA synthesis (adding dNTPs and form-
ing phosphodiester bonds).
After the primers are removed and replaced, one phosphodiester bond is 
missing between the Okazaki fragments. Ligase is the enzyme that seals these 
little gaps (ligate means to join things together). Ligase has the special ability 
to form phosphodiester bonds without adding a new nucleotide.
Proofreading replication
Despite its complexity, replication is unbelievably fast. In humans, replica-
tion speeds along at about 2,000 bases a minute. Bacterial replication is even 
faster at about 1,000 bases per second! Working at that speed, it’s really no 
surprise that DNA polymerase makes mistakes — about one in every 100,000 
bases is incorrect. Fortunately, DNA polymerase can use the backspace key!
DNA polymerase constantly checks its work though a process called 
proofreading — the same way I proofread my work as I wrote this book. 
DNA polymerase looks over its shoulder, so to speak, and keeps track of 
how well the newly added bases fit with the template strand. If an incorrect 
base is added, DNA polymerase backs up and cuts the incorrect base out. 
The snipping process is called exonuclease activity, and the correction 

112
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
process requires DNA polymerase to move 3’ → 5’ instead of the usual 
5’ → 3’ direction. DNA proofreading eliminates most of the mistakes made 
by DNA polymerase, and the result is nearly error-free DNA synthesis. 
Generally, replication (after proofreading) has an astonishingly low error 
rate of one in 10 million base pairs.
If DNA polymerase misses an incorrect base, special enzymes come along 
after replication is complete to carry out another process, called mismatch 
repair (much like my editors checked my proofreading). The mismatch repair 
enzymes detect the bulges that occur along the helix when noncomplemen-
tary bases are paired up, and the enzymes snip the incorrect base out of the 
newly synthesized strand. These enzymes replace the incorrect base with the 
correct one and, like ligase, seal up the gaps to finish the repair job.
Replication is a complicated process that uses a dizzying array of enzymes. 
The key points to remember are:
 
✓ Replication always starts at an origin.
 
✓ Replication can only occur when template DNA is single-stranded.
 
✓ RNA primers must be put down before replication can proceed.
 
✓ Replication always moves 5’ → 3’.
 
✓ Newly synthesized strands are exact complementary matches to tem-
plate (“old”) strands.
Replication in Eukaryotes
Although replication in prokaryotes and eukaryotes is very similar, you need 
to know about four differences:
 
✓ For each of their chromosomes, eukaryotes have many, many origins 
for replication. Prokaryotes generally have one origin per circular 
chromosome.
 
✓ The enzymes that prokaryotes and eukaryotes use for replication are 
similar but not identical. Compared to prokaryotes, eukaryotes have 
many more DNA polymerases, and these DNA polymerases carry out 
other functions besides replication.
 
✓ Linear chromosomes, found in eukaryotes, require special enzymes to 
replicate the telomeres — the ends of chromosomes.
 
✓ Eukaryotic chromosomes are tightly wound around special proteins in 
order to package large amounts of DNA into very small cell nuclei.

113
 Chapter 7: Replication: Copying Your DNA
Pulling up short: Telomeres
When linear chromosomes replicate, the ends of the chromosomes, called 
telomeres, present special challenges. These challenges are handled in dif-
ferent ways depending on what kind of cell division is taking place (that is, 
mitosis versus meiosis).
At the completion of replication for cells in mitosis, a short part of the telo-
mere tips is left single-stranded and unreplicated. A special enzyme comes 
along and snips off this unreplicated part of the telomere. Losing this bit of 
DNA at the end of the chromosome isn’t as big a deal as it may seem, because 
telomeres, in addition to being the ends of chromosomes, are long strings 
of junk DNA. Junk DNA doesn’t contain genes but may have other important 
functions (see Chapter 11 for the details).
For telomeres, being junk DNA is good because when telomeres get snipped 
off, the chromosomes aren’t damaged too much and the genes still work 
just fine — up to a point. After many rounds of replication, all the junk 
DNA at the ends of the chromosomes is snipped off (essentially, the chro-
mosomes run out of junk DNA), and actual genes themselves are affected. 
Therefore, when the chromosomes of a mitotic cell (like a skin cell, for 
example) get too short, the cell dies through a process called apoptosis. (I 
cover apoptosis in detail in Chapter 14.) Paradoxically, cell death through 
apoptosis is a good thing because it protects you from the ravages of muta-
tions, which can cause cancer.
If the cell is being divided as part of meiosis, telomere snipping is not okay. 
The telomeres must be replicated completely so that perfectly complete, full-
size chromosomes are passed on to offspring. An enzyme called telomerase 
takes care of replicating the ends of the chromosomes. Figure 7-7 gives you 
an idea of how telomerase replicates telomeres. Primase lays down a primer 
at the very tip of the chromosome as part of the normal replication process. 
DNA synthesis proceeds from 5’ → 3’ as usual, and then, a DNA polymerase 
comes along and snips out the RNA primer from 5’ → 3’. Without telomerase, 
the process stops, leaving a tail of unreplicated, single-stranded DNA flapping 
around (this is what happens during mitosis).
Telomerase easily detects the unreplicated telomere because telomeres have 
long sections of guanines, or Gs. Telomerase contains a section of cytosine-
rich RNA, allowing the enzyme to bind to the unreplicated, guanine-rich 
telomere. Telomerase then uses its own RNA to extend the unreplicated DNA 
template by about 15 nucleotides. Scientists suspect that the single-stranded 
template then folds back on itself to provide a free OH tail to replicate the 
rest of the telomere in the absence of a primer (see “Priming the pump” ear-
lier in this chapter).

Finishing the job
Your DNA (and that of all eukaryotes) is tightly wound around special struc-
tures called nucleosomes (not to be confused with nucleotides) so that the 
enormous molecule fits neatly into the cell nucleus. (See Chapter 6 for the 
details on just how big a molecule of DNA really is.) Like replication, packag-
ing DNA is a very rapid process. It happens so quickly that scientists aren’t 
exactly sure how DNA gets unwrapped from the nucleosomes to replicate 
and then gets wrapped around the nucleosomes again.
In the packaging stage, DNA is normally twisted tightly around hundreds of 
thousands of nucleosomes, much like string wrapped around beads. The whole 
“necklace” gets wound very tightly around itself in a process called supercoil-
ing. Supercoiling is what allows the 3.5 billion base pairs of DNA that make 
up your 46 chromosomes to fit inside the microscopic nuclei of your cells. 
Altogether, about 150 base pairs of DNA are wrapped around each nucleosome 
and secured in place with a little protein called a histone. In Figure 7-8, you can 
see the nucleosomes, histones, and supercoiled “necklace.”
DNA is packaged in this manner both before and after replication. Because 
only 30 or 40 base pairs of DNA are exposed between nucleosomes, the 
DNA must be removed from the nucleosomes in order to replicate. If it isn’t 
removed from the nuclesomes, the enzymes used in replication aren’t able to 
access the entire molecule.
 
As helicase opens up the DNA molecule during replication, an unidentified 
enzyme strips off the nucleosome beads at the same time. As soon as the DNA 
is replicated, the DNA (both old and new) is immediately wrapped around 
waiting nucleosomes. Studies show that the old nucleosomes (from before 
replication) are reused along with newly assembled nucleosomes to package 
the freshly replicated DNA molecule.

How Circular DNAs Replicate
Circular DNAs are replicated in three different ways, as shown in Figure 
7-9. Different organisms take different approaches to solve the problem of 
replicating hoop-shaped chromosomes. Theta replication is used by most 
bacteria, including E. coli. Viruses use rolling circle replication to rapidly 
manufacture vast numbers of copies of their genomes. Finally, human mito-
chondrial DNA and the chloroplast DNA of plants both use D-loop replication.
Theta
Theta replication refers to the shape the chromosome takes on during the 
replication process. After the helix splits apart, a bubble forms, giving the 
chromosome a shape reminiscent of the Greek letter theta (Θ; see Figure 7-9). 
Bacterial chromosomes have only one origin of replication (see “Splitting the 
helix”), so after helicase opens the double helix, replication proceeds in both 
directions simultaneously, rapidly copying the entire molecule. As I describe 
in the section “Leading and lagging,” leading and lagging strands form, and 
ligase seals the gaps in the newly synthesized DNA to complete the strands. 
Ultimately, theta replication produces two intact, double-stranded molecules.

Rolling circle
Rolling circle replication creates an odd situation. No primer is needed 
because the double-stranded template is broken at the origin to provide a 
free OH tail to start replication. As replication proceeds, the inner strand 
is copied continuously as a leading strand (refer to Figure 7-9). Meanwhile, 
the broken strand is stripped off. As soon as enough of the broken strand is 
freed, a primer is laid down so replication can occur as the broken strand 
is stripped away from its complement. Thus, rolling circle replication is 
continuous on one strand and lagging on the other. As soon as replication is 
completed for one copy of the genome, the new copies are used as templates 
for additional rounds of replication. Viral genomes are often very small (only 
a few thousand base pairs), so rolling circle replication is an extremely rapid 
process that produces hundreds of thousands of copies of viral DNA in only a 
few minutes.
D-loop
Like rolling circle replication, D-loop replication creates a displaced, single 
strand (refer to Figure 7-9). Helicase opens the double-stranded molecule, 
and an RNA primer is laid down, displacing one strand. Replication then 
proceeds around the circle, pushing the displaced strand off as it goes. The 
intact, single strand is released and used as a template to synthesize a com-
plementary strand.

magine owning a library of 22,000 books. I don’t mean just any books; this 
collection contains unimaginable knowledge, such as solutions to diseases 
that have plagued humankind for centuries, basic building instructions for 
just about every creature on earth, and even the explanation of how thoughts 
are formed inside your brain. This fabulous library has only one problem — 
it’s written in a mysterious language, a code made up of only four letters that 
are repeated in arcane patterns. The very secrets of life on earth have been 
contained within this library since the dawn of time, but no one could read 
the books — until now.
The 22,000 books are the genes that carry the information that make you. 
The library storing these books is the human genome. Sequencing genomes 
(that is, all the DNA in one set of chromosomes of an organism), both human 
genomes and those of other organisms, means discovering the order of the 
four bases (C, G, A, and T) that make up DNA. The order of the bases in DNA 
is incredibly important because it’s the key to DNA’s language, and under-
standing the language is the first step in reading the books of the library. 
Most of your genes are identical to those in other species, so sequencing the 
DNA of other organisms, such as fruit flies, roundworms, chickens, and even 
yeast, supplies scientists with a lot of information about the human genome 
and how human genes function.
Trying on a Few Genomes
Humans are incredibly complex organisms, but when it comes to genetics, 
they’re not at the top of the heap. Many complex organisms have vastly larger 
genomes than humans do. Genomes are usually measured in the number 
of base pairs they contain (flip to Chapter 6 for more about how DNA is put 
together in base pairs). Table 8-1 lists the genome sizes and estimated number 

118
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
of genes for various organisms (for some genomes, like grasshoppers, the 
numbers of genes are still unknown). Human genome size runs a distant fifth 
behind salamanders, amoebas, and grasshoppers. It’s humbling, but true — a 
single-celled amoeba has a gigantic genome of over 670 billion base pairs. If 
genome size and complexity were related (and they obviously aren’t), you’d 
expect the amoeba to have a small genome compared to more complex organ-
isms. On the flip side, it doesn’t take a lot of DNA to have a big impact on the 
world. For example, the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, is a mere 9,700 bases 
long and is responsible for the deaths of over 25 million people worldwide. 
With only nine genes, HIV isn’t very complex, but it’s still very dangerous.
Even organisms that are very similar have vastly different genome sizes. Fruit 
flies have roughly 180 million base pairs of DNA. Compare that to the grass-
hopper genome, which weighs in at a whopping 180 billion base pairs. But 
fruit flies and grasshoppers aren’t that different. So if it isn’t organism com-
plexity, what causes the differences in genome size among organisms?

Part of what accounts for the variation in genome size from one organism to 
the next is number of chromosomes. Particularly in plants, the number of 
chromosome sets (called ploidy; see Chapter 15) explains why some plant 
species have very large genome sizes. For example, wheat is hexaploid (six 
copies of each chromosome) and has a gigantic genome of 16 billion base 
pairs. Rice, on the other hand, is diploid (two copies of each chromosome) 
and has a mere 430 million base pairs.

119
 Chapter 8: Sequencing Your DNA
Chromosome number doesn’t tell the whole story, however. The number of 
genes within a genome doesn’t reveal how big the genome is. Arguably, mice 
are somewhat more complex than corn, but they have at least 27,000 fewer 
genes! On top of that, the mouse genome is larger than the corn genome by 
about a million base pairs. What the human genome has that the mustard 
weed genome may lack is lots of repetition.
DNA sequences fall into two major categories:
 
✓ Unique sequences found in genes (I cover genes in Chapter 11)
 
✓ Repetitive sequences that make up noncoding DNA
 
The presence of repetitive sequences of DNA in some organisms seems to best 
explain genome size — that is, large genomes have many repeated sequences 
that smaller genomes lack. Repetitive sequences vary from 150 to 300 base 
pairs in length and are repeated thousands and thousands of times. These big 
chunks of sequences don’t code for proteins, though. Because, at least initially, 
all this repetitive DNA didn’t seem to do anything, it was dubbed junk DNA.
 
Junk DNA has suffered a bum rap. For years, it was touted as a genetic loser, 
just along for the ride, doing nothing except getting passed on from one gener-
ation to the next. But no more. At long last, so-called junk DNA is getting 
proper respect. Scientists realized quite some time ago that a lot of DNA 
besides genes gets transcribed into RNA (see Chapter 9 for more on the tran-
scription process). But after being transcribed, this noncoding “junk” didn’t 
appear to be translated into protein (see Chapter 10 for more on the transla-
tion process). New evidence suggests that repeated sequences control tran-
scription. A recent study identified 200,000 transcription start sites within 
repetitive DNA in the human and mouse genomes, suggesting that “junk” DNA 
may turn out to be the most important part of the genome, controlling every-
thing from how organisms develop as embryos to what color your eyes are.
Sequencing Your Way to 
the Human Genome
One of the ways scientists figure out what functions various kinds of 
sequences carry out is by comparing genomes of different organisms. To 
make these comparisons, the projects I describe in this section use the meth-
ods I explain in the section “Sequencing: Reading the Language of DNA” later 
in this chapter. The results of these comparisons tell us a lot about ourselves 
and the world around us.
The DNA of all organisms holds a vast amount of information. Amazingly, 
most cell functions work the same, regardless of which animal the cell comes 
from. Yeast, elephants, and humans all replicate DNA in the same way, using 

120
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
almost identical genes. Because nature uses the same genetic machinery over 
and over, finding out about the DNA sequences in other organisms tells us 
a lot about the human genome (and it’s far easier to experiment with yeast 
and roundworms than with humans). Table 8-2 is a timeline of the major mile-
stones of DNA sequencing projects so far. In this section, you find out about 
several of these projects, including the granddaddy of them all, the Human 
Genome Project.

The yeast genome
Brewer’s yeast (scientific name Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was the first 
eukaryotic genome to be fully sequenced. (Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei; 
see Chapter 2.) Yeast has an established track record as one of the most 
useful organisms known to humankind. It’s responsible for making bread 
rise and for the fermentation that results in beer and wine. It’s also a favorite 
organism for genetic study. Much of what we know about the eukaryotic cell 
cycle (see Chapter 2) came from yeast research. Yeast has provided informa-
tion about how genes are inherited together (called linkage; see Chapter 4) 

121
 Chapter 8: Sequencing Your DNA
and how genes are turned on and off (see Chapter 10). Because many human 
genes have yeast counterparts, yeast is extremely valuable for finding out 
how our own genes work.
Yeast has roughly 6,000 genes and 16 chromosomes. Altogether, about 70 
percent of the yeast genome consists of actual genes. Yeast genes work in 
neighborhoods to carry out their functions; genes that are physically close 
together on chromosomes are more likely to work together than those that 
are far apart. The discovery of gene networks in yeast may help researchers 
better understand what causes complex diseases such as Alzheimer’s dis-
ease, diabetes, and lupus in humans. Disorders such as these aren’t typically 
inherited in simple Mendelian fashion (see Chapter 3) and are likely to be 
controlled by many genes working together.
 
The sequencing of the yeast genome was quite a feat. Over 600 researchers in 
100 laboratories across the world participated in the project. The technology 
used at the time was much slower than what’s available to researchers now 
(see the sidebar “Open access and the Human Genome Project” for details). 
Despite the technological disadvantage, the sequence that this phenomenal 
team of scientists produced was extremely accurate — especially when com-
pared to the human genome (see “The Human Genome Project” section later 
in this chapter).
The elegant roundworm genome
The genome of the lowly roundworm, more properly referred to by its full 
name Caenorhabditis elegans, was the first genome of a multicellular organism 
to be fully sequenced. Weighing in at roughly 97 million base pairs, the round-
worm boasts nearly 20,000 genes — only a few thousand fewer than the human 
genome — on just six chromosomes. Like humans, roundworms have lots of 
junk DNA; only 25 percent of the roundworm genome is made up of genes.
Roundworms are a fabulous species to study because they reproduce sexu-
ally and have organ systems, such as digestive and nervous systems, similar 
to those in much more complex organisms. Additionally, roundworms have 
a sense of taste, can detect odors, and react to light and temperature, so 
they’re ideal for studying all sorts of processes, including behavior. Full-
grown roundworms have exactly 959 cells and are transparent, so figuring 
out how their cells work was relatively easy. Scientists determined the exact 
function of each of the 959 roundworm cells! Although roundworms live in 
soil, these microscopic organisms have contributed to our understanding of 
many human diseases.
 
One of the ways to discover what a gene does is to stop it from functioning 
and observe the effect. In 2003, a group of researchers fed roundworms a par-
ticular kind of RNA that temporarily puts gene function on hold (see Chapter 
10 for how this effect on gene function works). By briefly turning genes off, the 

122
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
scientists were able to determine the functions of roughly 16,000 of the round-
worms’ genes. Another study using the same technique identified how fat stor-
age and obesity are controlled in roundworms. Given that an amazing 70 
percent of proteins that humans produce have roundworm counterparts, 
these gene function studies have obvious implications for human medicine.
The chicken genome
Chickens don’t get enough respect. The study of chicken biology has 
revealed much about how organisms develop from embryos to adults. For 
example, a study of how a chicken’s wings and legs are formed in the egg 
greatly enhanced a study of human limb formation. Chickens have contrib-
uted to our understanding of diseases such as muscular dystrophy and 
epilepsy, and chicken eggs are the principal ingredient used to produce vac-
cinations to fight human disease epidemics. So when the chicken genome 
was sequenced in 2004, there should have been a lot of crowing about the 
underappreciated chicken.
The chicken genome is really different from mouse and human genomes. It’s 
much smaller (about a third as big as the human genome), with fewer chro-
mosomes (39 compared to our 46) and a similar number of genes (23,000 or 
so). Roughly 60 percent of chicken genes have human counterparts. Unlike 
mammals, some chicken chromosomes are tiny (only about 5 million base 
pairs). These micro-chromosomes are unique because they have a very high 
content of guanine and cytosine (see Chapter 6 for more about the bases that 
make up DNA) and very few repetitive sequences.
Not surprisingly, chickens have lots of genes that code for keratin — the stuff 
that makes their feathers (and your hair). The big surprise regarding the com-
pleted chicken genome was that chickens have lots of genes for sense of smell. 
Until recently, scientists thought that most birds have a really poor sense of 
smell. Now, they realize that sense of taste is what birds lack. The chicken 
genome also revealed that a particular gene previously known only to exist in 
humans is also present in chickens. This gene, called interleukin 26, is important 
in immune responses and may allow researchers to better understand how to 
fight disease. One disease they’re particularly interested in is avian flu which is 
often deadly to humans but doesn’t make birds sick. Ultimately, comparing the 
chicken and human genomes may allow scientists to understand how and why 
diseases like the “bird flu” move so easily between chickens and humans.
The Human Genome Project
In 2001, the triumphant publication of the human genome sequence 
was heralded as one of the great feats of modern science. The sequence 
was considered a draft, and indeed, it was a really rough draft. The 2001 

123
 Chapter 8: Sequencing Your DNA
sequence was woefully incomplete (it represented only about 60 percent 
of the total human genome) and was full of errors that limited its utility. In 
2004, the euchromatic (or gene-containing) sequence had only a few gaps, 
and most of the errors had been corrected. By 2008, new technologies 
allowed comparisons between individual humans, laying the foundation for 
a better understanding of how genes vary to create the endless phenotypes 
you see around you.
 
The Human Genome Project (HGP) is akin to some of the greatest adventures 
of all time — it’s not unlike putting a person on the moon. However, unlike the 
great technological achievements of space exploration, which cost tens of bil-
lions of dollars and require technology that becomes obsolete or wears out, 
the HGP carries a mere $3 billion price tag and has unlimited utility. When first 
proposed in 1985, the HGP was considered completely impossible. At that 
time, sequencing technology was slow, requiring several days to generate only 
a few hundred base pairs of data (see the sidebar “Open access and the Human 
Genome Project” to find out how this process was sped up). James Watson, 
one of the discoverers of DNA structure way back in the 1950s (see Chapter 6), 
was one of the first to push the project (in 1988) from idea to reality during his 
tenure as director of the National Institutes of Health. When the project got off 
the ground in 1990, a global team of scientists from 20 institutions participated. 
(The 2001 human genome sequence paper had a staggering 273 authors.)
 
The enormous benefits of the HGP remain underappreciated. Most genetic 
applications wouldn’t exist without the HGP. Here are just a few:
 
✓ Development of bioinformatics, an entirely new field focused on advanc-
ing technological capability to generate genetic data, catalog results, 
and compare genomes (flip to Chapter 23 for more).
 
✓ Development of drugs and gene therapy (see Chapter 16).
 
✓ Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders (which I cover in Chapter 12).
 
✓ Forensics applications, such as identification of criminals and determi-
nation of identity after mass disasters (flip to Chapter 18).
 
✓ Generation of thousands of jobs and economic benefits of over $25 bil-
lion in one year alone (2001).
 
✓ Identification of bacteria and viruses to allow for targeted treatment of 
disease. Some antibiotics, for example, target some strains of bacteria 
better than others. Genetic identification of bacteria is quick and inex-
pensive, allowing physicians to rapidly identify and prescribe the right 
antibiotic.
 
✓ Knowledge of which genes control what functions and how those genes 
are turned on and off (see Chapter 11).
 
✓ Understanding of the causes of cancer (which I cover in Chapter 14).

124
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Listing and explaining all the HGP’s discoveries would fill this book and then 
some. As you can see in Table 8-2, all other genome projects — mouse, fruit 
fly, yeast, roundworm, mustard weed, and so on — were started as a result of 
the HGP.
As the HGP progressed, the gene count in the human genome steadily 
declined. Originally, researchers thought that humans had as many as 
100,000 genes. But as new and more accurate information has become avail-
able over the years, they’ve determined that the human genome has only 
about 22,000 genes. Genes are often relatively small, from a base-pair stand-
point (roughly 3,000 base pairs), meaning that less than 2 percent of your 
DNA actually codes for some protein. The number of genes on different chro-
mosomes varies enormously, from nearly 3,000 genes on chromosome 1 (the 
largest) to 231 genes on the Y chromosome (the smallest).
The Human Genome Project has revealed the surprisingly dynamic and still 
changing nature of the human genome. One of the surprising discoveries of 
the HGP is that the human genome is still “growing.” Genes get duplicated 
and then gain new functions, a process that has produced as many as 1,100 
new genes. Likewise, genes lose function and “die.” Thanks to this death 
process, 37 genes in the human genome that were once functional now exist 
as pseudogenes, which have the sequence structure of normal genes but no 
longer code for proteins (see Chapter 11 for more about genes).
 
Of the human genes that researchers have identified, they only understand 
what about half of them do. Comparisons with genomes of other organisms 
help identify what genes do, because most of the proteins that human genes 
produce have counterparts in other organisms. Thus, humans share many 
genes in common with even the simplest organisms, such as bacteria and 
worms. Over 99 percent of your DNA is identical to that of any other human 
on earth, and as much as 98 percent of your DNA is identical to the sequences 
found in the mouse genome. Perhaps the greatest take-home message of the 
HGP is how alike all life on earth really is.
Sequencing: Reading the 
Language of DNA
The chemical nature of DNA (which I cover in Chapter 6) and the replication 
process (which you can discover in Chapter 7) are essential to DNA sequenc-
ing. DNA sequencing also makes use of a reaction that’s similar to the poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR) used in forensics; if you want more details 
about PCR, check out Chapter 18.

125
 Chapter 8: Sequencing Your DNA
Identifying the players in DNA sequencing
New technologies are rapidly changing the way DNA sequencing is done (see 
the sidebar “Open access and the Human Genome Project” for more info). 
The old tried-and-true approach I describe here, called the Sanger method 
(after inventor Frederick Sanger), still provides the basis for many of the new 
methods.
The key ingredients for DNA sequencing are:
 
✓ DNA: From a single individual of the organism to be sequenced.
 
✓ Primers: Several thousand copies of short sequences of DNA that are 
complementary to the part of the DNA to be sequenced.
 
✓ dNTPs: Many As, Gs, Cs, and Ts, put together with sugars and phos-
phates as nucleotides, the normal building blocks of DNA.
 
✓ ddNTPs: Many As, Gs, Cs, and Ts as nucleotides that each lack an 
oxygen atom at the 3’ spot.
 
✓ Taq polymerase: The enzyme that puts the DNA molecule together (see 
Chapter 18 for more details on Taq).
The use of ddNTPs is the key to how sequencing works. Take a careful 
look at Figure 8-1. On the left is a generic dNTP, the basic building block 
of DNA used during replication (if you don’t remember all the details, flip 
to Chapter 6 for more on dNTPs). The molecule on the right is ddNTP (di-
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate). The ddNTP is identical to the dNTP 
in every way except that it has no oxygen atom at the 3’ spot. No oxygen 
means no reaction, because the phosphate group of the next nucleotide 
can’t form a phosphodiester bond (see Chapter 6) without that extra 
oxygen atom to aid the reaction. The next nucleotide can’t hook up to 
ddNTP at the end of the chain, and the replication process stops. So how 
does stopping the reaction help the sequencing process? The idea is to 
create thousands of short pieces of DNA that give the identity of each and 
every base along the sequence.
The result of a typical sequencing reaction is a thousand fragments repre-
senting a thousand bases of the template strand. The shortest fragment is 
made up of a primer and one ddNTP representing the complement of the first 
base of the template. The next shortest fragment is made up of the primer, 
one nucleotide (from a dNTP), and a ddNTP — and so on, with the largest 
fragment being a thousand bases long.

Finding the message in sequencing results
To see the results of the sequencing reaction, scientists put the DNA frag-
ments through a process called electrophoresis. Electrophoresis is the 
movement of charged particles (in this case, DNA) under the influence of 
electricity. The purpose of electrophoresis is to sort the fragments of DNA by 
size, from smallest to largest. The smallest fragment gives the first base in the 
sequence, the second-smallest fragment gives the second base, and so on, 
until the largest fragment gives the last base in the sequence. This arrange-
ment of fragments allows researchers to read the sequence in its proper 
order.
 
A computer-driven machine called a sequencer uses a laser to see the colored 
dyes of the ddNTPs at the end of each fragment. The laser shines into the gel 
and reads the color of each fragment as it passes by. Fragments pass the laser 
in order of size, from smallest to largest. Each dye color signals a different 
letter: As show up green, Ts are red, Cs are blue, and Gs are yellow. The com-
puter automatically translates the colors into letters and stores all the infor-
mation for later analysis.
The resulting picture is a series of peaks, like you see in Figure 8-2. Each 
peak represents a different base. The sequence indicated by the peaks is the 
complement of the template strand (see Chapter 6 for more on the comple-
mentary nature of DNA). When you know the complement of the template, 
you know the template sequence itself. You can then mine this information 
for the location of genes (see Chapter 10) and compare it to the sequences of 
other organisms, such as those listed in Table 8-1.

Open access and the Human Genome Project
Prior to the Human Genome Project (HGP), 
sequencing was a very difficult and time-
consuming enterprise. Getting a 1,000-base 
long sequence required about three days of 
work and used radioactive chemicals instead 
of dyes. Sequences were read by hand and had 
to be run over and over again to fill in gaps and 
correct mistakes. Every single sequence had 
to be entered into the computer by hand — 
imagine typing thousands of As, Gs, Ts, and 
Cs! It would have taken centuries to sequence 
the human genome using the old methods. The 
sheer magnitude of the HGP required faster and 
easier techniques.
Numerous companies, government labs, and 
universities searched for solutions to make 
sequencing faster, better, and cheaper. When 
the HGP began, one automated sequencer 
machine produced 1,500 sequences (of 1,000 
base pairs each) in about 24 hours. Many 
laboratories worked together using automated 
sequencers running 24 hours a day to power 
through the entire human genome. Still, it took 
about 15 years to complete the HGP!
New technologies are leaving the once-grand 
HGP in the dust, as sequencing entire genomes 
is faster and cheaper than ever. For example, a 
microbe genome that required 3 months of work 
in 1995 was entirely sequenced in just 4 hours 
in 2006. Using high-throughput sequencing, it 
takes a staff of four people about one month 
to decode an entire human’s genome at a cost 
of $50,000 (as compared to the original HGP, 
which came in at roughly $500 million). These 
new technologies are paving the way for per-
sonalized medicine, rapid detection of disease, 
gene therapy, and much more.

D
NA is the stuff of life. Practically every organism on earth relies on 
DNA to store genetic information and transmit it from one generation 
to the next. The road from genotype (building plans) to phenotype (physi-
cal traits) begins with transcription — making a special kind of copy of DNA. 
DNA is so precious and vital to eukaryotes (organisms made up of cells with 
nuclei) that it’s kept packaged in the cell nucleus, like a rare document that’s 
copied but never removed from storage. Because it can’t leave the safety of 
the nucleus, DNA directs all the cell’s activity by delegating responsibility to 
another chemical, RNA. RNA carries messages out of the cell nucleus into the 
cytoplasm (visit Chapter 2 for more about navigating the cell) to direct the 
production of proteins during translation, a process you find out more about 
in Chapter 10.
You Already Know a Lot about RNA
If you read Chapter 6, in which I cover DNA at length, you already know a 
lot about ribonucleic acid, or RNA. From a chemical standpoint, RNA is very 
simple. It’s composed of
 
✓ Ribose sugar (instead of deoxyribose, which is found in DNA)
 
✓ Four nucleotide bases (three you know from DNA — adenine, guanine, 
and cytosine — plus an unfamiliar one called uracil)
 
✓ Phosphate (the same phosphate found in DNA)

130
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
RNA has three major characteristics that make it different from DNA:
 
✓ RNA is very unstable and decomposes rapidly.
 
✓ RNA contains uracil in place of thymine.
 
✓ RNA is almost always single-stranded.
Using a slightly different sugar
Both RNA and DNA use a ribose sugar as a main element of their chemical 
structures. The ribose sugar used in DNA is deoxyribose (find out more 
about this sugar in Chapter 6). RNA, on the other hand, uses unmodified 
ribose. Take a careful look at Figure 9-1. You can see that three spots on 
ribose are marked with numbers. (On ribose sugars, numbers are followed by 
an apostrophe [’] to indicate the designation “prime;” see Chapter 6 for more 
information.) Ribose and deoxyribose both have an oxygen (O) atom and a 
hydrogen (H) atom (an OH group) at their 3’ sites.
OH groups are also called reactive groups because oxygen atoms are very 
aggressive from a chemical standpoint (so aggressive that some chemists say 
they “attack” incoming atoms). The 3’ OH tail is required for phosphodiester 
bonds to form between nucleotides in both ribose and deoxyribose atoms, 
thanks to their aggressive oxygen atoms. (For the scoop on how phosphodi-
ester bonds form during replication, see Chapter 7.)

The difference between the two molecules is an oxygen atom at the 2’ spot: 
absent (with deoxyribose) or present (with ribose). This one oxygen atom has 
a huge hand in the differing purposes and roles of DNA and RNA:
 
✓ DNA: DNA must be protected from decomposition. The absence of one 
oxygen atom is part of the key to extending DNA’s longevity. When the 
2’ oxygen is missing, as in deoxyribose, the sugar molecule is less likely 
to get involved in chemical reactions (because oxygen is chemically 
aggressive); by being aloof, DNA avoids being broken down.

131
 Chapter 9: RNA: DNA’s Close Cousin
 
✓ RNA: RNA easily decomposes because its reactive 2’ OH tail intro-
duces RNA into chemical interactions that break up the molecule. 
Unlike DNA, RNA is a short-term tool the cell uses to send messages 
and manufacture proteins as part of gene expression (which I cover in 
Chapter 10). Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) carry out the actions of genes. 
Put simply, to turn a gene “on,” mRNAs have to be made, and to turn a 
gene “off,” the mRNAs that turned it “on” have to be removed. So the 2’ 
OH tail is a built-in mechanism that allows RNA to be decomposed, or 
removed, rapidly and easily when the message is no longer needed and 
the gene needs to be turned “off” (see Chapter 11 for more on turning 
genes off and on).
Meeting a new base: Uracil
RNA is composed of four nucleotide bases. Three of the four bases may be 
quite familiar to you because they’re also part of DNA: adenine (A), guanine 
(G), and cytosine (C). The fourth base, uracil (U), is found only in RNA. (In 
DNA, the fourth base is thymine. See Chapter 6 for details.) RNA’s bases are 
pictured in Figure 9-2.

Uracil may be new to you, but it’s actually the precursor of DNA’s thymine. 
When your body produces nucleotides, uracil is hooked up with a ribose and 
three phosphates to form a ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP). (Check out 
Figure 9-5 later in the chapter to see an rNTP.) If DNA is being replicated, or 
copied (see Chapter 7 for the details on DNA’s copying process), deoxyribo-
nucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) of thymine — not uracil — are needed, 
meaning that a few things have to happen:
 
✓ The 2’ oxygen must be removed from ribose to make deoxyribose.
 
✓ A chemical group must be added to uracil’s ring structure (all the bases 
are rings; see Chapter 6 for details on how these rings stack up). Folic 
acid, otherwise known as vitamin B9, helps add a carbon and three 
hydrogen atoms (CH3, referred to as a methyl group) to uracil to convert 
it to thymine.

132
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Uracil carries genetic information in the same way thymine does, as part of 
sequences of bases. (In fact, the genetic code that’s translated into protein is 
written using uracil; see Chapter 10 for more on the genetic code.)
 
The complementary base pairing rules that apply to DNA (see Chapter 6) also 
apply to RNA: purines with pyrimidines (that is, G with C and A with U). So 
why are there two versions of essentially the same base (uracil and thymine)?
 
✓ Thymine protects the DNA molecule better than uracil can because 
that little methyl group (CH3) helps make DNA less obvious to chemi-
cals called nucleases that chew up both DNA and RNA. Nucleases are 
enzymes (chemicals that cause reactions to occur) that act on nucleic 
acids (see Chapter 6 for why DNA and RNA are called nucleic acids). 
Your body uses nucleases to attack unwanted RNA and DNA molecules 
(such as viruses and bacteria), but if methyl groups are present, nucle-
ases can’t bond as easily with the nucleic acid to break its chains. (The 
methyl group also makes DNA hydrophobic; see Chapter 6 for why DNA 
is afraid of water.)
 
✓ Uracil is a very friendly base; it easily bonds with the other three bases 
to form pairs. Uracil’s amorous nature is great for RNA, which needs to 
form all sorts of interesting turns, twists, and knots to do its job (see the 
next section, “Stranded!”). DNA’s message is too important to trust to 
such an easygoing base as uracil; strict base pairing rules must be fol-
lowed to protect DNA’s message from mutation (see Chapter 13 for more 
on how base pair rules protect DNA’s message from getting garbled). 
Thymine, as uracil’s less friendly near-twin, only bonds with adenine, 
making it perfectly suited to protect DNA’s message.
Stranded!
RNA is almost always single-stranded, and DNA is always double-stranded. 
The double-stranded nature of DNA helps protect its message and provides a 
simple way for the molecule to be copied during replication. Like DNA, RNA 
loves to hook up with complementary bases. But RNA is a bit narcissistic; 
it likes to form bonds with itself (see Figure 9-3), creating what’s called a 
secondary structure. The primary structure of RNA is the single-stranded mol-
ecule; when the molecule bonds with itself and gets all twisted and folded up, 
the result is the secondary structure.
Three major types of RNA carry out the business of expressing DNA’s mes-
sage (Chapter 23 covers other RNAs). Although all three RNAs function as a 
team during translation (which I cover in Chapter 10), the individual types 
carry out very specific functions.

Transcription: Copying DNA’s Message 
into RNA’s Language
A transcript is a record of something, not an exact copy. In genetics, transcrip-
tion is the process of recording part of the DNA message in a related, but 
different, language — the language of RNA. (To review differences between 
DNA and RNA, jump back to “You Already Know a Lot about RNA,” earlier 
in this chapter.) Transcription is necessary because DNA is too valuable to 
be moved or tampered with. The DNA molecule is the plan, and any error 
that’s introduced into the plan (as a mutation, which I address in Chapter 13) 
causes lots of problems. If part or all of the DNA molecule were lost, the cell 
would die (flip to Chapter 14 for more on cell death). Transcription keeps 
DNA safe by letting a temporary RNA copy take the risk of leaving the cell 
nucleus and going out into the cytoplasm.
 
Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are the specific type of RNA responsible for carrying 
DNA’s message from the cell nucleus into the cytoplasm (check out Chapter 2 
for a review of cell parts).

134
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
With transcription, the DNA inside the nucleus goes through a process similar 
to replication (see Chapter 7) to get the message out as RNA. When DNA is 
replicated, the result is another DNA molecule that’s exactly like the original 
in every way. But in transcription, many mRNAs are created because, instead 
of transcribing the entire DNA molecule, only messages of genes are tran-
scribed into mRNA. Transcription has several steps:
 
1. Enzymes identify the right part of the DNA molecule to transcribe (see 
the upcoming section “Getting ready to transcribe”).
 
2. The DNA molecule is opened up to make the message accessible (see 
“Initiation”).
 
3. Enzymes build the mRNA strand (see “Elongation”).
 
4. The DNA molecule snaps shut to release the newly synthesized mRNA 
(see “Termination”).
Getting ready to transcribe
In preparing to transcribe DNA into mRNA, three things need to be 
completed:
 
✓ Locate the proper gene sequence within the billions of bases that make 
up DNA.
 
✓ Determine which of the two strands of DNA to transcribe.
 
✓ Gather up the nucleotides of RNA and the enzymes needed to carry out 
transcription.
Locating the gene
Your chromosomes are made up of roughly 3 billion base pairs of DNA and 
contain roughly 22,000 genes (see Chapter 8). But only about 1 percent of 
your DNA gets transcribed into mRNA. Genes, the sequences that do get tran-
scribed, vary in size. The average gene is only about 3,000 base pairs long, 
but the human genome also has some gigantic genes — for example, the gene 
that’s implicated in a particular form of muscular dystrophy (Duchenne) is a 
whopping 2.5 million base pairs.
 
Before a gene of any size can be transcribed, it must be located. The cue that 
says “start transcription here” is written right into the DNA in regions called 
promoters. (The promoter also controls how often the process takes place; see 
the “Initiation” section later in the chapter.) The sequence that indicates 
where to stop transcribing is called a terminator. The gene, the promoter, and 
the terminator together are called the transcription unit (see Figure 9-4).

The promoter sequences tell the enzymes of transcription where to start work 
and are located within 30 or so base pairs of the genes they control. Each gene 
has its own promoter. In eukaryotes, the beginning sequence of the promoter 
is always the same, and it’s called the TATA box because the sequence of 
the bases is TATAAA. The presence of TATA tells the transcription-starting 
enzyme that the gene to transcribe is about 30 base pairs away. Sequences 
like TATA that are the same in many (if not all) organisms are called consensus 
sequences, indicating that the sequences agree or mean the same thing every-
where they appear.
Locating the right strand
By now you’ve (hopefully) picked up on the fact that DNA is double-stranded. 
Those double strands aren’t identical, though; they’re complementary, mean-
ing that the sequence of bases matches up, but it doesn’t spell the same 
words of the genetic code (see Chapter 10 for genetic code info). The genetic 
code of DNA works like this: Bases of genes are read in three base sets, like 
words. For example, three adenines in a row (AAA) are transcribed into 
mRNA as three uracils (UUU). During translation, UUU tells the ribosome to 
use an amino acid called phenylalanine as part of the protein it’s making. 
If the complementary DNA, TTT, were transcribed, you’d wind up with an 
mRNA saying AAA, which specifies lysine. A protein containing lysine will 
function differently than one containing phenylalanine.
 
Because complements don’t spell the same genetic words, you can get two dif-
ferent messages depending on which strand of DNA is transcribed into mRNA. 
Therefore, genes can only be read from one of the two strands of the double-
stranded DNA molecule — but which one? The TATA box (the promoter; see 
the preceding “Locating the gene” section) not only indicates where a gene is 
but also tells which strand holds the gene’s information. TATA boxes indicate 
that a gene is about 30 bases away going in the 3’ direction (sometimes 
referred to as downstream). Genes along the DNA molecule run in both direc-
tions, but any given gene is transcribed only in the 3’ direction. Because only 
one strand is transcribed, the two strands are designated in one of two ways:

136
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
✓ Template: This strand provides the pattern for transcription.
 
✓ Nontemplate: This strand is the original message that’s actually being 
transcribed.
TATA is on the nontemplate strand and indicates that the other (comple-
mentary) strand is to be used as the template for transcription. Look back at 
Figure 9-4 and compare the template to the RNA transcript — they’re comple-
mentary. Now compare the mRNA transcript to the nontemplate strand. The 
only difference between the two is that uracil appears in place of thymine. 
The RNA is the transcript of the nontemplate strand.
Gathering building blocks and enzymes
In addition to template DNA (see the preceding section), the following ingre-
dients are needed for successful transcription:
 
✓ Ribonucleotides, the building blocks of RNA
 
✓ Enzymes and other proteins, to assemble the growing RNA strand in the 
process of RNA synthesis
The building blocks of RNA are nearly identical to those used in DNA syn-
thesis, which I explain in Chapter 7. The differences, of course, are that for 
RNA, ribose is used in place of deoxyribose, and uracil replaces thymine. 
Otherwise, the rNTPs (ribonucleoside triphosphates; see Figure 9-5) look 
very much like the dNTPs you’re hopefully already familiar with.
In a process similar to replication, transcription requires the services of vari-
ous enzymes to:
 
✓ Find the promoter (see the earlier “Locating the gene” section)
 
✓ Open up the DNA molecule (see the later “Initiation” section)
 
✓ Assemble the growing strand of RNA (see the later “Elongation” section)
Unlike replication, though, transcription has fewer enzymes to keep track of. 
The main player is RNA polymerase. Like DNA polymerase (which you can 
meet in Chapter 7), RNA polymerase recognizes each base on the template 
and adds the appropriate complementary base to the growing RNA strand, 
substituting uracil where DNA polymerase would supply thymine. RNA poly-
merase hooks up with a large group of enzymes — called a holoenzyme — to 
carry out this process. The individual enzymes making up the holoenzyme 
vary between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, but their functions remain the 
same: to recognize and latch onto the promoter and to call RNA polymerase 
over to join the party.
 
Eukaryotes have three kinds of RNA polymerase, which vary only in which 
genes they transcribe.

137
 Chapter 9: RNA: DNA’s Close Cousin
 
✓ RNA polymerase I takes care of long rRNA molecules.
 
✓ RNA polymerase II carries out the synthesis of most mRNA and some 
tiny, specialized types of RNA molecules that are used in RNA editing 
after transcription is over (see “Post-transcription Processing” later in 
this chapter).
 
✓ RNA polymerase III transcribes tRNA genes and other small RNAs used 
in RNA editing.

Initiation
Initiation includes finding the gene and opening up the DNA molecule so that 
the enzymes can get to work. The process of initiation is pretty simple:
 
1. The holoenzyme (group of enzymes that hook up with RNA poly-
merase) finds the promoter.
 
 The promoter of each gene controls how often transcription makes an 
mRNA transcript to carry out the gene’s action. RNA polymerase can’t 
bind to a gene that isn’t scheduled for transcription. In eukaryotes, 
enhancers, which are sequences sometimes distantly located from the 
transcription unit, also control how often a particular gene is transcribed. 
To find out more about how genes are turned on, flip to Chapter 11.

138
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
2. RNA polymerase opens up the double-stranded DNA molecule to 
expose a very short section of the template strand.
 
 When the promoter “boots up” to initiate transcription, the holoenzyme 
complex binds to the promoter site and signals RNA polymerase. RNA 
polymerase binds to the template at the start site for transcription. RNA 
polymerase can’t “see” past the sugar-phosphate backbone of DNA, so 
transcription can’t occur if the molecule isn’t first opened up to expose 
single strands. RNA polymerase melts the hydrogen bonds between the 
double-stranded DNA molecule and opens up a short stretch of the helix 
to expose the template. The opening created by RNA polymerase when 
it wedges its way between the two strands of the helix is called the tran-
scription bubble (see Figure 9-6).
 
3. RNA polymerase strings together rNTPs to form mRNA (or one of the 
other types of RNA, such as tRNA or rRNA).
 
 RNA polymerase doesn’t need a primer to begin synthesis of a new 
mRNA molecule (unlike DNA replication; see Chapter 7 for details). 
RNA polymerase simply reads the first base of the transcription unit 
and lays down the appropriate complementary rNTP. This first rNTP 
doesn’t lose its three phosphate molecules because no phosphodies-
ter bond is formed at the 5’ side. Those two extra phosphates remain 
until the mRNA is edited later in the transcription process (see “Post-
transcription Processing” later in this chapter).

 Chapter 9: RNA: DNA’s Close Cousin
Elongation
After RNA polymerase puts down the first rNTP, it continues opening the 
DNA helix and synthesizing mRNA by adding rNTPs until the entire transcrip-
tional unit is transcribed. The transcription bubble (the opening between 
DNA strands) itself is very small; only about 20 bases of DNA are exposed at a 
time. So as RNA polymerase moves down the transcription unit, only the part 
of the template that’s actively being transcribed is exposed. The helix snaps 
shut as RNA polymerase steams ahead to push the newly synthesized mRNA 
molecule off the template (refer to Figure 9-6). An enzyme like gyrase (see 
Chapter 7) probably works to keep the DNA molecule from getting knotted up 
during the opening, transcribing, and closing process (but scientists aren’t 
certain at this point).
The transcriptional units of genes contain sequences that aren’t translated into 
protein. However, these sequences may control how genes are expressed (see 
Chapter 11 to find out more). As you may expect, geneticists have come up 
with terms for the parts that are translated and those that aren’t:
 
✓ Introns: Noncoding sequences that get their name from their intervening 
presence. Genes often have many introns that fall between the parts of 
the gene that code for phenotype.
 
✓ Exons: Coding sequences that get their name from their expressed nature.
The entire gene — introns and exons — is transcribed (refer to Figure 9-6). 
After transcription has terminated, part of the editing process is the removal 
of introns. I cover the process of snipping out introns and splicing together 
exons in the section “Editing the message,” later in this chapter.
 
Prokaryotes don’t have introns because prokaryotic genes are all coding, or 
exon. Only eukaryotes have genes interrupted by intron sequences. Almost all 
eukaryotic genes have at least one intron; the maximum number of introns in 
any one gene is 200. Scientists continue to explore the function of introns, 
which in part control how different mRNAs are edited.
Termination
When RNA polymerase encounters the terminator (as a sequence in the DNA, 
not the scary, gun-toting movie character), it transcribes the terminator 
sequence and then stops transcription. What happens next varies depending 
on the organism.

140
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
✓ In prokaryotic cells, some terminator sequences have a series of bases 
that are complementary and cause the mRNA to fold back on itself. The 
folding stops RNA polymerase from moving forward and pulls the mRNA 
off the template.
 
✓ In eukaryotic cells, a special protein called a termination factor aids RNA 
in finding the right stopping place.
In any event, after RNA polymerase stops adding rNTPs, the mRNA gets 
detached from the template. The holoenzyme and RNA polymerase let go 
of the template, and the double-stranded DNA molecule snaps back into its 
natural helix shape.
Post-transcription Processing
Before mRNA can venture out of the cell nucleus and into the cytoplasm for 
translation, it needs a few modifications. And I just happen to cover them in 
the following sections.
Adding cap and tail
The “naked” mRNA that’s produced by transcription needs to get dressed 
before translation:
 
✓ A 5’ cap is added.
 
✓ A long tail of adenine bases is tacked on.
RNA polymerase starts the process of transcription by using an unmodified 
rNTP (see the section “Initiation” earlier in this chapter). But a 5’ cap needs 
to be added to the mRNA to allow the ribosome to recognize it during trans-
lation (see Chapter 10 for more on translation). The first part of adding the 
cap is the removal of one of the three phosphates from the leading end of the 
mRNA strand. A guanine, in the form of a ribonucleotide, is then attached to 
the lead base of the mRNA. (Figure 9-7 illustrates the process of cap and tail 
attachment to the mRNA.) Several groups composed of a carbon atom with 
three hydrogen atoms (CH3, called a methyl group) attach at various sites — 
on the guanine and on the first and second nucleotides of the mRNA. Like the 
methyl groups that protect the thymine-bearing DNA molecule, the methyl 
groups at the 5’ end of the mRNA protect it from decomposition and allow 
the ribosome to recognize the mRNA as ready for translation.

141
 Chapter 9: RNA: DNA’s Close Cousin
In eukaryotes, a long string of adenines is added to the 3’ end of the mRNA to 
further protect the mRNA from natural nuclease activity long enough to get 
translated (see Figure 9-7). This string is called the poly-A tail. RNA molecules 
are easily degraded and destroyed because of their temporary natures. Like 
memos, RNA molecules are linked to a specific task, and when the task is 
over, the memo is discarded. But the message has to last long enough to be 
read, sometimes more than once, before it hits the shredder (in this case, 
nucleases do the shredding instead of guilty business executives). The length 
of the poly-A tail determines how long the message lasts and how many 
times it can be translated by the ribosomes before nucleases eat the tail and 
destroy the message.

Editing the message
The final step in preparing mRNA for translation is twofold: removing the 
noncoding intron sequences and stringing the exons together without inter-
ruptions between them. Several specialized types of RNA work to find the 
start and end points of introns, pull the exons together, and snip out the 
extra RNA (that is, the intron).
While it’s still in the nucleus, a complex of proteins and small RNA molecules 
called a spliceosome inspects the newly manufactured mRNA. The spliceo-
some is like a roaming workshop that recognizes introns and works to 
remove them from between exons. The spliceosome recognizes consensus 

142
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
sequences that mark the beginnings and endings of introns (look back at the 
“Locating the gene” section to review consensus sequences). The spliceo-
some grabs each end of the intron and pulls the ends toward each other to 
form a loop. This movement has the effect of bringing the beginning of one 
exon close to the end of the preceding one. The spliceosome then snips out 
the intron and hooks the exons together in a process called splicing. Splicing 
creates a phosphodiester bond between the two exon sequences, which seals 
them together as one strand of mRNA.
Introns can be spliced out leaving all the exons in their original order, or 
introns and exons can be spliced out to create a new sequence of exons 
(refer to Figure 9-6 for a couple of examples). The splicing of introns and 
exons is called alternative splicing and results in the possibility for one gene 
to be expressed in different ways. Thanks to alternative splicing, the 22,000 
or so genes in humans are able to produce around 90,000 different proteins. 
New evidence suggests that practically all multi-exon genes (which make up 
roughly 86 percent of the human genome) can be sliced and diced in multiple 
ways, thanks to alternative splicing.
 
One of the secrets to the genetic flexibility of alternative splicing is sequences 
called Alu elements. Alu elements are fairly short sequences that show up all 
over the human genome (see Chapter 8 for how scientists are exploring the 
human genome) — your DNA may have as many as 1 million copies of Alu. Alu 
can be spliced into or out of genes (sometimes more than once) to create 
alternative forms of mRNA from the same original gene sequence. This 
sequence turns out to act as an exon and is considered a reason to scrap the 
term “junk DNA” altogether. The enormous versatility of RNA editing has lead 
some scientists to think of RNA as “the” genetic material instead of DNA (see 
Chapter 23).
After the introns are spliced and all the exons are strung together, the 
mRNA molecule is complete and ready for action. It migrates out of the cell 
nucleus, encounters an army of ribosomes, and goes through the process of 
translation — the final step in converting the genetic message from DNA to 
protein.

F
rom building instructions to implementation, the message that DNA 
carries follows a predictable path. First, DNA provides the template for 
transcription of the message into RNA. Then, RNA (in the form of messenger 
RNA) moves out of the cell nucleus and into the cytoplasm to provide the 
building plans for proteins. Every living thing is made of proteins, which are 
long chains of amino acids called polypeptides that are folded into complex 
shapes and hooked together in intricate ways.
All the physical characteristics (that is, the phenotypes) of your body are 
made up of thousands of different proteins. Of course, your body is also 
composed of other things, too, like water, minerals, and fats. But proteins 
supply the framework to organize all those other building blocks, and pro-
teins carry out all your necessary bodily functions, like digestion, respira-
tion, and elimination.
In this chapter, I explain how RNA provides the blueprint for manufacturing 
proteins, the final step in the transformation from genotype (genetic informa-
tion) to phenotype. Before you dive into the translation process, you need 
to know a few things about the genetic code — the information that mRNA 
carries — and how the code is read. If you skipped over Chapter 8, you may 
want to go back and review its material on RNA before moving on.
Discovering the Good in a Degenerate
When Watson and Crick (along with Rosalind Franklin; see Chapter 6 for the 
full scoop) discovered that DNA is made up of two strands composed of four 
bases, the big question they faced was: How can only four bases contain 
enough information to encode complex phenotypes?

144
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
Complex phenotypes (such as your bone structure, eye color, and ability to 
digest spicy food) are the result of combinations of proteins. The genetic code 
(that is, DNA transcribed as RNA; see Chapter 9) provides the instructions to 
make these proteins (via translation; see “Meeting the Translating Team” later 
in this chapter). Proteins are made up of amino acids strung together in vari-
ous combinations to create chains called polypeptides (which is a fancy way 
of saying “protein”). Polypeptide chains can vary from 50 to 1,000 amino acids 
in length. Because there are 20 different amino acids, and because chains are 
often more than 100 amino acids in length, the variety of combinations is enor-
mous. For example, a polypeptide that’s only 5 amino acids long has 3,200,000 
combinations!
After experiments showed that DNA was truly the genetic material (see 
Chapter 6), skeptics continued to point to the simplicity of the four bases 
in RNA and argued that a code of four bases wouldn’t work to encode 
complex peptides. Reading the genetic code one base at a time — U, C, A, 
and G — would mean that there simply weren’t enough bases to make 20 
amino acids. So it was obvious to scientists that the code must be made 
up of multiple bases read together. A two-base code didn’t work because it 
only produced 16 combinations — too few to account for 20 amino acids. A 
three-base code (referred to as a triplet code) looked like overkill, because 
a codon, which is a combination of three nucleotides in a row, that chooses 
from four bases at each position produces 64 possible combinations. 
Skeptics argued that a triplet code contains too much redundancy — after 
all, there are only 20 amino acids.
As it turns out, the genetic code is degenerate, which is a fancy way of saying 
“too much information.” Normally, degenerate means something to the effect 
of “bad and getting worse” (it’s usually used to describe some people — I 
won’t name names). In the genetic sense, the degeneracy of the triplet code 
means that the code is highly flexible and tolerates some mistakes — which 
is a good thing.
 
Several features of the genetic code are important to keep in mind. The code is
 
✓ Triplet, meaning that bases are read three at a time in codons.
 
✓ Degenerate, meaning that 18 of the 20 amino acids are specified by two 
or more codons (see the next section, “Considering the combinations”).
 
✓ Orderly, meaning that each codon is read in only one way and in only 
one direction, just as English is read left to right (see “Framed! Reading 
the code” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Nearly universal, meaning that just about every organism on earth 
interprets the language of the code in exactly the same way (see “Not 
quite universal” for exceptions).

145
 Chapter 10: Translating the Genetic Code
Considering the combinations
Only 61 of the 64 codons are used to specify the 20 amino acids found in pro-
teins. The three codons that don’t code for any amino acid simply spell “stop,” 
telling the ribosome to cease the translation process (see “Termination” later 
in this chapter). In contrast, the one codon that tells the ribosome that an 
mRNA is ripe for translating — the “start” codon — codes for an amino acid, 
methionine. (The “start” amino acid comes in a special form; see “Initiation” 
later in this chapter.) In Figure 10-1, you can see the entire code with all the 
alternative spellings for the 20 amino acids. (See “Meeting the Translating 
Team” later in this chapter for more details about amino acids.)

For many of the amino acids, the alternative spellings differ only by one 
base — the third base of the codon. For example, four of the six spellings 
for leucine start with the bases CU. This flexibility at the third position 
of the codon is called a wobble. The third base of the mRNA can vary, or 

146
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
wobble, without changing the meaning of the codon (and thus the amino 
acid it codes for). The wobble is possible because of the way tRNAs (transfer 
RNAs) and mRNAs pair up during the process of translation. The first two 
bases of the code on the mRNA and the partner tRNA (which is carrying 
the amino acid specified by the codon) must be exact matches. However, 
the third base of the tRNA can break the base-pairing rules, allowing bonds 
with mRNA bases other than the usual complements. This rule violation, 
or wobble, allows different spellings to code for the same amino acid. 
However, some codons, like one of the three stop codons (spelled UGA), 
have only one meaning; wobbles in this stop codon change the meaning 
from stop to either cysteine (spelled UGU or UGC) or tryptophan (UGG).
Framed! Reading the code
Besides its combination possibilities, another important feature of the 
genetic code is the way in which the codons are read. Each codon is sepa-
rate, with no overlapping. And the code doesn’t have any punctuation — it’s 
read straight through without pauses.
The codons of the genetic code run sequentially, as you can see in Figure 10-2. 
Each codon is read only once using a reading frame, a series of sequential, non-
overlapping codons. The start codon defines the position of the reading frame. 
In the mRNA in Figure 10-2, the sequence AUG, which spells methionine, is a 
start codon. After the start codon, the bases are read three at a time without 
a break until the stop codon is reached. (Mutations often disrupt the reading 
frame by inserting or removing one base; see Chapter 13 for more details.)

Not quite universal
The meaning of the genetic code is nearly universal. That means nearly every 
organism on earth uses the same spellings in the triplet code. Mitochondrial 
DNA spells a few words differently from nuclear DNA, which may explain 
(or at least relate back to) mitochondria’s unusual origins (see Chapter 6). 
Plants, bacteria, and a few microorganisms also use unusual spellings for one 
or more amino acids. Otherwise, the way the code is read — influenced by its 

147

degenerate nature, with wobbles, without punctuation, and using a specific 
reading frame — is the same. As scientists tackle DNA sequencing for various 
creatures (see Chapter 8), more unusual spellings are likely to pop up.
Meeting the Translating Team
Translation is the process of converting information from one language into 
another. In this case, the genetic language of nucleic acid is translated into 
the language of protein. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm of cells. 
After messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are created through transcription and move 
into the cytoplasm, the protein production process begins (see Chapter 9 for 
the lowdown on mRNA). The players involved in protein production include
 
✓ Ribosome: The big protein-making factory that reads mRNA’s message 
and carries out the message’s instructions. Ribosomes are made up of 
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and are capable of constructing any sort of protein.
 
✓ The genetic code: The message carried by mRNA (see “Discovering the 
Good in a Degenerate” earlier in this chapter for more on the genetic 
code).
 
✓ Amino acids: Complex chemical compounds containing nitrogen and 
carbon; 20 amino acids strung together in thousands of unique combina-
tions are used to construct proteins.
 
✓ Transfer RNA (tRNA): Runs a courier service to provide amino-acid 
building blocks to the working ribosome; each tRNA summoned by the 
ribosome grabs the amino acid that the codon specifies.
Taking the Translation Trip
Translation proceeds in a series of predictable steps:
 
1. A ribosome recognizes an mRNA and latches onto its 5’ cap (see Chapter 
8 for an explanation of how and why mRNAs get caps). The ribosome 
slurps up the mRNA and carefully scrutinizes it, looking for codons that 
form the words of the genetic code, beginning with the start codon.
 
2. tRNAs supply the amino acids dictated by each codon when the ribo-
some reads the instructions. The ribosome assembles the polypeptide 
chain with the help of various enzymes and other proteins.
 
3. The ribosome continues to assemble the polypeptide chain until it 
reaches the stop codon. The completed polypeptide chain is released.
After it’s released from the ribosome, the polypeptide chain is modified and 
folded to become a mature protein.

148
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Initiation
Preparation for translation consists of two major events:
 
✓ The tRNA molecules must be hooked up with the right amino acids in a 
process called charging.
 
✓ The ribosome, which comes in two pieces, must assemble itself at the 
start codon of the mRNA.
Charge! tRNA hooks up with a nice amino acid
Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules are small, specialized RNAs produced by tran-
scription. However, unlike mRNAs, tRNAs are never translated into protein; 
tRNA’s whole function is ferrying amino acids to the ribosomes for assembly 
into polypeptides. tRNAs are uniquely shaped to carry out their job. In Figure 
10-3, you see two depictions of tRNA. The illustration on the left shows you 
tRNA’s true form. The illustration on the right is a simplified version that 
makes tRNA’s parts easier to identify. The cloverleaf shape is one of the keys to 
the way tRNA works. tRNA gets its unusual configuration because many of the 
bases in its sequence are complements; the strand folds, and the complemen-
tary bases form bonds, resulting in the loops and arms of a typical tRNA.

Bases 
The two key elements of tRNA are
 
✓ Anticodon: A three-base sequence on one loop of each tRNA; the antico-
don is complementary to one of the codons spelled by mRNA.
 
✓ Acceptor arm: The single-stranded tail of the tRNA; where the amino 
acid corresponding to the codon is attached to the tRNA.

149
 Chapter 10: Translating the Genetic Code
 
The codon of mRNA specifies the amino acid used during translation. The anti-
codon of the tRNA is complementary to the codon of mRNA and specifies 
which amino acid each tRNA is built to carry.
Like a battery, tRNAs must be charged in order to work. tRNAs get charged 
with the help of a special group of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthe-
tases. Twenty synthetases exist, one for each amino acid specified by the 
codons of mRNA. Take a look at the illustration on the right in Figure 10-3, the 
schematic of tRNA. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases recognize sequences of 
bases in the anticodon of the tRNA that announce which amino acid that par-
ticular tRNA is built to carry. When the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase encoun-
ters the tRNA molecule that matches its amino acid, the synthetase binds 
the amino acid to the tRNA at the acceptor arm — this is the charging part. 
Figure 10-4 shows the connection of amino acid and tRNA. The synthetases 
proofread to make sure that each amino acid is on the appropriate tRNA. 
This proofreading ensures that errors in tRNA charging are very rare and 
prevents errors in translation later on. With the amino acid attached to it, the 
tRNA is charged and ready to make the trip to the ribosome.

Putting the ribosome together
Ribosomes come in two parts called subunits (see Figure 10-5), and ribosomal 
subunits come in two sizes: large and small. The two subunits float around 
(sometimes together and sometimes as separate pieces) in the cytoplasm until 
translation begins. Unlike tRNAs, which match specific codons, ribosomes are 
completely flexible and can work with any mRNA they encounter. Because of 
their versatility, ribosomes are sometimes called “the workbench of the cell.”
When fully assembled, each ribosome has two sites and one slot:

150
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
✓ A-site (acceptor site): Where tRNA molecules insert their anticodon 
arms to match up with the codon of the mRNA molecule.
 
✓ P-site (peptidyl site): Where amino acids get hooked together using 
peptide bonds.
 
✓ Exit slot: Where tRNAs are released from the ribosome after their amino 
acids become part of the growing polypeptide chain.
Before translation can begin, the smaller of the two ribosome subunits 
attaches to the 5’ cap of the mRNA with the help of proteins called initiation 
factors. The small subunit then scoots along the mRNA until it hits the start 
codon (AUG). The P-site on the small ribosome subunit lines up with the 
start codon, and the small subunit is joined by the tRNA carrying methionine 
(UAC), the amino acid that matches the start codon. The “start” tRNA totes a 
special version of methionine called fMet (short for N-formylmethionine). Only 
the tRNA for fMet can attach to the ribosome at the P-site without first going 
through the A-site. The tRNA uses its anticodon, which is complementary to 
the codon of the mRNA, to hook up to the mRNA. The large ribosome subunit 
joins with the small subunit to begin the process of hooking together all the 
amino acids specified by the mRNA (refer to Figure 10-5).

 Chapter 10: Translating the Genetic Code
Elongation
When the initiation process is complete, translation proceeds in several 
steps called elongation, which you can follow in Figure 10-5.
 
1. The ribosome calls for the tRNA carrying the amino acid specified by the 
codon residing in the A-site. The appropriate charged tRNA inserts its 
anticodon arm into the A-site.
 
2. Enzymes bond the two amino acids attached to the acceptor arms of the 
tRNAs in the P- and A-sites.
 
3. As soon as the two amino acids are linked together, the ribosome scoots 
over to the next codon of the mRNA. The tRNA that was formerly in the 
P-site now enters the exit site, and because it’s no longer charged with 
an amino acid, the empty tRNA is released from the ribosome. The A-site 
is left empty, and the P-site is occupied by a tRNA holding its own amino 
acid and the amino acid of the preceding tRNA. The process of moving 
from one codon to the next is called translocation (not to be confused 
with the chromosomal translocations I describe in Chapter 15, where 
pieces of whole chromosomes are inappropriately swapped).
 
The ribosome continues to scoot along the mRNA in a 5’ to 3’ direction. The 
growing polypeptide chain is always attached to the tRNA that’s sitting in the 
P-site, and the A-site is opened up repeatedly to accept the next charged tRNA. 
The process comes to a stop when the ribosome encounters one of the three 
stop codons. (For more on stop codons, see “Considering the combinations” 
earlier in this chapter.)
Termination
No tRNAs match the stop codon, so when the ribosome reads “stop,” no 
more tRNAs enter the A-site (see Figure 10-6). At this point, a tRNA sits in 
the P-site with the newly constructed polypeptide chain attached to it by the 
tRNA’s own amino acid. Special proteins called release factors move in and 
bind to the ribosome; one of the release factors recognizes the stop codon 
and sparks the reaction that cleaves the polypeptide chain from the last 
tRNA. After the polypeptide is released, the ribosome comes apart, releas-
ing the final tRNA from the P-site. The ribosomal subunits are then free to 
find another mRNA to begin the translation process anew. Transfer RNAs are 
recharged with fresh amino acids and can be used over and over. Once freed, 
polypeptide chains assume their unique shapes and sometimes hook up with 
other polypeptides to carry out their jobs as fully functioning proteins (see 
the “Proteins Are Precious Polypeptides” section later in the chapter).

152
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Messenger RNAs may be translated more than once and, in fact, may be 
translated by more than one ribosome at a time. As soon as the start codon 
emerges from the ribosome after the initiation of translation, another ribo-
some may recognize the mRNA’s 5’ cap, latch on, and start translating. Thus, 
many polypeptide chains can be manufactured very rapidly.

 Chapter 10: Translating the Genetic Code
Proteins Are Precious Polypeptides
 
Besides water, the most common substance in your cells is protein. Proteins 
carry out the business of life. The key to a protein’s function is its shape; com-
pleted proteins can be made of one or more polypeptide chains that are 
folded and hooked together. The way proteins fit and fold together depends 
on which amino acids are present in the polypeptide chains.
Recognizing radical groups
Every amino acid in a polypeptide chain shares several features, which you 
can see in Figure 10-7:
Challenging the dogma
In other disciplines (say, physics), laws abound 
to describe the goings-on of the world. The law 
of gravity, for example, tolerates no violators. 
But genetics doesn’t have laws because sci-
entists keep acquiring new information. One 
exception is the Central Dogma of Genetics. 
A dogma isn’t law; rather, it’s more or less 
universally accepted opinion about how the 
world works. In this case, the Central Dogma of 
Genetics (coined by our old friend Francis Crick, 
of DNA-discovery fame; see Chapter 6) posited 
that the trip from genotype to phenotype is a 
one-way information highway.
Genetics seems to be a subject full of excep-
tions, and the Central Dogma is no . . . exception. 
Reverse transcription (that is, transmitting 
RNA’s message back into DNA) does occur 
in some cases like viruses such as HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. RNA may also undergo 
replication (much as DNA does; see Chapter 
7) transmitting information from RNA to RNA. 
Some evidence has even shown that DNA 
can be translated directly into protein without 
RNA at all (at least under laboratory condi-
tions). In addition, there have been many new 
discoveries about the powerful roles that RNA 
has outside of translation. It turns out that many 
non-coding RNAs exist — that is, RNAs that 
don’t code for proteins but play important roles 
in how genes are expressed (gene expression 
is the topic of Chapter 11).
Another idea that nearly attained the status of 
law was the one gene–one polypeptide hypoth-
esis. Polypeptides, more familiarly known as 
proteins, are the products of gene messages. 
Back in the early 1940s, long before DNA was 
known to be the genetic material, two scien-
tists, George Beadle and Edward Tatum, deter-
mined that genes code for proteins. Through a 
complex set of experiments, Beadle and Tatum 
discovered that each protein chain manufac-
tured during translation is the product of only 
one gene’s message. We now know that many 
different mRNA combinations are possible 
from a single gene. Each mRNA acts alone to 
make one polypeptide. Even here, there can be 
exceptions — some organisms may use a single 
codon to signal two different amino acids.

ical groups, that differentiate the 20 amino acids specified by the genetic

 Chapter 10: Translating the Genetic Code
Amino acid radical groups come in four flavors: water-loving (hydrophilic), 
water-hating (hydrophobic), negatively charged (bases), and positively 
charged (acids). When their amino acids are part of a polypeptide chain, radi-
cal groups of adjacent amino acids alternate sides along the chain (refer to 
Figure 10-7). Because of their differing affinities (those four flavors), the radi-
cal groups either repel or attract neighboring groups. This reaction leads to 
folding and gives each protein its shape.
Giving the protein its shape
Proteins are folded into complex and often beautiful shapes, as you can 
see in Figure 10-8. These arrangements are partly the result of spontaneous 
attractions between radical groups (see the preceding section for details) 
and partly the result of certain regions of polypeptide chains that naturally 
form spirals (also called helices, not to be confused with DNA’s double 
helix in Chapter 6). The spirals may weave back and forth to form sheets. 
These spirals and sheets are referred to as a secondary structure (the simple, 
unfolded polypeptide chain is the primary structure).
Proteins are often modified after translation and may get hooked up with 
various other chemical groups and metals (such as iron). In a process similar 
to the post-transcription modification of mRNA, proteins may also be sliced 
and spliced. Some protein modifications result in natural folds, twists, and 
turns, but sometimes the protein needs help forming its correct conforma-
tion. That’s what chaperones are for.
Chaperones are molecules that mold the protein into shape. Chaperones push 
and pull the protein chains until the appropriate radical groups are close 
enough to one another to form chemical bonds. This sort of folding is called 
a tertiary structure.

When two or more polypeptide chains are hooked to make a single protein, 
they’re said to have a fourth degree, or quaternary structure. For example, 
the hemoglobin protein that carries oxygen in your blood is a well-studied 
protein with a quaternary structure. Two pairs of polypeptide chains form 
a single hemoglobin protein. The chains, two called alpha-globin chains and 
two called beta-globin chains, each form helices, which you can see in Figure 
10-8, that wind around and fold back on themselves into tertiary structures. 
Associated with the tertiary structures are iron-rich heme groups that have 
a strong affinity for oxygen. For more on how good proteins go bad, flip to

Gene Expression: 
What a Cute Pair of Genes
In This Chapter
▶ Confining gene activities to the right places
▶ Scheduling genes to do certain jobs
▶ Controlling genes before and after transcription
E
very cell in your body (with very few exceptions) carries the entire set of 
genetic instructions that make, well, everything about you. Your eye cells 
contain the genes for growing hair. Your nerve cells contain the genes that turn 
on cell division — yet your nerve cells don’t divide (under normal conditions; 
see Chapter 14 for what happens when things go wrong). Genes that are sup-
posed to be active in certain cells are turned on only when needed and then 
turned off again, like turning off the light in a room when you leave.
So why, then, aren’t your eyeballs hairy? It boils down to gene expression. Gene 
expression is how genes make their products at the right time and in the right 
place. This chapter examines how your genes work and what controls them.
Getting Your Genes Under Control
 
Gene expression occurs throughout an organism’s life, starting at the very 
beginning. When an organism develops — first as a zygote (the fertilized egg) 
and later as an embryo and fetus — genes turn on to regulate the process. At 
first, all the cells are exactly alike, but that characteristic quickly changes. 
(Cells that have the ability to turn into any kind of tissue are totipotent; see 
Chapter 20 for more on totipotency.) Cells get instructions from their DNA to 
turn into certain kinds of tissues, such as skin, heart, and bone. After the 
tissue type is decided, certain genes in each cell become active, and others 
get permanently turned off. That’s because gene expression is highly tissue-
specific, meaning certain genes are active only in certain tissues or at particu-
lar stages of development.

158
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
In part, the tissue-specific nature of gene expression is because of location — 
genes in cells respond to cues from the cells around them. Other than loca-
tion, some genes respond to cues from the environment; other genes are set 
up to come on and then turn off at a certain stage of development. Take the 
genes that code for hemoglobin, for example.
 
Your genome (your complete set of genetic information) contains a large 
group of genes that all code for various components that make up the big pro-
tein, called hemoglobin, that carries oxygen in your blood. Hemoglobin is a 
complex structure comprised of two different types of proteins that are folded 
and joined together in pairs. During your development, nine different hemo-
globin genes interacted at different times to make three kinds of hemoglobin. 
Changing conditions make it necessary for you to have three different sorts of 
hemoglobin at different stages of your life.
 
When you were still an embryo, your hemoglobin was composed mostly of epsi-
lon-hemoglobin (Greek letters are used to identify the various types of hemoglo-
bin). After about three months of development, the epsilon-hemoglobin gene 
was turned off in favor of two fetal hemoglobin genes (alpha and gamma). (Fetal 
hemoglobin is comprised of two proteins — two alphas and two gammas — 
folded and joined together as one functional piece.) When you were born, the 
gene producing the gamma-hemoglobin was shut off, and the beta-hemoglobin 
gene, which works for the rest of your life, kicked in.
Heat and light
Organisms have to respond quickly to changing 
conditions in order to survive. When external 
conditions turn on genes, it’s called induction. 
Responses to heat and light are two types of 
induction that scientists understand particularly 
well.
When an organism is exposed to high tem-
peratures, a suite of genes immediately kicks 
into action to produce heat-shock proteins. 
Heat has the nasty effect of mangling proteins 
so that they’re unable to function properly, 
referred to as denaturing. Heat-shock proteins 
are produced by roughly 20 different genes 
and act to prevent other proteins from becom-
ing denatured. Heat-shock proteins can also 
repair protein damage and refold proteins to 
bring them back to life. Heat-shock responses 
are best studied in fruit flies, but humans have 
a large number of heat-shock genes, too. These 
genes protect you from the effects of stress and 
pollutants.
Your daily rhythms of sleeping and waking 
are controlled, in part, by light. Even cancer 
may have a connection to light. When you’re 
exposed to light during nighttime, your normal 
production of melatonin (a hormone that regu-
lates sleep, among other things) is disrupted. In 
turn, a gene called period (so named because 
it controls circadian rhythms) is inactivated. 
Altered activity by the period gene is linked to 
breast cancer as well as depressed immune 
function. The increased incidence of breast 
cancer in women working the night shift was 
so dramatic that the researchers deemed night-
shift work as a probable carcinogen.

 Chapter 11: Gene Expression: What a Cute Pair of Genes
The genes controlling the production of all these hemoglobins are on two 
chromosomes, 11 and 16 (see Figure 11-1). The genes on both chromosomes 
are turned on in order, starting at the 5’ end of the group for embryonic 
hemoglobin (see Chapter 6 for how DNA is set up with numbered ends). 
Adult hemoglobin is produced by the last set of genes on the 3’ end.

Transcriptional Control 
of Gene Expression
Most gene control in eukaryotes, like you and me, occurs during transcrip-
tion. I cover the basic transcription process in Chapter 9; this section covers 
how and when transcription is carried out to control when genes are and 
aren’t expressed.
 
When a gene is “on,” it’s being transcribed. When the gene is “off,” transcrip-
tion is suspended. The only way that proteins (the stuff phenotype is made of; 
see Chapter 10) can be produced during translation is through the work of 
messenger RNA (mRNA). Transcription produces the mRNAs used in transla-
tion; therefore, when transcription is happening, translation is in motion, and 

160
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
gene expression is on. When transcription is stopped, gene expression is shut 
down, too. The timing of transcription can be controlled by a number of fac-
tors, including
 
✓ DNA accessibility
 
✓ Regulation from other genes
 
✓ Signals sent to genes from other cells by way of hormones
 
DNA must unwind a bit from its tight coils in order to be available for tran-
scription to occur.
Tightly wound: The effect 
of DNA packaging
The default state of your genes is off, not on. Starting in the off position 
makes sense when you remember that almost every cell in your body con-
tains a complete set of all your genes. You just can’t have every gene in every 
cell flipped on and running amok all the time; you want specific genes acting 
only in the tissues where their actions are needed. Therefore, keeping genes 
turned off is every bit as important as turning them on.
Genes are kept in the off position in two ways:
 
✓ Tight packaging: DNA packaging is a highly effective mechanism to 
make sure that most genes are off most of the time because it prevents 
transcription from occurring by preventing transcription factors from 
getting access to the genes. DNA is an enormous molecule, and the only 
way it can be scrunched down small enough to fit into your cell’s nuclei 
is by being tightly wound round and round itself in supercoils. First, the 
DNA is wrapped around special proteins called histones. Then, the DNA 
and the histones, which together look a bit like beads on a string, are 
wrapped around and around themselves to form the dense DNA known 
as chromatin. When DNA is wrapped up this way, it can’t be transcribed, 
because transcription factors can’t bind to the DNA to find the template 
strand and copy it. This is the heart of epigenetics (see Chapter 4).
 
✓ Repressors: Repressors are proteins that prevent transcription by bind-
ing to the same DNA sites that transcription activators would normally 
use or by interfering with the activities of the group of enzymes that 
kick off transcription (called the holoenzyme complex; see Chapter 9). 
In either case, DNA is prevented from unwinding, and the genes are kept 
turned off.
But genes can’t stay off forever. Certain sections of DNA come prepackaged 
for unwinding, allowing the genes in those areas to be turned on more easily 
whenever they’re needed.

161
 Chapter 11: Gene Expression: What a Cute Pair of Genes
To find out which genes are prepackaged for unwrapping, researchers 
exposed DNA to an enzyme called DNase I, which actually digests DNA. 
DNase I isn’t a part of normal transcription; instead, it provides a signal 
to geneticists that a region of packaged DNA is less tightly wound than 
regions around it. Geneticists added DNase I to DNA to see which parts of 
the genome were sensitive to being degraded by the enzyme’s activity. The 
sections of DNA left behind in these experiments contained genes that were 
always turned off in the tissue type the cell belonged to. The parts that were 
digested weren’t tightly wound and thus harbored the genes that could be 
turned on when needed.
 
To turn genes on, the DNA must be removed from its packaging. To unwrap 
DNA from the nucleosomes, specific proteins must bind to the DNA to unwind 
it. Lots of proteins — including transcription factors, collectively known as 
chromatin-remodeling complexes — carry out the job of unwinding DNA 
depending on the needs of the organism. Most of these proteins attach to a 
region near the gene to be activated and push the histones aside to free up the 
DNA for transcription. As soon as the DNA is available, transcription factors, 
which in some types of cells are always lurking around, latch on and immedi-
ately get to work. As I explain in Chapter 9, transcription gets started when a 
group of enzymes called the holoenzyme complex binds to the promoter 
sequence of the DNA. Promoter sequences are part of the genes they control 
and are found a few bases away. Transcription activator proteins are part of the 
mix. These proteins help get all the right components in place at the gene at 
the right moment. Transcription activators also have the ability to shove his-
tones out of the way to make the DNA template available for transcription.
Genes controlling genes
Four types of genes micromanage the activities of other genes. In this sec-
tion, I divide these genes up into two groups based on how they relate to one 
another.
Micromanaging transcription
Three types of genes act as regulatory agents to turn transcription up 
(enhancers), turn it down (silencers), or drown out the effects of enhancing 
or silencing elements (insulators).
 
✓ Enhancers: This type of gene sequence turns on transcription and 
speeds it up, making transcription happen faster and more often. 
Enhancers can be upstream, downstream, or even smack in the middle 
of the transcription unit. Furthermore, enhancers have the unique abil-
ity to control genes that are distantly located (like thousands of bases 
away) from the enhancer’s position. Nonetheless, enhancers are very 
tissue-specific in their activities — they only influence genes that are 
normally activated in that particular cell type.

162
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
 
 Researchers are still working to get a handle on how enhancers do their 
jobs. Like the proteins that turn transcription on, enhancers seem to 
have the ability to rearrange nucleosomes and pave the way for tran-
scription to occur. The enhancer teams up with transcription factors to 
form a complex called the enhanceosome. The enhanceosome attracts 
chromatin-remodeling proteins to the team along with RNA polymerase 
to allow the enhancer to supervise transcription directly.
 
✓ Silencers: These are gene sequences that hook up with repressor pro-
teins to slow or stop transcription. Like enhancers, silencers can be 
many thousands of bases away from the genes they control. Silencers 
work to keep the DNA tightly packaged and unavailable for transcription.
 
✓ Insulators: Sometimes called boundary elements, these sequences have 
a slightly different job. Insulators work to protect some genes from 
the effects of silencers and enhancers, confining the activity of those 
sequences to the right sets of genes. Usually, this protection means that 
the insulator must be positioned between the enhancer (or silencer) and 
the genes that are off limits to the enhancer’s (or silencer’s) activities.
Given that enhancers and silencers are often far away from the genes they 
control, you may be wondering how they’re able to do their jobs. Most genet-
icists think that the DNA must loop around to allow enhancers and silencers 
to come in close proximity to the genes they influence. Figure 11-2 illustrates 
this looping action. The promoter region begins with the TATA box and 
extends to the beginning of the gene itself. Enhancers interact with the pro-
moter region to regulate transcription.

Jumping genes: Transposable elements
Some genes like to travel. They hop around from place to place, inserting 
themselves into a variety of locations, causing mutations in genes, and chang-
ing the ways other genes do business. These wanderers are called transpos-
able elements (TEs), and they’re quite common — 50 percent of your DNA is 
made up of transposable elements, also known as jumping genes.

163
 Chapter 11: Gene Expression: What a Cute Pair of Genes
 
Barbara McClintock discovered TEs in 1948. She called them controlling ele-
ments because they control gene expression of other genes. McClintock was 
studying the genetics of corn when she realized that genes with a habit of fre-
quently changing location were controlling kernel color. In her research, these 
genes showed up first on one chromosome, but in another individual, the 
genes mapped to a completely different chromosome. (You can find out more 
about Dr. McClintock in Chapter 22.)
It appears that TEs travel at will, showing up whenever and wherever they 
please. How they pull off this trick isn’t completely clear, because TEs have 
several options when it comes to travel. They take advantage of breaks in 
DNA, but not just any break will do — the break must include little overhang-
ing bits of single-stranded DNA (see Figure 11-3). Some TEs replicate them-
selves to hop into the broken spots. Others, which go by the special name 
retrotransposons, make use of RNA to do the job.

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Retrotransposons are transcribed just like all other DNA: An RNA transcript 
is produced. But then the RNA transcript is transcribed again by a special 
enzyme to make a double-stranded DNA copy of the RNA transcript. Because 
the result is a DNA copy made from an RNA transcript, the process used 
by retrotransposons is called reverse transcription. The DNA copy is then 
inserted into a break, and the newly copied retrotransposon makes itself 
comfortable.
Hormones turn genes on
 
Hormones are complex chemicals that control gene expression. They’re 
secreted by a wide range of tissues in the brain, gonads (organs or glands, 
such as ovaries and testes, that produce reproductive cells), and other glands 
throughout the body. Hormones circulate in the bloodstream and can affect 
tissues far away from the hormones’ production sites. In this way, they can 
affect genes in many different tissues simultaneously. Essentially, hormones 
act like a master switch for gene regulation all over the body. Take a look at 
the sidebar “Hormones make your genes go wild” for more about the effects 
hormones have on your body.
Some hormones are such large molecules that they often can’t cross into 
the cells directly. These large hormone molecules rely on receptor proteins 
inside the cell to transmit their messages for them in a process called signal 
transduction. Other hormones, like steroids, are fat-soluble and small, so they 
easily pass directly into the cell to hook up with receptor proteins. Receptor 
proteins (and hormones small enough to enter the cell on their own) form a 
complex that moves into the cell nucleus to act as a transcription factor to 
turn specific genes on.
Hormones make your genes go wild
Dioxins are long-lived chemicals that are 
released into the environment through incinera-
tion of waste, coal-burning power plants, paper 
manufacturing, and metal smelting operations, 
to name a few. It turns out that dioxin can mimic 
estrogens and turn on genes all by itself. That’s 
scary because it means that dioxin can cause 
cancer and birth defects.
Dioxin is a chemical with an unfortunate affin-
ity for fat. Animals store dioxin in their fat cells, 
so most of the dioxins you’re exposed to come 
in the food you eat. Meats and dairy products 
are the worst offenders, but fatty fish some-
times contain elevated levels, too. It’s long 
been known that dioxins affect estrogens, the 
hormones that control reproduction in women 
and, to some degree, men, too. The good news 
is that dioxin levels are on the decline. Dioxin 
emissions have declined by 90 percent over 
the last 18 years. Unfortunately, dioxin that’s 
already present in the environment breaks 
down slowly, so it’s likely to persist for some 
time to come.

165
 Chapter 11: Gene Expression: What a Cute Pair of Genes
The genes that react to hormone signals are controlled by DNA sequences 
called hormone response elements (HREs). HREs sit close to the genes they 
regulate and bind with the hormone-receptor complex. Several HREs can 
influence the same gene — in fact, the more HREs present, the faster tran-
scription takes place in that particular gene.
Retroactive Control: Things That 
Happen after Transcription
After genes are transcribed into mRNA, their actions can still be controlled 
by events that occur later.
A swing and a miss: 
The genetic effects of anabolic steroids
Anabolic-androgenic steroids are in the news 
a lot these days. These steroids are synthetic 
forms of testosterone, the hormone that con-
trols male sex determination (see Chapter 5). 
The anabolic aspect refers to chemicals that 
increase muscle mass; the androgenic aspect 
refers to chemicals that control gonad func-
tions such as sex drive and, in the case of men, 
sperm production. High-profile athletes, includ-
ing some famous baseball players, may have 
abused one or more of these drugs in an effort 
to improve performance. Reports also suggest 
that use of anabolic steroids is common among 
young athletes in high school and college.
Hormones like testosterone control gene 
expression. Research suggests that testoster-
one exerts its anabolic effects by depressing 
the activity of a tumor suppressor gene that pro-
duces the protein p27. When p27 is depressed 
in muscle tissue, the tissue’s cells can divide 
more rapidly, resulting in the bulky physique 
prized by some athletes. Anabolic steroids 
apparently also accelerate the effects of the 
gene that causes male pattern baldness (see 
Chapter 5); thus, men carrying that allele and 
taking anabolic steroids become permanently 
bald faster and at a younger age than normal.
Defects in tumor-suppressor genes such as p27 
are widely associated with cancer. Not only 
that, but some cancers depend on hormones to 
provide signals that tumor cells respond to (by 
multiplying). At least one study suggests that 
anabolic steroids are actually carcinogenic, 
meaning that their chemicals cause mutations 
that lead to cancer. Because illegally obtained 
steroids may also contain additional unwanted 
and potentially carcinogenic chemicals, muta-
genic chemicals may be introduced into the 
body while simultaneously depressing the 
activity of a tumor-suppressor gene. It doesn’t 
take a genius to realize that this is dangerous. 
Cancers associated with anabolic-androgenic 
steroid abuse include liver cancer, testicular 
cancer, leukemia, and prostate cancer.

166
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Nip and tuck: RNA splicing
As you discover in Chapter 9, genes have sections called exons that actually 
code for protein products. Often, in between the exons are introns, inter-
ruptions of noncoding DNA that may or may not do anything. When genes 
are transcribed, the whole thing is copied into mRNA. The mRNA transcript 
has to be edited — meaning the introns are removed — in preparation for 
translation. When multiple introns are present in the unedited transcript, 
various combinations of exons can result from the editing process. Exons can 
be edited out, too, yielding new proteins when translation rolls around. This 
creative editing process allows genes to be expressed in new ways; one gene 
can code for more than one protein. This genetic flexibility is credited for the 
massive numbers of proteins you produce relative to the number of genes 
you have (see Chapter 9 for more on the potential of gene editing).
 
One gene in which genetic flexibility is very apparent is DSCAM. Named for the 
human disorder it’s associated with — Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion 
Molecule — DSCAM may play a role in causing the mental disabilities that 
accompany Down syndrome. In fruit flies, DSCAM is a large gene with 115 
exons and at least 100 splicing sites. Altogether, DSCAM is capable of coding 
for a whopping 30,016 different proteins. However, protein production from 
DSCAM is tightly regulated; some of its products only show up during early 
Interfering RNAs knock out genes
The world of RNAi (RNA interference; see “Shut 
up! mRNA silencing”) is creating quite a splash 
in the understanding of how gene expression 
is controlled. The breakthrough moment came 
when two geneticists, Andrew Fire and Craig 
Mello, realized that by introducing certain 
double-stranded RNA molecules into round-
worms, they could shut off genes at will. It turns 
out that scientists can put the RNAi into round-
worm food and knock out gene function not only 
in the worm that eats the concoction but also in 
its offspring!
Since this discovery in 2003, geneticists have 
identified naturally occurring interfering RNAs 
in all sorts of organisms. The most well-known 
RNAi tend to be very short (only about 20 or so 
bases long) and hook up with special proteins, 
called argonautes, to regulate genes (mostly 
by silencing them). The argonaute proteins 
actually do the work, guided to the right target 
by the RNAi. RNAi finds its complementary 
mRNA (the product of the gene to be regulated), 
and the argonaute breaks down the mRNA, ren-
dering it nonfunctional. New RNAi’s are being 
discovered all the time, and their full impor-
tance in regulating genes is only just being real-
ized. Longer, noncoding RNAs (over 200 bases 
long) are also produced during transcription; 
scientists are hard at work determining what 
functions those have.
The most promising applications for RNAi are 
in gene therapy (jump to Chapter 16 for that 
discussion). Using synthetic RNAi, geneticists 
have knocked out genes in all sorts of organ-
isms, including chickens and mice. Work is also 
underway to knock out the function of genes in 
viruses and cancer cells.

167
 Chapter 11: Gene Expression: What a Cute Pair of Genes
stages of fly development. The human version of DSCAM is less showy in that 
it makes only a few proteins, but other genes in the human genome are likely 
to be as productive at making proteins as DSCAM of fruit flies, making this a 
“fruitful” avenue of research. Humans have very few genes relative to the 
number of proteins we have in our bodies. Genes like DSCAM may help geneti-
cists understand how a few genes can work to produce many proteins.
With scientists wise to the nip and tuck game played by mRNA, the next 
step in deciphering this sort of gene regulation is figuring out how the trick 
is done and what controls it. Researchers know that a complex of proteins 
called a spliceosome carries out much of the work in cutting and pasting 
genes together. How the spliceosome’s activities are regulated is another 
matter altogether. Knowing how it all works will come in handy though, 
because some forms of cancer, most notably pancreatic cancer, can result 
from alternative splicing run amok.
Shut up! mRNA silencing
After transcription produces mRNA, genes may be regulated through mRNA 
silencing. mRNA silencing is basically interfering with the mRNA somehow so 
that it doesn’t get translated. Scientists don’t fully understand exactly how 
organisms like you and me use mRNA silencing, called RNAi (for RNA interfer-
ence), to regulate genes. Geneticists know that most organisms use RNAi to 
stymie translation of unwanted mRNAs and that double-stranded RNA pro-
vides the signal for the initiation of RNAi, but the details are still a mystery. 
The discovery of RNAi has produced a revolution in the study of gene expres-
sion; see the sidebar “Interfering RNAs knock out genes” for more.
RNA silencing isn’t just used to regulate the genes of an organism; sometimes 
it’s used to protect an organism from the genes of viruses. When the organ-
ism’s defenses detect a double-stranded virus RNA, an enzyme called dicer 
is produced. Dicer chops the double-stranded RNA into short bits (about 20 
or 25 bases long). These short strands of RNA, now called small interfering 
RNAs (siRNAs), are then used as weapons against remaining viral RNAs. The 
siRNAs turn traitor, first pairing up with RNA-protein complexes produced 
by the host and then guiding those complexes to intact viral RNA. The viral 
RNAs are then summarily destroyed and degraded.
mRNA expiration dates
After mRNAs are sliced, diced, capped, and tailed (see Chapter 9 for how 
mRNA gets dressed up), they’re transported to the cell’s cytoplasm. From 
that moment onward, mRNA is on a path to destruction because enzymes 
in the cytoplasm routinely chew up mRNAs as soon as they arrive. Thus, 
mRNAs have a relatively short lifespan, the length of which (and therefore 
the number of times mRNA can be translated into protein) is controlled by 

168
Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
a number of factors. But the mRNA’s poly-A tail (the long string of adenines 
tacked on to the 3’ end) seems to be one of the most important features in 
controlling how long mRNA lasts. Key aspects of the poly-A tail include:
 
✓ Tail length: The longer the tail, the more rounds of translation an mRNA 
can support. If a gene needs to be shut off rapidly, the poly-A tail is usu-
ally pretty short. With a short tail, when transcription comes to a halt, 
all the mRNA in the cytoplasm is quickly used up without replacement, 
thus halting protein production, too.
 
✓ Untranslated sequences before the tail: Many mRNAs with very short 
lives have sequences right before the poly-A tail that, even though they 
aren’t translated, shorten the mRNA’s lifespan.
Hormones present in the cell may also affect how quickly mRNAs disappear. 
In any event, the variation in mRNA expiration dates is enormous. Some 
mRNAs last a few minutes, meaning those genes are tightly regulated; other 
mRNAs hang around for months at a time.
Gene Control Lost in Translation
Translation of mRNA into amino acids is a critical step in gene expression. 
(Flip to Chapter 10 for a review of the players and process of translation.) But 
sometimes genes are regulated during or even after translation.
Modifying where translation occurs
One way gene regulation is enforced is by hemming in mRNAs in certain parts 
of the cytoplasm. That way, proteins produced by translation are found only 
in certain parts of the cell, limiting their utility. Embryos use this strategy to 
direct their own development. Proteins are produced on different sides of the 
egg to create the front and back, so to speak, of the embryo.
Modifying when translation occurs
Just because an mRNA gets to the cytoplasm doesn’t mean it automatically 
gets translated. Some gene expression is limited by certain conditions that 
block translation from occurring. For example, an unfertilized egg contains 

169
 Chapter 11: Gene Expression: What a Cute Pair of Genes
lots of mRNAs supplied by the female. Translation actually occurs in the 
unfertilized egg, but it’s slow and selective. All that changes when a sperm 
comes along and fertilizes the egg: Preexisting mRNAs are slurped up by wait-
ing ribosomes, which are signaled by the process of fertilization. New pro-
teins are then rapidly produced from the maternal mRNAs.
Controlling gene expression by controlling translation occurs in one of two 
ways:
 
✓ The machinery that carries out translation, such as the initiator proteins 
that interact with ribosomes, is modified to increase or decrease how 
effectively translation occurs.
 
✓ mRNA carries a message that controls when and how it gets translated.
All mRNAs carry short sequences on their 5’ ends that aren’t translated, and 
these sequences can carry messages about the timing of translation. The 
untranslated sequences are recognized with the help of translation initiation 
factors that help assemble the ribosome at the start codon of the mRNA. 
Some cells produce mRNAs but delay translation until certain conditions are 
met. Some cells respond to levels of chemicals that the cell’s exposed to. For 
example, the protein that binds to iron in the blood is created by translation 
only when iron is available, even though the mRNAs are being produced all 
the time. In other cases, the condition of the organism sends the message 
that controls the timing of translation. For example, insulin, the hormone that 
regulates blood sugar levels, controls translation, but when insulin’s absent, 
the translation factors lock up the needed mRNAs and block translation from 
occurring. When insulin arrives on the scene, the translation factors release 
the mRNAs, and translation rolls on, unimpeded.
Modifying the protein shape
The proteins produced by translation are the ultimate form of gene expres-
sion. Protein function, and thus gene expression, can be modified in two 
ways: by changing the protein’s shape or by adding components to the pro-
tein. The products of translation, the amino acid chains, can be folded in vari-
ous ways to affect their functions (see Chapter 9 for how amino acid chains 
are folded). Various components — carbohydrate chains, phosphates, and 
metals such as iron — can be added to the chain, also changing its function. 
Occasionally, the folding of proteins can go horribly wrong; for an explana-
tion of one of the scariest products of this type of error, mad cow disease, 
check out the sidebar “Proteins gone wrong.”

Part II: DNA: The Genetic Material 
Proteins gone wrong
Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a frightening 
disorder of the brain. Sufferers first experience 
memory loss and anxiety, and they ultimately 
develop tremors and lose intellectual func-
tion. CJD is the human form of what’s popularly 
known as mad cow disease. The pathogen isn’t 
a bacteria, virus, or parasite — it’s an infec-
tious protein called a prion. One of the scariest 
aspects of prions is that they seem to be able 
to replicate on their own by hijacking normal 
proteins and refolding them.
The gene that codes for the prion protein is 
found in many different organisms, including 
humans. After it’s mutated (and what the unmu-
tated version does isn’t really clear), the protein 
produced by the gene folds into an unusual, flat-
tened sheet. After one prion protein is acquired, 
that prion can hijack the normal products of 
unmutated prion genes, turning them into mis-
folded monsters, too. Prion proteins gum up the 
brain of the affected organism and eventually 
have fatal results. As if this outcome weren’t 
frightening enough, it seems that prions can 
jump from one species to another.
Scientists are fairly certain that some of the 
cows originally infected by mad cow disease 
contracted it by eating feed contaminated 
by sheep meat. The deceased sheep were 
infected with a prion that causes yet another 
icky disease called scrapie, which destroys the 
brains of infected animals. Scientists believe 
that when humans consume beef products from 
cows affected by mad cow disease, the prions 
in the meat can migrate through the human 
body and continue doing their dirty work.

enetics affects your everyday life. Viruses, bacteria,

roots in DNA. That’s why as soon as scientists uncovered 
the chemical nature of DNA, the race was on to read the 
code directly.
Genetic information is used to track, diagnose, and treat 
genetic diseases. The chapters in this part help you 
unravel the mysterious connections between DNA and 
your health. I explain how genetic counselors read your 
family tree to help you better understand your family 
medical history. I cover the ways in which mutations alter 
genes and the consequences of those changes. And 
because serious problems arise when chromosomes 
aren’t doled out in the usual way — leading to too many 
or too few — I explain what the numbers mean. Finally, I

f you’re thinking of starting a family or adding to your brood, you may be 
wondering what your little ones will look like. Will they get your eyes or 
your dad’s hairline? If you know your family’s medical history, you may also 
have significant worries about diseases such as cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs, 
or sickle cell anemia. You may worry about your own health, too, as you 
contemplate news stories dealing with cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, 
for example. All these concerns revolve around genetics and the inheritance 
of a predisposition for a particular disease or the inheritance of the disorder 
itself.
Genetic counselors are specially and rigorously trained to help people learn 
about the genetic aspects of their family medical histories. This chapter 
explains the process of genetic counseling, including how counselors gener-
ate family trees and estimate probability of inheritance and how genetic test-
ing is done when genetic disorders are anticipated.
Getting to Know Genetic Counselors
Like it or not, you have a family. You have a mother and a father, grandpar-
ents, and perhaps children of your own. You may not think of them, but you 
also have hundreds of ancestors — people you’ve never met — whose genes 
you carry and may pass down to descendants in the centuries to come.
Genetic counselors help people like you and me examine our families’ 
genetic histories and uncover inherited conditions. They work with medi-
cal personnel like physicians and nurses to interpret medical histories of 
patients and their families. Although they aren’t trained as geneticists, they 
usually hold a master’s degree in genetic counseling and have an extensive 
background in genetics (and can solve genetics problems in a snap; see 

174
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Chapters 3 through 5 for some examples) so that they can spot patterns 
that signal an inherited disorder. (For more on genetic counselors and 
other career paths in genetics, see Chapter 1.)
Genetics counselors perform a number of functions, including
 
✓ Constructing and interpreting family trees, sometimes called pedigrees, 
to assess the likelihood that various inherited conditions will be (or 
have been) passed on to a particular generation.
 
✓ Counseling families about options for diagnosis and treatment of genetic 
conditions.
Physicians most commonly refer the following types of people or patients to 
genetic counselors:
 
✓ Couples who are concerned about exposure to substances known to 
cause birth defects (such as radiation, viruses, drugs, and chemicals)
 
✓ Couples who have experienced more than one miscarriage or stillbirth 
or who have problems with infertility
 
✓ Parents of a child who shows symptoms of a genetic disorder
 
✓ People with a family history of a particular disorder, such as cystic fibro-
sis, who are planning a family
 
✓ People with a family history of inherited diseases like Parkinson disease 
or certain cancers such as breast, ovarian, or colon cancer who may be 
considering genetic testing to determine their risk of getting the disease
 
✓ Women over 35 who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy
 
✓ Women who have had an abnormal screening test, such as an ultra-
sound, during a pregnancy
 
I cover many of the scientific reasons for the inheritance of genetic disorders 
elsewhere in this book. Mutations within genes are the root cause of many 
genetic disorders (including cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, and sickle cell 
anemia), and I cover mutation in detail in Chapter 13. I discuss the causes and 
genetic mechanics of cancer in Chapter 14. I explain chromosomal disorders 
such as Down syndrome, trisomy 13, and fragile X syndrome in Chapter 15. 
Finally, I cover gene therapy treatments for inherited disorders in Chapter 16.
Building and Analyzing a Family Tree
Often the first step in genetic counseling is drawing a family tree. The tree 
usually starts with the person for whom the tree is initiated; this person is 
called the proband. The proband can be a newly diagnosed child, a woman 
planning a pregnancy, or an otherwise healthy person who’s curious about 

175
 Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling
risk for inherited disease. Often, the proband is simply the person who meets 
with the genetic counselor and provides the information used to plot out the 
family tree. The proband’s position in the family tree is always indicated by 
an arrow, and he or she may or may not be affected by an inherited disorder.
Genetic counselors use a variety of symbols on family trees to indicate per-
sonal traits and characteristics. For instance, certain symbols convey sex, 
gene carriers, whether the person is deceased, and whether the person’s 
family history is unknown. The manner in which symbols are connected 
show relationships among people, such as which offspring belong to which 
parents, whether someone is adopted, and whether someone is a twin. Check 
out Figure 12-1 for a detailed key to the symbols typically used in pedigree 
analysis.

In a typical pedigree, the age or date of birth of each person is noted on 
the tree. If deceased, the person’s age at the time of death and the cause of 
death are listed. Some genetic traits are more common in certain regions 
of the world, so it’s useful to include all kinds of other details about family 
history on the pedigree, such as what countries people immigrated from 
or how they’re related. Every member of the family should be listed, along 
with any medical information known about that person, including the age at 
which certain medical disorders occurred. In the example in Figure 12-1, the 

176
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
grandfather of the proband died of a heart attack at age 51. Including this 
information creates a record of all disorders with the relation to the family 
tree so that the counselor is more likely to detect every inherited disease 
present in the family. (Medical information doesn’t appear in Figure 12-1, 
but it’s normally a part of a tree.)
Medical problems often listed on pedigrees include
 
✓ Alcoholism or drug addiction
 
✓ Asthma
 
✓ Birth defects, miscarriages, or stillbirths
 
✓ Cancer
 
✓ Heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke
 
✓ Kidney disease
 
✓ Mental illness or mental retardation
Human couples have only a few children relative to other creatures, and 
humans start producing offspring after a rather long childhood. Geneticists 
rarely see neat offspring ratios (such as four siblings with three affected 
and one unaffected) in humans that correspond to those observed in ani-
mals (take a look at Chapters 3 and 4 for more on common offspring ratios). 
Therefore, genetic counselors must look for very subtle signs to detect par-
ticular patterns of inheritance in humans.
When the genetic counselor knows what kind of disorder or trait is involved, 
he or she can determine the likelihood a particular person will possess the 
trait or pass it on to his or her children. (Sometimes, the disorder is uniden-
tified, such as when a person has a family history of “heart trouble” but 
doesn’t have a precise diagnosis.) Genetic counselors use the following terms 
to describe the individuals in a pedigree:
 
✓ Affected: Any person having a given disorder.
 
✓ Heterozygote: Any person possessing one copy of the mutated gene 
coding for a disorder (an allele; see Chapter 2 for details). An unaffected 
heterozygote is called a carrier.
 
✓ Homozygote: Any person possessing two copies of the allele for a disor-
der. This person can also be described as homozygous.
The particular way in which most human genetic disorders are passed down 
to later generations — the mode of inheritance — is well established. After a 
genetic counselor determines which family members are affected or are likely 
to be carriers, it’s relatively easy to determine the probability of another 
person being a carrier or inheriting the disorder.

177
 Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling
In the following sections, I explore the modes of inheritance for human 
genetic disorders, how genetic counselors map these modes, and how you 
(and your counselor) can figure out the probability of passing these traits 
on to offspring. For additional background on each of these modes of inheri-
tance and the subject of inheritance in general, see Chapters 3 through 5.
Autosomal dominant traits
A dominant trait or disorder is one that’s expressed (or manifested) in 
anyone who inherits the mutation for the trait. Autosomal dominant means 
that the gene is carried on a chromosome other than a sex chromosome 
(meaning not on an X or a Y; see Chapter 3 for more details). In human pedi-
grees, autosomal dominant traits have some typical characteristics:
 
✓ Affected children are born to an affected parent.
 
✓ Both males and females are affected with equal frequency.
 
✓ If neither parent is affected, usually no child is affected.
 
✓ The trait doesn’t skip generations.
Figure 12-2 shows the pedigree of a family with an autosomal dominant trait. 
In the figure, affected persons are shaded, and you can clearly see how only 
affected parents have affected children. The trait can be passed to a child from 
either the mother or the father. Generally, affected parents have a 50-percent 
chance of passing an autosomal dominant trait or disorder on to each child.
Some common autosomal dominant disorders are
 
✓ Achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism
 
✓ Huntington disease, a progressive and fatal disease affecting the brain 
and nervous system
 
✓ Marfan syndrome, a disorder affecting the skeletal system, heart, and eyes
 
✓ Polydactyly, or extra fingers and toes
The normal pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance has three exceptions:
 
✓ Reduced penetrance: Penetrance is the percentage of individuals 
having a particular gene (genotype) that actually display the physi-
cal characteristics dictated by the gene (or express the gene as phe-
notype, scientifically speaking; see Chapter 3 for a full rundown of 
genetics terms). Many autosomal dominant traits have complete 
penetrance, meaning that every person inheriting the gene shows the 
trait. But some traits have reduced penetrance, meaning only a certain 
percentage of individuals inheriting the gene show the phenotype. 

178
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
When an autosomal dominant disorder shows reduced penetrance, the 
phenotype skips generations. Check out Chapter 3 for more details on 
reduced penetrance.
 
✓ New mutations: In the case of new mutations that are autosomal domi-
nant, the trait appears for the first time in a particular generation and 
can appear in every generation thereafter. You can flip to Chapter 13 
to find out more details about mutations — how they occur and how 
they’re passed on.
 
✓ Variable expressivity: Expressivity is the degree to which a trait is 
expressed. Some conditions may be undiagnosed in earlier generations 
because the condition is so mild, it goes undetected. Turn to Chapter 4 
to find out more about expressivity.

Autosomal recessive traits
Recessive disorders are expressed only when an individual inherits two iden-
tically altered (or mutated) copies of the gene that causes the disorder. It’s 
then said that the individual is homozygous for that gene (see Chapter 3 for 
more details on inheritance). Like autosomal dominant disorders, autosomal 
recessive disorders are coded in genes found on chromosomes other than 
sex chromosomes. In pedigrees, such as the one in Figure 12-3, autosomal 
recessive disorders typically have the following characteristics:
 
✓ Affected children are born to unaffected parents.
 
✓ Both males and females are affected equally.
 
✓ Children born to parents who share common ancestry (such as ethnic 
or religious background) are more likely to be affected than those of par-
ents with different backgrounds.
 
✓ The disorder or trait skips one or more generations, or is present only in 
a single generation (siblings).

179
 Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling
The probability of inheriting an autosomal recessive disorder varies depend-
ing on which alleles parents carry (see Chapter 3 for all the details on how 
the odds of inheritance are calculated):
 
✓ When both parents are carriers, every child born to the couple has a 25 
percent chance of being affected.
 
✓ When one parent is a carrier and the other isn’t, every child has a 50 
percent chance of being a carrier. No child will be affected.
 
✓ When one parent is a carrier and the other is affected, each child has 
a 50 percent chance of being affected. All unaffected children from the 
union will be carriers.
 
✓ When one parent is affected and the other is unaffected (and not a 
carrier), all children born to the couple will be carriers. No children will 
be affected.

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes severe lung 
and digestive problems in affected persons. As with all autosomal recessive 
disorders, if both members of a couple are carriers for cystic fibrosis, they 
have a 25 percent chance of having an affected child with each pregnancy they 
have. That’s because both the man and the woman are heterozygous for the 
allele that codes for cystic fibrosis, and each has a 50 percent probability of 
contributing the CF allele. You calculate the probability of both members of 
the couple contributing CF alleles in one fertilization event by multiplying the 
probability of each event happening independently. The probability the father 
contributes his CF allele is 50 percent, or 0.5; the probability the mother con-
tributes her CF allele is also 50 percent, or 0.5. The probability that both con-
tribute their allele is 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25, or 25 percent. For more details on how to 
calculate probabilities of inheritance, flip to Chapters 3 and 4.

180
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Some autosomal recessive disorders are more common among people of 
certain religious or ethnic groups, because people belonging to those groups 
tend to marry within the group. After many generations, everyone within 
the group shares common ancestry. When cousins or other close relatives 
marry, such relationships are referred to as consanguineous (meaning “same 
blood”). Generally, people who are more distantly related than fourth cous-
ins aren’t considered “related,” but in fact, those persons still share alleles 
from a common ancestor. When populations are founded by rather small 
groups of people, those groups often have higher rates of particular genetic 
disorders than the general population; for more details, take a look at the 
sidebar “Genetic disorders in small populations.” In these cases, autosomal 
recessive disorders may no longer skip generations, because so many per-
sons are heterozygous and thus carriers of the disorder.
X-linked recessive traits
Males are XY and therefore have only one copy of the X chromosome; they 
don’t have a second X to offset the expression of a mutant allele on the 
affected X. Thus, similar to autosomal dominant disorders, X-linked recessive 
disorders express the trait fully in males, even though they’re not homo-
zygous. Females rarely show X-linked recessive disorders, because being 
homozygous for the disorder is very rare. In pedigrees, X-linked recessive 
disorders have the following characteristics:
Genetic disorders in small populations
The Pennsylvania Amish don’t have electric-
ity in their homes, don’t drive cars, and don’t 
use e-mail or cellphones. They live simply in 
the modern world as a religious way of life. 
Because Amish people marry within their faith, 
certain genetic disorders are common. Amish 
families come by horse and buggy to the Clinic 
for Special Children in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, 
for genetic testing. By partnering with an ultra–
high-tech company, the clinic provides rapid, 
inexpensive genetic testing. Among the clinic’s 
findings is the fact that the Old Order Amish 
of southeastern Pennsylvania suffer from a 
devastating form of sudden infant death syn-
drome (SIDS). Altogether, the Belleville Amish 
community has mourned the loss of over 
21 babies (one family lost six infants to the 
disorder). Researchers at the Translational 
Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, 
Arizona, were able to locate the mutated gene 
that causes the SIDS using microarray technol-
ogy (see Chapter 23). Sadly, no treatment yet 
exists for this type of SIDS, but gene therapy 
(which I cover in Chapter 16) may offer hope for 
small populations such as the Amish.

181
 Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling
 
✓ Affected sons are born to unaffected mothers.
 
✓ Far more males than females are affected.
 
✓ The trait is never passed from father to son.
 
✓ The disorder skips one or more generations.
Unaffected parents can have unaffected daughters and one or more affected 
sons. Women who are carriers frequently have brothers with the disease, but 
if families are small, a carrier may have no affected immediate family mem-
bers. Sons of affected fathers are never affected, but daughters of affected 
fathers are always carriers, because daughters must inherit one of their X 
chromosomes from their fathers. In this case, that X chromosome will always 
carry the allele for the disorder. The pedigree in Figure 12-4 is a classic 
example of a well-researched family possessing many carriers for the X-linked 
disorder hemophilia, a devastating disorder that prevents normal clotting of 
the blood. For more on the royal families whose history is pictured in Figure 
12-4, see the sidebar “A royal pain in the genes.”
 
The probability of inheritance of X-linked disorders depends on gender. Female 
carriers have a 50 percent likelihood of passing the gene on to each child. 
Males determine the gender of their offspring, making the chance of any partic-
ular child being a boy 50 percent. Therefore, the likelihood of a carrier mom 
having an affected son is 25 percent (chance of having a son = 0.5; chance of a 
son inheriting the affected X = 0.5; therefore, 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25, or 25 percent).

X-linked dominant traits
Like autosomal dominant disorders, X-linked dominant traits don’t skip genera-
tions. Every person who inherits the allele expresses the disorder. The family 
tree in Figure 12-5 shows many of the hallmarks of X-linked dominant disorders:
 
✓ Affected mothers have both affected sons and daughters.
 
✓ Both males and females are affected.
 
✓ All daughters of affected fathers are affected.
 
✓ The trait doesn’t skip generations.
A royal pain in the genes
You can find one of the most famous examples 
of an X-linked family pedigree in the royal fami-
lies of Europe and Russia, which you can see 
in Figure 12-4. Queen Victoria of England had 
one son affected with hemophilia. It’s not clear 
whom Queen Victoria inherited the allele from; 
she may have been the victim of spontaneous 
gene mutation. In any event, two of her daugh-
ters were carriers, and she had one affected 
son, Leopold. Queen Victoria’s granddaughter 
Alexandra was also a carrier. Alexandra mar-
ried Nicholas Romanov, who became czar of 
Russia, and together they had five children: 
four daughters and one son. The son, Alexis, 
suffered from hemophilia.
The role Alexis’s disease played in his family’s 
ultimate fate is debatable. Clearly, however, 
one of the men who influenced the downfall of 
Russia’s royal family was linked to the family 
as Alexis’s “doctor.” Gregory Rasputin was a 
self-proclaimed faith healer; in photographs, 
he appears wild-eyed and deeply intense. He’s 
generally perceived to have been a fraud, but 
at the time, he had a reputation for miraculous 
healings, including helping little Alexis recover 
from a bleeding crisis. Despite Rasputin’s talent 
for healing, Alexis didn’t live to see adulthood. 
Shortly after the Russian Revolution broke out, 
the entire Russian royal family was murdered. 
(Rasputin himself had been murdered some two 
years earlier.)
In a bizarre final twist to the Romanov tale, a 
road repair crew discovered the family’s bodies 
in 1979. Oddly, two of the family members were 
missing. Eleven people were supposedly killed 
by firing squad on the night of July 16, 1918: the 
Russian royal family (Alexandra, Nicholas, and 
their five children) along with three servants 
and the family doctor. However, the bodies 
of Alexis and his little sister, Anastasia, have 
never been found. Using DNA fingerprint-
ing, researchers confirmed the identities of 
Alexandra and her children by matching their 
mitochondrial DNA to that of one of Queen 
Victoria’s living descendants, Prince Philip of 
England. (To find out more about the forensic 
uses of DNA, flip to Chapter 18.)

X-linked dominant traits show up more often in females than males because 
females can inherit an affected X from either parent. In addition, some disor-
ders are lethal in males who are hemizygous (having only one copy of the 
chromosome, not two; see Chapter 5). Affected females have a 50 percent 
chance of having an affected child of either sex. Males never pass their 
affected X to sons; therefore, sons of affected fathers and unaffected mothers 
have no chance of being affected, in contrast to daughters, who are always 
affected. The probability of an affected man having an affected child is 50 per-
cent (that is, equal to the likelihood of having a daughter).
Y-linked traits
The Y chromosome is passed strictly from father to son. By definition, 
Y-chromosome traits are considered hemizygous. Y-chromosome traits are 
expressed as if they were dominant because there’s only one copy of the 
allele per male, with no other allele to offset the effect of the gene. Y-linked 
traits are easy to recognize when seen in a pedigree, such as Figure 12-6, 
because they have the following characteristics:
 
✓ Affected men pass the trait to all their sons.
 
✓ No women are ever affected.
 
✓ The trait doesn’t skip generations.
 
Because the Y chromosome is tiny and has relatively few genes, Y-linked 
traits are very rare. Most of the genes involved control male-only traits such 
as sperm production and testis formation. If you’re female and your dad has 
hairy ears, you can relax — hairy ears is also considered a Y-linked trait.

Genetic Testing for Advance Notice
With the advent of many new technologies (some of which grew out of the 
Human Genome Project, which I explain in Chapter 8), genetic testing is easier 
and cheaper than ever. Genetic testing and genetic counseling often go hand 
in hand. The genetic counselor works to identify which disorders occur in the 
family, and testing then examines the DNA directly to determine whether the 
disorder-causing gene is present. Your physician may refer you or a family 
member for genetic testing for a variety of reasons, particularly if you
 
✓ Are a healthy person concerned about certain heritable disorders in 
your ethnic background or family such as breast cancer or Huntington 
disease
 
✓ Are a healthy person with a family history of a recessive disorder, and 
you’re thinking about having a child
 
✓ Are a pregnant woman over 35
 
✓ Are an affected person and need to confirm a diagnosis
 
✓ Have an infant who’s at risk (because his or her parents are known or 
suspected carriers)
General testing
Every person the world over carries one or more alleles that cause genetic 
disease. Most of us never know which alleles or how many we carry. If you 
have a family member who’s affected with a rare genetic disorder, particu-
larly an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance or delayed 
onset, you may be vitally concerned about which allele(s) you carry. Persons 
currently unaffected with certain disorders can seek genetic testing to learn 
if they’re carriers. Most tests involve a blood sample, but some are done with 
a simple cheek swab to capture a few skin cells. You can find more about 

185
 Chapter 12: Genetic Counseling
genetic testing for inherited disorders in Chapter 13 and about testing for 
inherited forms of cancer in Chapter 14. Genetic testing has many ethical 
implications, as I cover in Chapter 21.
Prenatal testing
Prenatal diagnosis is commonly used for unborn children of women over 
35, because such women are much more likely than younger women to have 
children with chromosomal disorders (see Chapter 15). Prenatal testing is 
designed to allow time for couples to make decisions about treatments to be 
administered either during pregnancy or after delivery of an affected infant.
Chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis
For definitive diagnosis of a genetic disorder, testing requires tissue of the 
affected person. Two common prenatal tests used to obtain fetal tissue for 
testing are chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis. Both tests 
require ultrasound to guide the instruments used to obtain the samples (see 
the following section for more info on ultrasound).
 
✓ CVS is usually done late in the first trimester of pregnancy (weeks 10 
to 12). A catheter is inserted vaginally and guided to the outer layer of 
the placenta, called the chorion. Gentle suction is used to collect a small 
sample of chorionic tissue. The placental tissue arises from the fetus, 
not the mother, so the collected cells give an accurate picture of the 
fetus’s chromosome number and genetic profile. The advantages of CVS 
are that it can be done earlier than most other prenatal genetic tests; it’s 
extremely accurate; and because a relatively large sample is obtained, 
results are rapidly produced. CVS is associated with a slightly higher 
rate of miscarriage.
 
✓ Amniocentesis is usually done early in the second trimester of preg-
nancy (weeks 15 and beyond). Amniocentesis is used to obtain a sample 
of the amniotic fluid that surrounds the growing fetus, because amni-
otic fluid contains fetal cells (skin cells that have sloughed off) that can 
be examined for prenatal testing. The fluid is drawn directly from the 
uterus using a needle inserted through the abdomen. Because fetal cells 
in the fluid are at a very low concentration, the cells must be grown in 
a lab to provide enough tissue for testing, making results slow to come 
(about one to two weeks). But the results are accurate, and complica-
tions following the procedure (such as miscarriage) are rare.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound technology allows physicians to examine a growing fetus visu-
ally, along with its spinal cord, brain, and all its organs. Ultrasound can 
be done much earlier in a woman’s pregnancy than CVS or amniocentesis. 

186
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Ultrasound directs extremely high frequency sound waves through the 
mother’s abdominal wall. The sound waves bounce off the fetus and return 
to a receiver that then converts the sound wave “picture” into a visual image. 
New ultrasound technologies include powerful computers that put together 
a three-dimensional image, giving amazingly crisp pictures of facial features 
and body parts. Ultrasound is generally used to screen for genetic disorders 
associated with physical features or deformities. Ultrasound can be used at 
any time during pregnancy and is completely non-invasive, with little or no 
risk to mother or baby.
Newborn screening
Some genetic disorders are highly treatable using dietary restrictions. 
Therefore, all newborns in the United States are tested for two common, 
highly treatable genetic disorders: phenylketonuria and galactosemia. Both of 
these disorders are autosomal recessive.
 
✓ Phenylketonuria causes mental retardation due to the buildup of 
phenylalanine (an amino acid that’s part of a normal diet) in the brain 
of affected persons. A diet low in phenylalanine allows such persons 
to live symptom-free lives. (This disorder and the potential to control 
it are the reasons certain diet colas contain warning labels regarding 
phenylalanine content.) Phenylketonuria occurs once in every 10,000 
to 20,000 births.
 
✓ Galactosemia is a disorder similar to phenylketonuria that results from 
an inability to break down one of the products of lactose (milk sugar). 
A lactose-free diet allows affected persons to live symptom-free lives. If 
untreated, galactosemia results in brain damage, kidney and liver failure, 
and often death. Galactosemia occurs once in every 45,000 births.
 
Testing for these two disorders isn’t actually genetic testing; rather, the tests 
are designed to look for the presence of abnormal amounts of either phenylal-
anine or galactose — the phenotypes of the disorders. As technologies 
advance, these tests may be replaced with direct DNA examination by gene 
chips (which you can read more about in Chapter 23).

Mutation and Inherited Diseases: 
Things You Can’t Change
In This Chapter
▶ Considering the different types and causes of mutation
▶ Realizing the consequences of and repairs for mutation
▶ Looking at some common inherited diseases
D
espite what you may think, mutation is good thing. Mutation, which 
is simply genetic change, is responsible for all phenotypic variation. 
Variation in flower colors and plant height, the flavor of different varieties of 
apples, the differences among dog breeds, you name it — the natural process 
that created all those different phenotypes is mutation. Mutation occurs all 
the time, spontaneously and pretty much randomly.
But like many good things, mutation can also be bad. It can disrupt normal 
gene activity and cause disease such as cancer (flip to Chapter 14 for details) 
and birth defects (see Chapter 15). In this chapter, you discover what causes 
mutations, how DNA can repair itself in the face of mutation, and what the 
consequences are when repair attempts fail.
Sorting Out Types of Mutations
 
Mutations fall into two major categories, and the distinction between the two 
is important to keep in mind:
 
✓ Somatic mutations: Mutations in body cells that don’t make eggs or 
sperm. Mutations that occur in the somatic cells aren’t heritable — that 
is, the changes can’t be passed from parent to offspring — but they do 
affect the person with the mutation.

188
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
 
✓ Germ-cell mutations: Mutations in the sex cells (germ cells like eggs and 
sperm; see Chapter 2 for the scoop on cell types) that lead to embryo 
formation. Unlike somatic mutations, germ-cell mutations often don’t 
affect the parent. Instead, they affect the offspring of the person with the 
mutation and are heritable from then on.
 
Some disorders have elements of both somatic and germ-cell (heritable) muta-
tions. Many cancers that run in families arise as a result of somatic mutations 
in persons who are already susceptible to the disease because of mutations 
they inherited from one or both parents. (You can find out more about herita-
ble cancers in Chapter 14.)
Both somatic and germ-cell mutations usually come about, in a general sense, 
because of
 
✓ Substitutions of one base for another: Substitutions are sometimes 
called point mutations. Usually, only one mistaken base is involved, 
although sometimes both the base and its complement are changed (for 
a review of the chemistry of DNA, turn to Chapter 6). This type of muta-
tion breaks down further into two categories:
 
• Transition mutation: When a purine base is substituted for the 
other purine, or one pyrimidine is substituted for the other pyrimi-
dine. Transition mutations are the most common form of substitu-
tion errors.
 
• Transversion mutation: When a purine replaces a pyrimidine (or 
vice versa).
 
✓ Insertions and deletions of one or more bases: When an extra base is 
added to a strand, the error is called an insertion. Dropping a base is 
considered a deletion. Insertions and deletions are the most common 
forms of mutation. When the change happens within a gene, both 
insertions and deletions lead to a change in the way the genetic code 
is read during translation (flip to Chapter 10 for a translation review). 
Translation involves reading the genetic code in three-letter batches, 
so when one or two bases are added or deleted, the reading frame is 
shifted. This frameshift mutation results in a completely different inter-
pretation of what the code says and produces an entirely different 
amino acid strand. As you can imagine, these effects have disastrous 
consequences, because the expected gene product isn’t produced. If 
three bases are added or deleted, the reading frame isn’t affected. The 
result of a three-base insertion or deletion, called an in-frame mutation, 
is that one amino acid is either added (insertion) or lost (deletion). 
In-frame mutations can be just as bad as frameshift mutations. I cover 
the consequences of these sorts of mutations in the section “Facing the 
Consequences of Mutation” later in this chapter.

189
 Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases: Things You Can’t Change
What Causes Mutation?
Mutations can occur for a whole suite of reasons. In general, though, the 
causes of mutations are either random or because of exposure to outside 
agents such as chemicals or radiation. In the sections that follow, I delve into 
each of these causes.
Spontaneous mutations
 
Spontaneous mutation occurs randomly and without any urging from some 
external cause. It’s a natural, normal occurrence. Because the vast majority of 
your DNA doesn’t code for anything, most spontaneous mutation goes unno-
ticed (check out Chapter 8 for more details about your noncoding “junk” 
DNA). But when mutation occurs within a gene, the function of the gene can 
be changed or disrupted. Those changes can then result in unwanted side 
effects (such as cancer, which I address in Chapter 14).
Scientists are all about counting, sorting, and quantifying, and it’s no different 
with mutations. Spontaneous mutations are measured in the following ways:
 
✓ Frequency: Mutations are sometimes measured by the frequency of 
occurrence. Frequency is the number of times some event occurs within 
a group of individuals. When you hear that one in some number of per-
sons has a particular disease-causing allele, the number is a frequency. 
For example, one study estimates that the X-linked disease hemophilia 
has a frequency of 13 cases for every 100,000 males.
 
✓ Rate: Another way of looking at mutations is in the framework of a rate, 
like the number of mutations occurring per round of cell division, or 
the number of mutations per gamete or per generation. Mutation rates 
appear to vary a lot from organism to organism. Even within a species, 
mutation rates vary depending on which part of the genome you’re 
examining. Some convincing studies show that mutation rate even 
varies by sex and that mutation rates are higher in males than females 
(check out the sidebar “Dad’s age matters, too” for more on this topic). 
Regardless of how it’s viewed, spontaneous mutation occurs at a steady 
but very low rate (like around one per million gametes).
 
Most spontaneous mutations occur because of mistakes made during replica-
tion (all the details of how DNA replicates itself are in Chapter 7). Here are the 
three main sources of error that can happen during replication:

190
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
 
✓ Mismatched bases are overlooked during proofreading.
 
✓ Strand slip-ups lead to deletions or insertions.
 
✓ Spontaneous but natural chemical changes cause bases to be misread 
during replication, resulting in substitutions or deletions.
Mismatches during replication
Usually, DNA polymerase catches and fixes mistakes made during replication. 
DNA polymerase has the job of reading the template, adding the appropri-
ate complementary base to the new strand, and then proofreading the new 
base before moving to the next base on the template. DNA polymerase can 
snip out erroneous bases and replace them, but occasionally, a wrong base 
escapes detection. Such an error is possible because noncomplementary 
bases can form hydrogen bonds through what’s called wobble pairing. As you 
can see in Figure 13-1, wobble pairing can occur
 
✓ Between thymine and guanine without any modifications to either base 
(because these noncomplementary bases can sometimes form bonds in 
odd spots).
 
✓ Between cytosine and adenine only when adenine acquires an addi-
tional hydrogen atom (called protonation).

If DNA repair crews don’t catch the error and fix it (see the section 
“Evaluating Options for DNA Repair” later in this chapter), and the mis-
matched base remains in place, the mistake is perpetuated after the next 
round of replication, apparent in Figure 13-2. The mistaken base is read as 
part of the template strand, and its complement is added to the newly repli-
cated strand opposite. Thus, the mutation is permanently added to the struc-
ture of the DNA in question.

Strand slip-ups
During replication, both strands of DNA are copied more or less at the same 
time. Occasionally, a portion of one strand (either the template or the newly 
synthesized strand) can form a loop in a process called strand slippage. In 
Figure 13-3, you can see that strand slippage in the new strand results in an 
insertion, and slippage in the template strand results in a deletion.
 
Strand slippage is associated with repeating bases. When one base is repeated 
more than five times in a row (AAAAAA, for example), or when any number of 
bases are repeated over and over (such as AGTAGTAGT), strand slippage 
Dad’s age matters, too
The relationship between maternal age and 
an increased incidence of chromosome prob-
lems, particularly Down syndrome, is very well-
known. Nondisjunction events — the failure 
of chromosomes to separate normally during 
meiosis — in developing eggs are thought to 
be a consequence of aging in women. Very 
few similar genetic problems appear to arise 
in men, who, unlike women, produce new gam-
etes (reproductive cells) in the form of sperm 
throughout their lifetime. However, older men 
are susceptible to germ-cell mutations that can 
cause heritable disorders in their children.
The reason that older men are more suscep-
tible to spontaneous germ-cell mutations is 
the same reason that they’re less likely to 
have nondisjunctions — males produce sperm 
throughout their life. This continued sperm pro-
duction means that a 50-year-old man’s germ 
cells have replicated over 800 times. As DNA 
ages, replication gets less accurate, and repair 
mechanisms become faulty. Thus, older fathers 
have an increased risk (although it’s still only 
slight) of fathering children with genetic disor-
ders. Achondroplasia (an autosomal dominant 
form of dwarfism that’s typified by shortened 
limbs and an enlarged head), Marfan syndrome 
(a disorder of skeletal and muscle tissue that 
causes heart and eye problems) and progeria 
(a disease that causes rapid aging in children) 
are all associated with older fathers.

192
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
during replication is far more likely to occur. In some cases, the mistakes pro-
duce lots of variation in noncoding DNA, and the variation is useful for deter-
mining individual identity; this is the basis for DNA fingerprinting (see Chapter 
18 for that discussion). When repeat sequences occur within genes, the addi-
tion of new repeats can lead to a stronger effect of the gene. This strengthening 
effect, called anticipation, occurs in genetic disorders such as Huntington dis-
ease. (You can find out more about anticipation in Chapter 4.)
Another problem that repeated bases generate is unequal crossing-over. 
During meiosis, homologous chromosomes are supposed to align exactly 
so that exchanges of information are equal and don’t disrupt genes (turn 
to Chapter 2 for a meiosis review). Unequal crossing-over occurs when the 
exchange between chromosomes results in the swapping of uneven amounts 
of material. Repeated sequences cause unequal crossovers because so many 
similar bases match. The identical bases can align in multiple, matching ways 
that result in mismatches elsewhere along the chromosome. Unequal cross-
over events lead to large-scale chromosome changes (like those I describe in 
Chapter 15). Chromosomes in cells affected by cancer are also vulnerable to 
crossing-over errors (see Chapter 14 for details).

Spontaneous chemical changes
DNA can undergo spontaneous changes in its chemistry that result in both 
deletions and substitutions. DNA naturally loses purine bases at times in 
a process called apurination. Most often, a purine is lost when the bond 
between adenine and the sugar, deoxyribose, is broken. (See Chapter 6 for a 
reminder of what a nucleotide looks like.) When a purine is lost, replication 
treats the spot occupied by the orphaned sugar as if it never contained a 
base at all, resulting in a deletion.
Deamination is another chemical change that occurs naturally in DNA. It’s 
what happens when an amino group (composed of a nitrogen atom and two 
hydrogens — NH2) is lost from a base. Figure 13-4 shows the before and after 
stages of deamination. When cytosine loses its amino group, it’s converted 

193
 Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases: Things You Can’t Change
to uracil. Uracil normally isn’t found in DNA at all because it’s a component 
of RNA. If uracil appears in a DNA strand, replication replaces the uracil with 
a thymine, creating a substitution error. Until it’s snipped out and replaced 
during repair (see “Evaluating Options for DNA Repair” later in this chap-
ter), uracil acts as a template during replication and pairs with adenine. 
Ultimately, what was a C-G pair transitions into an A-T pair instead.

Induced mutations
 
Induced mutations result from exposure to some outside agent such as chemi-
cals or radiation. It probably comes as no surprise to you to find out that 
many chemicals can cause DNA to mutate. Carcinogens (chemicals that cause 
cancers) aren’t uncommon; the chemicals in cigarette smoke are probably the 
biggest offenders. In addition to chemicals that cause mutations, sources of 
radiation, from X-rays to sunlight, are also mutagenic. A mutagen is any factor 
that causes an increase in mutation rate. Mutagens may or may not have phe-
notypic effects — it depends on what part of the DNA is affected. The follow-
ing sections cover two major categories of mutagens: chemicals and radiation. 
Each causes different damage to DNA.
Chemical mutagens
The ability of chemicals to cause permanent changes in the DNA of organisms 
was discovered by Charlotte Auerbach in the 1940s (see the sidebar “The 
chemistry of mutation” for the full story). There are many types of mutagenic 
chemicals; the following sections address four of the most common.
Base analogs
Base analogs are chemicals that are structurally very similar to the bases 
normally found in DNA. Base analogs can get incorporated into DNA during 
replication because of their structural similarity to normal bases. One base 
analog, 5-bromouracil, is almost identical to the base thymine. Most often, 
5-bromouracil (also known as 5BU), which is pictured in Figure 13-5, gets 
incorporated as a substitute for thymine and, as such, is paired with adenine. 
The problem arises when DNA replicates again with 5-bromouracil as part of 
the template strand; 5BU is mistaken for a cytosine and gets mispaired with 
guanine. The series of events looks like this: 5-bromouracil is incorporated 

194
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
where thymine used to be, so T-A becomes 5BU-A. After one round of replica-
tion, the pair is 5BU-G, because 5BU is prone to chemical changes that make 
it a mimic of cytosine, the base normally paired with guanine. After a second 
round of replication, the pair ends up as C-G, because 5BU isn’t found in 
normal DNA. Thus, an A-T ends up as a C-G pair.
Another class of base analog chemicals that foul up normal base pairing is 
deaminators. Deamination is a normal process that causes spontaneous muta-
tion; however, problems arise because deamination can get speeded up when 
cells are exposed to chemicals that selectively knock out amino groups con-
verting cytosines to uracils.

Alkylating agents
Like base analogs, alkylating agents induce mispairings between bases. 
Alkylating agents, such as the chemical weapon mustard gas, add chemi-
cal groups to the existing bases that make up DNA. As a consequence, the 
altered bases pair with the wrong complement, thus introducing the mutation. 
Surprisingly, alkylating agents are often used to fight cancer as part of chemo-
therapy; therapeutic versions of alkylating agents may inhibit cancer growth 
by interfering with the replication of DNA in rapidly dividing cancer cells.
Free radicals
Some forms of oxygen, called free radicals, are unusually reactive, meaning 
they react readily with other chemicals. These oxygens can damage DNA 
directly (by causing strand breaks) or can convert bases into new unwanted 
chemicals that, like most other chemical mutagens, then cause mispairing 
during replication. Free radicals of oxygen occur normally in your body as a 
product of metabolism, but most of the time, they don’t cause any problems. 
Certain activities — such as cigarette smoking and high exposure to radia-
tion, pollution, and weed killers — increase the number of free radicals in 
your system to dangerous levels.

195
 Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases: Things You Can’t Change
Intercalating agents
Many different kinds of chemicals wedge themselves between the stacks of 
bases that form the double helix itself, disrupting the shape of the double 
helix. Chemicals with flat ring structures, such as dyes, are prone to fitting 
themselves between bases in a process called intercalation. Figure 13-6 shows 
intercalating agents at work. Intercalating agents create bulges in the double 
helix that often result in insertions or deletions during replication, which in 
turn cause frameshift mutations.

Radiation
Radiation damages DNA in a couple of different ways. First, radiation can 
break the strands of the double helix by knocking out bonds between sugars 
and phosphates (see Chapter 6 for a review of how the strands are put 
together). If only one strand is broken, the damage is easily repaired. But 
when two strands are broken, large parts of the chromosome can be lost; 
these kinds of losses can affect cancer cells (see Chapter 14) and cause birth 
defects (see Chapter 15).
Second, radiation causes mutation through the formation of dimers. Dimers 
(di- meaning “two”; mer meaning “thing”) are unwanted bonds between two 
bases stacked on top of each other (on the same side of the helix, rather than 
on opposite sides). They’re most often formed when two thymines in a DNA 
sequence bind together, which you can see in Figure 13-7.
Thymine dimers can be repaired, but if damage is extensive, the cell dies 
(see Chapter 14 for how cells are programmed to die). When dimers aren’t 
repaired, the machinery of DNA replication assumes that two thymines are 
present and puts in two adenines. Unfortunately, cytosine and thymine can 
also form dimers, so the default repair strategy sometimes introduces a 
mutation instead.

The chemistry of mutation
If ever anyone had an excuse to give up, it 
was Charlotte Auerbach. Born in Germany in 
1899, Auerbach was part of a lively and highly 
educated Jewish family. In spite of her deep 
interest in biology, she became a teacher, con-
vinced that higher education would be closed to 
her because of her religious heritage. As anti-
Jewish sentiment in Germany grew, Auerbach 
lost her teaching job in 1933 when every Jewish 
secondary-school teacher in the country was 
fired. As a result, she emigrated to Britain, 
where she earned her PhD in genetics in 1935. 
Charlotte Auerbach didn’t enjoy the respect her 
degree and abilities deserved. She was treated 
as a lab technician and instructed to clean 
the cages of experimental animals. All that 
changed when she met Herman Muller in 1938. 
Like Auerbach, Muller was interested in how 
genes work; his approach to the problem was 
to induce mutations using radiation and then 
examine the effects produced by the defective 
genes. Inspired by Muller, Auerbach began 
work on chemical mutagens. She focused her 
efforts on mustard gas, a horrifically effective 
chemical weapon used extensively during 
World War I. Her research involved heating 
liquid mustard gas and exposing fruit flies to 
the fumes. It’s a wonder her experiments didn’t 
kill her.
What Charlotte’s experiments did do was show 
that mustard gas is an alkylating agent, a muta-
gen that causes substitution mutations. Shortly 
after the end of World War II, and after perse-
vering through burns caused by hot mustard 
gas, Auerbach published her findings. At last, 
she received the recognition and respect her 
work warranted. Charlotte Auerbach went on 
to have a long and highly successful career 
in genetics. She stopped working only after 
old age robbed her of her sight. She died in 
Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1994 at the age of 95.

Facing the Consequences of Mutation
When a gene mutates and that mutation is passed along to the next genera-
tion, the new, mutated version of the gene is considered a new allele. Alleles 
are simply alternative forms of genes. For most genes, many alleles exist. The 
effects of mutations that create new alleles are compared with the mutations’ 
physical (phenotypic) effects. If a mutation has no effect, it’s considered silent. 
Most silent mutations result from the redundancy of the genetic code. The 
code is redundant in the sense that multiple combinations of bases have identi-
cal meanings (see Chapter 9 for more about the redundancy of genetic code).
Sometimes, mutations cause a completely different amino acid to be put in 
during translation. Mutations that actually alter the code are called missense 
mutations. A nonsense mutation occurs when a message to stop translation 
(called a stop codon) is introduced into the middle of the sequence. The intro-
duction of the stop codon usually means the gene stops functioning altogether.
Mutations are often divided into two types:
 
✓ Neutral: When the amino acid produced from the mutated gene still cre-
ates a fully functional, normal protein (via translation; see Chapter 9).
 
✓ Functional change: When a new protein is created representing a 
change in function of the gene. A gain-of-function mutation creates an 
entirely new trait or phenotype. Sometimes, the new trait is harmless, 
like a new eye color. In other cases, the gain is decidedly harmful and 
usually autosomal dominant (flip to Chapter 12 for more on autosomal 
dominant traits) because the gene is producing a new protein that actu-
ally does something (the gain-of-function part). Even though there’s only 
one copy of the new allele, its effect is noticeable and thus considered 
dominant over the original, unmutated allele.
 
 If a mutation causes the gene to stop functioning altogether or vastly 
alters normal function, it’s considered a loss-of-function mutation. All non-
sense mutations are loss-of-function mutations, but not all loss-of-function 
mutations are the result of nonsense mutations. The usefulness of the pro-
tein made from a particular gene can be lost, even when no stop codon 
has been added prematurely. Insertions and deletions are often loss-of-
function mutations because they cause frameshifts (Chapter 9 explains 
how the genetic code is read in frames). Frameshifts cause an entirely new 
set of amino acids to be put together from the new set of instructions. 
Most of the time, these new proteins are useless and nonfunctional. Loss-
of-function mutations are usually recessive because the normal, unmu-
tated allele is still producing product — usually enough to compensate for 
the mutated allele. Loss-of-function mutations are only detected when a 
person is homozygous for the mutation and is making no functional gene 
product at all.

Evaluating Options for DNA Repair
Mutations in your DNA can be repaired in four major ways:
 
✓ Mismatch repair: Incorrect bases are found, removed, and replaced with 
the correct, complementary base. Most of the time, DNA polymerase, 
the enzyme that helps make new DNA, immediately detects mismatched 
bases put in by mistake during replication. DNA polymerase can back up 
and correct the error without missing a beat. But if a mismatched base 
gets put in some other way (through strand slip-ups, for example), a set 
of enzymes that are constantly scrutinizing the double strand to detect 
bulges or constrictions signals a mismatched base pair. The mismatch 
repair enzymes can detect any differences between the template and the 
newly synthesized strand, so they clip out the wrong base and, using the 
template strand as a guide, insert the correct base.
 
✓ Direct repair: Bases that are modified in some way (like when oxidation 
converts a base to some new form) are converted back to their original 
states. Direct repair enzymes look for bases that have been converted to 
some new chemical, usually by the addition of some unwanted group of 
atoms. Instead of using a cut-and-paste mechanism, the enzymes clip off 
the atoms that don’t belong, converting the base back to its original form.
 
✓ Base-excision repair: Base-excisions and nucleotide-excisions (check 
out the next bullet) work in much the same way. Base-excisions occur 
when an unwanted base (such as uracil; see the section “Spontaneous 
chemical changes” earlier in this chapter) is found. Specialized enzymes 
recognize the damage, and the base is snipped out and replaced with 
the correct one.
 
✓ Nucleotide-excision repair: Nucleotide-excision means that the entire 
nucleotide (and sometimes several surrounding nucleotides as well) 
gets removed all at once. When intercalating agents or dimers distort 
the double helix, nucleotide-excision repair mechanisms step in to snip 
part of the strand, remove the damage, and synthesize fresh DNA to 
replace the damaged section.
 
 As with base excision, specialized enzymes recognize the damaged sec-
tion of the DNA. The damaged section is removed, and newly synthe-
sized DNA is laid down to replace it. In nucleotide-excision, the double 
helix is opened up, much like it is during replication (which I cover 
in Chapter 7). The sugar-phosphate backbone of the damaged strand 
is broken in two places to allow removal of that entire portion of the 
strand. DNA polymerase synthesizes a new section, and DNA ligase seals 
the breaks in the strand to complete the repair process.

Examining Common Inherited Diseases
Even though mutation is a common occurrence, most inherited diseases are 
comfortingly rare. Inherited disorders are often recessive and show up only 
when an individual is homozygous for the trait. Inherited diseases aren’t non-
existent, though. The following sections provide details on three relatively 
common inherited diseases. You can find out more about inheritance pat-
terns in Chapter 12.
Cystic fibrosis
The most common inherited disorder among Caucasians in the United States 
is cystic fibrosis (CF). This autosomal recessive disorder occurs in roughly 
one in every 3,000 births (autosomal recessive means the gene isn’t on a sex 
chromosome and a person must have two copies of the allele to get the dis-
ease; see Chapter 3). The mutations (there can be many) that cause CF occur 
in a gene located on chromosome 7. Persons affected with CF produce thick, 
sticky mucus in their lungs, intestines, and pancreas.
 
The gene implicated in CF, called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance 
regulator gene (or CFTR for short), normally controls the passage of salt across 
cell membranes. Water naturally moves to areas where salt is more concen-
trated, so the movement of salt from one place to another has an effect on how 
much water is present in parts of the body. In persons with CF, the removal of 
salt from the body (via sweat) is abnormally high. As a result, the lungs, pan-
creas, and digestive system can’t retain enough water to dilute the mucus nor-
mally found in those systems, so the buildup of thick mucus blocks breathing 
passages and makes waste elimination difficult, causing severe breathing and 
digestive difficulties and a high susceptibility to respiratory illnesses.
CF is diagnosed in two ways:
 
✓ Persons who may be carriers for the mutated allele can undergo genetic 
testing.
 
✓ Children possibly affected by the disease are diagnosed by a “sweat 
test.” Their sweat is tested for salt content, and abnormally high 
amounts of salt indicate that the child has the disease.
CF is a target of gene therapy (see Chapter 16), but it resists a cure. Most 
afflicted persons must endure a lifetime of treatment that includes having 
someone pound on their chests so that they can remove the mucus from 
their lungs by coughing. The prognosis for CF has improved dramatically, yet 
most persons affected by the disease don’t live far beyond their 30s.

fibrosis.ca).
Sickle cell anemia
Sickle cell anemia is the most common genetic disorder among African 
Americans in the United States — roughly one in every 400 births is affected 
by this autosomal recessive disorder. The mutation responsible for sickle cell 
is found on chromosome 11, the gene responsible for making one part of the 
protein complex that composes hemoglobin (check out Chapter 9 for how 
complex proteins are formed). In the case of sickle cell, one base is mutated 
from adenine to thymine (a transversion). The mistake changes one amino 
acid added during translation from glutamic acid to valine, producing a pro-
tein that folds improperly and can’t carry oxygen effectively.
The red blood cells of persons affected by sickle cell take on the disease’s 
characteristic crescent shape when oxygen levels in the body are lower than 
usual (often as the result of aerobic exercise). The sickling event has the side 
effect of causing blood clots to form in the smaller blood vessels (capillaries) 
throughout the body. Clot formation is extremely painful and also causes 
damage to tissues that are sensitive to oxygen deprivation. Persons with 
sickle cell are vulnerable to kidney failure, yet with good medical care, most 
affected persons live into middle adulthood (40 to 50 years of age).
 
For more information on sickle cell anemia, contact the American Sickle Cell 
Anemia Association at 216-229-8600 (www.ascaa.org).
Tay-Sachs disease
An autosomal recessive disorder, Tay-Sachs disease is a progressive, fatal 
disease of the nervous system and is unusually common among persons of 
Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish ancestry. One in every 30 to 40 per-
sons of Jewish ancestry is a carrier of Tay-Sachs disease. French Canadians 
and persons of Cajun (south Louisiana) descent are also often carriers of the 
mutated allele.
The mutation that causes Tay-Sachs disease is found in the gene that codes 
for the enzyme hexosaminidase A (HEXA). Normally, your body breaks 
down a class of fats called gangliosides. When HEXA is mutated, the normal 
metabolism of gangliosides stops and the fats build up in the brain, causing 
damage. Children inheriting two copies of the affected allele are normal at 

201
 Chapter 13: Mutation and Inherited Diseases: Things You Can’t Change
birth, but as the fats build up in their brain over time, these children become 
blind, deaf, mentally impaired, and ultimately paralyzed. Most children with 
Tay-Sachs disease don’t survive beyond the age of 4. Unlike some metabolic 
disorders, such as phenylketonuria (see Chapter 12), changes in diet don’t 
prevent the buildup of the unwanted chemical in the body.

Allied Diseases Association at 800-906-8723 (www.ntsad.org).

Genetics of Cancer
In This Chapter

▶ Understanding the genetic basis of cancer
▶ Looking at the different types of cancer
I
f you’ve had personal experience with cancer, you’re not alone. I’ve 
lost family members, co-workers, students, and friends to this insidious 
disease — it’s highly likely that you have, too. Second only to heart disease, 
cancer causes the deaths of around 560,000 persons a year in the United 
States alone, and it was estimated that nearly 1.5 million Americans would 
be diagnosed with cancer in 2009. Cancer is a genetic disorder that involves 
how cells grow and divide. Your likelihood of getting cancer is influenced 
by your genes (the genes you inherited from your parents) and your expo-
sure to certain chemicals and radiation. Sometimes, cancers occur from 
random, spontaneous mutations — events that defy explanation and have 
no apparent cause. In this chapter, you find out what cancer is, the genetic 
basis of cancers, and some details about the most common types of cancer.
 
If you skipped over Chapter 2 on cells, you may want to backtrack before delv-
ing into this chapter, because cell information helps you understand what you 
read here. All cancers arise from mutations; you can discover how and why 
mutations occur in Chapter 13. I cover cancer treatments in the form of gene 
therapy in Chapter 16.
Defining Cancer
Cancer is, in essence, cell division running out of control. As I explain in 
Chapter 2, the cell cycle is normally a carefully regulated process. Cells grow 
and divide on a schedule that’s determined by the type of cell involved. Skin 
cells grow and divide continuously because replacing dead skin cells is a 

204
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
never-ending job. Some cells retire from the cell cycle: The cells in your brain 
and nervous system don’t take part in the cell cycle; no growth and no cell 
division occur there during adulthood. Cancer cells, on the other hand, don’t 
obey the rules and have their own, often frightening, agendas and schedules. 
Table 14-1 lists the probability of developing one of the six most common 
cancers in the U.S.

In the following sections, I outline the two basic categories of tumors — 
benign and malignant. Benign tumors grow out of control but don’t invade sur-
rounding tissues. Malignant tumors are invasive and have a disturbing 
tendency to travel and show up in new sites around the body.
Benign growths: Nearly harmless growths
In a benign tumor, the cells divide at an abnormally high rate but remain in 
the same location. Benign tumors tend to grow rather slowly, and they create 
trouble because of tumor formation. In general, a tumor is any mass of abnor-
mal cells. Tumors cause problems because they take up space and can com-
press nearby organs. For example, a tumor that grows near a blood vessel 
can eventually cut off blood flow just by virtue of its bulk. Benign growths 
can sometimes also interfere with normal body function and even affect 
genes by altering hormone production (see Chapter 10 for how hormones 
control genes).
Generally, benign growths are characterized by their lack of invasiveness. A 
benign tumor is usually well-defined from surrounding tissue, pushes other 
tissues aside, and can be easily moved about. The cells of benign tumors usu-
ally bear a strong resemblance to the tissues they start from. For example, 
under a microscope, a cell from a benign skin tumor looks similar to a normal 
skin cell.

205
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
A different sort of benign cell growth is called a dysplasia, a cell with an abnor-
mal appearance. Dysplasias aren’t cancerous (that is, they don’t divide out 
of control) but are worrisome because they have the potential to go through 
changes that lead to malignant cancers. When examined under the micro-
scope, dysplasias often have enlarged cell nuclei and a “disorderly” appear-
ance. In other words, they have irregular shapes and sizes relative to other 
cells of the same type. Tumor cells sometimes start as one cell type (benign) 
but, if left untreated, can give rise to more invasive types as time goes on.
Treatment of benign growths (including dysplasias) varies widely depending 
on the size of the tumor, its potential for growth, the location of the growth, 
and the probability that cell change may lead to malignancy (invasive forms 
of cancer; see the following section). Some benign growths shrink and disap-
pear on their own, and others require surgical removal.
 
The best defense against benign tumors (and any sort of cancer) is early 
detection.
 
✓ Men should undergo yearly prostate checkups beginning at age 50.
 
✓ All women over age 20 should do breast self-exams every month.
 
✓ All women should get yearly mammograms starting at age 40.
 
✓ Women should have a Pap smear, a test to assess the cells of their 
cervix, every one to three years depending on their age and the results 
of their previous exams.
Malignancies: Seriously scary results
Probably one of the most frightening words a doctor can utter is “malignant.” 
Malignancy is characterized by cancer cells’ rapid growth, invasion into 
neighboring tissues, and the tendency to metastasize. Metastasis occurs when 
cancer cells begin to grow in other parts of the body besides the original tumor 
site; cancers tend to metastasize to the bones, liver, lungs, and brain. Like 
benign growths, malignancies form tumors, but malignant tumors are poorly 
defined from the surrounding tissue — in other words, it’s difficult to tell 
where the tumor ends and normal tissue begins. (See the section “Metastasis: 
Cancer on the move” later in this chapter for more info on the process.)
Malignant cells tend to look very different from the cells they arise from 
(Figure 14-1 shows the differences). The cells of malignant tumors often look 
more like tissues from embryos or stem cells than normal “mature” cells. 
Malignant cells tend to have large nuclei, and the cells themselves are usually 
larger than normal. The more abnormal the cells appear, the more likely it is 
that the tumor may be invasive and able to metastasize.

Malignancies fall into one of five categories based on the tissue type they 
arise from:
 
✓ Carcinomas are associated with skin, nervous system, gut, and respira-
tory tract tissue.
 
✓ Sarcomas are associated with connective tissue (such as muscle) and 
bone.
 
✓ Leukemias (related to sarcomas) are cancers of the blood.
 
✓ Lymphomas develop in glands that fight infection (lymph nodes and 
glands scattered throughout the body).
 
✓ Myelomas start in the bone marrow.
Cancer can occur in essentially any cell of the body. The human body has 300 
or so different cell types, and doctors have identified 200 forms of cancer.
Treatment of malignancy varies depending on the location of the tumor, the 
degree of invasion, the potential for metastasis, and a host of other factors. 
Treatment may include surgical removal of the tumor, surrounding tissues, 
and lymph nodes (little knots of immune tissue found in scattered locations 
around the body). Chemotherapy (administering of anticancer drugs) and 
radiation may also be used to combat the growth of invasive cancers. Some 
forms of gene therapy, which I address in Chapter 16, may also prove helpful.
Metastasis: Cancer on the move
Cells in your body stay in their normal places because of physical barriers to 
cell growth. One such barrier is called the basal lamina. The basal lamina (or 
basement membrane) is a thin sheet of proteins that’s sandwiched between 
layers of cells. Metastatic cells produce enzymes that destroy the basal 

207
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
lamina and other barriers between cell types. Essentially, metastatic cells 
eat their way out by literally digesting the membranes designed to keep cells 
from invading each other’s space. Sometimes, these invasions allow meta-
static cells to enter the bloodstream, which transports the cells to new sites 
where they can set up shop to begin a new cycle of growth and invasion.
Another consequence of breaking down the basal lamina is that the action 
allows tumors to set up their own blood supply in a process called angiogen-
esis. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels to supply the tumor 
cells with oxygen and nutrients. Tumors may even secrete their own growth 
factors to encourage the process of angiogenesis. Oddly, primary tumors 
(the first site of tumor growth in the body) seem to restrain angiogenesis 
in metastasized tissue. When the primary tumor is removed, this control is 
released, and angiogenesis in the metastasized tumors speeds up. Increased 
angiogenesis means that the metastasized tumors may start to grow more 
rapidly, launching a new round of treatment.
 
A study of breast cancer in 2003 showed that cells that plant the seeds for 
metastasis depart the original tumor sites without the mutations that are 
thought to create metastasis in the first place. The wandering cells acquire 
mutations later, after they’ve settled in new locations. This discovery means 
that the old view (still found in many textbooks) of how metastasis develops — 
a stepwise, one mutation at a time process that happens in the primary tumor 
cells — is probably wrong.
Recognizing Cancer as a DNA Disease
Normally, a host of genes regulate the cell cycle. Thus, at its root, cancer is 
a disease of the DNA. Mutation damages DNA, and mutations can ultimately 
take the phenotype (physical trait) of cancer. The good news is it takes more 
than one mutation to give a cell the potential to become cancerous. The trans-
formation from normal cell to cancer cell is thought to require certain genetic 
changes. These mutations can happen in any order — it’s not a 1-2-3 process.
 
✓ A mutation occurs that starts cells on an abnormally high rate of cell 
division.
 
✓ A mutation in one (or more) rapidly dividing cells confers the ability to 
invade surrounding tissue.
 
✓ Additional mutations accumulate to confer more invasive properties or 
the ability to metastasize.
 
Most cancers arise from two or more mutations that occur in the DNA of one 
cell. Tumors result from many cell divisions. The original cell containing the 
mutations divides, and that cell’s “offspring” divide over and over to form a 
tumor (see Figure 14-2).

Exploring the cell cycle and cancer
The cell cycle and division (called mitosis, which I cover in Chapter 2) is 
tightly regulated in normal cells. Cells must pass through checkpoints, or 
stages of the cell cycle, in order to proceed to the next stage. If DNA synthe-
sis isn’t complete or damage to the DNA hasn’t been repaired, the check-
points prevent the cell from moving into another stage of division. These 
checkpoints protect the integrity of the cell and the DNA inside it. Figure 14-3 
shows the cell cycle and the checkpoints that occur throughout.
 
Chapter 2 explains two checkpoints of the cell cycle. Four major conditions — 
basically, quality control points — must be met for cells to divide:
 
✓ DNA must be undamaged (no mismatches, bulges, or strand breaks like 
those described in Chapter 13) for the cell to pass from G1 of interphase 
into S (DNA synthesis).
 
✓ All the chromosomes must complete replication for the cell to pass out 
of S.
 
✓ DNA must be undamaged to start prophase of mitosis.
 
✓ Spindles required to separate chromosomes must form properly for 
mitosis to be completed.
If any of these conditions aren’t met, the cell is “arrested” and not allowed to 
continue to the next phase of division. Many genes and the proteins they pro-
duce are responsible for making sure that cells meet all the necessary condi-
tions for cell division.
When it comes to cancer and how things go wrong with the cell cycle, two 
types of genes are especially important:

209
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
 
✓ Proto-oncogenes, which stimulate the cell to grow and divide, basically 
acting to push the cell through the checkpoints
 
✓ Tumor-suppressor genes, which act to stop cell growth and tell cells 
when their normal life spans have ended

Basically, two things go on in the cell: One set of genes (and their products) 
acts like an accelerator to tell cells to grow and divide, and a second set of 
genes puts on the brakes, telling cells when to stop growing, when not to 
divide, and even when to die.
 
The mutations that cause cancer turn proto-oncogenes into either oncogenes 
(turning the accelerator permanently “on”) or damage tumor-suppressor 
genes (removing the brakes).
Genes gone wrong: Oncogenes
You can think of oncogenes as “on” genes because that’s essentially what 
these genes do: They keep cell division turned on. Many genes, when mutated, 
can become oncogenes. All oncogenes have several things in common:
 
✓ Their mutations usually represent a gain of function (see Chapter 13).
 
✓ They’re dominant in their actions.
 
✓ Their effects cause excessive numbers of cells to be produced.
 
Oncogenes were the first genes identified to play a role in cancer. In 1910, 
Peyton Rous identified a virus that caused cancer in chickens. It took 60 years 
for scientists to identify the gene carried by the virus, the first known onco-
gene. It turns out that many viruses can cause cancer in animals and humans; 
for more on how these viruses do their dirty work, see the sidebar “Exploring 
the link between viruses and cancer.”

210
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Exploring the link between viruses and cancer
It’s becoming clearer that viruses play a sig-
nificant role in the appearance of cancer in 
humans. Second only to the risk factor of ciga-
rette smoking, viruses are responsible for at 
least 15 percent of all malignancies. It turns out 
that viruses may alter how epigenetics controls 
when genes are turned on and off (you can find 
out more about epigenetics in Chapter 4), allow-
ing cells to grow out of control.
One class of viruses implicated in cancer 
is retroviruses. One familiar retrovirus that 
makes significant assaults on human health is 
HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), which 
causes AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency 
Syndrome). And if you have a cat, you may 
be familiar with feline leukemia, which is also 
caused by a retrovirus (humans are immune 
to this cat virus). Most retroviruses use RNA 
as their genetic material. Viruses aren’t really 
alive, so to replicate their genes, they have to 
hijack a living cell. Retroviruses use the host 
cell’s machinery to synthesize DNA copies of 
their RNA chromosomes. The viral DNA then 
gets inserted into the host cell’s chromosome 
where the virus genes can be active and wreak 
havoc with the cell and, in turn, the entire 
organism. Retroviruses that cause cancer copy 
their oncogenes into the host cell. The onco-
genes team up with additional mutations to 
cause cancer.
If you’ve ever had a wart, then you’re already 
acquainted with the harmless version of a virus 
whose relatives can cause cancer. Human pap-
illoma virus (HPV) causes genital warts and is 
linked to cervical cancer in women. Infection 
with the HPV associated with cervical cancer 
usually starts with dysplasia (the formation 
of abnormal but noncancerous cells). It usu-
ally takes many years for cervical cancer to 
develop, which it does only rarely. Nevertheless, 
it was expected that roughly 11,000 women in 
the United States alone would be diagnosed 
with cervical cancer in 2009. Early screening, 
in the form of Pap smears, for cervical cancer 
has improved detection and saved the lives of 
countless women. In 2009, reports surfaced that 
prostate cancer may be linked with a retrovirus 
(called XMRV) that is associated with cervical 
cancer, suggesting the possibility that some 
forms of prostate cancer may be caused by a 
sexually transmitted virus. A 2009 study pub-
lished in the British Journal of Cancer indicates 
that HPV may also be associated with breast 
cancer — this is somewhat good news, how-
ever, since a vaccine has already been devel-
oped to ward off the virus.
Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) has long 
been known to cause breast cancer in mice. 
Recent research shows that humans may also 
be vulnerable to MMTV. Certain kinds of breast 
cancers are more common in regions (such as 
the Middle East and Northern Africa) where 
a particular species of mouse (House Mouse, 
Mus domesticus) that carries MMTV is also 
common. These cancers tend to be very inva-
sive and aggressive and are often accompa-
nied by swelling and infection-like symptoms. 
Researchers examined breast tissue from 
affected women for the presence of genes 
similar to those of the virus. They found that 
North African women often carried a MMTV-
like gene; many women from this region also 
showed other signs of having been infected 
with the virus. Although the link between the 
virus MMTV and human breast cancer is still 
uncertain, this and other research suggests 
that viruses may play significant roles in many 
human cancers.

211
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
You have at least 70 naturally occurring proto-oncogenes in your DNA. 
Normally, these genes carry out regulatory jobs necessary for normal func-
tioning. It’s only when these genes gain mutations and become oncogenes 
that they switch from good genes to cancer-causers. Cancer cells tend to 
have multiple copies of oncogenes because the genes somehow duplicate 
themselves in a process called amplification. This duplication allows those 
genes to have much stronger effects than they normally would.
 
A group of geneticists think they’ve figured out how cancer genes go about 
copying themselves. The first step in the process is formation of a palindrome — 
a DNA sequence that reads the same way forwards and backwards. In this case, 
the palindrome is created when a sequence gets clipped out of the DNA, flipped 
around, duplicated, and then inserted into the DNA (it’s called an inverted 
repeat). The DNA of tumor cells has unusual numbers of palindromes. 
Palindromes seem to encourage more cut-and-paste duplications in the DNA 
around them, leading to amplification of nearby genes, like oncogenes.
 
The first oncogene identified in humans resides on chromosome 11. The scien-
tists responsible for its discovery were looking for the gene responsible for 
bladder cancer. They took cancerous cells and isolated their DNA; then they 
introduced small parts of the cancer cell’s DNA into a bacteria and allowed the 
bacteria to infect normal cells growing in test tubes. The scientists were look-
ing for the part of the DNA present in cancer cells that would transform the 
normal cells into cancerous ones. The gene they found, now called HRAS1, 
was very similar to a virus oncogene that had been found in rats. The muta-
tion that makes HRAS1 into an oncogene affects only three bases of the 
genetic code (called a codon; see Chapter 9). This tiny change causes HRAS1 
to constantly send the signal “divide” to affected cells.
Since the discovery of HRAS1, a whole group of oncogenes has been found; 
they’re known collectively as the RAS genes. All the RAS genes work much 
the same way and, when mutated, turn the cell cycle permanently “on.” In 
spite of their dominant activities, a single mutated oncogene usually isn’t 
enough to cause cancer all by itself. That’s because tumor-suppressor genes 
(see the next section) are still acting to put on the brakes and keep cell 
growth from getting out of control.
Oncogenes aren’t usually implicated in inherited forms of cancer. Most onco-
genes show up as somatic mutations that can’t be passed on from parent to 
child.
The good guys: Tumor-suppressor genes
Tumor-suppressor genes are the cell cycle’s brakes. Normally, these genes 
work to slow or stop cell growth and to put a halt to the cell cycle. When 
these genes fail, cells can divide out of control, meaning that mutations in 

212
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
tumor-suppressor genes are loss-of-function mutations (covered in Chapter 
13). Loss-of-function mutations generally only show up as phenotype when 
two bad copies are present — therefore, the loss of tumor-suppression 
means that two events have occurred to make the cells homozygous for the 
mutation.
 
The first gene recognized as a tumor suppressor is associated with cancer of 
the eye, called retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma often runs in families and 
shows up in very young children. In 1971, geneticist Alfred Knudson suggested 
that one mutated allele of the gene was being passed from parent to child and 
that a mutation event in the child was required for the cancer to occur. The 
gene responsible, called RB1, was mapped to chromosome 13 and is impli-
cated in other forms of cancer such as breast, prostate, and bone (osteosar-
coma). RB1 turns out to be a very important gene. If both copies are mutated 
in embryos, the mutations are lethal, suggesting that normal RB1 function is 
required for survival.
RB1 regulates the cell cycle by interacting with transcription factors (I dis-
cuss transcription factors in greater detail in Chapters 9 and 11). These 
particular transcription factors control the expression of genes that push 
the cell through the checkpoint at the end of G1, just before DNA synthesis. 
When the proteins that RB1 codes for (called pRB) are attached to the tran-
scription factors, the genes that turn on the cell cycle aren’t allowed to func-
tion. Normally, pRB and the transcription factors go through periods of being 
attached and coming apart, turning the cell cycle on and off. If both copies of 
RB1 are mutated, then this important brake system goes missing. As a result, 
affected cells move through the cell cycle faster than normal and divide with-
out stopping. RB1 not only interacts with transcription factors to control the 
cell cycle; it’s also thought to play a role in replication, DNA repair, and apop-
tosis (programmed cell death).
One of the most important tumor-suppressor genes identified to date is TP53, 
found on chromosome 17, which codes for the cell-cycle regulating protein 
p53. Mutations that lead to loss of p53 function are implicated in a wide vari-
ety of cancers. The most important of p53’s roles may be in regulating when 
cells die, a process known as apoptosis:
 
✓ When DNA has been damaged, the cell cycle is stopped to allow repairs 
to be carried out.
 
✓ If repair isn’t possible, the cell receives the signal to die (apoptosis).
If you’ve ever had a bad sunburn, then you have firsthand experience with 
apoptosis. Apoptosis, also known by the gloomy moniker “programmed cell 
death,” occurs when the DNA of a cell is too damaged to be repaired. Rather 
than allow the damage to go through replication and become cemented into 
the DNA as mutation, the cell voluntarily dies. In the case of your severe 
sunburn, the DNA of the exposed skin cells was damaged by the sun’s radia-
tion. In many cases, the DNA strands were broken, probably in many different 

213
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
places. Those skin cells killed themselves off, resulting in the unpleasant skin 
peeling that you suffered. When your DNA gets damaged from too much sun 
exposure or because of any other mutagen (see Chapter 13 for examples), 
a protein called p21 stops the cell cycle. Encoded by a gene on the X chro-
mosome, p21 is produced when the cell is stressed. The presence of p21 
stops the cell from dividing and allows repair mechanisms to heal the dam-
aged DNA. If the damage is beyond repair, the cell may skip p21 altogether. 
Instead, the tumor-suppressor protein p53 signals the cell to kill itself.
 
When the cell gets the message that says, “Die!” a gene called BAX 
swings into action. BAX sends the cell off to its destruction by signaling the 
mitochondria — those energy powerhouses of the cell — which release a 
wrecking-crew of proteins that go about breaking up the chromosomes and 
killing the cell from the inside. When your cells die due to injury (like a burn 
or infection), the process is a messy one: The cells explode, causing sur-
rounding cells to react in the form of inflammation. Not so in apoptosis. The 
cells killed by the actions of apoptosis are neatly packaged so that sur-
rounding tissues don’t react. Cells that specialize in garbage collection and 
disposal, called phagocytes (meaning cells that eat), do the rest.
Drugs used to fight cancer often try to take advantage of the apoptosis path-
way to cell death. The drugs turn on the signals for apoptosis to trick the 
cancer cells into killing themselves. Radiation therapy, also used to treat 
cancer by introducing double-strand breaks (see Chapter 13 for more on this 
kind of DNA damage), relies on the cells knowing when to die. Unfortunately, 
some of the mutations that create cancer in the first place make cancer cells 
resistant to apoptosis. In other words, in addition to growing and dividing 
without restriction, cancer cells don’t know when to die.
Demystifying chromosome abnormalities
Large-scale chromosome changes — the kinds that are visible when karyo-
typing (chromosome examination; see Chapter 15 for details) is done — are 
associated with some cancers. These chromosome changes (like losses of 
chromosomes) often occur after cancer develops and occur because the DNA 
in cancer cells is really unstable and prone to lots of breakage. Normally, 
damaged DNA is detected by proteins that keep tabs on the cell cycle. When 
breaks are found, either the cell cycle is stopped and repairs are initiated or 
the cell dies. Because the root of cancer is the loss of genetic quality control 
functions provided by proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes, it’s 
no surprise that breaks in the cancer-cell DNA lead to losses and rearrange-
ments of big chunks of chromosomes as the cell cycle rolls on without inter-
ruption. One of the biggest problems with all this genetic instability in cancer 
cells is that a tumor is likely to have several different genotypes among its 
many cells, which makes treatment difficult. Chemotherapy that’s effective at 
treating cells with one sort of mutation may not be useful for another.

214
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Three types of damage — deletions, inversions, and translocations — 
can interrupt tumor-suppressor genes, rendering them nonfunctional. 
Translocations and inversions may change the positions of certain genes so 
that the gene gets regulated in a new way (see Chapter 11 for more about 
how gene expression is regulated by location). Chronic myeloid leukemia, for 
example, is caused by a translocation event between chromosomes 9 and 22. 
This form of leukemia is a cancer of the blood that affects the bone marrow.
 
Translocations generally result from double-strand breaks (radiation and ciga-
rette smoking are risk factors). In the case of chronic myeloid leukemia, the 
translocation event makes chromosome 22 unusually short. (This shortened 
version of the chromosome is called the Philadelphia chromosome because 
geneticists working in that city discovered it.) The translocation event causes 
two genes, one from each chromosome, to become fused together. The new 
gene product acts as a powerful oncogene, leading to out-of-control cell divi-
sion and eventually leukemia.
Certain cancers seem prone to losing particular chromosomes altogether, 
resulting in monosomies (similar to those described in Chapter 15). For 
instance, one copy of chromosome 10 often goes missing in the cells of 
glioblastomas, a deadly form of brain cancer. Cancer cells are also prone to 
nondisjunction leading to localized trisomies. It appears that mutations in the 
p53 gene, which can stop the cell cycle for DNA repair and signal apoptosis, 
are linked to these localized changes in chromosome number.
Breaking Down the Types of Cancers
Around 200 different cancers occur in humans. Many are site specific, mean-
ing the tumor is associated with a particular part of the body. Some cancers 
seem to appear just about anywhere, in any organ system. This section isn’t 
meant to provide an exhaustive list of cancers; instead, it touches on the 
genetics of some of the more common cancers.
 
For more information on all types of cancers, visit the American Cancer 
Society (www.cancer.org) and the National Cancer Institute (www.cancer.
gov) online.
Hereditary cancers
 
Hereditary cancers are those that tend to run in families. No one ever inherits 
cancer; what’s inherited is the predisposition to certain sorts of cancer. What 
this means is that certain cancers tend to run in families because one or more 
mutations are being passed on from parent to child. Most geneticists agree 
that additional mutations are required to trigger the actual disease. Just 

215
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
because you have a family history of a particular cancer doesn’t mean you’ll 
get it. The opposite is also true: Just because you don’t have a family history 
doesn’t mean you won’t get cancer.
Prostate cancer
The most common cancer in the United States is prostate cancer. The pros-
tate is a walnut-sized gland found at the base of a man’s urinary bladder. 
The urethra, the tube that carries urine outside the body, runs through the 
center of the prostate gland. The prostate generates seminal fluid, important 
for the production of sperm. On average, over 200,000 men are likely to be 
diagnosed with prostate cancer each year. The highest rates of death from 
prostate cancer occur among African American men, likely because of lack of 
screening and delayed treatment.
Many mutations are associated with a family history of prostate cancer, but 
the number one risk factor associated with prostate cancer is age. Older men 
are far more likely to develop this disease.
For most men, the first clue of changes in the prostate gland is difficulty in 
urination and decreased urine flow. Many older men experience swelling of 
the prostate, and those changes are often benign. The best screening tests 
for prostate cancer are a blood test called the PSA (for prostate-specific 
antigen) and a manual examination by a physician. Men should start get-
ting screened for prostate cancer at age 50. Men with a family history of the 
disease (father, brother, or son) should start earlier — the American Cancer 
Society suggests that screening begin at age 45.
Numerous genes are implicated in prostate cancer. One gene, PRCA1 on chro-
mosome 1, is designated “the” hereditary prostate cancer gene. But less than 
10 percent of all cases of prostate cancers are thought to originate with muta-
tions at PRCA1. Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (see Chapter 24) lists at 
least 16 genes associated with prostate cancer, including p53 and RB; it’s likely 
that several genes interact to cause the cell cycle of the prostate gland to spiral 
out of control. There also seems to be a link between prostate cancer and 
the two BRCA genes implicated in breast cancer. Thus, men and women with 
family histories of either disease may be susceptible to developing cancer. New 
evidence points to a viral cause as well — see the earlier sidebar “Exploring 
the link between viruses and cancer” in this chapter to find out more.
Breast cancer
Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in America (refer to Table 
14-1). Sadly, over 40,000 people, mostly women, are likely to die of the dis-
ease each year. Different sorts of breast cancer are distinguished by the 
part of the breast that develops the tumor. Regardless of the type of breast 
cancer, though, the number one risk factor appears to be a family history of 
the disease. Family history of breast cancer is usually defined as having one 
of the following:

216
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
 
✓ A mother or sister diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer before age 50
 
✓ Two first-degree relatives (mother, sister, daughter) on the same side of 
the family with breast cancer at any age
 
✓ A male relative diagnosed with breast cancer
Generally, the first symptom of breast cancer is a lump in the breast tissue. 
The lump may be painless or sore, hard (like a firm knot) or soft; the edges 
of the lump may not be easy to detect, but in some cases they’re very easy 
to feel. Other symptoms include swelling, changes in the skin of the breast, 
nipple pain or unexpected discharge, and a swelling in the armpit.
Researchers have identified two breast cancer genes: BRCA1 and BRCA2 (for 
BReast CAncer genes 1 and 2). These genes account for slightly less than 25 
percent of inherited breast cancers, however. Mutations in the gene for p53, 
along with numerous other genes, are also associated with hereditary forms 
of breast cancer (see “The good guys: Tumor-suppressor genes” for more on 
p53). Breast cancers associated with mutations of BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 seem 
to be inherited as autosomal dominant disorders (genetic disorders resulting 
from one bad copy of a gene; see Chapter 12 for more on inheritance patterns).
When it comes to breast cancer, penetrance is roughly 50 percent, meaning 
50 percent of the people inheriting a mutation in one of the breast cancer 
genes will develop cancer. (This penetrance value is based on a life span of 
85 years, by the way, so people living 85 years have a 50 percent chance of 
expressing the phenotype of cancer.)
Other cancers are also associated with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2, 
including ovarian, prostate, and male breast cancer.
 
Both BRCA genes are tumor-suppressor genes. The roles these genes play in 
the cell cycle aren’t especially well defined. BRCA1 has a role in regulating 
when cells pass through the critical G1-S checkpoint, but exactly how BRCA1 
does its job isn’t clear. As for BRCA2, it apparently has some cell cycle duties 
and also plays a role in DNA repair, especially of double-strand breaks.
 
Early detection of breast cancer is the best defense against the disease. 
Women with a family history of breast cancer should be screened by a physi-
cian at least once a year (some doctors recommend screenings every six 
months). Genetic tests are available to confirm the presence of mutations that 
are associated with the development of breast cancer, but at present, these 
tests are very expensive and don’t yield complete information about the true 
likelihood of getting the disease. After breast cancer is diagnosed, treatment 
options vary based on the kind of cancer. Breast cancer is considered very 
treatable, and the prognosis for recovery is very good for most patients. There 
are hopes for a vaccine to prevent some forms breast cancer altogether; see 
the “Exploring the link between viruses and cancer” sidebar earlier in this 
chapter.

217
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
Colon cancer
One hereditary cancer that’s considered highly treatable (when detected 
early) is colon cancer. Your colon is defined by the large intestine, the bulky 
tube that carries waste products to your rectum for defecation. Over 100,000 
people are likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer each year. Numerous risk 
factors are associated with colon cancer, including:
 
✓ Family history of the disease (meaning parent, child, or sibling)
 
✓ Age; persons over 50 are at greater risk
 
✓ High-fat diet
 
✓ Obesity
 
✓ History of alcohol abuse
 
✓ Smoking
Almost all colon cancers start as benign growths called polyps. These polyps 
are tiny wart-like protrusions on the wall of the colon. If colon polyps are left 
untreated, a RAS oncogene often becomes active in the cells of one or more of 
the polyps, causing the affected polyps to increase in size (see the “Genes gone 
wrong: Oncogenes” section earlier in the chapter for more on how oncogenes 
work). When the tumors get big enough, they change status and are called ade-
nomas. Adenomas are benign tumors but are susceptible to mutation, often of 
the tumor-suppressor gene that controls p53. When p53 is lost through muta-
tion, the adenoma becomes a carcinoma — a malignant and invasive tumor.
Early detection and treatment is critical to prevent colon polyps from becom-
ing cancerous. If large numbers of polyps develop, the likelihood that at least 
one will become malignant is very high. The good news is that the changes 
in the colon usually accumulate slowly, over the course of several years. The 
American Cancer Society recommends that all persons over 50 years of age 
be screened for colon cancer. Two tests are generally done: a test to detect 
blood in the feces and a visual inspection, called a colonoscopy, of the inside 
of the colon using a flexible scope. The test kit to detect blood in the feces is 
available over the counter at most drug stores. Positive results are nothing 
to panic over — just see your physician. A colonoscopy is carried out under 
light anesthesia and gives your physician the most accurate means of diag-
nosing the presence of polyps and grabbing samples of cells for testing.
Preventable cancers
Preventable cancers are cancers associated with particular risk factors that 
can be controlled and avoided. No one ever chooses to get cancer, but the life-
style choices that people make leave them more likely to develop certain kinds 
of cancer in their lifetime. Three of the most avoidable kinds of cancer associ-
ated with lifestyle choices are lung cancer, mouth cancers, and skin cancer.

218
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Lung cancer
More people die from lung cancer every year than any other kind of cancer. 
Over 210,000 Americans are likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010, 
and it’s estimated that roughly 160,000 people in the United States will die 
from the disease in that year. Ninety percent of people who get lung cancer 
do so because of cigarette smoking. Let me repeat that: 90 percent of lung 
cancer is associated with cigarette smoking. This statistic makes lung cancer 
the most preventable cancer of all.
The average age for lung cancer diagnosis is age 60. Sadly, after a patient is 
diagnosed with lung cancer, the prognosis is generally poor. Survival esti-
mates vary depending on the type of lung cancer, but in general, only 20 per-
cent of people afflicted survive longer than one year after diagnosis. That’s 
the bad news. The good news is that if you stop smoking at any age, your 
lungs heal, and your risk of developing cancer goes down.
The two main types of lung cancer are both associated with tobacco use:
 
✓ Small-cell lung cancers, which comprise roughly 25 percent of all lung 
cancers, are the worst type. Named for the small, round cells that com-
prise these tumors, they’re invasive, highly prone to metastasis, and 
very hard to treat.
 
✓ Non-small-cell lung cancers are more amenable to treatment, especially 
when diagnosed early.
 
Both types of lung cancer have similar primary symptoms: weight loss, 
hoarseness, a cough that won’t go away, and difficulty breathing. Another 
symptom that’s often overlooked is finger clubbing. Finger clubbing is a condi-
tion in which the tips of the fingers get wider than normal. It’s a common sign 
of lung disease and an indication that small blood vessels aren’t getting 
enough oxygen.
Many mutations are associated with lung cancers. Both oncogenes and 
tumor-suppressor genes are implicated. Almost all lung cancers involve 
mutations of the p53 gene — the tumor-suppressor gene that controls, 
among other things, programmed cell death. A RAS oncogene, KRAS, is fre-
quently mutated in certain kinds of lung cancers. Finally, large-scale deletions 
of chromosomes, most often involving chromosome 3, are associated with 
virtually all small-cell lung cancers (see the section “Demystifying chromo-
some abnormalities” for more details).
Cancers of the mouth
The use of smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) is associated with 
cancers of the mouth. Roughly 7,000 persons each year die of preventable 
mouth cancers; men are twice as likely to get mouth cancer as women. Like 
lung cancer, the prognosis for persons diagnosed with mouth cancer is poor. 

219
 Chapter 14: Taking a Closer Look at the Genetics of Cancer
Only slightly more than 50 percent of persons survive beyond five years after 
diagnosis.
The reason the prognosis for mouth cancer is so poor is that early stages 
of the disease show no symptoms. Therefore, most people are unaware of 
the problem until the disease is more advanced. Symptoms of mouth cancer 
include sores on the gums, tongue, or the roof of the mouth that don’t heal; 
lumps in the mouth; thickening of the cheek lining; and persistent mouth 
pain. Regular dental care helps increase early detection, improving the 
chance of survival.
Mutations associated with mouth cancers are often large-scale chromosome 
abnormalities. Cells of the mouth appear especially vulnerable to mutational 
losses of parts of chromosomes 3, 9, and 11 — all of which are recognized 
fragile sites (see Chapter 15). Oncogenes in the RAS family and the p53 gene 
are also implicated in most forms of mouth cancer.
Skin cancer
Each year, nearly 60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with mela-
noma, a form of skin cancer. Although a predisposition to skin cancer may be 
inherited, the number one risk factor for skin cancer is exposure to ultravio-
let light. Ultraviolet light sources include the sun and tanning booths. People 
with pale skin, light-colored eyes (blue or green), and fair hair are most vul-
nerable to ultraviolet light and thus skin cancer. If you burn easily and don’t 
tan readily, you’re at higher risk. The best way to prevent skin cancer is to 
stay out of the sun. If you must be exposed to the sun, always use sunblock 
with an SPF (Sun Protection Factor) higher than 30.
Sunburn is strongly associated with the development of skin cancer at a 
later time because radiation tends to cause double-strand DNA breaks and 
also glues adjacent bases in the DNA together, forming spots called dimers 
(see Chapter 13 for more details on these sorts of DNA damage). Damage to 
DNA is often so great after severe sun exposure that large numbers of skin 
cells die. Take a look at the section on tumor-suppressor genes earlier in this 
chapter to find out about the process of “programmed cell death.” But some 
damaged DNA may escape the repair or cell death process, yielding danger-
ous mutations. Regular screening, the key to early detection of skin cancer, 
is as simple as inspecting your skin using a mirror. Look closely at all moles 
and freckles; asymmetrical, blotchy, or large (bigger than a pencil eraser) 
growths should be pointed out to your physician.

Chromosome Disorders: 
It’s All a Numbers Game
In This Chapter
▶ Examining chromosomes to figure out numbers and sets
▶ Understanding how things go wrong with chromosomes
T
he study of chromosomes is, in part, the study of cells. Geneticists who spe-
cialize in cytogenetics, the genetics of the cell, often examine chromosomes 
as the cell divides because that’s when the chromosomes are easiest to see. Cell 
division is one of the most important activities that cells undergo; it’s required 
for normal life, and a special sort of cell division prepares sex cells for the job of 
reproduction. Chromosomes are copied and divvied up during cell division, and 
getting the right number of chromosomes in each cell as it divides is critical. 
Most chromosome disorders (such as Down syndrome) occur because of mis-
takes during meiosis (the cell division that makes sex cells; see Chapter 2).
This chapter helps you understand how and why chromosome disorders 
occur. You find out some of the ways geneticists study the chromosome 
content of cells. Knowing chromosome numbers allows scientists to decode 
the mysteries of inheritance, especially when the number of chromosomes 
(called ploidy) gets complicated. Counting chromosomes also allows doctors 
to determine the origin of physical abnormalities caused by the presence of 
too many or too few chromosomes.
 
If you skipped over Chapter 2, you may want to flip back to it before reading 
this chapter to get a handle on the basics of chromosomes and how cells 
divide.
What Chromosomes Reveal
One way a geneticist counts chromosomes is with the aid of microscopes 
and special dyes to see the chromosomes during metaphase — the one time 
in the cell cycle when the chromosomes take on a fat, easy-to-see, sausage 

222
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
shape. (Jump to Chapter 2 to review the cell cycle.) Here’s how the process 
of examining chromosomes works:
 
1. A sample of cells is obtained. Almost any sort of dividing cell works as a 
sample, including root cells from plants, blood cells, or skin cells.
 
2. The cells are cultured — given the proper nutrients and conditions for 
growth — to stimulate cell division.
 
3. Some cells are removed from the culture and treated to stop mitosis 
during metaphase.
 
4. Dyes are added to make the chromosomes easy to see.
 
5. The cells are inspected under a microscope. The chromosomes are 
sorted, examined for obvious abnormalities, and counted.
This process of chromosome examination is called karyotyping. A karyotype 
reveals exactly how many chromosomes are present in a cell, along with 
some details about the chromosomes’ structure. Scientists can only see 
these details by staining the chromosomes with special dyes.
When examining a karyotype, a geneticist looks at each individual chromo-
some. Every chromosome has a typical size and shape; the location of the 
centromere and the length of the chromosome arms (the parts on either side 
of the centromere) are what define each chromosome’s physical appearance 
(refer to Chapter 2 to see what some chromosomes look like up close). The 
two types of chromosome arms are the
 
✓ p arm: The shorter of the two arms (from the word petite, French for 
“small”)
 
✓ q arm: The longer arm (because q follows p alphabetically)
In some disorders, one of the chromosome arms is misplaced or missing. 
Therefore, geneticists often refer to the chromosome number along with the 
letter p or q to communicate which part of the chromosome is affected.
Counting Up Chromosomes
Ploidy sounds like some bizarre, extraterrestrial, science-fiction creature, but 
the word actually refers to the number of chromosomes a particular organ-
ism has. Two sorts of “ploidys” are commonly bandied about in genetics:
 
✓ Aneuploid refers to an imbalance in the number of chromosomes. 
Situations involving aneuploidy are often given the suffix -somy to 
communicate whether chromosomes are missing (monosomy) or extra 
(trisomy).

223
 Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders: It’s All a Numbers Game
 
✓ Euploid refers to the number of sets of chromosomes an organism has. 
Thus, diploid tells you that the organism in question has two sets of 
chromosomes (often written as 2n, with n being the haploid number of 
chromosomes in the set; see Chapter 2 for more on how chromosomes 
are counted up). When an organism is euploid, its total number of chro-
mosomes is an exact multiple of its haploid number (n).
Aneuploidy: Extra or missing chromosomes
Shortly after Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that certain traits are linked 
to the X chromosome (see Chapter 5 for the full story), his student Calvin 
Bridges discovered that chromosomes don’t always play by the rules. The 
laws of Mendelian inheritance depend on the segregation of chromosomes — 
an event that takes place during the first phase of meiosis (see Chapter 2 
for meiosis coverage). But sometimes chromosomes don’t segregate; two 
or more copies of the same chromosome are sent to one gamete (sperm or 
egg), leaving another gamete without a copy of one chromosome. Through 
his study of fruit flies, Bridges discovered the phenomenon of nondisjunction, 
the failure of chromosomes to segregate properly. Figure 15-1 shows nondis-
junction at various stages of meiotic division. (For more on how Morgan and 
Bridges made their discoveries, check out the sidebar “Flies!”)
 
While studying eye color in flies (flip to Chapter 5 for more about this X-linked 
trait), Bridges crossed white-eyed female flies with red-eyed males. He 
expected to get all white-eyed sons and all red-eyed daughters from this sort 
of monohybrid cross (Chapter 3 explains monohybrid crosses). But every so 
often, he got red-eyed sons and white-eyed daughters. Bridges already knew 
that females get two copies of the X chromosome and males get only one, and 
that eye color is linked with X. He also knew that eye color is a recessive trait; 
the only way females could have white eyes is to have two copies of X that 
both have the allele for white. So how could the odd combinations of sex and 
eye color that Bridges saw occur?
Bridges realized that the X chromosomes of some of his female parent flies 
must not be obeying the rules of segregation. During the first round of meio-
sis, the homologous pairs of chromosomes should separate. If that doesn’t 
happen, some eggs get two copies of the mother’s X chromosome (see Figure 
15-1). In Bridges’s research, both copies of the mother’s X carried the allele 
for white eyes. When a red-eyed male fertilized a two-X egg, two results were 
possible, as you can see in Figure 15-2. An XXX zygote resulted in a red-eyed 
daughter (which usually died). An XXY zygote turned out to be a white-
eyed female (check out Chapter 5 for how sex is determined in fruit flies). 
Fertilized eggs that had no X chromosome resulted in a red-eyed male (with 
genotype X). Eggs that didn’t get an X chromosome and receive a Y from the 
father were never viable at all.

Many human chromosomal disorders arise from a sort of nondisjunction sim-
ilar to that of fruit flies. For more information on these disorders, take a look

Euploidy: Sets of chromosomes
Every species has a typical number of chromosomes revealed by its karyotype. 
For example, humans have 46 total chromosomes (humans are diploid, 2n, 
and n = 23). Your dog, if you have one, is also diploid and has 78 total chromo-
somes, while house cats have 2n = 38. Chromosome number isn’t very consis-
tent, even among closely related organisms. For example, despite their similar 
appearance, two species of Asian deer are both diploid but have very different 
chromosome numbers: One species has 23 chromosomes, and the other has 6.
Many organisms have more than two sets of chromosomes (a single set of 
chromosomes referred to by the n is the haploid number) and are therefore 
considered polyploid. Polyploidy is rare in animals but not unheard of. Plants, 
on the other hand, are frequently polyploid. The reason that polyploidy is 
rare is sexual reproduction. Most animals reproduce sexually, meaning each 
individual produces eggs or sperm that unite to form zygotes that grow into 
offspring. An equal number of chromosomes must be allotted to each gamete 
for fertilization and normal life processes to occur. When an individual, such 
as a plant, is polyploid (particularly odd numbers like 3n), most of its gam-
etes wind up with an unusual number of chromosomes. This imbalance in 
the number of chromosomes results, functionally, in sterility (see the sidebar 
“Stubborn chromosomes” for more details).
Flies!
Some of the greatest scientific discoveries have 
been made in the humblest of settings. Take 
Thomas Hunt Morgan’s laboratory, affection-
ately known as the Fly Room. A mere 368 square 
feet, it was crammed with eight students, their 
desks, hundreds of glass milk bottles full of fruit 
flies, and large bunches of bananas hung from 
the ceiling as food for the fruit flies. The room 
reeked of rotting bananas, literally buzzed with 
escapee flies, and had more than its fair share 
of cockroaches. Yet from 1910 to 1930, this 
cramped setting was home to some of the most 
important scientific discoveries of its time — 
discoveries that still apply to the understanding 
of genetics today.
Calvin Bridges and Alfred Sturtevant were 
both undergraduates at Columbia University in 
New York City in 1909. After hearing a lecture 
presented by Morgan, both Bridges and 
Sturtevant landed desk space in the Fly Room. 
Gregor Mendel’s work had only just been redis-
covered, so it was an exciting time for genet-
ics. Fruit flies made perfect study organisms to 
test all the latest ideas, so the men of the Fly 
Room (collaborator Nettie Stevens was at the 
Carnegie Institution) spent hours discussing 
the latest publications and their own research 
findings. After one such discussion, Sturtevant 
rushed home to work up his latest idea: a map 
of the genes on the X chromosome. Sturtevant 
created his chromosome map — still accurate 
to this day — when he was just 20 and still an 
undergraduate. Bridges, at the ripe old age of 
24, went on to discover nondisjunction of fly 
chromosomes — definitive proof that Morgan’s 
theory of chromosomal inheritance was correct.

Plants sometimes get around the problem of polyploidy (and its correspond-
ing sterility) through a process called apomixis. Part of meiosis, apomixis 
results in an egg with a full complement of chromosomes. Eggs produced via 
apomixis can form seeds without being fertilized and therefore can produce 
new plants from seed. Dandelions, those hardy, persistent weeds known to all 
gardeners, reproduce using apomixis. Dandelions have n = 8 chromosomes 
that can come in sets of two (2n = 16), three (3n = 24), or four (4n = 32).
Many commercial plants are polyploid because plant breeders discovered 
that polyploids often are much larger than their wild counterparts. Wild 
strawberries, for instance, are diploid, tiny, and very tart. The large, sweet 
strawberries you buy in the grocery store are actually octaploid, meaning 
they have eight sets of chromosomes (that is, they’re 8n). Cotton is tetra-
ploid (4n), and coffee can have as many as eight sets of chromosomes, while 
bananas are often triploid (3n). Many of these polyploids came about natu-
rally and, after being discovered by plant breeders, were cultivated from cut-
tings (and other nonsexual plant propagation methods).
Not all polyploids are sterile. Those that result from crosses of two different 
species (called hybridization) are often fertile. The chromosomes of hybrids 
may have less trouble sorting themselves out during meiosis, allowing for 
Stubborn chromosomes
Horses are diploid and have 64 chromosomes. 
Donkeys, which are also diploid, are closely 
related to horses but have only 62 chromo-
somes. When a horse mates with a donkey, the 
result is a mule. These horse-donkey hybrids 
are larger versions of horses and have big ears 
and a famously stubborn disposition. Mules are 
usually sterile because the ploidies of horses 
and mules (or of donkeys and mules) are a poor 
match. Genetically, mules have 32 horse chro-
mosomes and 31 donkey chromosomes, giving 
them a total of 63 chromosomes altogether 
and the odd chromosome number of 2n = 63 — 
that’s diploid but not euploid. When meiosis 
takes place, the homologous chromosomes 
should pair up and then segregate. During mei-
osis in mules, however, chromosomes often 
come together in groups of three, five, or six. As 
a result, mule gametes don’t get a full comple-
ment of chromosomes and aren’t viable to be 
fertilized. So how can any mule be a parent?
That’s what the owners of a mule named 
Krause must have wondered in 1984 when she 
unexpectedly produced a foal — named Blue 
Moon because of the rarity of mule parenthood. 
Krause cohabitated with a male donkey, but 
genetic analysis revealed that Blue Moon had 
a mule genotype: 63 chromosomes that were 
half horse and half donkey. Apparently, when 
Krause’s cells underwent meiosis, her horse 
chromosomes all segregated together. This 
is an outrageously improbable outcome — on 
the order of one in 4 billion! Even more amaz-
ingly, Krause had a second foal with the same 
horse-donkey genotype, meaning she produced 
a second egg with all horse chromosomes.
The only other way a mule can be a “parent” is 
via cloning, which I cover in Chapter 20. Idaho 
Gem, the first mule clone, was born in 2003.

227
 Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders: It’s All a Numbers Game
normal gamete formation to take place. One famous animal example of a 
rarely fertile hybrid is a horse-donkey cross that results in a mule. Take a 
look at the “Stubborn chromosomes” sidebar for more information.
Exploring Chromosome Variations
Chromosomal abnormalities, in the form of aneuploidy (see the earlier sec-
tion “Aneuploidy: Extra or missing chromosomes”), are very common among 
humans. Roughly 8 percent of all conceptions are aneuploid, and it’s esti-
mated that up to half of all miscarriages happen because of some form of 
chromosome disorder. Sex chromosome disorders are the most commonly 
observed type of aneuploidy in humans (flip to Chapter 5 for more on sex 
chromosomes) because X-chromosome inactivation allows individuals with 
more than two X chromosomes to compensate for the extra “doses” and sur-
vive the condition.
Four common categories of aneuploidy crop up in humans:
 
✓ Nullisomy: Occurs when a chromosome is missing altogether. Generally, 
embryos that are nullisomic don’t survive to be born.
 
✓ Monosomy: Occurs when one chromosome lacks its homolog.
 
✓ Trisomy: Occurs when one extra copy of a chromosome is present.
 
✓ Tetrasomy: Occurs when four total copies of a chromosome are present. 
Tetrasomy is extremely rare.
 
Most chromosome conditions are referred to by category of aneuploidy fol-
lowed by the number of the affected chromosome. For example, trisomy 13 
means that three copies of chromosome 13 are present.
When chromosomes go missing
Monosomy (when one chromosome lacks its homolog) in humans is very 
rare. The majority of embryos with monosomies don’t survive to be born. For 
liveborn infants, the only autosomal monosomy reported in humans is mono-
somy 21. Signs and symptoms of monosomy 21 are similar to those of Down 
syndrome (covered later in this section). Infants with monosomy 21 often 
have numerous birth defects and rarely survive for longer than a few days 
or weeks. The other monosomy commonly seen in children is monosomy of 
the X chromosome. Children with this condition are always female and usu-
ally lead normal lives. For more on monosomy X (also known as Turner syn-
drome), see Chapter 5. Monosomy 21 is the result of nondisjunction during 
meiosis (see the section “Aneuploidy: Extra or missing chromosomes” earlier 
in this chapter).

228
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Many monosomies are partial losses of chromosomes, meaning that part 
(or all) of the missing chromosome is attached to another chromosome. 
Movements of parts of chromosomes to other, nonhomologous chromo-
somes are the result of translocations. I cover translocations in more detail in 
the section “Translocations” later in this chapter.
Finally, monosomies can occur in cells because of mistakes that occur during 
cell division (mitosis). Many of these monosomies are associated with chemi-
cal exposure and various sorts of cancers. Chapter 14 covers cell monoso-
mies and cancer in detail.
When too many chromosomes are left in
 
Trisomies (when one extra copy of a chromosome is present) are the most 
common sorts of chromosomal abnormalities in humans. The most common 
trisomy is Down syndrome, or trisomy 21. Other, less common trisomies 
include trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), and 
trisomy 8. All these trisomies are usually the result of nondisjunction during 
meiosis.
Down syndrome
Trisomy of chromosome 21, commonly called Down syndrome, affects 
between 1 in 600 to 1 in 800 infants. People with Down syndrome have some 
rather stereotyped physical characteristics, including distinct facial features, 
altered body shape, and short stature. Individuals with Down syndrome usu-
ally have mental retardation and often have heart defects. Nevertheless, they 
often lead fulfilling and active lives well into adulthood.
One of the most striking features of Down syndrome (and trisomies in general) 
is the precipitous increase in the number of Down syndrome babies born to 
mothers over 35 (see Figure 15-3). Women between 18 and 25 have a very low 
risk of having a baby with trisomy 21 (roughly 1 in 2,000). The risk increases 
slightly but steadily for women between 25 and 35 (about 1 in 900 for women 
30 years old) and then jumps dramatically. By the time a woman is 40, the 
probability of having a child with Down syndrome is 1 in 100, and by the age of 
50, the probability of conceiving a Down syndrome child is 1 in 12. Why does 
the risk of Down syndrome increase in the children of older women?
The majority of Down syndrome cases seem to arise from nondisjunction 
during meiosis. The reason behind this failure of chromosomes to segregate 
normally in older women is unclear. In females, meiosis actually begins in the 
fetus (flip to Chapter 2 for a review of gametogenesis in humans). All devel-
oping eggs go through the first round of prophase, including recombination. 
Meiosis in future egg cells then stops in a stage called diplotene, the stage of 
crossing-over, where homologous chromosomes are hooked together and 

229
 Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders: It’s All a Numbers Game
are in the process of exchanging parts of their DNA. Meiosis doesn’t start 
back up again until a particular developing egg is going through the process 
of ovulation. At that point, the egg completes the first round of meiosis and 
then halts again. When sperm and egg unite, the nucleus of the egg cell fin-
ishes meiosis just before the nuclei of the sperm and egg fuse to complete 
the process of fertilization. (In human males, meiosis begins in puberty, is 
ongoing, and continues without the pauses that occur in females.)

Roughly 75 percent of the nondisjunctions responsible for Down syndrome 
occur during the first phase of meiosis. Oddly, most of the chromosomes that 
fail to segregate seem also to have failed to undergo crossing-over, suggest-
ing that the events leading up to nondisjunction begin early in life. Scientists 
have proposed a number of explanations for the cause of nondisjunction and 
its associated lack of crossing-over, but they haven’t reached an agreement 
about what actually happens in the cell to prevent the chromosomes from 
segregating properly.
 
Every pregnancy is an independent genetic event. So although age is a factor 
in calculating risk of trisomy 21, Down syndrome with previous pregnancies 
doesn’t necessarily increase a woman’s risk of having another child affected 
by the disorder.
Some environmental factors have been implicated in Down syndrome that 
may increase the risk for women younger than 30. Scientists think that 
women who smoke while on oral contraceptives (birth control pills) may 
have a higher risk of decreased blood flow to their ovaries. When egg cells 
are starved for oxygen, they’re less likely to develop normally, and nondis-
junction may be more likely to occur.

230
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Familial Down syndrome
A second form of Down syndrome, familial Down syndrome, is unrelated to 
maternal age. This disorder occurs as a result of the fusion of chromosome 
21 to another autosome (often chromosome 14). This fusion is usually the 
result of a translocation — what happens when nonhomologous chromo-
somes exchange parts. In this case, the exchange involves the long arm of 
chromosome 21 and the short arm of chromosome 14. This sort of transloca-
tion is called a Robertsonian translocation. The leftover parts of chromosomes 
14 and 21 also fuse together but are usually lost to cell division and aren’t 
inherited. When a Robertsonian translocation occurs, affected persons can 
end up with several sorts of chromosome combinations in their gametes, as 
shown in Figure 15-4.
For familial Down syndrome, a translocation carrier has one normal copy of 
chromosome 21, one normal copy of chromosome 14, and one fused trans-
location chromosome. Carriers aren’t affected by Down syndrome because 
their fused chromosome acts as a second copy of the normal chromosome. 
When a carrier’s cells undergo meiosis, some of their gametes have one 
translocated chromosome or get the normal complement that includes one 
copy of each chromosome. Fertilizations of gametes with a translocated 
chromosome and a normal chromosome 21 produce the phenotype of Down 
syndrome. Roughly 10 percent of the liveborn children of carriers have tri-
somy 21. Carriers have a greater chance than normal of miscarriage because 
of monosomy (of either 21 or 14) and trisomy 14.

Other trisomies
Trisomy 18, also called Edward syndrome, also results from nondisjunc-
tion. About 1 in 6,000 newborns has trisomy 18, making it the second most 
common trisomy in humans. The disorder is characterized by severe birth 
defects including severe heart defects and brain abnormalities. Other defects 
associated with trisomy 18 include a small jaw relative to the face, clenched 
fingers, rigid muscles, and foot defects. Most affected infants with trisomy 18 
don’t live past their first birthdays. Like trisomy 21, the chance of having a 
baby with trisomy 18 is higher in women who become pregnant when they’re 
older than 35.
The third most common trisomy in humans is trisomy 13, or Patau syndrome. 
About 1 in 12,000 live births is affected by trisomy 13; many embryos with 
this condition miscarry early in pregnancy. Babies born with trisomy 13 have 
a very short life expectancy — most die before the age of 6 months. However, 
some may survive until 2 or 3 years of age; records show that two children 
with Patau syndrome lived well into childhood (one died at 11 and the other 
at 19). Babies affected by trisomy 13 have extremely severe brain defects 
along with many facial structure defects. Absent or very small eyes and 
other defects of the eye, cleft lips, cleft palates, heart defects, and polydactyly 
(extra fingers and toes) are common among these children.
Another type of trisomy, trisomy 8, occurs very rarely (1 in 25,000 to 50,000 
births). Children born with trisomy 8 have a normal life expectancy but often 
are affected by mental retardation and physical defects such as contracted 
fingers and toes.
Other things that go awry 
with chromosomes
In addition to monosomies and trisomies, numerous other chromosomal 
disorders can occur in humans. Whole sets of chromosomes can be added, 
or chromosomes can be broken or rearranged. This section covers some of 
these other sorts of chromosome disorders.
Polyploidy
Polyploidy, the occurrence of more than two sets of chromosomes, is 
extremely rare in humans. Two reported conditions of polyploidy are triploid 
(three full chromosome sets) and tetraploid (four sets). Most polyploid preg-
nancies result in miscarriage or stillbirth. All liveborn infants with triploidy 
have severe, untreatable birth defects, and most don’t survive longer than a 
few days.

232
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Mosaicism
Mosaicism is a form of aneuploidy that creates patches of cells with variable 
numbers of chromosomes. Early in embryo development, a nondisjunction 
similar to the one shown in Figure 15-1 can create two cells that are aneu-
ploid (most often one cell is trisomic, with one extra chromosome copy, and 
the other is monosomic, with a chromosome missing its homolog). A cell 
can also lose a chromosome, leading to a monosomy without an accompa-
nying trisomy. All the cells that descend from the aneuploid cells created 
during mitosis are also aneuploid. The magnitude of the effects of mosaicism 
depends on when the error occurs: If the error happens very early, most of 
the individual’s cells are affected.
Most mosaicisms are lethal except when the mosaic cell line is confined to the 
placenta. Many embryos with placenta mosaics develop normally and suffer 
no ill effects. Sex chromosome mosaics are the most common in humans; 
XO-XXX and XO-XXY are common mosaic genotypes. Trisomy 21 also appears 
as a mosaic with normal diploid cells. Often, individuals with mosaicism are 
affected in the same ways as persons who are entirely aneuploid.
Fragile X syndrome
Many chromosomes have fragile sites — parts of the chromosome that show 
breaks when the cells are exposed to certain drugs or chemicals. Eighty such 
fragile sites are common to all humans, but other sites appear because of 
rare mutations. One such site, fragile X on the X chromosome, is associated 
with the most common inherited form of mental retardation.
Fragile X syndrome results from a mutation in a gene called FMR1 (for Fragile 
Mental Retardation gene 1). Like many X-linked mutations, fragile X syn-
drome is recessive. Therefore, women are usually mutation carriers, and men 
are most often affected by the disorder. Males with fragile X syndrome usu-
ally have some form of mental retardation that can vary in severity from mild 
behavioral or learning disabilities all the way to severe intellectual disabili-
ties and autism. Men and boys with fragile X syndrome often have prominent 
ears and long faces with large jaws.
Fragile X often shows genetic anticipation — that is, the disorder gets more 
severe from one generation to the next. Within FMR1 is a series of three 
bases that are repeated over and over (see Chapter 6 for details about how 
DNA is put together). When the DNA is replicated (or copied; see Chapter 7), 
repeats can easily be added by mistake, making the repeat sequence longer. 
In persons with fragile X syndrome, the three bases can be repeated hun-
dreds of times (instead of the normal 5 to 40). As the gene gets longer, the 
effects of the mutation become more severe, with subsequent offspring suf-
fering stronger effects of the disorder. You can find out more about anticipa-
tion in Chapter 4.

233
 Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders: It’s All a Numbers Game
Rearrangements
Large-scale chromosome changes are called chromosomal rearrangements. 
Four kinds of chromosomal rearrangements, shown in Figure 15-5, are possible:
 
✓ Duplication: Large parts of the chromosome are copied more than once, 
making the chromosome substantially longer.
 
✓ Inversion: A section of the chromosome gets turned around, reversing 
the sequence of genes.
 
✓ Deletion: Large parts of the chromosome are lost.
 
✓ Translocation: Parts are exchanged between nonhomologous 
chromosomes.

All chromosomal rearrangements are mutations. Normally, mutations are very 
small changes within the DNA (that often have very big impacts). Mutations 
that involve only a few bases can’t be detected by staining the chromosomes 
and examining the karyotype (see “What Chromosomes Reveal” for more on 
karyotypes). However, large-scale chromosomal changes can be diagnosed 
from the karyotype because they involve huge sections of the DNA. In 
humans, deletions and duplications are common causes of mental retardation 
and physical defects.
Duplications
Duplications (in this case, large, unwanted copies of portions of the chromo-
some) most often arise from unequal crossing-over (see “Deletions” later in 
this chapter). Most disorders arising from duplications are considered partial 
trisomies because large portions of one chromosome are usually present in 
triplicate.

234
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Duplication of part of chromosome 15 is implicated in one form of autism. 
Autistic persons typically have severe speech impairment, don’t readily 
interact with or respond to other persons, and exhibit ritualized and repeti-
tive behaviors. Mental retardation may or may not be present. Persons with 
autism are difficult to assess because of their impaired ability to communi-
cate. Other chromosomal rearrangements, including large-scale deletions and 
translocations, have also been identified in cases of autism.
Inversions
If a chromosome break occurs, sometimes DNA repair mechanisms 
(explained in Chapter 13) can repair the strands. If two breaks occur, part 
of the chromosome may be reversed before the breaks are repaired. When 
a large part of the chromosome is reversed and the order of the genes is 
changed, the event is called an inversion. When inversions involve the centro-
mere, they’re called pericentric; inversions that don’t include the centromere 
are called paracentric.
Hemophilia type A may be caused, in some cases, by an inversion within the 
X chromosome. Patients with hemophilia have impaired blood clot forma-
tion; as a result, they bruise easily and bleed freely from even very small cuts. 
Mild injuries can result in extremely severe blood loss. Like most X-linked 
disorders, hemophilia is more common in males than females. In this case, 
two genes coding for the clotting factors are interrupted by the inversion, 
rendering both genes nonfunctional.
Deletions
Deletion, or loss, of a large section of a chromosome usually occurs in one of 
two ways:
 
✓ The chromosome breaks during interphase of the cell cycle (see 
Chapter 2 for cell cycle details), and the broken piece is lost when the 
cell divides.
 
✓ Parts of chromosomes are lost because of unequal crossing-over during 
meiosis.
Normally, when chromosomes start meiosis, they evenly align end to end 
with no overhanging parts. If chromosomes align incorrectly, crossing-over 
can create a deletion in one chromosome and an insertion of extra DNA in 
the other, as shown in Figure 15-6. Unequal crossover events are more likely 
to occur where many repeats are present in the DNA sequence (see Chapter 
8 for more on DNA sequences).
Cri-du-chat syndrome is a deletion disorder caused by the loss of the short 
arm of chromosome 5 (varying amounts of chromosome 5 can be lost, up to 
60 percent of the arm). Cri-du-chat is French for “cry of the cat” and refers to 
the characteristic, high-pitched cry that infants affected by the syndrome 
make. Cri-du-chat syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition; affected 

235
 Chapter 15: Chromosome Disorders: It’s All a Numbers Game
persons are almost always heterozygous for the mutation. Children with cri-
du-chat syndrome have unusually small heads, round faces, wide-set eyes, 
and intellectual disabilities. Cri-du-chat syndrome is one of the more common 
chromosomal deletions and occurs in about 1 in 20,000 births. Most persons 
with cri-du-chat syndrome don’t survive into adulthood. Because the major-
ity of these deletions are new mutations, affected persons usually have no 
family history of cri-du-chat syndrome.

Deletion of part of the long arm of chromosome 15 results in Prader-Willi 
syndrome. This particular deletion is always in the father’s chromosome, 
and the tendency to pass on the deletion appears to be heritable. Women 
with pregnancies affected by Prader-Willi syndrome usually notice that their 
babies start moving in the womb later and move less than unaffected babies. 
Affected infants are less active and have decreased muscle tone, which some-
times causes breathing problems. These infants have trouble feeding and 
usually don’t grow at a normal rate. Children with Prader-Willi syndrome can 
have mental retardation, but their intellectual disabilities usually aren’t very 
severe. Feeding problems early in life often give way to obesity later on, but 
persons with Prader-Willi syndrome almost always have small stature. Like 
cri-du-chat syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome is often the result of spontane-
ous mutation (see Chapter 12 for more on genetic disorders).
Translocations
Translocations involve the exchange of large portions of chromosomes. They 
occur between nonhomologous chromosomes and come in two types:
 
✓ Reciprocal translocation: An equal (balanced) exchange in which each 
chromosome winds up with part of the other. This is the most common 
form of translocation.
 
✓ Nonreciprocal translocation: An uneven exchange in which one chro-
mosome gains a section but the other chromosome does not, resulting 
in a deletion.

236
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Like inversions, translocations can result from broken chromosomes that get 
mismatched before the repair process is complete. When two chromosomes 
are broken, they can exchange pieces (reciprocal or balanced translocation), 
gain pieces (nonreciprocal translocation), or lose pieces (deletion). When the 
breaks interrupt one or more genes, those genes are rendered nonfunctional.
One disorder in humans that sometimes involves a balanced translocation 
event is bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder may result when chromosomes 
9 and 11 exchange parts, interrupting a gene on chromosome 11. This gene, 
called DIBD1 (for Disrupted in Bipolar Disorder gene 1) has also been impli-
cated in other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.
Chromosomes 11 and 22 are often involved in balanced translocation events 
that cause birth defects (such as cleft palate, heart defects, and mental 
retardation) and a hereditary form of breast cancer. Chromosome 11 seems 
particularly prone to breakage in an area that has many repeated sequences 
(where two bases, A and T, are repeated many times sequentially). Most 
repeated sequences like this one are considered junk DNA (see Chapter 8 for 
an explanation of junk DNA). Because both chromosome 11 and chromosome 
22 contain similar repeat sequences, the repeats may allow crossover events 
to occur by mistake, resulting in a reciprocal translocation.
In many cases, a translocation event occurs spontaneously in one parent, 
who then passes the disrupted chromosomes on to his or her offspring, 
resulting in partial trisomies and partial deletions. In these cases, the carrier 
parents may be unaffected by the disorder.

he completion of the Human Genome Project in 2004 (see Chapter 8), 
along with the sequencing of nonhuman genomes, spawned an incredible 
revolution in the understanding of genetics. Simultaneously, geneticists raced 
to develop medicines to treat and cure diseases caused by genes gone awry. 
Gene therapy, treatment that gets at the direct cause of genetic disorders, is 
sometimes touted as the magic bullet, the cure-all for inherited diseases (see 
Chapter 13) and cancer (see Chapter 14). Gene therapy may even provide a 
way to block the genes of pathogens such as viruses, providing reliable treat-
ments for illnesses that currently have none.
Unfortunately, the shining promise of gene therapy has been hampered by 
a host of challenges, including finding the right way to supply the medicine 
to patients without causing worse problems than the ones being treated. 
Moreover, the genetics of disease have turned out to be far more compli-
cated than anyone anticipated. In this chapter, I examine the progress and 
perils of gene therapy.
Alleviating Genetic Disease
Take a glance through Part III of this book for proof that your health and 
genetics are inextricably linked. Mutations cause disorders that are passed 
from generation to generation, and mutations acquired during your lifetime 
can have unwanted consequences such as cancer. Your own genes aren’t the 
only ones that cause complications — the genes carried by bacteria, para-
sites, and viruses lend a hand in spreading disease and dismay worldwide.

238
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
So wouldn’t it be great if you could just turn off those pesky bad genes? Just 
think: A mutation causes a loss of function in a tumor suppressor gene, and 
you get a shot to turn that gene back on. A virus giving you trouble? Just take 
a pill that blocks the function of viral genes.
Some geneticists see the implementation of these genetic solutions to health 
problems as only a matter of time. Therefore, the development of gene ther-
apy has focused on two major courses of action:
 
✓ Supplying genes to provide desired functions that have been lost or are 
missing
 
✓ Blocking genes from producing unwanted products
Finding Vehicles to Get Genes to Work
The first step in successful gene therapy is designing the right delivery 
system to introduce a new gene or shut down an unwanted one. The delivery 
system for gene therapy is called a vector. A perfect vector
 
✓ Must be innocuous so that the recipient’s immune system doesn’t reject 
or fight the vector.
 
✓ Must be easy to manufacture in large quantities. Just one treatment may 
require over 10 billion copies of the vector, because you need one deliv-
ery vehicle for every cell in the affected organ.
 
✓ Must be targeted for a specific tissue. Gene expression is tissue-specific 
(see Chapter 11 for details), so the vector has to be tissue-specific, too.
 
✓ Must be capable of integrating its genetic payload into each cell of the 
target organ so that new copies of each cell generated later by mitosis 
contain the gene therapy payload.
 
Currently, viruses are the favored vector. Most gene therapies aim to put a 
new gene into the patient’s genome, and this gene-sharing action is almost 
precisely what viruses do naturally.
When a virus latches onto a cell that isn’t protected from the virus, the virus 
hijacks all that cell’s activities for the sole purpose of making more viruses. 
Viruses reproduce this way because they have no moving parts of their own 
to accomplish reproduction. Part of the virus’s attack strategy involves inte-
grating virus DNA into the host genome in order to execute viral gene expres-
sion. The problem is that when a virus is good at attacking a cell, it causes an 
infection that the patient’s immune system fights. So the trick to using a virus 
as a vector is taming it.

239
 Chapter 16: Treating Genetic Disorders with Gene Therapy
Gentling a virus for use as a vector usually involves deleting most of its genes. 
These deletions effectively rob the virus of almost all its DNA, leaving only a 
few bits. These remaining pieces are primarily the parts the virus normally 
uses to get its DNA into the host. Using DNA manipulation techniques like 
those I describe in the “Inserting Healthy Genes into the Picture” section of this 
chapter, the scientist splices a healthy gene sequence into the virus to replace 
the deleted parts of the viral genome. But a helper is needed to move the pay-
load from the virus to the recipient cell, so the scientist sets up another virus 
particle with some of the deleted genes from the vector. This second virus, 
called a helper, makes sure that the vector DNA replicates properly.
Geneticists conducting gene therapy have several viruses to choose from 
as possible delivery vehicles (vectors). These viruses fall into one of two 
classes:
 
✓ Those that integrate their DNA directly into the host’s genome
 
✓ Those that climb into the cell nucleus to become permanent but sepa-
rate residents (called episomes)
Within these two categories, three types of viruses — oncoretroviruses, lenti-
viruses, and adenoviruses — are popular choices for gene therapy.
Viruses that join right in
Two popular viruses for gene therapy integrate their DNA directly into the 
host’s genome. Oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses are retroviruses that trans-
fer their genes into the host genome; when the retrovirus genes are in place, 
they’re replicated right along with the other host DNA. Retroviruses use RNA 
instead of DNA to code their genes and use a process called reverse transcrip-
tion (described in Chapter 11) to convert their RNA into DNA, which is then 
inserted into a host cell’s genome.
Oncoretroviruses, the first vectors developed for gene therapy, get their 
name from oncogenes, which turn the cell cycle on permanently — one of 
the precursors to development of full-blown cancer. Most of the oncoret-
rovirus vectors in use for gene therapy trace their history back to a virus 
that causes leukemia in monkeys (it’s called Moloney murine leukemia virus, 
or MLV). MLV has proven an effective vector, but it’s not without prob-
lems; MLV’s propensity to cause cancer has been difficult to keep in check. 
Oncoretroviruses work well as vectors only if they’re used to treat cells that 
are actively dividing.
Lentiviruses, on the other hand, can be used to treat cells that aren’t divid-
ing. You’re probably already familiar with a famous lentivirus: HIV. Vectors 
for gene therapy were developed directly from the HIV virus itself. Although 

240
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
the gutted virus vectors contain only 5 percent of their original DNA, render-
ing them harmless, lentiviruses have the potential to regain the deleted genes 
if they come in contact with untamed HIV virus particles (that is, the ones 
that infect people with AIDS). Lentiviruses are also a bit dicey because they 
tend to put genes right in the middle of host genes, leading to loss-of-function 
mutations (I detail this and other mutations in Chapter 13).
Nonetheless, HIV lentivirus vectors are used to combat AIDS. The vector 
virus carries a genetic message that gets stored in the patient’s immune cells. 
When HIV attacks these immune cells, the vector DNA blocks the attacking 
virus from replicating itself, effectively protecting the patient from further 
infection. So far, this treatment seems to work, and it substantially reduces 
the amount of virus that affected persons carry.
Viruses that are a little standoffish
Adenoviruses are excellent vectors because they pop their genes into cells 
regardless of whether cell division is occurring. In gene therapy, adenoviruses 
have been both promising and problematic. On the one hand, they’re really 
good at getting into host cells. On the other hand, they tend to excite a strong 
immune response — the patient’s body senses the virus as a foreign particle 
and fights it. To combat the immune reaction, researchers have worked to 
delete the genes that make adenoviruses easy for the host to recognize.
 
Adenoviruses don’t put their DNA directly into the host genome. Instead, they 
exist separately as episomes, so they aren’t as likely as lentiviruses to cause 
mutations. The drawback is that the episomes aren’t always replicated and 
passed on to daughter cells when the host cell divides. Nonetheless, research-
ers have used adenovirus vectors with notable success — and failure. (See 
“Progress on the Gene Therapy Front” at the end of the chapter for the details.)
Inserting Healthy Genes into the Picture
Finding the right delivery system is a necessary step in mastering gene ther-
apy, but to nab genes and put them to work as therapists, geneticists must 
also find the right ones. Because finding healthy genes isn’t simple, gene 
mapping is still a major obstacle in the road to implementing gene therapy. 
Imagine you’re handed a man’s photograph and told to find him in New York 
City — no name, no address, no phone number. The task of finding that man 
includes figuring out his identity (maybe by finding out who his friends are), 
figuring out what he does for a living, narrowing your search to the borough 
he lives in, and identifying his street, block, and finally, his address. This 
wild-goose chase is almost exactly like the gargantuan task of finding genes.

241
 Chapter 16: Treating Genetic Disorders with Gene Therapy
Your DNA has roughly 22,000 genes tucked away among about 3 billion 
base pairs of DNA. (Flip to Chapter 6 to find out how DNA is sized up in 
base pairs.) Because most genes are pretty small, relatively speaking (often 
less than 5,000 base pairs long; see Chapter 9), finding just one gene in the 
midst of all the genetic clutter may sound like a nearly impossible task. 
Until recently, the only tool geneticists had in the search for genes was the 
observation of patterns of inheritance (like those shown in Chapter 12) and 
the subsequent comparisons of how various groups of traits were inherited. 
Geneticists use this method, called linkage analysis, to construct gene maps 
(see Chapter 4). With the advent of DNA sequencing (see Chapter 8), how-
ever, the search for names and addresses of genes has reached a whole new 
level (but the search still isn’t over; see the sidebar “The role of the Human 
Genome Project”). Now, geneticists hook up with an extended network of 
people to nail down the exact locations of genes:
 
✓ Physicians identify a disorder by observing a phenotype caused by 
mutation. Essentially, this is the face of the gene.
 
✓ Genetic counselors work with patients and their families to gather com-
plete medical histories (see Chapter 12). Analysis of family trees may 
uncover other traits that associate with the disorder.
 
✓ Cell biologists look at the karyotypes of many affected people and link 
traits to obvious chromosomal abnormalities. These large-scale changes 
in chromosomes often provide hints about where genes reside. (Chapter 
15 examines methods of karyotyping.)
 
✓ Population geneticists analyze the DNA of large groups of people with 
and without the disease to narrow down which chromosomes and which 
genes are involved with the disease.
 
✓ Biochemists study the chemical processes in the affected organs of 
people with the disease to identify the physiology of the disorder. Often, 
they’re able to nab the precise protein gone wrong.
 
✓ Geneticists, with the protein in hand, use the genetic code (profiled in 
Chapter 10) to work backwards from the building blocks of that protein — 
the specific amino acids — to discern what the mRNA instructions were.
 
Identifying the right protein and backtracking to the mRNA pattern is 
extremely helpful, but it still doesn’t divulge the gene’s identity. Problems 
include the fact that mRNAs are often heavily edited before they’re translated 
into proteins (see Chapter 10) and the fact that the code is degenerate, mean-
ing that more than one codon can be used to get a particular amino acid. The 
protein provides a general idea of what the gene address is, but it’s not pre-
cise enough. To close in on the right address, the gene hunter has to sort 
through the DNA itself.

242
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
The entire gene-hunting safari depends on vast computer databases that the 
scientific community can easily access. These databases allow investigators 
to search professional journals to keep up with new discoveries by other sci-
entists. Researchers are also constantly adding new pieces of the puzzle — 
such as newly identified proteins — to storehouses of data.
 
You can take a peek into the genetic data warehouse by visiting www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=OMIM. The NCBI link in the upper 
left part of the page leads you to the home page of the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information. From there, you can explore everything from DNA 
to protein data compiled by scientists from around the world.
 
Recombinant DNA technology is the catchall phrase that covers most of the 
methods geneticists use to examine DNA in the lab. The word recombinant is 
used because DNA from the organism being studied is often popped into a 
virus or bacteria (that is, it’s recombined with DNA from a different source) to 
allow further study. Scientists also use recombinant DNA for a vast number of 
other applications, including creating genetically engineered organisms (see 
Chapter 19) and cloning (see Chapter 20). In the case of gene therapy, recom-
binant DNA is used to
The role of the Human Genome Project
Can’t geneticists just look up the genes they 
need from all the sequencing data collected by 
the Human Genome Project, or HGP? Someday 
the answer will be yes, but we’re not there 
yet. By 2005, 99 percent of the gene-rich part 
of the genome (called the euchromatin) was 
fully sequenced. That’s the good news. The 
bad news for gene hunters is that a whopping 
20 percent of the noncoding regions of the 
genome still aren’t sequenced.
The noncoding part of the genome (the het-
erochromatin) has been tough to work with 
because it’s made up of repetitive sequences. 
All that repetition makes putting the sequences 
into their proper order extremely difficult. For 
example, researchers still argue about how 
many total genes there are (probably around 
22,000, but possibly more or fewer). And many 
genes are yet to be discovered; what they 
control and where they’re located are still 
unknown.
Unfortunately, the maps that the HGP con-
structed of the entire humane genome are 
drawn at the wrong scale to be useful for pin-
pointing the locations of genes. To get an idea 
of how scale can be a problem, think about 
looking at a road map. A low-resolution high-
way map can help you find your way from one 
city to another, but it can’t guide you to a very 
specific street address in a particular city.
What it comes down to is that geneticists con-
tinue to explore the billions of base pairs that 
contain the genetic instructions that make 
humans tick. That’s why the gene hunt is likely 
to go on for a long time to come. (For full cover-
age of the HGP, flip to Chapter 8.)

✓ Locate the gene (or genes) involved in a particular disorder or disease
 
✓ Cut the desired gene out of the surrounding DNA
 
✓ Pop the gene into a vector (delivery vehicle) for transfer into the cells 
where treatment is needed
Checking out a DNA library
One of the most popular methods for tracking down a specific gene is to 
create a DNA library. That’s just what it sounds like: a library filled with 
chunks of DNA instead of books. Geneticists can paw through the library to 
nail down the piece of DNA containing the gene of interest. One popular ver-
sion of the genetic library method is called a cDNA library — a collection of 
genetic instruction manuals that are actually in use in a specific cell (the c 
stands for complementary because the whole process actually starts by copy-
ing mRNA messages into complementary DNA format).
 
The idea behind a cDNA library is to harvest all the mRNAs in a cell that’s 
involved in some genetic disease (you can find out more about RNA in 
Chapter 8). Because gene expression is tissue-specific (see Chapter 10), the 
mRNAs in any given cell represent only the genes that are at work there. So 
instead of plowing through all 22,000 genes of the human genome to find the 
one that’s in trouble, geneticists can narrow the target to only the few hun-
dred that are in a particular cell.
Harvesting and converting mRNA
The first step in creating a cDNA library is harvesting mRNAs, and the fastest 
way to nab mRNAs is to grab their tails. When an mRNA is getting dressed for 
its trip out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm for translation, a long string 
of adenine ribonucleotides gets hitched on the mRNA’s back. This string, 
called a poly-A tail, helps protect the mRNA from decomposing before it fin-
ishes its job. To find the mRNAs that a cell’s genes produce, geneticists use 
chemicals to break open cells, and then they strain out the mRNAs by expos-
ing their tails to long strings of thymine nucleotides. The As (adenines) in the 
tails naturally hook up with the complementary Ts (thymines) because of the 
bases’ natural affinities for each other.
Undergoing reverse transcription
After scientists harvest a cell’s mRNAs, they convert the mRNAs’ messages 
back to DNA by reversing the transcription process. Reverse transcription 
works a lot like DNA replication (see Chapter 7). The primer used for reverse 
transcription is a long string of Ts (thymines) complementary to the mRNA’s 
poly-A tail. A special enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is isolated 
from a virus, tacks dNTPs onto the primer to create a DNA copy of the mRNA.

244
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
After the DNA copy is made, the order of the bases — the As, Gs, Cs, and 
Ts — on the 5’ end of the DNA sequence is determined (flip to Chapter 6 for 
how DNA’s ends are numbered) using DNA sequencing (see Chapter 11). This 
partial DNA sequence (about 500 bases or so) is referred to as an expressed 
sequence tag (EST). It’s expressed because only the exons are present in the 
DNA sequence, and tag comes from the fact that only part of the entire gene 
sequence is obtained (and therefore “tagged”).
Screening the library
With ESTs created (see the preceding section), gene hunters examine every 
“book” in the cDNA library to find the particular gene that causes the disease. 
This process is called screening the library. The idea here is to spread out all 
the ESTs and sort through them to find the precise EST that came from the 
gene scientists are looking for. The difficulty of screening the library depends 
on what scientists already know about the gene. For example, knowing which 
protein is the one that’s gone wrong can provide enough genetic information 
to give scientists a head start in their search. Sometimes, geneticists even 
look at what’s known about genes with similar functions in other organisms 
and start there.
Regardless of the clues available to the gene hunter, screening involves 
making thousands of identical copies, or clones, of each EST by popping it 
into a bacteria or virus. Because ESTs are so tiny (DNA-wise), it’s impossible 
to manipulate only one copy at a time. The cloning process separates the 
ESTs into neat, little, identical stacks, each composed of thousands of copies 
of only one EST.
One method that geneticists use to clone ESTs is called bacteriophage clon-
ing. Bacteriophages (phages, for short) are handy little viruses that make a 
living by injecting their DNA directly into bacterial cells.
 
To infect bacterial cells, bacteriophages hop onto the outer cell wall and inject 
their DNA into the bacterium, where the phage DNA integrates directly into the 
bacterium’s own DNA. The viral genes get replicated, transcribed, and ulti-
mately translated using the machinery of the bacterial cells. Eventually, the 
phage genes set off a new phase that breaks up the bacterial DNA and frees the 
phage genome. The phage DNA gets replicated many times within the bacterial 
cells, and new phage protein shells are also produced. The bacterial cells even-
tually burst open, freeing the newly completed phages to infect other cells.
Here’s how these funky-looking viruses get harnessed to make copies of ESTs:
 
1. Geneticists take a mixture of ESTs and splice them into the DNA of 
thousands of bacteriophages.
 
 To splice the ESTs into the phages, the phage DNA (which is circular) is 
cut open using a restriction enzyme. Restriction enzymes cut DNA at sites 
called palindromes, where the complementary sequence of bases reads 
the same way backwards and forwards (like 5’-GATC-3’, whose 

245
 Chapter 16: Treating Genetic Disorders with Gene Therapy
complement is 3’-CTAG-5’). The restriction enzyme always cuts between 
the same two bases, like the G and the A, on both strands. When pulled 
apart, the resulting pair of cuts leaves overhanging, single-stranded ends 
on one long piece of phage DNA. The ESTs are treated with enzymes to 
give them sticky ends — overhanging bits complementary to the ends left 
in the phage DNA. When mixed together, the phage DNA and the ESTs 
match their sticky ends together, completing the circle of phage DNA 
except that each copy of the phage now contains an EST along with its 
own DNA.
 
2. The EST-carrying phages are mixed with their favorite victims — 
bacteria — and poured into Petri dishes.
 
3. After the viruses spread out and do their jobs (about 24 hours after 
the mixing with bacteria), the result is little pits in an otherwise uni-
form layer of bacteria growing in the Petri dish.
 
 Each little pit, called a plaque, represents infection caused by one phage 
that has reproduced and, by a chain reaction of infections, caused many 
bacterial cells to die and pop open. Each individual infection site repre-
sents many thousands of copies of one EST.
With thousands of ESTs and their copies, the only task that remains is finding 
the EST that’s associated with the gene being hunted. Using the protein gone 
wrong as a guide, scientists can make a guess at what the EST may look like. 
After they decide what kind of DNA sequence may complement the EST, they 
order a special kit of DNA, called a probe, that’s custom-made to match the 
sequence they want. The probe is complementary to all or part of the EST in 
question, and it’s marked with dye so that scientists can find it after it bonds 
with the EST. Each EST is treated to make it single-stranded, and the ESTs are 
exposed to the probe. The probe forms a double-stranded molecule only with 
the EST that it matches; scientists find the matched set with special equip-
ment that allows the dye to glow brightly.
Scientists can also use an EST to search among chromosomes to nail down 
the general location of a gene. The geneticist makes a karyotype — a collec-
tion of all the chromosomes that can be examined under the microscope (see 
Chapter 15). The geneticist treats the chromosomes to allow the fluorescent-
dyed EST to bind with its complement on the intact chromosomes. The dyed 
EST sticks to the nontemplate strand from which its mRNA counterpart 
came. Scientists can see the results of this process with the help of a spe-
cial microscope: The region where the EST attaches to its complement (the 
attachment process is called hybridization) reflects brightly under ultraviolet 
light. This entire procedure, called fluorescent in situ hybridization (or FISH, 
for short), allows researchers to target a region of a particular chromosome 
for their gene hunt, but it isn’t very specific because of the way DNA is pack-
aged (see Chapter 6). In essence, FISH narrows the target to a few million 
base pairs for scrutiny. But this isn’t the last piece of the puzzle: With only 
part of the address (provided by the right EST) and the street name (the 
chromosome), gene hunters need to make a high-resolution map to complete 
their search successfully.

246
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
Mapping the gene
Thanks to the progress of the Human Genome Project, scientists have maps 
for each of the chromosomes, and each map has many landmarks, called 
sequence tagged sites (STSs for short). Sequence tagged sites are short 
stretches of unique combinations of bases scattered around the chromo-
some. No two STSs are alike, so they provide unique landmarks wherever 
they occur. A complete STS map reveals the total distance from one end 
of the chromosome to the other (in base pairs), as well as the landmarks 
along the way. Having an STS map is a bit like knowing the locations of 
Times Square, the Empire State Building, and Central Park relative to the 
entire island of Manhattan. You may know that a street you’re looking for is 
between Central Park and the Empire State Building, but there are hundreds 
of little blocks to choose from in an area that size. STSs and other land-
marks in the genome are a lot like that — scientists may know that an EST is 
between two STSs, but the STSs themselves may be 20,000 bases apart!
Using the nabbed EST as a starting point, geneticists sequence the DNA of 
the chromosome in both directions in a process called chromosome walk-
ing. Basically, they have to compile enough sequence information to run 
across at least two STS landmarks on the map — one in each direction. To 
continue with the city analogy, chromosome walking is like laying maps 
of neighborhoods together end to end until two major landmarks are con-
nected. Chromosome walking provides the last two vital pieces in the puzzle: 
the exact location of the gene relative to the rest of the chromosome and 
(finally!) the entire gene sequence associated with the EST.
 
With new technology and knowledge of the genome, mapping genes is getting 
easier and easier. Projects like HapMap (covered in Chapter 17) have identi-
fied differences at the level of single nucleotides (flip to Chapter 7 to get the 
scoop on these DNA building blocks). These tiny differences, called SNPs (pro-
nounced “snips,” for Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms), provide such a power-
ful way to map genes that building a library may become unnecessary.
After researchers precisely map a gene, they compare the gene sequences 
of many people (both with and without a particular disease) to determine 
exactly what the mutation is (that is, how the gene differs between affected 
and unaffected people). All this information eventually winds up in the data-
base Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man.
After the gene is located, many thousands of precise replicas of a healthier 
version of the gene can be made through a polymerase chain reaction, the 
process used for DNA fingerprinting (see Chapter 18). Researchers pop the 
copies of the healthy gene into the vector used for gene therapy with the 
same methods that they used to make the cDNA library described here.

247
 Chapter 16: Treating Genetic Disorders with Gene Therapy
Progress on the Gene Therapy Front
As the Human Genome Project (HGP) started fulfilling the dreams of geneti-
cists worldwide, realizing gene therapy’s promises seemed very much in 
reach. In fact, the first trials conducted in 1990 were a resounding success.
In those first attempts at gene therapy, two patients suffering from the 
same immunodeficiency disorder received infusions of cells carrying genes 
coding for their missing enzymes. The disorder was a form of severe com-
bined immunodeficiency (SCID) that results from the loss of one enzyme: 
adenosine deaminase (ADA). SCID is so severe that affected persons must 
live in completely sterilized environments with no contact with the outside 
world, because even the slightest infection is likely to prove deadly. Because 
only one gene is involved, SCID is a natural candidate for treatment with 
gene therapy. In the HGP, retroviruses armed with a healthy ADA gene were 
infused into the two affected children with dramatic results: Both children 
were essentially cured of the disease and now lead normal lives.
Other implementation of gene therapies have met with mixed results. At least 
17 children have been treated for an X-linked version of SCID. These chil-
dren also received a retrovirus loaded with a healthy gene and were appar-
ently cured. However, four of the children have since been diagnosed with a 
cancer of the blood, leukemia. The virus that delivered the gene also plopped 
its DNA right into a proto-oncogene, switching it on (flip to Chapter 14 for 
more about the actions of oncogenes).
 
The most famous failure of gene therapy occurred in 1999, when 18-year-old 
Jesse Gelsinger volunteered for a study aimed at curing a genetic disorder 
called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency. With this disorder, Jesse 
occasionally suffered a huge buildup of ammonia in his body because his liver 
lacked enough of the OTC enzyme to process all the nitrogen waste products 
in his blood. Jesse’s disease was controlled medically — with drugs and diet — 
but other affected children often die of the disease. Researchers used an ade-
novirus to deliver a normal OTC gene directly into Jesse’s liver. (See the earlier 
section “Viruses that are a little standoffish” for the scoop on adenoviruses.) 
The virus escaped into Jesse’s bloodstream and accumulated in his other 
organs. His body went into high gear to fight what seemed like a massive infec-
tion, and four days after receiving the treatment that was meant to cure him, 
Jesse died. Oddly, another volunteer in the same experimental trial received 
the same dose of virus that Jesse did and suffered no ill effects at all.
Not all the news has been bad. In 2009, researchers announced a successful 
trial of gene therapy for colorblindness in monkeys. The monkeys, which 
had a form of red-green colorblindness similar to the sort that humans get, 
were given viruses bearing a functional form of the missing gene. A few 

248
Part III: Genetics and Your Health 
weeks later, the monkeys were able to see colors that they were unable to 
see prior to the therapy. Also in 2009, scientists reported that by adding 
three genes to brains of monkeys suffering from a form of Parkinson’s dis-
ease, the animals showed a decrease in the involuntary movements that 
accompany the disease.
Though recent results seem optimistic, the struggle to find appropriate vec-
tors continues. The future of gene therapy is complicated by discoveries that 
most genetic disorders involve several genes on different chromosomes. Not 
only that, but many different genes can cause a given disease (diabetes, for 
example, is associated with genes on at least five different chromosomes), 
making it difficult to know which gene to treat. Finally, some genes are so 
large, such as the gene for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, that typical vec-
tors can’t carry them.

t’s impossible to overestimate the influence of genetics on our planet. 
Every living thing depends on DNA for its life, and all living things, includ-
ing humans, share DNA sequences. The amazing similarities between your 
DNA and the DNA of other living things suggest that all living things trace 
their history back to a single source. In a very real sense, all creatures great 
and small are related somehow.
You can examine the genetic underpinnings of life in all sorts of ways. One 
powerful method for understanding the patterns hidden in your DNA is to 
compare the DNA of many individuals as a group. This specialty, called 
population genetics, is a powerful tool. Geneticists use this tool to study not 
only human populations but also animal populations to understand how to 
protect endangered species, for example. By comparing DNA sequences of 
various species, scientists also infer how natural selection acts to create evo-
lutionary change. In this chapter, you find out how scientists analyze genet-
ics of populations and species to understand where we came from and where 
we’re going.
Genetic Variation Is Everywhere
The next time you find yourself channel surfing on the TV, pause a moment 
on one of the channels devoted to science or animals. The diversity of life on 
earth is truly amazing. In fact, scientists still haven’t discovered all the spe-
cies living on our planet; the vast rain forests of South America, the deep-sea 
vents of the ocean, and even volcanoes hold undiscovered species.

Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
 
The interconnectedness of all living things, from a scientific perspective, can’t 
be overstated. The sum total of all the life on earth is referred to as biodiver-
sity. Biodiversity is self-sustaining and is life itself. Together, the living things 
of this planet provide oxygen for you (and everything else) to breathe, carbon 
dioxide to keep plants alive and regulate the temperature and weather, rain-
water for you and your food supply, nutrient cycling to nourish every single 
creature on earth, and countless other functions.
Biodiversity provides so many essential functions for human life that these 
services have been valued at $33 trillion a year (yes, that’s trillion with a “t”). 
(In case you’re wondering, researchers manage to put dollar values on func-
tions that the earth performs naturally, like rainfall, oxygen production, nutri-
ent cycles, soil formation, and pollination, to name a few.)
Underlying the world’s biodiversity is genetic variation. When you look 
around at the people you know, you see enormous variation in height, hair 
and eye color, skin tone, body shape — you name it. That phenotypic (physi-
cal) variation implies that each person differs genetically, too. Likewise, the 
individuals in all populations of other sexually reproducing organisms vary in 
phenotype and genotype as well. Scientists describe the genetic variation in 
populations (defined as groups of interbreeding organisms that exist together 
in both time and space) in two ways:
 
✓ Allele frequencies: How often do various alleles (alternate versions of a 
particular section of DNA) show up in a population?
 
✓ Genotype frequencies: What proportion of a population has a certain 
genotype?
 
Allele frequencies and genotype frequencies are both ways of measuring the 
contents of the gene pool. The gene pool refers to all the possible alleles of all 
the various genes that, collectively, all the individuals of any particular spe-
cies have. Genes get passed around in the form of alleles that are carried from 
parent to child as the result of sexual reproduction. (Of course, genes can be 
passed around without sex — viruses leave their genes all over the place. See 
Chapter 14 for one way in which viruses leave their genetic legacies.)
Allele frequencies
Alleles are various versions of a particular section of DNA (like alleles for eye 
color; flip to Chapter 3 for a review of terms used in genetics). Most genes 
have many different alleles. Geneticists use DNA sequencing (which I explain 
in Chapter 8) to examine genes and determine how many alleles may exist. 
To count alleles, they examine the DNA of many different individuals and look 
for differences among base pairs — the As, Gs, Ts, and Cs — that comprise 
DNA. For the purposes of population genetics, scientists also look for individ-
ual differences in junk DNA (DNA that doesn’t appear to code for phenotype; 

253
 Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
see Chapter 18 for more about how noncoding DNA is used to provide DNA 
fingerprints).
Some alleles are very common, and others are rare. To identify and describe 
patterns of commonness and rarity, population geneticists calculate allele 
frequencies. What geneticists want to know is what proportion of a popula-
tion has a particular allele. This information can be vitally important for 
human health. For example, geneticists have discovered that some people 
carry an allele that makes them immune to HIV infection, the virus that 
causes AIDS.
 
An allele’s frequency — how often the allele shows up in a population — is 
pretty easy to calculate: Simply divide the number of copies of a particular 
allele by the number of copies of all the alleles represented in the population 
for that particular gene.
 
If you know the number of homozygotes (individuals having two identical 
copies of a particular allele) and heterozygotes (individuals having two differ-
ent alleles of a gene), you can set the problem up using these two equations: 
p + q = 1 or q = 1 – p. In a two-allele system, a lowercase letter p is usually 
used to represent one allele frequency, and q is used for the other. Always, 
p + q must equal 1 (or 100 percent). For example, say you want to know the 
frequency for the dominant allele (R) for round peas in a population of plants 
like the ones Mendel studied (see Chapter 3 for all the details about Mendel’s 
experiments). You know that there are 60 RR plants, 50 Rr plants, and 20 rr 
plants. To determine the allele frequency for R (referred to as p), you multiply 
the number of RR plants by 2 (because each plant has two R alleles) and add 
that value to the number of Rr plants: 60 × 2 = 120 + 50 = 170. Divide the sum, 
170, by two times the total plants in the population (because each plant as two 
alleles), or 2(60 + 50 + 20) = 260. The result is 0.55, meaning that 55 percent of 
the population of peas have the allele R. To get the frequency of r (that is, q), 
simply subtract 0.55 from 1.
 
The situation gets pretty complicated, mathematically speaking, when several 
alleles are present, but the take-home message of allele frequency is still the 
same: All allele frequencies are the proportion of the population carrying at 
least one copy of the allele. And all the allele frequencies in a given population 
must add to 1 (which can be expressed as 100 percent, if you prefer).
Genotype frequencies
Most organisms have two copies of every gene (that is, they’re diploid). 
Because the two copies don’t necessarily have to be identical, individuals 
can be either heterozygous or homozygous for any given gene. Like alleles, 
genotypes can vary in frequency. Genotypic frequencies tell you what pro-
portion of individuals in a population are homozygous and, by extension, 

254
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
what proportion are heterozygous. Depending on how many alleles are pres-
ent in a population, many different genotypes can exist. Regardless, the sum 
total of all the genotype frequencies for a particular locus (location on a par-
ticular chromosome; see Chapter 2 for details) must equal 1 (or 100 percent 
if you work in percentage instead of proportion).
To calculate a genotypic frequency, you need to know the total number of 
individuals who have a particular genotype. For example, suppose you’re 
dealing with a population of 100 individuals; 25 individuals are homozygous 
recessive (aa), and 30 are heterozygous (Aa). The frequency of the three 
genotypes (assuming there are only two alleles, A and a) is shown in the fol-
lowing, where the total population is represented by N.
Frequency of AA = 
Number of AA individuals 
N 
Frequency of Aa = 
Number of Aa individuals 
N 
Frequency of aa = 
Number of aa individuals

Allele frequency and genotype frequency are very closely related concepts 
because genotypes are derived from combinations of alleles. It’s easy to 
see from Mendelian inheritance (see Chapter 3) and pedigree analysis (see 
Chapter 12) that if an allele is very common, homozygosity is going to be high. 
It turns out that the relationship between allele frequency and homozygos-
ity is quite predictable. Most of the time, you can use allele frequencies to 
estimate genotypic frequencies using a genetic relationship called the Hardy-
Weinberg law of population genetics, which I explain in the next section.
Breaking Down the Hardy-Weinberg Law 
of Population Genetics
 
Godfrey Hardy and Wilheim Weinberg never met, yet their names are forever 
linked in the annals of genetics. In 1908, both men, completely independent of 
each other, came up with the equation that describes how genotypic frequen-
cies are related to allele frequencies. Their set of simple and elegant equations 
accurately describes the genetics of populations for most organisms. What 
Hardy and Weinberg realized was that in a two-allele system, all things being 
equal, homozygosity and heterozygosity balance out. Figure 17-1 shows how 
the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, as this genetic balancing act is known, looks in 
a graph.

255
 Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
Relating alleles to genotypes
 
An equilibrium occurs when something is in a state of balance. Genetically, an 
equilibrium means that certain values remain unchanged over the course of 
time. The Hardy-Weinberg law says that allele and genotype frequencies will 
remain unchanged, generation after generation, as long as certain conditions 
are met. In order for a population’s genetics to follow Hardy-Weinberg’s 
relationships:
 
✓ The organism must reproduce sexually and be diploid. Sex provides 
the opportunity to achieve different combinations of alleles, and the 
whole affair (pardon the pun) depends on having alleles in pairs (but 
many alleles can be used; you’re not limited to two at a time).
 
✓ The allele frequencies must be the same in both sexes. If alleles 
depend entirely on maleness or femaleness, the relationships don’t fall 
into place, because not all offspring have an equal chance to inherit the 
alleles — alleles on the Y chromosome (see Chapter 5) violate Hardy-
Weinberg rules.
 
✓ The loci must segregate independently. Independent segregation of 
loci is the heart of Mendelian genetics, and Hardy-Weinberg is directly 
derived from Mendel’s laws.
 
✓ Mating must be random with respect to genotype. Matings between 
individuals have to be random, meaning that organisms don’t sort them-
selves out based on the genotype in question.

Hardy-Weinberg makes other assumptions about the populations it 
describes, but the relationship is pretty tolerant of violations of those 
expectations. Not so with the four aforementioned conditions. When one of 
the four major assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg isn’t met, the relationship 
between allele frequency and genotype frequency usually starts to fall apart.
The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium relationship is often illustrated graphically, 
and the Hardy-Weinberg graph is fairly easy to interpret. On the left side of the 
graph in Figure 17-1 is the genotypic frequency (as a percentage of the total 
population going from 0 at the bottom to 100 percent at the top). Across the 
bottom of the graph is the frequency of the recessive allele, a (going 0 to 100 
percent, left to right). To find the relationship between genotype frequency and 
allele frequency according to Hardy-Weinberg, just follow a straight line up from 
the bottom and then read the value off the left side of the graph. For example, 
if you want to know what proportion of the population is homozygous aa when 
the allele frequency of a is 40 percent, start at the 40 percent mark along the 
bottom of the graph and follow a path straight up (shown in Figure 17-1 with a 
dashed line) until you get to the line marked aa (which describes the genotype 
frequency for aa). Take a horizontal path (indicated by the arrow) to the left 
and read the genotypic frequency. In this example, 20 percent of the population 
is expected to be aa when 40 percent of the population carries the a allele.
It makes sense that when the allele a is rare, aa homozygotes are rare, too. 
As allele a becomes more common, the frequency of homozygotes slowly 
increases. The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype, AA, 
behaves the same way but as a mirror image of aa (the genotype frequency 
for aa) because of the relationship of the alleles A to a in terms of their own 
frequency: p + q must equal 1. If p is large, q must be small and vice versa.
Check out the humped line in the middle of Figure 17-1. This is the frequency 
of heterozygotes, Aa. The highest proportion of the population that can 
be heterozygous is 50 percent. You may guess that’s the case just by play-
ing around with monohybrid crosses like those I describe in Chapter 3. No 
matter what combination of matings you try (AA with aa, Aa with Aa, Aa 
with aa, and so on), the largest proportion of Aa offspring you can ever get 
is 50 percent. Thus, when 50 percent of the population is heterozygous, the 
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium predicts that 25 percent of the population will 
be homozygous for the A allele, and 25 percent will be homozygous for the 
a allele. This situation occurs only when p is equal to q — in other words, p 
equals q equals 50 percent.
Many loci obey the rules of the Hardy-Weinberg law in spite of the fact that 
the assumptions required for the relationship aren’t met. One of the major 
assumptions that’s often violated among humans is random mating. People 
tend to marry each other based on their similarities, such as religious back-
ground, skin color, and ethnic characteristics. For example, people of simi-
lar socioeconomic background tend to marry each other more often than 
chance would predict. Nevertheless, many human genes are still in Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium. That’s because matings may be dependent on some 

257
 Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
characteristics but are still independent with respect to the genes. The gene 
that confers immunity to HIV is a good example of a locus in humans that 
obeys the Hardy-Weinberg law despite the fact that its frequency was shaped 
by a deadly disease.
Violating the law
Populations can wind up out of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in several ways. 
One of the most common departures from Hardy-Weinberg occurs as a result 
of inbreeding. Put simply, inbreeding happens when closely related individu-
als mate and produce offspring. Purebred dog owners are often faced with 
this problem because certain male dogs sire many puppies, and a generation 
or two later, descendents of the same male are mated to each other. (In fact, 
selective inbreeding is what created the various dog breeds to begin with.)
Inbreeding tends to foul up Hardy-Weinberg because some alleles start to 
show up more and more often than others. In addition, homozygotes get more 
common, meaning fewer and fewer heterozygotes are produced. Ultimately, 
the appearance of recessive phenotypes becomes more likely. For example, 
the appearance of hereditary problems in some breeds of animals, such as 
deafness among Dalmatian dogs, is a result of generations of inbreeding.
The high incidence of particular genetic disorders among certain groups of 
people, such as Amish communities (see Chapter 12), is also a result of inbreed-
ing. Even if people in a group aren’t all that closely related anymore, if a small 
number of people started the group, everyone in the group is related somehow. 
(Relatedness shows up genetically even within large human populations; take a 
look at the section “Mapping the Gene Pool” in this chapter to find out how.)
 
Loss of heterozygosity is thought to signal a population in peril. Populations 
with low levels of heterozygosity are more vulnerable to disease and stress, 
and that vulnerability increases the probability of extinction. Much of what’s 
known about loss of heterozygosity and resulting problems with health of 
individuals — a situation ironically called inbreeding depression — comes 
from observations of captive animals, like those in zoos. Many animals in 
zoos are descended from captive populations, populations that had very few 
founders to begin with. For example, all captive snow leopards are reportedly 
descended from a mere seven animals.
Not just captive animals are at risk. As habitats for animals become more 
and more altered by human activity, natural populations get chopped up, 
isolated, and dwindle in size. Conservation geneticists, like yours truly, work 
to understand how human activities affect natural populations of birds and 
animals. See the sidebar “Genetics and the modern ark” for more about how 
zoos and conservation geneticists work to protect animals from inbreeding 
depression and rescue species from extinction.

258
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Mapping the Gene Pool
When the exchange of alleles, or gene flow, between groups is limited, popula-
tions take on unique genetic signatures. In general, unique alleles are created 
through mutations (see Chapter 13). If groups of organisms are geographi-
cally separated and rarely exchange mates, mutant alleles become common 
within populations. What this amounts to is that some alleles are found in 
only certain groups, giving each group a unique genetic identity. (After some 
time, these alleles usually conform to a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium within 
each population; see the section “Breaking Down the Hardy-Weinberg Law of 
Population Genetics” for details.) Geneticists identify genetic signatures of 
Genetics and the modern ark
As human populations grow and expand, natu-
ral populations of plants and animals start get-
ting squeezed out of the picture. One of the 
greatest challenges of modern biology is figur-
ing out a way to secure the fate of worldwide 
biodiversity. Preserving biodiversity often takes 
two routes: establishment of protected areas 
and captive breeding.
Protected areas such as parks set aside areas 
of land or sea to protect all the creatures (ani-
mals and plants) that reside within its borders. 
Some of the finest examples of such efforts are 
found among America’s national parks. But 
although protecting special areas helps pre-
serve biodiversity, these islands of biodiversity 
also allow populations to become isolated. With 
isolation, smaller populations start to inbreed, 
resulting in genetic disease and vulnerability 
to extinction. Sometimes, it’s necessary for 
conservation geneticists to step in and lend 
a hand to rescue these isolation populations 
from genetic peril. For example, greater prai-
rie chickens were common in the Midwest at 
one time. By 1990, their populations were tiny 
and isolated. Isolation contributed to inbreed-
ing, causing their eggs to fail to hatch. In order 
to help rebuild a healthy population, biolo-
gists brought in more birds from populations 
elsewhere to increase genetic diversity. The 
strategy worked — the prairie chickens’ eggs 
now hatch with healthy chicks that are hoped 
to bring the population back from the brink of 
extinction.
Captive breeding efforts by zoos, wildlife parks, 
and botanical gardens are also credited with 
preserving species. Twenty-five animal spe-
cies that are completely extinct in the wild still 
survive in zoos thanks to captive breeding pro-
grams. Most programs are designed to provide 
not only insurance against extinction but also 
breeding stock for eventual reintroduction into 
the wild. Unfortunately, zoo populations often 
descend from very small founder populations, 
causing considerable problems with inbreed-
ing. Inbreeding leads to fertility problems and 
the death of offspring shortly after birth. In 
the last 20 years, zoos and similar facilities 
have worked to combat inbreeding by keeping 
track of pedigrees (like the ones that appear 
in Chapter 12) and swapping animals around 
to minimize sexual contact between related 
animals.

 Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
unique alleles by looking for distinct patterns within genes and certain sec-
tions of junk DNA (see Chapter 18 for how junk DNA conceals genetic 
information).
 
Mutant alleles that show up outside the population they’re usually associated 
with suggest that one or more individuals have moved or dispersed between 
populations. Geneticists use these genetic hints to trace the movements of 
animals, plants, and even people around the world. In the sections that follow, 
I cover some of the latest efforts to do just that.
One big happy family
With the contributions of the Human Genome Project (covered in Chapter 
11), human population geneticists have a treasure trove of information to 
sift through. Using new technologies, researchers are learning more than 
ever before about what makes various human populations distinct. One such 
effort is the HapMap Project. Hap stands for haplotype, which is another way 
of saying an inventory of human alleles. The alleles being studied for the 
HapMap aren’t necessarily alleles from specific genes; many are alleles within 
the junk DNA. The HapMap takes advantage of single base pair changes, 
called SNPs (see Chapter 18), in the DNA; SNPs are the results of thousands 
of substitution mutations. Most of these tiny changes have no effect on phe-
notype, but collectively they vary enough from one population to another to 
allow geneticists to discern each population’s genetic signature.
After geneticists understand how much diversity exists among haplotypes, 
they work to create genetic maps that relate SNP alleles to geographic loca-
tions. Essentially, all humans tend to divide up genetically into the three 
continents of Africa, Asia, and Europe. This isn’t too surprising — humans 
have been in North and South America for only 10,000 years or so. When 
the genetic uniqueness of the Old World’s people was described, geneticists 
examined populations in North America and other immigrant populations to 
see if genetics could predict where people came from. For example, genetic 
analyses of a group of immigrants in Los Angeles accurately determined 
which continent these people originally lived on. Some geneticists believe 
that the genetic maps can be even more specific and may point people to 
countries, and maybe even cities, where their ancestors once lived. The ulti-
mate goal of the HapMap Project is to link haplotypes to populations along 
with information about the environment, family histories, and medical condi-
tions to development tailor-made treatments for diseases.
Because humans love to travel, geneticists have also compared rates of 
movements between men and women. Common wisdom suggests that, histor-
ically, men tended to move around more than women did (think Christopher 

260
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Columbus or Leif Ericson). However, DNA evidence suggests that men aren’t 
as prone to wander as previously believed. Geneticists compared mitochon-
drial DNA (passed from mother to child) with Y chromosome DNA (passed 
from father to son). It seems that women have migrated from one continent 
to another eight times more frequently than males. The tradition of women 
leaving their own families to join their husbands may have contributed to the 
pattern, but another possible explanation exists: A pattern of polygyny, men 
fathering children by more than one woman. So, back to that bit about men 
wandering. . . .
Uncovering the secret social 
lives of animals
Gene flow can have an enormous impact on threatened and endangered spe-
cies. For example, scientists in Scandinavia were studying an isolated popula-
tion of gray wolves not long ago. Genetically, the population was very inbred; 
all the animals descended from the same pair of wolves. Heterozygosity 
was low and, as a consequence, so were birth rates. When the population 
suddenly started to grow, the scientists were shocked. Apparently, a male 
wolf migrated over 500 miles to join the pack and father wolf pups. Just one 
animal brought enough new genes to rescue the population from extinction.
Mating patterns of animals often provide biologists with surprises. Because 
humans like to form monogamous pairs, scientists have compared birds to 
humankind by pointing to our apparently similar mating habits. As it turns 
out, birds aren’t so monogamous after all. In most species of perching birds 
(the group that includes pigeons and sparrows, to name two widespread 
types), 20 percent of all offspring are fathered by some male other than the 
one with whom the female spends all her time. By spreading paternity among 
several males, a female bird makes sure that her offspring are genetically 
diverse. And genetic diversity is incredibly important to help fend off stress 
and disease.
 
Genetics reveals that some birds are really frisky. For example, fairy wrens — 
tiny, brilliant-blue songbirds — live in Australia in big groups; one female is 
attended by several males who help her raise her young. But none of the males 
attending the nest actually fathers any of the kids — female fairy wrens slip off 
to mate with males in distant territories. Other birds form family groups. Florida 
scrub jays — beautiful aquamarine natives of central Florida — stay home 
and help mom and dad raise younger brothers and sisters. Eventually, older 
kids inherit their parents’ territory. Another Australian species, white-winged 
choughs, put a whole different twist on gathering a labor force for raising their 
kids. Chough (pronounced chuff) families kidnap their neighbors’ kids and put 
them to work raising offspring.

261
 Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
It turns out that humans aren’t the only ones who live in close association 
with their parents, brothers, or sisters for their entire lives. Some species of 
whales live in groups called pods. Every pod represents one family: moms, 
sisters, brothers, aunts, and cousins, but not dads. Different pods meet up 
to find mates — as in the son/brother of one pod may mate with the daugh-
ter/sister of another pod. Males father offspring in different pods but stay 
with their own families for their entire lives. Sadly, geneticists learned about 
whale family structures and mating habits by taking meat from whales that 
had been killed by people. Like so many of the world’s creatures, whales are 
killed by hunters. Hopefully, though, the information that scientists gather 
when whales are harvested will contribute to their conservation, allowing the 
planet’s amazing biodiversity to persist for generations to come.
Changing Forms over Time: 
The Genetics of Evolution
Evolution, or how organisms change over time, is a foundational principle of 
biology. When Charles Darwin put forth his observations about natural selec-
tion, the genetic basis for inheritance was unknown. Now, with powerful tools 
like DNA sequencing (which appears in Chapter 8), scientists are document-
ing evolutionary change in real time, as well as uncovering how species share 
ancestors from long ago.
When genetic variation arises (from mutation, which I talk about in Chapter 
13), new alleles are created. Then, natural selection acts to make particular 
genetic variants more common by way of improved survival and reproduc-
tive success for some individuals over others. In this section, you discover 
how genetics and evolution are inextricably tied together.
Genetic variation is key
All evolutionary change occurs because genetic variation arises through 
mutation. Without genetic variation, evolution can’t take place. While many 
mutations are decidedly bad (I discuss those in Chapter 13), some mutations 
confer an advantage, such as resistance to disease.
No matter how a mutation arises or what consequences it causes, the change 
must be heritable, or passed from parent to offspring, to drive evolution. 

262
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Until recently, it wasn’t possible to examine heritable variation directly. 
Instead, phenotypic variation was used as an indicator of how much genetic 
variation might exist. With the help of DNA sequencing, scientists have come 
to realize that genetic variation is vastly more complex than anyone ever 
imagined.
 
Heritable genetic variation alone doesn’t mean that evolution will occur, how-
ever. The final piece in the evolutionary puzzle is natural selection. Put simply, 
natural selection occurs when conditions favor individuals carrying particular 
traits. By favor, it’s meant that those individuals reproduce and survive better 
than other individuals carrying a different set of traits. This success is some-
times referred to as fitness, which is the degree of reproductive success associ-
ated with a particular genotype. When an organism has high fitness, its genes 
are being passed on successfully to the next generation. Through its effects on 
fitness, natural selection produces adaptations, or sets of traits that are impor-
tant for survival. The white fur of polar bears, which allow them to blend into 
the snowy landscape of Arctic regions, is an example of an adaptation.
Where new species come from
Probably since the dawn of time (or at least the dawn of humankind, 
anyhow), humans have been classifying and naming the creatures around 
them. The formalized species naming system, what scientists call taxonomic 
classification, has long relied on physical differences and similarities between 
organisms as a means of sorting things out. For example, elephants from Asia 
and elephants from Africa are obviously both elephants, but they’re so differ-
ent in their physical characteristics, among other things, that they’re consid-
ered separate species. Over the past 50 years or so, the way in which species 
are classified has changed as scientists have gained more genetic information 
about various organisms.
One way of classifying species is the biological species concept, which bases 
its classification on reproductive compatibility. Organisms that can success-
fully reproduce together are considered to be of the same species, and those 
that can’t reproduce together are a different species. This definition leaves a 
lot to be desired, because many closely related organisms can interbreed yet 
are clearly different enough to be separate species.
Another method of classification, one that works a bit better, says that spe-
cies are groups of organisms that maintain unique identities — genetically, 
physically, and geographically — over time and space. A good example of this 
definition of species is dogs and wolves. Both dogs and wolves are in the same 
pigeonhole, so to speak — they’re both in the genus Canis. (Sharing a genus 
name tells you that organisms are quite similar and very closely related.) But 
their species names are different. Dogs are always Canis familiaris, but there are 

263
 Chapter 17: Tracing Human History and the Future of the Planet
many species of wolves, all beginning with Canis but ending with a variety of 
species names to accurately describe how different they are from each other 
(such as gray wolves, Canis lupus, and red wolves, Canis rufus). Genetically, 
dogs and wolves are very distinct, but they aren’t so different that they can’t 
interbreed. Dogs and wolves occasionally mate and produce offspring, but 
left to their own devices, they don’t interbreed.
When populations of organisms become reproductively isolated from each 
other (that is, they no longer interbreed), each population begins to evolve 
independently. Different mutations arise, and with natural selection, the pas-
sage of time leads to the accumulation of different adaptations. In this way, 
after many generations, populations may become different species.
 
A famous example of this sort of evolutionary change comes from the aptly 
named Darwin’s finches, a group of birds found on the Galapagos, a cluster 
of islands off the coast of South America. Genetic studies indicate that all 
Darwin’s finch species are descended from a single ancestral species that 
landed on the islands between two and three million years ago. As islands 
appeared and disappeared because of volcanic activity, the birds moved from 
one island to another and their populations became isolated, allowing evolu-
tionary changes and natural selection to mold each species in different ways. 
Thus, some Darwin’s finch species have huge bills adapted to cracking open 
hard seeds, whereas others have dainty, slender bills for probing crevices to 
catch insects. Figure 17-2 gives you an idea of the diversity and relationships 
among these fascinating finches.

Growing the evolutionary tree
One of the basic concepts behind evolution is that organisms have similari-
ties because they’re related by descent from a common ancestor. Genetics 
and DNA sequencing techniques have allowed scientists to study these 
evolutionary relationships, or phylogenies, among organisms. For example, 
the DNA sequence of a particular gene may be compared across many organ-
isms. If the gene is very similar or unchanged from one species to another, 
the species would be considered more closely related (in an evolutionary 
sense) than species that have accumulated many mutational changes in the 
same gene.
One way to represent the evolutionary relationships is with a tree diagram. 
In a similar fashion to the pedigrees used to study genetics in family relation-
ships (flip to Chapter 12 for pedigree analysis), evolutionary trees like the 
one in Figure 17-2 illustrate the family relationships among species. The trunk 
of an evolutionary tree represents the common ancestor from which all other 
organisms in the tree descended. The branches of the tree show the evolu-
tionary connections between species. In general, shorter branches indicate 
that species are more closely related.

F
orensics pops up in every cop drama and murder mystery on television 
these days, but what is forensics used for in the real world? Generally, 
forensics is thought of as the science used to capture and convict criminals; 
it includes everything from determining the source of carpet fibers and hairs 
to paternity testing. Technically, forensics is the application of scientific 
methods for legal purposes. Thus, forensic genetics is the exploration of DNA 
evidence — who is it, who did it, and who’s your daddy.
Just as each person has his or her own unique fingerprint, every human (with 
the exception of identical twins) is genetically unique. DNA fingerprinting, also 
known as DNA profiling, is the process of uncovering the patterns within DNA. 
DNA fingerprinting is at the heart of forensic genetics and is often used to
 
✓ Confirm that a person was present at a particular location
 
✓ Determine identity (including gender)
 
✓ Assign paternity
In this chapter, you step inside the DNA lab to discover how scientists solve 
forensic mysteries by identifying individuals and family relationships using 
genetics.
 
The knowledge that every human’s fingerprints are unique is probably as old 
as humanity itself. But Edward Henry was the first police officer to apply the 
patterns of loops, arches, and whorls from people’s fingertips to identify indi-
vidual people and match criminal to crime way back in 1899.

Rooting through Your Junk 
DNA to Find Your Identity
It’s obvious just from looking at the people around you that each one of us 
is unique. But getting at the genotype (genetic traits) behind the phenotype 
(physical traits) is tricky business, because almost all your DNA is exactly 
like every other human’s DNA. Much of what your DNA does is provide the 
information to run all your body functions, and most of those functions 
are exactly the same from one human to another. If you were to compare 
your roughly 3 billion base pairs of DNA (see Chapter 6 for how DNA is put 
together) with your next-door neighbor’s DNA, you’d find that 99.999 percent 
of your DNA is exactly the same.
So what makes you look so different from the guy next door, or even from 
your mom and dad? Your genetic uniqueness is the result of sexual repro-
duction. (For more on how sexual reproduction works to make you unique, 
turn to Chapter 2.) Until the human genome was sequenced (see Chapter 8), 
the tiny differences produced by recombination and meiosis that make you 
genetically unique were very hard to isolate. But in 1985, a team of scientists 
in Britain figured out how to profile a tiny bit of DNA uniqueness into a DNA 
fingerprint. Surprisingly, DNA fingerprinting doesn’t use the information con-
tained in your genes that make you look unique. Instead, the process takes 
advantage of part of the genome that doesn’t seem to do anything at all: 
junk DNA.
 
Less than 2 percent of the human genome codes for actual physical traits — 
that is, all your body parts and the ways they function. That’s pretty astound-
ing considering that your genome is so huge. So what’s all that extra DNA 
doing in there? Scientists are still trying to figure that part out, but what they 
do know is that some junk DNA is very useful for identifying individual people.
Even within junk DNA, one human looks much like another. But short 
stretches of junk DNA vary a lot from person to person. Short tandem repeats 
(STRs) are sections of DNA arranged in back-to-back repetition (a simple 
sequence is repeated several times in a row). A naturally occurring junk 
DNA sequence may look something like the following example. (The spaces 
in these examples allow you to read the sequences more easily. Real DNA 
doesn’t have spaces between the bases.)
TGCT AGTC AAAG TCTT CGGT TCAT
A short STR may look like this:
TCAT TCAT TCAT TCAT TCAT TCAT

267
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
The number of repeats in pairs of STRs varies from one person to another. 
The variations are referred to as alleles (see Chapter 3 for more about 
alleles). Using two chromosome pairs from different suspects, Figure 18-1 
shows how the same STRs can have different alleles. Chromosome 1 has 
two loci (in reality, this chromosome may have hundreds of loci, but we’re 
only looking at two in this example). For the first suspect, the marker at STR 
Locus A is the same length on both chromosomes, meaning that Suspect One 
is homozygous for Locus A (homozygous means the two alleles at a particular 
locus are identical). At Locus B, Suspect One (S1) has alleles that are differ-
ent lengths, meaning he’s heterozygous at that locus (heterozygous means 
the two alleles differ). Now look at the STR DNA profile of Suspect Two (S2). 
It shows the same two loci, but the patterns are different. At Locus A, S2 is 
heterozygous and has one allele that’s different from S1’s. At Locus B, S2 is 
homozygous for a completely different allele than the ones S1 carries.

The variation in STR alleles is called polymorphism (poly- meaning “many” and 
morph- meaning “shape or type”). Polymorphism arises from mistakes made 
during the DNA copying process (called replication; see Chapter 7). Normally, 
DNA is copied mistake-free during replication. But when the enzyme copying 
the DNA reaches an STR, it often gets confused by all the repeats and winds 
up leaving out one repeat — like one of the TCATs in the previous example — 
or putting an extra one in by mistake. As a result, the sequences of DNA before 
and after the STR are exactly the same from one person to the next, but the 
number of repeats within the STR varies. In the case of junk DNA, the muta-
tions in the STRs create lots of variation in how many repeats appear (varia-
tions, or mutations, in genes can produce harmful and severe consequences; 
see Chapter 13 for details).
The specific STRs used in forensics are referred to as loci or markers. Loci is 
the plural form of locus, which is Latin for “place.” (Genes are also referred 
to as loci; see Chapter 3.) You have hundreds of STR markers on every one of 
your chromosomes. These loci are named using numbers and letters, such as 
D5S818 or VWA.

268
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
 
Your STR DNA fingerprint is completely different from everyone else’s on earth 
(except your identical twin, if you have one). The probability of anyone else 
having identical alleles as you at every one of his or her loci is outrageously small.
Lots of other organisms have STR DNA and, in turn, their own DNA finger-
prints. Dogs, cats, horses, fish, plants — in fact, just about all eukaryotes 
have lots of STR DNA. (Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells have nuclei.) 
That makes STR DNA fingerprinting an extremely powerful tool to answer all 
kinds of biological questions. (See Chapter 17 for more about how DNA fin-
gerprinting is used to solve other kinds of biological mysteries.)
Investigating the Scene: 
Where’s the DNA?
When a crime occurs, the forensic geneticist and the crime scene investigator 
are interested in the biological evidence, because cells in biological evidence 
contain DNA. Biological evidence includes blood, saliva, semen, and hair.
Pets and plants play detective
DNA evidence from almost any source may 
provide a link between criminal and crime. For 
example, a particularly brutal murder in Seattle 
was solved entirely on the basis of DNA provided 
by the victim’s dog. After two people and their 
dog were shot in their home, two suspects were 
arrested in the case, and blood-spattered cloth-
ing was found in their possession. The only blood 
on the clothing was of canine origin, and the 
dog’s blood turned out to be the only evidence 
linking the suspects to the crime scene. Using 
markers originally designed for canine paternity 
analysis, investigators generated a DNA finger-
print from the dog’s blood and compared it with 
DNA tests from the bloodstained clothing. A per-
fect match resulted in a conviction.
Practically any sort of biological material can 
provide enough DNA to match a suspect to a 
crime. In one murder case, the perpetrator 
stepped in a pile of dog feces near the scene. 
DNA fingerprinting matched the evidence on a 
suspect’s shoe to the evidence at the scene, 
leading to a conviction. In another case, a rape 
victim’s dog urinated on the attacker’s vehicle, 
allowing investigators to match the pup to the 
truck; the suspect promptly confessed his guilt.
Even plants have a space in the DNA evidence 
game. The very first time DNA evidence from 
plants was used was in an Arizona court case 
in 1992. A murder victim was found near a 
desert tree called Paloverde. Seeds from that 
type of tree were found in the bed of a pickup 
truck that belonged to a suspect in the case, 
but the suspect denied ever having been in the 
area. The seeds in the truck were matched to 
the exact tree where the victim was found using 
DNA fingerprinting. The seeds couldn’t prove 
the suspect’s presence, but they provided a link 
between his truck and the tree where the body 
was found. The DNA evidence was convincing 
enough to obtain a conviction in the case.

269
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
Collecting biological evidence
Anything that started out as part of a living thing may provide useful DNA 
for analysis. In addition to human biological evidence (blood, saliva, semen, 
and hair), plant parts like seeds, leaves, and pollen, as well as hair and blood 
from pets, can help link a suspect and victim. (See the sidebar “Pets and 
plants play detective” for more on how nonhuman DNA is used to investigate 
crimes.)
To properly collect evidence for DNA testing, the investigator must be very, 
very careful, because his or her own DNA can get mixed up with DNA from 
the scene. Investigators wear gloves, avoid sneezing and coughing, and cover 
their hair (I’m not kidding — dandruff has DNA, too).
To conduct a thorough investigation, the investigator needs to collect 
everything at the scene (or from the suspect) that may provide evidence. 
DNA has been gathered from bones, teeth, hair, urine, feces, chewing gum, 
cigarette butts, toothbrushes, and even earwax! Blood is the most powerful 
evidence because even the tiniest drop of blood contains about 80,000 white 
blood cells, and the nucleus of every white blood cell contains a copy of the 
donor’s entire genome and more than enough information to determine iden-
tity using a DNA fingerprint. But even one skin cell has enough DNA to make a 
fingerprint (see “Outlining the powerful PCR process”). That means that skin 
cells clinging to a cigarette butt or an envelope flap may provide the evidence 
needed to place a suspect at the scene.
To draw information and conclusions from the DNA evidence, the investigator 
needs to collect samples from the victim or victims, suspects, and witnesses 
for comparison. Investigators collect samples from houseplants, pets, or other 
living things nearby to compare those DNA fingerprints to the DNA evidence. 
After the investigator gets these samples, it’s time to head to the lab.
Decomposing DNA
DNA, like all biological molecules, can decom-
pose; that process is called degradation. 
Exonucleases, a particular class of enzymes 
whose sole function is to carry out the process 
of DNA degradation, are practically every-
where: on your skin, on the surfaces you touch, 
and in bacteria. Anytime DNA is exposed to 
exonuclease attack, its quality rapidly dete-
riorates because the DNA molecule starts to 
get broken into smaller and smaller pieces. 
Degradation is bad news for evidence because 
DNA begins to degrade as soon as cells (like 
skin or blood) are separated from the living 
organism. To prevent DNA evidence from fur-
ther degradation after it’s collected, it’s stored 
in a sterile (that is, bacteria-free) container and 
kept dry. As long as the sample isn’t exposed 
to high temperatures, moisture, or strong light, 
DNA evidence can remain usable for more than 
100 years. (Even under adverse conditions, DNA 
can sometimes last for centuries, as I explain in 
Chapter 6.)

270
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Moving to the lab
Biological samples contain lots of substances besides DNA. Therefore, when 
an investigator gets evidence to the lab, the first thing to do is extract the 
DNA from the sample. (For a DNA extraction experiment using a strawberry, 
see Chapter 6.) There are different methods to extract DNA, but they gener-
ally follow these three basic steps:
 
1. Break open the cells to free the DNA from the nucleus (this is called cell 
lysis).
 
2. Remove the proteins (which make up most of the biological sample) by 
digesting them with an enzyme.
 
3. Remove the DNA from the solution by adding alcohol.
After the DNA from the sample is isolated, it’s analyzed using a process 
called the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR.
Outlining the powerful PCR process
The goal of the PCR process is to make thousands of copies of specific parts 
of the DNA molecule — in the case of forensic genetics, several target STR 
loci that are used to construct a DNA fingerprint. (Copying the entire DNA 
molecule would be useless because the uniqueness of each individual person 
is hidden among all that DNA.) Many copies of several target sequences are 
necessary, for two reasons:
 
✓ Current technology used in DNA fingerprinting can’t detect the DNA 
unless large amounts are present, and to get large amounts of DNA, you 
have to make copies.
 
✓ Matches must be exact when it comes to DNA fingerprinting and foren-
sic genetics; after all, people’s lives are on the line. To avoid misidentifi-
cations, many STR loci from each sample must be examined.
In the U.S., 13 standard markers are used for matching human samples, 
plus one additional marker that allows determination of gender (that is, 
whether the sample came from a male or a female). These markers are part 
of CODIS, the COmbined DNA Index System, which is the U.S. database of 
DNA fingerprints.
Here’s how PCR works, as shown in Figure 18-2:
 
1. To replicate DNA using PCR, you have to separate the double-stranded 
DNA molecule (called the template) into single strands. This process 
is called denaturing. When DNA is double-stranded, the bases are 

271
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
protected by the phosphate sugar backbone of the double helix (see 
Chapter 6). DNA’s complementary bases, where all the information is 
stored, are locked away, so to speak. To pick the lock, get at the code, 
and build a DNA copy, the double helix must be opened up. The hydro-
gen bonds that hold the two DNA strands together are very strong, but 
they can be broken by heating the molecule up to a temperature just 
short of boiling (212 degrees Fahrenheit). When heated, the two strands 
slowly come apart as the hydrogen bonds melt. DNA’s sugar-phosphate 
backbone isn’t damaged by heat, so the single strands stay together 
with the bases still in their original order.
 
2. When denaturing is complete, the mix is cooled slightly. Cooling allows 
small, complementary pieces of DNA called primers to attach themselves 
to the template DNA. The primers match up with their complements on 
the template strands in a process called annealing. Primers only attach 
to the template strand when the match is perfect; if no exact match is 
found, the next step in the PCR process doesn’t occur because prim-
ers are required to start the copying process (see Chapter 7 for more 
on why primers are necessary to build strands of DNA from scratch). 
The primers used in PCR are marked with dyes that glow when exposed 
to the right wavelength of light (think fluorescent paint under a black 
light). STRs of similar length (even though they may actually be on 
entirely different chromosomes, as in Figure 18-1) are labeled with dif-
ferent colors so that when the fingerprint is read, each locus shows up 
as a different color (see “Constructing the DNA fingerprint” later in this 
chapter).

3. After the primers find their matches on the template strands, Taq poly-
merase begins to do its work. Polymerases act to put things together. In 
this case, the thing getting put together is a DNA molecule.

272
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
 
 Taq polymerase starts adding bases — this stage is called extension — 
onto the 3’ ends of the primers by reading the template DNA strand to 
determine which base belongs next (see Chapter 6 for details on DNA 
strands’ numbered ends). Meanwhile, on the opposite template strand 
at the end of the reverse primer, Taq rapidly adds complementary 
bases using the template as a guide. (The newly replicated DNA remains 
double-stranded throughout this process because the mixture isn’t hot 
enough to melt the newly formed hydrogen bonds between the comple-
mentary bases.)
One complete round of PCR produces two identical copies of the desired 
STR. But two copies aren’t enough to be detected by the lasers used to read 
the DNA fingerprints (see “Constructing the DNA fingerprint”). You need hun-
dreds of thousands of copies of each STR, so the PCR process — denaturing, 
annealing, and extending — repeats over and over.
Figure 18-3 shows you how fast this copying reaction adds up — after 5 cycles, 
you have 32 copies of the STR. Typically, a PCR reaction is repeated for 30 
cycles, so with just one template strand of DNA, you end up with 1,073,741,824 
copies of the target STR (the primers and the sequence between them). 
Usually, evidence samples consist of more than one cell, so it’s likely that you 
start with 80,000 or so template strands instead of just one. With 30 rounds of 
PCR, this would yield . . . I’ll wait while you do the math . . . okay, so it’s a lot of 
DNA, as in trillions of copies of the target STR. That’s the power of PCR. Even 
the tiniest drop of blood or a single hair can yield a fingerprint that may free 
the innocent or convict the guilty.
 
The invention of PCR revolutionized the study of DNA. Basically, PCR is like a 
copier for DNA but with one big difference: A photocopier makes facsimiles; 
PCR makes real DNA. Before PCR came along, scientists needed large amounts 
of DNA directly from the evidence to make a DNA fingerprint. But DNA evi-
dence is often found and collected in very tiny amounts. Often, the evidence 
that links a criminal to a crime scene is the DNA contained in a single hair! One 
of the biggest advantages to PCR is that a very tiny amount of DNA — even 
one cell’s worth! — can be used to generate many exact copies of the STRs 
used to create a DNA fingerprint (see the section “Rooting through Your Junk 
DNA to Find Your Identity” earlier in this chapter for a full explanation of STR). 
Chapter 22 looks at the discovery of PCR in more detail.
Constructing the DNA fingerprint
For each DNA sample taken as forensic evidence and put through the process 
of PCR, several loci are examined. (“Several” often means 13 because of the 
CODIS database; see the earlier “Outlining the powerful PCR process” sec-
tion.) This study yields a unique pattern of colors and sizes of STRs — this is 
the DNA fingerprint of the individual from whom the sample came.

DNA fingerprints are “read” using a process called electrophoresis, which 
takes advantage of the fact that DNA is negatively charged. An electrical 
current is passed through a jelly-like substance (such as a gel), and the com-
pleted PCR is injected into the gel. By electrical attraction, the DNA moves 
toward the positive pole (electrophoresis). Small STR fragments move faster 
than larger ones, so the STRs sort themselves according to size (see Figure 
18-4). Because the fragments are tagged with dye, a computer-driven machine 
with a laser is used to “see” the fragments by their colors. The STR fragments 
show up as peaks like those shown in Figure 18-4. The results are stored in 
the computer for later analysis of the resulting pattern.
The technology used in DNA fingerprinting now allows the entire process, 
from extracting the DNA to reading the fingerprint, to be done very rapidly. 
If everything goes right, it takes less than 24 hours to generate one complete 
DNA fingerprint.
 
The first cases to use DNA fingerprinting appeared in the courts in 1986. 
Generally, legal evidence must adhere to what experts call the Frye standard. 
Frye is short for Frye v. United States, a court case decided in 1923. Put simply, 
Frye says that scientific evidence can only be used when most scientists 
agree that the methods and theory used to generate the evidence are well 
established. Following its development, DNA fingerprinting rapidly gained 
acceptance by the courts, and it’s now considered routine. The tests used to 
generate DNA fingerprints have changed over the years, and STRs are now the 
gold standard.

Employing DNA to Catch Criminals 
(And Free the Innocent)
After the forensic geneticist generates DNA fingerprints from different sam-
ples, the next step is to compare the results. When it comes to getting the 
most information out of the fingerprints, the basic idea is to look for matches 
between the
 
✓ Suspect’s DNA and DNA on the victim, the victim’s clothing or posses-
sions, or the location where the victim was known to have been.
 
✓ Victim’s DNA and DNA on the suspect’s body, clothing, or other posses-
sions, or a location linked to the suspect.

275
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
Matching the evidence to the bad guy
In Figure 18-4, you can see that exact matches of DNA fingerprints stand out 
like a sore thumb. But when you find a match between a suspect and your 
evidence, how do you know that no one else shares the same DNA fingerprint 
as that particular suspect?
With DNA fingerprints, you can’t know for sure that a suspect is the culprit 
you’re looking for, but you can calculate the odds of another person having 
the same pattern. Because this book isn’t Statistical Genetics For Dummies, I’ll 
skip the details of exactly how to calculate these odds. Instead, I’ll just tell 
you that, in Figure 18-4, the odds of another person having the same pattern 
as Suspect Two is 1 in 45 for locus one, 1 in 70 for locus two, and 1 in 50 for 
locus three. To calculate the total odds of a match, you multiply the three 
probabilities: 1⁄45 × 1⁄70 × 1⁄50 = 1⁄157,500. Based on your test using just three loci, the 
probability of another person having the same DNA pattern as Suspect Two 
is 1 in 157,500.
 
When all 13 CODIS loci are used, the odds of finding two unrelated persons 
with the same DNA fingerprints are 1 in 53,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that’s 53 
quintillion for those of you scoring at home). To put this figure in perspective, 
consider that the planet has only 6 billion people. To say the least, your life-
time odds of getting hit by lightning (1 in 3,000) are a lot better than this!
Of course, real life is a lot more complicated than the example in Figure 18-4. 
Biological evidence samples are often mixed and contain more than one 
person’s DNA. Because humans are diploid (having chromosomes in pairs; 
see Chapter 2), mixed samples (called admixtures for you CSI fans) are easy 
to spot — they have three or more alleles in a single locus. By comparing 
samples, forensic geneticists can parse out whose DNA is whose and even 
determine how much DNA in a sample was contributed by each person.
But what if the evidence and the suspect’s DNA don’t match? The good news 
is that an innocent person is off the hook. The bad news is that the guilty 
party is still roaming free. At this point, investigators turn back to the CODIS 
system because it was designed not only to standardize which loci get used 
in DNA fingerprinting but also to provide a library of DNA fingerprints to 
help identify criminals and solve crimes. The FBI established the DNA finger-
print database in 1998 based on the fact that repeat offenders commit most 
crimes. When a person is convicted of a crime (laws vary on which convic-
tions require DNA sampling; see the sidebar “To find a criminal using DNA”), 
his or her DNA is sampled — often by using a cotton swab to collect a few 
skin cells from the inside of the mouth. As of early 2010, the CODIS database 
had provided over 101,000 matches and assisted in over 100,000 investiga-
tions. If no match is found in CODIS, the evidence is added to the database. If 
the perpetrator is ever found, then a match can be made to other crimes he 
or she may have committed.

276
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Taking a second look at guilty verdicts
Not all persons convicted of crimes are guilty. One study estimates that 
roughly 7,500 persons are wrongfully convicted each year in the U.S. alone. 
The reasons behind wrongful conviction are varied, but the fact remains that 
innocent persons shouldn’t be jailed for crimes they didn’t commit.
In 1992, Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld founded the Innocence Project in an 
effort to exonerate innocent men and women. The project relies on DNA evi-
dence, and services are free of charge to all who qualify.
 
Walter D. Smith is one of the 249 persons in the U.S. exonerated by DNA evi-
dence as of January 2010. In 1985, Smith was wrongfully accused of raping 
three women. Despite his claims of innocence, eyewitness testimony brought 
about a conviction, and Smith received a sentence of 78 to 190 years in prison. 
During his 11 years of incarceration, Smith earned a degree in business and 
conquered drug addiction. In 1996, the Innocence Project conducted DNA test-
ing that ultimately proved his innocence and set him free.
To find a criminal using DNA
The FBI’s CODIS system works because it con-
tains hundreds of thousands of cataloged sam-
ples for comparison. All 50 U.S. states require 
DNA samples to be collected from persons con-
victed of sex offenses and murder. Laws vary 
from state to state on which other convictions 
require DNA sampling, but so far, CODIS has 
cataloged over 300,000 offender samples, with 
at least that many more awaiting analysis. But 
what if no sample has been collected from the 
guilty party? What happens then?
Some law enforcement agencies have con-
ducted mass collection efforts to obtain DNA 
samples for comparison. The most famous 
of these collection efforts occurred in Great 
Britain in the mid-1980s. After two teenaged 
girls were murdered, every male in the entire 
neighborhood around the crime scene was 
asked to donate a sample for comparison. In 
all, nearly 4,000 men complied with the request 
to donate their DNA. The actual murderer was 
captured after he bragged about how he had 
gotten someone else to volunteer a sample 
for him.
DNA evidence is also sometimes used to 
extend the statute of limitations on crimes when 
no arrest has been made. (The statute of limi-
tations is the amount of time prosecutors have 
to bring charges against a suspect.) Crimes 
involving murder have no statute of limitations, 
but most states have a statute of limitations on 
other crimes such as rape. To allow prosecu-
tion of such crimes, DNA evidence can be used 
to file an arrest warrant or make an indictment 
against “John Doe” — the unknown person 
possessing the DNA fingerprint of the perpe-
trator. The arrest warrant extends the statute 
of limitations indefinitely until a suspect is 
captured.

277
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
It’s unclear how many criminal cases have been subjected to postconvic-
tion DNA testing, and the success rates for such cases are unreported. 
Surprisingly, many states have opposed postconviction testing, but laws are 
being passed to allow or require such testing when circumstances warrant it.
It’s All Relative: Finding Family
Family relationships are important in forensic genetics when it comes to 
paternity for court cases or determining the identities of persons killed in 
mass disasters. Individuals who are related to one another have copies of 
their DNA in common because each parent passes on half of his or her chro-
mosomes to each offspring (see Chapter 5). Within a family tree, the amount 
of genetic relatedness, or kinship, among individuals is very predictable. 
Assuming that Mom and Dad are unrelated to each other, full siblings have 
roughly half their DNA in common because they each inherit all their DNA 
from the same parents.
Paternity testing
Surprisingly (or maybe not, depending on how many daytime talk shows you 
watch), roughly 15 percent of children are fathered by someone other than 
the father listed on the birth certificate. Therefore, tests to determine what 
male fathered what child are of considerable interest. Paternity testing is 
used in divorce and custody cases, determination of rightful inheritance, and 
a variety of other legal and social situations.
Paternity testing using STR techniques has become very common and rela-
tively (pardon the pun) inexpensive. The methods are exactly the same as 
those used in evidence testing (see the earlier section “Outlining the pow-
erful PCR process”). The only difference is the way the matches are inter-
preted. Because the STR alleles are on chromosomes (see the earlier section 
“Rooting through Your Junk DNA to Find Your Identity”), a mother contrib-
utes half the STR alleles possessed by a child, and the father contributes the 
other half. Figure 18-5 shows what these contributions may look like in a DNA 
fingerprint. (M is the mother, C is the child, and F1 and F2 are the possible 
fathers.) Alleles are depicted here as peaks, and arrows indicate the maternal 
alleles. Assuming that mother and father are unrelated, half the child’s alleles 
came from F2, indicating that F2 is likely the father.

Two values are often reported in paternity tests conducted with DNA 
fingerprinting:
 
✓ Paternity index: A value that indicates the weight of the evidence. The 
higher the paternity index value, the more likely it is that the alleged 
father is the actual genetic father. The paternity index is a more accu-
rate estimate than probability of paternity.
 
✓ Probability of paternity: The probability that a particular person could 
have contributed the same pattern shown by the DNA fingerprint. The 
odds calculations for probability of paternity are more complicated than 

279
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
multiplying simple probabilities (see “Matching the evidence to the bad 
guy”) because an individual who’s heterozygous at a particular locus 
has an equal probability of contributing either allele. The probability of 
a particular male being the father also depends on how often the vari-
ous alleles at a locus show up in the population at large (which is also 
true for the estimates of odds shown in “Matching the evidence to the 
bad guy”; see Chapter 17 for the lowdown on how population genetics 
works).
 
The results of paternity tests are often expressed in terms of “proof” of pater-
nity or lack thereof. Unfortunately, this terminology is inaccurate. Genetic 
paternity testing doesn’t prove anything. It only indicates a high likelihood 
that a given interpretation of the data is correct.
Thomas Jefferson’s son
Male children receive their one and only Y 
chromosome from their fathers (see Chapter 
5). Thus, paternity of male children can be 
resolved by using DNA markers on the Y chro-
mosome. The discovery of this testing option 
led to the unusual resolution of a long-term 
mystery involving the second U.S. president, 
Thomas Jefferson.
In 1802, Jefferson was accused of father-
ing a son by one of his slaves, Sally Hemings. 
Jefferson’s only acknowledged offspring to 
survive into adulthood were daughters, but 
Jefferson’s paternal uncle has surviving male 
relatives who are descended in an unbroken 
male line. Thus, the Y chromosome DNA from 
these Jefferson family members was expected 
to be essentially identical to the Y chromosome 
DNA that Jefferson inherited from his paternal 
grandfather — DNA he would have contributed 
to a son. Five men known to have descended 
from Jefferson’s uncle agreed to contribute 
DNA samples for comparison with the only 
remaining male descendant of Sally Hemings’s 
youngest son. In all, 19 samples were examined. 
These samples included descendants of other 
potential fathers along with unrelated persons 
for comparison. A total of 19 markers found 
only on the Y chromosome were used. (None 
of the CODIS markers is on the Y chromosome; 
they’d be useless for females if they were.) The 
Jefferson and Hemings descendants matched 
at all 19 markers. Since the publication of the 
genetic analysis, historical records have been 
examined to provide additional evidence that 
Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings’s son, Eston. 
For example, Jefferson was the only male of 
his family present at the time Eston was con-
ceived. Interestingly, examination of the histori-
cal records seems to indicate that Jefferson is 
likely the father of all of Sally Hemings’s six 
children; however, this conclusion remains 
controversial.

Relatedness testing
Paternity analysis isn’t the only time that DNA fingerprinting is used to 
determine family relationships. Historical investigations (like the Jefferson-
Hemings case I explain in the sidebar “Thomas Jefferson’s son”) may also use 
patterns inherited within the DNA to show how closely related people are 
and to identify remains. Mass fatality incidents such as plane crashes and the 
World Trade Center disaster of September 11, 2001, rely on DNA technologies 
to identify deceased persons. Several methods are used under such circum-
stances, including STR DNA fingerprinting, mitochondrial DNA analysis (see 
Chapter 6 for the details on mitochondrial DNA), and Y-chromosome analysis 
(similar to the method I describe in the sidebar “Thomas Jefferson’s son”).
Several conditions complicate DNA identification of victims of mass fatality 
incidents. Bodies are often badly mutilated and fragmented, and decompo-
sition damages what DNA remains in the tissues. Furthermore, reference 
samples of the deceased person’s DNA often don’t exist, making it necessary 
to make inferences from persons closely related to the deceased.
Reconstructing individual genotypes
Much of what forensic geneticists know about identifying victims of mass 
fatalities comes from airplane crashes. In 1998, Swissair Flight 111 crashed 
into the Atlantic Ocean just off the coast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This 
disaster sparked an unusually comprehensive DNA typing effort that now 
serves as the model for forensic scientists the world over dealing with similar 
cases.
 
In all, 1,200 samples from 229 persons were recovered from Swissair Flight 
111. Only one body could be identified by appearance alone, so investiga-
tors obtained 397 reference samples either from personal items belonging 
to victims (like toothbrushes) or from family members. Because most refer-
ence samples from the victims themselves were lost in the crash, 93 percent 
of identifications depended on samples from parents, children, and siblings 
of the deceased. The number of alleles shared by family members is fairly 
predictable, allowing investigators to conduct parentage analysis based on 
the expected rate of matching alleles. In the Swissair case, 43 family groups 
(including 6 families of both parents and some or all of their children) were 
among the victims, so the analyses were complicated by kinship among the 
victims.
The initial DNA fingerprinting of remains revealed 228 unique genotypes 
(including one pair of twins). The 13 CODIS loci were tested using PCR (the 
methods were identical to those I describe in the earlier section “Employing 
DNA to Catch Criminals (And Free the Innocent)”). All the data from DNA 

281
 Chapter 18: Solving Mysteries Using DNA
fingerprinting was entered into a computer program specifically designed to 
compare large numbers of DNA fingerprints. The program searched for sev-
eral kinds of matches:
 
✓ A perfect match between a victim and a reference sample from a per-
sonal item
 
✓ Matches between victims that would identify family groups (parents and 
children, and siblings)
 
✓ Matches between samples from living family members
The computer then generated reports for all matches within given samples. 
Two investigators independently reviewed every report and only declared 
identifications when the probability of a correct identification was greater 
than a million to one. Altogether, over 180,000 comparisons were made to 
determine the identities of the 229 victims.
Forty-seven persons were identified based on matches with personal items. 
The remaining 182 persons were identified by comparing victims’ genotypes 
with those of living family members. The power of PCR, combined with many 
loci and computer software, led to rapid comparisons and the positive identi-
fication of all the victims.
Bringing closure in times of tragedy
 
On September 11, 2001, two jetliners crashed into the twin towers of the 
World Trade Center in New York City. The enormous fires resulting from the 
crashes caused both buildings to collapse. Roughly 2,700 persons died in the 
disaster. Over 20,000 body parts were recovered from the rubble; therefore, 
the task of forensic geneticists was two-fold: determine the identity of each 
deceased person and collect the remains of particular individuals for inter-
ment. Unlike Swissair Flight 111, few victims of the WTC tragedy were related 
to each other. However, other issues complicated the task of identifying the 
victims. Many bodies were subjected to extreme heat, and others were recov-
ered weeks after the disaster, as rubble was removed. Thus, many victim 
samples had very little remaining DNA for analysis.
DNA reference samples from missing persons were collected from personal 
effects such as toothbrushes, razors, and hairbrushes. Skin cells clinging 
to toothbrushes accounted for almost 80 percent of the reference samples 
obtained for comparison. These samples were DNA fingerprinted using 
PCR with the standard 13 CODIS loci I describe in “Employing DNA to Catch 
Criminals (And Free the Innocent)” earlier in this chapter. By July 2002, 
roughly 300 identifications were made using these direct reference samples. 
An additional 200 identifications were made by comparing victim samples to 

282
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
samples from living relatives using the methods I describe for the Swissair 
crash (see “Reconstructing individual genotypes”).
By July 2004, a total of 1,500 victims had been positively identified, but sub-
sequent progress was slow. The remaining samples were so damaged that 
the DNA was in very short pieces, too short to support STR analysis. Two 
avenues for additional identifications remained:
 
✓ Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is useful for two reasons:
 
• It’s multicopy DNA, meaning that each cell has many mitochondria, 
and each mitochondrion has its own molecule of mtDNA.
 
• It’s circular, making it somewhat more resistant to decomposition 
because the nucleases that destroy DNA often start at the end of 
the molecule (see “Collecting biological evidence” earlier), and a 
circle has no end, so to speak.
 
 mtDNA is inherited directly from mother to child; therefore, only mater-
nal relatives can provide matching DNA. Unlike STR markers, mtDNA is 
usually analyzed by comparing the sequences of nucleotides from vari-
ous samples (see Chapter 11 to find out how DNA sequences are gener-
ated and analyzed). Because sequence comparison is more complicated 
than STR marker comparison, the analyses take longer to perform but 
provide very accurate matches.
 
✓ Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP analysis) (pronounced snip), 
which relies on the fact that DNA tolerates some kinds of mutation 
without harming the organism (see Chapter 13 for more about muta-
tion). SNPs occur when one base replaces another in what’s called a 
point mutation. Generally, T replaces A and G replaces C or vice versa 
(see Chapter 6 for more about the bases that make up DNA). These tiny 
changes occur often (some estimates are as high as about one in every 
100 bases), and when many SNPs are compared, the changes can create 
a unique DNA profile similar to a DNA fingerprint.
 
 The downside to SNP analysis is that the point mutations don’t create 
obvious size differences that traditional DNA fingerprinting can detect. 
Therefore, sequencing or gene chips (see Chapter 23 for more on gene 
chips) must be used to detect the SNP profile of various individuals. 
Because SNP analysis can be conducted on very small fragments of DNA, 
it allowed investigators to make more identifications than were possible 
otherwise. Even so, many persons were not identified, and identification 
efforts were halted in February 2005.

Genes into Plants and Animals

▶ Tracing the development of genetically modified organisms
▶ Understanding how transgenics works
▶ Weighing the pros and cons of genetic modification
O
ne of the most controversial applications of genetics technology 
(besides cloning, which I cover in Chapter 20) is the mechanical trans-
fer of genes from one organism to another. This process is popularly known 
as genetic modification (GM). More properly called transgenics, transferring 
genes simplifies the production of some medications, creates herbicide-
resistant plants, and has even been used to create glow-in-the-dark pets (I’m 
not kidding — check out the sidebar “Transgenic pets: Not all fun and games” 
for the details). In this chapter, you discover how scientists move DNA 
around to endow plants, animals, bacteria, and insects with new combina-
tions of genes and traits.
Genetically Modified Organisms 
Are Everywhere
 
News items about genetically modified this, that, and the other crop up prac-
tically every day, and most of this news seems to revolve around protests, 
bans, and lawsuits. Despite all the brouhaha, genetically modified “stuff” is 
neither rare nor wholly dangerous. In fact, most processed foods that you eat 
are likely to contain one or more transgenic ingredients.

284
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
If that revelation worries you, go to your local health food store and peer 
at the labels on organic (and some nonorganic) foods. (Organic foods are 
generally defined as those produced without chemicals such as insecticides, 
herbicides, or artificial ingredients.) You’ll see proclamations of “No GMO,” 
which is meant to reassure you that no transgenes — genes that have been 
artificially introduced using recombinant DNA methods (described in Chapter 
16) — were present in the plants or animals used to make the product in 
question.
In truth, you can’t avoid genetically modified organisms in your everyday 
life. Genetic modification by humans, via artificial selection and, on occasion, 
induced mutation, created every single domesticated plant and animal 
species on earth. Furthermore, the ability to move genes from one species 
to another isn’t new — viruses and bacteria do it all the time. It’s a bit of 
a mystery as to why transgenesis is less acceptable than induced mutagen-
esis and artificial selection, but no matter what you call it, it’s all genetic 
modification.
 
The acronyms GM (genetically modified) and GMO (genetically modified 
organism) are used all the time, but not in this chapter. Instead, I refer specifi-
cally to transgenic organisms because humans have been genetically modifying 
organisms in a variety of ways for a long time.
Making modifications down on the farm
Humans started domesticating plants and animals many centuries ago (take 
a look at the sidebar “Amazing maize” for how corn made the transition from 
grass to gracing your table). Historically, farmers preferentially grew certain 
types of plants to increase the frequency of desirable traits, such as sweeter 
grapes and more kernels per stalk of wheat. Many, if not all, of the cereal 
grains humans depend on, such as wheat, rice, and barley, are the result of 
selective hybridization events that created polyploids (multiple chromosome 
sets; see Chapter 15). When plants become polyploid, their fruits get substan-
tially larger. Fruits from polyploids are more commercially valuable. (They’re 
also better tasting. Try a wild strawberry if you’re not convinced.)
When it comes to animals, humans purposefully inbreed various animals to 
increase the prevalence of traits such as high milk production in cows or 
retrieving ability (make that obsession) in certain breeds of dogs. (Inbreeding 
can also cause substantial problems; see Chapters 13 and 17 for details.)

285
 Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
Relying on radiation and chemicals
In addition to domestication and selective breeding, humans have taken 
another path to genetically modify organisms. For over 70 years, new plant 
breeds have been created by purposefully induced, albeit random, muta-
tions. In essence, plants are exposed to radiation (such as X-rays, gamma 
Amazing maize
Plants depend on a variety of helpers to spread 
their seeds around: The wind, birds, animals, 
and waterways all carry seeds from one place 
to another. Most plants get along just fine with-
out humans. Not so with corn. Corn depends 
entirely on humans to spread its seeds; 
archeological evidence confirms that corn 
has traveled only where humans have taken it. 
What’s striking about this story is that modern 
geneticists have pinpointed the mutations that 
humans took advantage of to create one of the 
world’s most widely used crops.
Primitive corn (called maize) put in its first 
appearance around 9,000 years ago. The prede-
cessor of maize is a grass called teosinte. You 
need a good imagination to see an ear of corn 
when you look at the seed heads of teosinte; 
there’s only a vague resemblance, and unlike 
corn, teosinte is only barely edible — it has a 
few rock hard kernels per stalk. Yet corn and 
teosinte (going by the scientific name of Zea 
mays) are the same species.
The five mutations that turned teosinte into 
maize popped up naturally and changed several 
things about teosinte to make it a more palat-
able food source:
 ✓ One gene controls where cobs appear on 
the plant stalk: Maize has its cobs along the 
entire stem instead of on long branches like 
teosinte.
 ✓ Three genes control sugar and starch stor-
age in the kernels: Maize is easier to digest 
and better tasting than teosinte.
 ✓ One gene controls the size and position of 
kernels on the cob: Unlike teosinte, maize 
has an appearance normally associated 
with modern corn.
Humans apparently used teosinte for food 
before it acquired its mutational makeover, so 
it’s likely that people caught on quickly to the 
change that developed. The mutations of the 
aforementioned five genes were cemented into 
the genome by selective harvest and planting of 
the new variety. People grew the mutated plants 
on purpose, and the only reason corn is so 
common now is because humans made it that 
way. The first true maize crops were planted 
in Mexico 6,250 years ago, and, as a popular 
addition to the diets of people in the area, its 
cultivation spread rapidly. Archeological sites 
in the United States bear evidence of maize 
cultivation as early as 3,200 years ago. By the 
time Europeans arrived, most native peoples in 
the New World grew maize to supplement their 
diets.

rays, and neutrons) and chemicals to produce mutant alleles aimed at pro-
ducing desired traits (see Chapter 13 for how radiation damages DNA to 
cause mutation). Plants that commonly receive radiation and chemical treat-
ment include
 
✓ Food crops: Fruits, vegetables, and grains are mutated to produce disease 
resistance and size and flavor variations, as well as to change the timing 
of fruiting. Over 2,000 different types of plants are genetically modified 
in this fashion. Believe it or not, you eat these varieties all the time. Ever 
had Rio Red grapefruit? If so, you enjoyed a mutated plant variety that 
acquired its deep red color from a neutron-induced mutation.
 
✓ Ornamentals: Many of the unusual ornamental plants you enjoy are the 
result of induced mutation. Roses, tulips, and chrysanthemums are all 
zapped to produce new flower colors.
Introducing unintentional modifications
Humans mutate plants on purpose, but we also constantly make uninten-
tional genetic modifications on natural populations, such as mosquitoes and 
bacteria:
 
✓ Mosquitoes: Overzealous pesticide use has made most mosquito popu-
lations DDT-resistant.
 
✓ Bacteria: Many common antibiotics are rapidly being rendered ineffec-
tive because susceptible bacteria are wiped out, leaving only resistant 
strains.
These changes in bacteria and mosquito populations are due to evolution-
ary change; essentially, humans set up selective breeding by changing the 
environment. Another unintentional modification occurs when transgenes 
escape from controlled crops to wild plants — which they’re likely to do with 
great frequency and efficiency. The wild plants are then genetically modified. 
These new, unintentional recipients of biotechnology are no less genetically 
modified than the crop plants (see the “Escaped transgenes” section later in 
the chapter).
Old Genes in New Places
If genetic modification is so ubiquitous, what’s the problem with transgenic 
organisms? After all, humans have been at this whole genetic modification 
thing for centuries, right? Not exactly. Historically, humans have modified 
organisms by controlling matings between animals and plants with preexist-
ing genetic compatibility.

287
 Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
 
Transgenics are often endowed with genes from very different species. (The 
bacterial gene that’s been popped into corn to make it resistant to attack by 
plant-eating insects is a good example.) Therefore, transgenic organisms wind 
up with genes that never could have moved from one organism to another 
without considerable help (or massive luck; see the “Traveling genes” sidebar 
for more about natural gene transfer events).
After these “foreign” genes get into an organism, they don’t necessarily stay 
put. One of the biggest issues with transgenic plants, for example, is uncon-
trolled gene transfer to other, unintended species. Another controversial 
aspect of transgenic organisms has to do with gene expression; many people 
worry that transgenes will be expressed in agricultural products in unwanted 
or unexpected ways, making foods toxic or carcinogenic.
 
To understand the promises and pitfalls of transgenics, you first need to know 
how transgenes are transferred and why. Recombinant DNA technology is the 
set of methods used for all transgenic applications. In Chapter 16, I cover the 
process used to find genes, snip them out of their original locations, and pop 
them into new locations (like the virus vectors used in gene therapy). The set 
of techniques used specifically to create transgenic organisms often goes by 
the title genetic engineering. Genetic engineering refers to the directed manipu-
lation of genes to alter phenotype in a particular way. Thus, genetic engineer-
ing is also used in gene therapy to bring in healthy genes to counteract the 
effects of mutations.
Traveling genes
Movement of genes from one organism to 
another usually occurs through mitosis or meio-
sis, the normal mechanisms of inheritance. With 
horizontal gene transfer, genes can move from 
one species to another without mating or cell 
division. Bacteria and viruses accomplish this 
task with ease; they can slip their genes into the 
genomes of their hosts to alter the functions of 
host genes or supply the hosts with new, some-
times unwanted ones. This movement of genes 
isn’t merely scientific fiction or a rare event, 
either. The appearance of antibiotic-resistant 
genes in various species of bacteria is due to 
horizontal gene transfers. Horizontal transfer 
also occurs in multicellular organisms (various 
species of fruit flies have shared their genes 
this way). One group of researchers has even 
shown that horizontal gene transfer may occur 
as a result of eating DNA. Yes, you read that 
correctly. The scientists fed mice a mixture that 
included DNA sequences not found anywhere 
in the mouse genome. The scientists found 
the experimentally introduced DNA circulat-
ing in the bloodstreams of their mice, strongly 
suggesting that horizontal transfer had actu-
ally occurred. Indeed, your own genome may 
owe some of its size and genetic complexity to 
genes acquired from bacteria. The possibility of 
genes turning up in unexpected places is real.

288
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Transgenic Plants Grow Controversy
 
Plants are really different from animals, but not in the way you may think. 
Plant cells are totipotent, meaning that practically any plant cell can eventually 
give rise to every sort of plant tissue: roots, leaves, and seeds. When animal 
cells differentiate during embryo development, they lose their totipotency 
forever (but the DNA in every cell retains the potential to be totipotent; see 
Chapter 20). For genetic engineers, the totipotency of plant cells reveals vast 
possibilities for genetic manipulation.
Much of the transgenic revolution in plants has focused on moving genes to 
plants from bacteria, other plants, and even animals, to achieve various ends, 
including nutritionally enhancing certain foods, such as rice. The strongest 
efforts are directed at altering crops to resist either herbicides used against 
unwanted competitor plants or the attack of plant-eating insects.
Following the transgenesis 
process in plants
In general, developing transgenic plants for commercial uses involves three 
major steps:
 
1. Find (or alter) the gene that controls desired traits such as herbicide 
resistance.
 
2. Slip the transgene into an appropriate delivery vehicle (a vector).
 
3. Create fully transgenic plants that pass on the new gene along with their 
seeds.
Pinpointing the right gene
The process of finding and mapping genes is pretty similar from one organ-
ism to another (see Chapter 16 for some of the details). After scientists 
identify the gene they want to transfer, they must alter the gene so that it 
works properly outside the original organism. All genes must have promoter 
sequences, the genetic landmarks that identify the start of a gene, to allow 
transcription to occur (for the scoop on transcription, flip to Chapter 9). 
When it comes to creating a transgenic plant, the promoter sequence in the 
original organism may not be very useful in the new plant host; as a result, 
a new promoter sequence is needed to make sure the gene gets turned on 
when and where it’s wanted.
Modifying the gene to reside in its new home
To date, the promoter sequences that genetic engineers use in transgenic 
plants are set to be always on. Therefore, the transgene’s products show up 

289
 Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
in all the tissues and cell types of the entire plant in which the transgene is 
inserted. The all-purpose promoter often used for transgenes in plants comes 
from a pathogen called cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV). CaMV seems to 
work well just about everywhere it’s used and is a reliable “on switch” for the 
transgenes with which it’s paired. When more precise regulation is needed, 
genetic engineers can use promoters that respond to conditions in the envi-
ronment (see Chapter 11 for more about how cues in the environment can 
control genes).
In addition to the promoter, genetic engineers must also find a good compan-
ion gene — called a marker gene — to accompany the transgene. The marker 
gene provides a strong and reliable signal indicating that the whole unit 
(marker and transgene) is in place and working. Common markers include 
genes that convey resistance to antibiotics. With these kinds of markers, 
geneticists grow transgenic plant cells in a medium that contains the anti-
biotic. Only the plants that have resistance (conveyed by the marker gene) 
survive, providing a quick and easy way to tell which cells have the transgene 
(alive) and which don’t (dead).
Getting new genes into the plant
To put new genes into plants, genetic engineers can either
 
✓ Use a vector system from a common soil bacterium called 
Agrobacterium. Agrobacterium is a plant pathogen that causes galls — 
big, ugly, tumor-like growths — to form on infected plants. In Figure 19-1, 
you can see what a gall looks like. Gall formation results from integration 
of bacterial genes directly into the infected plant’s chromosomes. The 
bacteria enters the plant from a wound such as a break in the plant’s stem 
that allows bacteria to get past the woody defense cells that protect the 
plant from pathogens (just as your skin protects you). The bacterial cells 
move into the plant cells (scientists aren’t sure exactly how they pull off 
this trick), and once inside, DNA from the bacteria’s plasmids — circular 
DNAs that are separate from the bacterial chromosome — integrate into 
the host plant’s DNA. The bacterial DNA pops itself in more or less ran-
domly and then hijacks the plant cell to allow it to replicate.
 
 Like the geneticists using virus vectors for gene therapy (see 
Chapter 16), genetic engineers snip out gall-forming genes from the 
Agrobacterium plasmids and replace them with transgenes. Host plant 
cells are grown in the lab and infected with the Agrobacterium. Because 
these cells are totipotent, they can be used to grow an entire plant — 
roots, leaves, and all — and every cell contains the transgene. When the 
plant forms seeds, those contain the transgene, too, ensuring that the 
transgene is passed to the offspring.
 
✓ Shoot plants with a gene gun so that microscopic particles of gold or 
other metals carry the transgene unit into the plant nucleus by brute 
force. Gene guns are a bit less dependable than Agrobacterium as a 
method for getting transgenes into plant cells. However, some plants are 

290
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
resistant to Agrobacterium, thus making the gene gun a viable alterna-
tive. With gene guns, the idea is to coat microscopic pellets with many 
copies of a transgene and by brute force (provided by compressed air) 
shove the pellets directly into the cell nuclei. By chance, some of the 
transgenes are inserted into the plant chromosomes.

Exploring commercial applications
Transgenic plants have made quite a splash in the world of agriculture. So 
far, the main applications of this technology have addressed two primary 
threats to crops:
 
✓ Weeds: The addition of herbicide-resistant genes make crop plants 
immune to the effects of weed-killing chemicals, allowing farmers to 
spread herbicides over their entire fields without worrying about killing 
their crops. Weeds compete with crop plants for water and nutrients, 
reducing yields considerably. Soybeans, cotton, and canola (a seed that 
produces cooking oil) are only a few of the crop plants that have been 
genetically altered to tolerate certain herbicides.
 
 A couple of different chemical companies have gotten into the trans-
genic plant business with the idea of producing crop plants that aren’t 
susceptible to herbicides the company makes. The companies then 
market their crop plants along with their chemicals.
 
✓ Bugs: The addition of transgenes that confer pest-killing properties to 
plants effectively reduces crop losses to plant-eating bugs. Geneticists 
provide pest-protection traits using the genes from Bacillus thuringiensis 
(otherwise known as Bt). Organic gardeners discovered the pesticide 
qualities of Bt, a soil bacterium, years ago. Bt produces a protein called 
Cry. When an insect eats the soil bacteria, digestion of Cry releases a 
toxin that kills the insect shortly after its meal. Transgenic corn and 

291
 Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
cotton carry the Bt Cry gene; there’s a potato version, too, but its cul-
tivation was hampered because fast-food restaurants and potato chip 
makers refused to purchase the transgenic potatoes.
Weighing points of contention
Few genetic issues have excited the almost hysterical response met by trans-
genic crop plants. European efforts over the past ten years to implement the 
use of transgenics have been particularly contentious. Nonetheless, by 2007, 
23 countries had approved transgenic crops for cultivation within their bor-
ders. Reports indicate that in some third-world countries, transgenic seeds 
are heavily traded on the black market as well. Opposition to transgenic 
plants generally falls into four basic categories, which I cover in this section.
Food safety issues
Normally, gene expression is highly regulated and tissue-specific, meaning 
that proteins produced in a plant’s leaves, for example, don’t necessarily 
show up in its fruits. Because of the way transgenes are inserted, however, 
their expression isn’t under tight control (because the genes are always “on”; 
see “Following the transgenesis process in plants” earlier in this chapter). 
Opponents to transgenics worry that proteins produced by transgenes may 
prove toxic, making foods produced by those crop plants unsafe to eat. 
Researchers usually evaluate the effects of chemicals and drugs by dosing 
animals (usually rats and mice) with ever-increasing amounts of the chemi-
cal until they observe effects. Food products are more complicated to test, 
though, because test animals get not only the protein produced by the trans-
gene but the food as well, making it hard to parse out the effects of one ingre-
dient over another. Instead of going the megadose route with animal testing, 
safety evaluations of transgenic crops rely on a concept called substantial 
equivalence.
Substantial equivalence is a detailed comparison of transgenic crop products 
with their nontransgenic equivalents. This comparison involves chemical and 
nutritional analyses, including tests for toxic substances. If the transgenic 
product has some detectable difference, that trait is targeted for further eval-
uation. Thus, substantial equivalence is based on the assumptions that any 
ingredient or component of the nontransgenic product is already deemed 
safe and that only new differences found in the transgenic version are worth 
investigating. For example, in the case of transgenic potatoes, unmodified 
potatoes are thought to be safe, so only Bt is slated for further tests. In spite 
of comparison testing, researchers have had difficulty documenting any 
unwanted side effects from food produced with transgenic crops. Millions 
of persons each year consume food produced with these crops, and no ill 
effects have been documented thus far.

292
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
 
One research report published in 1999 documented the possibly hazardous 
nature of transgenic food. In short, the study reported evidence that rats’ 
immune systems and organs were damaged by consuming transgenic potatoes. 
Upon its release, the study generated a great deal of controversy, in part 
because one of the authors of the study announced his findings before the 
paper was accepted for publication in any scientific journal. That may not 
sound like a big deal, but it means that experts in the field hadn’t evaluated the 
work before it was made public. Evaluation of research results as part of the 
publication process is called peer review. Peer review is meant to prevent erro-
neous or bogus findings from being reported as fact. In the case of the trans-
genic potato uproar, the talkative author was severely castigated by the 
scientific community for announcing his results as valid when no evaluations 
other than his own had occurred. The work was eventually published, but its 
conclusions haven’t been easy to replicate, suggesting that the result may not 
be valid.
Escaped transgenes
The escape of transgenes into other hosts is a widely reported fear of trans-
genics opponents. Canola, a common oil-seed crop, provides one good exam-
ple of how quickly transgenes can get around. Herbicide-resistant canola was 
marketed in Canada in 1996 or so. By 1998, wild canola plants in fields where 
no transgenic crop had ever been grown already had not one but two differ-
ent transgenes for herbicide resistance. This finding was quite a surprise 
because no commercially available transgenic canola came equipped with 
both transgenes. It’s likely that the accidental transgenic acquired its new 
genes via pollination.
In 2002, several companies in the United States failed to take adequate precau-
tions mandated by law to prevent the escape of corn transgenes via pollina-
tion or the accidental germination of untended transgenic seeds. These lapses 
resulted in fines — and the release of transgenes into unintended crops.
Actual transgene escape isn’t widely documented yet, but containment of 
transgenes is virtually impossible. Introgression, the transfer of transgenes 
from one plant to another, has the potential to occur relatively frequently. 
Canola, sunflowers, wheat, sugar beets, alfalfa, and sorghum readily share 
genes with related plants. Most of these plants are wind-pollinated, mean-
ing that mature plants easily spread their genes over very broad regions 
every time the breeze blows. For example, one transgenic grass used on golf 
courses passed its transgene for herbicide resistance on to a wild relative 
that was a whopping 12 miles away!
Movements of transgenes for pest and herbicide resistance may pale in the 
face of the newest wave of transgenic plants: pharmaceuticals. The goal of this 
movement is to use plants to produce proteins that were previously difficult 
or prohibitively costly to manufacture. Drugs to treat disease, edible vaccines, 
and industrial chemicals are just a few of the possibilities. As of this writing, 
actual field trials for some of these transgenic plants are already underway. 

293
 Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
The consequences for transgene escape from these sorts of crops could be 
dire — and frankly, containment failures of other transgenic crops don’t bode 
well for future containment prospects. And unlike Bt and herbicide-ready 
transgenics, the compounds produced by pharmaceuticals are truly biologi-
cally active in humans, making them truly dangerous to human health.
Developing resistance
The third major point of opposition to transgenics — the development of 
resistance to transgene effects — is connected to the widespread movement 
of transgenes. The point of developing most of these transgenic crops is to 
make controlling weeds or insect pests easier. Additionally, transgenic crops 
(particularly transgenic cotton) have the potential to significantly reduce 
chemical use, which is a huge environmental plus. However, when weeds or 
insects acquire resistance to transgene effects, the chemicals that transgen-
ics are designed to replace are rendered obsolete.
Full-blown resistance development depends on artificial selection supplied 
by the herbicide or the plant itself. Resistance develops and spreads when 
insects that are susceptible to the pesticide transgene being used are all 
killed. The only insects that survive and reproduce are, you guessed it, able 
to tolerate the pesticide transgene. Insects produce hundreds of thousands 
of offspring, so it doesn’t take long to replace susceptible populations with 
resistant ones. To counter the threat of resistance development, users of 
transgenic crops advocate nontransgenic refuges — places where nontrans-
genic crops are grown to support populations of susceptible bugs. The idea 
is that inheritance of the transgene resistance is diluted by the genes of sus-
ceptible bugs. So far, the implementation of refuges has seen limited success; 
in all likelihood, refuges may only slow the spread of resistance, not prevent 
it altogether.
Damaging unintended targets
The argument against transgenic plants is that nontarget organisms may 
suffer ill effects. For example, when Bt corn was introduced (see “Exploring 
commercial applications”), controversy arose surrounding the corn’s tox-
icity to beneficial insects (that is, bugs that eat other bugs) and desirable 
creatures like butterflies. Indeed, Bt is toxic to some of these insects, but it’s 
unclear how much damage these natural populations sustain from Bt plants. 
The biggest threat to migratory monarch butterflies is likely habitat destruc-
tion in their overwintering sites in Mexico, not Bt corn.
Assessing outcomes
 
Transgenic plants appear to help reduce the amount of pesticides used, but 
only by a small margin (between 1 and 3 percent). Since the development of 
transgenic plants, herbicide use has actually increased, presumably because 
the chemicals can be freely broadcast onto herbicide-ready crops. However, the 

294
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
impact of herbicide-resistant crops on no-till, a farming method that significantly 
reduces erosion and soil loss, is positive; more farmers have turned to no-till 
as they’ve adopted transgenic crops. But if weeds acquire the transgenes, this 
improvement will be promptly reversed. In fact, transgenic crops don’t seem to 
have increased yields very much. Despite the relatively scant advantages and 
extremely strong opposition (especially in Europe), advocates of transgenic 
crops remain optimistic and hopeful for an agricultural revolution.
Looking at the GMO Menagerie
Transgenic critters are all over the place. Animals, insects, and bacteria have 
all gotten in on the fun. In this section, you take a trip to the transgenic zoo.
Transgenic animals
Mice were the organisms of choice in the development of transgenic meth-
ods. Scientists discovered that genes could be inserted into a mouse’s 
genome during the process of fertilization. When a sperm enters an egg, 
there’s a brief period before the two sets of DNA (maternal and paternal) 
fuse to become one. The two sets of DNA existing during this intermission 
are called pronuclei. Geneticists discovered that by injecting many copies of 
the transgene (with its promoter and sometimes with a marker gene, too; see 
the earlier section “Modifying the gene to reside in its new home”) directly 
into the paternal pronucleus (see Figure 19-2), the transgene was sometimes 
integrated into the embryo’s chromosomes. (Eggs can be injected with trans-
genes after the pronuclei fuse, but uptake of the transgene is somewhat less 
efficient.)
 
Not all the embryo’s cells contain the transgene, however, because the uptake 
of the transgene takes place during cell division; sometimes, several rounds of 
division occur before the transgene gets scooped up. The cells that do have 
the transgene often have multiple copies (oddly, these end up together in a 
head-to-tail arrangement), and the transgenes are inserted into the mouse’s 
chromosomes at random. The resulting, partly transgenic mouse is called a 
chimera, or a mosaic. Mosaicism is the expression of genes in some but not all 
cells of a given individual, making gene expression somewhat patchy. To get 
a fully transgenic animal, many chimeras are mated in the hope that homozy-
gous transgenic offspring will be produced from one or more matings. After 
researchers obtain homozygotes, they isolate the transgene line so that no 
heterozygotes are formed by mating transgenic animals with nontransgenic 
animals.

One of the first applications of the highly successful mouse transgenesis 
method used growth hormone genes. Rat, human, and bovine growth hor-
mone genes produced much larger mice than normal. The result encouraged 
the idea that growth hormone genes engineered into meat animals such as 
the following would allow faster production of larger, leaner animals:
 
✓ Pigs and cows: Transgenic pigs haven’t fared very well; in studies, they 
grew faster than their nontransgenic counterparts but only when fed 
large amounts of protein. And female transgenic pigs turned out to be 
sterile. All pigs showed muscle weakness, and many developed arthritis 
and ulcers. Cows haven’t done any better. So far, no commercially viable 
transgenic cows or pigs engineered for growth have been produced and, 
as of 2009, the U.S. authorities still haven’t given the go-ahead for these 
animals to be part of the food supply.
 
✓ Fish: Unlike pigs and cows, fish do swimmingly with transgenes (see 
the sidebar “Transgenic pets: Not all fun and games” for one applica-
tion of transgenics in fish). Transgenic salmon grow six times faster 
than their nontransgenic cousins and convert their food to body weight 
much more efficiently, meaning that less food makes a bigger fish. So far, 
Atlantic salmon are targeted for the growth-enhancing gene, but none 
are commercially available yet. Transgenic fish would be raised in pens 
situated in larger bodies of water, making escape of transgenics into wild 
populations a certainty. Plus, natural salmon populations are severely 
depleted due to overharvest. Farmed fish tend to be highly aggressive 
and are feared to out-compete their wild relatives. Thus, farm-raised 
salmon pose a threat to natural populations of both their own and other 
fish species as well. Here, too, U.S. regulators haven’t given the go-
ahead, and transgenic salmon aren’t approved for human consumption.
Primates have also been targeted for transgenesis as a way to study human 
disorders including aging, neurological diseases, and immune disorders. The 
first transgenic monkey was born in 2000. This rhesus monkey was endowed 
with a simple marker gene because the purpose of the study was simply to 
determine whether transgenesis in monkeys was possible. The marker gene 
used was the one that produces green fluorescence in jellyfish. This gene has 

296
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
been successfully inserted into plants, frogs, and mice, but those recipients 
rarely glow green. The monkey recipient is no exception: Her chromosomes 
bear the gene, but no functional fluorescent protein is produced — yet. Twin 
monkeys produced in the same project died before birth, but both had fluo-
rescent fingernails and hair follicles. Because some transgenic animals dis-
play delayed onset of the gene function, the surviving monkey may yet glow. 
Even with this modest success, monkeys’ reproductive cycles aren’t easy to 
manipulate, so progress with transgenic primates is slow.
Transgenic pets: Not all fun and games
Ever have one of those groovy posters that glows 
under a black light? Well, move that black light 
over to the aquarium — there’s a new fish in town. 
Originally derived from zebrafish, a tiny, black-
and-white–striped native of India’s Ganges River, 
these glowing versions bear a gene that makes 
them fluorescent. The little, red, glow-in-the-dark 
wonders (one report calls them “Frankenfish”) are 
the first commercially available transgenic pets.
Zebrafish are tried-and-true laboratory 
veterans — they even have their own scientific 
journal! Developmental biologists love zebrafish 
because their transparent eggs make it simple to 
observe development. Geneticists use zebrafish 
to study the functions of all sorts of genes, many 
of which have direct counterparts in other organ-
isms, including humans. And genetic engineers 
have taken advantage of these easy-to-keep fish, 
too; scientists in Singapore saw the potential to 
use zebrafish as little pollution indicators. The 
Singapore geneticists use a gene from jellyfish to 
make their zebrafish glow in the dark. The action 
of the fluorescent gene is set up to respond to 
cues in the environment (like hormones, toxins, 
or temperature; see Chapter 11 for how environ-
mental cues turn on your genes). The transgenic 
zebrafish then provide a quick and easy to read 
signal: If they glow, a pollutant is present.
Of course, glowing fish are so unique that some 
enterprising soul couldn’t let lab scientists have 
all the fun. Thus, these made-over zebrafish 
have hit pet stores. Many scientists don’t see 
the humor in making transgenic fish available 
to the public, however. The state of California 
has banned their sale outright, and at least one 
major pet store chain refuses to sell them. The 
main objection so far seems to be an ethical 
one — opponents object to genetic engineering 
used for “trivial” purposes (see Chapter 21 for 
details about ethics and genetics). The U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), however, has 
deemed glowing zebrafish safe (they’re nontoxic, 
and no, you won’t glow if you eat one).
A more serious and biologically relevant argument 
against glowing exotic fish may be the threat of 
invasive species. Invasive species present all 
kinds of nasty problems for the environment. 
For example, the reason you don’t enjoy home-
grown chestnuts in the United States anymore 
is because an introduced plant disease literally 
wiped out every single tree. Introduced insects, 
plants, and animals represent an enormous 
and expensive threat to agriculture worldwide. 
Regular zebrafish already live in Florida’s warm 
waters, along with a dizzying number of other 
nonnative fish that collectively threaten to destroy 
the native fish community entirely. Glowing fish 
may be only the beginning, by the way. Reports 
suggest that glow-in-the-dark lawn grasses and 
grasses in unusual colors are in the works. And 
remarkable glowing colors are only one possibil-
ity. One company has announced plans to make 
hypoallergenic cats! (But don’t hold your breath; 
animals don’t respond well to the random inser-
tion of genes into their chromosomes, so the 
production of sneeze-free kitties is a distant 
dream.)

297
 Chapter 19: Genetic Makeovers: Fitting New Genes into Plants and Animals
Trifling with transgenic insects
A number of uses for transgenic insects appear to be on the horizon. Malaria 
and other mosquito-borne diseases are a major health problem worldwide, 
but the use of pesticides to combat mosquito populations is problematic 
because resistant populations rapidly replace susceptible ones. And in fact, 
the problem isn’t really the mosquitoes themselves (despite what you may 
think when you’re being buzzed and bitten). The problem is the parasites and 
viruses the mosquitoes carry and transmit through their bites. In response 
to these problems, researchers are developing transgenic mosquitoes unable 
to carry parasites or viruses, rendering their bites itchy but otherwise harm-
less. Unfortunately, it’s not clear how or if transgenic mosquitoes could 
replace populations of bugs that carry diseases.
Other attempts at biological control of insects have met with limited success. 
They usually involve the release of millions of sterile bugs that attract the 
mating attentions of fertile ones. The matings result in infertile eggs, reducing 
the reproduction of the target insect population. Part of the downside of this 
environmentally friendly approach to pest control is that sterility is induced 
using radiation, and irradiated insects lack the vigor needed to aggressively 
pursue sex. Transgenic infertility may solve the problem. The general pro-
cess is the same, but the transgenically infertile insects still have the energy 
needed to pursue mates, resulting in a more effective pest control strategy. 
This is an especially appealing idea when used to combat invasive species 
that can sweep through crops with economically devastating results.
 
The whole transgenic pesticide-resistance affair may be used to enhance natu-
ral control of pest populations by using insects that make a living eating other 
bugs. The idea is to create beneficial insects that bear the transgene that 
confers pesticide resistance. The farmers can then put out pesticides to kill 
susceptible insects and release beneficial bug predators to do the rest. Such 
a strategy may reduce pesticide use dramatically and eliminate the need for 
transgenic, insect-resistant crops.
Another transgenic insect project in the works uses silkworms that are 
equipped with a gene used to make human skin protein. The intention is to 
mass produce the protein for use in human skin grafts needed after burns 
and to aid with wound healing.
Fiddling with transgenic bacteria
Bacteria are extremely amenable to transgenesis. Unlike other transgenic 
organisms, genes can be inserted into bacteria with great precision, making 
expression far easier to control. As a result, many products can be produced 

298
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
using bacteria, which can be grown under highly controlled conditions, 
essentially eliminating the danger of transgene escape. (The techniques used 
to slip genes into bacteria chromosomes are identical to those used in gene 
therapy, which I describe in Chapter 16.)
 
Many important drugs are produced by recombinant bacteria, such as insulin 
for treatment of diabetes, clotting factors for the treatment of hemophilia, and 
human growth hormone for the treatment of some forms of dwarfism. These 
sorts of medical advances can have important side benefits as well:
 
✓ Transgenic bacteria can produce much greater volumes of proteins than 
traditional methods.
 
✓ Transgenic bacteria are safer than animal substitutes, such as pig insu-
lin, which are slightly different from the human version and therefore 
may cause allergic reactions.
 
✓ Transgenic bacteria are much less controversial than other organisms 
and thus are well received for the production of medications.
Transgenic bacteria are also used for applications down on the farm. Bovine 
somatotropin, better known as bovine growth hormone, increases milk pro-
duction in cows. Transgenic bacteria are used to produce large quantities of 
the hormone (called rbGH for recombinant bovine growth hormone), which 
is injected into dairy cows to boost milk production. Despite outcries to 
the contrary, studies show that rbGH isn’t active in humans, meaning that 
humans don’t respond to bovine growth hormone even when it’s injected 
in their bodies. Furthermore, milk produced by cows injected with rbGH 
is chemically indistinguishable from milk produced by cows injected with 
the actual hormone. The advantage of rbGH is that it allows fewer cows to 
produce more milk — a good thing, because dairies represent a significant 
source of fecal pollution in rivers and streams, and fewer cows means less 
pollution. The downside is that cows treated with rbGH are more vulnerable 
to infection, requiring treatment with antibiotics and thus increasing the risk 
of developing antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Recent advances in biotechnology may produce other gains in protecting the 
environment. For example, work is underway to take advantage of the pro-
duction of biodegradable plastics using bacteria-produced chemicals called 
polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). PHAs are molecules that are used like fats to 
store energy. They’re also very similar to the plastics made from petroleum 
that you see all the time. Researchers have taken the gene that makes PHA 
and popped it into E. coli to produce enough PHA with which to manufacture 
products. And it’s likely that PHAs will find their way into the marketplace as 
a viable alternative to traditional plastics.

Depending on your point of view, cloning organisms may sound like a night-
mare or a dream come true. Whatever your opinion, cloning is most defi-
nitely not science fiction; decisions about experimental cloning are being 
made right now, every day. This chapter covers cloning: what it is, how it’s 
done, and what its impact is from a biological point of view. You get to know 
the problems inherent in clones, along with the arguments for and against 
cloning (not just of humans — of animals and plants, too). Get ready for an 
interesting story, and remember, it ain’t fiction!
Send in the Clones
 
A clone is simply an identical copy. When geneticists talk about cloning, 
they’re most often talking about copying some part of the DNA (usually a 
gene). Geneticists clone DNA in the lab every day — the technology is simple, 
routine, and unremarkable. Cloning genes is a vital part of
 
✓ DNA sequencing (see Chapter 8)
 
✓ The study of gene functions (see Chapter 11)
 
✓ The creation of recombinant organisms (see Chapter 16)
 
✓ The development of gene therapy (see Chapter 16)

Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Another meaning of the word cloning is to make a copy of an entire organism 
as a reproductive strategy. When referring to a whole creature as opposed to 
DNA, a clone is an organism that’s created via asexual reproduction, mean-
ing that offspring are produced without the parent having sex first. Cloning 
occurs naturally all the time in bacteria, plants, insects, fish, and lizards. For 
example, one type of asexual reproduction is parthenogenesis, which occurs 
when a female makes eggs that develop into offspring without being fertilized 
by a male (for some of you female readers, I’m sure this sounds very appeal-
ing). So if reproduction by cloning is a natural, normal biological process, 
what’s the big deal with cloning organisms using technology?
Cloning Animals: Like No Udder
Cloning animals hit the news big time in 1997 with the birth of Dolly, an unre-
markable looking Finn Dorset lamb. Named after the well-endowed country 
singer Dolly Parton, Dolly the sheep was a clone of one of her mother’s udder 
cells. (If you didn’t grow up on a farm, udders are the part of the animal that 
produces milk — in other words, breasts. Hence the name of everyone’s 
favorite clone.) I use the term “mother” rather loosely when it comes to 
Dolly; the cells came from one animal, the egg was derived from a second 
animal, and yet a third female was the birth mom.
Dolly’s name was intended as a bit of a joke, but the fact that an animal had 
been cloned meant many people weren’t laughing. Images of a future filled with 
mass-produced human beings began to fill the minds of many. Clones aren’t 
unique individuals and, in cases like Dolly’s, are produced via technology. 
Therefore, human rights advocates and religious leaders often object to clon-
ing on moral or ethical grounds (see “Arguments against cloning” later in this 
chapter).
 
Despite her ordinary appearance, Dolly was unique in that no other mammal 
had been reproduced successfully via cloning using a somatic (body) cell (see 
the section “Discovering why Dolly is really something to bah about” later in 
the chapter). But Dolly wasn’t the first organism to be cloned.
Cloning before Dolly: 
Working with sex cells
 
Experimental cloning started in the 1950s. In 1952, researchers transplanted 
the nucleus from a frog embryo into a frog egg. This and subsequent experi-
ments were designed not to clone frogs but to discover the basis of totipotent 
cells. Totipotent cells are capable of becoming any sort of cell and are the 
basis for all multicellular organisms. Totipotency lies at the heart of develop-
mental genetics.

301
 Chapter 20: Cloning: You’re One of a Kind
For most organisms, after an egg is fertilized, the zygote begins developing 
by cell division, which I walk you through in Chapter 2. Division proceeds 
through 2, 4, 8, and 16 cells. After the zygote reaches the 16-cell stage, the 
cells wind up in a hollow ball arrangement called a blastocyst. Figure 20-1 
shows the stages of development from 2 cells to blastocyst.

opment of a

Blastocyst 
 
Zygote development in mammals is unique because the cells don’t all divide at 
the same time or in the same order. Instead of proceeding neatly from 2 to 4 to 
8, the cells often wind up in odd numbers. Mammal zygotes have a unique stage 
of development, called compaction, when the cells go from being separate little 
balls into a single, multicellular unit (refer to Figure 20-1). Compaction occurs 
after the third round of cell division. After compaction, the cells divide again (up 
to roughly 16), the inner cell mass forms (this will become the fetus), and fluid 
accumulates in the center of the ball of cells to form the blastocyst.
After a few more divisions, the cells rearrange into a three-layered ball called a 
gastrula. The innermost layer of the gastrula is endoderm (literally “inner skin”), 
the middle is mesoderm (“middle skin”), and the outermost is ectoderm (“outer 
skin”). Each layer is composed of a batch of cells, so from the gastrula stage 
onward, what cells turn into depends on which layer they start out in. In other 
words, the cells are no longer totipotent; they have specific functions.
 
So why is totipotency important? The entire body plan of an organism is 
coded in its DNA. Practically every cell gets a copy of the entire body plan (in 
the cell nucleus; see Chapter 6 for more on DNA and cells). Despite having 
access to the entire genome, however, eye cells produce only eye cells, not 
blood cells or muscle cells. All cells arise from totipotent cells but end up nul-
lipotent — able to produce only cells like themselves. Totipotent cells hold 
the key to gene expression and what turns genes on and off (which I cover in 
detail in Chapter 11). Understanding what controls totipotency also has broad 

302
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
implications for curing diseases such as cancer (see Chapter 14), treating 
spinal cord injuries using totipotent stem cells (see Chapter 23), and curing 
inherited disorders (see Chapter 15).
Discovering why Dolly is really 
something to bah about
 
The scientific breakthrough that Dolly the sheep signifies isn’t cloning. The 
real breakthrough is that Dolly started off as a nullipotent cell nucleus. For 
many years, scientists couldn’t be certain that loss of totipotency didn’t 
involve some change at the genetic level. In other words, researchers won-
dered if the DNA itself got altered during the process of going from totipotent 
to nullipotent. Dolly convincingly demonstrated that nuclear DNA is nuclear 
DNA regardless of what sort of cell it comes from. (See Chapter 6 for more 
about nuclear DNA.) Theoretically, any cell nucleus is capable of returning to 
totipotency. That may turn out to be very good news.
The promise of therapeutic cloning is that someday doctors will be able to har-
vest your cells, use your DNA to make totipotent cells, and then use those cells 
to cure your life-threatening disease or restore your damaged spinal cord to full 
working order. However, creating totipotent cells from nullipotent cells to treat 
injury or disease is difficult and triggers significant ethical debates (see “Fighting 
the Clone Wars” later in this chapter), so realizing the potential of therapeutic 
cloning may be a very long way off. Meanwhile, reproductive cloning — the pro-
cess of creating offspring asexually — is already causing quite a stir. For a taste 
of some of the excitement, see the sidebar “Aclone in the universe?”
Aclone in the universe?
When a human clone was reportedly born in 
December 2002, the news wasn’t wholly unex-
pected. A company called Clonaid made the 
announcement and, purportedly, the clone; 
the company claimed that one cloned child had 
been born and numerous clone babies were 
on the way. The question is: On their way from 
where? As it turns out, Clonaid was founded 
by a group called the Raelians. While being 
entertained by sexy robots on board an alien 
spacecraft, Rael, the group’s founder, report-
edly learned that all humans are descended 
from clones created 25,000 years ago by space 
aliens.
But Clonaid’s claims (all of them, including the 
sexy robot thing) are unsubstantiated. Shortly 
after the initial announcement of cloning suc-
cess, Clonaid was invited to submit samples for 
genetic testing to support its claim. Ultimately, 
Clonaid refused genetic tests as an infringe-
ment on the right to privacy by the cloned 
child’s parents. There’s no word on how many 
parents the cloned child may have (with the

Creating Clones
Despite the fact that rats, mice, goats, cows, horses, pigs, and cats have all 
been cloned, cloning isn’t easy or routine. Cloning efficiency (the number of 
live offspring per cloning attempt) is generally very low. Dolly, for example, 
was the only live offspring out of 277 tries. All sorts of other biological 
problems also arise from cloning, but to understand them, you first need to 
understand how clones are created. (I return to the subject of challenges 
and problems in the “Confronting Problems with Clones” section later in the 
chapter.)
Making twins
One simple way to make a clone is to take advantage of the natural process 
of twinning. Identical twins normally arise from a single fertilized egg, called a 
zygote (see the “Cloning before Dolly: Working with sex cells” section earlier 
in the chapter). The zygote goes through a few rounds of cell division, and 
then the cells separate into two groups, each going on to form one offspring.
 
Artificial twinning is relatively simple and was first done successfully (in 
sheep) in 1979. A single fertilized egg was used, meaning that the offspring 
was the result of sexual reproduction. Zygotes from normally fertilized (sexu-
ally produced) eggs were harvested from ewes (female sheep). The zygote 
was allowed to divide up to the 16-cell stage (see the “Cloning before Dolly: 
Working with sex cells” section earlier in the chapter). The 16 cells were then 
divided into two groups, which went right on dividing, and after they were 
implanted into the reproductive tract of the ewe, they resulted in twins. The 
twins were genetically identical to each other because they were produced 
from the same fertilized egg.
In cows, about 25 percent of artificial embryo splits result in twin births; 
75 percent result in only one calf. Nonetheless, the procedure is successful 
enough to increase the number of calves by about 50 percent over conven-
tional fertilizations. This sort of cloning is relatively routine in agricultural 
egg mother, womb mother, and cell donor, it 
could be as many as three different people!). 
At the time of this writing, Clonaid continues 
to tout human cloning services for which it 
reportedly charges $200,000. Among other 
interesting tidbits, its Web site says that the 
company found living cells in a body that was 
dead for over four months, giving a whole new 
meaning to the “living dead.”

settings and has received surprisingly little attention in the debate over clon-
ing. The fact that the clones arise from a fertilized egg may have dampened 
the furor somewhat.
Using a somatic cell nucleus 
to make a clone
Somatic cells are body cells. Typically, body cells are nullipotent, meaning 
they only make more of the same kind of cell by mitosis (see Chapter 2 for all 
the details on mitosis). For example, your bone cells only make more bone 
cells, your blood cells only make more blood cells, and so on. Most somatic 
cells have nuclei that contain all the information needed to make an entire 
organism — in the case of cloning, a clone of the cell’s owner (sometimes 
referred to as a donor).
Harvesting the donor cell
The choice of cell type used for cloning isn’t trivial. The cells must grow 
well in vitro (literally “in glass,” as in a test tube), and those from the female 
reproductive tract (mammary, uterine, and ovarian cells) seem to work best. 
Sorry, guys, but so far, very few clones are male.
Because body cells are often in the process of dividing (mitosis), the donor’s 
cell must be treated to stop cell division and leave the cell in the G0 stage of 
mitosis (see Chapter 2). In this state, the chromosomes are “relaxed,” and the 
DNA isn’t undergoing replication. After the cell is made inactive, the nucleus 
of the donor cell and all the chromosomes inside it are harvested. This har-
vest is usually accomplished by gently drawing the cell nucleus out with a 
needle attached to a syringe-like tool called a pipette. The process of remov-
ing a cell nucleus is called enucleation, and the resulting cell is enucleated 
(that is, lacking a nucleus).
Harvesting the egg cell
To complete the process of making a clone using the somatic cell method, 
another cell is needed — this time, an egg cell. Egg cells are generally the 
largest cells in the body. In fact, a mature mammalian egg cell is visible to 
the naked eye; it’s about the size of a very small speck of dust, like what you 
might see floating in the air when a shaft of sunlight pierces an otherwise 
dark room.
To harvest an egg cell, the female animal (here, called the egg mother) is 
treated with a hormone to stimulate ovulation. When the egg mother pro-
duces eggs, she first makes an oocyte, or immature egg (see Chapter 2 for 
a full rundown of egg production as part of gametogenesis). At the oocyte 

305
 Chapter 20: Cloning: You’re One of a Kind
stage, the egg has completed the first round of meiosis (meiosis I) but isn’t 
ready to be fertilized. The oocyte is harvested, and all the chromosomes 
are removed (oocytes don’t really have nuclei to contain chromosomes) 
using the same method used for the somatic cell, leaving only the cytoplasm 
behind (take a peek at Figure 20-2). Also remaining in the oocyte’s cytoplasm 
are mitochondria, which each contain a copy of the egg mother’s mito-
chondrial DNA (see Chapter 6). After the clone is formed, the egg mother’s 
mitochondrial DNA and the donor cell’s nuclear DNA may interact and have 
unexpected consequences (see “Confronting Problems with Clones” later in 
this chapter).
As it turns out, some egg cells are really versatile. Rabbit egg cells have been 
used to clone cats, for example. Generally, though, staying within a species 
works best — that is, cat egg cells work best with cat somatic cell nuclei. See 
the sidebar “Clone, Spot, clone!” for more about cloned kitties.
Putting it all together
With both the donor cell and the egg cell in hand, the nucleus from the 
donor cell is injected into the enucleated oocyte (see Figure 20-2). The 
donor nucleus is fused with the oocyte using a brief electrical shock. This 
little jump-start plays the part of fertilization: The oocyte starts dividing and 
begins developing into an embryo. After cell division is well established, the 
dividing cells are implanted into a female (the birth or gestation mother) for 
the remainder of the pregnancy. Dolly the sheep clone was born after 148 
days of gestation, which is about 5 days longer than average for a Finn Dorset 
sheep.
Clone, Spot, clone!
Yes, folks, it’s possible to clone your kitty or 
duplicate your doggie. That was the promise of 
a company called Genetic Savings and Clone, 
which offered tissue preservation services and 
cloning. The first cloned cat, named CC for Copy 
Cat, was produced by researchers at Texas 
A&M University in 2002 (the ultimate revenge 
for all those Aggie jokes, I guess). The work, 
funded by billionaire John Sperling, was origi-
nally meant for canine cloning. Sperling wanted 
to clone his own beloved dog, Missy, who died 
in 2002. Like most cloning efforts, success 
rates are low; only one in 87 attempts produce 
a live kitten. But as it turns out, that old phrase 
“copy cat” has a deeper meaning — cats are 
a lot easier to clone than dogs for a number of 
reasons. Dogs’ reproductive biology isn’t very 
amenable to the forced ovulation required for 
oocyte harvesting. Unfortunately, demand for 
cloned pets wasn’t sufficient to keep Genetic 
Savings and Clone in business; they folded in 
2006.

Confronting Problems with Clones
At birth, Dolly seemed normal in every way. She grew to adulthood, was 
mated to a ram, and gave birth to her own lambs (a total of six over her life-
time). However, Dolly lived only 6 years; normally, Finn Dorsets live 11 or 12 
years. Dolly became ill with a lung disease and was euthanized to relieve her 
suffering. The first hint that Dolly wasn’t completely normal was arthritis. She 
developed painful inflammation in her joints when she was only 4 years old. 
Arthritis isn’t unusual in sheep, but it usually only occurs in very old animals.
 
As it turns out, a number of abnormalities are common among clones. Clones 
suffer from a variety of physical ailments, including heart malformations, high 
blood pressure, kidney defects, impaired immunity to diseases, liver disor-
ders, malformed body parts, diabetes, and obesity. The following sections 
examine the most common physical problems clones face.
Faster aging
Before somatic cells divide during mitosis, the DNA in each cell must repli-
cate (see Chapter 7 for replication information). Each chromosome is copied 
except for the chromosomes’ ends, called telomeres, which aren’t fully rep-
licated. As a result, telomeres shorten as the cell goes through repeated 
rounds of mitosis. Shortening of telomeres is associated with aging because 
it happens over time (see the sidebar “Your aging DNA” for more). Telomere 
shortening may mean problems for clones created through somatic nucleus 
transfer because, in essence, such clones start out with “aged” DNA.

307
 Chapter 20: Cloning: You’re One of a Kind
Dolly the cloned sheep had abnormally short telomeres, giving rise to the 
worry that perhaps all clones may suffer from degenerative diseases because 
of premature aging. Research with other clones has provided conflicting 
results. Some clones, like Dolly, have shortened telomeres. Surprisingly, 
some clones seem to have reversed the effects of aging; specifically, their 
telomeres are repaired and end up longer than those of the donor. What this 
reversal suggests is that embryonic cells have telomerase, the enzyme that 
builds new telomeres using an RNA template during DNA replication (see 
Chapter 7 for more about telomerase and its role in replication). In the end, 
the possibility of premature aging in clones is a real one, but not all clones 
seem to be susceptible to it.
Your aging DNA
As you get older, your body changes: You get 
wrinkles, your parts start to sag, and your hair 
goes gray. Eventually, the chromosomes in 
some of your cells get so short that they can no 
longer function properly, and the cells die. This 
progressive cell death is thought to cause the 
unwelcome signs of aging you’re familiar with. 
In fact, the shortening of telomeres in most 
animals is so predictable that it can be used to 
determine how old an animal is.
All your cells have the genes to make telomer-
ase (see Chapter 7). But telomerase genes are 
turned on only in certain kinds of cells: germ 
cells (those that make eggs and sperm), bone 
marrow cells, skin cells, hair follicle cells, and 
the cells that line the intestinal walls (in other 
words, cells that divide a lot). Cancer cells also 
have telomerase activity, a fact that allows the 
unregulated growth of tumors that’s sometimes 
fatal (see Chapter 14 for more on genetics and 
cancer).
In experiments, mice without a functioning 
telomerase gene age faster than normal mice. 
This finding led some researchers to believe 
that telomerase may be used (eventually) to 
reverse or prevent aging in humans. Recently, 
however, research shows that telomere length 
is only part of the story. Telomeres interact with 
proteins that cover them and act as caps. When 
those protein caps are missing, the cell cycle 
gets disrupted and may stop altogether, caus-
ing premature cell death. Finally, stress may 
play a significant role in how fast telomeres 
shorten. A study of mothers with chronically 
ill children showed that signs of aging were 
accelerated in the moms of ill children com-
pared to moms of the same age with healthy 
children. The stressed moms had shortened 
telomeres and, from a cellular point of view, 
were up to 10 years older than their actual ages. 
Although telomerase may someday be part of 
treating stress and aging, research indicates 
that the best bet against aging may be lowering 
stress levels the old-fashioned way: rest and 
relaxation.

Bigger offspring
Clones tend to be physically large; at birth, they have higher than average 
weight and larger than normal body size. Many clones, such as cows and 
sheep, must be delivered by cesarean section because they’re too large to 
be born naturally. In part, the large birth size of clones is due to the fact that 
they stay in the womb longer than usual. Dolly the cloned sheep, for example, 
was born about five days after her birth mother’s “due date.” Offspring not 
born shortly after the normal due date (in humans, about two weeks late) 
are at great risk for stillbirth and complications, such as difficulty breathing. 
Clones tend to have very large placentas (the organ that links fetus to mother 
for oxygen and nutrition), which may contribute to their larger size, but the 
exact reason for the longer gestation periods is unclear.
 
The problem with oversize clones is so pervasive that it’s been dubbed large 
offspring syndrome, or LOS. Many offspring, including humans, produced using 
in vitro fertilization (so-called “test-tube babies”) also suffer from LOS, suggest-
ing that it’s not necessarily a problem associated with cloning. Instead, LOS 
seems to result from manipulation of the embryo. These manipulations cause 
changes in the way genes for growth are expressed (see Chapter 11 for more 
about gene expression).
Genomic imprinting occurs when genes are expressed based on which parent 
they come from. (For more on genomic imprinting, jump to the sidebar “It 
takes two to make a baby.”) In the case of LOS, what seems to happen is that 
the genes derived from the most recent male ancestor tell the fetus to grow 
faster and bigger than normal. Normally, genomic imprinting affects fewer than 
1,000 genes (out of 22,000 or so total genes in humans; see Chapter 8). How 
these “paternal” genes get turned on is anybody’s guess, but the interaction of 
sperm with egg during fertilization is likely part of the answer. The end result 
of LOS is large offspring that often suffer from a variety of birth defects and are 
at risk for certain kinds of cancer. Estimates of LOS in human children born by 
in vitro fertilization are about 5 percent. (Normally, LOS occurs in less than 1 
percent of children produced through natural fertilization.)
It takes two to make a baby
Needing a mom and a dad to make a baby 
sounds like common sense, but the wonders of 
genetic engineering suggest otherwise (after 
all, Dolly had three mothers and no father). 
Maternal and paternal DNA are required for 
successful reproduction — at least by mam-
mals — because of genomic imprinting. 
Genomic imprinting was first discovered in 
studies with mice. Researchers created mouse 
embryos with DNA from either female or male 
mice, but not both. Embryos with only pater-
nal or maternal DNA didn’t develop normally, 
indicating that both male and female DNA are 
required for successful development. In other

Developmental disasters
 
The percentage of cloning attempts that result in live births is extremely low. 
Generally, scientists must carry out hundreds of cell transfers to produce 
one offspring. Most clones perish immediately because they never implant 
into the gestation mother’s uterus. Of the embryos that do implant and begin 
development, more than half die before birth. In many cases, the placenta is 
malformed, preventing the growing fetus from obtaining proper nutrition and 
oxygen.
In most cloning attempts, two females are involved. The egg comes from 
one female and gets implanted into another female for gestation. Therefore, 
another cause of early death may be that the gestation mother rejects the 
clone as foreign. In these cases, the gestation mother’s immune system 
doesn’t recognize the embryo as her own (because it’s not) and secretes 
antibodies to destroy it. Antibodies are chemicals that the body produces to 
interact with bacteria, viruses, and foreign tissues to fight disease.
Some of the problems suffered by clones may result from the mismatch 
between mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. When an oocyte is harvested 
from a female different from the somatic cell (see the earlier section “Using 
a somatic cell nucleus to make a clone”), the egg contains roughly 100,000 
copies of the egg mother’s mitochondrial DNA. Unless the donor cell comes 
from the egg mother’s sister, the somatic cell nucleus comes from a cell with 
a different mitochondrial genome. This mismatch means that the clone isn’t 
a true clone — its DNA differs slightly from the donor. Cloned mice with 
mismatched mitochondrial and nuclear DNA tend to have decreased growth 
rates compared to cloned mice with matched mitochondrial and nuclear 
genomes.
The type of donor cell used also makes a difference in the clone’s health. 
When introduced into the oocyte, the donor cell nucleus gets “repro-
grammed” somehow to go from nullipotent to totipotent. Some cell nuclei 
seem to be better at resetting to totipotent than others. Almost all clones 
whose genomes don’t get reprogrammed perish.
studies, mice were engineered to have certain 
genes (see Chapter 19 for more on transgenic 
animals). The expression of the genes in off-
spring of the transgenic mice depended on 
which parents transmitted the genes. All off-
spring inherited the genes, but the genes were 
expressed only when the fathers transmitted 
them. Likewise, certain genes were expressed 
only when transmitted by the mothers. Thus, 
the growth and development of offspring is 
regulated by genes turned on simply because 
they come from mom or dad. Those genes then 
act in concert to regulate normal development 
of the embryo.

Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Effects of the environment
Clones are never truly exact copies of the donor organism, because genes 
interact with the environment in unique ways to form phenotypes, or physi-
cal qualities. If you’ve ever known a set of identical twins, you know that 
twins are very different from each other. Monozygotic (a fancy term for 
“identical” that literally means “one egg”) twins have different fingerprints, 
develop at different rates, have different preferences, and die at different 
times. Being genetically identical doesn’t mean they’re truly, 100 percent 
identical.
The environment’s role in development is perhaps best illustrated by experi-
ments using plants. Suppose shoots from a single plant are rooted and grown 
at different locations. In essence, the plants are clones of the parent plant. 
If genetic control were perfect, we’d expect identical plants to perform in 
identical ways, regardless of environmental conditions. However, the plants 
in our experiment grow at very different rates depending on their location. In 
other words, identical plants perform differently under different conditions. 
Likewise, genetically identical mice raised under exactly the same conditions 
don’t respond in identical ways to exactly the same doses of medications.
All organisms respond to their environment in unique and unpredictable 
ways. From the very beginning, animals experience unique conditions inside 
the womb. Hormonal exposure during pregnancy can have profound effects 
on developing organisms. For example, female piglets sandwiched between 
brothers while in the womb are more aggressive as adults than females 
that were situated between sisters. This is because male piglets secrete 
testosterone — a hormone that increases aggressive behavior.
 
Attempts to replicate organisms exactly are doomed to failure. Genetics 
doesn’t control destiny, because genes aren’t expressed in predictable ways. 
Persons carrying mutations for certain diseases don’t have a 100-percent 
probability of developing those diseases (see Chapter 13). Likewise, clones 
don’t express their genes in precisely the same way as the donor organism. 
Add the differences in mitochondrial DNA, in utero conditions (clones usually 
develop in a different womb), and time periods to the huge differences already 
present, and the only conclusion is that no clone will ever experience the 
world in precisely the same way as the donor organism did.
Fighting the Clone Wars
The arguments for and against cloning are numerous. In the sections that 
follow, I review some of the main points in both the pro and con corners. As 
you read, understand that these aren’t my opinions and arguments; I only 

311
 Chapter 20: Cloning: You’re One of a Kind
summarize what others have argued before me. I try to be balanced and fair, 
because before you can responsibly take a position on cloning, you need to 
know both sides of this controversial topic. And for more information on ethi-
cal considerations in genetics, see Chapter 21.
Arguments for cloning
Like every other scientific discovery, cloning can be used to do a lot of 
good. Cloning for medical and therapeutic purposes gives enormous hope 
that paralyzed persons will walk again and that people suffering from previ-
ously incurable conditions such as muscular dystrophy and diabetes will be 
cured. Cloning has provided scientists with some important answers about 
how genetics works. Prior to these discoveries, the changes that occur from 
embryo to adult were believed to cause permanent changes to the organ-
ism’s DNA. Now we know that’s not true. Because all DNA has the potential to 
return to totipotence, doctors have the unparalleled opportunity to correct 
genetic defects and provide treatment for devastating progressive diseases.
Another plus in the pro-cloning camp is that cloning may provide genetically 
matched organisms that will streamline research into the causes and treat-
ments of diseases such as cancer. Because matched comparisons are scien-
tifically more powerful, fewer animals are needed to conduct experiments. 
Such changes are an important advance over current research methods and 
will improve conditions for experimental animals.
Advancing knowledge of genetics can provide dramatic benefits not only to 
humans but also to the planet as a whole. Cloning may represent the last 
hope for some rare and endangered species. When only a few individuals 
remain, cloning may provide additional individuals to allow the population 
to survive. Given that the earth is experiencing its largest wave of species 
extinctions since ancient times, cloning may be a very significant advance for 
conservation biology.
Arguments against cloning
Although cloning represents an enormous opportunity, it’s an opportunity 
fraught with danger. For the first time in history, humans possess the tech-
nology to create genetically modified organisms. That capability extends not 
just to animals and plants but to humans as well. Furthermore, the genetic 
diversity that gives the natural world its rich texture is endangered by a 
unique threat — that of creating organisms that are genetically identical.

312
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
 
As I discuss in Chapter 17, genetic diversity is extremely important to estab-
lishing and maintaining the health and well-being of populations of organisms. 
Research shows that genetically diverse populations are more resilient to 
environmental stress and are better at resisting disease. Thus, creating popu-
lations of genetically similar organisms exposes all organisms to greater 
threats of disease. Lack of genetic diversity in populations of other organisms 
may ultimately expose humans to threats as well. For example, genetically 
identical crops could all fall prey to the same disease and, consequently, seri-
ously endanger food supplies (this isn’t as farfetched as it sounds). In fact, 
efforts to archive genetically diverse strains of plants are already underway 
lest unique genetic characteristics, like disease resistance, are lost.
Furthermore, cloning is fraught with problems for which no good alterna-
tives exist. For now, all cloning requires oocytes from female organisms. 
Those oocytes are obtained by first treating females with large doses of 
fertility drugs to stimulate ovulation. Such drugs stress the female’s system 
enormously and increase the rate of cell turnover in her ovaries. Some stud-
ies indicate that the drugs used for stimulating ovulation expose females to 
increased risk of ovarian cancer. And the risk doesn’t end there. When eggs 
are produced, they must be surgically removed under anesthesia. Regardless 
of the precautions, the female organism can and does experience pain. 
Animals can’t give or withhold consent, so they’re subjected to these proce-
dures whether they like it or not.
After eggs are harvested and donor cells are fused with them, development of 
an embryo begins. The vast majority of cloning attempts, regardless of their 
ultimate purpose, result in death of the embryo. Granted, these embryos 
have no nerve cells and no consciousness that scientists know of, but never-
theless, living organisms are produced with little or no hope of survival.
If clones are successfully created, their quality of life may be poor. Clones 
suffer from a myriad of disorders for which causes are unknown. They may 
age prematurely and are likely at risk for disorders that are yet unrecognized 
consequences of the methods used in the cloning process. Like the experi-
mental animals used for egg production, cloned animals can’t withhold their 
consent and withdraw from study.
The most contentious issue posed by cloning technology is the production 
of human clones. As with animals, most cloned human embryos would have 
no hope of survival. Women must consent to painful and potentially danger-
ous procedures to produce eggs, and some women must consent to carry the 
developing child and risk the emotional trauma of miscarriage or stillbirth. 
From an emotional standpoint, children created this way would be geneti-
cally identical to some other person, whether that person is living or dead. 
The pressure to be like someone else would undoubtedly be enormous. 
Further, because of the genetic similarities to some other individual, parents 
may have unrealistic expectations of their cloned offspring. Do individual 
humans have a right to genetic uniqueness? It’s a difficult question, but it’s 
one we need to answer soon, before human cloning becomes true reality.

Giving Ethical Considerations 
Their Due
In This Chapter
▶ Examining the dark side of genetics
▶ Pushing the envelope of informed consent
▶ Protecting genetic privacy
T
he field of genetics grows and changes constantly. If you follow the news, 
you’re likely to hear about several new discoveries every week. When it 
comes to genetics, the amount of information is bewildering, and the possi-
bilities are endless. If you’ve already read many of the chapters in this book, 
you have a taste of the many choices and debates created by the burgeoning 
technology surrounding our genes.
With such a fast-growing and far-reaching field as genetics, ethical questions 
and issues arise around every corner and are interconnected with the appli-
cations and procedures. Throughout this book, I highlight this interconnect-
edness. I cover animal welfare issues (in the context of cloning) in Chapter 
20. Conservation of the environment and endangered species is a key part 
of the discussion of population genetics in Chapter 17. Chapter 19 touches 
on the potential dangers — to the environment and to humans — of genetic 
engineering. Genetic counseling, including some of the issues surrounding 
prenatal testing, is the subject of Chapter 12. And in Chapter 16 I discuss 
gene therapy as an experimental form of treatment.
But I couldn’t end the discussion of genetics and your world without some 
final comments on the ethical issues that genetic advances raise. In this chap-
ter, you find out how genetics has been misunderstood, misinterpreted, and 
misused to cause people harm based on their racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic 
status. The rapidly growing field of genetics is contributing to ideas about how 
modern humans can mold the future of their offspring, so this chapter dispels 
the myth of the designer baby. You discover how information you give out and 
receive can be used for and against you. Finally, you gain a better understand-
ing of the next generation of studies based on the Human Genome Project and 
the ethical issues that mapping human genetic diversity will bring up.

Profiling Genetic Racism
One of the biggest hot button issues of all time has to be eugenics. In a nut-
shell, eugenics is the idea that humans should practice selective reproduc-
tion in an effort to “improve” the species. If you read Chapter 19, which 
explains how organisms can be genetically engineered, you probably already 
have some idea of what eugenics in the modern age may entail (transgenic, 
made-to-order babies, perhaps?). Historically, the most blatant examples of 
eugenics are genocidal activities the world over. (Perhaps the most infamous 
example occurred in Nazi Germany during the 1930s and 1940s.)
 
The story of eugenics begins with the otherwise laudable Francis Galton, 
who coined the term in 1883. (Galton is best remembered for his contribu-
tion to law enforcement: He invented the process used to identify persons by 
their fingerprints. Check out Chapter 18 for more on the genetic version of 
fingerprinting.) In direct and vocal opposition to the U.S. Constitution, Galton 
was quite sure that all men were not created equal (I emphasize here that he 
was particularly fixated on men; women were of no consequence in his day). 
Instead, Galton believed that some men were quite superior to others. To this 
end, he attempted to prove that “genius” is inherited. The view that superior 
intelligence is heritable is still widely held despite abundant evidence to the 
contrary. For example, twin studies conducted as far back as the 1930s show 
that genetically identical persons are not intellectually identical.
Galton, who was one of Charles Darwin’s cousins, gave eugenics its name, 
but his ideas weren’t unique or revolutionary. During the early 20th century, 
as understanding of Mendelian genetics (see Chapter 3) gathered steam, 
many people viewed eugenics as a highly admirable field of study. Charles 
Davenport was one such person. Davenport holds the dubious distinction 
of being the father of the American eugenics movement (one of his eugenics 
texts is subtitled “The science of human improvement by better breeding”). 
The basis of Davenport’s idea is that “degenerate” people shouldn’t repro-
duce. This notion arose from something called degeneracy theory, which 
posits that “unfit” humans acquire certain undesirable traits because of “bad 
environments” and then pass on these traits genetically. To these eugeni-
cists, unfit included “shiftlessness,” “feeblemindedness,” and poverty, among 
other things.
While the British, including Galton, advocated perpetuating good breeding 
(along with wealth and privilege), many American eugenicists focused their 
attention on preventing cacogenics, which is the erosion of genetic quality. 
Therefore, they advocated forcibly sterilizing people judged undesirable or 
merely inconvenient. Shockingly, the forcible sterilization laws of this era 
have never been overturned, and until the 1970s, it was still common practice 
to sterilize mentally ill persons without their consent — an estimated 60,000 
people in the United States suffered this atrocity. Some societies have taken 
this sick idea a step further and murdered the “unfit” in an effort to remove 
them and their genes permanently.

315
 Chapter 21: Giving Ethical Considerations Their Due
 
Sadly, violent forms of eugenics, such as genocide, rape, and forced steriliza-
tion, are still advocated and practiced all over the world. But not all forms of 
eugenics are as easy to recognize as these extreme examples. To some degree, 
eugenics lies at the heart of most of the other ethical quandaries I address in 
this chapter. In addition, it only requires a little imagination to see how gene 
therapy (Chapter 16), gene transfer (Chapter 19), or DNA fingerprinting 
(Chapter 18) can be abused to advance the cause of eugenics.
Ordering Up Designer Babies
One of the more contentious issues with a root in eugenics stems from a com-
bination of prenatal diagnosis and the fantasy of the perfect child to create a 
truly extreme makeover — designer babies. In theory, a designer baby may 
be made-to-order according to a parent’s desire for a particular sex, hair and 
eye color, and maybe even athletic ability.
The myth of designer babies
The term designer baby gets tossed around quite a bit these days. In essence, 
the term is associated with genetically made-to-order offspring. As of this 
writing, neither the technology nor sufficient knowledge of the human 
genome exists to make the designer baby a reality.
 
The fantasy of the designer baby, like cloning (see Chapter 20), rests on the 
fallacy of biological determinism (which, by the way, is what eugenics bases 
some of its lies on, too; jump back to “Profiling Genetic Racism” to find out 
about eugenics). Biological determinism assumes that genes are expressed 
in precise, repeatable ways — in other words, genetics is identity is genetics. 
However, this assumption isn’t true. Gene expression is highly dependent on 
environment, among other things (see Chapter 10 for more details about how 
gene expression works).
Furthermore, the in vitro fertilization process that plays a role in current-day 
applications of the science in question (see the next section) is a very dicey 
and difficult process at best — just ask any couple who’s gone through it in 
an effort to get pregnant. In vitro procedures are extremely expensive, inva-
sive, and painful, and women must take large quantities of strong and poten-
tially dangerous fertility medications to produce a sufficient number of eggs. 
And in the end, the majority of fertilizations don’t result in pregnancies.

The reality of the science: 
Prenatal diagnosis
So where does the myth of designer babies come from? Using procedures 
similar to those leading up to cloning (covered in Chapter 20), preimplanta-
tion genetic diagnosis, or PGD, is performed before a fertilized egg implants in 
the womb. Although it’s true that PGD opens the remote possibility of creat-
ing transgenic humans using the same technology used to create transgenic 
animals (see Chapter 19 for details), the likelihood of PGD becoming com-
monplace is extremely remote.
 
The process of PGD is technologically complicated. First, unfertilized eggs 
are harvested from a female donor. In vitro fertilization (the process to pro-
duce the so-called test-tube baby) is performed, and then the fertilized eggs 
are tested for specific gene mutations or other genetic variations. In a few 
rare cases, desperate parents have created embryos this way specifically to 
look for genetic compatibility with preexisting offspring — the plan being to 
conceive a sibling who can provide stem cells or bone marrow to save the 
life of a living sibling suffering from an otherwise untreatable disease. Saving 
the lives of living children is undoubtedly a laudable goal; the problem arises 
with what’s done with the fertilized eggs that don’t meet the desired criteria 
(if, for example, they don’t have the desired tissue match). Even if inserted 
into the mother’s uterus, the vast majority of these fertilized eggs would never 
implant and thus would not survive. Although lack of implantation is also true 
when conception occurs naturally, it’s still a very tough call to decide the fate 
of extra embryos. Options include donation to other couples, donation for 
research purposes, or destruction.
PGD and other forms of prenatal diagnosis allow parents the choice to prevent, 
alleviate, or reduce suffering (their own or someone else’s). But like deciding 
the fate of extra embryos, this is very deep and muddied water. Without get-
ting too philosophical, suffering is a highly personal experience; that is, what 
constitutes suffering to one person may look relatively okay to someone else. 
One example of relative suffering that comes up a lot is hereditary deafness. If 
a deaf couple chooses prenatal diagnosis, what’s the most desirable outcome? 
On one hand, a deaf child shares the worldview of his or her parents. On the 
other hand, a hearing child fits into the world of nondeaf people more easily. 
By now, you see how complex the issues surrounding prenatal diagnosis are. It 
seems clear that right answers, if there are any, will be very hard to come by.
Who Knows? Getting Informed Consent
Informed consent is a sticky ethical and legal issue. Basically, the idea is that 
a person can only truly make a decision about having a procedure when he 
or she is fully apprised of all the facts, risks, and benefits. Informed consent 

317
 Chapter 21: Giving Ethical Considerations Their Due
can only be given by the person receiving the procedure or by that person’s 
legal guardian. Generally, guardianship is established in cases where the 
recipient of the procedure is too young to make decisions for him or herself 
or is mentally incapacitated in some way; presumably, guardians have the 
best interests of their wards at heart.
Three major issues exist in the debate over informed consent:
 
✓ Genetic testing can be carried out on embryos, the deceased, and sam-
ples obtained from anyone during the simplest of medical procedures.
 
✓ Experimental genetic treatments (that is, gene therapies; see Chapter 16) 
have, by their very nature, unpredictable outcomes, making risk difficult 
to quantify to prospective participants.
 
✓ After tissue samples are obtained and genetic profiling is done, informa-
tion storage and privacy assurance could be problematic.
Placing restrictions on genetic testing
 
Genetic testing in the forms of DNA fingerprinting, SNP analysis (see Chapter 
18), and gene sequencing (see Chapter 11), among others, is now routine, 
fast, and relatively cheap. The testing can glean massive amounts of informa-
tion — from an individual’s sex to his or her racial and ethnic makeup — from 
even a very tiny sample of tissue. The procedure can also detect the presence 
of mutations for inherited disorders. But given that your DNA has so much 
personal information stored in it, shouldn’t you have complete control over 
whether you’re tested? The answer to this question is becoming more and 
more contentious as the definitions of, and limits to, informed consent are 
explored. The rights of persons both living and dead are at stake.
For example, the descendents of Thomas Jefferson consented to genetic test-
ing in 1998 to settle a long-standing controversy about Jefferson’s relation-
ship with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings (see Chapter 18 for the full story). 
In the Jefferson case, the matter was more than just academic curiosity 
because the right to burial in the family cemetery at Monticello was at stake.
The issue of informed consent, or lack thereof, is complicated by the abil-
ity to store tissue for long periods of time. In some cases, patients or their 
guardians gave informed consent for certain tests but didn’t include tests 
that hadn’t yet been developed. Some institutions routinely practice long-
term tissue storage, making informed consent a frequent point of contention. 
For example, a children’s hospital in Britain was taken to task over storage of 
organs that were obtained during autopsies but weren’t returned for intern-
ment with the rest of the body. Parents of the affected deceased gave consent 
for the autopsies but not for the retention of tissues.

318
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Biologists also use stored tissue to create cell-lines, living tissues that grow in 
culture tubes for research purposes. The original cell donors are often dead, 
usually from the disease under study. Cell-lines aren’t that hard to make 
and maintain (if you know what you’re doing), but the creation of cell-lines 
raises the question of whether the original donor has ownership rights to 
cells descended from his or her tissue. Cell-lines sometimes result in patents 
for lucrative treatments; should donors or their heirs get a royalty? (A court 
decision in California said no.)
Moreover, some cell-lines are developed using unfertilized human eggs, cre-
ating another ethical quandary. One type of stem cell research fuses an egg 
(that has had its nucleus removed) with an adult somatic cell in an attempt 
to create a stem cell-line that’s matched with the somatic cell donor’s tissue. 
This sort of research requires huge numbers of human eggs. In a controver-
sial move, the New York Stem Cell Foundation’s ethics committee voted to 
allow women to be paid for their eggs. Though limiting payments to com-
pensation for “time and burden,” the decision increases worries about both 
placing egg donors’ health at risk and the commercialization of human body 
parts.
Practicing safe genetic treatment
If you’ve ever had to sign a consent for treatment form, you know it can be a 
sobering experience. Almost all such forms include some phrase that commu-
nicates the possibility of death. With a gulp, most of us sign off and hope for 
the best. For routine procedures and treatments, our faith is usually repaid 
with survival. Experimental treatments are harder to gauge, though, and fully 
informing someone about possible outcomes is very difficult.
 
The 1999 case of Jesse Gelsinger (covered in Chapter 16) brought the problem 
of informed consent and experimental treatment into a glaring, harsh light. 
Jesse died after receiving an experimental treatment for a hereditary disorder 
that, by itself, wasn’t likely to kill him. His treatment took place as part of a 
clinical trial designed to assess the effects of a particular therapy in relatively 
healthy patients and to work out any difficulties before initiating treatments 
on patients for whom the disease would, without a doubt, be fatal (in this 
case, infants homozygous for the allele). What researchers knew about all the 
possible outcomes and what the Gelsinger family was told before treatment 
began is debatable.
Almost every article on gene therapy published since the Gelsinger case 
makes mention of it. In fact, most researchers in the field divide the devel-
opment of gene therapies into two categories: before and after Gelsinger. 
Sadly, Gelsinger’s death probably contributed very little to the broader 
understanding of gene therapy. Instead, the impacts of the Gelsinger case are 
that clinical trials are now harder to initiate, criteria for patient inclusion and 
exclusion are heightened, and disclosure and reporting requirements are far 

319
 Chapter 21: Giving Ethical Considerations Their Due
more stringent. These changes are basically a double-edged sword: New reg-
ulations protect patients’ rights and simultaneously decrease the likelihood 
that researchers will develop treatments to help those who desperately need 
them. Like so many ethical issues, a safe and effective solution may prove 
elusive.
Keeping it private
Another issue in the informed consent debate relates to privacy. When 
genetic tests are conducted, the data recorded often includes detailed medi-
cal histories and other personal information, all of which aids researchers or 
physicians in the interpretation of the genetic data obtained. So far, so good. 
But what happens to all that information? Who sees it? Where’s it stored? 
And for how long?
Privacy is a big deal, particularly in American culture. Laws exist to protect 
one’s private medical information, financial status, and juvenile criminal 
records (if any). Individuals are protected from unwarranted searches and 
surveillance, and they have the right to exclude unwanted persons from their 
private property. Genetic information is likely to fall under existing medical 
privacy laws, but there’s one twist: Genetic information contains an element 
of the future, not just the past.
 
When you carry a mutation for susceptibility to breast cancer, you have a 
greater likelihood of developing breast cancer than someone who doesn’t 
have the allele (see Chapter 14). A breast cancer allele doesn’t guarantee 
you’ll develop the cancer, though; it just increases the probability. If you were 
to be tested for the breast cancer allele and found to have it, that information 
would become part of your medical record. Besides your doctor and appropri-
ate medical personnel, who might learn about your condition? Your insurance 
company, that’s who. So far, situations like this haven’t presented a big prob-
lem because few people have had genetic tests. Many genetic tests are often 
expensive and aren’t part of routine healthcare, but as technology advances 
and gets cheaper (like microarrays; see Chapter 23), genetic testing is likely to 
become more common. And that shift may be both a blessing and a curse.
As a patient, knowing that you have a genetic mutation is a really good thing, 
because the condition may be treatable, or an early detection screening may 
help you prevent more serious complications. For example, cancers that are 
caught early have far better prognoses than those diagnosed in later stages. 
However, knowing about a genetic mutation may give insurance companies 
the chance to issue or cancel policies, thus unfairly limiting your access to 
healthcare or employment. Sadly, at least one employer has been caught 
attempting to test workers for genetic predispositions to certain injuries (in 
this case, carpal tunnel syndrome, a repetitive stress injury to the hands and 
arms) without the employees’ knowledge — clearly, a violation of informed 
consent.

320
Part IV: Genetics and Your World 
Genetic privacy issues also feed into the controversies surrounding the 
Human Genome Project and efforts to characterize human population genet-
ics. Critics fear that if certain mutations or health problems are genetically 
linked to groups of people, discrimination and bias will result. Fortunately, 
lawmakers are taking steps to protect you and your genetic privacy. In 
2008, former U.S. President George W. Bush signed the Genetic Information 
Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which prohibits both health insurance compa-
nies and employers from discriminating against someone based on informa-
tion from genetic testing. In addition, most state legislatures have enacted 
similar laws.
Genetic Property Rights
According to U.S. law, a patent gives the patent owner exclusive rights to 
manufacture and sell his or her invention for a certain length of time (usu-
ally 20 years). That may not sound like a big deal, but what makes patents 
scary is that companies are patenting genes — DNA sequences that hold the 
instructions for life. And it’s not just any genes, either. They’re patenting your 
genes.
 
Patents are granted to inventors, but the people (or companies) holding 
gene patents didn’t invent the genes that naturally occur in living organisms. 
According to most legal experts, genes are “unpatentable products of nature.” 
Yet so far, American and European patenting authorities have viewed genes 
in the same legal light as manmade chemicals. Generally, patent-holding com-
panies sequence the genes and convert them to another form called cDNA (c 
means complementary; see Chapter 16 for coverage of translation). Then they 
seek a patent on the cDNA rather than the gene itself. Another approach to the 
patenting process is that the company discovers a gene (or a disease-causing 
version of it) and then invents products such as diagnostic tests that have 
something to do with the gene.
Just how a company can own and exercise exclusive rights over your genes is 
a little hard to understand. An example of how gene patenting works comes 
from the invention of the process of PCR (see Chapter 22 for the whole 
tale). The process uses an enzyme that’s produced by a very special sort 
of bacteria. The gene that codes for that enzyme (called Taq polymerase) 
is easily moved into other bacteria, such as E. coli, using recombinant DNA 
techniques (explained in Chapter 16). This means that E. coli can produce 
the enzyme that can then be used to run PCR. But if any other geneticist uses 
that gene to make Taq polymerase, a royalty must be paid to the company 
that patented it. Not surprisingly, this company is now the biggest manufac-
turer of Taq in the world, raking in profits in the billions of dollars.

321
 Chapter 21: Giving Ethical Considerations Their Due
Here are examples of how ugly the gene-patenting game can get:
 
✓ In 2001, an American company got a European patent for BRCA1, one 
of the breast cancer genes (see Chapter 14 for a full description of this 
mutation). A mutation in this gene can lead to cancer, and presumably, 
no one would want to purchase a case of breast cancer. So why patent 
it? Because the company holding the patent can charge large sums to 
test people to determine whether they carry the mutation.
 
✓ A large drug company holds a patent on a gene test that can determine 
whether the company’s product will work for certain persons. The com-
pany refuses to actually develop the test or let anyone else have a crack 
at it because doing so may reduce sales of the medication in question.
 
✓ Companies patent disease-causing bacteria and viral genes for the same 
reasons — to block diagnosis and treatment — until a hefty licensing fee 
has been paid.
Such use of genetic patents impedes both research to combat disease and 
access to healthcare. Because of these kinds of manipulations, gene patents 
are beginning to meet with strong and vocal opposition.
Gene-patenting policies may endanger your health in other ways as well.
 
✓ When commercial outfits get genetic information, they treat it as their per-
sonal property. Therefore, they don’t always report gene sequences and 
experiment results in the appropriate scientific literature (thus avoiding 
review and verification by experts in the field). To market their products, 
these companies must go through the regulatory process mandated by 
the government to ensure consumer safety, but that regulatory review 
process has suffered noticeable shortcomings of late — particularly 
when products are allowed to pass muster while some conflict of interest 
is at work (think stock options, as was the case in shake-ups at the U.S. 
National Institutes of Health in 2005).
 
✓ Sadly, universities have gotten in on the act. In one instance, the search 
for the genes responsible for autism was held up because several uni-
versities refused to share information with, of all people, the parents of 
autistic children. Each university wanted to be the first to (you guessed 
it) patent the “autism gene.” As a result, an independent foundation was 
established to create a public repository for genetic information about 
autism, because such actions are a direct assault on the openness of the 
scientific research itself.
The days of gene patents may be numbered, however. In 2009, cancer patient 
Genae Girard, along with four other patients, genetics researchers, and 
others, filed suit against a company that owns the patent on two genes asso-
ciated with breast cancer risk. If their challenge is successful, restrictions on 
testing and other sorts of research could be lifted, paving the way to more 
open exchange of knowledge and lowering the costs of testing.

enetics is equal parts great history and amazing 
future. The discoveries of the past depended on the 
genius of many individuals. Likewise, the marvels of the 
future will be shaped by teams of researchers and 
entrepreneurs.
This part exposes you to genetics’ past and allows you to 
glimpse its future as well. I introduce you to the ten most 
important people and events that shaped what genetics is 
today, and I explain the next big things (or ten of them, at 
least) on the genetics horizon. Finally, I shake things up 
with ten hard-to-believe (and all true!) genetics stories.

Chapter 22
Ten Defining Events in Genetics
In This Chapter

▶ Highlighting the people behind great discoveries
M
any milestones define the history of genetics. This chapter focuses on 
nine that I don’t cover in other chapters of the book and one that I do 
(the Human Genome Project is so important that I cover it in Chapter 8 and here, 
too). The events listed here appear roughly in order of historical occurrence.
The Publication of Darwin’s 
“The Origin of Species”
Earthquakes have aftershocks — little mini-earthquakes that rattle around 
after the main quake. Events in history sometimes cause aftershocks, too. 
The publication of one man’s life’s work is such an event. From the moment 
it hit the shelves in 1856, Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species was deeply 
controversial (and still is).
The basis of evolution is elegantly simple: Individual organisms vary in their 
ability to survive and reproduce. For example, a sudden cold snap occurs, 
and most individuals of a certain bird species die because they can’t tolerate 
the rapid drop in temperature. But individuals of the same species that can 
tolerate the unexpected freeze survive and reproduce. As long as the abil-
ity to deal with rapid temperature drops is heritable, the trait is passed to 
future generations, and more and more individuals inherit it. When groups 
of individuals are isolated from each other, they wind up being subjected 
to different sorts of events (such as weather patterns). After many, many 
years, stepwise changes in the kinds of traits that individuals inherit based 
on events like a sudden freeze accumulate to the point that populations with 
common ancestors become separate species.

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Darwin concluded that all life on earth is related by inheritance in this fash-
ion and thus has a common origin. Darwin arrived at his conclusions after 
years of studying plants and animals all over the world. What he lacked was 
a convincing explanation for how individuals inherit advantageous traits. Yet 
the explanation was literally at his fingertips. Gregor Mendel figured out the 
laws of inheritance at about the same time that Darwin was working on his 
book (see Chapter 3). Apparently, Darwin failed to read Mendel’s paper — he 
scrawled notes on the papers immediately preceding and following Mendel’s 
paper but left Mendel’s unmarked. Darwin’s copious notes show no evidence 
that he was even aware of Mendel’s work.
 
Even without knowledge of how inheritance works, Darwin accurately summa-
rized three principles that are confirmed by genetics:
 
✓ Variation is random and unpredictable. Studies of mutation confirm 
this principle (see Chapter 13).
 
✓ Variation is heritable (it can be passed on from one generation to 
the next). Mendel’s own research — and thousands of studies over the 
past century — confirms heritability. With DNA fingerprinting, heritable 
genetic variation can be traced directly from parent to offspring (see 
Chapter 18 for how paternity tests use heritable genetic markers to 
determine which male fathered which child).
 
✓ Variation changes in frequency over the course of time. The Hardy-
Weinberg principle formalized this concept in the form of population 
genetics in the early 1900s (see Chapter 17). Since the 1970s, genetic 
studies using DNA sequencing (along with other methods) have con-
firmed that genetic variation within populations changes because of 
mutation, accidents, and geographic isolation, to name only a few 
causes.
Regardless of how you view it, the publication of Darwin’s The Origin of 
Species is pivotal in the history of genetics. If no genetic variation existed, all 
life on earth would be precisely identical. Variation gives the world its rich 
texture and complexity, and it’s what makes you wonderfully unique.
The Rediscovery of Mendel’s Work
In 1866, Gregor Mendel wrote a summary of the results of his gardening 
experiments with peas (which I detail in Chapter 3). His work was pub-
lished in the scientific journal Versuche Pflanzen Hybriden, where it gathered 
dust for nearly 40 years. Although Mendel wasn’t big on self-promotion, he 
sent copies of his paper to two well-known scientists of his time. One copy 
remains missing; the other was found in what amounts to an unopened enve-
lope — the pages were never cut. (Old printing practices resulted in pages 

327
 Chapter 22: Ten Defining Events in Genetics
being folded together; the only way to read the paper was to cut the pages 
apart.) Thus, despite the fact that his findings were published and distrib-
uted (though limitedly), his peers didn’t grasp the magnitude of Mendel’s 
discovery.
 
Mendel’s work went unnoticed until three botanists — Hugo de Vries, Erich 
von Tschermak, and Carl Correns — all reinvented Mendel’s wheel, so to 
speak. These three men conducted experiments that were very similar to 
Mendel’s. Their conclusions were identical — all three “discovered” the laws 
of heredity. De Vries found Mendel’s work referenced in a paper published 
in 1881. (De Vries coined the term mutation, by the way.) The author of the 
1881 paper, a man by the unfortunate name of Focke, summarized Mendel’s 
findings but didn’t have a clue as to their significance. De Vries correctly inter-
preted Mendel’s work and cited it in his own paper, which was published in 
1900. Shortly thereafter, Tschermak and Correns also discovered Mendel’s 
publication through de Vries’s published works and indicated that their own 
independent findings confirmed Mendel’s conclusions as well.
William Bateson is perhaps the great hero of this story. He was already 
incredibly influential by the time he read de Vries’s paper citing Mendel, and 
unlike many around him, he recognized that Mendel’s laws of inheritance 
were revolutionary and absolutely correct. Bateson became an ardent voice 
spreading the word. He coined the terms genetics, allele (shortened from 
the original allelomorph), homozygote, and heterozygote. Bateson was also 
responsible for the discovery of linkage (see Chapter 4), which was experi-
mentally confirmed later by Morgan and Bridges.
The Transforming Principle
 
Frederick Griffith wasn’t working to discover DNA. The year was 1928, and the 
memory of the deadly flu epidemic of 1918 was still fresh in everyone’s mind. 
Griffith was studying pneumonia in an effort to prevent future epidemics. He 
was particularly interested in why some strains of bacteria cause illness and 
other seemingly identical strains do not. To get to the bottom of the issue, 
he conducted a series of experiments using two strains of the same species 
of bacteria, Streptococcus pneumonia. The two strains looked very different 
when grown in a Petri dish, because one grew a smooth carpet and the other a 
lumpy one (he called it “rough”). When Griffith injected smooth bacteria into 
mice, they died; rough bacteria, on the other hand, were harmless.
To figure out why one strain of bacteria was deadly and the other wasn’t, 
Griffith conducted a series of experiments. He injected some mice with heat-
killed smooth bacteria (which turned out to be harmless) and others with 
heat-killed smooth in combination with living rough bacteria. This combo 

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
proved deadly to the mice. Griffith quickly figured out that something in the 
smooth bacteria transformed rough bacteria into a killer. But what? For lack 
of anything better, he called the responsible factor the transforming principle 
(which now sounds like a good title for a diet book).
Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin MacLeod teamed up in the 1940s 
to discover that Griffith’s transforming principle was actually DNA. This 
trio made the discovery by a dogged process of elimination. They showed 
that fats and proteins don’t do the trick; only the DNA of smooth bacteria 
provides live rough bacteria with the needed ingredient to get nasty. Their 
results were published in 1944, and like Mendel’s work nearly a century 
before, their findings were largely rejected.
It wasn’t until Erwin Chargaff came along that the transforming principle 
started to get the appreciation it deserved. Chargaff was so impressed that 
he changed his entire research focus to DNA. Chargaff eventually determined 
the ratios of bases in DNA that helped lead to Watson and Crick’s momen-
tous discovery of DNA’s double helix structure (flip to Chapter 6 for all the 
details).
The Discovery of Jumping Genes
By all accounts, Barbara McClintock was both brilliant and a little odd; a 
friend once described her as “not fooled or foolable.” McClintock was unorth-
odox in both her research and her outlook as she lived and worked alone for 
most of her life. Her career began in the early 1930s and took her into a man’s 
world — very few women worked in the sciences in her day.
 
In 1931, McClintock collaborated with another woman, Harriet Creighton, to 
demonstrate that genes are located on chromosomes. This fact sounds so 
self-evident now, but back then, it was a revolutionary idea. Creighton and 
McClintock showed that corn chromosomes recombine during meiosis (see 
Chapter 2 for the scoop on meiosis). By tracking the inheritance of various 
traits, they figured out which genes were getting moved during translocation 
events (see Chapter 15). Translocations hook up chunks of chromosomes in 
places where they don’t belong. Chromosomes with translocations look very 
different from normal chromosomes, making it easy to track their inheritance. 
By linking physical traits to certain parts of one odd-looking chromosome, 
Creighton and McClintock demonstrated that crossover events between chro-
mosomes move genes from one chromosome to another.
McClintock’s contribution to genetics goes beyond locating genes on chro-
mosomes, though. She also discovered traveling bits of DNA, sometimes 
known as jumping genes (see Chapter 11 for more). In 1948, McClintock, 
working independently, published her results demonstrating that certain 
genes of corn could hop around from one chromosome to another without 

329
 Chapter 22: Ten Defining Events in Genetics
translocation. Her announcement triggered little reaction at first. It’s not 
that people thought McClintock was wrong; she was just so far ahead of the 
curve that her fellow geneticists couldn’t comprehend her findings. Alfred 
Sturtevant (who was responsible for the discovery of gene mapping) once 
said, “I didn’t understand one word she said, but if she says it is so, it must 
be so!”
It took nearly 40 years before the genetics world caught up with Barbara 
McClintock and awarded her the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 
in 1983. By then, jumping genes had been discovered in many organisms 
(including humans). Feisty to the end, this grand dame of genetics passed 
away in 1992 at the age of 90.
The Birth of DNA Sequencing
So many events in the history of genetics lay a foundation for other events to 
follow. Federick Sanger’s invention of chain-reaction DNA sequencing (which 
I cover in Chapter 8) is one of those foundational events. In 1980, Sanger 
shared his second Nobel Prize (in Chemistry) with Walter Gilbert for their 
work on DNA. Sanger had already earned a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1958 
for his pioneering work on the structure of the protein insulin. (Insulin is 
produced by your pancreas and regulates blood sugar; its absence results in 
diabetes.)
 
Sanger figured out the entire process used for DNA sequencing. Every single 
genetics project that has anything to do with DNA uses Sanger’s method. 
Chain-reaction sequencing, as Sanger’s method is called, uses the same 
mechanics as replication in your cells (see Chapter 7 for a rundown of replica-
tion). Sanger figured out that he could control the DNA building process by 
snipping off one oxygen molecule from the building blocks of DNA. The result-
ing method allowed identification of every base, in order, along a DNA strand, 
sparking a revolution in the understanding of how your genes work. This 
process is responsible for the Human Genome Project, DNA fingerprinting 
(see Chapter 18), genetic engineering (see Chapter 19), and gene therapy (see 
Chapter 16).
The Invention of PCR
In 1985, while driving along a California highway in the middle of the night, 
Kary Mullis had a brainstorm about how to carry out DNA replication in a 
tube (see Chapter 7 for the scoop on replication). His idea led to the inven-
tion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a pivotal point in the history of 
genetics.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
I detail the entire process of how PCR is used in DNA fingerprinting in 
Chapter 18. In essence, PCR acts like a copier for DNA. Even the tiniest snip-
pet of DNA can be copied. This concept is important because, so far, tech-
nology isn’t sophisticated enough to examine one DNA molecule at a time. 
Scientists need many copies of the same molecule before enough is present 
for them to detect and study. Without PCR, large amounts of DNA are needed 
to generate a DNA fingerprint, but at many crime scenes, only tiny amounts 
of DNA are present. PCR is the powerful tool that every crime lab in the coun-
try now uses to detect the DNA left behind at crime scenes and to generate 
DNA fingerprints.
Mullis’s bright idea turned into a billion dollar industry. Although he report-
edly was paid a paltry $10,000 for his invention, he received the Nobel Prize 
for Chemistry in 1993 (a sort of consolation prize).
The Development of Recombinant 
DNA Technology
 
In 1970, Hamilton O. Smith discovered restriction enzymes, which act as chemi-
cal cleavers to chop DNA into pieces at very specific sequences. As part of 
other research, Smith put bacteria and a bacteria-attacking virus together. The 
bacteria didn’t go down without a fight — instead, it produced an enzyme that 
chopped the viral DNA into pieces, effectively destroying the invading virus 
altogether. Smith determined that the enzyme, now known as HindII (named 
for the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae Rd), cuts DNA every time it finds cer-
tain bases all in a row and cuts between the same two bases every time.
This fortuitous (and completely accidental!) discovery was just what was 
needed to spark a revolution in the study of DNA. Some restriction enzymes 
make offset cuts in DNA, leaving single-stranded ends. The single-strand bits of 
DNA allow geneticists to “cut-and-paste” pieces of DNA together in novel ways, 
forming the entire basis of what’s now known as recombinant DNA technology.
 
Gene therapy (see Chapter 16), the creation of genetically engineered organ-
isms (see Chapter 19), and practically every other advance in the field of 
genetics these days all depend on the ability to cut DNA into pieces without 
disabling the genes and then to put the genes into new places — a feat made 
possible thanks to restriction enzymes.
Today, researchers use thousands of restriction enzymes to help map genes 
on chromosomes, determine the function of genes, and manipulate DNA 
for diagnosis and treatment of disease. Smith shared the Nobel Prize in 
Physiology or Medicine in 1978 with two other geneticists, Dan Nathans and 
Werner Arber, for their joint contributions to the discovery of restriction 
enzymes.

 Chapter 22: Ten Defining Events in Genetics
The Invention of DNA Fingerprinting
Sir Alec Jeffreys has put thousands of wrongdoers behind bars. Almost 
single-handedly, he’s also set hundreds of innocent people free from prison. 
Not bad for a guy who spends most of his time in the genetics lab.
Jeffreys invented DNA fingerprinting in 1985. By examining the patterns made 
by human DNA after it was diced up by restriction enzymes, Jeffreys real-
ized that every person’s DNA produces a slightly different number of various 
sized fragments (which number in the thousands).
 
Jeffreys’s invention has seen a number of refinements since its inception. PCR 
and the use of STRs (short tandem repeats; see Chapter 18) have replaced the 
use of restriction enzymes. Modern methods of DNA fingerprinting are highly 
repeatable and extremely accurate, meaning that a DNA fingerprint can be 
stored much like a fingerprint impression from your fingertip. More than 100 
laboratories in the United States alone now make use of the methods that 
Jeffreys pioneered. The information that these labs generate is housed in a 
huge database hosted by the FBI, granting any police department quick access 
to data that can help match criminals to crimes.
In 1994, Queen Elizabeth II knighted Jeffreys for his contributions to law 
enforcement and his accomplishments in genetics.
The Explanation of Developmental 
Genetics
As I explain in Chapter 8, every cell in your body has a full set of genetic 
instructions to make all of you. The master plan of how an entire organ-
ism is built from genetic instructions remained a mystery until 1980, when 
Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus identified the genes that 
control the whole body plan during fly development.
Fruit flies and other insects are constructed of interlocking pieces, or seg-
ments. A group of genes (collectively called segmentation genes) tells the 
cells which body segments go where. These genes, along with others, give 
directions like top and bottom and front and back, as well as the order of 
body regions in between. Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus made their dis-
covery by mutating genes and looking for the effects of the “broken” genes. 
When segmentation genes get mutated, the fly ends up lacking whole sec-
tions of important body parts or certain pairs of organs.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A different set of genes (called homeotic genes) controls the placement of 
all the fly’s organs and appendages, such as wings, legs, eyes, and so on. 
One such gene is eyeless. Contrary to what would seem logical, eyeless actu-
ally codes for normal eye development. Using the same recombinant DNA 
techniques made possible by restriction enzymes (see the section “The 
Development of Recombinant DNA Technology” earlier in the chapter), 
Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus moved eyeless to different chromosomes 
where it could be turned on in cells in which it was normally turned off. The 
resulting flies grew eyes in all sorts of strange locations — on their wings, 
legs, butts, you name it. This research showed that, working together, 
segmentation and homeotic genes put all the parts in all the right places. 
Humans have versions of these genes, too; your body-plan genes were dis-
covered by comparing fruit fly genes to human DNA (see Chapter 8 for how 
the genomes of organisms affect you).
The Work of Francis Collins and 
the Human Genome Project
 
In 1989, Francis Collins and Lap-Chee Tsui identified the single gene respon-
sible for cystic fibrosis. The very next year, the Human Genome Project 
(HGP) officially got underway. A double-doctor (that is, a doc with an MD 
and PhD), Collins later replaced James Watson as the head of the National 
Human Genome Research Institute in the United States and supervised the 
race to sequence the entire human genome from start to finish. In 2009, Collins 
became the director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.
Collins is one of the true heroes of modern genetics. He kept the HGP ahead 
of schedule and under budget. He continues to champion the right to free 
access to all the HGP data, making him a courageous opponent of gene pat-
ents and other practices that restrict access to discovery and healthcare, 
and he’s a staunch defender of genetic privacy (see Chapter 21 for more on 
these subjects). Although the human genome is still bits and pieces away 
from being completely sequenced, the project wouldn’t have been a success 
without the tireless work of Collins, who’s still an active gene hunter. His lab 
is now searching out the genes responsible for adult-onset diabetes.

Ten Hot Issues in Genetics
In This Chapter
▶ Tracking potential advances in medicine and aging
▶ Continuing research on stem cells and antibiotic resistance
▶ Identifying the DNA bar codes of living things
G
enetics is a field that grows and changes with every passing day. The 
hottest journals in the field (Nature and Science) are full of new discov-
eries each and every week. This chapter shines the spotlight on ten of the 
hottest topics and next big things in this ever-changing scientific landscape.
Personalized Medicine
The fourth biggest cause of death in the United States is adverse reactions 
to medications. Up to 100,000 people die each year from something that’s 
meant to help them. Why? The tool scientists use to answer that question is 
pharmacogenomics, the analysis of the human genome and heredity to deter-
mine how drugs work in individual people. The idea is that the reason certain 
people have adverse reactions to certain drugs and others don’t lies some-
where in their DNA. If researchers could develop a simple test to detect these 
DNA differences, doctors would never prescribe the wrong drugs in the first 
place. (Oddly, this idea sometimes doesn’t go over well with drug companies; 
for more on the connection between the two, check out Chapter 21.) The 
overarching goal of personalized medicine is a new brand of care that can be 
designed to fit the unique genetic makeup of each individual patient.
That’s the good news. The bad news is that nobody knows how many genes 
are involved in diseases, and many genes can cause the same disease. Not 
only that, but epigenetics (flip to Chapter 4 to find out more about epi-
genetics) further complicates matters by turning genes on and off in unex-
pected ways. All this adds up to more confusion and fewer genetics-based 
treatments, meaning that the promises of personalized medicine may wind 
up being slow, or impossible, to realize.

334
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Stem Cell Research
Stem cells may hold the key to curing brain and spinal cord injuries. They 
may be part of the cure for cancer. These little wonders may be the magic 
bullet to solving all sorts of medical problems, but they’re at the center of 
controversies so big that their potential remains untested.
Stem cells are hot research topics because they’re totipotent. Totipotence 
means that stem cells can turn into any kind of tissue, from brain to muscle 
to bone, just to name a few. Not too surprisingly, stem cells are what undif-
ferentiated embryos are made of; that is, a fertilized egg, shortly after it 
starts dividing, is composed entirely of stem cells. At a certain point during 
development, all the cells get their assignments, and totipotence is long gone 
(except for DNA, which retains surprising flexibility — DNA’s totipotence is 
what allows cloning to work; see Chapter 20).
You’ve probably guessed (or already knew) that the source of stem cells for 
research is embryonic tissue — and therein lies the rub. As of this writing, 
researchers haven’t found a way to harvest stem cells without sacrificing the 
embryo in the process. They can collect stem cells from adults (from vari-
ous places, including blood), but adult stem cells lack some of the totipotent 
potential of embryonic cells and are present in very low numbers, which 
makes using adult stem cells problematic. Nonetheless, adult stem cells 
may work better than embryonic ones for therapeutic purposes, because 
researchers can harvest them from a patient, modify them, and return them 
to the patient, eliminating the chance of tissue rejection. (For the lowdown 
on gene therapy, see Chapter 16.) A potential compromise may be collect-
ing the cells from an umbilical cord after a child is born; these cells are even 
better than adult stem cells. Stem cells in one form or another may yet find 
their way into modern medicine, but for now, moral and ethical opposition 
to the use of embryonic cells stymies stem cell research because most of it 
depends on the use of embryonic tissues.
Aging Genes
Aging is not for the timid. Skin sags, hair turns gray, joints hurt. Sounds like 
fun, doesn’t it? The effects may be obvious, but the process of senescence 
(the fancy term for aging) is still quite a mystery. Scientists know that the 
ends of your chromosomes (called telomeres) sometimes get shorter as you 
get older (see Chapter 7), but they aren’t sure that those changes are what 
make old folks old. What is known is that when telomeres get too short, cells 
die, and cell death is clearly part of the aging process.

335
 Chapter 23: Ten Hot Issues in Genetics
The enzyme that can prevent telomeres from shortening, telomerase (see 
Chapter 7), seems an obvious target for anti-aging research. Cells that have 
active telomerase don’t die because of shortened telomeres. For instance, 
cancer cells often have active telomerase when normal cells don’t; telomer-
ase activity contributes to the unwanted longevity that cancer cells enjoy 
(flip to Chapter 14 for the details). If geneticists can get a handle on telomer-
ase — turning it on where it’s wanted without causing cancer — aging may 
become controllable.
In addition, geneticists have discovered that old cells perk up when put in 
the company of younger cells. This finding indicates that cells have plenty 
of capacity to regenerate themselves — they just need a little incentive. 
Another recent study suggests that calorie restriction in a person’s diet also 
helps defer the effects of aging. Researchers found that when mice were put 
on a calorie-restricted diet, a gene kicked in to slow programmed cell death 
(called apoptosis; see Chapter 14).
New information on how to prevent aging is in high demand. If keeping young 
turns out to be as simple as spending time with younger people and eating 
less, aging may be a lot more fun than it seems.
Proteomics
Genomics, the study of whole genomes, will soon have to make room for the 
next big thing: proteomics, the study of all the proteins an organism makes. 
Proteins do all the work in your body. They carry out all the functions that 
genes encode, so when a gene mutation occurs, the protein is what winds up 
being altered (or goes missing altogether). Given the link between genes and 
proteins, the study of proteins may end up telling researchers more about 
genes than the genes themselves!
Proteins are three-dimensional (see Chapter 9 for an explanation). Proteins 
not only get folded into complex shapes but also get hooked up with other 
proteins and decorated with other elements such as metals. (See Chapter 9 
for more on how proteins are modified from plain amino acid chains to get 
gussied up to do their jobs.) Currently, scientists can’t just look at a protein 
and tell what its function is. If it’s possible to decode them, though, proteins 
may be a big deal in the fields of medical drugs and treatments, because 
medications act upon the proteins in your system.
Cataloging all the proteins in your proteome hasn’t been easy, because 
researchers have to sample every tissue to find them all. Nonetheless, the 
rewards of discovering new drugs and treatments for previously untreatable 
diseases may make the effort worthwhile. Like personalized medicine, how-
ever, proteomics hasn’t made a big splash in clinical settings just yet — 
complexities and technological setbacks have slowed progress.

Bioinformatics
You live in the information age, with practically everything you need at your 
fingertips. But where genetics is concerned, it’s the information overflow 
age — thousands and thousands of DNA sequences, gobs of proteins, tons of 
data. It’s hard to know where to start or how to sort through the mountains 
of chatter to get to the real messages. Never fear! Bioinformatics For Dummies 
is here! (I’m not kidding. It’s a real For Dummies title. For specifics, check out 
www.dummies.com.)
 
Bioinformatics is the process of using a computer to sort through massive 
biological databases. Anyone with an Internet connection can access these 
databases with the click of a mouse (surf to www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov to 
reach the National Center for Biotechnology Information). Hop online and you 
can search all the results of the entire Human Genome Project, check out the 
latest gene maps, and look up anything about any disease that has a genetic 
basis.
Not only that, but bioinformatics gives you ready access to powerful analyti-
cal tools — the kind the pros use. Gene hunters use these tools to compare 
human DNA sequences with those in other animals (see Chapter 8 for a 
rundown of critters whose DNA has been sequenced). As one of the next big 
things in genetics, bioinformatics provides the tools to catalog, keep track of, 
and analyze all the data generated by geneticists the world over. This data is 
then used for all the applications I cover in this book — from genetic counsel-
ing to cloning and beyond.
Gene Chips
Technology is at the heart of modern genetics, and one of the most useful 
developments in genetic technology is the gene chip. Also known as microar-
rays, gene chips allow researchers to quickly determine which genes are at 
work (that is, being expressed) in a given cell (see Chapter 11 for a full run-
down on how your genes do their jobs).
 
Gene expression depends on messenger RNA (mRNA), which is produced 
through transcription (see Chapter 9). The mRNAs get tidied up and sent out 
into the cell cytoplasm to be translated into proteins (see Chapter 10 for how 
translation works to make proteins). The various mRNAs in each cell tell how 
many and exactly which of the thousands of genes are at work at any given 
moment. In addition, the number of copies of each mRNA conveys an index of 
the strength of gene expression (see Chapter 11 for more on gene expression). 
The more copies of a particular mRNA, the stronger the action of the gene that 
produced it.

337
 Chapter 23: Ten Hot Issues in Genetics
Gene chips are grids composed of bits of DNA that are complementary to the 
mRNAs the geneticist expects to find in a cell (I explain the method used to 
detect the mRNAs in the first place in Chapter 16). It works like this: The bits 
of DNA are attached to a glass slide. All the mRNAs from a cell are passed 
over the gene chip, and the mRNAs bind to their DNA complements on the 
slide. Geneticists measure how many copies of a given mRNA attach them-
selves to any given spot on the slide to determine which genes are active and 
what their strength is.
Gene chips are relatively inexpensive to make and can each test hundreds of 
different mRNAs, making them a valuable tool for gene discovery and map-
ping. Scientists are also using microarrays to screen thousands of genes 
rapidly to pick up on mutations that cause diseases, as well as chromosome 
abnormalities (like those I describe in Chapter 15). One way they perform 
this screening is by comparing mRNAs from normal cells to those from dis-
eased cells (such as cancer). By comparing the genes that are turned on or 
off in the two cell types, geneticists can determine what’s gone wrong and 
how the disease may be treated.
Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance
Unfortunately, not all “next big things” are good. Antibiotics are used to fight 
diseases caused by bacteria. When penicillin (a common antibiotic) was 
developed, it was a wonder drug that saved thousands and thousands of 
lives. However, many antibiotics are nearly useless now because of the evolu-
tion of antibiotic resistance.
 
Bacteria don’t have sex, but they still pass their genes around. They achieve 
this feat by passing around little circular bits of DNA called plasmids. Almost 
any species of bacteria can pass its plasmids on to any other species. Thus, 
when bacteria that are resistant to a particular antibiotic run into bacteria that 
aren’t resistant, the exchange of plasmids endows the formerly susceptible 
bacteria with antibiotic resistance. Antibacterial soaps and the overprescrib-
ing of antibiotics make the situation worse by killing off all the nonresistant 
bacteria, leaving only the resistant kind behind.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are showing up not only in hospitals but also 
in natural environments. Farmers pump their animals full of antibiotics in 
an effort to keep them free from disease. Thus, antibiotic-resistant bacteria 
abound in farm sewage, and eventually, the runoff ends up in lakes, streams, 
and rivers that provide drinking water for humans. Many of those bacteria 
cause human diseases, and because they start off as antibiotic-resistant bac-
teria, treating illnesses that they cause is difficult. Meanwhile, scientists work 
to develop new, more powerful antibiotics in an effort to stay one step ahead 
of the bacteria.

Genetics of Infectious Disease
I’m guessing that you’re too young to remember the flu epidemic of 1918 (I 
certainly am!). My aunt, who was a schoolteacher in 1918, told me that half 
the students at her tiny, rural Louisiana school died, along with the school’s 
other teacher. All told, 20 million people worldwide died of the flu in that hor-
rific epidemic. The virus was so deadly that people caught it in the morning 
and died the same day!
A frightening descendent of the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic is still 
around. Swine flu turned into a global pandemic in June 2009, affecting thou-
sands of people around the world. Fortunately, this new virus, known as 
H1N1, is not as severe as its predecessor, causing only acute illness in most 
cases.
 
Influenza viruses frequently start out as bird diseases (usually carried in the 
guts of domestic poultry) that move from birds to a new host. Flu viruses pull 
off this transformation by picking up new genes from the DNA of their hosts 
or from other viruses. This means that the flu viruses are constantly evolving, 
changing their surface proteins to allow invasion into new hosts (like pigs and 
humans) and new organ systems (like airways and lungs).
The 2009 swine flu possesses genes from two different pig flu viruses (that 
is, viruses that cause influenza in the pigs themselves). Pigs are unusual in 
that they can contract flu from humans, birds, and one another. After they’re 
infected, pig cells are capable of simultaneously hosting multiple viruses, 
which allows the viruses to acquire new genes very easily. It’s not clear how 
this swine flu made the jump to humans, though, because pig-to-person trans-
mission is very rare.
Bioterrorism
After September 11, 2001, terrorism moved to the forefront of many people’s 
mind. Hot on the heels of the disaster in New York City was another threat 
in the form of anthrax-laced letters. (Anthrax is a deadly disease caused by 
a soil bacterium.) Opening junk mail in the United States went from merely 
annoying to potentially threatening.
Anthrax and other infectious organisms are potential weapons that can 
be used by terrorists — a form of warfare called bioterror. Suddenly, the 
researchers working on anthrax genetics — people who had toiled away in 
underfunded obscurity — were national treasures. U.S. government spend-
ing on efforts to counter the bioterror threat shot up. Since 2001, the United 

339
 Chapter 23: Ten Hot Issues in Genetics
States has spent roughly $50 billion on biodefense, including studies of infec-
tious disease and measures aimed at protecting public health. As a result of 
these expenditures, scientists are also able to quickly identify the pathogens 
behind disease outbreaks unrelated to bioterror. For example, researchers 
identified a new species of Ebola (which causes a nearly always fatal form of 
hemorrhagic fever) during a 2008 outbreak in Uganda.
Critics have argued that the push for anti-bioterror research means that 
many important and more immediate problems go unsolved. Furthermore, 
the bad guys may not even have the technology needed to make the sophisti-
cated biological weapons that big money is spent to counter. Meanwhile, new 
regulations make research harder to conduct. Scientists can no longer easily 
exchange biological samples, meaning that the experts can’t always get the 
research materials they need to do their work.
DNA Bar Coding
You’re probably familiar with the black and white codes on the packaging 
of everything you purchase, from peanuts to computers. The computer bar 
code allows stores to track inventory and pricing of every item they carry. 
One of the hottest topics in genetics is how the genetic code may be used in 
a similar way to identify and track living things.
The idea is pretty simple: Using genes in mitochondrial DNA (which you can 
read about in Chapter 6), scientists look for sequences unique to particular 
species. After they determine that a sequence reliably identifies a given spe-
cies of animal, the “bar code” is registered in a database. So far, nearly 65,000 
species have been matched with a DNA bar code.
Though the idea behind DNA bar coding is simple, the genetics behind it are 
amazingly complex. Because practically all organisms carry identical DNA 
sequences (you and a banana, for example, share over 90 percent of your 
DNA in common), finding sequences that match up with one, and only one, 
species has been difficult. For this reason, many researchers criticize the 
idea. In addition, closely related species rarely interbreed, but they do so 
often enough that genetic lines are too blurry to make bar coding them reli-
able. Nonetheless, DNA bar coding has tremendous potential. For example, 
some genetic sleuthing in 2009 showed that almost half of the New York City 
sushi restaurants sampled had mislabeled their fish and were even serving 
up endangered species such as bluefin tuna. Such information may eventually 
be used to protect fisheries from being overexploited and to protect consum-
ers from being mislead.

Genetics Stories

T
hink you’ve heard it all? Well, put on your seat belt and get ready for 
some wild, wacky, and woolly — but true — stories from the genetics lab.
Scrambled Genes: Platypuses 
Break All the Rules
It has a bill like a duck and lays eggs, but it has fur and produces milk. This 
creature, which hails from eastern Australia, also produces venom (like a 
snake) that’s excreted by males from spurs on their hind limbs. Did I mention 
that this thing can swim and can sense electrical fields in the water to find 
fish? Is it a mammal? A bird?
It’s a platypus, and not only does it boast a truly strange combination of bird, 
reptile, and mammal characteristics, but it also has one of the most bizarre 
systems for determining sex. Platypuses (or is it platypi?) have a whopping 
10 sex chromosomes. Platypuses are diploid. Males have 21 pairs of chro-
mosomes, plus 10 sex chromosomes: 5 Xs and 5 Ys. Females have 21 pairs of 
chromosomes (identical to those of males), plus 10 Xs. The fun doesn’t stop 
there. The SRY gene that normally determines maleness in mammals — and 
yes, the platypus is considered a mammal — is absent. Instead, platypuses 
have a version of the bird sex-determining gene that’s located on one of the 5 
X chromosomes.

342
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The sequence of the platypus genome reveals that this incredible creature 
has genes in common with reptiles, mammals, and birds. This finding sug-
gests that the platypus (along with marsupials like kangaroos) is descended 
from a distant (like roughly 166 million years ago) reptilian ancestor of both 
mammals and birds. As scientists decipher the platypus’s many genetic 
secrets, conservationists are working to preserve its habitat, which is in 
danger from climate change, among other threats.
What’s in a Name?
Which is easier to remember: Lunatic Fringe or LFNG O-fucosylpeptide 
3-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase? I’m guessing you picked the first 
one, right? When scientists discover a new gene, one of the perks is getting to 
name it. For many fruit fly genes, the names are witty, easy to remember, and 
informative. Take Groucho Marx, which calls to mind the bushy eyebrows 
and mustache of the comedian — the fly with the Groucho gene has lots of 
facial bristles. Cheap Date? A mutation that causes an unusual sensitivity to 
alcohol. Out Cold? When it’s chilly, the fly with this mutation faints.
Not all scientists are laughing, however. The Human Genome Organization 
Gene Nomenclature Committee (whose own name could use a makeover) 
deemed some of these gene names “inappropriate, demeaning, and pejora-
tive.” That’s because there are human versions of the same genes. To avoid 
hurt feelings among doctors and patients, the committee is renaming some 
of the genes from simple, easy to remember, and fun monikers to long, multi-
syllabic, and, well, boring appellations. Goodbye Cheap Date; hello pituitary 
adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide gene.
Second Life
 
Long the stuff of science fiction, artificially created life forms may not be 
so far-fetched after all. In 2008, a team from the J. Craig Venter Institute 
announced that it had successfully synthesized an entire genome. (Venter 
is one of the pioneers of the Human Genome Project.) The newly created 
genome is a mock-up of the Mycoplasma genitalium gene sequence. To prevent 
the artificial version from leaking out and causing trouble, the researchers 
added a gene to make the bacteria dependent on an antibiotic for its growth 
and survival. They also added a John Hancock: The team members’ and insti-
tute’s names are spelled out in DNA code. Even with this advance, it’s not 
artificial life. To see if the synthesized genome works as well as a real one, 
researchers will insert it into a cell. This step will improve scientists’ under-
standing of what it takes to build genomes and how genes (real and synthe-
sized) work.

 Chapter 24: Ten Hard-to-Believe Genetics Stories
Lousy Chromosomes
The human body louse, a tiny, bloodsucking bug, has a big claim to genetic 
fame. It boasts a total of 18 mitochondrial chromosomes. Most animals have 
only a single, circular mitochondrial chromosome that’s transmitted from 
mother to offspring. But this louse, Pediculus humanus, has many mini-
chromosomes that contain between one and three genes each. Pieced 
together, the 18 chromosomes (more or less) add up to the usual one 
chromosome and its complement of 37 genes.
Not Yourself: DNA Chimeras
Imagine being told that, as a mom, the children you thought were yours, the 
ones you gave birth to, aren’t your own. This is exactly what happened to a 
patient at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. 
While searching for a possible donor for a kidney transplant, the woman — 
we’ll call her Sally — was told that her two sons weren’t hers, although they 
were fathered by her husband.
 
After a lot of speculation and DNA testing, researchers discovered that Sally’s 
tissues have two genetic signatures that are so distinct from each other that 
they could be from two different people. And that’s exactly where they came 
from: two embryos, nonidentical twin girls, that fused during development to 
make one person — Sally. That makes Sally a tetragametic chimera, or, to put 
it more simply, a fusion of two eggs fertilized by two sperm (that’s the tetra-
gametic or four-gametes part). The word chimera comes from the name of a 
mythical creature that had a lion’s head and a goat’s body.
 
It turns out that chimeras may be common, from a genetic standpoint. Studies 
show that many women carry their mother’s white blood cells, which appar-
ently cross from mom to child during pregnancy. These cells act to keep the 
growing fetus healthy and then continue to divide and fight disease through-
out the individual’s lifetime, all the while containing an entirely different 
person’s DNA fingerprint. As more evidence comes in, this form of chimerism 
may turn out to be the norm instead of the exception, meaning that all of us 
may not be quite ourselves after all.
Genes Even a Mother Could Love
Motherly love does more than make you feel good. It also affects your genes. 
Back in 2004, a group of geneticists discovered that in rats, individuals that 
as pups were well cared for by their moms had epigenetic patterns that 

344
Part V: The Part of Tens 
differed from rats that were neglected when young. These changes altered 
the DNA in the rats’ brain tissues, making them more or less susceptible to 
stress depending on mom’s caring behavior.
 
The researchers then wondered if humans have similar epigenetic changes in 
their brains. They compared the brains of people who were abused as children 
and later committed suicide to the brains of people without histories of abuse 
who died of other causes. The findings were stunning. The suicide victims had 
genetic changes to their brain tissue’s DNA, and the changes were confined only 
to the tissues of the brain where stress hormones are regulated. This means 
that the expression of your genes may be far more malleable and sensitive to 
your experiences than previously realized. It also opens the possibility of uncov-
ering causes of mental illness, as well as treatments and prevention.
One Gene to Rule Them All
A single gene controls pain perception. It was discovered when a boy in 
Pakistan came to the attention of medical authorities. As a street performer, 
the child walked over hot coals and stabbed himself with knives — not with 
trickery, but for real. It turned out that the child, and many of his relatives, 
felt no pain of any kind. Researchers tracked down a single gene mutation 
that controls all perception of pain. This is exciting news because it means 
that scientists may be able to formulate a drug to target the gene, controlling 
pain for people who suffer from debilitating conditions.
Why Alligators May Outlast Us All
Alligators are survivors. They live in nasty places, eat dead stuff, and don’t 
seem to be bothered by much of anything. In most creatures, an individual 
must be exposed to a disease-causing agent to become immune to it. Not so 
for alligators. Recent research shows that in addition to their toothy smiles, 
these massive reptiles have blood proteins that fight off infections from bac-
teria, fungi, and viruses, even without previous exposure to the offending 
microorganism. In tests, alligator blood proteins kill even antibiotic-resistant 
“super bugs” that cause thousands of human deaths each year. Scientists 
are now working to determine how to develop drugs based on the chemical

Genetic testing used to be reserved for special cases and dire circumstances. 
Not anymore. Now, getting yourself tested for all manner of genetic information —

 Chapter 24: Ten Hard-to-Believe Genetics Stories
from the possibility of cancers to a predisposition for male-pattern baldness — 
is a simple matter. Some enterprising people have even turned to doing genetic 
testing right in the comfort of their own home. Using castoff lab equipment 
purchased from that amazing online marketplace, eBay, and lab protocols 
downloaded from the Internet, it’s relatively simple to probe your own genes.
 
There’s even an organization called DIYbio (www.diybio.org) whose mem-
bers have gatherings like DNA extraction parties (I swear I’m not making this 
up) and provide info about and resources for taking biotechnology home . . . 
and using it.
Making Something Useful Out of Junk
 
Researchers are finding that “junk DNA,” proving to be far more functional and 
essential than ever before, is crucial for turning genes on and off. In addition, 
it may have been junk DNA that flipped the switch and gave primates like us 
the ability to grasp tools and walk upright. A particular section of noncoding 
DNA called HACNS1 kicks off genes that appear to control development of 
thumbs and big toes. These findings have led scientists to believe that junk 
DNA may be just as important in evolution as the genes themselves.

that completely masks another 
allele or phenotype. The pheno-
type exhibited by both homozy-
gotes and heterozygotes carrying 
a dominant allele.
epigenetics: Changes in gene 
expression and phenotype caused 
by characteristics of DNA outside 
the genetic code itself.
