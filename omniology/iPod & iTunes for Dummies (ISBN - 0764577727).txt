Dedication
This book is dedicated to John Paul Bove and James Eric Bove, both of whom
contributed tips and spent considerable time testing iPods while turning a
vacation into a book project. 
Authors’ Acknowledgments
John Paul Bove contributed technical expertise and writing for this edition
and has certainly earned his new laptop. We want to thank Rich Tennant for
his wonderful cartoons; our Wiley project editor Mark Enochs, and Editorial
Manager Kevin Kirschner, for ongoing assistance. We also thank Virginia
Sanders and Teresa Artman for editing and improving this book immensely.
A book this timely places a considerable burden on a publisher’s production
team, and we thank the production crew at Wiley for diligence beyond the call
of reason. We owe thanks and a happy hour to Carole McLendon at Waterside,
our agent. And we have acquisitions editor Bob Woerner at Wiley to thank for
coming up with the idea for this book. Finally, our heartfelt thanks to mem-
bers of the Flying Other Brothers (Pete Sears, Barry Sless, Jimmy Sanchez,
Bill Bennett, Bert Keely, TBone, and Roger and Ann McNamee) for the music
that inspired us while writing this book.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Introduction
Y
ou don’t need much imagination to see why we’re so happy with our
iPods.
Imagine no longer needing CDs. We take road trips that last for weeks, and we
never hear the same song twice. We leave our music library safe at home and
grab an iPod for a hike or jog and always listen to something different.
Imagine not waiting for hot new music. You can listen to it, purchase it, and
load it onto your iPod within minutes of discovering it on the Internet. Be the
first in your circle of friends to hear the exclusive new music available from
the iTunes Music Store.
Imagine not having to buy music more than once. You can purchase a CD 
or downloadable music and import the music into a digital library that lasts
forever. Imagine never again having to replace an unplayable CD.
Imagine a musician going backstage after a performance and meeting a pro-
moter who says that he can get him ten more gigs if he can confirm the dates
right now. This musician calmly scrolls through his calendar for the entire
year (conveniently stored on his iPod), finding all the details that he needs
about gigs and recording sessions, right down to the minute, including travel
directions to each gig. “No problem,” he says. And of course, he gets the gigs.
Okay, maybe you’re not a rock star whose career depends on the information
on your iPod. But if rock stars can use them, so can average music lovers.
When we first encountered the iPod, it came very close to fulfilling our dreams
as road warriors — in particular, the dream of filling up our cars with music
as easily as filling it up with fuel. As we go to press with this edition, another
milestone has been reached: BMW has just introduced the first car to sport
an iPod-compatible stereo. With the installation of an integrated adapter
developed by Apple and BMW, you can now control your iPod or iPod mini
through the existing audio system and multifunction steering wheel. Whether
you want to be On the Road with Jack Kerouac (in audio book form), or “Drivin’
South” with Jimi Hendrix, just fill up your iPod and go!

About This Book
We designed iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 2nd Edition, as a reference. You 
can find the information you need when you need it easily. We organized the
information so that you can read from beginning to end to find out how to
use iTunes and your iPod from scratch. But this book is also designed so 
that you can dive in anywhere and begin reading because you find all the 
info you need to know for each task.
We don’t cover every detail of every function of the software, and we inten-
tionally leave out some detail so that we don’t befuddle you with technospeak
when it’s not necessary. (Really, engineers can sometimes provide too many
obscure choices that no one ever uses.) We write brief but comprehensive
descriptions and include lots of cool tips on how to get the best results from
using iTunes and your iPod.
Conventions Used in This Book
Like any book that covers computers and information technology, this book
uses certain conventions:
 Choosing from a menu: In iTunes, when you see “Choose iTunes➪
Preferences in iTunes,” you click iTunes on the toolbar and then click
Preferences from the iTunes menu. 
With the iPod, when you see, “Choose Extras➪Calendars from the iPod
main menu,” you highlight Extras in the main menu with the scroll wheel,
press the Select button to select Extras, and then highlight and select
Calendars from the Extras menu.
 Clicking and dragging: When you see “Drag the song over the name of
the playlist,” we mean click the song name, hold the mouse button down,
and drag the song with the mouse over to the name of the playlist before
lifting your finger off the mouse button.
 Keyboard shortcuts: When you see Ô-I, press the Ô key on a Mac key-
board, along with the appropriate shortcut key (in this case, press I, which
opens the Song Information window in iTunes). On a Windows PC, the
same keyboard shortcut is Ctrl-I (which means press the Ctrl key along
with the I key).
 Step lists: When you come across steps you need to do in iTunes or on
the iPod, the action is in bold, and the explanatory part is underneath.
If you know what to do, read the action and skip the explanation. But if
you need a little help along the way, check out the explanation.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

And Just Who Are You?
You don’t need to know anything about audio technology to discover how 
to make the most of your iPod and the iTunes software that comes with it.
Although a course in music appreciation can’t hurt, the iPod is designed to
be useful even for air-guitar players who barely know the difference between
downloadable music and System of a Down. You don’t need any specialized
knowledge to have a lot of fun with your iPod and the iTunes software while
building up your digital music library.
However, we do make some honest assumptions about your computer skills:
 You know how to use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer: We assume
that you already know how to locate files and folders and that you can
copy files and folders from one hard drive to another on the computer 
of your choice: a Mac or a Windows PC.
 You know how to select menus and applications on a Mac or a
Windows PC: We assume that you already know how to choose an option
from a menu, how to find the Dock on a Mac to launch a Dock application
(or use the Start menu in Windows to launch an application), and how to
launch an application directly by double-clicking its icon.
For more information on these topics, see that excellent book by Mark L.
Chambers, Mac OS X All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies, or the massive
tome Windows XP GigaBook For Dummies, by Peter Weverka and company
(both from Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
A Quick Peek Ahead
This book is organized into six parts, with each part covering a different aspect
of using your iPod. Here’s a quick preview of what you can find in each part.
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music
This part gets you started with your iPod, powering it up, recharging its bat-
tery, using its menus, and connecting it to your computer. You install and set
up the iPod and iTunes software on your Mac or Windows PC. We show you
what you can do with iTunes. To acquire music, you can buy music from the
iTunes Music Store, or you can rip audio CDs. You also find out how to share
your iTunes music. For Windows users, we also provide information about
MusicMatch Jukebox. (MusicMatch Jukebox is an alternative to using iTunes
and is especially useful for PCs that use older versions of Windows and there-
fore can’t run iTunes.)

Introduction

Part II: Managing Your Music
This part shows you how to sort the music in your iTunes library by artist,
album, duration, date, and other items. You can add and edit iTunes song
information. You discover how to arrange songs and albums into iTunes
playlists that you can transfer to your iPod. When you have your music 
organized efficiently, transfer it to the iPod. You can also find out how to 
do all these things in MusicMatch Jukebox. And, for your peace of mind, 
we cover backing up your music and burning it to a CD.
Part III: Playing Tunes 
We show you how to locate and play songs on your iPod and then we move on
to various accessories for connecting your iPod to your home stereo and using
your iPod on the road with car stereos and portable speakers. You discover
how to play music on your iPod through any computer by using advanced DJ
techniques, such as cross-fading song playback and using the iTunes Party
Shuffle.
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques
In this part, you discover digital music encoding and how to change your
importing preferences. You can also fine-tune the sound playback with the
iTunes equalizer and on your iPod with the iPod equalizer. We describe what
you need to record sound and music into your computer from old records and
tapes, and how to modify songs in iTunes for playback on your iPod. We cover
how to enhance your iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox library with alternate
music sources and Web radio.
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel
In this part, use your iPod as a road warrior would: setting your alarm clock,
sorting your contacts, and recording voice memos, using your iPod as a hard
drive and adding notes and text, entering personal information into your
computer such as calendar appointments, To-Do lists, and contacts, and 
synchronizing your iPod with all your personal information. We provide trou-
bleshooting first steps and details about updating and restoring your iPod.

iPod & iTunes For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

Part VI: The Part of Tens
In this book’s Part of Tens chapters, we outline common problems and solu-
tions that happen to most iPods, tips about the iPod equalizer, and Web
sources of information to enhance your iPod experience.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book are important visual cues for information you need.
Remember icons highlight important things you need to remember.
Technical Stuff icons highlight technical details you can skip unless you want
to bring out the technical geek in you.
Tip icons highlight tips and techniques that save you time and energy, and
maybe money.
Warning icons save your butt by preventing disasters. Don’t bypass a warn-
ing without reading it. This is your only warning!

Daltrey of the Who, and the only way you can conveniently carry that much
music around while touring the Big Apple in one day is with an Apple iPod.
Music has changed so much during the shift from purchasing music in stores
to obtaining music online that the music industry hardly recognizes it, and
the Apple iPod music player is one of the major catalysts. The iPod holds so
much music that no matter how large your music collection, you will seriously
consider putting all your music into digital format on your computer, trans-
ferring portions of it to the iPod, and playing music from both your computer
and your iPod from now on. You might never stop buying CDs, but you won’t
have to buy all your music that way. And you’ll never again need to replace
the music that you already own.
As an iPod owner, you’re on the cutting edge of music player technology. This
chapter introduces the iPod and tells you what to expect when you open the
box. We describe how to power up your iPod and connect it to your computer,
both of which are essential tasks that you need to know how to do — your iPod
needs power, and your iPod needs music, which it gets from your computer.

Introducing the iPod
The iPod is, essentially, a hard drive and a digital music player in one device,
but that device is such a thing of beauty and style and so highly recognizable
by now that all Apple needs to do in an advertisement is show it all by itself.
Even the 40GB model (the largest capacity as of this writing) weighs less than
two CDs in standard jewel cases, and iPod mini is smaller than a cell phone
and weighs just 3.6 ounces.
The convenience of carrying music on an iPod is phenomenal. For example, the
40GB iPod model can hold around 10,000 songs. That’s more than 21 days of
nonstop music. You can put enough music on a 40GB iPod to last three weeks
if played continuously, around the clock — or about one new song a day for
the next 20 years. And with the iPod’s built-in skip protection in every model,
you don’t miss a beat as you jog through the park or your car hits a pothole.
Although Apple has every right to continue to promote its Macintosh com-
puters, the company saw the wisdom of making the iPod compatible with
Windows PCs. Every iPod now comes with the software that you need to
make it work with Windows systems as well as Macintosh OS X.
A common misconception is that your iPod becomes your music library.
Actually, your iPod is simply another player for your music library, which
is safely stored on your computer. One considerable benefit of digital music
technology is that you can use your computer to serve up your music library
and make perfect-quality copies. Copy as much of it as you want onto your
iPod, and take it on the road. Two decades from now those digital songs will
be the same in quality — the music won’t be trapped on a cassette or CD that
can degrade over time (CDs can stop working after 15-20 years). The wonder-
fully remixed, remastered, reconstituted version of your favorite album can
be copied over and over forever, just like the rest of your information, and it
never loses its sound fidelity. If you save your music in digital format, you will
never lose a song and have to buy it again. 
The iPod experience includes iTunes (or, in some cases, MusicMatch
Jukebox), which lets you organize your music in digital form, make copies,
burn CDs, and play disc jockey without discs. Suddenly your music world
includes online music stores and free music downloads. Without iTunes 
(or MusicMatch Jukebox), your iPod is merely an external hard drive. As a
result of using iTunes (or MusicMatch Jukebox), your music library is more
permanent than it ever was before because you can make backup copies 
that are absolutely the same in quality. We introduce iTunes in Chapter 2 
and describe MusicMatch Jukebox in Chapter 7.
You’ll spend only about ten seconds copying an entire CD’s worth of music
from iTunes on your computer to your iPod. Any iPod can play any song in
the most popular digital audio formats, including MP3, AIFF, WAV, and the
10
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

new AAC format, which features CD-quality audio in smaller file sizes than
MP3. The iPod also supports the Audible AA spoken word file format.
The iPod is also a data player, perhaps the first of its kind. As an external hard
drive, the iPod serves as a portable backup device for important data files.
You can transfer your calendar and address book to help manage your affairs
on the road, and you can even use calendar event alarms to supplement your
iPod’s alarm and sleep timer. Although the iPod isn’t as fully functional as a
personal digital assistance (PDA) — for example, you can’t add information
directly to the device — you can view the information. You can keep your cal-
endar and address book automatically synchronized to your computer, where
you normally add and edit information. We cover using the iPod as a data player
in detail in Chapter 24 and as a general-purpose hard drive in Chapter 25.
Comparing iPod Models
Introduced way back in the Stone Age of digital music (2001), the iPod family
has grown by three generations and spawned at least one private-label version
(the HPod from Hewlett-Packard). Even from the beginning, iPod models were
truly innovative for their times. With the MP3 music players of 2001, you could
carry about 20 typical songs (or a single live Phish set) with you, but the first
iPod could hold more than 1,000 typical songs (or a 50-hour Phish concert).
Today’s iPod works with iTunes on either Windows computers or Macs, but
that wasn’t always the case. The first-generation iPods work only with Macs.
In 2002, Apple introduced the second generation — one version for Windows
and another for the Mac, using the same design for both. For the third gener-
ation (2003), Apple changed the design once again.
Third-generation and fourth-generation models, which are the only models
available from Apple as of this writing, work with either Windows or Mac and
come in a variety of hard-drive sizes. Some would argue that iPod mini, intro-
duced in early 2004, is part of the fourth generation, but in most ways it is
more like a spin-off of the third generation because it has the same capabilities
and uses the same software as the third generation. (iPod mini also works with
either Mac or Windows.) But they look similar — the fourth-generation iPods,
announced just as this book went to press, use the same type of buttons and
controls as iPod mini.
By design, you can hold an iPod in your hand while you thumb the scroll wheel
(our generic term for scroll wheel, scroll pad, touch wheel, or click wheel).
The LCD screen on full-size models offers backlighting so that you can see it
in the dark. For a nifty chart that shows the differences between iPod models,
see the specifications page on the Apple iPod Web site (www.apple.com/
ipod/specs.html).
11
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

First-generation iPods
Apple doesn’t sell first-generation iPods anymore, but you might see a few on
eBay. More likely, their proud owners are Mac users who still find them useful.
Despite its high price tag ($399) compared with other MP3 players, the first
5GB iPod (offering 5GB of storage space) was an unqualified success when it
was introduced in October 2001. Apple sold more than 125,000 units within
60 days. “Listening to music will never be the same again,” Apple CEO Steve
Jobs told the press at the introduction of the first iPod, and he was right.
Months later, Apple introduced the 10GB model.
First-generation iPods work only with Macs, connecting to a Mac with a stan-
dard FireWire cable. The first generation offers a distinctive scroll wheel that
physically turns with your finger as you use it. These early iPods are hefty at
6.5 ounces and have a stainless-steel back and dual-plastic top casing.
FireWire is called IEEE 1394 by the engineers who designed it and DV terminal
by camcorder manufacturers that use it, except Sony, which calls it i.Link.
These models don’t offer all the features of newer generations and can’t be
used with accessories that are designed for newer generations. For example,
you can’t expect these older models to use extensions such as voice recorders
and memory card readers. First-generation models can’t be updated to ver-
sion 2 or newer versions of the iPod software, so they also lack support for
features such as adding notes to the iPod and setting up an on-the-go playlist.
However, battery life is comparable to newer models, offering up to eight hours
before requiring a recharge. (For more about battery life, see “Facing Charges
of Battery,” later in this chapter.)
Second-generation iPods
Just as enterprising Linux and Windows developers were trying to cobble
together ways to make the iPod work with their systems, Apple introduced a
second-generation design in the form of two models: the 20GB iPod for the Mac
and the 10GB for Windows, which was supplied preformatted for Windows. The
Windows model of the second generation shipped with MusicMatch Jukebox
(which we describe in Chapter 7). 
Second-generation models use an innovative solid-state touch wheel that
doesn’t physically turn as you use it but instead responds to finger pressure.
These models use a standard FireWire connection to connect to the computer
with a six-pin FireWire cable.
Second-generation models can’t be updated to version 2 of the iPod software,
so they don’t offer all the features of the third and fourth generation and can’t
be used with accessories designed for third-generation and fourth-generation
12
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

models. Although standard FireWire accessories (such as power adapters for
automobiles) are available for these models, voice recorders and memory card
readers are not (as of this writing). 
Third-generation iPods
The third-generation models, many of which are still sold in stores as of this
writing, include the 10GB, 15GB, and 30GB models introduced in 2003, and the
20GB and 40GB models introduced later in that same year. All third-generation
models and variants, such as iPod mini, share the same basic features and
work with the Mac or Windows, and Apple continually provides software
updates for these models.
Models of the third generation are thinner than the second generation and use
touch-sensitive buttons with audible feedback (replacing the pressure-sensitive
buttons of the second generation that offer tactile feedback). Third-generation
models also use a dock connector to connect to a computer or power supply
(see Figure 1-1). The dock keeps your iPod in an upright position while con-
nected and lets you connect a home stereo or headphones through the dock,
which makes it convenient as a base station when you’re not traveling with
your iPod — you can slip the iPod into the dock without connecting cables. 
Figure 1-1:
The third-
generation
iPod in its
dock con-
nected to
the power
adapter.
13
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

The dock doesn’t come standard with the 15GB model, but you can order it
as an extra from the Apple Store. 
The supplied cables connect to the dock on one end (or to the iPod itself, if
you don’t use a dock) and connect to a computer or power supply on the other
end, using standard FireWire or USB 2.0 (some models may not include the USB
cable, but you can order it from the Apple Store for about $20). (PC users crave
choice — you can read about USB in the sidebar “FireWire or USB: That is the
question” in this chapter.)
iPod mini
The third generation also includes iPod mini, as shown in Figure 1-2, which is
small enough to fit in a shirt pocket. Its smooth, ultra-thin, anodized aluminum
case comes in five different colors and houses a 4GB drive that can hold about
1,000 songs — as much as the original 5GB model. (An iPod mini can fit more
songs in the same amount of space because Apple introduced a better com-
pression format called AAC in second-generation models, as described in
Chapter 19. The AAC format can also be used in older models, so in effect
when Apple introduced AAC the capacity of all models increased.)
Figure 1-2:
iPod mini fits

pocket.
14
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Besides its smaller size (and therefore, smaller dock), another of iPod mini’s
distinguishing characteristic is the click wheel, which offers the same functions
as the touch wheel but is more suitable for such a small device. The click wheel
combines the scroll wheel and buttons, with pressure-sensitive buttons under-
neath the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the circular pad of the wheel.
iPod mini has the same software features as the full-size, third-generation iPods
except that it uses a different set of accessories because of its size. We describe
both types of iPods and their accessories throughout this book.
Fourth-generation iPods
As this book goes to press, Apple just introduced a fourth-generation iPod,
shown in Figure 1-3, that uses the same click wheel and buttons as iPod mini,
and offers several new features with the new software update (version 3.0) of
the iPod software. This includes the ability to randomly shuffle the playback
of songs with the press of a button and to charge up the iPod through the
USB connection to your computer (previously only FireWire connections to
the computer provided power). The fourth-generation iPods are available in
40GB and 20GB models.
Figure 1-3:
The fourth-
generation
iPod uses
the same
click wheel
as iPod mini.
15
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

The new units also offer up to 12 hours of battery time between charges. The
battery is the same type as used in other models — the improvement is in how
the software manages power in the iPod. Like third-generation iPods, the fourth
generation also uses a dock connector to connect the iPod to a computer or
power supply, and the dock itself is available separately from the Apple Store.
The fourth-generation iPods connect to computers using either FireWire or
USB connections.
The new iPod models differ from earlier models by offering a top-level Music
choice in the main menu and the ability to create multiple on-the-go playlists.
You can also play audio books at slower or faster speeds while maintaining
natural-sounding pitch.
Thinking Inside the Box
Don’t destroy the elegantly designed box while opening it; you might want to
place it prominently in your collection of Equipment That Ushered in the 21st
Century. Before going any further, check the box and make sure that all the
correct parts came with your iPod.
Things you have and things you need
The iPod box includes a CD-ROM with the iTunes software for the Mac and
PC and the FireWire and USB cables you can use to connect your iPod to a
computer. All models come with a FireWire-compatible power adapter for
connecting either the older iPod or the newer iPod-in-dock to an AC power
source.
With most models, you also get a set of earbud headphones and a remote
controller that connects to the iPod by wire. The accessories don’t stop
there — you might also have a carrying case and some other goodies. Optional
accessories, many of which we describe in this book, are available at the online
Apple Store (www.apple.com/store).
You also need a few things that don’t come with the iPod:
 A PC or Mac: With a Mac, iTunes requires Mac OS X 10.1.5 or newer
for connecting with FireWire (OS X 10.3.4 for connecting via USB), a
400 MHz G3 processor or better and at least 256MB of RAM. You also need
QuickTime, which you can download from the Apple Web site for free
16
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

(but most Macs already have it). On a PC, iTunes requires Windows 2000
or XP, a 500 MHz Pentium-class processor or faster, and 256MB of RAM.
You can alternatively use the iPod with MusicMatch Jukebox and a 300
MHz or faster PC with at least 96MB of RAM running Windows Me, 2000,
or XP (with at least 128MB of RAM).
 FireWire or USB connection on a PC: All Macs provide FireWire, so
you’re all set. PCs running Windows must have FireWire also called IEEE
1394) or USB 2.0. See the sidebar “FireWire or USB: That is the question”
in this chapter for more information about FireWire and USB 2.0 connec-
tions on PCs.
 iTunes 4.6 or newer: You can download Mac or Windows versions for
free from the Apple Web site (www.apple.com/itunes). The CD-ROM
that’s supplied with newer iPods should have both versions of iTunes as
well, but some may have iTunes 4.5 — which is fine, because version 4.5
works (it just doesn’t have all the features of 4.6), and you can download
the 4.6 version at any time to replace it. CD-ROMs supplied with some
older iPod models provided MusicMatch Jukebox instead. You can use
MusicMatch Jukebox if you don’t meet the requirements to run iTunes
(see Chapter 7).
 Optional: Mac users can install iSync, which is a free utility program from
Apple for synchronizing your iPod (and PDAs and cell phones) with your
address book and calendar, and iCal for creating and editing your calen-
dar. Both are available for free from www.apple.com.
Using FireWire or USB cables with a Mac
If you have a Mac, the choice is easy: FireWire has been a part of every Mac
since at least 2000, and it’s much faster than the USB connections typical
on Macs. (To find out about FireWire, see the sidebar “FireWire or USB:
That is the question” in this chapter.) However, differences exist between
iPod generations.
Current (third-generation and fourth-generation) models offer a special 
cable with a flat dock connector to connect the dock — or the iPod itself —
to the Mac’s FireWire port. The dock includes a cable with a flat dock 
connector on one end and a FireWire (or optional USB) connector on the
other. (An optional cable is available from the Apple Store that offers USB).
You can connect the FireWire or USB end of the cable to the computer (to
synchronize with iTunes and play iPod music in iTunes) or to the power
adapter.
17
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

The connection on the bottom of the iPod is the same as the connection on
back of the dock. Plug the flat connector of the cable into the iPod or dock,
and then plug the six-pin FireWire connector on the other end to the FireWire
18
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 
FireWire or USB: That is the question
If you use a Mac, FireWire is the choice to make
unless your Mac offers USB 2.0 and you’re using
an iPod mini. If you use a PC, you can choose
between FireWire and USB 2.0 depending on
which one you already have and whether you
need to use the ports for something else.
Why so complicated? It’s a question of speed and
convenience. FireWire can hustle data at rates
up to 400 Mbps over its cable. That’s typically
fast enough — with FireWire, you can transfer
an entire CD’s worth of music in less than ten
seconds.
But engineers are never happy; they keep making
things better. USB (Universal Serial Bus) has
been around for a while, connecting hundreds of
nifty devices to PCs. Such nifty devices include
keyboards, pointing devices, external hard drives,
keychain-sized flash drives, printers, scanners,
and much more. USB proponents envied FireWire,
which is more than 30 times faster than USB
version 1.1, which offers a speed of only 12 Mbps.
So they developed a more advanced generation
of USB. Version 2.0 has a transfer rate of 480
Mbps — that’s 40 times faster than the first 
version — but since USB in practice does not
sustain that rate for the entire data transfer, as
FireWire does, FireWire is still faster.
Both FireWire and USB 2.0 connections are
plug-and-play: You can plug them in at any time
whether your computer is on or off. Depending
on the device that you use with these connec-
tions, FireWire or USB 2.0 can provide power to
the device.
The horse race between FireWire and USB 2.0 has
left some computers in the dust, such as older
Macs and PCs. Many Mac models now sport USB
2.0 connectors, but when it comes to iPods, only
iPod mini supports USB 2.0 for the Mac. So, for
most Mac users, FireWire is the only choice. Many
desktop PCs and laptops offer PCI and/or CardBus
slots for adding FireWire or USB 2.0 cards, and
some PCs offer built-in FireWire or USB 2.0.
Have we made your choice easier yet? If you
have a PC with USB 2.0 (which is more common
than one with FireWire), go with it. The only draw-
back is that you might not be able to get power
from the connection (depending on the PC), so
you wouldn’t be able to recharge your iPod’s bat-
tery from your PC.
You can add FireWire to your PC with an expan-
sion card such as the FireCard 400 CardBus card
from Unibrain (www.unibrain.com), which
plugs into a PC desktop or laptop CardBus slot.
Laptop PCs made as far back as 1999 offer
CardBus slots. Desktop PCs typically let you add
expansion cards inside the PC, and there are
many IEEE 1394 expansion cards available on
the market. Before you buy a FireWire/IEEE 1394
card, make sure that it’s compatible with your
hardware and operating system. Apple offers
approved FireWire expansion cards at the online
Apple Store (http://store.apple.com/1-
800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore).
If you have trouble installing your FireWire or
USB 2.0 card or using your iPod with it, see Chap-
ter 28 for troubleshooting tips.

port on your Mac (marked the Y symbol that resembles a radiation symbol),
or plug the USB connector to the USB port on your Mac.
The full-size third-generation iPods don’t support USB 2.0 on the Mac, but
iPod mini and fourth-generation models support it if your Mac offers USB 2.0,
and a USB cable is provided. You need OS X 10.3.4 for connecting via USB 2.0
to a Mac.
First-generation and second-generation models offer only a standard FireWire
connection, so you can use a standard Mac-style FireWire cable to connect
the iPod to the Mac’s FireWire connection. Plug the six-pin connector of a
standard FireWire cable into the iPod, and plug the six-pin connector on the
other end to the FireWire port on your Mac. (The six-pin connector is marked
by the Y symbol that resembles a radiation symbol.)
Using FireWire or USB cables with a PC
If you have a Windows PC you can use FireWire (called IEEE 1394 in PC circles),
or USB 2.0, which is available on most current desktop PCs and laptops. 
FireWire/IEEE 1394 expansion cards are available in various formats: Some
offer the standard six-pin port found on Macs, and some offer a four-pin port
that is also used in camcorders. If your card has a six-pin port, you can plug
your iPod cable directly into it.
For cards with four-pin ports, Apple provides the FireWire cable adapter, 
as shown in Figure 1-4, and you can hook it up to the Mac-standard six-pin
connector at the end of your FireWire cable. The small four-pin connector on
the adapter plugs into the four-pin port on the FireWire card. Then plug the
other end of your cable to your iPod or your dock. You can purchase a special
FireWire/IEEE 1394 cable that has a six-pin plug on one end and a four-pin plug
on the other — look for it in well-stocked electronics stores that sell digital
camcorders, as many camcorders use such a cable.
The FireWire cable adapter is supplied with full-size iPods but not with iPod
mini. You can purchase one from the Apple Store. 
If you use USB 2.0 with your PC, you can use the USB 2.0 cable supplied with
your iPod or iPod mini. The USB 2.0 cable that has a flat dock connector on
one end and a USB 2.0 connector on the other. Apple also offers a combina-
tion FireWire/USB 2.0 cable with a dock connector on one end and a cable
that forks into two connectors — one for FireWire and one for USB 2.0.

Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

Powering Up Your iPod
All iPods come with essentially the same requirement: power. Fortunately, it
also comes with a cable and an AC power adapter that works with voltages in
North America and many parts of Europe and Asia. (See Chapter 17 for infor-
mation about plugging into power in other countries.)
First-generation and second-generation iPod models offer a Mac-style FireWire
connection on the top of the iPod. The power adapter also sports a FireWire
connection, so all you need is a standard six-pin FireWire cable to plug in.
Third-generation and fourth-generation models and iPod mini can use a dock
that offers FireWire and USB connections. The dock can also connect to your
home stereo through a line-out connection. 
A FireWire connection to a Mac provides power to the iPod and recharges
the battery as long as the Mac isn’t in sleep mode. A FireWire connection to a
FireWire/IEEE 1394 card in a PC might not be able to provide power — check
with the card manufacturer. The smaller 4-pin connections for FireWire/IEEE
1394 cards typically don’t supply power to the iPod.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

If your iPod shows a display but doesn’t respond to your touch, don’t panic —
check the Hold switch on top of the unit and make sure that it’s set to one side
so that the orange bar disappears (the normal position). You use the Hold
switch for locking the buttons, which prevents accidental activation.
You might notice that the iPod’s display turns iridescent when it gets too
hot or too cold, but this effect disappears when its temperature returns
to normal. iPods can function in temperatures as cold as 50 degrees and
as warm as 95 degrees (Fahrenheit) but work best at room temperature
(closer to 68 degrees).
If you leave your iPod out in the cold all night, it might have trouble waking
from sleep mode, and it might even display a low battery message. Plug the
iPod into a power source, wait until it warms up, and try it again. If it still
doesn’t wake up or respond properly, try resetting the iPod as we describe
in “Resetting Your iPod,” later in this chapter.
Facing Charges of Battery
You can take a six-hour flight from Pennsylvania to California and listen to your
iPod the entire time. All iPod models use the same type of built-in rechargeable
lithium ion battery; the first-, second-, and third-generation iPods offer up to
eight hours of battery power, and the fourth generation offers up to 12 hours.
However, keep in mind that playback battery time varies with the type of
encoder that you use for the music files in iTunes — Chapter 19 has more
information about encoders. It also varies depending on how you use your
iPod controls and settings.
The iPod battery recharges automatically when you connect the iPod to a
power source — for example, it starts charging immediately when you insert
it into a dock that’s connected to a power source (or to a computer with a
powered FireWire connection). It takes only four hours to recharge the bat-
tery fully.
Need power when you’re on the run? Look for a power outlet in the airport
terminal or hotel lobby — you can fast-charge the battery to 80-percent
capacity in one hour. If you can wait four hours, your iPod is fully charged.
Don’t fry your iPod with some generic power adapter — use only the power
adapter supplied with the iPod from Apple.
21
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

A battery icon in the top-right corner of the iPod display indicates with a
progress bar how much power is left. When you charge the battery, the icon
turns into a lightning bolt inside a battery. If the icon doesn’t animate, the bat-
tery is fully charged. You can also use your iPod while the battery is charging,
or disconnect it and use it before the battery is fully charged.
Maintaining battery life
The iPod’s built-in rechargeable lithium ion battery is, essentially, a life-or-
death proposition. After it’s dead, it can be replaced, but the replacement
may cost more than $50 (some services may charge less for older models).
If your warranty is still active, you can have Apple replace it — but you don’t
want to do that yourself because opening the iPod invalidates the warranty. 
Fortunately the battery is easy to maintain. We recommend calibrating the
battery once soon after you get your iPod — that is, run it all the way down
(a full discharge) and then charge it all the way up (which takes four hours).
Although this doesn’t actually change battery performance, it does improve
the battery gauge so that the iPod displays a more accurate indicator.
Unlike batteries that require you to fully discharge and then recharge in order
to get a fuller capacity, the iPod lithium ion battery prefers a partial rather than
a full discharge, so avoid frequent full discharges after the initial calibration
(frequent full discharges can lower battery life). Lithium ion batteries typi-
cally last three years or more and are vulnerable to high temperatures, which
decrease their life spans considerably. Don’t leave your iPod in a hot place,
such as on a sunny car dashboard, for very long.
For an excellent technical description of how to maintain rechargeable
lithium ion batteries, see the BatteryUniversity.com Web site (www.battery
university.com/parttwo-34.htm).
The bottom of the iPod warms up when it’s powered on. The bottom functions
as a cooling surface that transfers heat from inside the unit to the cooler air
outside. The iPod’s carrying case acts as an insulator, so be sure to remove
the iPod from its carrying case before you recharge it. 
Keeping the iPod encased in its carrying case when charging is tempting
but also potentially disastrous. The iPod needs to dissipate its heat, and
you could damage the unit by overheating it and frying its circuits, rendering
it as useful as a paperweight. To get around this problem, you can purchase
one of the heat-dissipating carrying cases available in the Apple Store. For
example, Marware (www.marware.com/) offers the SportSuit Convertible
case ($39.95).

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Even when not in use, your iPod drinks the juice. If your iPod is inactive for
14 days, you must recharge its battery — perhaps the iPod gets depressed
from being left alone too long. 
Saving power
Your iPod is a hard drive, and whatever causes the hard drive to spin causes
a drain on power. Your iPod also has a cache — a memory chip holding the
section of music to play next. The iPod uses the cache not only to eliminate
skipping when something jostles the hard drive but also to conserve power
because the drive doesn’t have to spin as much.
If you use the AIFF or WAV formats for importing music into iTunes (or
MusicMatch Jukebox), don’t use these formats with your iPod — convert the
music first, as we describe in Chapter 20. These formats take up way too much
space on the iPod hard drive and fill up the iPod cache too quickly, causing
skips when you play them and using too much battery power because the
drive spins more often. (See Chapter 5 for importing with iTunes, or flip to
Chapter 7 for importing with MusicMatch Jukebox. Chapter 19 provides
detailed information about these formats.)
The following are tips on power saving while using your iPod:
 Pause: Pause playback when you’re not listening. Pausing (stopping)
playback is the easiest way to conserve power.
 Back away from the light: Use the iPod backlight sparingly. Press and
hold the Menu button to turn off the backlight, or select Backlight from
the iPod main menu to turn it on or off. For a solution that lasts longer,
turn the Backlight Timer setting to Off on the Settings menu. Don’t use
the backlight in daylight.
 Hold it: Flip the Hold switch to the lock position (with the orange bar
showing) to make sure that controls aren’t accidentally activated. You
don’t want your iPod playing music in your pocket and draining the bat-
tery when you’re not listening.
 You may continue: Play songs continuously without using the iPod con-
trols. Selecting songs and using Previous/Rewind and Next/Fast-Forward
requires precious energy. Not only that, but the hard drive has to spin
more often when searching for songs, using more power than during
continuous playback.
Always use the latest iPod software and update your software when updates
come out. Apple is always trying to improve the way your iPod works, and
many of these advancements relate to power usage.

Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

Replacing your battery
Apple customers aren’t always happy campers. Early iPods came with 
batteries that couldn’t be replaced, but all it took were a few premature 
battery failures and quite a few customer complaints for Apple to institute
a battery replacement service. Apple also offers a special AppleCare war-
ranty for iPods.
You can’t remove or replace the iPod internal battery yourself — you need
Apple to replace it if it dies.
If your iPod isn’t responding after a reset (see “Resetting Your iPod” in this
chapter for how to reset your iPod), follow the troubleshooting steps in
Chapter 28. If these steps don’t restore your iPod to working condition, you
might have a battery problem. Go to the Apple support page for the iPod
(www.apple.com/support/ipod/index.html) and click the iPod service
FAQ link to read frequently asked questions and answers about iPod support.
Then click the iPod service request form link on the support page and follow
the instructions to request service and return your iPod for a replacement.
The only time we had to do this (with a 30GB iPod), Apple required us to send
just the iPod unit itself, without the power adapter or any other accessories,
to Apple’s service facility. Within a week, Apple sent back a brand new iPod
(same model).
Thumbing through the Menus
After you import music into the iPod, you’re ready to play music. The design of
the iPod lets you hold it in one hand and perform simple operations by thumb.
Even if you’re all thumbs when pressing small buttons on tiny devices, you can
still thumb your way to iPod heaven.
The iPod’s unique circular scroll wheel makes scrolling through an entire
music collection quick and easy. With your finger or thumb, scroll clockwise
on the wheel to scroll down a list, or counter-clockwise to scroll up. As you
scroll, options on the menu are highlighted. Use the Select button at the center
of the scroll wheel to select whatever is highlighted in the menu display. 
In full-size third-generation models, the touch-sensitive buttons above
the scroll wheel perform simple functions when you touch them. (First-
generation and second-generation models aren’t touch-sensitive, so you
need to press them.)
24
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

iPod mini and fourth-generation iPods provide a click wheel that offers the
same functions as the scroll wheel and the clickable buttons. It has pressure-
sensitive buttons underneath the top, bottom, left, and right areas of the 
circular pad of the wheel. These areas tilt as you press them, activating the
buttons.
The iPod main menu for the newer fourth-generation models, shown in
Figure 1-5, offers the following selections:
 Music: Select music by playlist, artist, album, song, genre, or composer,
or select an audio book.
 Extras: View and set the clock and alarm clock, view contacts, view your
calendar, view notes, and play games.
 Settings: Set display settings, menu settings, the backlight timer, the
clicker, and the date and time.
 Shuffle Songs: Play songs from your music library in random order.
 Backlight: Turn on or off the backlighting for the iPod display.
 Now Playing: This appears only when a song is playing — it takes you to
the Now Playing display.

Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

The main menu for first, second, and third generation iPods, and iPod mini,
replace the Music selection above with the following:
 Playlists: Select a playlist to play.
 Browse: Select by artist, album, song, genre, or composer.
Pressing the iPod Buttons
The buttons do various tasks for song playback:
 Previous/Rewind: Press once to start a song over. Press twice to skip to
the previous song. Press and hold to rewind through a song.
 Menu: Press once to go back to the previous menu. Each time you press,
you go back to a previous menu until you reach the main menu. Press
and hold the button to turn on the backlight.
 Play/Pause: Press to play the selected song, album, or playlist. Press
Play/Pause when a song is playing to pause the playback.
 Next/Fast-Forward: Press once to skip to the next song. Press and hold
Next/Fast-Forward to fast-forward through the song.
The buttons and scroll wheel can do more complex functions when used in
combination:
 Turn on the iPod. Press any button.
 Turn off the iPod. Press and hold the Play/Pause button.
 Disable the iPod buttons. To keep from accidentally pressing the buttons,
push the Hold switch to the other side so that an orange bar appears (the
Hold position). To reactivate the iPod buttons, push the Hold switch back
to the other side so that the orange bar disappears (the normal position).
 Reset the iPod. Set the Hold switch to the Hold position, and then move
it back to normal. Then, on first-, second-, or third-generation iPods or
iPod mini, press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously for
about five seconds until the Apple logo appears in the iPod display; for
the newer fourth-generation iPods, press the Menu and Select buttons
simultaneously for six seconds. You can reset the iPod if it gets hung 
up for some reason. (For example, it might get confused if you press 
the buttons too quickly.) This operation resets the iPod, essentially
restarting the iPod’s hard drive. It doesn’t change the music or data 
on the iPod. See “Resetting Your iPod,” later in this chapter.
26
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

 Turn the backlight on and off. Press and hold the Menu button (or select
the Backlight option from the main menu).
 Change the volume. While playing a song (the display reads Now
Playing), adjust the volume with the scroll wheel — clockwise turns the
volume up, counterclockwise turns the volume down. A volume slider
appears on the iPod display, indicating the volume level as you scroll.
 Skip to any point in a song. While playing a song (the display says Now
Playing), press and hold the Select button until the progress bar appears
to indicate where you are in the song, and then use the scroll wheel to
scroll to any point in the song. Scroll clockwise to move forward, and
counterclockwise to move backward.
Setting the Language
Wiedergabelisten? Übersicht? (Playlists? Browse?) If your iPod is speaking in
a foreign tongue, don’t panic — you’re not in the wrong country. You might
have purchased an iPod that’s set to a foreign language. More likely, someone
set it to a different language accidentally or on purpose (as a practical joke).
Fortunately, you can change the setting without having to know the language
that it’s set to.
To set the language, no matter what language the menu is using, follow these
steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the
words on the display.
If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at the
main menu.
2. Choose the third option from the top on the newer fourth-generation
iPods, or the fourth option on iPod mini and older models (in English,
this is the Settings option).
Scroll clockwise until the item is highlighted, and then press the Select
button. The Settings menu appears.
3. Choose the thirteenth option from the top on the newer fourth-
generation iPods, or the twelfth option on older models (which, in
English, is the Language option).
The Language menu appears.
4. Choose the language that you want to use. (English is at the top of 
the list.)
27
Chapter 1: Getting Started with Your iPod

If these steps don’t do the trick, the menu may have been customized 
(something you can discover how to do in Chapter 24). Someone could have
customized it previously, or perhaps you accidentally pressed buttons that
customized the menu. To get around this problem, you can reset all the iPod
settings back to the defaults. (Unfortunately, resetting your iPod settings back
to the defaults wipes out any customizations that you’ve made; you have to
redo any repeat/shuffle settings, alarms, backlight timer settings, and so on.)
Follow these steps to reset all your settings, no matter what language displays:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly until pressing it doesn’t change the
words on the display.
If pressing the Menu button no longer changes the display, you’re at the
main menu.
2. Choose the third option from the top on the newer fourth-generation
iPods, or the fourth option on iPod mini and older models (in English,
this is the Settings option).
The Settings menu appears.
3. Choose the option at the bottom of the menu (in English, the Reset All
Settings option).
The Reset All Settings menu appears.
4. Choose the second menu option (in English, the Reset option; the first
menu option is Cancel).
The Language menu appears.
5. Choose the language you want to use. (English is at the top of the list.)
The language you choose now applies to all the iPod menus. But don’t go
pulling that joke on someone else!
Resetting Your iPod
If your iPod doesn’t turn on, don’t panic — at least not yet. First check the
Hold switch’s position on top of the iPod. If it’s in the locked position (with
orange showing), slide it to the normal position. If it still doesn’t work, check
whether the iPod has enough juice. Is the battery charged up? Connect the
iPod to a power source and see whether it works.
There are times when your iPod freezes up or seems confused, and it just
won’t start up. Pressing more than one iPod button at the same time might
have caused this problem, or perhaps you disconnected the iPod from your
computer before it had a chance to display the iPod’s main menu (or in older
models, the message saying it’s okay to disconnect). In situations like this,
you can reset the iPod.
28
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Resetting the iPod isn’t the same as resetting the settings of your iPod. If all
you need to do is reset the settings on the Settings menu, you can choose
Settings➪Reset All Settings➪Reset from the main menu. (We cover the set-
tings on the Settings menu in Chapter 24.) All your menu and display settings
return to their original values.
This section is about a different kind of reset — similar to pressing a reset
button on a computer. This operation resets the operating system of the iPod
and restarts the system. Sometimes when your iPod gets confused or refuses
to turn on, you can fix it by resetting it. Follow these steps:
1. Toggle the Hold switch to the locked position and then back to the
unlocked position.
This step is like the beginning of a secret handshake.
2. On the new fourth-generation models, press the Menu and Select but-
tons simultaneously; on older models, press the Menu and Play/Pause
buttons simultaneously. Hold these buttons for at least six seconds until
the Apple logo appears; then release the buttons when you see the
Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons. 
Releasing the Menu and Select buttons (or Play/Pause on older models)
as soon as you see the Apple logo is important. If you continue to hold
down the buttons after the logo appears, the iPod displays the low bat-
tery icon (which looks like a slashed battery), and you must connect it
to a power source before using your iPod again. 
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music
and data files.

Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod
In This Chapter

A
n iPod without iTunes is like a CD player without CDs. Sure, you can use
applications and utilities from sources other than Apple to put music on
an iPod. (See Chapter 23 if you don’t believe us.) But iTunes gives you access
to the vast online iTunes Music Store, and it’s excellent for managing music
on your computer and synchronizing your music library with your iPod.
On the Mac, iTunes is practically the only jukebox in town — it’s not profitable
to compete with something that’s free. And yet, Apple hasn’t abused its posi-
tion by putting out a less-than-functional program. On Windows, iTunes has
plenty of competition but is still one of the top five audio players.
This chapter explains how to set up your iPod with iTunes on the Mac or for
Windows. You have to choose one or the other, at least for the moment — to
see how to switch from one type of computer to another, flip to Chapter 28.
If you don’t use Windows 2000 or Windows XP on your PC, you can’t use
iTunes for Windows — you have to install MusicMatch Jukebox from the 
iPod CD-ROM. (We describe MusicMatch Jukebox in Chapter 7.) You might
want to use MusicMatch Jukebox for other reasons, such as its compatibility
with other audio formats and its own MusicMatch MX radio — but you must
choose because your iPod can synchronize with only iTunes or MusicMatch
Jukebox.

Setting Up iTunes
If your Mac is rather new, you probably already have iTunes installed
because all Macs sold since 2003 (and many before that time) are prein-
stalled with iTunes and Mac OS X (version 10.1.5 or newer). The most up-to-
date version of iTunes as of this writing is version 4.6. If you’ve never used
iTunes before, when you first launch it, you automatically get the iTunes
Setup Assistant.
The version of iTunes that’s provided with your iPod on a CD-ROM might be
the newest version; then again, it might not be. Software updates occur very
rapidly. If you really want the latest version, go directly to the Apple Web site
to get it. You can download iTunes for free. Install iTunes first, and then install
the iPod software.
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of 
iTunes when it becomes available. Simply use Software Update from the 
Mac OS X System Preferences window. Click the Check Now button to 
check for a new version. If one exists, it appears in a window for you to
select. Click the check mark to select it, and then click Install to download
and install it.
If you use a PC with Windows, you most likely don’t have iTunes yet. Go
directly to the Apple Web site and download the latest version.
iPods that were sold before iTunes became available for Windows (in the fall
of 2003) don’t include iTunes on the CD-ROM. The older iPod CD-ROMs install
MusicMatch Jukebox. If you plan on using iTunes for Windows, which requires
Windows XP or Windows 2000, download the newer iTunes and iPod installers
from the Apple Web site.
When you get your iPod, you might be tempted to go ahead and install from
the CD-ROM. Our experience, especially with Windows PCs, is that you’re
better off going to the Apple Web site first and downloading the latest ver-
sions of the iTunes and iPod installers for Windows. Install iTunes first, and
then install the iPod software.
To download iTunes for Mac or Windows, go to the Apple iTunes page on 
the Web (www.apple.com/itunes), select the appropriate version (Mac or
Windows), and then click the Download iTunes button, as shown in Figure 2-1.
Follow the instructions to download the installer to your hard drive. Pick a
location on your hard drive to save the installer.
32
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Setting up iTunes on a Mac
If you downloaded the iTunes installer, launch the installer to unpack and
install iTunes. To install iTunes from the CD-ROM, open the iTunes folder on
the CD-ROM, and then double-click the iTunes package file (it has an .mpkg
extension) to unpack and install it. 
The Mac version installs iTunes in the Applications folder on the Mac OS X
startup drive. Mac users can proceed by directly launching iTunes and setting
it up with the iTunes Setup Assistant. Follow these steps:
1. Launch iTunes.
Double-click the iTunes application or click the iTunes icon in the Dock.
2. If this is the first time you’ve used iTunes, click the Agree button for
Apple’s License Agreement.
Apple’s License Agreement appears only when you start iTunes for the
first time.

Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

Optional: Before you click the Agree button, you have a few other options.
You can click the Save button to save the license agreement as a document,
the Print button to print it, the Decline button to quit iTunes immediately,
or simply go with the Agree button. No lawyers are present when you do
this; it’s all up to you. 
3. Click Next in the iTunes Setup Assistant opening screen.
The iTunes Setup Assistant takes you through the process of setting up
iTunes for the Internet. After clicking Next, the iTunes Setup Assistant
displays a window with questions.
4. Select Yes or No to answer the following questions:
• Would you like to use iTunes to handle audio content from the
Internet?
We suggest selecting Yes, allowing iTunes to handle audio content,
because iTunes offers more features than you typically find with
browser plug-ins from other companies. On the other hand, if you’re
happy with your plug-ins and helper applications, select No and
leave your Internet settings untouched.
• Do you want iTunes to automatically connect when it’s necessary?
If you use an always-on broadband Internet service, you probably want
iTunes to connect automatically, and you can select Yes. If you use a
dial-up modem, if your Internet service is intermittently off, or if your
Internet service charges when you use it, you probably don’t want this
connection to be automatic. Selecting No forces iTunes to ask first.
After you click Done, the iTunes Setup Assistant also asks whether you
want iTunes to search your home folder for music files. You might want
to click the No button for now because iTunes might find files that you
don’t want to add to your library (such as music for games).
5. The assistant asks whether you want to keep your iTunes music folder
organized. Select Yes or No, and then click Next.
This seems like a no-brainer — the default is Yes, which tells iTunes to
keep your music files organized — iTunes renames and moves files into
appropriate folders when you edit the artist name, song title, album
name, or track number. If you don’t want this type of organization, 
select No.
6. The assistant asks whether you want to go straight to the iTunes Music
Store. Select Yes or No, and then click Next.
We suggest selecting No. However, if you can’t wait to go shopping,
Chapter 4 gives you the scoop on the iTunes Music Store.
7. Click Done.
That’s it — the iTunes window appears. (We unravel the wonders of 
this window in Chapter 3.) You can drag the bottom-right corner of 
your iTunes window to make it larger or smaller on your screen.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Whether or not you set iTunes to automatically connect to the Internet, be sure
to connect to the Internet with iTunes at some point. Doing so allows you to buy
music online and listen to Web radio. You can even retrieve track information
when you insert a CD so that you don’t have to type the information yourself.
Setting up iTunes for Windows
Before installing iTunes for Windows, make sure that you’re logged on as a
Windows Administrator user if you’re using Windows 2000 or Windows XP.
Quit all other applications before installing and disable any virus protection
software.
To install iTunes for Windows, download the iTunesSetup.exe file from the
Apple Web site, as we describe earlier in this chapter (refer to Figure 2-1). 
If for some reason you can’t download this software from the Internet, and
you know for certain that the CD-ROM includes iTunes for Windows, you can
use the CD-ROM to install iTunes. The CD-ROM installation process installs
both iTunes for Windows and the iPod Updater for Windows. See the section
“Setting Up Your iPod with a Windows PC” for information about installing
iTunes for Windows from the CD-ROM.
To install iTunes for Windows, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the iTunesSetup.exe file, which you can download from
the Apple Web site.
The installer comes to life, displaying its opening screen.
2. Click Next to begin installing iTunes for Windows.
After clicking Next, the installer displays a pane in the window with
questions about the type of setup, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Figure 2-2:

Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

3. Select the appropriate options for your iTunes setup, and then 
click Next.
The options are
• Install Desktop Shortcuts: You can install shortcuts for your
Windows desktop for iTunes.
• Use iTunes as the Default Player for Audio Files: We suggest 
turning this on — allowing iTunes to be the default audio content
player — because iTunes offers more features than you typically
find with players and browser plug-ins from other companies. On
the other hand, if you’re happy with your audio player, you can
deselect this option, leaving your default player setting unaffected.
• Use QuickTime as the Default Player for Media Files: We suggest
turning this on — allowing QuickTime to be the default audio multi-
media (including video and audio) player — because QuickTime for
Windows can play just about any media format and is comparable
to players and browser plug-ins from other companies. On the other
hand, if you’re happy with your media player, you can deselect this
option, leaving your default media player setting unaffected.
4. In the Choose Destination Location pane, select a destination folder
for iTunes, and then click Next.
By default, the installer assumes that you want to store the program in
the Program Files folder of your C: drive (which is an excellent place to
store it, unless you have other ideas). If you want to use a different folder,
click Browse to use Windows Explorer to locate the desired folder.
After you click Next, the installer proceeds with its task.
5. When the installer finishes, click Done.
iTunes for Windows is now installed on your PC.
To set iTunes up for your Internet connection and start using it, double-click
the iTunes program or use your Start menu to locate iTunes and launch it.
After that, follow these steps:
1. If this is the first time you’ve used iTunes, click the Agree button for
Apple’s License Agreement.
Apple’s License Agreement appears only when you start iTunes for the
first time.
Optional: Before you click the Agree button, you have a few other options.
You can click the Save button to save the license agreement as a docu-
ment, the Print button to print it, the Decline button to quit iTunes imme-
diately, or simply go with the Agree button. If you don’t agree, you can
consult a lawyer, but you still won’t be able to continue with the setup.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

2. Click Next in the iTunes Setup Assistant opening screen.
The iTunes Setup Assistant takes you through the process of setting up
the Windows version of iTunes for the Internet. After clicking Next, the
Setup Assistant displays a pane that helps you find music files on your
PC, as shown in Figure 2-3.
3. Select or deselect the following options for finding music (by default
they are selected):
• Add MP3 and AAC Files: Select this option if you already have
music files in the AAC format that’s used by iTunes and the iPod —
this option copies those files automatically into iTunes. You 
might want to turn this off, however, because iTunes might find
MP3 files that you don’t want to add to your library (such as 
music for games).
• Add WMA Files: Select this option if you want to add unprotected
Windows Media audio files to your iTunes library. This option auto-
matically converts the WMA files to the AAC format. (For more
information about formats, see Chapter 19.) The original WMA files
are left untouched.
4. The assistant asks whether you want to keep your iTunes music folder
organized. Select Yes or No, and then click Next.
The default is Yes, which tells iTunes to keep your music files organized —
iTunes renames and moves files into appropriate folders when you edit
the artist name, song title, album name, or track number. If you don’t
want this type of organization, click No.

Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

5. The assistant asks whether you want to go straight to the iTunes Music
Store. Select Yes or No, and then click Next.
We suggest selecting No until you are ready to go to the store. (Chapter 4
covers the iTunes Music Store in depth.)
6. Click Finish.
That’s it — the iTunes window appears. (Chapter 3 gives you the full
scoop on this window.) You can drag the bottom-right corner or the
edges of your iTunes window to make it larger or smaller on your screen.
Setting Up Your iPod with a Mac
To set up your iPod with a Mac, connect it to the Mac by using your FireWire
cable — unless you use an iPod mini and have a Mac that offers USB 2.0, in
which case you can use the USB cable. We describe connecting to a Mac in
Chapter 1.
As with the iTunes software, the version of the iPod software that’s provided
with your iPod on CD-ROM might not be the newest version. Even minor
changes to the software might mean new iPod features or better performance
with your battery. Updates to the iPod software occur frequently. If you want
the latest version, go directly to the Apple Web site to get it. You can download
the iPod software for free.
You can set your Mac to automatically download the latest version of the iPod
software when it becomes available — just use Software Update from the Mac
OS X System Preferences window. Click the Check Now button to check for a
new version. If one exists, it appears in a window for you to select. Select it
and click Install to download and install it.
To download the iPod software, go to Apple’s iPod download page on the
Web (www.apple.com/ipod/download) and select the appropriate version
(Mac or Windows). Follow the instructions to download the installer to your
hard drive. Pick a location on your hard drive to save the installer. Then launch
the installer to unpack and install the iPod software.
Apple pre-installs the iPod software on Apple-branded models so that you
can use it right away with iTunes on a Mac. The extra step of downloading
and installing iPod software ensures that you have the newest version and
that you can restore the iPod if necessary (as we describe in Chapter 28).
38
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

When you first connect your iPod to a Mac, the iTunes Setup Assistant appears
like a butler, ready to help you set it up, as shown in Figure 2-4. In this dialog
you can give your iPod a name, which is a good idea if you plan on sharing
several iPods among several computers.
In the iTunes Setup Assistant, you can decide whether to update your iPod
automatically or manually. If this is your first time using an iPod, you probably
want to fill it up right away, so leave the Automatically Update My iPod option
selected. (Don’t worry. You can always change it later; see Chapter 11.) If you
want to copy only a portion of your library to the iPod, deselect (clear) this
option.
The iTunes Setup Assistant allows you to register your iPod with Apple to take
advantage of Apple support. When you reach the last dialog, click Done. iTunes
automatically launches, and your iPod’s name appears in the iTunes Source
pane under the Music Store. If you selected the automatic update feature in
the iTunes Setup Assistant, the iPod name appears grayed out in the Source
pane, and you can’t open it. However, your iPod quickly fills up with the music
from your iTunes music library — that is, if you have music in your library.
If you deselected the automatic update feature, the iPod name appears just like
any other source in the Source pane, and you can open it and play songs on
the iPod through iTunes and your Mac speakers, as we describe in Chapter 18.
Of course, if you’re just starting out, you probably have no tunes in your library.
Your next step is to import music from CDs, buy music online, or import music
from other sources.
Figure 2-4:

Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

After finishing setup, the iPod icon also appears on the Finder Desktop. If you
leave your iPod connected to the Mac, the iPod appears on the Desktop and
in iTunes whenever you start iTunes.
To see how much free space is left on the iPod, click the iPod icon on the
desktop and choose File➪Get Info. The Finder displays the Get Info window
with information about capacity, amount used, and available space. You can
also use the About command on the iPod, which is available in the Settings
menu: Choose Settings➪About. The iPod information screen appears with
capacity and available space.
Setting Up Your iPod with a Windows PC
To use an iPod with Windows, you have to run the iPod installer to reformat
the iPod for Windows and install the Windows version of the iPod software.
Before installing the iPod software for Windows, make sure that you’re 
logged on as a Windows Administrator user if you’re using Windows 2000 
or Windows XP. Quit all other applications before installing, and disable 
any virus protection software.
The version of the iPod software for Windows provided on the CD-ROM with
your iPod might not be the newest version. Therefore, we recommend going
directly to the Apple Web site and downloading the latest version.
If you bought your iPod before the fall of 2003, the CD-ROM that came with it
installs MusicMatch Jukebox. Don’t use the CD-ROM from older iPods if you
plan on using iTunes for Windows — download the newer iTunes and iPod
installers from the Apple Web site.
If you use Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you can use iTunes for Windows. If
you use any other Windows version, you need to install MusicMatch Jukebox
from the iPod CD-ROM. (We cover MusicMatch Jukebox in Chapter 7.)
To download the iPod software for Windows, go to Apple’s iPod download page
on the Web (www.apple.com/ipod/download) and click the iPod software
link. Follow the instructions to download the installer to your hard drive. 
Pick a location on your hard drive to save the installer.
To install the iPod software for Windows, follow these steps:
1. Double-click the Setup.exe file, which you can download from the
Apple Web site.
40
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

2. In the first dialog that appears, choose the language that you want to
use, and then click OK.
The language shortcut menu lets you choose from quite a number of dif-
ferent languages. After clicking OK, the InstallShield Wizard so familiar to
Windows users takes over and launches the installer.
3. Click Next (or Cancel to quit).
4. In the Choose Destination Location pane, select a destination folder
for the iPod Update folder, and then click Next.
The iPod folder contains the iPod Update folder that in turn contains the
iPod Updater program. By default, the installer assumes that you want to
store the iPod folder in the Program Files folder of your C: drive (which
is just peachy, unless you like to defy the system designers at Microsoft by
putting programs in other places). Click Browse to use Windows Explorer
to locate a different folder if you dare. After selecting a folder (or keeping
the default), click Next.
5. Select the Yes option or the No option to determine whether your
system restarts after finishing your installation, and then click Finish.
By all means, select the Yes option to restart your computer — after all,
you don’t know where it’s been or what it was doing before you arrived
with this new software. Restarting cleans out memory and starts Windows
over again. Select the No option only if you prefer to live dangerously or
need to install more software.
As of this writing, the CD-ROMs that are supplied with iPods offer iTunes for
Windows and the iPod Updater program in one installation. However, the
CD-ROM might not contain the newest versions of these programs. The Apple
Web site offers free downloads. 
If you have no other choice, you can install from the CD-ROM and then update
your software later from the Apple Web site. The CD-ROM’s AutoPlay feature
starts the installation process; if the installer doesn’t open automatically, right-
click the CD-ROM icon in the My Computer window and choose AutoPlay from
the shortcut menu that appears (see Figure 2-5). Follow the instructions to
type in your iPod serial number, and click Next for each window. The CD-ROM
installation performs the same process as installing iTunes and the iPod soft-
ware separately.
After your system starts up, you can launch the iPod Updater program by
double-clicking the program icon or choosing it from the Start menu (Start➪
iPod➪iPod Updater). If you install from the CD-ROM, the iPod Updater program
launches automatically.
41
Chapter 2: Setting Up iTunes and Your iPod

Connect your iPod by using a FireWire or a USB 2.0 hookup, which are avail-
able on most desktop PCs and laptops. To read more about this choice, see
Chapter 1.
After connecting your iPod to the PC, the iPod Updater displays a dialog asking
whether you want to configure the iPod. Click OK, and the iPod Updater dis-
plays a dialog for updating or restoring your iPod, as shown in Figure 2-6. 
The only option with a new iPod is to click Restore.

The Restore function clears all settings and reformats the iPod to the Windows
hard drive format, preparing it for use. After you click Restore, the iPod Updater
displays a warning dialog.
Click Restore to continue with the restoration. If you’re restoring an iPod that
you bought prior to 2004, the iPod Updater displays the message in Figure 2-7,
asking you to disconnect your iPod and connect it to a power supply so that
it can do a firmware refresh. (Firmware is software encoded in hardware.)
Disconnect your iPod carefully, and then connect it to your power adapter.
The iPod performs a firmware refresh operation that takes a few minutes.
After the operation is complete, the iPod Updater displays its opening dialog.
Close the iPod Updater by clicking the X-marked close box in the upper-right
corner.

Getting Started with iTunes
In This Chapter

 Displaying visuals while playing music
M
ore than half a century ago, jukeboxes were the primary and most 
convenient way for people to select the music they wanted to hear and
share with others, especially newly released music. Juke joints were hopping
with the newest hits every night; however, you still had to insert coins to play
songs. Possibly, you could afford records and a turntable, but you had to throw
a party to share the music with others. 
Today, using iTunes, you can create a digital jukebox and conveniently click 
a button to play a song. Connect your computer to a stereo amplifier in your
home or connect speakers to your computer, and suddenly your computer is
the best jukebox in the neighborhood.
This chapter explains how iTunes changes your music-playing and -buying
habits for the better, and it covers how to set up and configure iTunes for
your Internet connection. It also describes playing music tracks on a CD. 
(If you plan on using MusicMatch Jukebox on your Windows PC instead of
iTunes, see Chapter 7.)
What You Can Do with iTunes
You can listen to a new song on the Internet and download it to iTunes imme-
diately. You can also buy music online at the iTunes Music Store. iTunes down-
loads music from the store and puts it in your library, making it immediately
available for playing, burning onto a CD, or transferring to an iPod. You can
even use iTunes to listen to Web radio stations and add your favorite stations
to your music library.

Transferring songs from a CD to your computer is called ripping a CD (to the
chagrin of the music industry old-timers who think that users intend to destroy
the discs or steal the songs). Ripping an entire CD’s worth of songs is quick
and easy, and track information, such as artist name and title, arrives auto-
matically over the Internet.
iTunes gives you the power to organize songs into playlists and burn any set
of songs in your library to CD, in any order. You can even set up dynamic smart
playlists that reflect your preferences and listening habits. iTunes offers an
equalizer with preset settings for all kinds of music and listening environments,
and it gives you the ability to customize and save your own personalized set-
tings with each song.
The Mac and Windows versions of iTunes are virtually identical, with the
exception that dialogs look a bit different between the two operating systems.
There are also a few other differences, mostly related to the different operating
environments — the Windows version lets you import Windows Media (WMA)
songs, while the Mac version, like most Mac applications, can be controlled by
Applescripts. Nevertheless, as Apple continues to improve iTunes, the com-
pany releases upgrades to both versions at the same time, and the versions
are free to download.
The iTunes Window
You can run iTunes anytime to add music and manage your music library.
You don’t have to connect your iPod until you’re ready to transfer music to it
(as we describe in Chapter 11), or play the music on the iPod rather than the
music in the library (as we describe in Chapter 18).
When you launch iTunes, your music library and other sources of music
appear. Figure 3-1 shows the iTunes window on the Mac, and Figure 3-2 
shows it in Windows.
The iTunes window offers a view of your music library and your sources 
for music, as well as controls for organizing, importing, and playing music, 
as follows:
 Source pane: Displays the source of your music — Library (your music
library), Party Shuffle (a dynamic playlist), Radio (access to Web radio),
Music Store (the iTunes Music Store), your iPod (if it’s connected), and
your playlists.
 Song List pane and Browse pane: Depending on the source that’s selected
in the Source pane, these panes display the songs in your music library,
46
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

your playlist, your iPod, or Web radio stations. The Browse button in the
upper-right corner toggles between Browse view (with the Song List pane
below and the Browse pane above with genre, artist, and album) and the
Song List pane by itself.
 Status pane: When a song is playing, this displays the name of the artist
and song (if known) and the elapsed time.
 Search field: Type characters in this field to search your music library.
 Player buttons — Forward/Next, Play/Pause, and Previous/Rewind:
Control the playback of songs in iTunes. 
 Playlist buttons — Add, Shuffle, Repeat: Add playlists, and shuffle or
repeat playback of playlists.
 Miscellaneous buttons — Show/Hide Artwork, Equalizer, Turn on visual
effects, Eject: Display or hide song artwork (supplied with purchased
songs), the equalizer, and visual effects. The Eject button ejects a CD or
iPod — while a CD will actually pop out of some computers, iPods are
hard drives, and ejecting them simply removes (or un-mounts) the drives
from the system.

If you don’t like the width of the Source pane, you can adjust it by dragging
the shallow dot on the vertical bar between the Source pane and the Song List
pane and Browse pane. You can also adjust the height of the Song List and
Browse panes by dragging the shallow dot on the horizontal bar between them.
To resize the iTunes window in Windows, drag the edges of the window hori-
zontally or vertically. On a Mac, drag diagonally from the bottom-right corner.
Playing CD Tracks in iTunes
iTunes needs music. You can get started right away with ripping music from
CDs into your library, but for more instant gratification, you can play music
right off the CD without importing it. Maybe you don’t want to put the music
into your library yet. Maybe you just want to hear it first, as part of your Play
First, Rip Later plan.
Insert any music CD or even a CD-R that someone burned for you. The music
tracks appear in the iTunes song list. The Browse button changes to an Import
button when a CD is inserted, in anticipation of importing (or ripping) the CD.

The songs first appear in your song list as generic unnamed tracks. If your com-
puter is connected to the Internet, and you selected Yes for the Automatically
Connect to the Internet question in the iTunes Setup Assistant (see Chapter 2),
you can usually get real song information immediately without having to type
anything. After you insert the CD, iTunes displays a message about accessing
the Gracenote CDDB database on the Internet, and then presents the track
information for each song automatically, as shown in Figure 3-3. (Gracenote
CDDB is a song database on the Internet that knows the track names of com-
mercial CDs. You can read about it and editing song information, in Chapter 9.)
When you play a CD in iTunes, it’s just like using a CD player. To play a CD
from the first track, click the Play button. (If you clicked somewhere else after
inserting the disc, you may have to click the first track to select it before click-
ing the Play button.) The Play button then turns into a Pause button, and the
song plays.
When the song finishes, iTunes continues playing the songs in the list in
sequence until you click the Pause button (which then toggles back into the
Play button). You can skip to the next or previous song by using the arrow
keys on your keyboard, or by clicking the Forward button or the Back button
next to the Play button. You can also double-click another song in the list to
start playing it.
You can press the space bar to perform the same function as clicking the Play
button; pressing it again is just like clicking the Pause button.
Figure 3-3:

Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes

The Status pane above the list of songs tells you the name of the artist or the
song title (if known), as well as the elapsed time of the track. When you click
the artist name, the artist name disappears, and the song title appears; if you
click the song title, the artist name comes back up. If you click the Elapsed
Time status, the status changes to the remaining time and then, with another
click, to the total time. (One more click brings you back to the elapsed time.)
Eject a CD by clicking the Eject button or by choosing Controls➪Eject Disc.
Another way to eject the CD is to click the eject icon next to the CD’s name 
in the Source pane. You can also right-click the CD’s name and choose Eject
from the contextual menu.
Rearranging and repeating tracks
You can rearrange the order of the tracks to automatically play them in any
sequence you want — similar to programming a CD player. Click the upward-
pointing arrow at the top of the first column in the song list, and it changes to
a downward-pointing arrow, and the tracks appear in reverse order.
To change the order of tracks that you’re playing in sequence, just click and
hold on the track number in the leftmost column for the song, and then drag
it up or down in the list. You can set up the tracks to play in a completely dif-
ferent sequence.
Skipping tracks
To skip tracks so that they don’t play in sequence, deselect the check box
next to the song names. iTunes skips deselected songs when you play the
entire sequence.
To remove all check marks from a list, simultaneously hold down the Ô key
on a Mac (or the Ctrl key in Windows) while clicking a check mark. Select an
empty check box while pressing Ô/Ctrl to add check marks to the entire list.
Repeating a song list
You can repeat an entire song list by clicking the Repeat button below 
the Source pane on the left side of the iTunes window (or by choosing
Controls➪Repeat All). When it’s selected, the Repeat button icon changes to
50
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

show blue highlighting. Click the Repeat button again to repeat the current
song (or choose Controls➪Repeat One). The icon changes to include a blue-
highlighted numeral 1. Click it once more to return to normal playback (or
choose Controls➪Repeat Off).
The Shuffle button, located to the left of the Repeat button, plays the songs in
the list in a random order, which can be fun. You can then press the arrow keys
on your keyboard or click the Back and Forward buttons to jump around in
random order.
Displaying visuals
The visual effects in iTunes can turn your display into a light show that’s syn-
chronized to the music in your library. You can watch a cool visual display of
eye candy while the music plays — or leave it on like a lava lamp. You can also
add more visual effects as plug-ins to iTunes, as we describe in Chapter 23.
Click the Visual Effects button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes window
to display visual effects. The visual animation appears in the iTunes window
and synchronizes with the music.
In addition to the animation replacing the iTunes song list, an Options button
replaces the Import button in the upper-right corner of the iTunes window.
You can click the Options button to open the Visualizer Options dialog, as
shown in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4:
Set options
for visual
effects.
51
Chapter 3: Getting Started with iTunes

The Visualizer Options dialog offers the following options that affect the ani-
mation (but not the performance of iTunes when it’s playing music):
 Display Frame Rate: Displays the frame rate of the animation along with
the animation.
 Cap Frame Rate at 30 fps: Keeps the frame rate at 30 fps (frames per
second) or lower, which is the speed of normal video.
 Always Display Song Info: Displays the song name, artist, and album for
the song currently playing, along with the animation.
 Use OpenGL: You can choose to use OpenGL, the most widely used stan-
dard for three-dimensional graphics programming, to display very cool
animation with faster performance.
 Faster but Rougher Display: The animation plays faster, with rougher
graphics. Select this option if your animation plays too slowly.
The Visualizer menu in iTunes gives you even more control over visual effects.
You can choose Visualizer➪Small or Visualizer➪Medium to display the visual
effects in a rectangle inside the iTunes window, or choose Visualizer➪Large to
fill the iTunes window. Choosing Visualizer➪Full Screen sets the visual effects
to fill up the entire screen. When displaying the full-screen visual effects, you
can click the mouse or press Escape (Esc) to stop the display and return to
iTunes. Choosing Visualizer➪Turn Visualizer On is the same as clicking the
Visual Effects button: It displays the visual effects.
While the animated visual effects play, press Shift-/ (like when you type a ques-
tion mark) to see a list of keyboard functions. Depending on the visual effect,
you might see more choices of keyboard functions by pressing Shift-/ again.
To turn off the visual effects display, click the Visual Effects button again. You
can leave the effects on (except when in full-screen mode) even while opening
the equalizer because you still have access to the playback controls.

W
hen Apple announced its new music service, Apple chairman Steve
Jobs remarked that other services put forward by the music industry
tend to treat consumers like criminals. Steve had a point. Many of these ser-
vices cost more and add a level of copy protection that prevents consumers
from burning CDs or using the music they bought on other computers or
portable MP3 players.
Record labels had been dragging their feet for years, experimenting with
online sales and taking legal action against online sites, such as Napster, that
allowed free downloads and music copying. Although the free music attracted
millions of listeners, the free services were under legal attack in several coun-
tries, and the digital music that was distributed wasn’t of the highest quality
(not to mention the widespread and sometimes intentional misspellings in the
song information and artist names). Consumers grew even warier when the
Record Industry Association of America (RIAA), a legal organization looking
out for the interests of record companies, began legal proceedings against
people for illegal copyright infringement — people who possibly thought
they were downloading free music.

No one should go to jail for being a music junkie. Consumers and the industry
both needed a solution, so Apple did the research on how to make a service
that worked better and was easier to use, and the company forged ahead with
the iTunes Music Store. By all accounts, Apple has succeeded in offering the
easiest, fastest, and most cost-effective service for buying music online for
your computer and your iPod. The iTunes Music Store even offers gift certifi-
cates that you can e-mail to others and allowance accounts that you can set
up for others (such as children) with credit limits but without the need to use
a credit card. Apple adds new features to the store almost every week.
In this chapter, we show you how to sign in and take advantage of what the
iTunes Music Store has to offer.
Visiting the iTunes Music Store
You can visit the iTunes Music Store by connecting to the Internet and using
either iTunes or America Online (AOL).
As of this writing, the iTunes Music Store offers at least a half-million songs,
with most songs available for download at the price of 99 cents each and
entire albums available for download at less price than the CD. You can play
the songs on up to five different computers, burn your own CDs, and use
them on players, such as the iPod. The store also offers audio books from
Audible.com.
The iTunes Music Store is part of iTunes version 4 and newer. If you’re running
an older version of iTunes, download the newest version, as we describe in
Chapter 2.
You can preview any song for up to 30 seconds, and if you have an account
set up, you can buy and download the song immediately. We don’t know of a
faster way to get a song.
To open the iTunes Music Store, you have three options:
 Click the Music Store option in the Source pane. This opens the Music
Store’s home page, as shown in Figure 4-1. 
 Follow a music link in iTunes. Click the music link (the gray-circled arrow
next to a song title, artist name, or album title) to go to a Music Store
page related to the song, artist, or album. iTunes performs a search in
54
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

the Music Store by using the song information. If nothing closely related
turns up, at least you end up in the Music Store, and you might even find
music you like that you didn’t know about.
 Go to iTunes on AOL and click the iTunes link. If you use AOL, you can
browse or search the AOL music area for songs and click the iTunes link
to automatically launch iTunes and go to the Music Store.
If you need to fire up your modem and log on to your Internet service to go
online, do so before clicking the Music Store option or following a music link.
The Music Store replaces the iTunes Song List and Browse panes. You can
check out artists and songs to your heart’s content although you can’t buy
songs unless you have a Music Store account set up. You can use the Choose
Genre pop-up menu to specify music genres, or click links for new releases,
exclusive tracks, and so on — just like any other music service on the Web.

Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

We use the term pop-up menu for menus on the Mac that literally pop up from
dialogs and windows; the same type of menu in Windows actually drops down
and is also called a drop-down menu. We use pop-up menu for both.
The iTunes Music Store also provides buttons on a gray bar just above the
Song List pane and Browse pane. The left and right triangle buttons work just
like the Back and Forward buttons of a Web browser, moving back a page or
forward a page. The button with the Home icon takes you to the iTunes Music
Store home page. The Browse button in the upper-right corner switches the
view between Browse view (with the Song List and Browse panes both open)
and Song List view (with only the Song List pane open).
Setting up an account
To create an iTunes Music Store account, follow these steps:
1. In iTunes, click the Music Store option in the Source pane or follow a
music link.
The Music Store’s home page appears (refer to Figure 4-1), replacing the
iTunes Song List pane and Browse pane.
2. Click the Sign In button in the upper-right area of the window to
create an account or sign in to an existing account.
If you don’t have an account, the button next to Account on the gray bar
reads “Sign In.” If you already have an account, the account name appears
in place of the Sign In button. You need an account to buy music. After
clicking the Sign In button, iTunes displays the account sign-in dialog, as
shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2:

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

If you already set up an account with the Apple Store, with the .Mac 
service, or with AOL, you’re halfway there. Type in your ID and pass-
word, and then click the Sign In button. Apple remembers the personal
information that you put in previously, so you don’t have to re-enter it
every time you visit the Music Store. If you forgot your password, click
the Forgot Password? button, and iTunes provides a dialog to answer
your test question. If you answer correctly, iTunes then e-mails your
password to you.
3. If you aren’t signed up yet, click the Create New Account button. 
iTunes displays a new page, replacing the iTunes Music Store home page
with the terms of use and an explanation of steps to create a new account.
4. Click the Agree button, and then fill in your personal account 
information.
iTunes displays the next page of the setup procedure, which requires
you to type your e-mail address, password, test question and answer 
(in case you forget your password), birth date, and privacy options.
5. Click the Continue button to go to the next page of the account setup
procedure, and then enter your credit card information.
The entire procedure is secure, so you don’t have to worry. The Music
Store keeps your personal information (including your credit card infor-
mation) on file, and you don’t have to type it again.
6. Click Done to finish the procedure.
You can now use the iTunes Music Store to purchase and download
music to play in iTunes and use on an iPod.
If you use AOL and the AOL Wallet feature, you can assign payment for your
Music Store account to your AOL Wallet. AOL Wallet contains your billing and
credit card information for purchases. Use AOL Wallet to fill out your personal
information. AOL Wallet automatically fills information into the text boxes of
the account setup pages so that you don’t have to.
Browsing for artists, songs, and albums
The iTunes Music Store home page is loaded with specials and advertise-
ments to peruse. You can also use the Genre pop-up menu to see only those
specials and ads for a particular genre. You can click just about anything on
the home page to get more information: today’s top ten songs, exclusive
offerings, albums, artists’ names, and more.
57
Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

What if you’re just looking for a song or album by a particular artist? You 
can browse the store by genre and artist name in a method similar to brows-
ing your iTunes library. To browse the store, click the Browse button in the
top-right corner of the iTunes window. iTunes displays the store’s offerings
categorized by genre, and within each genre, by artist and album. Click a
genre in the left column, then an artist in the middle column, and then an
album in the right column, which takes you to the list of songs from that
album that are available to preview or purchase, as shown in Figure 4-3.
To see more information about a song or the album that it came from, click
the music link (one of the gray-circled arrow buttons in the song list):
 Clicking the arrow in the Artist column takes you to the artist’s page of
albums.
 Clicking the arrow in the Album column takes you to the album page.
 Clicking the arrow in the Genre column takes you back to the genre’s
specials page (or the home page).
Our only complaint about browsing by artist is that artists are listed alpha-
betically by first name — you have to look up Bob Dylan under Bob.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

If you know specifically what you’re looking for, you can search rather than
browse. The Search field in the top-right corner of the iTunes window lets you
search the iTunes Music Store for just about anything. First make a selection
in the Genre column, type the name of an artist, and then press Return. Type
more letters of the song title or artist name to narrow your search or use the
Power Search feature. (See the “Power-searching” section, later in this chapter.)
Browsing the charts
What do Louis Armstrong, Roy Orbison, the Beach Boys, Dean Martin, and
Mary Wells have in common? Each one had a top-ten hit in the charts for 1964.
So says Billboard, the weekly magazine for the entertainment industry that
has kept tabs on song popularity for more than half a century. The iTunes
Music Store offers pop charts for each year going back to 1946, so you can
probably find some of the songs that you grew up with.
You can’t find every song that made the charts — only the songs that the
iTunes Music Store offers. Although the store has over half a million songs,
the store has still many more millions of songs not yet licensed for sale.
To find the charts, click the Billboard Charts link in the list of Music Store
links on the home page, or browse the store and select Charts at the very top
of the Genre column. From the Charts column, you can select Billboard Hot
100, Billboard Top Country, or Billboard Top R&B.
Don’t like the songs that Billboard chose? Try selecting Radio Charts from the
Genre column, and then pick a city in the United States in the middle column.
Now you can find out what songs are hits in your hometown, no matter where
you are at the moment.
Power-searching
You’re serious about music, and you want the power to search for exactly
what you want. Click the Power Search link on the iTunes Music Store home
page to go to the Power Search page, as shown in Figure 4-4.
You can fill in the song title, the artist name, and the album title, or just fill in
one of those text boxes (for example, if all you know is the song title). You
can narrow your search by picking a genre from the Genre pop-up menu and
by adding a composer name. After you fill in as much as you know, click the
Search button.

Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

Playing music videos and movie trailers
Music videos and movie trailers are just a click away, and they’re free to
watch. The Music Video link on the iTunes Music Store home page takes you
to a Music Store page. Click a thumbnail or title to select a video, and then
select a small video window size (240 x 180 pixels) for quicker downloading
or a large video window size (480 x 360 pixels).
It might take some time to download the video before it starts to play. After
the QuickTime player controls appear in the iTunes window, as shown in
Figure 4-5, you can click the movie’s Play button (the right triangle next to 
the Sound button) to play the video.
You can play music in your iTunes library while waiting for a Music Store page
or video to download over the Internet. Double-click the Music Store option
in the Source pane to open the Music Store in a separate window. With two
windows, you can use the first window to play music in your library while
using the second to browse the Music Store and download a video. The first
windows stops playing music when you use the second window to play a
video or select a song to preview or buy.

Browsing celebrity and published playlists
Do you want to be influenced? Do you want to know what influenced some of
today’s music celebrities and buy what they have in their record collections?
Scroll down the iTunes Music Store home page and click a celebrity name in
the Celebrity Playlists panel, or click the Celebrity Playlists link to go to the
page of celebrity playlists.
A typical celebrity playlist offers about an album’s worth of songs from differ-
ent artists. You can preview or buy any song in the list or follow the music links
to the artist or album page.
The Music Store home page lists some of the celebrity playlists, but a lot more
aren’t listed there (78 the last time we checked). To see all the celebrity play-
lists, click the See All button at the bottom of the panel of Celebrity Playlist
links on the home page.
You can also be influenced by other Music Store buyers and do a little influ-
encing yourself. Click the iMix link on the Music Store home page to check out
playlists that have been contributed by other consumers and published in the
Music Store. iMixes offer 30-second previews of any songs in the playlist.

Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

Previewing a song
The cool thing about record stores, besides being able to hang out and meet
people, is the ability to preview CDs before you buy them. You can’t meet
flesh-and-blood people in the online iTunes Music Store, but you can preview
songs before you buy them. To preview a song, click the song title in the song
list, and then click the Play button or press the space bar.
By default, the previews play on your computer off the Internet in a stream,
so you might hear a few hiccups in the playback. Each preview lasts about 
30 seconds. Just when you start really getting into the song, it ends — but if
the song is irresistible, you can buy it on the spot.
Buying and Downloading Songs
After setting up an account, you can purchase songs and download each one
to your computer immediately, or gather them in a virtual shopping cart first,
to see your choices and decide whether or not to purchase them before down-
loading them all at once. 
Depending on how you set up your account, you can download the song
immediately with the 1-Click option or place the song in your Music Store
Shopping Cart temporarily, to purchase and download later. You can change
your Music Store shopping method at any time.
After the song downloads, it appears in your iTunes song list. Purchased
songs also appear in a special Purchased Music playlist under the Music
Store option in the Source pane. You can see the list of all the songs that 
you purchased by clicking the triangle to expand the Music Store option 
in the Source pane, and then clicking the Purchased Music option. The 
Song List pane and Browse pane change to show the list of songs that 
you purchased.
Using 1-Click or the Shopping Cart
Apple offers 1-Click technology in the iTunes Music Store so that with one
click, the song immediately starts downloading to your computer — and the
purchase is done.
62
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

With 1-Click, you select a song and click the Buy Song button at the far right
of the song. (You might have to scroll down your iTunes Music Store window.)
The store displays a warning dialog to make sure that you want to buy the song,
and you can then go through with it or cancel. If you click the Buy button to
purchase the song, the song downloads automatically and shows up in your
iTunes library. The Music Store keeps track of your purchases over a 24-hour
period and charges a total sum rather than for each single purchase.
1-Click seems more like two clicks. If you really want to use only one click 
to buy a song, select the Don’t Warn Me About Buying Songs option in the
warning dialog so that you never see it again.
You don’t have to use the 1-Click technology. Instead, you can add songs to
the Shopping Cart to delay purchasing and downloading until you’re ready.
With the Shopping Cart, the store remembers your selections, allowing you
to browse the store at different times and add to your Shopping Cart without
making any purchases final. You can also remove items from the cart at any
time. When you’re ready to buy, you can purchase and download the songs in
your cart at once.
Your decision to download each song immediately or add to a Shopping Cart
and download later is likely based on how your computer connects to the
Internet. If you have a slow connection such as a phone line, you probably
want to use the Shopping Cart, so that you don’t tie up the phone with each
download.
If you switch to the Shopping Cart method (see the following section, “Changing
your Store preferences”), the Buy Song button toggles to an Add Song button.
After adding songs, you can view your Shopping Cart by clicking the triangle
next to the Music Store option in the Source pane to show the Music Store
selections (see Figure 4-6), and click the Shopping Cart option. The Shopping
Cart appears with your purchases listed in the Song List pane, and recommen-
dations from the store appear along the top of the window.
When you’re ready to purchase everything in your Shopping Cart, click the
Buy Now button in the lower-right corner of the Shopping Cart window to
close the sale and download all the songs at once. You can alternatively click
the Buy (for an album) or Buy Song buttons for each item that you want to
purchase.
To delete items from your Shopping Cart, select them and press Delete/
Backspace. A warning appears asking whether you’re sure that you want to
remove the selected items. Click Yes to go ahead and remove the selections
from your Shopping Cart.
63
Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

Changing your Store preferences
You can change your shopping method by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on
the Mac or by choosing Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC. In the Preferences
window, click the Store button. The Store Preferences window appears. You
can set the following features:
 Change from 1-Click to Shopping Cart or vice versa. 1-Click is the default.
 If you select the Play Songs After Downloading option, the songs that
you buy start playing as soon as they complete download to your iTunes
library.
 For better playing performance (fewer hiccups) with previews over slow
Internet connections, select the Load a Complete Preview before Playing
option. (It’s deselected by default.)
If you use more than one computer with your Music Store account, you can set
the preferences for each computer differently and still use the same account.
For example, your home computer might have a faster connection than your
laptop on the road, and you can set your iTunes preferences accordingly —
the home computer could be set to 1-Click, and the laptop could be set to
Shopping Cart.

Resuming interrupted downloads
All sales are final — you can’t return the digital merchandise. However, you
have to receive all of it before the Music Store charges you for the purchase.
If for any reason the download is interrupted or fails to complete, your order
remains active until you connect to the store again.
iTunes remembers to continue the download when you return to iTunes and
connect to the Internet. If for some reason the download doesn’t continue,
choose Advanced➪Check for Purchased Music to continue the interrupted
download. You can also use this command to check for any purchased music
that hasn’t downloaded yet.
If your computer’s hard drive crashes and you lose your information, you
also lose your songs — you have to purchase and download them again.
However, you can mitigate this kind of disaster by backing up your music
library, which we describe in detail in Chapter 13. You can also burn your
purchased songs onto an audio CD, as we describe in Chapter 14. 
Redeeming gift certificates 
and prepaid cards
If you’re the fortunate recipient of an iTunes Music Store gift certificate, all you
need to do is go to the Music Store in iTunes and set up a new account if you
don’t already have one. Recipients of gift certificates can set up new accounts
without having to provide a credit card number. As a recipient of a gift, you
can simply click None for the credit card option and use the gift certificate as
the sole payment method.
You can receive gift certificates on paper, delivered by the postal service, or
by e-mail; you can also receive a prepaid card with a fixed balance. To redeem
a certificate, click the Gift Certificate link on the iTunes Music Store home
page, and then click the Redeem Now button. Then type the number printed
on the lower-right edge of the certificate or supplied in the e-mail, click the
Redeem button to credit your account, and then sign in to your account or
set up an account. To redeem the amount of a prepaid card, click the Prepaid
Cards link on the iTunes Music Store home page, click the Redeem button
now, and then sign in or set up your account.
65
Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

If you use Apple’s Mail program, you can redeem a gift certificate that was
sent by e-mail by clicking the Redeem Now button at the bottom of the e-mail
message. This button launches iTunes with the Music Store option selected in
the Source pane, and the certificate’s number shows up automatically. Click
the Redeem button to credit your account, and then sign in to your account
(if you already have an account), or set up an account (see “Setting up an
account,” earlier in this chapter).
The balance of your gift certificate (how much you have left to spend) appears
right next to your account name in the iTunes Music Store window and is
updated as you make purchases.
Managing Your Account
Online stores record necessary information about you, such as your credit
card number, your billing address, and so forth. You can change this infor-
mation at any time, and you can also take advantage of Music Store account 
features, such as sending gift certificates and setting up allowance accounts.
Viewing and changing 
account information
Life is unpredictable. As John Lennon sang in “Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy),”
“Life is what happens to you while you’re busy making other plans.” So if your
billing address changes, or you need to switch to another credit card, or you
need to change your password for any reason, you can edit your account
information at any time.
To see your account information in the Music Store, click the Account button
that shows your account name. iTunes displays a dialog for you to enter your
account password. You then click the View Account button to see your account
in the store.
Your account page displays your Apple ID, the last four digits of the credit
card that you use for the account, your billing address, your most recent 
purchase, and your computer authorizations. (See “Authorizing computers 
to play purchased music,” later in this chapter.) You can click buttons to edit
your account information and credit card and to buy or redeem gift certificates
and set up allowances.
66
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Viewing your purchase history
In the rock ’n’ roll lifestyle, you might recall songs from the 60s but not remem-
ber what you bought last week. To view your purchase history, go to your
account page by clicking the Account button and typing your password in the
dialog that appears. Click the View Account button, and on your account page,
click the Purchase History button.
The Music Store displays the songs that you purchased, starting with the
most recent.
If you bought a lot of songs, not all of them appear on the first page. To see
the details of previous purchases, click the arrow to the left of the order date.
After viewing your history, click Done at the bottom of the history page to
return to your account page.
Setting up allowances 
Do you trust your kids with your credit card? You don’t have to answer that —
you can sidestep the entire issue by providing an allowance account for that
special someone who wants to buy music on your credit card. With an allow-
ance account, you can set the amount of credit to allow for the account each
month — from $10–$200 in increments of $10. You can change the amount of
an allowance or stop it at any time.
To use an allowance account, the recipient must be using iTunes version 4 or
newer and live in a country where the iTunes Music Store is available on the
Internet (such as the United States).
You can set up the allowance account yourself or define an allowance on an
existing account. The recipient signs in to the account and types his or her
password — no credit card required. When the recipient reaches the limit 
of the allowance, that account can’t buy anything else until the following
month. iTunes Music Store saves any unused balance until the next Music
Store purchase.
To set up an allowance account, click the Allowance link on the Music Store
home page. iTunes takes you to the Allowance page in the Music Store, where
you can enter your name, your recipient’s name, the monthly allowance
amount (using the Monthly Allowance pop-up menu), and your recipient’s
Apple ID and password.
67
Chapter 4: Buying Music from the iTunes Music Store

Click Continue to proceed with the account setup process, and then follow
the instructions to finish setting up the account.
To stop an allowance or change the amount of an allowance account, go to
your account page by clicking the Account button that shows your account
name, and then type your password in the dialog that appears. Click the View
Account button and scroll the account page until you see the Setup Allowance
button; click this button to go to the Allowance page.
Sending gift certificates
A song is a gift that keeps on giving every time the recipient plays the song.
You can’t go wrong giving a Music Store gift certificate to that special person
who has everything. New songs are introduced every day, and another half-
million songs are available spanning every type of musical genre.
Before sending a gift certificate, first make sure that the recipient can run
iTunes 4. (You might want to subtly suggest to the future recipient, in an e-mail,
that it’s time to download iTunes, just to find out whether he or she has the
requisite system configuration.) On a Mac, iTunes requires Mac OS X 10.1.5
or newer, a 400 MHz G3 processor or better, and at least 256MB of RAM.
The recipient also needs iTunes version 4 or newer (4.6 is the newest as of
this writing) and QuickTime, which anyone can download from the Apple
Web site for free (but most Macs already have it). On a PC, iTunes requires
Windows 2000 or XP, a 500 MHz Pentium-class processor or faster, and
256MB of RAM.
To buy a gift certificate to send to someone, click the Gift Certificate link on
the Music Store home page. iTunes takes you to the Gift Certificate page in the
Music Store.
Click the Buy Now button to purchase a gift certificate. You can send a printed
certificate by snail mail or as an e-mail message. Supply the address, set the
amount of the gift certificate, and even add a personal message if you want;
then click Continue and follow the instructions to finish the process.
To set up or change the amount of a gift certificate, go to your account page
by clicking the Account button that shows your account name and typing
your password in the dialog that appears. Click the View Account button and
scroll the account page until you see the Gift Certificate button; click it to go
to the Gift Certificate page.

Authorizing computers to play 
purchased music
The computer that you use to set up your account is automatically autho-
rized by Apple to play the songs that you buy. Fortunately, the songs 
aren’t locked to that computer — you can copy them to other computers 
and play them with iTunes. When you first play the songs on the other 
computers, iTunes asks for your Music Store account ID and password to
authorize that computer. You can have up to five computers authorized at
any one time.
If you want to delete one computer and add another computer, you can remove
the authorization from a computer by choosing Advanced➪Deauthorize
Account on that computer.
After you set up an account, you can sign in to the Music Store at any time to
buy music, view or change the information in your account, and see your pur-
chase history. Each time you buy music, you get an e-mail from the iTunes
Music Store with the purchase information. It’s nice to know right away what
you bought.

Importing Music into iTunes
In This Chapter
 Setting importing preferences
 Ripping music from CDs
 Importing music files from other sources
T
o immortalize your music, you need to import it into iTunes from your
audio CDs and other sources. After the music is in your iTunes library,
you can preserve it forever. A song in digital format can be kept in that format
in a file on any number of digital media storage devices — so even if your
CDs, DVDs, and hard drive fail, your backup copy (assuming that you made 
a backup copy on a safety CD or disk) is still as perfect as the original digital
file. You can make any number of digital copies, and there are no technical
limitations on playing the copies except those imposed by the iTunes Music
Store for songs that you purchased.
Importing tracks from a CD is called ripping a CD. We’re not sure why it’s called
that, but Apple certainly took the term to a new level with an ad campaign for
Macs a while back that featured the slogan Rip, Mix, Burn. Burning a mix CD
was the hip thing to do a few years ago. With iTunes, you can still rip and mix,
but if you have an iPod, you no longer need to burn CDs to play your music
wherever you go.
Ripping, in technical terms, is the process of extracting the song’s digital infor-
mation from an audio CD, but in common terms it also includes the process
of compressing the song’s digital information and encoding it in a particular
sound file format. The ripping process is straightforward, but the import set-
tings that you choose affect sound quality, hard drive space (and iPod space),
and compatibility with other types of players and computers. In this chapter,
we show you how to rip CDs, import music from the Internet, and provide
suggestions for settings.

Setting the Importing Preferences
Although importing music from an audio CD takes a lot less time than playing
the CD, it still takes time, so you want your import settings to be correct before
starting. Pay a visit to the Importing Preferences window (iTunes➪Preferences
on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences in Windows), and then click the Importing
button. The Importing preferences appear, as shown in Figure 5-1.
The Import Using pop-up menu gives you the opportunity to set the type of
encoding — this is perhaps the most important choice — and the Setting
pop-up menu offers different settings depending on your choice of encoder.
Encoding is a complicated subject and requires a whole chapter of its own.
(In fact, Chapter 19 provides a more in-depth look if you want to know more.)
For a quick and pain-free ripping session, select from among the following
encoders in the Import Using pop-up menu based on how you plan to use
your iTunes library:
 AAC Encoder: We recommend the AAC for all uses. (However, AIFF is
better if you plan to burn another CD with the songs and not use them in
your iPod.) Select the High Quality option from the Setting pop-up menu.
You can convert a song that’s been ripped in AIFF or WAV to AAC or MP3,
as we describe in Chapter 20. However, ripping a CD with one encoder
might be more convenient — and after that, you can rip it again with a
different encoder. For example, you might import Sgt. Pepper with the
Figure 5-1:
Set your
importing
preferences
for ripping
CDs.
72
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

AAC encoder for use in your Mac and iPod, and then import it again 
with the AIFF encoder, calling the album “Sgt. Pepper-2” or something, 
in order to burn some songs on a CD. After burning the CD, you can
delete “Sgt. Pepper-2” to reclaim the hard drive space.
 AIFF Encoder: Use AIFF if you plan on burning the song to an audio CD.
AIFF offers the highest possible quality, but AIFF also takes up lots of
space. If you use AIFF, select the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up
menu. Don’t use AIFF format for songs to be transferred to your iPod —
convert them first to AAC or MP3, as we describe in Chapter 20.
 Apple Lossless Encoder: Use the Apple Lossless encoder for songs that
you intend to burn onto audio CDs and for playing on iPods — the files
are just small enough (about 60-70 percent of the size of the AIFF versions)
that they don’t hiccup on playback. 
 MP3 Encoder: Use the MP3 format for songs that you intend to burn 
on MP3 CDs or use with MP3 players or your iPod — it’s universally 
supported. If you use MP3, select the Higher Quality option from the
Setting pop-up menu.
 WAV Encoder: WAV is the high-quality sound format that’s used on PCs
(like AIFF), and it also takes up a lot of space. Use WAV if you plan on
burning the song to an audio CD or using it with PCs. If you use WAV,
select the Automatic option from the Setting pop-up menu. Don’t use
WAV for songs to be transferred to your iPod — convert them first to
AAC or MP3, as we describe in Chapter 20.
The Importing Preferences window offers the following options, which you
set before ripping a CD:
 Import Using: Set this pop-up menu to the encoder. For more information
about encoders, see Chapter 19.
 Setting: Set this pop-up menu to High Quality for most music. You can
change this setting to get better quality or use hard drive space more
efficiently, as we describe in Chapter 20.
 Play Songs While Importing: Select this check box to play the songs at
the same time that you start ripping them. This option slows down the
speed of importing, but hey — you get to listen to the music right away.
 Create File Names with Track Number: Select this check box to include
the track number in the file names created by iTunes for the songs that
you rip.
 Use error correction when reading Audio CDs: While it reduces the
speed of importing, select this check box to use error correction if you
have problems with audio quality or if the CD skips (not every skipping
CD can be imported even with error correction, but it may help).

Chapter 5: Importing Music into iTunes

Ripping Music from CDs
After checking your Importing Preferences to be sure that your settings are
correct, you are ready to rip. To rip a CD, follow these steps:
1. Insert an audio CD.
The songs appear in your song list as generic unnamed tracks at first. If
your computer is connected to the Internet, iTunes retrieves the track
information. If you connect first by modem, go ahead and establish your
connection, and then choose Advanced➪Get CD Track Names.
2. (Optional) Deselect the check boxes next to any songs on the CD that
you don’t want to import.
iTunes imports the songs that have check marks next to them; when you
remove the check mark next to a song, iTunes skips that song.
3. (Optional) To remove the gap of silence between songs that segue
together, select those songs and choose Advanced➪Join CD Tracks.
This happens often with music CDs — the tracks are separate, but the
end of one song merges into the beginning of the next song. You don’t
want an annoying half-second gap between the songs. For example, in
Figure 5-2, we joined the first two songs of the Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts
Club Band album because they run together. We also joined the last three
songs of the CD for the same reason.
Figure 5-2:
Join songs

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

To select multiple songs, click the first one, hold down Ô/Ctrl, and click
each subsequent one. To select several consecutive songs in a row, click
the first one, hold down Shift, and then click the last one.
Be sure to check the importing preferences before actually ripping the CD.
4. Click the Import button.
The Import button is at the top-right corner of the iTunes window. The
status display shows the progress of the operation. To cancel, click the
small x next to the progress bar in the status display.
iTunes plays the songs as it imports them. You can click the Pause button to
stop playback (but the importing continues). If you don’t want to listen to the
songs as they import, choose Preferences from the iTunes menu on a Mac or
from the Edit menu in Windows. In the Preference window, click the Importing
button. In the Importing Preferences window, deselect the Play Songs While
Importing check box.
iTunes displays an orange, animated waveform icon next to the song that it’s
importing. As iTunes finishes importing each song, it displays a check mark
next to the song, as shown in Figure 5-3. (On a color monitor, you see that the
check mark is green.) iTunes chimes when it finishes the import list. When all
the songs are imported, eject the CD by clicking the Eject button at lower-right
corner of the iTunes window. You can also choose Controls➪Eject Disc to eject
the disc, or click the Eject icon next to the disc’s name in the Source pane.

Chapter 5: Importing Music into iTunes

Importing Music Files
The quality of the music that you hear depends on the quality of the source.
Web sites and services offering music files vary widely. Some sites provide
high-quality, legally derived songs that you can download, and some provide
only streaming audio, which you can play but not save on your hard drive or
on a CD (such as a Web radio station). The allegedly illegal file-sharing ser-
vices offering MP3 files can vary in quality. Anyone can create MP3 files, so
beware of less-than-high-quality knockoffs.
You can download the music file or copy it from another computer to your
hard drive. After you save or copy an MP3 file — or for that matter an AIFF or
WAV file — on your hard drive, you can simply drag it into the iTunes window
to import it to your library. If you drag a folder or disk icon, all the audio files
that it contains are added to your iTunes library. You can also choose File➪
Add to Library as an alternative to dragging.
If you have your preferences set for iTunes to organize your library (the
default setting) and you add a song to your iTunes library, a copy is placed
inside the iTunes Music folder, which you can view in the Finder on a Mac 
or with Windows Explorer on a Windows PC. On the Mac, the iTunes Music
folder lives in the iTunes folder inside the Music folder in your Home folder.
The path to this folder is your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes
Music. On a Windows PC, the iTunes Music folder resides in the iTunes 
folder inside the My Music folder of the My Documents folder in your user
folder. The path to this folder is your user folder/My Documents/
My Music/iTunes/iTunes Music. These are the default locations — 
unless you turn off the default organization in iTunes by choosing iTunes➪
Preferences on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, clicking
Advanced in the Preferences dialog and unchecking the Keep iTunes Music
Folder Organized option.
When you import a song file into iTunes, the song is copied into a new file in
the iTunes library without changing or deleting the original file. You can then
convert the imported song to another format — for example, you can convert
an AIFF file to an MP3 file — while leaving the original intact. Find out about
converting your songs to a different format in Chapter 20.
MP3 CDs are easy to import — since they are essentially data CDs, simply
insert them into your CD-ROM drive, open the CD in the Finder, and drag-
and-drop the MP3 song files into the iTunes window. Downloaded song 
files are even easier — just drag-and-drop the files into iTunes. If you drag 
a folder or CD icon, all the audio files it contains are added to your iTunes
library.
76
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

You can import any sound into iTunes, even music from scratchy old vinyl
records or sound effects recorded through a microphone. The Pet Sounds
Sessions box set by the Beach Boys included just about every spoken word
and sneeze in the studio during the recording, and you might have equally
unusual sounds or rare music that can’t be found anywhere else.
How do you get stuff like that into iTunes? On a Mac, you can use GarageBand,
which is free (as part of iLife), or use a sound-editing program such as CD Spin
Doctor (part of the Toast package) or Sound Studio. These programs typically
record from any analog source device, such as a tape player or even a turn-
table. Sound Studio lets you record and digitize directly to your hard drive on
a Mac running OS X. Some Mac models include a free copy of Sound Studio
(you can find it in the Applications folder). You can also download a copy
from Felt Tip Software (www.felttip.com/products/soundstudio) and
use it for two weeks before having to pay $49.99 for it. Toast 6 Titanium from
Roxio (www.roxio.com) for Mac OS X includes the CD Spin Doctor applica-
tion for recording sounds.
There are many commercial applications to choose from that work on
Windows PCs, including Roxio’s Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum package, which
includes CD Spin Doctor. You can also use MusicMatch Jukebox to record
sound through a PC’s line-in connection.
AIFF- or WAV-encoded sound files occupy too much space in your music
library and iPod. Voice recordings and sound effects tend to be low-fidelity
and typically don’t sound any better in AIFF or WAV format than they do in
formats that save hard drive space. Also, sound effects and voice recordings
are typically mono rather than stereo. You can save hard drive and iPod
space and still have quality recordings by converting these files to MP3 or
AAC formats, changing them from stereo to mono in the process and leaving
the original versions intact. We describe converting songs in Chapter 20.
Importing Audio Books
Do you like to listen to audio books and spoken magazine and newspaper
articles? Not only can you bring these sounds into iTunes, but you can also
transfer them to an iPod and take them on the road, which is much more 
convenient than taking cassettes or CDs.
Audible is a leading provider of downloadable spoken audio files. Audible lets
you authorize computers to play the audio files, just like the iTunes Music
Store (see Chapter 4). Audible does require that you purchase the files, and
its content is also licensed by Apple to be included in the iTunes Music Store
in the Audio Books category. Audible content includes magazines and radio
programs as well as books.
77
Chapter 5: Importing Music into iTunes

To import Audible files, follow these steps:
1. Go to www.audible.com and set up an account if you don’t already
have one.
2. Select and download an Audible audio file.
Files that end with .aa are Audible files.
3. Drag the Audible file to the iTunes window.
If this is the first time that you’ve added an Audible file, iTunes asks for
your account information. You need to enter this information once for
each computer that you use with your Audible account.
To disable an Audible account, open iTunes on the computer that you no
longer want to use with the account, and choose Advanced➪Deauthorize
Computer. In the Deauthorize Computer dialog that appears, select the
Deauthorize Computer for Audible Account option and click OK.
You need to be online to authorize a computer or to remove the authorization
from that computer.

Sharing Music (Legally)
In This Chapter
 Sharing music purchased from the iTunes Music Store

 Copying music files and folders to other drives
 Copying music files from Macs to PCs and vice versa
H
ey, it’s your music after you buy it — that is, to the extent that you can
make copies for yourself. You want to play your music anywhere and
even share the music with your friends. It’s only natural.
You can easily share the music that you rip from your CDs: After the music
becomes digital, you can copy it endlessly with no loss in quality. You can also
share the songs that you download from a service. Of course, if the songs are
in a protected format (such as music bought from the iTunes Music Store), the
computers that access the shared library must be authorized to play the music.
However, iTunes lets you share a library over a local area network (LAN) with
other computers running iTunes. You can even share your music library over
a wireless network by using AirTunes and AirPort Express.
In this chapter, we show you how to bend the rules and share music with
others. (After all, your parents taught you to share, didn’t they?)
Sharing Music from the 
iTunes Music Store
To a limited extent, you can share the music that you buy online from the
iTunes Music Store. Apple uses a protected form of the AAC encoder for the
songs. (Read all about encoders in Chapter 19.) Thus, the rights of artists are
protected while also giving you more leeway in how to use the music more
than most other services (although by the time you read this, other services
might have adopted this format with similar privileges).

80
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 
I fought the law and the law won: 
Sharing and piracy
Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave personal demon-
strations of the iTunes Music Store and the iPod
to Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger. According
to Steven Levy at Newsweek(May 12, 2003), Jobs
said, “They both totally get it.” The former Beatle
and the Stones’ frontman are no slouches — both
conduct music-business affairs personally and
both have extensive back catalogs of music. They
know all about the free music-swapping services
on the Internet, but they agree with Jobs that
most people are willing to pay for high-quality
music rather than download free copies of ques-
tionable quality.
We agree with the idea, also promoted by Jobs,
that treating technology as the culprit with
regard to violations of copyright law is wrong.
Conversely, the solution to piracy is not tech-
nology because determined pirates always cir-
cumvent it with newer technology, and only
consumers are inconvenienced.
We’re not lawyers, but we think that the law
already covers the type of piracy that involves
counterfeiting CDs. The fact that you are not
allowed to copy a commercial CD and sell the
copy to someone else makes sense. You also can’t
sell the individual songs off a commercial CD.
Giving music away is, of course, the subject of
much controversy, with services such as the orig-
inal Napster closed by court order while others
flourish in countries that don’t have copyright
laws as strict as the United States. (Napster is
back, but it no longer provides the same type of
music sharing.) While earlier versions of iTunes
allowed the sharing of music across IP addresses
outside a local network, that feature was removed
at the request of record labels. The current ver-
sion of iTunes doesn’t enable the sharing of music
at this level — you have to hack it somehow —
so we don’t need to go into it, except to provide
one observation: The songs that we hear from free
sharing services such as KaZaa are (for the most
part) low quality, on a par with FM radio broad-
casts. They’re nice for listening to new songs to
see whether we like them, but they’re not useful
for acquiring as part of our real music collec-
tion. The iTunes Music Store is clearly superior
in quality and convenience, and we prefer the
original, authorized version of the song — not
some knock-off that might have been copied
from a radio broadcast.
As for making copies for personal use, the law is
murky at best. It depends on what you mean by
personal use.The iLife package allows you to use
these music files in creative projects. You can, for
example, put together a music video to show your
friends by using iMovie to combine some video
footage that you shot with your camcorder along
with the latest hit by Eminem. However, don’t
expect to see it on MTV or VH1. Your local public
access cable TV station can’t even play it unless
you first obtain the broadcast rights (which typ-
ically includes contacting the music publisher,
the record label, and the artist — good luck).
Can you legally use a pop song as a soundtrack
for a high school yearbook slideshow? It sounds
legal to us, given the ability to use music for edu-
cational purposes, but that is a question only a
lawyer can answer. If you’re interested in obtain-
ing the rights to music to use in semi-public or
public presentations, or even movies and docu-
mentaries for public distribution, you can contact
the music publisher or a licensing agent. Music-
publishing organizations, such as the Music
Publishers’ Association (www.mpa.org), offer
information and lists of music publishers, as well
as explanations of various rights and licenses.

The protected form of AAC used with iTunes Music Store songs lets you do
the following:
 Create backups. You can copy the music files and make as many copies
as you want.
 Copy music. Play songs on up to five separate computers. See Chapter 4
to find out how to authorize your computers.
 Share music over a network. Those running iTunes on a LAN can play
the music in your shared library, even over a wireless network using
AirPort Extreme, Apple’s wireless networking technology.
Regardless of whether you manage files on your hard drive on a regular basis,
you might want to know where these songs are stored so that you can copy
the music to other computers and to make a backup of the entire library. You
might also want to move the library to another computer — after all, these
computers just keep getting better year after year.
You can play your purchased music on any authorized computer, you can
authorize up to five at once, and you can remove authorization from any
computer that you don’t use.
Sharing Music in a Network
If you live like the Jetsons — with a computer in every room, connected by a
wireless or wired network — iTunes is made for you. You can share the music
in your library with other computers in the same network. These computers
can be PCs running Windows or Macs, as long as they are all running iTunes.
If they can communicate with each other over the network, iTunes can share
a music library with them.
When you share songs on a network, the song is streamed from the computer
that contains the songs in its library (the library computer) to your computer
over the network. The song is not copied to your music library. From your
computer, you can’t burn the shared-library songs onto a CD or copy the
songs to your iPod.
You can share radio links, MP3, AIFF, and WAV files, and even AAC files and
music purchased from the iTunes Music store, but not Audible spoken word
files or QuickTime sound files.
81
Chapter 6: Sharing Music (Legally)

To share your music library — turning your computer into the library 
computer — follow these steps:
1. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or from the Edit
menu on a Windows PC), and click the Sharing tab.
The Sharing window appears, as shown in Figure 6-1, offering options for
sharing music.
2. Select the Share My Music option.
3. Select either the Share Entire Library option or the Share Selected
Playlists option (and then choose the playlists to share).
4. Type a name for the shared library and add a password if you want.
The name that you choose appears in the Source list for other computers
that share it. The password restricts access to those who know it. Use a
password that you don’t mind letting others know — not the password
for the online music store or any other secret password.
Pick a password that you don’t mind sharing with others; for example,
your name is a good password, but your ATM PIN is not.
iTunes displays a Reminder: Sharing music is for personal use
only message.
5. Click OK.

You can access the music from the other computers on the network by fol-
lowing these steps:
1. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or from the Edit
menu on a Windows PC), and click the Sharing tab.
The Sharing window appears, offering options for sharing music (refer to
Figure 6-1).
2. Select the Look for Shared Music option.
The shared libraries or playlists appear in the Source pane, as shown in
Figure 6-2.
3. Click the shared library to select it.
Click the shared library in the Source pane (refer to Figure 6-2). iTunes
fills the view on the right with the artists and songs from the shared
library. Click the triangle next to a shared library entry in the Source
pane, as shown in Figure 6-3, to see the shared playlists.
When you are finished sharing a music library, click the tiny Eject button that
appears to the right of the shared library name in the Source pane.
Before turning off sharing for your library, you must first notify anyone sharing
the library to eject the shared library before turning off the sharing feature.
Otherwise, iTunes displays a warning dialog allowing you to either continue
(and break off the connection to the shared library) or to leave sharing turned
on for the moment.

Chapter 6: Sharing Music (Legally)

Sharing a music library can be incredibly useful for playing music on laptops,
such as PowerBooks, that support the wireless AirPort network.
Copying Songs to Other Computers
You can copy songs freely from your iTunes window to other hard drives and
computers, or copy the song folders from the iTunes Music folder to other
hard drives and computers. On the Mac, you can use the Finder to copy song
files as well as dragging songs out of the iTunes window into folders or hard
drives. Windows PCs offer several methods, including using Windows Explorer
to copy files.
The files are organized in folders by artist name and by album within the
iTunes Music folder. Copying an entire album, or every song by a specific
artist, is easy — just drag the folder to a folder on another hard drive.
You can find out the location of any song by selecting the song in iTunes and
choosing File➪Get Info. Click the Summary tab in the Get Info dialog to see
the Summary pane.
On the Mac, the iTunes Music folder can be found here:
Your Home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
Figure 6-3:

84
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

On a Windows PC, the iTunes Music folder can be found here:
Your User folder/My Documents/My Music/iTunes/iTunes Music
Your playlists, including the library itself (which is in some ways a giant
playlist), are stored as eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files in the iTunes
folder along with your iTunes Music folder.
The easiest way to copy an album from a folder on a hard drive into your
iTunes library is to drag the album’s folder over the iTunes window and drop
it there. To copy individual songs, you can drag the song files over the iTunes
window and drop them. When you add a song to your iTunes library, a copy
is placed inside the iTunes Music folder.
Copying Songs between PCs and Macs
Song files are not small, and album folders filled with songs are quite large.
Copying a music library from a Mac to a PC, or vice versa, is not a simple task
because of the enormity of the file sizes.
Don’t even think about e-mail. If the file is over four, it won’t go through the
door. (Four megabytes, that is; and the door is the limitation of your Internet
Service Provider’s e-mail server.) And if you use a .Mac e-mail account, that
limitation is more like 3MB.
Attaching a file to an e-mail message is the most popular method of transfer-
ring a file to someone, but there is a limit as to what you can attach. Most
e-mail servers in the world won’t accept an attachment larger than 5MB;
some won’t accept larger than 3MB.
Well, heck, just about every jazz tune and Grateful Dead jam we listen to in
iTunes is larger than 3MB. A song compressed in the AAC or MP3 format is
typically between 2 and 10MB, so you might get by with one pop song attached
to an e-mail, but that’s it.
How do you transfer larger amounts of music? One way would be with an
external FireWire or a USB hard drive formatted for a PC — an iPod installed
for Windows would do nicely, and you can learn all about using an iPod as a
hard drive in Chapter 25. The Mac should recognize it when you plug it in,
even though the drive is formatted for Windows, and you can copy files
directly to the hard drive, and then take the hard drive over to your PC. You
need FireWire or USB to connect an external drive. (USB is much slower.)
85
Chapter 6: Sharing Music (Legally)

On a LAN you can share forever — if your computers communicate over a
local-area network, they can share files . . . even large ones. To copy large
song files or entire album folders between two Macs in a LAN, all you need to
do is allow personal file sharing on your Mac. This sounds like a liberal thing
to do, inviting all sorts of mischief and voyeurism, but you can control what
others can do. (The converse is true: If someone wants to make a file or folder
available to you over a LAN, all he has to do is enable personal file sharing.) 
Mac OS X makes it very easy to share files and folders with Windows comput-
ers. You can enable Windows file sharing on the Mac, or access the Windows
computer from a Mac. To access a Windows PC from a Mac, you need a valid
user ID and password for an account on the Windows computer. You can go
right to that account’s Home directory on the Windows computer, and use
your Mac to copy folders and files to and from the Windows computer. For
more information about file sharing on a Mac and specifically between Mac
and Windows computers on a network, see Mac OS X Panther All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Copying very large song files over the Internet is more complex, involving use
of the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Although it’s easy to download an MP3 song
file from a Web page or an FTP site with any browser (all you need is the Web
or FTP address — and a user ID and password if the site is protected), you
can’t send the file to a protected site with most browsers unless the site is set
up for this function. One easy way to share your files from a Mac is to use the
.Mac service to create a Web page that accommodates anyone with the right
password, even Windows-using folks, to visit and download files you put there.
For information about setting up a .Mac account, see iLife All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies by yours truly (Wiley).
To make it easy for others to copy files to and from a Mac at their convenience,
enable FTP access for the Mac. To do this, open System Preferences, click the
Sharing icon, and click the Services tab. Select the FTP Access option. A mes-
sage appears at the bottom of the Sharing window providing the address of
your FTP server on your Mac — something like ftp://192.168.1.246/.
Give this address to those with an account on your computer, and they can
access files and folders by using a Web browser, an FTP client such as Fetch,
or Mac OS X.
How about transferring song files to other FTP sites, such as a password-
protected site that requires use of an FTP client? Here are several options:
 Use an FTP client, such as Fetch. You can find Fetch at http://
fetchsoftworks.com for $25 as of this writing. You can use it for 
several weeks before paying for it.
 Use the FTP function inside another application, such as Macromedia
Dreamweaver.
86
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

 Use the free Terminal application supplied with Mac OS X, found in 
the Utilities folder inside your Applications folder, which offers FTP. 
For instructions, see Mac OS X Panther All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies, by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley).
Fetch provides an easy drag-and-drop interface for transferring any type of
file with FTP servers. After you establish a connection with the FTP server
by typing the appropriate information (the FTP server name, your ID, your
password, and the directory that you have access to), you can drag files to
and from the FTP server window via the Finder, or you can browse folders to
select files and then use the Get and Put Files buttons.
You can send an entire folder of files, such as an album of songs or an artist
folder with multiple albums, by stuffing the folder (or even a set of folders) into
a compressed file. StuffIt Deluxe from Aladdin Systems (www.stuffit.com)
can compress the folder into one Zip or StuffIt file. (Zip is a standard compres-
sion format for Windows-based PCs.) You can then transfer the Zip file to the
FTP server in one step. While the Zip or StuffIt file formats compress other
types of files, if your music files are already compressed as MP3 or AAC the
files won’t get any smaller. However, the format offers a compact way of send-
ing an entire folder of files.

f your PC is on the trailing edge rather than the leading edge, don’t worry —
you won’t miss out on the iPod revolution. True, if you don’t use Windows
2000 or Windows XP on your PC, you can’t use iTunes for Windows. However,
if you use Windows Me, you can use MusicMatch Jukebox, which is available
on the iPod CD-ROM.
Because iTunes requires Windows 2000 or XP, a 500 MHz Pentium-class proces-
sor or faster, and 256MB of RAM, your only choice if you don’t have that 
configuration (or a higher-performance configuration) is to use MusicMatch
Jukebox, which requires only a 300 MHz or faster PC with at least 96MB of
RAM running Windows Me, 2000, or XP (with at least 128MB of RAM).
You might want to use MusicMatch Jukebox for other reasons, such as its
compatibility with other audio formats and its own MusicMatch MX radio.
MusicMatch Jukebox offers high-quality MP3 encoders that produce excellent
sound files that don’t take up much hard drive or iPod space. Still, you must
choose because your iPod can synchronize with only one program — iTunes
or MusicMatch Jukebox. This chapter describes how to install and start using
MusicMatch Jukebox. (See Chapter 2 for details on how to install iTunes.)

What You Can Do with MusicMatch
Jukebox 
With MusicMatch Jukebox, just like with iTunes, your computer is a vast juke-
box limited only by your hard drive space. You can manage this library and
keep a backup copy to preserve the music in high-quality format. iTunes and
MusicMatch Jukebox are very similar in how they work. It’s quick and easy to
slip in a CD and rip (transfer and digitally encode) songs into your music library.
The ripping process is very fast, and track information (including artist name
and title) arrives automatically over the Internet.
Like iTunes, MusicMatch Jukebox gives you the power to organize songs into
playlists and burn any songs in your library to CD, in any order. Both programs
offer equalizers with preset settings for all kinds of music and listening envi-
ronments as well as the ability to customize and save your own settings with
each song. Songs that you rip from your CDs and import from Web sites and
MP3 repositories can be burned onto another CD, copied to other computers,
and transferred to your iPod freely.
You need the following to use MusicMatch Jukebox with the iPod:
 A PC with a 300 MHz or faster processor
 Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, or newer version of Windows

MusicMatch Jukebox, as shown in Figure 7-1, looks a bit different than other
Windows applications, and you can even customize the way it looks by assign-
ing skins that represent designs of the graphical user interface, as we describe
in Chapter 23.
MusicMatch Jukebox offers the following separate windows that you can drag
to any position:

You can open artists just like folders in Windows Explorer to see songs
organized by album.
 Playlist window: Drag songs or albums to this window to play them. 
You can also save playlists.
 Recorder window: Tracks on audio CDs appear here, ready to be ripped
into your library when you click the Record button.

Installing MusicMatch Jukebox
Before installing the iPod software for Windows, make sure that you are
logged in as a Windows Administrator user if you’re using Windows 2000 
or Windows XP. Quit all other applications before installing, and disable 
any virus protection software.
If you’ve installed an earlier version of MusicMatch Jukebox (especially if it’s
a demo version provided free with your computer), you must use Add/Remove
Programs to remove the earlier version before installing the version that came
with your iPod. To remove the earlier version, click Start in your Windows
taskbar, choose Settings➪Control Panels➪Add/Remove Programs, and select
MusicMatch Jukebox to remove the program (called uninstall in some versions
of Windows).
When installing the iPod for Windows, be sure that you have the serial number
from the sleeve of your iPod’s CD-ROM. When you install MusicMatch Jukebox,
you need to type in this serial number, which unlocks the Plus version of
MusicMatch Jukebox. The Plus version runs a bit faster and offers many more
features than the plain version, including the ability to save your playlists.

Chapter 7: Using MusicMatch Jukebox

If you get a message recommending that you update MusicMatch Jukebox
with a version that’s newer than the one on your iPod’s CD-ROM, don’t do it
unless you know what you are doing. Apple no longer provides support for
any version but the one shipped with the iPod, which is version 7.50. Newer
versions might not work with the iPod without performing some tricks with
plug-ins. You can visit the MusicMatch Web site (www.musicmatch.com) for
more information.
To install the proper software to make your iPod work with Windows and
MusicMatch Jukebox, follow these steps:
1. Insert the iPod for Windows CD-ROM into your Windows-based PC. 
Do not connect your iPod to your PC yet.
The appropriate version of MusicMatch Jukebox licensed by Apple 
(version 7.50 as of this writing) is available on the CD-ROM supplied 
with your iPod. The CD-ROM automatically starts running when you
insert it into a PC.
2. If the installer doesn’t open automatically, double-click the CD-ROM
icon in the My Computer window, and then double-click the Setup icon.
3. Click Install, following the instructions as they appear.
iPod for Windows software must be installed on the C: drive in order to
work, but you can choose a destination folder.
4. Connect your iPod.
The installation instructions tell you when it’s time to connect your iPod
to the PC. Go ahead and connect it to the PC, and follow the instructions
to continue installation until installation is finished. If the PC doesn’t rec-
ognize the iPod, see the troubleshooting instructions in Chapter 28.
After you first connect the iPod to a PC during the installation process, the
iPod should be properly configured to work with Windows. The iPod for
Windows software should automatically run MusicMatch Jukebox when it
detects the iPod. If the program doesn’t automatically run, you can launch 
it yourself by double-clicking the icon for MusicMatch Jukebox.
In MusicMatch Jukebox, your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus
window under the Attached Portable Devices folder, as shown in Figure 7-2.
If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send to Portable Device.
The iPod automatically synchronizes to the MusicMatch Jukebox library after
you connect it, but you probably don’t have anything in your music library yet.
Your next step in building up your MusicMatch Jukebox library is to import
music from CDs, buy music online, or import music from other sources. The
next time that you connect your iPod, the music will transfer automatically.

Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

Importing Music into MusicMatch
Jukebox
To get tunes into your iPod, you need to first import the music from your
audio CDs or other sources. The importing process is straightforward, but
the settings that you choose for importing affect sound quality, hard drive
space (and iPod space), and compatibility with other types of players and
computers.
Setting the recording format
Importing music from an audio CD takes less time than playing the CD.
However, before you actually rip a CD, you should check your importing set-
tings. To check your importing (Recorder) settings in MusicMatch Jukebox,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Settings, and click the Recorder tab.
The Recorder pane of the Settings window appears, as shown in
Figure7-3.
From the Recording Format drop-down list, you can change the encoder
used to create the digital sound files.
2. Choose an encoding format and then make changes to its settings,
which vary depending on the encoding format that you choose.
You have to do this only once; MusicMatch Jukebox keeps these settings
for recording from audio CD until you change them.

Chapter 7: Using MusicMatch Jukebox

Use the MP3 recording format for songs that you intend to send to others over
the Internet, or burn an MP3 CD for use with MP3 CD players, or copy to an
iPod or other portable MP3 players. Select the quality option that you want:
 Choose CD Quality (128 kbps), or choose Custom Quality and move the
slider up to 320 kbps (refer to Figure 7-3) for the highest bit rate pro-
vided for the MP3 format (higher bit rates mean higher quality audio).
MusicMatch Jukebox also offers a version of CD Quality that offers
Variable Bit Rate (VBR), which is described in detail in Chapter 19.
 Use Near CD Quality for songs that you want to compress more and
don’t mind the loss in audio quality. 
 Use FM Radio Quality for voice recordings, narration, and very low qual-
ity audio but very high compression. 
For more information about the MP3 format, see Chapter 19.
WAV, the high-quality recording format used on PCs, is more suitable for digital
song files that you burn onto an audio CD. However, songs encoded in WAV
occupy approximately 10MB per minute, which is many times more space than
MP3. As a result, WAV files also require more iPod battery power to play and
Figure 7-3:
Set your

(Recorder)
settings

CDs in
MusicMatch

94
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

may skip when playing in an iPod because the skip protection cache fills up
too quickly when playing uncompressed music. We recommend that you use
WAV only to rip songs you intend to burn onto an audio CD or use with sound
editing programs.
You can import songs from a CD using one encoding format, and then import
them again by using a different format (or simply convert the songs, as we
describe in Chapter 20). For example, you might use WAV to encode songs that
you intend to burn onto a CD, and then use MP3 to encode the same songs
for use on an iPod. After burning the CD, you could delete the WAV versions,
which take up a lot of space.
Ripping songs from a CD
To rip a CD with MusicMatch Jukebox on a Windows PC, follow these steps:
1. Choose View➪Recorder to open the Recorder window, as shown in
Figure 7-4.
2. Insert an audio CD.
The songs first appear in your song list as generic unnamed tracks. If your
computer accesses the Internet at all times, MusicMatch Jukebox can con-
nect to the Internet automatically and retrieve the track information every
time you insert an audio CD. This takes only a few seconds. If for some
reason this didn’t happen and you are connected, or you have to connect
first by modem, go ahead and establish your connection, making sure that
CD Lookup is enabled. (To check, choose Options➪Settings and click 
the CD Lookup/Connectivity tab.) Then click the Refresh button along the
top of the Recorder window.

Chapter 7: Using MusicMatch Jukebox

3. (Optional) Remove the check mark next to any songs on the CD that
you don’t want to record (import).
MusicMatch Jukebox records the songs that have check marks next to
them; when you remove the check mark next to a song, the program
skips that song.
4. Click the red Record button in the Recorder window or next to the
playback controls to start importing the music.
5. MusicMatch Jukebox rips the CD.
When it’s done, the program automatically ejects the CD.
During recording, the status area shows the progress of the operation. To
cancel, click the Cancel button in the Recorder window.
Adding song files from other sources
After you save or copy an MP3 or WAV file to your hard drive from another
sound-editing program or from the Internet, click the Add (+) button in the
MusicMatch Jukebox Library window. You can then browse your hard drive
to find folders of music files and either add music files separately or add
entire folders of files at once.
You can also use MusicMatch Jukebox to automatically search your hard
drive for music to add to your library. Choose Options➪Music Library➪
Search and Add Tracks From All Drives. You can use this function to import
music from a network server as well as from your own hard drives.
Playing Songs in MusicMatch Jukebox
To play songs in MusicMatch Jukebox, click the song title, and click the 
Play button in the circle of playback controls in the upper-left corner of 
the MusicMatch Jukebox window, below the menu bar. This control panel
offers the usual play, pause, forward, and reverse buttons, as well as a
volume slider.
You can also click an artist name to select all the songs by the artist, and then
click the Play button. As you select them and click the Play button, the songs
appear in the order that you selected them in a list in the Playlist window, as
shown in Figure 7-5. You can also drag songs or albums to the Playlist window
in any order you choose; then click Play.
96
Part I: Setting Up and Acquiring Music 

To select a range of songs, click the first song and then hold down the Shift
key while clicking the last song. To add single songs to your selection, hold
down the Control/Ctrl key while clicking each.
Saving a playlist
If you installed the Plus version of MusicMatch Jukebox (by typing your iPod
CD serial number during installation), you can use the Save Playlist feature.
To save the songs in the Playlist window with a name for each playlist (essen-
tial for transferring playlists to the iPod, as we show in Chapter 11), click the
Save button, and give the playlist a name.
After saving a playlist, click the Clear button to clear the Playlist window so
that you can load a new set of songs to create another playlist.
To open a saved playlist, click the Open (+) button in the Playlist window and
click the Playlists icon in the left column of the Open Music window. You can
then select any named playlist, and MusicMatch Jukebox loads the playlist
into the Playlist window for playback.
You can leave the option Clear Current Playlist When Adding New Tracks
enabled so that you replace the current tracks in the Playlist window with 
the new playlist. If you want to add to the end of the current playlist, clear
this option.

Chapter 7: Using MusicMatch Jukebox

Playing albums
Although filling the Playlist window with all the songs by a particular artist is
easy, you might instead want to play entire albums of songs without having to
select each album or song.
To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular order, follow these steps:
1. Select one or more albums in the Library window.
2. Drag the album or albums into the Playlist window, and then click Play.
3. (Optional) Save your playlist by clicking the Save button, and then
type a name for your new playlist (such as the album name).
4. (Optional) After hearing the album, click the Clear button to clear the
playlist for the next album you choose.

Searching, Browsing, and 
Sorting in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Browsing your music library
 Changing viewing options 
 Sorting the song list
 Searching for songs or artists
You rip a few CDs, buy some songs from the iTunes Music Store, and then
watch your music library fill up with songs. That song list keeps getting
longer and longer — and as a result, your library is harder to navigate.
The iTunes library is awesome even by everyday jukebox standards — it can
hold up to 32,000 songs (depending on how much space you have on your hard
drive). And its companion, the 40GB iPod, can hold about 10,000 songs in the
AAC format — enough music to last at least three weeks if played 24 hours a
day! Even if you keep your iTunes library down to the size of what you can fit
on your iPod, you still have a formidable collection at your fingertips. If you’re
a music lover and your music collection is getting large, you’ll want to orga-
nize your collection to make finding songs easier. After all, finding U2’s “I Still
Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” is a challenge in a library of 32,000 songs.
This chapter shows you how to search, browse, and sort your music library
in iTunes. You can find any song in seconds and display songs sorted by artist,
album, genre of music, or other attributes. You can change the viewing options
to make your library’s display more useful.
Browsing by Artist and Album
You can switch from Song List view to Browse view to find songs more easily.
Browse view is useful as long as you track information for the songs. You aren’t
overwhelmed by a long list of songs — for example, when you select an album,
iTunes displays only the songs for that album.

To view albums in Browse view, click the Browse button in the upper-right
corner. iTunes organizes your music library by genre, artist, and album, which
makes finding just the right tunes easier, as shown in Figure 8-1. Click the
Browse button again to return to the Song List view — the Browse button 
toggles between Browse view and the Song List view.
The Browse view sorts the songs by genre, artist, and album. This type of
column arrangement is familiar to anyone who uses the Mac OS X Finder.
Click a genre in the Genre column to see artists in that genre, or click All at
the top of the Genre column to see all artists.
When you click an artist in the Artist column in the middle column (as shown
in Figure 8-2), the album titles appear in the Album column on the right. At the
top of the Album column, the All selection is highlighted, and the songs from
every album by that artist appear in the song list below the Genre, Artist and
Album columns.
To see more than one album from an artist at a time, hold down the Ô key on
a Mac (Ctrl on a Windows PC), and click each album name.
As you click different albums in the Album column, the song list displays the
songs from that album. The songs are listed in proper track order, just as the
artist, producer, or record label intended them.
This is great for selecting songs from albums, but what if you want to look 
at all the songs by all the artists in the library at once? You can see all the
songs in the library in Browse view by selecting All at the top of each of the
columns — Genre, Artist, and Album.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

Note that iTunes considers “Clash” and “The Clash” to be different groups —
we edit the artist name and other information whenever necessary, as we
describe in Chapter 9.
Understanding the Song Indicators
As you make choices in iTunes, it displays an action indicator next to each
song to show you what it’s doing. Here’s a list of indicators and what they
mean:
 Orange waveform: iTunes is importing the song.
 Green check mark: iTunes has finished importing the song.
 Exclamation point: iTunes can’t find the song. You might have moved or
deleted the song accidentally. You can move the song back to iTunes by
dragging it from the Finder to the iTunes window.
 Broadcast icon: The song is on the Internet and plays as a music stream.
 Black check mark: The songs are marked for the next operation, such as
importing from an audio CD or playing in sequence. Click to remove the
check mark.
 Speaker: The song is playing.
 Chasing arrows: iTunes is copying the song from another location or
downloading the song from the Internet.

Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Changing Viewing Options
iTunes gives you the ability to customize the song list. The list starts out with
the Song Name, Time, Artist, Album, Genre, My Rating, Play Count, and Last
Played categories. You might have to drag the horizontal scroll bar along the
bottom of the song list to see all these columns. You can display more or less
information, or different information, in your song list. You can also display
columns in a different order from left to right.
To make a column wider or narrower, drag the dividing line between the
column and the next column to its right. As you move your cursor over the
divider, it changes to a double-ended arrow; you can click and drag the divider
to change the column’s width.
You can also change the order of columns from left to right by clicking a
column heading and dragging the entire column to the left or right — except
that you can’t change the position of the Song Name column and the narrow
column to its left (which displays indicators). In addition, you can Control-click
(Ctrl-click) any of the column headings to display a shortcut menu offering the
same options as the View Options window, the Auto Size Column option, and
the Auto Size All Columns option.
Maybe you don’t like certain columns, like when they take up too much valu-
able screen space, or perhaps you want to display some other information
about the song. You can add or remove columns such as Size (for file size),
Date and Year (for the date the album was released, or any other date you
choose for each song), Bit Rate, Sample Rate, Track Number, and Comment.
To add or delete columns, choose Edit➪View Options.
The View Options dialog appears, as shown in Figure 8-3, and you can select the
columns that you want to appear in the song list. To pick a column, mark the
check box next to the column’s heading, indicating that column will be shown.
Any unchecked column headings are columns that do not appear in the song
list in iTunes. Note: The Song Name column always appears in the iTunes
song list and can’t be removed, which is why it doesn’t appear in the View
Options dialog. You can also change the view options by Ô-clicking on a Mac
(Ctrl-clicking on a PC) any of the column headings in the song list in either
Browse or Song List view.
The viewing options that you choose depend on your music playing habits.
You might want to display the Time column to know at a glance the duration
of any song. Or maybe you want the Date or Year columns to differentiate
songs from different eras, or the Genre column to differentiate songs from 
different musical genres.
104
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Browse view includes a Genre column on the left side. If you don’t need a
Genre column, you can remove it from the Browse view (or add it back) by
choosing Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or the Edit menu in
Windows). Click the General button at the top of the Preferences window. In
the General dialog, disable the Show Genre When Browsing option, which is
on by default.
Sorting Songs by Viewing Options
Knowing how to set viewing options is a good idea because you can use the
viewing options to sort the listing of songs. Whether you’re in Browse view 
or viewing the song list in its entirety, the column headings double as sorting
options.
For example, clicking the Time heading reorders the songs by their duration
in ascending order from shortest to longest. If you click the Time header again,
the sort is reversed, starting with the longest song. You can sort by any column
heading, such as Artist, Album, Track, and Ratings. You might want to add the
Date Added column to the Song List or Browse view, so that you can sort your
library by the date you added the song.
You can tell which way the sort is sorting — ascending or descending 
order — by the little arrow indicator in the heading. When the arrow points
up, the sort is in ascending order; when pointing down, it’s in descending
order.
Figure 8-3:
The viewing
options for
the song list.
105
Chapter 8: Searching, Browsing, and Sorting in iTunes

Alternatively, you can sort the song list in alphabetical order. Click the Artist
heading to sort all the songs in the list by the artist name, in alphabetical
order (arrow pointing up). Click it again to sort the list in reverse alphabeti-
cal order (arrow pointing down).
Searching for Songs
As your music library grows, you might find locating a particular song by the
usual browsing and scrolling methods that we describe earlier in this chapter
too time-consuming. So . . . let iTunes find your songs for you!
If you want to search the entire library in Browse view, first click the All selec-
tions at the top of the Genre and Artist columns to browse the entire library
before typing a term in the Search field. Or, if you prefer, click the Browse
button again to return to the Song List view, which lists the entire library.
Locate the Search field — the oval field in the top-right corner, to the left of
the Browse button — and follow these steps:
1. Click in the Search field, and then type several characters of your
search term, using these tips for best searching:
• You can search for a song title, an artist, or an album title.
• Typing very few characters results in a long list of possible songs,
but the search narrows down as you type more characters.
• The Search features ignore case — for example, when we search
for miles, iTunes finds “Eight Miles High,” “She Smiles Like a River,”
and everything by Miles Davis.
2. The results display as you type.
The search operation works immediately, as shown in Figure 8-4, dis-
playing in the song list any matches in the Song Name, Artist, and Album
columns.
If you’re in Browse view with an artist and a particular album selected,
you can’t search for another artist or song. Use browsing with searching
to further narrow your search.
3. Scroll through the search results and click a song to select it.
The search operation works immediately, searching for matches in the
Song Name, Artist, and Album columns of the listing.
106
Part II: Managing Your Music 

To back out of a search so that the full list appears again, you can either click
the circled X in the Search field (which appears only after you start typing
characters) or delete the characters in the Search field. You then see the entire
list of songs in the library’s song list, just as before you began your search. All
the songs are still there and remain there unless you explicitly remove them.
Searching only manipulates your view of the songs.

Information in iTunes
In This Chapter
 Retrieving information from the Internet
 Entering song information
 Editing information for a selected song
 Editing information for multiple songs at once
 Adding more information, album artwork, comments, and ratings
O
rganization depends on information. You expect your computer to do 
a lot more than just store your music with Untitled Disc and Track 1 as
the only identifiers.
Adding all the song information for your tracks seems like a lot of trouble, but
you can get most of the information automatically from the Internet — without
all that pesky typing. Adding song information is important because you don’t
want your ripped CD music to have vague song titles like Track 1. You certainly
don’t want to mistakenly play “My Guitar Wants to Kill Your Mama” by Frank
Zappa when trying to impress your classical music teacher with Tchaikovsky’s
3rd Movement, Pathétique Symphony, do you?
This chapter shows you how to add song information to your music library in
iTunes, and edit it for better viewing, so that you can organize your music by
artist, album name, genre, composer, and ratings, and then sort the Song List
or Browse view using this information by clicking on the column headings.

Retrieving Information from the Internet
Why bother entering song information if someone else has already done it for
you? You can easily get information about most music CDs from the Internet.
However, you do need to check your Internet connection first.
Retrieving information automatically
During the iTunes setup process that we describe in Chapter 2, you specify
whether iTunes connects automatically to the Internet. If you have an always-
on Internet connection, you probably set up iTunes to connect automatically;
if you use a modem to manually connect, you probably set up iTunes to not
connect automatically.
Even with a manual modem connection to the Internet, though, you can tem-
porarily change the setup of your Internet connection to connect automatically
at any time. Just follow these steps:
1. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or the Edit
menu on a Windows PC).
The Preferences dialog appears.
2. Click the General tab.
The General dialog appears.
3. Select the Connect to Internet When Needed option.
With this option enabled for a modem connection, iTunes triggers your
modem automatically (like a Web browser), calls your Internet service
provider (ISP), and completes the connection process before retrieving
the track information. With this option disabled (cleared), iTunes asks
first before connecting to the Internet.
You can always stop an automatic modem connection at any time — a good
idea if your ISP or phone service charges extra fees based on timed usage.
When iTunes finishes grabbing the song information from the Internet, switch
to your remote connection program without quitting iTunes, terminate the
Internet connection, and then switch back to iTunes. That way, you can leave
your Preferences setting to connect when needed and still terminate any con-
nection right after using it.
110
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Retrieving information manually
You can connect to the Internet at any time manually (such as with a
modem connection) and retrieve the song information when you are ready
to use it. After you connect to the Internet, choose Advanced➪Get CD Track
Names.
Even if you automatically connect to the Internet, the song information data-
base on the Internet (Gracenote CDDB) might be momentarily unavailable, 
or you might have a delayed response. If at first you don’t succeed, choose
Advanced➪Get CD Track Names again.
111
Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes
Long distance information: 
Using the Gracenote database
The first time we popped an audio CD into the
computer was like magic. iTunes, after thinking
for a few moments, displayed the song names,
album title, and artist names automatically. How
did it know? This information isn’t stored on a
standard music CD — iTunes has to either rec-
ognize the disc somehow or read the liner notes.
The magic is that the software knows how to
reach out and find the information on the
Internet — in the Gracenote CDDB service. (CDDB
stands for — you guessed it — CD Database.)
The site (www.gracenote.com) hosts CDDB
on the Web and offers the ability to search for
music CDs by artist, song title, and other meth-
ods. The iTunes software already knows how to
use this database, so you don’t have to!
Gracenote recognizes an audio CD by taking into
account the number of tracks and their dura-
tions (which is why the database can recognize
CD-Rs that are burned with the identical songs
in the same order). The database keeps track of
information for most of the music CDs that you
find on the market.
Although the database doesn’t contain any infor-
mation about personal or custom CDs, people can
submit information to the database about CDs that
the database doesn’t know. You can even do this
from within iTunes — type the information for
each track while the audio CD is in your computer,
and then choose Advanced➪Submit CD Track
Names. The information that you enter is sent to
the Gracenote CDDB site, where the good people
who work tirelessly on the database check out
your information before including it. In fact, if you
spot a typo or something erroneous in the infor-
mation that you receive from the Gracenote
CDDB, you can correct it, and then use the Submit
CD Track Names command to send the corrected
version back to the Gracenote site. The good
folks at Gracenote appreciate the effort.

After connecting and retrieving track information using a modem, your Internet
service might still be connected until the service hangs up on you. You might
want to switch to a browser, without quitting iTunes, and surf the Web to make
use of the connection — and use iTunes to play music while you surf.
Entering Song Information
You have to manually enter the song information for CDs that are not known
by the Gracenote CDDB or for custom CD-Rs. No big deal, though — just enter
a song’s information in either Browse view or song list view. Click directly in
the information field, such as Artist, and then click again so that the mouse
pointer turns into an editing cursor. You can then type text into the field.
After you enter the information for a rare CD, consider submitting the song
information to the Gracenote CDDB for others to use. Enter the information
for each track while the audio CD is in your computer, and then choose
Advanced➪Submit CD Track Names. The information that you type is sent 
to the Gracenote CDDB site, where it is checked first for accuracy and then

Editing the Information
Retrieving ready-made song information off the Internet is a great help, but
you might not always like the format it comes in. At some time or another, you
might want to edit artist and band names. For example, we like to list solo
artists by last name rather than by first name (as listings from the Gracenote
CDDB often are) — we routinely change Miles Davis to Davis, Miles.
Other annoyances sometimes occur in the CDDB, such as bands with The at
the beginning of their names, such as The Who, The Band, The Beatles, and
The Beach Boys. Even though these names sort correctly (in alphabetical
order under their proper name), we dislike having The before the band name,
so we routinely remove it.
In either Browse view or the Song List view, you can edit a song’s information
by clicking directly in the specific track’s field (such as the Artist field), and
clicking again so that the mouse pointer turns into an editing cursor. You can
then select the text and type over it, or use the Copy, Cut, and Paste commands
in the Edit menu, to move tiny bits of text around within the field. As you can
see in Figure 9-1, we changed the Artist field to be Beck, Jeff.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can edit the Song Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and My Ratings fields right
in the song list. However, editing this information with File➪Get Info is easier.
Keep reading to find out.
Editing multiple songs at once
Editing in the song list is fine if you’re editing the information for one song, but
typically you need to change all the tracks of an audio CD. For example, if a CD
of songs by Bob Dylan is listed with the artist as Bob Dylan, you might want to
change all the songs at once to Dylan, Bob. Changing all the song information
in one fell swoop is fast and clean, but like most powerful shortcuts, you need
to be careful because it can be dangerous.
You can change a group of songs in either Browse view or the song list view.
Follow these steps to change a group of songs at once:
1. Select a group of songs by clicking the first song and then holding
down the Shift key as you click the last song.
All the songs between the first and last are highlighted. You can extend a
selection by Shift-clicking other songs or add to a selection by Ô-clicking
on a Mac, or Ctrl-clicking on a Windows PC. You can also remove songs
already selected by Ô-clicking on a Mac or Ctrl-clicking on a PC.

Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes

2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (PC).
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to edit
information for multiple items?
On a highway, speed can kill. Speed-editing the information in multiple
songs at once can also be dangerous for your library organization. If, for
example, you change the song title, the entire selection then has that song
title. So be careful about what you edit when doing this. We recommend
leaving the Do Not Ask Me Again check box cleared so that the warning
appears whenever you try this.
3. Click Yes to edit information for multiple items.
The Multiple Song Information dialog appears, as shown in Figure 9-2.
4. Edit the field you want to change (typically the Artist field) for the
multiple songs.
When you edit a field, a check mark appears automatically in the check
box next to the field. iTunes assumes that you want that field changed 
in all the selected songs. Make sure that no other check box is selected
except the field that you want, which is typically the Artist field (and
perhaps the Genre field).
5. Click OK to make the change.
iTunes changes the field for the entire selection of songs.

Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can edit the song information before importing the audio tracks from a
CD. The edited track information for the CD imports with the music. What’s
interesting is that when you access the library without the audio CD, the edited
version of the track information is still there — iTunes remembers CD infor-
mation from the CDs you previously inserted. Even if you don’t import the 
CD tracks, iTunes remembers the edited song information until the next time
you insert that audio CD.
Editing fields for a song
Although the track information grabbed from the Internet is enough for identi-
fying songs in your iTunes library, some facts — such as composer credits —
are not included. Composer information is important for iPod users because
the iPod allows you to scroll music by composer as well as by artist, album,
and song. Adding composer credits is usually worth your while because you
can then search and sort by composer and create playlists.
After your songs import into the music library, locate a single song and choose
File➪Get Info (or press Ô-I). You see the song’s information dialog, as shown
in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-3:

115
Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes

When you select one song, the Song Information dialog appears; when you
select multiple songs, the Multiple Song Information dialog appears. Be careful
when selecting multiple songs and using the Get Info command.
The Song Information dialog offers the following tabs:
 Summary: The Summary tab (as shown in Figure 9-3) offers useful infor-
mation about the music file’s format and location on your hard drive; the
music file size; and information about the digital compression method
(bit rate, sample rate, and so on).
 Info: The Info tab allows you to change the song name, artist, composer,
album, genre, year, and other information, and you can also add com-
ments, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 Options: The Options tab offers volume adjustment, choice of equalizer
preset, ratings, and start and stop times for each song. You can assign
up to five stars to a song (your own rating system, equivalent to the 
Top 40 charts).
 Artwork: The Artwork tab allows you to add or delete artwork for the
song. The iTunes Music Store supplies artwork with most songs. Read
how to add artwork in the upcoming section, “Adding Album Cover Art
or Images.”

Part II: Managing Your Music 

You can edit the song information one song at a time and still move quickly
one song at a time through an album (without having to close the song infor-
mation dialog and reopen it) by clicking the Previous or Next buttons in the
bottom-left corner of the dialog to jump from song to song in an album.
Adding a rating
iTunes also allows you to rate songs, and the cool thing about ratings is that
they’re yours. You can use them to mean anything you want. For example, you
can rate songs based on how much you like them, whether your mother would
listen to them, or how they blend into a work environment. Then you can use
the My Top Rated playlist to automatically play the top-rated songs in the
library. You find out more about playlists in Chapter 10.
To add a rating to a song, click the Options tab, as shown in Figure 9-5. Drag
inside the My Rating field to add stars — the upper limit is five stars (for best).
You might have noticed the My Top Rated playlist in the Source pane. This
playlist is an example of a smart playlist — a playlist that updates itself when
ratings are changed. The My Top Rated playlist plays all the top-rated songs
in the library.

Chapter 9: Adding and Editing Song Information in iTunes

Adding Album Cover Art or Images
Songs that you buy from the iTunes Music Store typically include an image of
the album cover art or a photo of the artist. You can see the artwork in the
lower-left corner of the iTunes window by clicking the Show/Hide Artwork
button, as shown in Figure 9-6. The artwork changes for each song or album
that you select.
Unfortunately, you don’t get free artwork like this when you rip an audio CD —
the discs aren’t manufactured with digital cover art stashed somewhere on an
empty track. With a scanner, however, you can scan the cover art and save 
it in a graphics format that iTunes (and its underlying graphics technology,
QuickTime) understands — JPEG, GIF, PNG, TIFF, or Photoshop. Or with a Web
browser, you can visit Web pages to scout for suitable art; just Ctrl-click (Mac)
or right-click an image (PC) to download and save the image on your hard
drive. (Most graphics on the Web are in JPEG or GIF format, so you don’t have
to convert anything.)
To add the artwork to a song, select the song in your iTunes library, and drag
the artwork’s image file from a folder into the artwork viewing area in the
bottom-left corner of the iTunes window.

To add the same image as artwork for an entire album of songs (rather than
just individual songs), select the album in Browse view first (or select all the
songs in the album in song list view), and then drag the image file into the
artwork viewing area.
You can also add the artwork to an album while editing multiple songs at
once. Follow these steps:
1. In Browse view, select the album in your iTunes library.
Click the Browse button to switch to Browse view so that an Album column
appears on the right side of the iTunes window. Click an album to select it.
2. Choose File➪Get Info or press Ô-I (Mac) or Ctrl-I (PC).
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to edit
information for multiple items?
3. Click Yes to edit information for multiple items.
The Multiple Song Information dialog appears.
4. Enable the Artwork field by selecting its check box.
When you add a check mark to a field, iTunes assumes you want that
field changed in all the selected songs. Make sure that no other check
box is selected except Artwork.
5. Drag the graphics file to the Artwork panel.
Drag the graphics file directly over the blank Artwork well in the
Multiple Song Information dialog.
6. Click OK to make the change.
A warning message displays: Are you sure you want to change
the artwork for multiple items?
7. Click Yes to change the artwork.
iTunes adds the artwork for the entire album.
To remove the artwork from a song, view the artwork in a larger window, or
resize the artwork, choose File➪Get Info and click the Artwork tab. You can
add a different image, add several images, delete the images with the Add or
Delete buttons, or resize images with the size slider.
You can remove the artwork for an entire album by opening the Multiple Song
Information dialog (choose File➪Get Info after selecting the album), enabling
the Artwork field, and then clicking OK. Because you haven’t added anything
to the Artwork field, iTunes replaces the artwork with nothing, effectively
deleting the artwork.

Organizing Music with Playlists
In This Chapter
 Creating a playlist of multiple songs
 Creating a playlist of albums
 Creating and editing smart playlists
 Deleting songs, albums, artists, and playlists
T
o organize your music for different operations, such as copying to your iPod
or burning a CD, you make a playlist — a list of the songs that you want.
You can use playlists to organize your music playback experience. For exam-
ple, you can make a playlist of love songs from different albums to play the
next time you need a romantic mood or compile a playlist of surf songs for 
a trip to the beach. We create playlists specifically for use with an iPod on
road trips, and we generate other playlists that combine songs from different
albums based on themes or similarities.
You can create as many playlists of songs, in any order, as you like. The song
files themselves don’t change, nor are they copied — the music files stay right
where they are, with their names stored in the playlists. 
You can even create a smart playlist that automatically includes songs in the
playlist based on the criteria you set up and removes from the playlist songs
that don’t match the criteria. The song information you edited in Chapter 9 is
very useful for setting up the criteria — for example, you can define the crite-
ria for a smart playlist to automatically include songs from a particular artist,
or songs that have the highest rating or fit within a particular musical genre.

Creating Playlists
You can create playlists of individual songs or entire albums. Not only do you
save yourself a lot of browsing time by creating playlists, but you also need
to create a playlist if you want to burn a CD.
Playlists of songs
You can drag individual songs into a playlist and rearrange the songs quickly
and easily.
To create a playlist, follow these steps:
1. Click the + button or choose File➪New Playlist.
The + button, in the bottom-left corner of the iTunes window under the
Source pane, creates a new playlist in the Source pane named untitled
playlist.
2. Type a descriptive name for the playlist.
The playlist appears in the Source pane. After you type a new name,
iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabetical order in the Source pane,
underneath the preset smart playlists and other sources.
3. Select the library in the Source pane, and then drag songs from the
library to the playlist.
Drag one song at a time (as shown in Figure 10-1) or drag a selection of
songs, dropping them onto the playlist name in the Source pane. The ini-
tial order of songs in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag
them to the list. Of course, you can rearrange the songs in any order after
dragging them, as we show in the next step.
4. Select the playlist in the Source pane, and then drag songs to
rearrange the list.
To move a song up the list and scroll at the same time, drag it over the up
arrow in the first column (the song number); to move a song down the list
and scroll, drag it to the bottom of the list. You can move a group of songs
at once by selecting them first (holding down Shift to select a range of
songs, or press Ô on a Mac or Ctrl on a PC to select specific songs), and
then dragging them into a new position.
You can drag songs from one playlist to another playlist. Remember: Only
links are copied, not the actual files. Besides dragging songs, you can also
rearrange a playlist by sorting the list — click the Song Name, Time, Artist
column headings, and so on. And when you double-click a playlist, it opens 
in its own window, displaying the song list.
122
Part II: Managing Your Music 

To create a playlist quickly, select the group of songs that you want to make
into a playlist, and then choose File➪New Playlist from Selection. A new playlist
appears in the Source pane, and you can then type a name for the playlist.
Playlists of albums
You might want to play entire albums of songs without having to select each
album as you play them. For example, you might want to use an iPod on that
long drive from London to Liverpool to play Beatles albums in the order they
were released (or perhaps the reverse order, reversing the Beatles’ career from
London back to Liverpool).
To create a playlist of entire albums in a particular order, follow these steps:
1. Create a new playlist.
Create a playlist by clicking the + sign under the Source pane or by choos-
ing File➪New Playlist. Type a descriptive name for the new playlist.
2. Select the library in the Source pane, and click the Browse button to
find the artist.
The Album list appears in the right panel.
3. Drag the album name over the playlist name.
4. Select and drag each subsequent album over the playlist name.
Each time you drag an album, iTunes automatically lists the songs in the
proper track sequence.
Figure 10-1:
Dragging 
a song to
add it to a
playlist.
123
Chapter 10: Organizing Music with Playlists

You can rename a playlist at any time by clicking its name and typing a new
one, just like you would rename any filename in the Mac Finder or Windows
Explorer.
Using Smart Playlists
At the top of the Source pane, indicated by a gear icon, you can find what Apple
(and everyone else) calls a smart playlist. iTunes comes with a few sample
smart playlists, such as the My Top Rated playlist, and you can create your
own. Smart playlists add songs to themselves based on prearranged criteria.
For example, as you rate your songs, My Top Rated changes to reflect your
new ratings. You don’t have to set anything up — My Top Rated is already
defined for you.
Of course, smart playlists are ignorant of your taste in music — you have 
to program them with criteria using the song information you edited in
Chapter 9. For example, you can create a smart playlist that uses the Year
field to grab all the songs from 1966, only to find that the list includes the
Beatles (“Eleanor Rigby”), Frank Sinatra (“Strangers in the Night”), the
Yardbirds (“Over Under Sideways Down”), and Ike and Tina Turner (“River
Deep, Mountain High”) in no particular order. Use other fields of the song
information you entered, such as ratings, artist name, or comment to fine-
tune your criteria. You can also use built-in functions such as the Play Count
(the number of times the song was played) or the Date Added (the date the
song was added to the library).
Creating a smart playlist
To create a new smart playlist, choose File➪New Smart Playlist. The Smart
Playlist dialog appears (as shown in Figure 10-2), offering the following choices
for setting criteria:
 Match the Following Conditions: From the first pop-up menu (refer to
Figure 10-2), you can select any of the categories used for song informa-
tion. From the second pop-up menu, you can choose an operator, such
as the greater than or less than operators. The selections that you make
in these two pop-up menus combine to express a condition such as Year
is greater than 1966. You can also add multiple conditions by click-
ing the + button, and then decide whether to match all or any of these
conditions.
124
Part II: Managing Your Music 

 Limit To: You can limit the smart playlist to a specific duration, measured
by the number of songs, time, or size in megabytes or gigabytes, as shown
in Figure 10-3. The songs can be selected by various methods such as
random, most recently played, and so on.
 Match Only Checked Songs: This option selects only those songs that
have a check mark beside them, along with the rest of the criteria.
Checking and unchecking songs is an easy way to fine-tune your selec-
tion for a smart playlist.
 Live Updating: This allows iTunes to automatically update the playlist
continually as you play songs, add or remove them from the library,
change their ratings, and so on.
After setting up the criteria, click OK. iTunes creates the playlist with a gear
icon and the name untitled playlist. You can click in the playlist field and type
a new name for it.

Chapter 10: Organizing Music with Playlists

Editing a smart playlist
To edit a smart playlist, select the playlist and choose File➪Edit Smart Playlist.
The Smart Playlist window appears, with the criteria for the smart playlist.
To modify the smart playlist so that songs with a higher rating are picked,
simply add another star or two to the My Rating criteria.
You can also choose to limit the playlist to a certain number of songs, selected
by various methods such as random, most recently played, and so on.
Deleting Songs, Albums, 
Artists, and Playlists
Deleting songs can seem counterproductive when you’re trying to build up
your iTunes library, but there are times when you have to do it, such as the
following:
 Deleting versions of songs: You might have ripped a CD twice — once in
AIFF format to burn the songs onto another CD, and another in AAC format
for your library and iPod. You can delete the AIFF versions in your library
after burning your CD (as we describe in Chapter 14).
 Deleting songs from playlists: You can delete songs from playlists while
keeping the songs in your library. When you delete a song from a playlist,
the song is simply deleted from the list — not from the library. You have

A smart playlist for recent additions
Setting up multiple criteria gives you the oppor-
tunity to create playlists that are way smarter
than the ones supplied with iTunes. For example,
we created a smart playlist with criteria shown
in Figure 10-3 that does the following:
 Adds any song added to the library in the past
week that alsohas a rating greater than three
stars.
 Limits the playlist to 72 minutes of music (to
fit on one audio CD), and refines the selection
to the most recently added if the entire selec-
tion becomes greater than 72 minutes.
 Matches only checked songs.
 Performs live updating.

to switch to the Library in the Source pane in order to delete songs from
the library. You can delete playlists as well, without harming the songs
in those playlists.
 Deleting a song, album, or artist you don’t like: You can select any
song, group of songs, album, group of albums, artist, or group of artists,
and then press Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Clear. After clicking
Yes to the warning message, the songs are gone from iTunes. (Why did
you rip them in the first place? See Chapter 3 about how to play tracks
first, before importing them.)
To delete a song from a playlist, select the playlist in the Source pane, and then
select the song. Press Delete/Backspace (that’s Delete on a Mac or Backspace
on a Windows PC), or choose Edit➪Clear. In the warning dialog that appears,
click Yes to remove the selected item from the list.
To delete a playlist, select the playlist in the Source pane and press Delete/
Backspace, or choose Edit➪Clear.
To delete a song from the library, select Library in the Source pane, and then
select the song. Press Delete/Backspace, or choose Edit➪Clear. In the warn-
ing dialog that appears, click Yes to remove the selected item from the list.
Deleting a song removes the song from your iTunes library, but it doesn’t
remove it from your hard drive until you agree. iTunes displays another 
warning — Some of the selected files are located in your 
iTunes Music folder. Would you like to move these files to 
the Trash? — and you can click Yes to trash them, No to keep them in 
your music folder, or Cancel to cancel the operation.
You can delete multiple songs by first selecting them. Just hold down Shift 
as you click to select a range of songs, or hold down Ô (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) as
you click each song to add it to the selection. Then press Delete/Backspace,
or choose Edit➪Clear.
To delete an entire album, first select the album in Browse view, press
Delete/Backspace, or choose Edit➪Clear. To delete everything by an artist,
first select the artist in Browse view, and then press Delete/Backspace or
choose Edit➪Clear. If you choose to move the album or artist folder to the
Trash, the album or artist folder is deleted from your hard drive; otherwise, 
it remains in your iTunes Music folder.
If you leave music files and folders in your iTunes Music folder, you can add
them back to your iTunes library by dragging and dropping them into the
iTunes window.

i
Tunes puts music on your iPod (actually more than just music — you can
include audio books or anything stored as a song in iTunes), and iTunes
can fill your iPod very quickly with the tunes in your library.
If you’re too busy to copy specific songs to your iPod and your entire 
iTunes music library fits on your iPod anyway, why not just copy every-
thing? Copying your library is just as fast as copying individual songs, if not
faster, and you don’t have to do anything except connect the iPod to your
computer. This chapter shows you how to set up iTunes to automatically
update your iPod.
This chapter also shows how you can update your iPod manually, choosing
which songs to copy. iTunes is flexible in that you can use either option or
both options to update your iPod. For example, you can update automatically
with all the songs in playlists, go into iTunes, copy other music not in playlists
directly to your iPod, and delete songs from your iPod if you need to make
room. This chapter explains how to set your preferences for updating and
change them when you need to.

If you use MusicMatch Jukebox on a Windows PC rather than iTunes, see
Chapter 12 about updating your iPod.
Changing Your Update Preferences
If you’ve changed your iPod preferences to update manually, you can change
them back to update automatically any time and vice versa. Change your iPod
preferences by following these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
Your iPod must be connected for you to change the update preferences.
iTunes starts automatically. If this is the first time connecting your 
iPod, it synchronizes automatically with the iTunes library. If you 
want to prevent this from happening, hold down the Ô and Option 
keys on the Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) as you connect the iPod,
keeping them pressed until the iPod name appears in the iTunes 
Source pane.
2. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
Your iPod appears in the Source pane using the name you gave it when
you installed the iPod software (see Chapter 2).
3. Click the iPod Options button on the bottom-right side of the iTunes
window.
The iPod Preferences dialog appears, as shown in Figure 11-1.

4. Select the update preferences you want.
Set the update preferences, and click OK to the warning message that
appears. For example, if you select the Automatically Update All Songs
and Playlists option, iTunes displays a warning message asking you to
confirm the update preference you chose (see Figure 11-2).
5. Click OK to go ahead (confirming that you want to change to automatic
update).
6. Change other iPod preferences as you wish.
Other preferences that you might want to change include Open iTunes
When Attached, which launches iTunes automatically when turned on. 
If this is off, you have to start iTunes by clicking its icon in the Dock, or
by double-clicking the application in the Applications folder.
7. Click OK to close iPod Preferences.
8. Click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-right side of
the iTunes window.
Another way to eject the iPod on a Mac is to drag the iPod icon on the
Desktop to the Trash — or in Mac OS X 10.3, click the eject icon next to
the iPod icon in the Finder Sidebar. In Windows, you can use various
methods, including right-clicking the iPod icon and choosing Eject.
After you eject the iPod, the iPod displays an OK to disconnect mes-
sage in first- and second-generation models, or the iPod main menu in
third-generation models. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock,
or disconnect the dock from the computer.
While the updating is in progress, don’t disconnect your iPod from the com-
puter until it tells you it is safe to do so. The iPod is a hard drive, after all, and
hard drives need to be closed down properly in order for you not to lose any
critical data. When it’s safe, the iPod displays an OK to disconnect message in
first- and second-generation models, or the iPod main menu in third-generation
models.

Chapter 11: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

Updating Your iPod Automatically
The default setting for a new iPod is to update itself automatically, synchroniz-
ing to your iTunes library: The iPod matches your library exactly, song for
song, playlist for playlist. If you made changes in iTunes after the last time
you synchronized, those changes are automatically made in the iPod when
you synchronize again. If you added or deleted songs in your library, those
songs are added or deleted in the iPod library.
If your iTunes music library is too large to fit on your iPod, you can still update
automatically and keep your iPod synchronized to a subset of your library,
adding new material under your control. For example, you can let iTunes
select the music automatically according to your ratings, as described in 
the upcoming section, “Updating from a library larger than your iPod.” You
can even create a smart playlist that does it for you, as described in the later
section, “Updating by playlist.”
Before you actually connect your iPod to a computer to automatically update
the iPod, keep these things in mind:
 iTunes remembers your updating preferences from the last time you
updated your iPod. If you already set your preferences to update auto-
matically, iTunes remembers and starts to automatically update your
iPod. If you already set your preferences to update manually, iTunes
remembers and makes your iPod active in the iTunes Source pane.
 To prevent your iPod from automatically updating, hold down the Ô and
Option keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) as you connect the iPod,
and keep pressing until the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane.
This works even if you choose to automatically update the iPod in the
Setup Assistant.
 If you connect your iPod to another computer running iTunes, you 
might be in for a surprise. When you connect an iPod previously linked
to another computer, iTunes displays the message: This iPod is
linked to another iTunes music library. Do you want to
change the link to this iTunes music library and replace
all existing songs and playlists on this iPod with those
from this library? If you don’t want to change your iPod to have this
other music library, click No. Otherwise, iTunes erases your iPod and
updates your iPod with the other computer’s iTunes library. By clicking
No, you change that computer’s iTunes preferences to manually update,
thereby avoiding automatic updating.
 Songs stored remotely (such as songs shared from other iTunes libraries
on a network) are not synchronized because they are not physically on
your computer. See Chapter 6 for more info on how to share music over
a network with iTunes.
132
Part II: Managing Your Music 

When your iPod is set to update automatically (the entire library, or by either
playlist or selected song), the iPod song list and the iPod entry in the Source
pane are grayed out in the iTunes window. Because you manage the contents
automatically, you don’t have direct access to the songs in the iPod using
iTunes. For direct access, see “Updating Your iPod Manually,” later in this
chapter.
Synchronizing with your library
Your iPod is set up by default to automatically update itself from your iTunes
library so that it can synchronize with it. Just follow these simple steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
When you first connect the iPod to the computer, your iPod automati-
cally synchronizes with your iTunes music library — unless you turned
off the Automatic Update option in the Setup Assistant, or unless you
hold down the Ô and Option keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC)
while connecting the iPod.
2. Wait for the updating to finish and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane (up at the top) reads iPod update is
complete. You can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in
the bottom-right side of the iTunes window.
You can also eject the iPod by dragging the iPod icon on the Desktop to |the
Trash on the Mac; in OS X 10.3, you can click the eject icon next to the iPod
icon in the Finder Sidebar. In Windows, you can use various methods, includ-
ing right-clicking the iPod icon and choosing Eject from the contextual menu.
While the updating is in progress and right after ejecting the iPod, don’t dis-
connect your iPod from your computer until it tells you that it’s safe to do so.
As a reminder, the iPod displays the message Do not disconnect.
Updating from a library 
larger than your iPod
If your iTunes music library is too large to fit on your iPod, you can still
update automatically and keep your iPod synchronized to a subset of your
library. When you first use your iPod (which is set by default to automatic
update), iTunes displays a message if your library is too large to fit, telling
you that it has created a special playlist for your iPod.
133
Chapter 11: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

The message gives you only once choice, which is to click OK. iTunes creates
a new playlist specially designed for updating your iPod automatically. For
example, if your iPod is named GigaMojo, you will find a new playlist named
GigaMojo Selection filled with all the songs that iTunes could fit in your iPod.
If, on the other hand, you have already been using your iPod and it’s set to
automatically update, iTunes displays a message that gives you a choice of
automatically creating a new playlist, or letting iTunes choose for you: 
 If you click Yes, iTunes creates a new playlist (titled GigaMojo Selection,
if your iPod is named GigaMojo like ours) and displays a message telling
you so. Click OK, and iTunes updates your iPod using the new playlist.
 If you click No, iTunes updates automatically until it fills up your iPod.
iTunes decides which songs and albums to include in this playlist using
the ratings that you can set for each song in the iTunes song information,
as we describe in Chapter 9. iTunes groups album tracks together and
computes an average rating and play count for the album. It then fills the
iPod, giving higher priority to albums with play counts and ratings greater
than zero. You can therefore influence the decisions that iTunes makes
by adding ratings to songs or entire albums.
Updating by playlist
Updating by playlist is useful when you want to copy selected sets of songs to
your iPod every time you connect it to your computer. For example, you can
define a set of playlists in your iTunes library to use just for updating an iPod
that doesn’t have enough capacity to hold your entire library. To do this, set
up the iPod to update only selected playlists automatically.
Updating automatically by playlist is also an easy way to automatically update
an iPod from an iTunes library that is larger than the iPod’s capacity.
Before using this update option, create the playlists in iTunes (see Chapter 10)
that you want to copy to the iPod. Then follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
If your iPod is set to automatically update, hold down the Ô and Option
keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) while connecting the iPod.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences dialog appears.
134
Part II: Managing Your Music 

4. Select the Automatically Update Selected Playlists Only option.
5. In the list box, select each playlist that you want to copy in the update.
Select the check box next to each playlist to select it for the update, as
shown in Figure 11-3.
6. Click OK.
iTunes automatically updates the iPod by erasing its contents and copy-
ing only the playlists that you selected in Step 5.
7. Wait for the updating to finish, and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete.
Then you can click the iPod Eject button (the one with the eject triangle),
which appears in the bottom-right side of the iTunes window.
Updating selected songs
You might want to update the iPod automatically but only with selected
songs — especially if your iTunes library is larger than the capacity of your
iPod. To use this method, you must first select the songs that you want to
transfer to the iPod in the iTunes library and then deselect the songs that
you don’t want to transfer.
To select a song, mark the check box next to the song. To deselect a song,
click the check box again so that the check mark disappears.
Figure 11-3:
Set the iPod
to automat-
ically update
with only
selected
playlists.
135
Chapter 11: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

You can quickly select or deselect an entire album by selecting an album in
Browse view and holding down the Ô key (Mac) or the Ctrl key (PC).
After you deselect the songs that you don’t want to transfer and make sure
that the songs you do want to transfer are selected, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
If your iPod is set to automatically update, hold down the Ô and Option
keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) while connecting the iPod.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
You can select the iPod name even when it’s grayed out.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences dialog appears (refer to Figure 11-1).
4. Select the Automatically Update All Songs and Playlists option and
click OK for the Are you sure you want to enable automatic
updating message that appears.
5. Select the Only Update Checked Songs check box and then click OK.
iTunes automatically updates the iPod by erasing its contents and copy-
ing only the songs in the iTunes library that are selected.
6. Wait for the updating to finish, and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete,
and you can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the
bottom-right side of the iTunes window.
Updating Your iPod Manually
With manual updating, you can add music to your iPod directly via iTunes,
and you can delete music from your iPod as well. The iPod name appears in
the iTunes Source pane, and you can double-click to open it, displaying the
iPod playlists.
You might have one or more reasons for updating manually, but some obvi-
ous ones are the following:
 Your entire music library is too big for your iPod, and you want to copy
individual albums, songs, or playlists to the iPod directly.
 You want to share a single music library with several iPods, and you
have different playlists that you want to copy to each iPod directly.
 You share an iPod with others, and you want to copy your music to the
iPod without wiping out their music.
136
Part II: Managing Your Music 

 You want to copy some music from another computer’s music library
without deleting any music from your iPod.
 You want to edit the playlists and song information directly on your iPod
without changing anything in your computer’s library.
 You want to play the songs on your iPod using iTunes on the computer,
where you can play your iPod through the computer’s speakers and take
advantage of iTunes playback features (such as cross-fading between two
tracks — see Chapter 18).
When you set your iPod to update manually, the entire contents of the iPod is
active and available in iTunes. You can copy music directly to your iPod, delete
songs on the iPod, and edit the iPod playlists directly.
To set your iPod to update manually, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer, holding down the Ô and Option
keys on a Mac (Ctrl and Alt keys on a PC) to prevent automatic updating.
Continue holding the keys down until the iPod name appears in the
iTunes Source pane.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences dialog appears (refer to Figure 11-1).
4. Select the Manually Manage Songs and Playlists option.
iTunes displays the Disabling automatic update requires manu-
ally unmounting the iPod before each disconnect message.
5. Click OK to accept the new iPod preferences.
The iPod contents now appear active in iTunes and not grayed out.
Don’t disconnect your iPod while it is active in iTunes with the manual updat-
ing method. You have to eject the iPod and wait until the iPod displays the
message OK to disconnect (in first- and second-generation models) or the
iPod main menu.
Copying music directly
As soon as you set your iPod to manual updating, you can copy music directly.
To copy music to your iPod directly, follow these steps (with your iPod con-
nected to your Mac):
1. Select the iTunes music library in the Source pane.
The library’s songs appear in a list view or in Browse view.
137
Chapter 11: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

2. Drag items directly from your iTunes music library over the iPod
name in the Source pane, as shown in Figure 11-4.
When you copy a playlist, all the songs associated with the playlist copy
along with the playlist itself. When you copy an album, all the songs in
the album are copied.
3. Wait for the copy operation to finish and then eject the iPod.
Wait until the iTunes status pane reads iPod update is complete;
you can then click the iPod Eject button, which appears in the bottom-
right side of the iTunes window.
Deleting music on your iPod
With manual updating, you can delete songs from the iPod directly. Manual
deletion is a nice feature if you just want to go in and delete a song or an
album to make room for more music.
Automatic synchronization with your iTunes library means that anything 
you delete in your iTunes library is also deleted when you update your iPod.
However, if you update manually, you can delete songs from your iPod with-
out changing your iTunes library.
Figure 11-4:
Copy an
album of
songs
directly from

138
Part II: Managing Your Music 

To delete any song in the song list with your iPod set to manual updating,
follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Open the iPod’s contents in iTunes.
3. Select a song or album on the iPod in iTunes, and press
Delete/Backspace or choose Edit➪Clear.
iTunes displays a warning to make sure you want to do this; click OK to
go ahead or Cancel to stop. If you want to delete a playlist, select the
playlist and press Delete or choose Edit➪Clear.
Like in the iTunes library, if you delete a playlist, the songs are not deleted —
they are still on your iPod unless you delete them from the iPod song list or
update the iPod automatically with other songs or playlists.
Managing Playlists on Your iPod
The song information and playlists for your iPod are automatically copied to
your iPod when you update the iPod. However, you might want to edit your
iPod’s music library separately, perhaps creating new playlists or changing
the song information manually, just on your iPod.
First you must connect your iPod to your computer, open iTunes, and set
your iPod to update manually, as we describe earlier in “Updating Your iPod
Manually.”
Creating playlists directly on the iPod
You can create a playlist just on the iPod itself, using songs that are on the
iPod. The songs must already be on the iPod.
To create a new playlist, follow these steps:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the triangle next to the iPod name to open the iPod list of
playlists, as shown in Figure 11-5.
3. Create a new playlist by clicking the + button in the bottom-left corner
of iTunes under the Source list or choose File➪New Playlist.
Untitled playlist appears in the Source pane under the iPod entry.
139
Chapter 11: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

4. Type a name for the untitled playlist.
After you type a new name, iTunes automatically sorts it into alphabeti-
cal order in the list under the iPod.
5. Click the name of the iPod in the Source pane and drag songs from
the iPod song list to the playlist.
You can also click the Browse button to find songs on the iPod more
easily.
The order of songs in the playlist is based on the order in which you drag them
to the list. You can rearrange the list by dragging songs within the playlist.
You can create smart playlists on the iPod in exactly the same way as in
the iTunes music library. A smart playlist updates itself when you create it
using iTunes, and then updates itself every time you connect and select
your iPod with iTunes. Read all about smart playlists in Chapter 10.
Editing playlists
To edit an existing playlist on your iPod, do the following:
1. Select the iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
2. Click the triangle next to the iPod name to open the iPod list of
playlists.
3. Scroll the Source pane to locate the playlist.
Figure 11-5:
Create a
playlist here.
140
Part II: Managing Your Music 

4. Select the playlist to rearrange songs.
5. Click the name of the iPod in the Source pane and drag more songs
from the iPod song list to the playlist.
You can also click the Browse button to find songs more easily.
The songs and albums that you drag to an iPod playlist must already 
be on the iPod. If you want to copy songs from your iTunes library, see
“Updating Your iPod Manually,” earlier in this chapter.
Editing Song Information on Your iPod
With the iPod selected in iTunes and set for updating manually, you can edit
song information just like you do in the iTunes library by scrolling down the
song list and selecting songs.
After selecting the iPod in the Source pane, click the Browse button. In Browse
view, you can browse the iPod library, and find the songs by artist and album.
You can edit information such as the Song Name, Artist, Album, Genre, and
My Ratings information for the iPod songs directly in the columns in the song
list. To edit song information, locate the song and click inside the text field of
a column to type new text.
You might find it easier to edit this information by choosing File➪Get Info and
typing the text into the Song Information dialog, as shown in Figure 11-6.
Figure 11-6:
Type the
composer
credits here.
141
Chapter 11: Updating Your iPod with iTunes

iTunes grabs song information from the Internet (as we describe in Chapter 9),
but this information typically doesn’t include composer credits. If you have
the time and inclination to add composer credits, doing so is worth your while
because you can then search, sort, and create playlists based on this informa-
tion. This is particularly important for classical music lovers because iTunes
and the iPod make it easy to find songs by the performer/artist but not by the
composer — and sorting by composer is what many classical music fans prefer.

 Deleting songs and repairing broken links in MusicMatch Jukebox
W
ith MusicMatch Jukebox, just like with iTunes, your computer is a
vast jukebox limited only by your hard drive space. Like iTunes,
MusicMatch Jukebox gives you the power to organize songs into playlists 
and update your iPod.
This chapter shows how to manage your MusicMatch Jukebox library and take
advantage of its special organization features, such as super-tagging songs with
song information, updating your iPod manually, and updating by saved playlist.
This chapter also shows you how to set up MusicMatch Jukebox to automati-
cally update your iPod and synchronize the iPod’s library to the MusicMatch
Jukebox library.
Managing Song Information
Organization depends on information. Your computer can do a lot more than
store your songs with Untitled Disc and Track 1 as the only identifiers. Song
names, album titles, genre definitions, and composer credits might seem triv-
ial, but you can use this information to browse songs on your iPod.

Using CD Lookup
You can get information about most music CDs from the Internet. However, you
need to check your Internet connection first, keeping the following in mind:
 If you use an always-on broadband Internet service (for example, DSL or
cable modem), you probably want MusicMatch Jukebox to connect and
retrieve song information automatically.
 If you’re using a dial-up modem, if your Internet service is intermittently
off, or if your Internet service provider (ISP) charges prohibit using it all
the time, you probably don’t want this connection to be automatic.
In MusicMatch Jukebox, you can enable CD Lookup to grab song information
from the Internet. Just choose Options➪Settings and click the CD Lookup/
Connectivity tab. Then select the Enable CD Lookup Service option.
You can set an optional timeout limit, in seconds, for how long MusicMatch
Jukebox should spend trying to access the database before giving up. (Internet
databases can be offline for a number of reasons, or your Internet connection
might not be working.)
MusicMatch Jukebox lets you defer CD Lookup for another time, when your
Internet connection is active. By default, MusicMatch Jukebox is set to enable
deferred service, assuming that most users are intermittently connected to the
Internet. This is set by default so that you can record CDs to your music library
and have MusicMatch Jukebox look up the information later, when your com-
puter is connected to the Internet. You can change this by disabling the Enable
Deferred CD Lookup Service option.
When you record audio CDs, MusicMatch Jukebox connects to the Internet
and retrieves the song information automatically, or defers this action until
your computer is connected (unless you turned off these options). MusicMatch
Jukebox refers to song information as tags, and you can always edit your tag
information manually.
Editing information tags
The song information on the Internet might not be exactly the format you want
it. For example, solo artists are listed by first and last names, as in John Lennon,
but you might want to list them surname first, as in Lennon, John. You might
also want to remove The from band names such as The Who, instead listing
the band under Who.
144
Part II: Managing Your Music 

The song information retrieved using the CD Lookup service can be changed
after you record a CD into your MusicMatch Jukebox music library. You can edit
the tag information for a single song or for an entire album of songs at once.
To edit the information for a single song, select the song and click the Tag
button (or right-click the song and choose Edit Track Tags) to open the Edit
Track Tag(s) window, as shown in Figure 12-1.
The Edit Track Tag(s) window opens with the General information (as shown
in Figure 12-1). You can change the information for each tab in the Edit Track
Tag(s) window — Lyrics, Notes, Bios, and More. The General tab shows infor-
mation that appears in the Player window when you play a song, and some of
this information is transferred to your iPod for sorting songs under the artist’s
name, the album name, and so on.
You can also edit the song information for multiple songs at once. To edit all
the songs from a particular album, follow these steps:
1. Select one of the songs, and click the Tag button (or right-click the song
and choose Edit Track Tag) to open the Edit Track Tag(s) window.
2. Click the Load Album button in the lower-left side of the Edit Track
Tag(s) window.
The Load Album button loads all the songs from the album into the list
on the left side of the window.
At this point, you can click each song in the album and change its informa-
tion. A quicker way is to click the Select All button to select all the songs in
the album and thus change information for all the songs at once (such as the
artist’s name), as shown in Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-1:
Edit the
song (tag)
info here.
145
Chapter 12: Managing the MusicMatch Jukebox Library

When you edit a tag for multiple songs, a check mark appears automatically
in the box next to the tag. The check mark indicates that the tag will be
changed when you click OK or Apply. Before clicking OK or Apply, make 
sure that no other box is checked except the tags you want to change. 
Then click OK, and MusicMatch Jukebox changes the tags for the entire
album of songs.
In the music library, MusicMatch Jukebox lists your songs under the artist
name. If you change the artist name for an album of songs, the location of the
music in your library changes because the names are sorted in alphabetical
order. However, the filenames do not change.
When you change the artist’s name for an album of songs, you might also
want to change the filenames stored on disk to reflect this change. See
“Super-tagging songs with information” in this chapter.
Adding information about songs
Adding more information about songs enables you to use the criteria of your
choice — such as genre of music or your personal ratings — to locate songs
in the MusicMatch Jukebox library and on your iPod.
After your songs are recorded into the music library, locate a single song and
click the Tag button (or right-click the song and choose Edit Track Tags). You
should see the Edit Track Tag(s) window, which provides a list of songs for
an album (if you click Load Album) and also shows the hard drive path to the
file for the selected songs. You can change the information by clicking each of
these tabs:
Figure 12-2:
You can edit
an artist’s
name for an
entire album
of songs.
146
Part II: Managing Your Music 

 General: This tab shows the track title, artist name, album title, genre,
and preference. It also offers album artwork retrieved from the song infor-
mation database on the Internet — or you can add your own artwork.
 Lyrics: This tab lets you add the lyrics to songs. You can copy the lyrics
from a text editor (such as Notepad or Microsoft Word) or a Web page
and paste them into the empty text box.
 Notes: This tab lets you add notes and comments. You can copy infor-
mation from a text editor and paste it into the empty text box.
 Bios: This tab lets you add musician credits or other information (such
as liner notes) to songs. You can copy this information from a text editor
and paste it into the empty text box.
 More: This tab lets you categorize your songs by tempo, mood, and 
situation, specify the year of release, and add URLs (Internet addresses)
for more information. You can also specify whether the song should be
prepared for volume leveling.
Although most of this added information is not transferred to the iPod (only
the information in the General tab is transferred), the information makes it
easier to find music in the library and prepare playlists for different occasions.
You can, for example, select all your up-tempo songs for a playlist and transfer
that playlist to your iPod for listening on an upbeat day.
Super-tagging songs with information
You can tag your music with information automatically by using the super-
tagging feature. After you transfer your songs into the music library, select 
a group of songs or an entire album, and right-click the selection to display
the contextual menu — or choose Edit➪Super Tag Playlist Track(s) with the
album or songs already selected. Then choose one of the following:
 Choose Super Tagging➪Lookup Tags to find and add information from the
Internet. Even if you have partial song information, super-tagging can fill
in the remaining tags. The Lookup Tags results window displays the tags
found for each track. Choose the tag set that best represents your tracks.
 Choose Super Tagging➪Tag from Filename to find and add information
based on the music track’s filename. For example, if the music file is U2 -
Beautiful Day.mp3, the tags created are U2 for the Artist field and
Beautiful Day for the Track Title field. 
 Choose Super Tagging➪Rename Files to change the filenames stored
on the hard drive to reflect a change in the artist’s name. (Music files are
stored by artist name.) MusicMatch Jukebox displays the current name
and new name for each song, and you can click OK if you want to make
the change. 
147
Chapter 12: Managing the MusicMatch Jukebox Library

Viewing Your Song Library
When you update your iPod automatically, all the songs in your library are
transferred to your iPod. However, if you want to update your iPod manually
with specific songs or albums, you need to be able to find these songs and
albums in the library quickly. With MusicMatch Jukebox, you can sort the list
of songs and locate songs or albums.
Browsing the library
When you first open MusicMatch Jukebox, the music library window displays
songs in a similar fashion as Windows Explorer, with songs appearing as files
within a folder that uses the artist’s name, as shown in Figure 12-3 (showing
the songs from the album All That You Can’t Leave Behind, by the band U2).
Clicking the plus sign next to an artist’s name opens that listing like a folder;
clicking the minus sign closes the folder.
To make a column wider or narrower in MusicMatch Jukebox, drag the divid-
ing line between the column and the next column.
Changing views of your library
MusicMatch Jukebox let you customize the music library’s display to show
more or less information, or different information, in the columns. You can
change your music library’s display of songs to view by album, artist, genre,
or even album art.
Figure 12-3:
Browse
albums 
and songs
by artist.
148
Part II: Managing Your Music 

To change the viewing of songs for browsing, click the folder icon in the View
By column, which displays a drop-down menu for choosing different ways to
view the songs.
When you select to view by album cover art, the album covers appear in the
music library, with pop-up text balloons appearing over each album as you
move your mouse over them.
Double-click a song in the list or double-click an album, and the song or
songs appear in the playlist window and start playing. You can clear the
playlist by clicking the Clear button under the playlist.
To change the columns in the song list, choose Options➪Settings➪Music
Library to display the Settings window. In the View By pop-up menu, you can
change the first column of the song listing, which typically is the column used
for sorting the list.
You can choose up to six more columns (for a total of seven) to display in the
song list. To pick the type of information for a column, select the check box
for the column and choose the type of information (tag) for that column. An
unchecked column header indicates a column that will not appear. 
You can also right-click any column heading in the MusicMatch Jukebox song
list to change the type of information that it shows.
The column headers also act as sorting options; click once to sort in ascending
order, and click again to sort in descending order. The arrow indicator in the
header indicates whether the sort is in ascending or descending order — when
the arrow points up, the sort is in ascending order; a down arrow indicates a
descending order.
Searching for songs
To search for a song in MusicMatch Jukebox, click the Find button in the music
library window to display the Find in Music Library dialog. Type part or all of
a song name’s characters and then click Find First (or OK).
MusicMatch Jukebox lists the first match for the characters in the Find window.
You can continue to find more matches by clicking Find Next. Clicking the Add
button adds the song to your current playlist.
149
Chapter 12: Managing the MusicMatch Jukebox Library

You can use the Match Complete Name Only and Match Case options to
refine your search. To match the complete name, you must type the entire
song name. To match case, you must type the name exactly as it appears in
the list, with uppercase and lowercase characters.
Updating Your iPod with 
MusicMatch Jukebox
You can set up your iPod to be updated with music in different ways depend-
ing on how much music you have in your library:
 Automatically (entire library): Update the iPod automatically to match
your music library on your computer, adding or deleting songs as 
necessary.
 Automatically by playlist: Update the iPod with only the playlists
you’ve selected, deleting everything else on your iPod.
 Automatically by preselected songs: Update your iPod with only the
songs marked by a check mark, deleting everything else on your iPod.
 Manually: Update your iPod by dragging songs, albums, and/or playlists
to the iPod, without deleting anything. You can also manually delete
songs, albums, and playlists from your iPod and edit playlists and song
information directly on the iPod with this method.
Updating automatically
Adding music to and deleting music from your iPod can be totally automatic.
By default, the iPod is set up to update itself automatically, synchronizing itself
with your music library.
With automatic update, your iPod matches your library exactly, song for song,
playlist for playlist. MusicMatch Jukebox automatically copies everything in
your music library to your iPod. If you made changes in your music library
after the last time you updated your iPod, those changes are automatically
made in your iPod when you connect it to the computer again. If you added
or deleted songs in your library, those songs are added or deleted in your
iPod’s library (unless you use the Ignore All Content Deletions option).
By default, MusicMatch Jukebox is set up to automatically update your iPod
unless you disabled the Complete Library Synchronization option in the
Options window. Connect your iPod to the PC; if MusicMatch Jukebox does
not launch by itself, start the program.
150
Part II: Managing Your Music 

Wait a few minutes for MusicMatch Jukebox to recognize your iPod, which
should appear in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached Portable
Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send to Portable
Device to open it. When your iPod appears, select it and click the Sync 
button to update your iPod with the MusicMatch Jukebox music library. The
PortablesPlus window displays a warning message — click Yes to continue.
When the synchronization is complete, click the Eject button at the bottom-
left side of the PortablesPlus window to eject the iPod.
During updating, the iPod displays the warning Do not disconnect. Wait 
for the update to finish and also for the iPod to display the iPod main menu
(or the message OK to disconnect in older iPods) before disconnecting it
from your computer.
If you changed your iPod options to update manually or automatically by
playlist, you can change it back to automatic update by following these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC, and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to
recognize your iPod.
Your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send
to Portable Device.
2. Select the iPod, click the Options button, click the Synchronization tab,
and then select the Complete Library Synchronization option, as shown
in Figure 12-4. 
You can also enable the options to Automatically Synchronize on Device
Connection and Ignore All Content Deletions.
Figure 12-4:

151
Chapter 12: Managing the MusicMatch Jukebox Library

3. Click OK to close the Options window.
4. Click the Sync button in the PortablesPlus window to update your
iPod with the MusicMatch Jukebox music library.
The PortablesPlus window displays a warning message — click Yes to
continue.
5. When the synchronization is complete, click the Eject button at the
bottom-left side of the PortablesPlus window to eject the iPod.
The Options window offers two options for automatic updating: You can set
your iPod to automatically synchronize on device connection so that each time
you connect the iPod, the synchronization starts immediately. Or, you can set
it to ignore all content deletions so that the update does not delete anything in
your iPod — it simply adds more music, leaving the music on your iPod intact.
If you select the option to Automatically Synchronize on Device Connection,
your iPod will update automatically when you connect it. However, if you
don’t want this to happen every time, go to the Options window to turn it off.
(If you just connected, you have to wait for an update to happen before you
can do this.) The alternative is to leave this option off and use the Sync button
when you want to update your iPod.
Updating by MusicMatch playlist
If you have several iPods or music devices, or several people sharing one
music library or one iPod, you might want to set up automatic updating by
playlist so that you can determine which playlists (and associated music files)
are copied to the iPod automatically. Before using this update option, create
the playlists that you want to copy to the iPod. (See Chapter 7 for details on
how to create and save playlists in MusicMatch Jukebox.)
MusicMatch Jukebox lets you save playlists and synchronize them with an
iPod automatic update. When you use this feature, you can make changes to
the defined playlists in the library, and the changes are automatically updated
to the iPod’s versions of the same playlists. You can create new playlists and
define them for synchronization, and the automatic update then copies the
new playlists and music to the iPod.
To define playlists for automatic update, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC, and wait for it to be recognized by
MusicMatch Jukebox. 
Your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send
to Portable Device.

2. Select the iPod, click the Options button, click the Synchronization
tab, and then select the Selected Playlist Synchronization option.
You can also enable the options to Automatically Synchronize on Device
Connection and Ignore All Content Deletions.
3. Add a check mark in the box next to each playlist to define playlists
for synchronization, and click OK to close the Options window.
4. Click the Sync button in the PortablesPlus window to update your
iPod with the defined playlists.
The PortablesPlus window displays a warning message — click Yes to
continue.
5. When the synchronization is complete, click the Eject button at the
bottom-left side of the PortablesPlus window to eject the iPod.
In the iPod, playlists appear directly under the iPod’s name on the left side 
of the PortablesPlus window. The contents of the iPod (or the contents of 
the selected playlist in the iPod) appear in the right side of the window.
Updating manually
You can copy music directly to your iPod without automatic updating and
synchronization. The iPod’s playlists appear directly under the iPod’s name
on the left side of the PortablesPlus window. The contents of the iPod (or the
contents of the selected playlist in the iPod) appear in the right side of the
window.
To copy music directly to your iPod, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC, and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to
recognize your iPod.
Your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send
to Portable Device.
2. Select the iPod so that its contents appear in the right side of the
window.
3. Drag entire albums or songs from the music library window to the
PortablesPlus window.
4. When the copying is complete, drag more albums or songs, or click
the Eject button at the bottom-left side of the PortablesPlus window 
to eject the iPod.

Chapter 12: Managing the MusicMatch Jukebox Library

Deleting Songs
Deleting songs or albums from the MusicMatch Jukebox library is easy. First
select the song or album in the library window. Right-click to show the contex-
tual menu and then choose Remove. The song files are not deleted — only the
links to the library are deleted. You must still use Windows Explorer to locate
and delete the song and album files. See “Searching for songs” earlier in this
chapter for details on how to find the song files in MusicMatch Jukebox.
If you update your iPod automatically, song deletion is also automatic on the
iPod. If you delete a song or album from your music library, the next time you
update the iPod, the song or album is deleted automatically (unless you dis-
able the Ignore All Content Selections option.
However, if you are manually updating your iPod, you also have to manually
delete songs that you no longer want on your iPod.
In MusicMatch Jukebox, you can delete songs directly on the iPod. The 
iPod’s playlists appear directly under the iPod’s name on the left side of 
the PortablesPlus window. The contents of the iPod (or the contents of the
selected playlist in the iPod) appear in the right side of the window.
To delete songs on the iPod, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC, and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to
recognize your iPod.
Your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus window under the Attached
Portable Devices folder. If the window is not yet open, choose File➪Send
to Portable Device.
2. Select the iPod so that its contents appear in the right side of the
window.
3. Select one or more songs, right-click to show the pop-up menu, and
then choose Remove.
4. When you’re finished deleting songs, click the Eject button at the
bottom-left side of the PortablesPlus window to eject the iPod.
Repairing Broken Links to Songs
MusicMatch Jukebox can play songs located anywhere on your hard drive,
but if changes occur to your hard drive’s folder structure or to folder names,
some of your songs might not be linked properly to MusicMatch Jukebox.
Fortunately, you can repair these links automatically.
154
Part II: Managing Your Music 

If you get the message <path\track . . . could not be found . . .
while trying to play a track from your library, you can repair the link by right-
clicking the track and choosing Repair Broken Links (or choosing Options➪
Music Library➪Repair Broken Links). MusicMatch Jukebox scans your library
for broken links and offers the following functions in a dialog:
 Fix It: This button browses your hard disk for the file to re-link it to the
library.
 Remove: This button removes the link from your library but does not
remove the music file from your computer.
 Remove All: This button removes all broken links. MusicMatch Jukebox
searches your entire library and removes any links to tracks that are no
longer active. However, it does not remove the music files from your
computer.
 Skip: This button skips the current missing link and moves on to the
next one.
 Abort: This button ends the repair process prematurely.
You should repair all broken links before synchronizing your iPod to your
MusicMatch Jukebox library so that you don’t miss any songs.

Gimme Shelter for My Music
In This Chapter
 Locating the iTunes music library 
 Exporting playlists from iTunes
 Consolidating and backing up your iTunes music library
 Backing up MusicMatch Jukebox music libraries
You might think that your music is safe, stored as it is on both your iPod
and your hard drive. However, demons in the night are working overtime
to render your hard drive useless, while at the same time someone left your
iPod out in the rain. (No, not really, but it could happen.)
Copyright law and common sense prohibit you from copying copyrighted
music and selling it to someone else. However, you are allowed to make copies
of music for your personal use, including copies for your iPod and copies for
backup.
In this chapter, you find out how to make a backup of your music library — a
very important operation, especially if you purchase songs that don’t exist any-
where else. That way, even if your hard drive fails, you still have your music.
You can’t copy music files from your iPod to your computer using iTunes.
While we describe third-party utility programs (not supported by Apple) in
Chapter 27 that can do the job, the reason you can’t copy music from your
iPod using iTunes is that record companies won’t allow indiscriminate copying.
Most music is copyrighted and shouldn’t be copied in this manner anyway
(according to record labels). Instead, keep a backup of your iTunes library 
on your computer and on another hard drive or backup medium — don’t 
rely on your iPod as a music storage device.

Some music that you can use in iTunes and with your iPod is protected. The
iTunes Music Store uses Apple’s FairPlay technology that protects the rights of
copyright holders while also giving you some leeway in how you can use the
music. You can copy the music files freely, so backup is easy and straightfor-
ward on either a PC or a Mac. The question of whether you can play the music
after copying it is answered by reading the section on authorizing computers
to play purchased music in Chapter 4. (Hint: You can play iTunes Music Store
songs on up to five computers at the same time.)
Finding the iTunes Library
If you hate to be disorganized, you’ll love iTunes and its nice, neat file storage
methods. Songs are saved with descriptive filenames within album folders,
which are in turn saved within artist folders, and these folders are stored in
the iTunes Music folder.
For example, the song “Here, There and Everywhere” has the track name and
song title in the filename (05 Here, There And Everywhere.mp3). The file-
name extension even tells you the type of encoding format — in this case, MP3.
Note: Songs encoded in AAC have the extension .m4a. This song is saved in the
Revolver folder (for the album), which is in the Beatles folder (for the artist).
What about songs performed by multiple artists, such as duets, or sound-
track albums with multiple artists? Albums and songs designated as part 
of a compilation are stored in album folders within the Compilations folder
rather than within individual artist folders. You can designate a song as part
of a compilation by selecting the song and opening the Song Information
dialog (File➪Get Info), clicking the Info tab, and then selecting the Part of a
Compilation option. You can designate an entire album as a compilation album
(so that the album folder is stored in the Compilations folder) by selecting the
album, opening the Multiple Song Information dialog (File➪Get Info), clicking
Yes to edit multiple songs at once, and then selecting the Part of a Compilation
option by choosing Yes (in the pop-up menu on a Mac or the drop-down menu
in Windows). Even if the choice is already made, choose Yes again to set the
check mark for updating.
You can find the location of any song by selecting the song and choosing File➪
Get Info, and then clicking the Summary tab in the Song Information dialog.
Look in the Kind section of the Summary. If you see (remote) next to the file
format description, the song is not on your hard drive. The Where section
tells you where the song is, as shown in Figure 13-1.
158
Part II: Managing Your Music 

If you access shared libraries on a network, you probably have music in 
your library that’s not actually in your library at all, but rather part of a
shared library or playlist on a network, as we describe in Chapter 6. When
you look at the Summary tab of the Song Information dialog for a song in a
shared library, the Where section does not appear.
All songs that you import are stored in the iTunes Music folder. Even music files
that you drag to the iTunes window are stored here — iTunes makes a copy
and stores the copy in the iTunes Music folder. You need to know where this
folder is so that you can copy music folders or make a backup of your library.
iTunes maintains a separate iTunes folder (with a separate iTunes Music
folder) in each Home folder (Mac) or user folder (PC). If you share your 
computer with other users who have Home folders, each user can have 
a separate music library on the same computer (and, of course, a separate
iPod that synchronizes with it).
On a Mac, iTunes stores your music library inside your Home folder. The
path to this folder is your home folder/Music/iTunes/iTunes Music.
On a Windows PC, iTunes stores your music library inside your User folder.
The path to this folder is your user folder/My Documents/My Music/
iTunes/iTunes Music.
Figure 13-1:

Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Music

To change where iTunes stores your music library, choose Preferences 
(from the iTunes menu on a Mac/the Edit menu on PCs), click Advanced, 
and then click the Change button, which lets you select another location.
The iTunes Music Library file (iTunes Music Library.xml) must be located
within the iTunes folder where iTunes can find it.
Consolidating the iTunes Library
If you have songs stored on different hard drives connected to the same 
computer, you can have iTunes consolidate your music library by copying
everything into the iTunes Music folder. By consolidating your library first,
you make sure that your backup is complete.
To consolidate your music library, choose Advanced➪Consolidate Library.
The original songs remain where they are, but copies are made in your Music
folder.
The Consolidate Library command copies any file ending in .aac, .m4a, or
.mp3 into the Music directory and adds it to the iTunes library — including
any .mp3 sound files used in games, such as Quake. You might want to move
files associated with games to another hard drive or backup disc before 
consolidating.
Exporting iTunes Playlists
With iTunes, you can export a playlist and import it into a different computer
in order to have the same playlist in both places.
You must also copy the songs (or better yet, copy the entire artist folder con-
taining the songs, to keep the songs organized) in order for the playlists on
the other computer to work. Exporting a playlist does not copy the songs in
the playlist. You get a list of songs in the XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
format but not the songs themselves — you still need to copy the actual song
files to the other computer.
To export a single playlist, select the playlist and choose File➪Export Song
List. On a Mac, choose the XML option from the Format pop-up menu in the
Save: iTunes dialog, and click the Save button. On a Windows PC, choose the
XML option from the Files drop-down menu in the Save window.
160
Part II: Managing Your Music 

After exporting a playlist and copying it to another computer, you can import
the playlist into iTunes on the other computer by choosing File➪Import on
that computer, selecting the XML file, and clicking the Choose button. You
can also export all the playlists in your library at the same time by choosing
File➪Export Library; then import them into iTunes on the other computer by
choosing File➪Import and selecting the exported XML file.
Backing Up the iTunes Library 
If you’re like us, your iTunes library is huge. We’ve nearly filled the internal
hard drives of two modern computers, each sporting 80GB of space. And you
thought 80GB would be enough? What about the backup?
Yes, don’t think twice: Backing up can be inconvenient, and it can eat up the
capacity of all your external hard drives — but it must be done. Fortunately,
it’s easy to do. With iTunes, you can copy your library to another hard drive
on your computer or to another computer. You can even copy a library from
a Mac to a PC and vice versa.
Backing up on the same type of computer
To copy your entire music library to another hard drive, locate the iTunes
folder on your computer. Drag this entire folder to another hard drive or
backup device, and you’re all set. This action copies everything, including
the playlists in your library.
The copy operation can take some time if the library is huge. Although you
can stop the operation anytime, the newly copied library might not be com-
plete. Allowing the copy operation to finish is always best.
If you restore the backup copy to the same computer with the same names
for its hard drive, the backup copy’s playlists should work fine. Playlists are
essentially XML lists of songs with pathnames to the song files — if the hard
drive name is different, the pathnames won’t work. However, you can import
the playlists into iTunes by choosing File➪Import, which realigns the playlist
pathnames to the new hard drive. Alternatively, you can use the method
described in “Backing up from Mac to PC or PC to Mac.”
If you just copy just the iTunes Music folder, you are copying the music itself
but not your playlists. You still have to export your playlists — see “Exporting
iTunes Playlists,” earlier in this chapter.
161
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Music

If you use a Mac and subscribe to the Apple .Mac service, you can download
and use the free Backup 2 software, which allows you to save the latest ver-
sions of your files regularly and automatically so you never have to worry
about losing important files. With Backup, you can quickly and easily store
files on your iDisk (a portion of an Internet hard disk hosted by .Mac), or on
CD or DVD as data files (not as CD songs — see Chapter 14 to read how to burn
an audio or MP3 CD). The iDisk is perhaps the least convenient, even though
you do get free space with a .Mac membership. It offers up to 100MB (barely
enough for a few albums), and copying to the iDisk is slow with a modem con-
nection. We use iDisk to transfer individual songs and other large files to other
people and to back up very important documents, but you’re better off using
a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM (or a DVD-RW) as a backup medium for data, as well
as an audio CD for your songs and albums.
Backing up from Mac to PC or PC to Mac
Maybe you use a Mac but you want to transfer your iTunes library to a PC
running iTunes, or the other way ’round. Or perhaps you want a foolproof
method of copying your entire music library to another computer, whether
it’s a Mac or a PC running Windows, or just a computer that uses a different
name for its hard drive (or a different path to the Home folder or user folder).
To back up your iTunes music library no matter what the situation, follow
these steps:
1. Locate your iTunes Music folder on your old computer.
Locate your iTunes Music folder as we describe in “Finding the iTunes
Library,” earlier in this chapter. Call the first computer the old computer
and the one to receive the copied library the new computer.
2. Download and install iTunes on the new computer.
See Chapter 2 for instructions on installing iTunes. If the new computer
already has an iTunes Music folder with music that you want to preserve,
move the iTunes Music folder to another folder on the hard drive, or copy
it to another hard drive or storage medium.
3. Copy the iTunes Music folder from the old computer to the newly
installed iTunes folder of the new computer.
If you have multiple users on the new computer, make sure that you
choose the appropriate user folder for a Windows PC or Home folder 
for a Mac.
4. Choose File➪Export Library on the old computer, browse to a location
on your hard drive or network, and click the Save button.
162
Part II: Managing Your Music 

When you export your entire library, iTunes creates an XML file called
iTunes Music Library.xml that links to music files and stores all your
playlists.
5. Start iTunes on the new computer.
6. Choose File➪Import on the new computer, and import the iTunes
Music Library.xml file.
The music library is now available on the new computer.
Backing Up the MusicMatch 
Jukebox Library
MusicMatch Jukebox libraries are actually collections of links to music files.
Those files can be anywhere on your hard drive, not just in a special folder des-
ignated for such files. (We do recommend designating such a folder because
otherwise you have to hunt for the music files when you want to copy them.)
You can maintain multiple libraries with MusicMatch Jukebox, without using
much hard drive space, because each library is essentially a playlist with
pathnames to the actual music files. You could also have music in your library
that is not actually on your hard drive at all — it could be “streamed” to your
computer over the Internet and never actually stored in a music file on your
drive. (Of course, it also can’t be copied to your iPod.)
Streaming is the process of sending audio to your computer in a protected
set of bits over the network — your computer starts playing the audio as
soon as the first set of bits arrive, and more sections are transferred while
you listen, so that you hear it as a continual stream.
MusicMatch Jukebox stores music files created from recording CDs in folders
inside the My Music folder in your My Documents folder unless you specify
otherwise. The path to this folder on Windows XP or Windows 2000 is typi-
cally your user folder/My Documents/My Music, and inside this folder
are folders organized by artist name.
Yes, consolidating all your song files in one place for easy backup might be
time-consuming. Consider using disk backup software that copies all your files,
or perhaps selectively copy the music files as you see fit. You can find out the
location of any song’s music file by selecting the song and right-clicking (using
the alternate mouse button) to show the contextual menu, and choosing Open
File Location.
163
Chapter 13: Gimme Shelter for My Music

Saving Multiple MusicMatch 
Jukebox Libraries
Because music libraries are essentially links to music files, they can be 
saved as separate library files as well as exported in a text database format.
To save a music library, choose Options➪Music Library➪Save Music Library
As. MusicMatch Jukebox saves the file with the filename extension .ddf, as
in yourlibrary.ddf, which is the MusicMatch Jukebox-specific format for
music library files.
You can save as many different music libraries as you want, such as libraries
dedicated to specific types of music or libraries associated with different
people. Each one can be used to synchronize with a separate iPod, or you
can update one iPod manually from different libraries.
To load a saved music library, choose Options➪Music Library➪Open Music
Library, and browse for the saved music library, which should have the .ddf
extension. You can also import an entire music library into another music
library — thus combining the two libraries — by choosing Options➪Music
Library➪Import Music Library.
If you’ve moved your music files or renamed any folders in the path to your
music files and MusicMatch Jukebox can’t find the music file associated with
a song, choose Options➪Music Library➪Repair Broken Links, and browse to
the folder where the music file now resides.

Burning CDs from iTunes
In This Chapter
 Creating a burn playlist
 Choosing the right format for burning a CD
 Setting the burn preferences
 Burning a CD
 Exporting song information
 Troubleshooting tips
O
nce upon a time, when vinyl records were popular, rock radio disk jockeys
who didn’t like disco held disco meltdown parties. People were encour-
aged to throw their disco records into a pile to be burned or steamrolled into a
vinyl glob. This chapter isn’t about that; neither is it about anything involving
fire nor heat.
Rather, burning a CD refers to the process in which the CD drive recorder’s
laser heats up points on an interior layer of the disc, simulating the pits
pressed into commercial CDs that represent digital information.
People burn CDs for a lot of reasons — reason numero uno is to make a backup
of songs on your computer. Perhaps having your 12 favorite love songs on one
CD for your next romantic encounter is convenient, or perhaps you want to
burn a few CDs of obscure songs to impress your friends on your next big
road trip. 

This chapter burns, er, boils everything down for you by telling you what kind
of discs to use, which devices you can use to play the discs, how to get your
playlist ready for burning, and what settings to use for burning. You find out
what you need to know to make sure that your burns are not meltdowns —
that the only melting is the music in your ears.
Selecting Recordable CDs
After importing music into your iTunes library, you can arrange any songs in
your library into a playlist and burn a CD using that playlist (see Chapter 10
for more on creating playlists). If you have a CD-R, CD-RW, or DVD-R drive
(such as the Apple SuperDrive for Macs), and a blank CD-R (R stands for
recordable), you can create your own music CDs that play in most CD players.
Blank CD-Rs are available in most electronics and computer stores, and 
even supermarkets. You can also get them online from the Apple Store 
(not the music store — the store that sells computers and accessories).
Choose iTunes➪Shop for iTunes Products on a Mac or the Help➪Shop 
for iTunes Products on a Windows PC to reach the Apple Store online.
The discs are called CD-R because they use a recordable format related to
commercial audio CDs (which are not recordable, of course). You can also
create a disc in the new MP3 format by creating a CD-R with data rather than
music, which is useful for backing up a music library.
CD-Rs play just like regular audio CDs in most CD players, including car players
and portable CD players. The CD-R format is the most universal and compati-
ble with older players.
Many CD burners, such as the Apple SuperDrive, also burn CD-RWs (record-
able, read-write discs) that you can erase and reuse, but CD players don’t
always recognize them as music CDs. Some burners can create data DVD-Rs
and DVD-RWs also, which are useful for holding data files, but you can only
use these discs with computers that have DVD drives. Most commercial DVD
players won’t read a data DVD-R or DVD-RW.
You can play MP3 files burned on a CD-R in the MP3 format on the new con-
sumer MP3 disc players and combination CD/MP3 players as well as on many
DVD players, and of course on computers that recognize MP3 CDs (including
computers with iTunes).
166
Part II: Managing Your Music 

What You Can Fit on a CD-R
You can fit up to 74 minutes of music on a high-quality CD-R; some can go as
high as 80 minutes. The sound files on your hard drive might take up more
space than 650 MB if they are uncompressed, but you can still fit 74 minutes
(or 80 minutes, depending on the disc) because the CD format stores infor-
mation more efficiently.
If you burn music to a CD-R in the MP3 format, the disc can hold more than
12 hours worth of music. You read that right — 12 hours on one disc. Now
you know why MP3 discs are popular. MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with
MP3 files stored on them.
If you have a DVD burner, such as the Apple SuperDrive, you can burn data
DVD-Rs or DVD-RWs to use with other computers. This approach is suitable
for making backup copies of music files (or any data files). A DVD-R can hold
about 4,700,000,000 bytes (about 4.38GB), which is enough to hold part of a
music library.
To burn a CD-RW or DVD-RW that already has data on it, you must first erase
it by reformatting it using the application supplied with the drive. CD-RWs
and DVD-RWs work with computers but won’t work with consumer players.
167
Chapter 14: Burning CDs from iTunes
The little Red Book that launched an industry
The typical audio CD and CD-R uses the CD-DA
(Compact Disc-Digital Audio) format, which is
known as Red Book — not something from
Chairman Mao, but a document, published in
1980, that provides the specifications for the
standard compact disc (CD) developed by Sony
and Philips. According to legend, this document
was in a binder with red covers.
Also according to legend, in 1979, Norio Ohga,
honorary chairman and former CEO of Sony
(who’s also a maestro conductor), overruled his
engineers and insisted that the CD format be
able to hold Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony (which
is 74 minutes and 42 seconds — now the stan-
dard length of a Red Book audio CD).
CD-DA defines audio data digitized at 44,100
samples per second (44.1 kHz) and in a range of
65,536 possible values (16 bits). 
To import music into the computer from an audio
CD, you have to convert the music to digital sound
files by a program such as iTunes. When you burn
an audio CD, iTunes converts the sound files back
into the CD-DA format as it burns the disc.

Creating a Burn Playlist
To burn a CD, you must first define a playlist for the CD. See Chapter 10 to
find out how to create a playlist. You can use songs encoded in any format
that iTunes supports; however, you get higher quality music with the uncom-
pressed formats AIFF and WAV.
To copy an album you already have in your iTunes library onto an audio CD,
you can quickly create a playlist for the album by switching to Browse view
in your iTunes library and dragging an album from the Album list (in the top-
right section of the window in Browse view) to the white area below the items
in your Source pane. iTunes automatically creates a playlist with the album
name. You can then use that playlist to burn a CD.
If your playlist includes music purchased from the iTunes Music Store or
other online stores in the protected AAC encoding format, some rules might
apply. For example, the iTunes Music Store allows you to burn ten copies of
the same playlist containing protected songs to an audio CD, but no more.
You can, however, create a new playlist and copy the protected songs to the
new playlist, and then burn more CDs with the songs.
Calculating how much music to use
When you create a playlist, you find out how many songs can fit on the CD
by totaling the durations of the songs, using time as your measure. You can
see the size of a playlist by selecting it; the bottom of the iTunes window
shows the number of songs, the amount in time, and the amount in
megabytes for the currently selected playlist, as shown in Figure 14-1.
Figure 14-1:
Check the
duration of
the playlist
below the
song list.
168
Part II: Managing Your Music 

In Figure 14-1, the selected playlist has 23 songs that total 1.1 hours and
724.1MB. (Note: The songs were encoded in the AIFF format.) You might
notice the discrepancy between the megabytes (724.1) and what you can 
fit on an audio CD (650). Although a CD holds between 650MB and 700MB
(depending on the disc), the music is stored in a special format known as 
CD-DA (or Red Book) that fills byte sectors more efficiently. Thus, you can 
fit a bit more than 650MB of AIFF-encoded music on a 650MB disc. We can fit
1.1 hours (66 minutes) of music on a 74-minute or 80-minute CD-R with many
minutes to spare.
Always use the actual duration in hours, minutes, and seconds to calculate
how much music you can fit on an audio CD — either 74 or 80 minutes for
blank CD-Rs. Leave at least one extra minute to account for the gaps between
songs.
You do the opposite for an MP3 CD — you use the actual megabytes to calcu-
late how many songs can fit on a disc — up to 700MB for a blank CD-R. You
can fit lots more music on an MP3 CD-R because you use MP3-encoded songs
rather than uncompressed AIFF songs.
If you have too many songs in the playlist to fit on a CD-R, iTunes will burn as
many songs in the playlist as will fit on the CD-R (either audio or MP3), and
then it will ask you to insert another CD-R to continue burning the remaining
songs in the playlist.
Importing music for an audio CD-R 
Before you rip an audio CD of songs you want to burn to an audio CD-R, you
might want to change the import settings. Check out Chapter 19 if you need
to do so. Use AIFF or WAV for songs from audio CDs if you want to burn your
own audio CDs with music.
AIFF is the standard digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and you
can’t go wrong with it. WAV is basically the same thing for Windows. Both the
AIFF Encoder and the WAV Encoder offer the same Custom settings dialog,
with settings for sample rate, sample size, and channels. You can choose the
automatic settings, and iTunes automatically detects the proper sample rate,
size, and channels from the source.
Songs that you purchase from the iTunes Music Store come in the protected
AAC format, which you can’t convert to anything else.
The AAC music file format is a higher quality format than MP3, comparable to
CD quality. We think that it offers a decent trade-off of space and quality and
is suitable (although not as good as AIFF or Apple lossless) for burning to an
audio CD.
169
Chapter 14: Burning CDs from iTunes

Switching import encoders for MP3 CD-R 
MP3 discs are essentially CD-Rs with MP3 files stored on them using the ISO
9660 file structure that is standard across computers and players. Consumer
MP3 CD players are now on the market, including hybrid models that play
both audio CDs and MP3 CDs.
You can fit an average of 12 hours of music on a CD using the MP3 format,
although this amount can vary widely (along with audio quality) depending
on the encoding options and settings you choose. For example, you might 
be able to fit up to 20 hours of mono (monaural) recordings because they 
use only one channel and carry less information. On the other hand, if you
encode stereo recordings at high bit rates (above 192 bits per second), you
will fit less than 12 hours. If you rip an audio CD, you can set the importing
options to precisely the type of MP3 file you want (see Chapter 19).
You can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not
encoded in MP3 are skipped and not burned to the CD-R. Audible books and
spoken-word titles are provided in an audio format that uses security tech-
nologies, including encryption, to protect purchased content. You can’t burn
an MP3 CD-R with Audible files; any Audible files in a burn playlist are skipped
when you burn an MP3 CD-R.
Setting the Burning Preferences
Burning a CD is a simple process, and getting it right the first time is a good
idea because when you burn a CD-R, it’s done one time — right or wrong. 
You can’t erase content on a CD-R like you can with a CD-RW. Because you
can’t play a CD-RW in as many CD players, if you want to burn an audio CD,
we recommend using a CD-R. Fortunately, CD-Rs are inexpensive, so you
won’t be out more than a few cents if you burn a coaster (a bad CD-R).
Setting the sound check and gaps
Musicians do a sound check before every performance to check the volume of
microphones and instruments and their effect on the listening environment.
The aptly named Sound Check option in iTunes allows you to do a sound check
on your tunes to bring them all in line, volume-wise.
To have all the songs in your library play at the same volume level all the time,
choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac or Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC.
In the Preferences dialog, click the Audio tab. Select the Sound Check check
170
Part II: Managing Your Music 

box, as shown in Figure 14-2, which sets all the songs to the current volume
controlled by the iTunes volume slider.
After enabling Sound Check, you can burn your audio CD-R so that all the
songs play back at the same volume, just like they do in iTunes. Choose
iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and 
then click the Burning button. Select the Use Sound Check option, as shown
in Figure 14-3. Note: This option is active only if you are already using the
Sound Check option in the Audio preferences.

Chapter 14: Burning CDs from iTunes

Consistent volume for all tracks makes the CD-R sound professional. Another
professional touch is to add an appropriate gap between songs, just like com-
mercial CDs. Follow these steps to control the length of the gap between the
songs on your audio CD-R (not MP3 CD-R):
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, and then click the Burning tab in the Preferences
dialog.
The Burning Preferences appear (refer to Figure 14-3).
2. Choose an amount from the Gap between Songs pop-up menu.
You can choose from a gap of 0 to 5 seconds. We recommend selecting a
gap of 2 seconds.
3. Click OK.
Setting the format and recording speed 
Before burning a CD-R, you have to set the disc format and the recording
speed. Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac/Edit menu on 
a Windows PC), and then click the Burning tab in the Preferences dialog.
The Disc Format setting in the Burning dialog (refer to Figure 14-3) offers
three choices:
 Audio CD: Choose this to burn a normal audio CD of up to 74 or 80 min-
utes (depending on the type of blank CD-R) using any iTunes-supported
music files, including songs bought from the iTunes Music Store. Although
connoisseurs of music might use AIFF-encoded or WAV-encoded music to
burn an audio CD, you can also use songs in the AAC and MP3 formats.
 MP3 CD: Choose this to burn an MP3 CD with songs encoded in the MP3
format. No other formats are supported for MP3 CD.
 Data CD or DVD: Choose this to burn a data CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, 
or DVD-RW with the music files. You can use any encoding formats 
for the songs. Important: Data discs won’t play on most consumer 
CD players — they are meant for use with computers. However, data
discs are good choices for storing copies of music bought from the
iTunes Music Store.
Blank CD-Rs are rated for recording at certain speeds. iTunes typically detects
the rating of a blank CD-R and adjusts the recording speed to fit. However, if
your blank CD-Rs are rated for a slower speed than your burner, or you have
problems creating CD-Rs, you can change the recording speed setting to match
172
Part II: Managing Your Music 

the CD’s rating. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, and then click the Burning tab in the Preferences dialog. From
the Preferred Speed pop-up menu or drop-down list in the Burning Preferences,
choose a specific recording speed or choose the Maximum Possible option to
set the recording speed to your burner’s maximum speed.
Burning a Disc
After you set the burning preferences, you’re ready to start burning. Follow
these steps to burn a CD:
1. Select the playlist designated for burning a disc and click the Burn
Disc button.
A message appears telling you to insert a blank disc.
2. Insert a blank disc (label side up).
iTunes immediately checks the media and displays a message in the
status window that the disc is ready to burn.
3. Click the Burn Disc button again.
This time, the button has a radiation symbol. The burn process begins.
The “radioactive” button rotates while the burning takes place, and a
progress bar appears with the names of the songs displayed as they
burn to the disc.
When iTunes has finished burning the CD, iTunes chimes, and the CD is
mounted on the Desktop.
4. Eject the newly burned disc from your CD drive and test it.
Burning takes several minutes. You can cancel the operation at any time by
clicking the X next to the progress bar, but canceling the operation isn’t like
undoing the burn. If the burn has already started, you can’t use the CD-R or
DVD-R again.
If the playlist has more music than fits on the disc using the chosen format,
iTunes burns as much as possible from the beginning of the playlist, and then
asks you to insert another disc to burn the rest. To calculate the amount of
music in a playlist, turn to the section, “Calculating how much music to use,”
earlier in this chapter.
If you choose the MP3 CD format, iTunes skips over any songs in the playlist
that are not in the MP3 format.
173
Chapter 14: Burning CDs from iTunes

Printing Liner Notes and CD Covers
Don’t delete the playlist yet! You can print the CD liner notes and covers using
any artwork you have assigned to the songs in the playlist (as described in
Chapter 9). 
Select the playlist, and choose File➪Print to see a print dialog box with choices
for CD inserts and liner notes. You can print a CD jewel case insert, a song
listing, or an album listing. If you choose a CD jewel case, you have a choice
of themes such as Text Only (without song artwork), Mosaic (with artwork
from songs arranged in a mosaic), Single Cover (with one song’s artwork),
and so on. If you choose a song listing, the Theme pop-up menu changes to
provide options for columns in the song list
If you want to print liner notes in a layout that iTunes doesn’t offer in its print-
ing themes, you can export the song information for all the songs in a playlist
to a text file, and then edit that information in a word processor or page layout
program to make liner notes for the CD. iTunes exports all the song informa-
tion for a single song, a playlist, an album, songs by an artist, or songs in the
library into a text file. Select the songs or playlist and choose File➪Export Song
List. In the Export Song List dialog, make sure that the Plain Text option is
selected from the Format pop-up menu (unless you use a double-byte language,
such as Japanese or Chinese, for which the Unicode option is the right choice).
Troubleshooting Burns
Murphy’s Law applies to everything, even something as simple as burning 
a CD-R. Don’t think for a moment that you are immune to the whims and
treacheries of Murphy (no one really knows who Murphy is), who in all his
infinite wisdom, pronounced that anything that can go wrong will go wrong.
In this section, we cover some of the most common problems that you might
encounter when burning CDs.
The best way to test your newly burned disc is to pop it right back into your
computer’s CD-ROM drive, or try it on a consumer CD player. On most CD play-
ers, an audio CD-R plays just like any commercial audio CD. MP3 CDs play fine
on consumer MP3 CD players and also work in computers with CD-ROM and
DVD drives.
If the CD works on the computer but not on a commercial CD player, you might
have a compatibility problem with the commercial player and CD-R. We have
a five-year-old CD player that doesn’t play CD-Rs very well, and car players
sometimes have trouble with them.
174
Part II: Managing Your Music 

The following list gives some typical problems that you might run into when
burning a CD, along with the solutions to those problems:
 Problem: The disc won’t burn.
Solution: Perhaps you have a bum disc. Hey, it happens. Try using
another disc or burning at a slower speed.
 Problem: In a consumer CD player, the disc doesn’t play, or it stutters
when playing.
Solution: This happens often with older consumer players that don’t
play CD-Rs well. Try the disc in your computer’s CD-ROM drive. If it
works there and you set the format to Audio CD, you probably have a
compatibility problem with your consumer player.
 Problem: The disc doesn’t show tracks on a consumer CD player, or it
ejects immediately.
Solution: Be sure to use the proper disc format — choose iTunes➪
Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC, and click the
Burning tab to see the Disc Format setting in the Burning dialog. The
Audio CD format works in just about all consumer CD players that can
play CD-Rs. MP3 CDs work in consumer MP3 CD players and computer
CD-ROM and DVD drives. Data CDs or DVDs work only in computer drives.
 Problem: Some songs in my playlist were skipped and not burned onto
the disc.
Solution: Audio CD-Rs burn with songs encoded in any format, but you
can use only MP3-encoded songs to burn an MP3 CD-R. Any songs not
encoded in MP3 are skipped. (Any Audible files are also skipped, which
can’t be put onto an MP3 CD.) If your playlist for an audio CD-R includes
music purchased from the iTunes Music Store, some rules might apply —
see the section, “Creating a Burn Playlist,” earlier in this chapter.
Don’t violate copyright law.

Your iPod is lightweight enough to carry everywhere but also heavy with
thousands of songs, representing a cross-section of the history of rock
music — a veritable museum in your hands. Or perhaps you have every pop-
ular song that made the charts in the last few years or every jazz note played
between 1960 and 1966. You spent a few minutes creating playlists in iTunes
that barely scratch the surface of the huge library you have in your hands.
Now how do you switch songs or playlists while maintaining your jogging
pace or avoiding wrecks on the freeway?
After you add music to your iPod, you can locate and play that music easily,
browsing by artist and album, and even by composer. Selecting a playlist is
simplicity itself, and if you don’t have playlists from iTunes (or you don’t
want to hear those playlists), you can create a temporary On-The-Go playlist.
This chapter shows you how to do all these things.
Locating Songs
With so many songs on your iPod, finding a particular one can be hard (like
finding a needle in a haystack, or trying to find “Needle in a Haystack” by the
Velvelettes in the Motown catalog) — even though you can narrow your search
by genre, and also search by artist, composer, album, or playlist. 

By artist
Your iPod organizes music by artist, and within each artist by album. Follow
these steps to locate a song by artist and then album:
1. Select the Browse item from the iPod main menu.
Scroll the main menu until Browse is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The Browse menu appears.
2. Select the Artists item.
The Artists item is at the top of the Browse menu and should already be
highlighted; if not, scroll the menu until Artists is highlighted, and then
press the Select button. The Artists menu appears.
To browse by genre, select the Genres item, and then select a genre from
the Genres menu to get a reduced list of artists that have songs in that
genre (in alphabetical order by artist name).
3. Select an artist from the Artists menu.
The artists’ names are listed in alphabetical order by first word. Note: Any
leading The is ignored so that The Beatles appears where Beatles would be
in the list. Scroll the Artists menu until the artist name (such as Radiohead
or Bowie, David) is highlighted, and then press the Select button. The
artist’s menu of albums appears. For example, the Radiohead menu in
our iPod includes the selections All, OK Computer, and The Bends; the
Bowie, David menu includes All, Heroes, Ziggy Stardust, and many more).
4. Select the All item or the name of an album from the artist’s menu.
The All item is at the top of the artist’s menu and should already be high-
lighted; you can press the Select button to select it or scroll until an album
name is highlighted and then press the Select button. Note: Albums are
listed in alphabetical order based on the first word. A leading A or The
is not ignored, so the album The Basement Tapes is listed after the album
Stage Fright in The Band’s menu. A song list appears after you select a
choice.
5. Select the song from the list.
The songs in the album list are in album order (the order they appear on
the album); in the All list, songs are listed in album order for each album.
Scroll up or down the list to highlight the song.
By album
Follow these steps to locate a song by album directly:
1. Select the Browse item from the iPod main menu.
180
Part III: Playing Tunes 

Scroll the main menu until Browse is highlighted, and then press the
Select button. The Browse menu appears.
2. Select the Albums item.
Scroll the Browse menu until Albums is highlighted, and then press
the Select button. The Albums menu appears.
Select the Composers item to choose a composer, and then select a com-
poser from the Composers menu to get a list of songs for that composer.
3. Select an album from the Albums menu.
The albums are listed in alphabetical order (without any reference to
artist, which might make identification difficult). The order is by first
word (a leading A, An, or The is not ignored, so the album The Natch’l
Blues is listed after Taj’s Blues in the T section rather than the N section).
Scroll the Albums menu until the album name is highlighted and then
press the Select button. A song list appears.
4. Select the song from the list.
The songs in the album list are in the order in which they appear on the
album. Scroll the list to highlight the song name and press the Select
button. The artist name and song name appear.
By playlist
When you update your iPod automatically from your entire iTunes library, all
of your playlists in iTunes are copied to the iPod. You can choose to update
your iPod with only specified playlists, as we describe in Chapter 11.
Playlists make playing a selection of songs or albums in a specific order easy.
The playlist plays from the first song selected to the end of the playlist.
Follow these steps to locate a song by playlist on your iPod:
1. Select the Playlists item from the iPod main menu.
The Playlists item is at the top of the main menu and might already be
highlighted. If not, scroll the main menu until Playlists is highlighted,
and then press the Select button. The Playlists menu appears.
2. Select a playlist.
The playlists are listed in alphabetical order. Scroll the Playlists menu
to highlight the playlist name, and then press the Select button. A list of
songs in the playlist appears.
3. Select the song from the list.
The songs in the playlist are in playlist order (the order defined for the play-
list in iTunes). Scroll up or down the list to highlight the song you want.
181
Chapter 15: Playing Your iPod

Playing a Song
After scrolling the song list until the song name is highlighted, press the
Select button to play the selected song, or press the Play/Pause button —
either button starts the song playing. When the song finishes, the iPod 
continues playing the next song in the song list.
While a song is playing, the artist name and song name appear, and you can
use the scroll wheel to adjust the volume. See the section, “Adjusting the
Volume,” later in this chapter.
Press the Play/Pause button when a song is playing to pause the playback.
Because the iPod is a hard drive, pause is the same as stop, and you won’t
find any delay in resuming playback.
Repeating Songs
If you want to drive yourself crazy repeating the same song over and over, the
iPod is happy to oblige. More than likely, you’ll want to repeat a sequence of
songs, which you can easily do.
You can set the iPod to repeat a single song automatically by following these
steps:
1. Locate and play a song.
2. As the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the
main menu, and then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until Repeat is highlighted.
The Repeat setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button once (Off changes to One) to repeat one song.
If you press the button more than once, keep pressing until One appears.
You can also press the Previous/Rewind button to repeat a song.
To repeat all the songs in the selected album or playlist, follow these steps:
1. Locate and play a song in the album or playlist.
2. As the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the
main menu, and then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
182
Part III: Playing Tunes 

3. Scroll the Settings menu until the Repeat item is highlighted.
The Repeat setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button twice (Off changes to All) to repeat all the
songs in the album or playlist.
Shuffling the Song Order
You can also shuffle songs within an album, playlist, or the entire library. 
By shuffle, we mean play in random order — like an automated radio station
without a disk jockey talking between songs.
Follow these steps to shuffle songs in an album or playlist:
1. Locate and play a song in the album or playlist.
2. As the song plays, press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the
main menu, and then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
3. Scroll the Settings menu until the Shuffle item is highlighted.
The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
4. Press the Select button once (Off changes to Songs) to shuffle the
songs in the selected album or playlist.
You can set your iPod to repeat an album or playlist but still shuffle the play-
ing order.
To shuffle all the albums in your iPod while still playing the songs in each
album in normal album order, follow these steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the main menu, and
then select the Settings item.
The Settings menu appears.
2. Scroll the Settings menu until the Shuffle item is highlighted.
The Shuffle setting displays Off next to it.
3. Press the Select button twice (Off changes to Albums) to shuffle the
albums without shuffling the songs within each album.
When the iPod is set to shuffle, it won’t repeat a song until it has played
through the entire album, playlist, or library.
183
Chapter 15: Playing Your iPod

Creating On-The-Go Playlists
If you don’t have playlists from iTunes (or you don’t want to hear those
playlists), you can create a temporary On-The-Go playlist (which works in
iPods using iPod software version 2.0 and newer, including iPod mini, but not in
first-generation and second-generation iPods).You can select a list of songs or
entire albums to play in a certain order, queuing up the songs or albums on the
iPod. This is particularly useful for picking songs to play right before starting to
drive a car. (Hel-lo! — you shouldn’t be messing with your iPod while driving.)
Queued songs appear automatically in a playlist called On-The-Go in the
Playlists menu. (To use the Playlists menu, see the sections, “Locating Songs”
and “Playing a Song,” earlier in this chapter.) This playlist stays in your iPod
until you clear it (deleting the songs from the playlist) or update your iPod
with new music and playlists. You can also save in your iTunes library the
On-The-Go playlist that you created on an iPod.
Selecting songs for the playlist 
To select songs or entire albums for an On-The-Go playlist, follow these steps:
1. Locate and highlight a song or album title.
2. Press and hold the Select button until the title flashes.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 in the order you want the songs or albums played.
To play the On-The-Go playlist, scroll the main menu until Playlists is high-
lighted, and then press the Select button. The Playlists menu appears. Scroll
to the On-The-Go item, which you can always find at the very end of the list
in the Playlists menu.
You can continue to add songs to the list of queued songs in the On-The-Go
playlist at any time. Your iPod saves the On-The-Go playlist until you clear it.
Clearing songs from the playlist
To clear the list of queued songs, follow these steps:
1. Press the Menu button repeatedly to return to the main menu, and
then select the Playlists item.
The Playlists menu appears.
2. Select the On-The-Go item.
The song list in the On-The-Go playlist appears.
184
Part III: Playing Tunes 

3. Scroll to the very end of the song list, and select the Clear Playlist item.
The Clear menu appears.
4. Select the Clear Playlist item.
The songs disappear from the playlist. The songs are still in your iPod,
of course — only the playlist is cleared.
Saving the playlist in iTunes
You can save the On-The-Go playlist — perhaps the songs you selected (or the
order you selected them in) inspired you somehow, and you want to repeat
the experience. You can save the On-The-Go playlist so that it shows up in
iTunes as another one of your personal playlists, and you can give it a new
name if you want. The playlist can then be transferred to the iPod during an
update, just like your other playlists.
If you don’t clear the list of queued songs in the On-The-Go playlist, the next
time you automatically synchronize your iPod to iTunes (as we describe in
Chapter 11), the playlist is automatically copied to your iTunes library as 
On-The-Go 1 (the next list is On-The-Go 2, and so on). You can keep track of
your On-The-Go playlists this way. Or if you want to save your On-The-Go
playlists with a new name, you can rename them in iTunes, as shown in
Figure 15-1.
When updating your iPod manually, as we describe in Chapter 11, you can
drag the On-The-Go playlist from your iPod library to the iTunes library.

Chapter 15: Playing Your iPod

Adjusting the Volume
The iPod is quite loud when set to its highest volume — you should turn it
down before using headphones. To adjust the volume, follow these steps:
1. Select and play a song on the iPod.
2. Change the volume with the scroll wheel.
A volume bar appears in the iPod display to guide you. Scroll with your
thumb or finger clockwise to increase the volume, and counterclockwise
to decrease the volume.
If you have the Apple iPod Remote — a handy controller that attaches by
cable to the iPod headphone connection — you can use the volume button
on the remote to adjust the volume. You can also use the remote controller to
play or pause a song, fast-forward or rewind, and skip to the next or previous
song. You can disable the buttons on the remote by setting the controller’s
Hold switch (similar to the iPod Hold switch).
Bookmarking Audible Audio Books
Audible books, articles, and spoken-word titles are stored and played just like
songs in iTunes and your iPod. (You can download titles from www.audible.
com.) When you play an Audible title, you can automatically bookmark your
place in the text with the iPod. Bookmarks work only with Audible titles. If you
have an audio book or spoken-word file in any other format, such as MP3,
bookmarks are not available.
When you use the Pause/Play button to pause an Audible file, the iPod auto-
matically bookmarks that spot. When you press the Play button again, the
Audible file starts playing from that spot.
Bookmarks synchronize when you copy an Audible title to your iPod —
whichever bookmark is farther along in iPod or iTunes becomes the effective
bookmark.

Getting Wired for Sound

 Using the Apple Remote or a wireless remote control
S
ound studio engineers try to make recordings for typical listening 
environments, so they have to simulate the sound experience in those
environments. Studios typically have home stereo speakers as monitors so
that the engineers can hear what the music sounds like on a home stereo. 
In the 1950s and early 1960s, when AM radio was king, engineers working on
potential AM radio hits purposely mixed the sound with low-fidelity monaural
speakers so that they could hear what the mix would sound like on radio.
Thank goodness those days are over, and cars offer higher-quality FM radio
as well as very high quality audio systems.
The point is that the quality of the sound is no better than the weakest link 
in the audio system. Songs from older times that were mixed to a mono
(single) channel for car radios don’t sound as good even when played on 
a home stereo.
The audio CD bridges the gap between home stereos, car stereos, and
portable CD players by enabling you to listen to high-quality music any-
where as long as you have a decent pair of headphones. Music production
changed considerably over the last few decades as more people listened 
to higher-quality FM radio; bought massive home stereos; and eventually

bought CD players for their cars, and boats and purchased portable players
to use while flying and jogging. At each step, popular music was reissued in
the new medium, such as audio CD, and remixed in the process for the new
sound systems.
The iPod represents a major leap forward in bridging the gap between home
stereos, car stereos, and portable players. Picking up where CDs left off, the
iPod offers nearly as high quality sound as an audio CD in a convenient device
that can hold several weeks’ worth of music. What’s more, you can tweak the
sound not just for home stereos, but for all listening environments. 
Making Connections
The sleek iPod models enable you to connect headphones to your iPod, or
connect your iPod to your home stereo, or connect your iPod to your Mac.
The connections, as shown in Figure 16-1 (third-generation models) and
Figure 16-2 (first- and second-generation models), are as follows:
 FireWire: Current (third-generation) models and iPod mini have a 
dock connection on the bottom for inserting into the dock or using 
with the dock connector cable, which has a dock connector on one 
end and a FireWire connector (or optional USB connector, or both
FireWire and USB connectors with a split cable) on the other. First-
generation and second-generation iPods have a six-pin FireWire 
connection on the top that works with any standard six-pin FireWire
cable.
 Headphone/line out (with remote control socket): The combination
headphone and control socket connection on the top of the iPod allows
you to plug in the Apple iPod Remote, which in turn offers a headphone/
line-out connection. (The Apple iPod Remote comes standard with the
iPod). The remote offers playback and volume control buttons. You can
also connect headphones, or a 3.5mm stereo mini-plug cable, to the
headphone/line-out connection.
 Dock connections: For third-generation iPod models, the dock offers two
connections: one for the special cable to connect to a FireWire (or USB)
connection, and a headphone/line-out connection for a stereo mini-plug
cable (or headphones).
You can connect the FireWire end to the computer (for synchronizing with
iTunes and playing the iPod through iTunes, as we describe in Chapter 18) 
or to the power adapter to charge the iPod battery. The FireWire connec-
tion to the computer provides power to the iPod as long as the computer’s
FireWire hardware offers power to the device and the computer isn’t in 
sleep mode.

Connecting to a Home Stereo
Home stereo systems come in many shapes and sizes, from an audiophile’s
monster component racks to a kid’s itty-bitty boom box. We’re not talking
about alarm-clock radios, but stereos with speakers that allow you to add
another input device, such as a portable CD player. 
Component-style stereo systems typically include a receiver (which offers a
preamp/amplifier with a volume control, and a tuner to receive FM radio). Some
separate these functions into separate components — such as a preamp, an
amplifier, and a tuner. To find a place to connect your iPod or computer to a
home stereo, look for RCA-type connections that are marked AUX IN (for auxil-
iary input), CD IN (for connecting a CD player), or TAPE IN (for tape deck input).
All-in-one stereos and boom boxes that are all one piece typically don’t have
connections for audio input, although there are exceptions — look at the back
and sides of the unit for any RCA-type connections. 
You can connect a CD or tape player to most stereos with RCA-type cables —
one (typically red or black) for the right channel, and one (typically white if
the other is black, or white or black if the other is red) for the left channel. All
you need is a cable with a stereo mini-plug on one end and RCA-type connec-
tors on the other, as shown in Figure 16-3. Stereo mini-plugs have two black
bands on the plug, but a mono mini-plug has only one black band.
The Monster high-performance iCable for iPod (formerly called the Monster
Cable) available in the Apple Store, looks cool and offers high-quality sound
for the discerning listener with excellent stereo equipment. 
Connect the stereo mini-plug to the iPod dock headphone/line-out connection
(refer to Figure 16-1), or to the headphone/line-out connection on the top of
the iPod. Connect the left and right connectors to the stereo system’s audio
input — whatever connections are available, such as AUX IN (for auxiliary
input); TAPE IN (for tape deck input); or CD IN (for CD player input).
Don’t use the PHONO IN connection (for phonograph input) on most stereos.
These connections are for phonographs (turntables) and aren’t properly
matched for other kinds of input devices. If you do this, you might get a 
loud buzzing sound that could damage your speakers.

Part III: Playing Tunes 

You can control the volume from the iPod by using the scroll wheel, which we
describe in Chapter 15. This controls the volume of the signal from the iPod.
Stereo systems typically have their own volume control to raise or lower the
volume of the amplified speakers. For optimal sound quality when using a
home stereo, set the iPod volume at less than half the maximum output and
adjust your listening volume by using your stereo controls. By doing this, you
prevent over-amplification, which can cause distortion and reduce audio
quality.
Connecting Headphones 
and Portable Speakers
Apple designed the iPod to provide excellent sound through headphones, and
with the headphone/line-out connection, the iPod can also play music through
portable speaker systems. The speaker systems must be self-powered or able
to work with very little power (like headphones) and allow audio to be input
through a 3.5mm mini-plug stereo connection.
The iPod includes a small amplifier powerful enough to deliver audio through
the headphone/line-out connection. It has a frequency response of 20 Hz
(hertz) to 20,000 Hz, which provides distortion-free music at the lowest or
highest pitches. Hertz has nothing to do with rental cars — a hertz is a unit of
frequency equal to one cycle per second. At pitches that produce frequencies
of 20 cycles per second, or 20,000 cycles per second, the iPod responds with
distortion-free sound.
Portable speaker systems typically include built-in amplifiers and a volume
control, and offer a stereo mini-plug that you can attach directly to the iPod
headphone/line-out connection or to the dock headphone/line-out connec-
tion. To place the external speakers farther away from the iPod, use a stereo
mini-plug extension cable — available at most consumer electronics stores —
which has a stereo mini-plug on one end and a stereo mini-socket on the
other.
Portable speaker systems typically have volume controls to raise or lower
the volume. Set your iPod volume to half and then raise or lower the volume
of your speaker system.
When you travel, take an extra pair of headphones (or earbuds) and a
splitter cable, such as the one in Figure 16-4, available in any consumer 
electronics store. The Monster iSplitter is available in the Apple Store. You
can plug both headphones into the iPod and share the music with someone
on the road.

Chapter 16: Getting Wired for Sound

Accessories for the iHome
No home should be without an iPod on a pedestal, raising it above the desk
clutter so that you can see its display and use its controls. Although you can
play the music in your iTunes library from your computer, you might want to
use the iPod in another room that has a stereo system, or you might want to
play the iPod, freeing the computer to do other things.
Most of the accessories for the iPod (and hundreds of products are available)
are designed for travel, and we describe the best in Chapter 17. However,
companies also provide docks and stands for older iPods that don’t have
docks, as well as alternatives to the limited Apple Remote that connects by
cable to the iPod.
The $30 iPodDock from Bookendz (www.bookendzdocks.com) supports the
older iPod models in an upside down position on a desk or table and offers
connection ports (audio and FireWire) for instant docking. The iPodCradle,
also from Bookendz, supports the iPod in an upright position and is compatible
with most cases on the market, so you can use your iPod in the cradle with
or without the case. Bookendz also offers an iPodDock for third-generation
iPods as an alternative to the standard Apple dock.

Part III: Playing Tunes 

The Apple Remote, which is supplied with some models and optional with
others, provides the usual CD player controls: Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous
Track, and a volume button. It also has a Hold switch, just like the iPod, to
render the controls useless and prevent accidental use. You connect the Apple
Remote (shown in Figure 16-5) to the headphone/line out connection at the top
of the iPod (not the dock). This connection has an outer ring for connecting
remote control devices. The Apple Remote is tethered to the iPod by cable, so
it isn’t as useful in the home as it would be in a car — it has a clip for clipping
the remote control to your shirt.
When your iPod is tethered to a dock and connected to your home stereo,
you don’t have to be within reach to control it remotely — you can control
your iPod with a wireless remote control. For example, Ten Technology
(www.tentechnology.com) offers the stylish $49.95 naviPod that provides
wireless remote control of your iPod with standard Play/Pause, Next Track,
Previous Track, and volume controls. The naviPod uses infrared wireless
technology with a receiver unit that plugs directly into the top of the iPod,
just like the Apple Remote (which we is describe in Chapter 17). The receiver
has FireWire and headphone connections on the bottom, which allow you to
connect your headphones or hook up your iPod to your computer without
removing the naviPod receiver.

Engineered Audio (www.engineeredaudio.com) offers the RemoteRemote
for $34.95. Unlike infrared wireless controls, RemoteRemote is an RF (radio
frequency) wireless remote control that works around corners and through
walls. RemoteRemote offers standard Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track,
and volume controls, and it operates in a range of up to 100 feet.

 Using adapters and mounts to play your iPod in cars
 Using wireless adapters to play your iPod on FM radios
 Protecting your iPod with carrying cases
 Using power accessories on the road
You can truly go anywhere with an iPod. If you can’t plug it into a power
source while it’s playing, you can use the battery for up to eight hours of
playing time before having to recharge. You can find all the accessories that
you need to travel with an iPod in the Apple Store at www.apple.com.
Put on “Eight Miles High” by the Byrds while cruising in a plane at 40,000 feet.
Ride the rails listening to “All Aboard” by Muddy Waters, followed by “Peavine”
by John Lee Hooker. Or cruise on the Autobahn in Germany with Kraftwerk.
Whatever. You have an entire music library with you wherever you go. 
The iPod provides high-quality music no matter what the environment — even
in an earthquake. With skip protection, you don’t have to worry about turbu-
lence, potholes, or strenuous exercise causing the music to skip. In addition
to the hard drive, the 40GB iPod has a 32MB memory cache. The cache is made
up of solid-state memory, with no mechanical or moving parts, so movement
doesn’t affect playback. Skip protection works by preloading up to 20 minutes
of music to the cache at a time. The iPod plays music from the memory cache
rather than the hard drive.

Playing Car Tunes
We always wanted a car that we could fill up with music just as easily as filling
it up with gasoline, without having to carry dozens of cassettes or CDs. With an
iPod, an auto-charger to save on battery power, and a way to connect the iPod
to your car’s stereo system, you’re ready to pump music. (Start your engine
and queue up “Getting in Tune” and then “Going Mobile” by The Who.) Go one
step further and get a new BMW that offers an iPod installed and integrated
into the car’s stereo system so that you can control it from your steering wheel.
Getting in tune . . . with car adapters
While some new vehicles (particularly SUVs) offer 110-volt power outlets 
you can use with your Apple-supplied battery charger, most cars offer only 
a lighter/power socket that requires a power adapter to use with your iPod.
Be careful to pick the right type of power adapter (shown in Figure 17-1) for
your car’s lighter/power socket. The automobile power adapters for older
iPods provide a FireWire connector, but the adapters for the new dockable
iPods use a dock connector cable.

Part III: Playing Tunes 

Belkin (www.belkin.com) offers the Auto Kit for $49.95, and it includes a 
car power adapter with a convenient socket for a stereo mini-plug cable
(which can connect directly to a car stereo if the stereo has a mini-socket 
for audio input). The adapter includes a volume-adjustable amplifier to 
boost the sound coming from the iPod before it goes into the cassette
adapter or car stereo.
Unfortunately, not many car stereos offer a mini-socket for audio input, and
as of this writing, the few accessories that integrate directly with car stereos
require custom car installations. So far, there are no standard dock connec-
tors for car stereos, which would be totally cool because the iPod is clearly
designed for plugging into a “car dock” that offers both power and a connec-
tion to the car’s stereo system.
You can, however, order a professional installation with the Dension ICE-Link
($149 to $239, depending on your car), which adds line-level audio output and
recharging capability to almost any vehicle. It uses the CD-changer connections
in car CD players to directly connect your iPod into the car’s audio system.
Dension (www.dension.com) assumes that the buyer is a professional installer,
and although it’s possible to install it yourself (especially if you use a CD
changer in your trunk), most installations require taking apart the dashboard
and installing the ICE-Link behind your CD stereo. ICE-Link can be combined
with almost any mounting solution for the iPod itself (see the following section,
“Going mobile . . . with car mounts”).
Until you can get a car with a mini-socket for stereo audio input (also called a
stereo-in connection) or a FireWire connection — or get one installed — you
can use a cassette-player adapter to connect with your car stereo or a wire-
less device that we describe later in this chapter, in the section “Connecting
by Wireless Radio.” These solutions provide lower sound quality than custom
installations or stereo-in connections but are inexpensive and work with
most cars.
Many car stereos have a cassette player, and you can buy a cassette-player
adapter from most consumer electronics stores or from the Apple Store
(such as the Sony CPA-9C Car Cassette Adapter). The cassette-player 
adapter, shown previously in Figure 17-1, looks like a tape cassette with a
mini-plug cable (which sticks out through the slot when you’re using the
adapter).
You can connect the mini-plug cable directly to the iPod, to the auto-charger
if a mini-socket is offered, or to the Apple Remote that in turn is connected to
the iPod. Then insert the adapter into the cassette player, being careful not to
get the cable tangled up inside the player.
197
Chapter 17: Listening While on the Move

One inherent problem with this approach is that the cable that dangles from
your cassette player looks unsightly. You also might have some trouble eject-
ing the adapter if the cable gets wedged in the door, but overall, this method
is the best for most cars because it provides the best sound quality.
The Apple Remote, which is supplied with some models and optional with
others, is more useful in a car than almost anywhere else — it provides the
usual CD player controls: Play/Pause, Next Track, Previous Track, and a volume
button (see Chapter 16), so you can pause a song, skip to the next or previous
song, or adjust the volume without having to reach over to your iPod while
driving. You can attach the Apple Remote to your shirt or the edge of some-
thing thin, such as an air-conditioner vent in your dashboard.
Going mobile . . . with car mounts
Unless you have one of the new BMW models that are iPod-ready, or opt for 
a custom installation of some kind involving your car stereo and car power
(such as using a custom cable interface for a CD changer, which can be installed
into your dashboard by a skilled car audio specialist), you have at best a
clumsy solution that uses one cable (power) from a power adapter to the
iPod, and another cable (audio) to your car stereo cassette adapter, audio
input, or wireless adapter. Attached to these wires, your iPod needs a secure
place to sit while your car moves — you don’t want it bouncing around on
the passenger seat.
You can fit your iPod securely in position in a car without getting a custom
installation. The TuneDok ($29.95) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) holds 
your iPod securely and fits into your car’s cup-holder (see Figure 17-2). The
TuneDok’s ratcheting neck and height-adjustment feature lets you reposition
the iPod to your liking. The cable-management clip eliminates loose and tan-
gled cables, and the large and small rubber base and cup fits most cup holders.
MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers an inexpensive solution for both car use
and personal use. The $5.95 Car Holder, available when you select a MARWARE
SportSuit case, attaches to the dashboard of your car, as shown in Figure 17-3,
and lets you attach an iPod that’s wearing one of the MARWARE SportSuit cov-
ering cases (see “Dressing Up Your iPod for Travel” in this chapter). The clip
on the back attaches to the Car Holder.
ProClip (www.proclipusa.com) offers mounting brackets for clip-on devices.
The brackets attach to the dashboard and can be installed in seconds. After
you install the bracket, you can use different custom holders for the iPod
models or for cell phones and other portable devices.

Connecting by Wireless Radio
A wireless music adapter lets you play music from your iPod on an FM radio,
with no connection or cable, although the sound quality might suffer a bit
due to interference. We always take a wireless adapter with us whenever we

Chapter 17: Listening While on the Move

rent a car — even if a rental car has no cassette deck (ruling out the use of
our cassette adapter), the car probably has an FM radio.
You can use a wireless adapter in a car, on a boat, on the beach with a portable
radio, or even in your home with a stereo system and tuner. We even use it in
hotel rooms with a clock radio.
To use a wireless adapter, follow these steps:
1. Set the wireless adapter to an FM radio frequency.
The adapter offers you a choice of several frequencies — typically 88.1,
88.3, 88.5, and 88.7 MHz. You choose the frequency and set the adapter
according to its instructions.
2. Connect the wireless adapter to the iPod headphone/line-out connec-
tor or to the line-out connector on the iPod dock.
The wireless adapter (see Figure 17-4) acts like a miniature radio station,
broadcasting to a nearby FM radio. (Sorry, you can’t go much farther than
a few feet, so no one else can hear your Wolfman Jack impersonation.)
3. Tune to the appropriate frequency on the FM dial. 
Tune any nearby radio to the same FM frequency that you chose in Step 1.
You need to set the adapter close enough to the radio’s antenna to work,
making it impractical for home stereos — you can get better quality sound 
by connecting to a home stereo with a cable.
Don’t be surprised if the wireless adapter doesn’t work as well in cities —
other radio stations might cause too much interference.

Part III: Playing Tunes 

Here are just a few wireless adapters that we recommend:
 For $29.99, the irock 400FM Wireless Music Adapter (www.myirock.com)
from First International Digital requires standard replaceable batteries
and offers a car power adapter.
 The TuneCast II Mobile FM Transmitter ($49.99) from Belkin (www.
belkin.com) is particularly convenient in a car because it includes 
a 14-inch cable that delivers power when used with the Belkin Mobile
Power Cord for iPod, so that you can preserve your batteries for times
when you’re away from an alternate source. It offers four programmable
memory slots for saving the clearest radio frequency wherever you go.
 The TransPod FM ($99) from Digital Lifestyle Outfitters, available from
Everything iPod (www.everythingipod.com), is an excellent all-in-one
wireless FM transmitter, mounting system, and power adapter for using
your iPod in a car, and it costs less than purchasing all three items 
separately.
Dressing Up Your iPod for Travel
The simple protective carrying case supplied with some iPod models is just
not as stylin’ as the myriad accessories that you can get for dressing up your
iPod for travel. You can find different types of protective gear, from leather
jackets to aluminum cases, in many different styles and colors. Some are
designed primarily for protecting your iPod from harm; others are designed to
provide some measure of protection while also providing access to controls.
On the extreme end of the spectrum are hardened cases that are ready for
battlefields in deserts or jungles — the Humvees of iPod protective gear. The
iPod Armor ($49.95) by Matias Corporation (www.ipodarmor.com) is a sturdy
case that fits all models of iPod and offers possibly the best protection against
physical trauma on the market. Your iPod rests within a hard, resilient metal
exoskeleton that can withstand the abuse of bouncing down a flight of metal
stairs without letting your iPod pop out. Of course, the very same feature that
prevents your iPod from popping out also makes the iPod Armor difficult to
open to get access to it — this is not a case to use while listening to music.
Business travelers can combine personal items into one carrying case. The
iPod Leather Organizer from Belkin is made from fine-grain leather that even
Ricardo Montalban would rave about. The case holds personal essentials,
like business and credit cards, in four convenient slots. A handy mesh pocket
keeps earphones easily accessible, and a billfold holds money and receipts. 
201
Chapter 17: Listening While on the Move

On the sporty side, MARWARE (www.marware.com) offers the SportSuit
Convertible case ($39.95) with a patented belt clip system offering interchange-
able clip options for use with the MARWARE Car Holder or with an armband or
belt for jogging or working out. The neoprene case has vulcanized rubber grips
on each side and bottom for a no-slip grip and plastic inserts for impact pro-
tection, offering full access to all iPod controls and connections while the iPod
is in the case. There’s even space inside the lid to store earbud headphones. 
If you like to carry a backpack with everything in it, consider the very first back-
pack ever designed to control an iPod within it: The Amp Pack ($199.95) from
Burton (www.burton.com/Burton/gear/products.asp?productID=731)
lets you switch songs on your iPod by pressing a button on the shoulder strap.
Constructed from ballistic nylon, the Amp Pack offers a secure iPod storage
pocket, a headphone port located on a shoulder strap, an easy-access side
entry laptop compartment, and padded ergonomic shoulder straps with a
soft, flexible control pad built into a strap. Perfect for listening to Lou Reed
while hanging onto a pole in a subway car, or the Hollies while navigating
your way to the back of the bus.
Using Power Accessories
If you want to charge your iPod battery when you travel abroad, you can’t
count on finding the same voltage as in your home country. However, you
still need to plug your Apple power adapter into something to recharge your
iPod. Fortunately, power adapters are available in most airports, but the
worldly traveler might want to consider saving time and money by getting a
travel kit of power accessories.
We found several varieties of power kits for world travel in our local interna-
tional airport. Most kits include a set of AC plugs with prongs that fit different
electrical outlets around the world. You can connect your iPod power adapter
to these adapters. The AC plugs typically support outlets in North America,
Japan, China, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Korea, Australia, and
Hong Kong.
One way to mitigate the battery blues is to get an accessory that lets you use
replaceable alkaline batteries — the kind that you can find in any convenience
store. The Backup Battery Pack ($59.95) from Belkin (www.belkin.com) lets
you power your iPod with four standard AA alkaline replaceable batteries —
even when your internal iPod battery is drained. Discreet suction cups secure
the unit to the back of your iPod without marring your iPod finish. A charge-
level indicator tells you when your batteries are running low.
202
Part III: Playing Tunes 

Another way to supply power to your iPod is to use your FireWire-equipped
laptop to supply the power (make sure that you use FireWire hardware that
provides power — see Chapter 1), and then use a power adapter with your
laptop. You can use, for example, the Kensington Universal Car/Air Adapter
from Apple to plug a Mac PowerBook or iBook into any car cigarette lighter
or EmPower-equipped airline seat (the EmPower in-seat power system can
provide either 110-volt AC or 15-volt DC power in an aircraft seat for passen-
ger use). Then connect the iPod to the laptop with a FireWire cable.
If you fly often, the APC Travel Power ($79), available from the Apple Store,
might be just the ticket. It includes an adapter that plugs into an airline seat
power connection, as well as a car power adapter. The unit offers 75 watts of
continuous power with built-in circuit protection. The flight attendant will still
tell you to turn off your iPod before takeoff and landing, but you won’t waste
precious battery power during the flight.

f you like to entertain folks by spinning tunes at home or at parties, iTunes
could easily become your DJ console. You could set up a laptop that con-
nects to a home stereo and connect the iPods that your friends bring over to
augment your iTunes library. Imagine how much music you could choose from
by connecting several 40GB iPods to an iTunes library that already holds thou-
sands of songs!
Your computer is a mean multimedia machine with the ability to mix sounds
from different sources and play them through built-in speakers, external speak-
ers, or headphones. Macs and PCs can play audio CDs, DVDs, and digital video
files as well as iTunes music.
This chapter describes how you can play your iPod music on your computer,
through your computer’s speakers. It also shows how you can use a wireless
connection with AirPort Express and AirTunes to transmit music to your home
stereo or speakers without any wires. You could stroll through the party with
your laptop, choosing songs, taking requests, and beaming the music directly
to your stereo system.

Changing the Computer’s Output Volume
You can control the volume and other characteristics of the sound coming out
of your computer’s speakers, headphones, or external speakers. Even if you
connect your computer to a stereo amplifier with its own volume and equalizer
controls, it’s best to get the volume right at the source — your computer and
iTunes — and then adjust the output volume as you please on your stereo or
external speaker unit.
Volume is controlled by the computer system’s audio controls. iTunes also
controls the volume, but that control is within the range of the computer’s
volume setting. For example, if you set your computer’s volume to half and set
iTunes volume to full, you get half volume because the computer is limiting
the volume to half. If you set your computer volume at half and also reduce
the iTunes volume to half, you actually get one-quarter volume — half the
computer’ setting. The sound can be further adjusted after it leaves your
computer by using the stereo system or external speakers with controls.
The appropriate volume depends entirely on your preferences for hearing
music, but in general, the maximum level of output from your computer is
preferable when connecting to a stereo system or speakers with volume 
controls. After setting your computer to the maximum volume, adjust the
iTunes volume or your stereo or speaker volume (or both) to get the best
sound. When using the computer’s speakers or headphones, the computer’s
volume and the iTunes volume are the only volume controls that you have,
so after adjusting the volume on your computer to the maximum level 
(or lower if you prefer), adjust the iTunes volume.
Adjusting the sound on a Mac
The Mac was built for sound from the very start. Making and playing music
has been part of the Mac culture since day one, when Steve Jobs introduced
the original Mac to an audience with music coming from its small speaker. 
(It played simple tones, but it was the first personal computer with built-in
sound.) 
Today’s Mac comes with built-in or external speakers and at least one 
headphone/line-out connection that you can use to connect external 
speakers or a stereo system. Mac OS X lets you configure output speakers
and control levels for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.
If you use external speakers, headphones, or a stereo system, make sure that
you connect these devices properly before adjusting the volume. To adjust the
volume on your Mac, follow these steps:
206
Part III: Playing Tunes 

1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock, and
then click the Sound icon.
You can have iTunes open and playing music while you do this.
2. In the Sound preferences window, click Output.
If you have headphones attached, a Headphones option appears in the
list of sound output devices; if not, an External Speakers option appears,
as shown in Figure 18-1. If you have external speakers and a pair of head-
phones attached to your Mac, the external speakers disappear from the
Sound preferences, but they’re still enabled.
3. Adjust the volume by dragging the Output Volume slider.
You can drag the slider to adjust the volume as you listen to music. You
also have a Mute button in this window — click the Mute check box to
silence your Mac. You can also adjust the stereo balance by dragging the
Balance slider to put more music in the left or right channels.
4. Close the Preferences window by choosing System Preferences➪Quit
System Preferences or by clicking the red button in the upper-left
corner of the window.
The Sound preferences window isn’t like a dialog — when you change
settings, you can hear the effect immediately without having to click an
OK button. (There isn’t an OK button, anyway.)

Adjusting the sound in Windows
Windows XP and Windows 2000 let you configure output speakers and con-
trol levels for stereo speakers and multichannel audio devices.
Use the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog to change the volume.
To open this window, choose Start➪Control Panel, and click the Sounds and
Audio Devices icon. Then click the Volume tab.
As shown in Figure 18-2, the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog offers
the Device volume slider — drag this slider to set the volume. You can also
silence your PC by selecting the Mute check box.
If you select the Place Volume Icon in the Taskbar option, and your sound
card supports changing the volume with software, a speaker icon appears in
the notification area of Windows. You can then change the volume quickly
without having to open the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties dialog —
simply click the speaker icon and drag the slider that pops up. For more
information about adjusting sound on a PC, see PCs For Dummies, 9th Edition
by Dan Gookin (Wiley).
Mixing It Up with iTunes
You can choose songs to play manually, but iTunes also provides several auto-
mated features so that you can spend less time prepping your music selection
and more time enjoying it.

Queuing up tunes with Party Shuffle
Playlists are great for organizing music in the order that you want to play it,
but you can have iTunes serve up songs at random by using Party Shuffle. It’s
not a dance step or pub game — Party Shuffle is a dynamic playlist that auto-
matically generates a semi-random selection in a list that you can modify on
the fly. With Party Shuffle at work, you might even find songs in your library
you forgot about or rarely play — Party Shuffle always throws a few rarely
played songs into the mix. 
To use Party Shuffle, follow these steps:
1. Click Party Shuffle in the Source pane. 
The Song List pane and Browse pane are replaced with the Party Shuffle
track list and settings at the bottom, as shown in Figure 18-3.
2. Select a source from the Source pop-up menu below the Party Shuffle
track list.
You can select the entire library or any playlist (including smart playlists)
as the source for music in the Party Shuffle. If you select a playlist, Party
Shuffle limits its choices to songs from that playlist.
3. Set the following options: 
• Recently played songs: Choose how many songs should remain in
the list after they are played. You can drag already-played songs
(even though they are grayed out after playing) to a spot later in
the list to play them again.

• Upcoming songs: Choose how many songs should be listed as
upcoming (not yet played). By displaying upcoming songs first,
you can decide whether to rearrange the list or delete songs 
before they are played.
• Play higher rated songs more often: Turn on this option to have
iTunes add more high-rated songs to the random list. Using this
option, you weight the randomness in favor of higher-rated songs.
See Chapter 9 to learn how to add ratings to songs.
4. (Optional) If you don’t like the order of songs, you can rearrange it;
any songs you don’t like you can eliminate.
You can rearrange the order of songs in the Party Shuffle by dragging
songs to different positions in the Party Shuffle list. Eliminate songs by
selecting them in the Party Shuffle list and pressing Delete (or choosing
Edit➪Clear).
5. Play the Party Shuffle by selecting the first song and clicking the Play
button or pressing the Space bar.
You can start playing from the first song or from any song on the list.
(When you pick a song in the middle to start playing, the songs before
it are grayed out to show that they won’t play.)
6. Add, delete, or rearrange songs even while the Party Shuffle plays.
While the Party Shuffle list plays, you can add songs in one of two ways:
• Open the Party Shuffle in a separate window by double-clicking 
the Party Shuffle item in the Source pane. You can then drag songs
from the main iTunes window — either from the Library or from a
playlist — directly into position in the Party Shuffle track list.
• Without opening Party Shuffle in a separate window, you can switch
to the library or a playlist, and drag the song to the Party Shuffle
item in the Source pane, just like dragging a song to a playlist. When
you add a song to the Party Shuffle, it shows up at the end of the
track list. You can then drag it to a new position.
You can add one or more albums to the Party Shuffle track list by dragging
the albums; the songs play in album order. You can also add all the songs by
an artist by dragging the artist name. Party Shuffle acts just like a playlist,
except dynamically — you add, delete, and change the order of songs on
the fly.
Cool DJs mix the Party Shuffle window with other open playlist windows —
just double-click the playlist item in the Source pane to open it in a separate
window. You can then drag songs from different playlist windows to the Party
Shuffle window while the Party Shuffle plays, adding songs in whatever order
you want in real time.

Cross-fading song playback
You can often hear a song on the radio fade out as another song immediately
fades in right over the first song’s ending. This is a cross-fade, and with iTunes,
you can smoothly transition from the ending of a song to the beginning of the
next one. Ordinarily, iTunes is set to have a short cross-fade of one second —
the amount of time between the end of the fade in the first song and the start
of the fade in the second song.
What’s totally cool about this is that you can cross-fade between two songs 
in iTunes even if they’re from different sources — the songs could be in your
library, in a shared library, on CD or DVD, or even on one (or more!) iPods
connected to your computer and playing through iTunes (as we describe in
“Playing an iPod through iTunes,” later in this chapter). You could play DJ at
a party with a massive music library on a laptop and still augment that library
with one or more iPods and any number of CDs, and the songs cross-fade to
the next just like on the radio or at a dance party with a professional DJ.
You can change the amount of the cross-fade by choosing iTunes➪Preferences
and then clicking the Audio button. The Audio dialog appears, as shown in
Figure 18-4.
In the Audio dialog, you select the Crossfade Playback option, and then
increase or decrease the amount of the cross-fade by dragging the slider.
Each notch in the slider is one second. The maximum amount of cross-fade
is 12 seconds. With a longer cross-fade you get a longer overlap from one
song to the next — the second song starts before the first one ends. To turn
off the cross-fade, deselect the check box.

Playing an iPod through iTunes
You can’t copy the songs from your iPod into your iTunes library using iTunes,
but you can use iTunes on your computer to play the songs directly from the
iPod. You can even bring your friend’s iPod with you to a party, along with
your laptop running iTunes, and include your friend’s iPod songs in your Party
Shuffle — include anyone’s iPod songs in your Party Shuffle. Not only can you
do that, but as you play songs from different iPods or from your library, you
can cross-fade them, as we describe previously in “Cross-fading song playback,”
in this chapter.
When you set your iPod to manually update and connect the iPod to your
computer, the iPod name appears in the iTunes Source pane, and when you
select it, the iPod’s songs appear in the iTunes window. You can connect
someone else’s iPod this way, as we describe in the following section,
“Connecting your iPod to another computer.”
To play music on your iPod in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer, holding down Ô-Option on a Mac,
or Ctrl-Alt on a PC, to prevent automatic updating.
2. Set the iPod to update manually.
To set the iPod to update manually, see Chapter 11. (The iPod updates
automatically by default, but you can change that.)
3. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source pane, the list of songs on the
iPod appears, as shown in Figure 18-5. You can scroll or browse the iPod’s
library just like the main iTunes library (as we describe in Chapter 8).
Click the Browse button to browse the iPod’s contents.
4. (Optional) View the iPod playlists.
After selecting the iPod in the iTunes Source pane, you can click the tri-
angle next to its name to view the iPod’s playlists.
5. Click a song in the iPod song list, and then click the iTunes Play
button.
When an iPod song is playing in iTunes, it’s just like playing a song from the
iTunes library or a track on a CD. The Status pane above the list of songs tells
you the name of the artist and song (if known) and the elapsed time.

Connecting your iPod to another computer
The previous section shows you how to connect your iPod to your computer.
What if you want to connect your iPod to a computer other than your own?
Or what if a friend arrives with an iPod filled with songs that you’d like to hear,
and you want to hear them on your stereo system that’s already connected to
your computer?
You can connect your iPod to another computer, or connect someone else’s
iPod to your computer. Either way, iTunes starts up and recognizes that 
the iPod is not matched to the iTunes library (because it is matched to some
other computer’s iTunes library). iTunes displays a message asking whether
you want to change the link to this iTunes music library and replace all exist-
ing songs and playlists. This is important: click No.
Unless you want to change the contents of your iPod to reflect this com-
puter’s music library, don’t click Yes. If you click the Yes button, iTunes erases
the music library of your iPod and then updates your iPod with the library on
this computer. If you’re using a public computer with no music in its iTunes
library, you end up with an empty iPod. If you’re using a friend’s computer,
your friend’s library copies to your iPod, erasing whatever was on your iPod.
So don’t click Yes unless you really want to completely change the music on
your iPod. You’ve been warned.

Chapter 18: Spinning Tunes Like a DJ

After clicking No, the iPod appears in the iTunes Source pane. Set the iPod to
update manually (see Chapter 11) to play songs from your iPod.
You can use a Windows-formatted iPod with a Mac, but you can’t use a Mac-
formatted iPod with Windows. When you install an iPod with Windows, the
iPod is formatted for Windows; but you are still in luck with a Mac because
Macs can read Windows drives. If you want to be a laptop DJ and use other
people’s iPods in the mix, use a Mac laptop because it can access both types
of iPods.
If you connected a Mac-formatted iPod to a Windows computer, you get a
warning message about reformatting it. Don’t do it! Click Cancel — otherwise,
you reformat the iPod and clear all music from it. Then click the Safely Remove
Hardware icon on the Windows taskbar to open the Safely Remove Hardware
window. Select the iPod and click Stop. Wait for the list of devices in the Safely
Remove Hardware window to be cleared. Then wait for your iPod to display a
message that it’s okay to disconnect (or until the iPod main menu appears).
You can then disconnect the iPod.
Using AirTunes for wireless 
stereo playback
You want to play the music in your iTunes library (or on your iPod connected
to your computer), but your stereo system is in another room, and you don’t
want wires going from one room to the other. What you need is an AirPort in
your home — specifically, AirPort Express with AirTunes, which lets you play
your iTunes music through your stereo or powered speakers in virtually any
room of your house, without wires as it’s within range of the AirPort Express
Base Station.
AirPort is Apple’s technology that provides Wi-Fi wireless networking for any
AirPort-equipped Mac or PC that uses a Wi-Fi-certified IEEE 802.11b or 802.11g
wireless card or offers built-in Wi-Fi. For more about AirPort, see Mac OS X
Panther All-in-One Desk Reference For Dummies by Mark L. Chambers (Wiley). 
AirPort Express uses the fast 802.11g wireless standard to deliver data rates
up to 54 Mbps. It also works with the 802.11b wireless protocol, so that Macs
and PCs with older Wi-Fi configurations can connect wirelessly.
To use a stereo system or powered speakers with AirTunes, connect the
system or speakers to the audio port on the AirPort Express Base Station.
iTunes automatically detects the connection. When you open iTunes on your
214
Part III: Playing Tunes 

AirPort-equipped Mac or Wi-Fi-compliant PC, a pop-up menu appears in the
lower-right corner of the iTunes window, showing your remote speakers. You
can select the remote speakers or stereo system to play music.
If you already have a wireless network in place, you can add AirPort Express
and AirTunes without changing anything. Connect the AirPort Express Base
Station to the stereo system or powered speakers, and plug the Base Station
into an electrical outlet. The AirPort Express Base Station wirelessly links to
your existing wireless network without requiring any change to the network.
You can use several AirPort Express Base Stations — one for each stereo
system or set of powered speakers, in different rooms — and then choose
which stereo/speaker system to use in the pop-up menu.
To use AirTunes and the AirPort Express Base Station, follow these steps:
1. Install the software supplied on CD-ROM, which includes support for
AirTunes.
2. Connect your stereo or a set of powered speakers to the audio port of
the AirPort Express Base Station.
You can use an optical digital or analog audio cable. (Both are included in
the AirPort Express Stereo Connection Kit.) Which cable you use depends
on whether your stereo or set of powered speakers has an optical digital
or analog connection.
3. Plug the AirPort Express Base Station into an electrical outlet.
Use the AC plug that came with the Base Station or the AirPort Express
power extension cord included in the AirPort Express Stereo Connection
Kit. The Base Station turns on automatically when connected to an elec-
trical outlet. (The Base Station doesn’t require a switch). The status light
glows yellow while AirPort Express is starting up. When it starts up com-
pletely, the light turns green.
4. On your computer, use the AirPort Express Assistant to set up iTunes.
The assistant detects the Base Station and walks you through the
process of setting it up with iTunes.
The AirPort Express Base Station is small enough to fit in the palm of your
hand — and it travels well because all it needs is a power outlet. You can take
your laptop and AirPort Express to a friend’s house or a party, connect the
Base Station to the stereo system, and then use your laptop anywhere in its
vicinity to play DJ. You can even use portable powered speakers wirelessly in
a hotel room.

Playing iPod Songs through 
MusicMatch Jukebox
If you don’t have the proper configuration to run the Windows version of
iTunes, or you want to use MusicMatch Jukebox for other reasons (such as
the encoders supplied with it), you can play your iPod’s music directly on
your Windows PC by using MusicMatch Jukebox. Normally, when you con-
nect your iPod to a Windows-based PC by using MusicMatch Jukebox, the
program starts up and displays the iPod in its PortablesPlus window. When
you play an iPod song in MusicMatch Jukebox, it’s similar to playing a song in
the library or a track on a CD — you have the same flexibility with playback.
To play songs in MusicMatch Jukebox, first drag the selected songs from the
iPod library in the PortablesPlus window to the MusicMatch Jukebox playlist
window, which we cover in Chapter 7. The order of songs in the playlist is
based on the order in which you selected them and dragged them to the list.
To play songs in the playlist, click the name of the song in the playlist
window, and then click the Play button. When the song finishes, MusicMatch
Jukebox continues playing the songs in the playlist in sequence until you click
the Pause or Stop button. You can control song playback with MusicMatch
Jukebox’s Play, Stop, Pause, Next, and Previous buttons. The status area near
the control buttons tells you the name of the artist and song (if known) and
the elapsed time.
To rearrange songs in the playlist window, you can click and drag a song from
one slot in the list to another. You can use the Repeat button to repeat the
songs in a playlist, and use the Shuffle button to shuffle song playback in
random order.

 Choosing the appropriate encoder and import settings
A
s you discover more about digital audio technology, you find that 
you have more decisions to make about your music library than you
previously thought, and this chapter helps you make them. For example, 
you might be tempted to trade quality for space — import music at average-
quality settings that allow you to put more songs on your hard drive and iPod
than if you chose higher-quality settings. This might make you happy today,
but what about tomorrow, when iPods and hard drives double or triple in
capacity?
On the other hand, you might be very picky about the sound quality, and with
an eye toward future generations of iPods and cheap hard drives, you might
decide to trade space for quality, importing music at the highest possible qual-
ity settings and then converting copies to lower-quality, space-saving versions
for iPods and other uses. Of course, you need more hard drive space to accom-
modate the higher-quality versions.
This chapter explains which music encoding and compression formats to use
for higher quality and which to use for cramming more songs into your hard
drive space.

Trading Quality for Space
The encoding format and settings that you choose for importing music when
ripping a CD affect sound quality, iPod space, and hard drive space on your
computer. The format and settings might also affect the music files’ ability to
play on other types of players and computers.
The audio compression methods that are good at reducing space have to
throw away information. In technospeak, these methods are known as lossy
(as opposed to lossless) compression algorithms. For example, the AAC and
MP3 encoding formats compress the sound using lossy methods — the com-
pression algorithms reduce the sound quality by throwing away information to
make the file smaller, so you lose information and some quality in the process.
On the other hand, the Apple Lossless encoder compresses the sound without
any loss in quality or information, but the resulting file is only a bit smaller
than the uncompressed version — the main reason to use Apple Lossless is
to maintain quality for burning CDs while also playing the songs on iPods.
The AIFF and WAV encoders do not compress the sound and are the best
choices for burning CDs.
With lossy compression using MP3 or AAC, the amount of compression
depends on the bit rate that you choose, as well as the encoding format and
other options. The bit rate determines how many bits (of digital music infor-
mation) can travel during playback in a given second. Measured in kilobits
per second (Kbps), a higher bit rate, such as 320KB, offers higher quality
than a bit rate of 192KB because the sound is not compressed as much —
which means the resulting sound file is larger and takes up more iPod and
hard drive space.
Using more compression (a lower bit rate) means that the files are smaller,
and the sound quality is poorer. Using less compression (a higher bit rate)
means that the sound is higher in quality, but the files are larger. You can
trade quality for space and have more music of lower quality, or trade space
for quality and have less music of higher quality.
Also, power is an issue with the iPod. Playing larger files takes more power
because the hard drive inside the iPod has to refresh its memory buffers
more frequently to process information as the song plays — you might even
hear hiccups in the sound.
We prefer a higher-quality sound overall, and we typically don’t use the lower-
quality settings for encoders except for voice recordings and music recorded
before 1960 (which is already low in quality, so you don’t hear that much of a
difference when compressed). We can hear differences in music quality at the
higher compression levels, and we prefer going out and buying another hard
drive to store more music if necessary.
220
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Choosing an Encoder
Your iPod’s music software gives you a choice of encoders. This is perhaps
the most important choice to make before starting to rip music CDs and
build up your library. iTunes and MusicMatch Jukebox offer the same
encoders — with some differences. Here we leapfrog years of technospeak
about digital music file formats and get right to the ones that you need to
know about.
iTunes encoders
Choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a Mac, or the Edit menu on a
Windows PC) and click the Importing tab to see the Importing Preferences
dialog. You can choose one of five encoders from the Import Using pop-up
menu:
 AAC Encoder: All your purchased music from the iTunes Music store
comes in this format. We recommend it for all uses except when ripping
your own CDs to burn new audio CDs. Technically known as MPEG-4
Advanced Audio Coding, AAC is a higher quality format than MP3 at the
same bit rate — meaning that AAC at 128 Kbps is higher quality than MP3
at 128 Kbps. (MPEG stands for Moving Picture Experts Group, a committee
that recognizes compression standards for video and audio.) We think it
offers the best tradeoff of space and quality for iPod users. It’s suitable
(though not as good as AIFF or Apple Lossless) for burning to an audio
CD, and it’s also excellent for playing on an iPod or from a hard drive.
However, as of this writing, only Apple supports AAC.
 Apple Lossless Encoder: The Apple Lossless encoder is a compromise
between the lower-quality encoding of AAC or MP3 (which results in
lower file sizes) and the large file sizes of uncompressed, high-quality
AIFF or WAV audio. The Apple Lossless encoder provides CD quality
sound in a file size that’s about 60 to 70 percent of the size of an AIFF 
or WAV encoded file. The virtue of this encoder is that you can use it 
for songs that you intend to burn onto audio CDs and for playing on
iPods — the files are just small enough that they don’t hiccup on play-
back, but are still much larger than their MP3 or AAC counterparts.
Using the Apple Lossless encoder is the most efficient method of storing
the highest-quality versions of your songs. You can burn the songs to CDs
without any quality loss and still play them on your iPod. You can’t store
as many songs on your iPod as with AAC or MP3, but the songs that you
do store have the highest-possible quality.
221
Chapter 19: Choosing Your Encoding Format

 AIFF Encoder: The Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF) is the standard
digital format for uncompressed sound on a Mac, and it provides the high-
est quality digital representation of the sound. Like the WAV encoder for
Windows, the AIFF encoder uses a Mac-specific version of the original
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) algorithm required for compliance with
audio CDs. Use AIFF if you plan to burn songs onto an audio CD or to edit
the songs with a digital sound-editing program. Mac-based sound-editing
programs import and export AIFF files, and you can edit and save in AIFF
format repeatedly with absolutely no loss in quality. The downside is
that AIFF files take up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod space
because they’re uncompressed. Don’t use AIFF for songs that you want
to play on an iPod — use the Apple Lossless encoder instead.
 MP3 Encoder: The MPEG-1, Layer 3 format, also known as MP3, is sup-
ported by most computers and some CD players. Use the MP3 format for
songs that you intend to use with other MP3 players besides your iPod
(which also plays MP3 songs, obviously), or use with applications that
support MP3, or to burn on an MP3 CD. (AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless
formats are better for regular audio CDs.) The MP3 format offers quite 
a lot of different compression and quality settings, so you can fine-tune
the format to get better quality, sacrificing hard drive (and iPod) space
as you dial up the quality. Use the MP3 format for a song that you intend
to use with MP3 players, MP3 CDs, and applications that support MP3.
 WAV Encoder: Waveform Audio File Format (WAV) is a digital audio stan-
dard that Windows PCs can understand and manipulate. Like AIFF, WAV
is uncompressed and provides the highest quality digital representation
of the sound. Like the AIFF encoder for the Mac, the WAV encoder uses
a Windows-specific version of the original Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
algorithm required for compliance with audio CDs. Use WAV if you plan on
burning the song to an audio CD or using the song with Windows-based
digital sound-editing programs, which import and export WAV files (there
is no difference between AIFF and WAV except that AIFF works with Mac
applications and WAV works with Windows applications). WAV files take
up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod space because they’re
uncompressed. Don’t use WAV for songs that you want to play on an
iPod — use the Apple Lossless encoder instead.
If you want to share your music with someone who uses an MP3 player other
than an iPod, you can import or convert songs with the MP3 encoder. As an
iPod user, you can use the higher-quality AAC encoder to produce files that
are either the same size as their MP3 counterparts but higher in quality, or at
the same quality but smaller in size.
222
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

To have the best possible quality that you can get for future growth, 
and for music editing, consider not using compression at all (as with AIFF 
or WAV), or using Apple Lossless. You can import music at the highest 
possible quality — by using the AIFF or WAV encoders or the Apple Lossless
encoder — and burn them to audio CDs; then convert the music files to a
lesser-quality format for use in the iPod or other devices. If you use Apple
Lossless for songs, you can use those songs on an iPod, but they take up
much more space than AAC- or MP3-encoded songs. We describe how to 
convert music in Chapter 20.
MusicMatch Jukebox encoders
MusicMatch Jukebox offers several options for fine-tuning the CD-ripping
process. When you first use the program, the MP3 recording format is
selected by default, offering various quality options, which we describe 
in Chapter 20. You can change the recording format (properly known as 
the encoder) to mp3PRO, WAV, Windows Media, and other encoder formats
that are associated with third-party plug-in software for MusicMatch 
Jukebox.
You have two basic choices for encoding formats in MusicMatch Jukebox 
that work with your iPod: MP3 (and its variations), and WAV. MP3 (or a 
variation such as mp3PRO) is the encoder to choose for songs to use on 
your iPod. 
The WAV encoder, although it provides the highest quality sound, doesn’t
compress the audio, and is therefore not as useful for iPods. WAV is a 
digital audio standard for Windows-based PCs. Use WAV if you plan on 
burning the song to an audio CD or on using the song with PC-based digital
sound-editing programs, which import and export WAV files. WAV files 
take up enormous amounts of hard drive and iPod space because they’re
uncompressed.
The mp3PRO encoder that’s provided with MusicMatch Jukebox creates 
an MP3 file, only smaller. Use the mp3PRO encoder for even greater file 
compression than with the standard MP3 encoder. People typically use the
mp3PRO encoder for songs that don’t require extreme high-fidelity playback,
because mp3PRO compresses files even further and allows more songs to fit
on your iPod.
223
Chapter 19: Choosing Your Encoding Format

If you want to get the benefits of different formats, you can import a CD with
one encoder, such as WAV, and then either import the CD again with a differ-
ent encoder, such as MP3, or convert the music files to a lesser-quality format
for use on the iPod or other devices. We describe how to convert music files
in Chapter 20.
Although MusicMatch Jukebox lets you convert MP3 to WAV, or an MP3 at a
lower bit rate to an MP3 with a higher bit rate, neither conversion improves
song quality. You might have a reason for converting MP3 to WAV, but the song’s
quality remains exactly the same while taking up lots more space. The same
is true about converting MP3s from a lower bit rate to a higher bit rate — the
song remains at the same quality level but takes up more hard drive space.
The most useful conversion is from WAV (the format used for burning CDs) to
MP3 (the format used on the Web and iPod); this conversion slightly reduces
the quality of the song, but shrinks the file size exponentially so that more
songs can fit on your iPod.
224
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 
The past, present, and future of music
Our suggestions for encoders and importing pref-
erences for ripping CDs are based on our own
listening experiences and our preference of the
highest quality and the best use of compression
technology. You might be quite happy with the
results of using these suggestions, but listening
pleasure depends entirely on you and the way the
song itself was recorded. Some people can hear
qualitative differences that others don’t hear or
don’t care about. Some people can also tolerate
a lower-quality sound in exchange for the conve-
nience of carrying more music on their iPods. And
sometimes the recording is so primitive-sounding
that you can get away with using lower-quality
settings to gain more hard drive space.
Just a century ago, people gathered at phonog-
raphy partiesto rent a headset and listen to a new
invention called a phonograph, the predecessor
to the record player. Before records, radio, and
jukeboxes, these parties and live performances
were the only sources of music, and the quality
of the sound must have been crude by today’s
standards, but still quite enjoyable.
The choices of formats for sound have changed
considerably from the fragile 78 rpm records from
the phonography parties of the early 1900s and the
scratchy 45 rpm and 33 rpm records of the 1940s
through the 1980s to today’s CDs. Consumers had
to be on the alert then, as you do now, for dead-
end formats that could lock up music in a cul-de-
sac of technology, never to be played again. You
know what we’re talking about — dead-end for-
mats, such as the ill-fated 8-track cartridge or the
legendary quadraphonic LP. You want your digital
music to last forever and play at high quality —
not get stuck with technology that doesn’t evolve
with the times.
Digital music has evolved beyond the commercial
audio CD, and computers haven’t yet caught up
to some of the latest audio formats. For example,
iTunes can’t yet import sound from these formats:

225
Chapter 19: Choosing Your Encoding Format
 DVD-audio:DVD-audio is a relatively new dig-
ital audio format developed from the format
for DVD video. DVD-audio is based on PCM
recording technology but offers improved
sound quality by using a higher sampling fre-
quency and longer word lengths. Neither
iTunes nor MusicMatch Jukebox support the
DVD-audio format, but you can import a dig-
ital video file containing DVD-audio sound
into iMovie, extract the sound, and export the
sound in AIFF or WAV format, which you can
use with iTunes. You can also use Toast with
Jam 6 from Roxio (www.roxio.com) to
import and burn DVD-audio.
 Super Audio CD (SACD): Super Audio CD is
a new format developed from the past audio
format for CDs. The SACD format is based on
Direct Stream Digital (DSD) recording tech-
nology that closely reproduces the shape of
the original analog waveforms to produce a
more natural, higher quality sound. Originally
developed for the digital archiving of priceless
analog masters tapes, DSD is based on 1-bit
sigma-delta modulation, and operates with a
sampling frequency of 2.8224 MHz (64 times
the 44.1 kHz used in audio CDs). Philips and
Sony adopted DSD as the basis for SACD, and
the format is growing in popularity among
audiophiles. However, neither iTunes nor
MusicMatch Jukebox support SACD. If you
buy music in the SACD format, choose the
hybrid format that offers a conventional CD
layer and a high-density SACD layer. You can
then import the music from the conventional
CD layer.
You might also want to take advantage of the com-
pression technology that squeezes more music
onto your iPod. Although the Apple-supported
AAC format offers far better compression and
quality than the MP3 format does (at the same
bit rates), the MP3 format is more universal,
supported by other players and software pro-
grams, as well as the iPod and iTunes. Sticking
with AAC or Apple Lossless as your encoder
might make you feel like your songs are stuck
inside iTunes with the MP3 blues again. However,
with iTunes and your iPod, you can mix and match
these formats as you please.
Manic Compression Has 
Captured Your Song
Every person hears the effects of compression differently. You might not hear
any problem with a compressed song that someone else says is tinny or lack-
ing in depth.
Too much compression can be a bad thing. Further compressing an already-
compressed music file — say, by converting a song — reduces the quality 
significantly. Not only that, but after your song is compressed, you can’t
uncompress the song back to its original quality. Your song is essentially
locked into that quality.

The lossy-style compression used by MP3 and AAC loses information each time
you use it, which means that if you compress something that has already been
compressed, you lose even more information. This is bad. Don’t compress
something that’s already compressed with a lossy method.
The Apple Lossless encoder doesn’t use a lossy method, which is why it’s
called lossless. This is also why it reduces sound files to only two-thirds of
their AIFF or WAV counterparts — which isn’t as useful for saving space as
the one-tenth compression that’s common with MP3 or AAC.
MP3 and AAC use two basic lossy methods to compress audio:
 Removing non-audible frequencies: For non-audible frequencies, the
compression removes what you supposedly can’t hear (although this is a
subject for eternal debate). For example, if a background singer’s warble
is totally drowned out by a rhythm guitar playing a chord, and you can’t
hear the singer due to the intensity of the guitar’s sound, the compression
algorithm loses the singer’s sound while maintaining the guitar’s sound.
 Removing less important signals: Within the spectrum of sound frequen-
cies, some frequencies are considered to be less important in terms of
rendering fidelity, and some frequencies most people can’t hear at all.
Removing specific frequencies is likely to be less damaging to your music
than other types of compression, depending on how you hear things. In
fact, your dog might stop getting agitated at songs that contain ultra-high
frequencies that only dogs can hear (such as the ending of “Day in the
Life” by the Beatles).
Selecting Import Settings
The AAC and MP3 formats compress sound at different quality settings.
iTunes and MusicMatch Jukebox let you set the bit rate for importing,
which determines the audio quality. You need to use a higher bit rate
(such as 192 or 320 Kbps) for higher quality, which — all together now —
increases the file size.
Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encoding is a technique that varies the number of bits
used to store the music depending on the complexity of the sound. Although
the quality of VBR is endlessly debated, it’s useful when set to the highest
setting because VBR can encode at up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps 
in those rare cases where the sound requires it, while keeping the majority 
of the sound at a lower bit rate.
226
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

iTunes and MusicMatch Jukebox also let you control the sample rate during
importing, which is the number of times per second the sound waveform is
captured digitally (or sampled). Higher sample rates yield higher quality sound
and large file sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate than the rate
used for the source. CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate, so choosing a higher rate is
unnecessary unless you convert a song that was recorded from Digital Audio
Tape (DAT) or directly into the computer at a high sample rate, and you want
to keep that sample rate.
Another setting to consider during importing is the Channel choice. Stereo,
which offers two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the norm for
music. However, mono — monaural or single-channel — was the norm for pop
records before the mid-1960s. (Phil Spector was known for his high-quality
monaural recordings, and the early Rolling Stones records are in mono.)
Monaural recordings take up half the space of stereo recordings when digi-
tized. Most likely, you want to keep stereo recordings in stereo, and mono
recordings in mono.

You might want to change your import settings before ripping CDs,
depending on the type of music, the source of the recording, or other
factors, such as whether you plan to copy the songs to your iPod or burn 
an audio or MP3 CD. The encoders offer general quality settings, but you can
also customize the encoders and change those settings to your liking. Whether
you use iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox, the software remembers your custom
settings until you change them again.
This chapter provides the nuts-and-bolts details on changing your import 
settings to customize each type of encoder, importing sounds other than
music, and converting songs from one format to another. With the choice 
of settings for music encoders, you can impress your audiophile friends, 
even ones who doubted that your computer could reproduce magnificent
music.

You can also convert songs to another format as described in “Converting
Songs to a Different Encoder in iTunes” in this chapter. However, you can’t
convert songs that you buy from the iTunes Music Store to another file
format because they’re encoded as protected AAC files. If you could, they
wouldn’t be protected, would they? You also can’t convert Audible books 
and spoken-word content to another format. (However, you can burn them 
to an audio CD and re-import them, which might cause a noticeable drop in
quality.)
Customizing the Encoder 
Settings in iTunes
To change your encoder and quality settings and other importing preferences
before ripping an audio CD or converting a file in iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, or Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC, and then click the Importing tab.
The Importing Preferences dialog appears, allowing you to make
changes to the encoding format and its settings.
2. Choose the encoding format that you want to convert the song into
and select the settings for that format.
The pop-up menus help you make your changes. The Setting pop-up
menu offers different settings depending on your choice of encoder in
the Import Using pop-up menu. See the sections on each encoding
format later in this chapter for details on settings.
3. Click OK to accept changes.
After changing your importing preferences, and until you change them
again, iTunes uses these preferences whenever it imports or converts
songs.
The AAC, MP3, AIFF, and WAV encoders let you change the settings for the
encoders. The Apple Lossless encoder is automatic and offers no settings to
change.
Changing AAC encoder settings
We recommend using the AAC encoder for everything except music that 
you intend to burn on an audio CD; AAC offers the best trade-off of space 
and quality for hard drives and iPods.
230
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The Setting pop-up menu for the AAC encoder offers only two choices: High
Quality and Custom, as shown in Figure 20-1. You might want to use the High
Quality setting for most music, but for very intense music (such as complex
jazz or classical music, recordings with lots of instruments, or your most
favorite songs), you might want to fine-tune the settings. To customize your
AAC encoder settings, select the Custom option from the Setting pop-up menu
to see the AAC Encoder dialog, as shown in Figure 20-2.
The custom settings for AAC (see Figure 20-2) allow you to change the 
following:
 Stereo Bit Rate: This pop-up menu allows you to select the bit rate,
which is measured in kilobits per second (Kbps). Use a higher bit rate
for higher quality, which also increases the file size. 320 Kbps is the 
highest-quality setting for this format; 128 is considered high quality.
 Sample Rate: This pop-up menu enables you to select the sample rate,
which is the number of times per second the sound waveform is cap-
tured digitally (or sampled). Higher sample rates yield higher quality
sound and larger file sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate 
than the rate used for the source. CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate.
 Channels: This pop-up menu enables you to choose how you want the
music to play through speakers — in stereo or mono. Stereo offers two
channels of music for left and right speakers, and mono offers only one
channel but takes up half the space of stereo recordings when digitized.
If the recording is in stereo, don’t choose mono because you will lose
part of the sound (you might lose vocals or guitar riffs, depending on the
recording). Select the Auto setting to have iTunes use the appropriate
setting for the music.

the settings
for the AAC
encoder.
231
Chapter 20: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

We recommend selecting the highest bit rate in the Stereo Bit Rate pop-up
menu and leaving the other two pop-up menus set to Auto.
Changing MP3 encoder settings
We prefer using the AAC encoder for music that we play on our iPods, but as
of this writing, most other MP3 players don’t support AAC. The iPod supports
both AAC and MP3 encoders. You might want to use the MP3 encoder for other
reasons, such as acquiring more control over the compression parameters and
gaining compatibility with other applications and players that support MP3.
The MP3 encoder offers four choices for the Setting pop-up menu in the
Importing Preferences dialog:
 Good Quality (128 Kbps): This is certainly fine for audio books, comedy
records, and old scratchy records. You might even want use a lower bit
rate for voice recordings.
 High Quality (160 Kbps): Most people consider this high enough for
most popular music, but we go higher with our music.
 Higher Quality (192 Kbps): This one’s high enough for just about all
types of music.
 Custom: To fine-tune the MP3 encoder settings, select the Custom set-
ting. Customizing your MP3 settings increases the quality of the sound
and keeps file size low.

232
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The MP3 encoder offers a bunch of choices in its custom settings dialog (see
Figure 20-3):
 Stereo Bit Rate: This pop-up menu’s choices are measured in kilobits
per second; select a higher bit rate for higher quality, which increases
the file size. The most common bit rate for MP3 files you find on the Web
is 128 Kbps. Lower bit rates are more appropriate for voice recordings
or sound effects.
We recommend at least 192 Kbps for most music, and we use 320 Kbps,
the maximum setting, for songs that we play on our iPods.
 Use Variable Bit Rate Encoding (VBR): This option helps keep file size
down, but quality might be affected. VBR varies the number of bits used
to store the music depending on the complexity of the sound. If you
select the Highest setting from the Quality pop-up menu for VBR, iTunes
encodes at up to the maximum bit rate of 320 Kbps in sections of songs
where the sound is complex enough to require a high bit rate. Meanwhile,
iTunes keeps the rest of the song at a lower bit rate to save file space.
The lower limit is set by the rate that you select in the Stereo Bit Rate
pop-up menu.
Some audiophiles swear by VBR, but others don’t ever use it. We use it
only when importing at low bit rates, and we set VBR to its highest qual-
ity setting.
Although your iPod plays VBR-encoded MP3 music, other MP3 players
might not support VBR.
Figure 20-3:

the settings
for the MP3
encoder.
233
Chapter 20: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

 Sample Rate: This pop-up menu enables you to select the sample rate
(the number of times per second that the sound waveform is captured
digitally). Higher sample rates yield higher quality sound and larger file
sizes. However, never use a higher sample rate than the rate used for the
source — CDs use a 44.100 kHz rate.
 Channels: This pop-up menu enables you to choose how you want the
music to play through speakers; in stereo or mono. Stereo, which offers
two channels of music for left and right speakers, is the norm for music.
Monaural (mono) recordings take up half the space of stereo recordings
when digitized. Choose the Auto setting to have iTunes use the appropri-
ate setting for the music.
 Stereo mode: This pop-up menu enables you to select Normal or Joint
Stereo. Normal mode is just what you think it is — normal stereo. Select
the Joint Stereo setting to make the file smaller by removing information
that’s identical in both channels of a stereo recording, using only one
channel for that information while the other channel carries unique
information. At bit rates of 128 Kbps and below, this mode can actually
improve the sound quality. However, we typically don’t use the Joint
Stereo mode when using a high-quality bit rate.
 Smart Encoding Adjustments: This option, when selected, tells iTunes
to analyze your MP3 encoding settings and music source and to change
your settings as needed to maximize the quality of the encoded files.
 Filter Frequencies Below 10 Hz: This option, when selected, filters out
low frequency sounds. Frequencies below 10 Hz are hard to hear, and
most people don’t notice if they’re missing. Filtering inaudible frequen-
cies helps reduce the file size with little or no perceived loss in quality.
However, we think selecting this option and removing the low-frequency
sounds detracts from the overall feeling of the music, and we prefer not
to filter frequencies.
Changing AIFF and WAV encoder settings
We recommend that you use the AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless encoders for
songs from audio CDs if you intend to burn your own audio CDs with the
music. You get the best possible quality with these encoders because the
music isn’t compressed with a lossy algorithm. The Apple Lossless encoder
(which is automatic and offers no settings to change) reduces file size to about
60–70 percent of the size of AIFF or WAV versions. However, AIFF or WAV files
are preferable for use with digital sound-editing programs, and they offer set-
tings that you can change, such as the number of channels (Stereo or Mono)
and the sampling rate.
234
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The difference between the AIFF and WAV encoders is only that AIFF is the
standard for Mac applications and computers, and WAV is the standard for
PC applications and computers.
You can import music with AIFF or WAV at the highest possible quality and
then convert the music files to a lesser-quality format for use in your iPod.
AIFF and WAV files take up huge amounts of hard drive space (about 10MB
per minute), and although you can play them on your iPod, they take up way
too much space and battery power to be convenient for anyone but the most
discerning audiophile who can afford multiple iPods. You can handle these
large files by adding another hard drive or by backing up portions of your
music library onto other media, such as a DVD-R (which can hold 4.7GB).
However, if multiple hard drives and backup scenarios sound like unwanted
hassles, use the AAC or MP3 encoders to compress files so that they take up
less space on your hard drive.
The AIFF encoder and the WAV encoder offer similar custom settings dialogs;
the AIFF Encoder dialog is shown in Figure 20-4. The pop-up menus offer set-
tings for Sample Rate, Sample Size, and Channels. You can select the Auto set-
ting for all three pop-up menus, and iTunes automatically detects the proper
sample rate, size, and channels from the source. If you select a specific setting,
such as the Stereo setting in the Channels pop-up menu, iTunes imports the
music in stereo, regardless of the source. Audio CDs typically sample at a rate
of 44.1000 kHz, with a sample size of 16 bits, and with stereo channels.
The Sample Rate pop-up menu for AIFF and WAV offers more choices than for
AAC, down to a very low sample rate of 8.000 kHz, which is suitable only for
voice recordings.

nels pop-up

Chapter 20: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

Importing Voice and Sound 
Effects in iTunes
Audio books are available from Audible (www.audible.com) in a special format
that doesn’t require any further compression, but you can also import audio
books, spoken-word titles, comedy CDs, and other voice recordings in the
MP3 format.
If the recording has any music at all or requires close listening to stereo 
channels (such as a Firesign Theatre or Monty Python CD), treat the entire
recording as music and skip this section. (“Nudge-nudge, wink-wink. Sorry!
Everything you know is wrong!”)
By fine-tuning the import settings for voice recordings and sound effects, you
can save a significant amount of space without reducing quality. We recom-
mend the following settings depending on your choice of encoder:
 AAC encoder: AAC allows you to get away with an even lower bit rate
than MP3 to achieve the same quality, thereby saving more space. We
recommend a bit rate as low as 80 Kbps for sound effects and voice
recordings.
 MP3 encoder: Use a low bit rate (such as 96 Kbps). You might also 
want to reduce the sample rate to 22.050 kHz for voice recordings. 
Filter frequencies below 10 Hz because voice recordings don’t need 
such frequencies.
Converting Songs to a Different 
Encoder in iTunes
Converting a song from one encoder to another is useful if you want to use
one encoder for one purpose, such as burning a CD, and a second encoder
for another task, such as playing on your iPod.
Converting a song from one compressed format to another is possible (say
from AAC to MP3), but you might not like the results. When you convert a
compressed file to another compressed format, iTunes compresses the music
twice, reducing the quality of the sound. You get the best results by starting
with an uncompressed song that was imported using either the AIFF or WAV
format, and then converting that song to the compressed AAC or MP3 format.
236
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

You can tell what format a song is in by selecting it and choosing File➪Get
Info. Then click the Summary tab to see the song’s format. You might want 
to keep track of formats by creating CD-AIFF-version and iPod-MP3-version
playlists for different formats.
To convert a song to another encoding format, follow these steps:
1. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences on
a Windows PC, and then click the Importing tab.
The Importing Preferences dialog appears, allowing you to make changes
to the encoding format and its settings.
2. Select the encoding format that you want to convert the song into
from the Import Using pop-up menu; in the custom settings dialog that
appears, select the settings for that encoder.
For example, if you’re converting songs in the AIFF format to the MP3
format, choose MP3 Encoder from the Import Using pop-up menu, and
then select the settings that you want in the MP3 Encoder dialog that
appears.
3. Click OK to accept the settings for your chosen format.
4. In the iTunes window, select the song(s) that you want to convert, and
then choose Advanced➪Convert Selection.
The encoding format that you chose in Step 2 appears on the menu:
Convert Selection to MP3, Convert Selection to AAC, Convert Selection
to AIFF, or Convert Selection to WAV. Choose the appropriate menu oper-
ation to perform the conversion. When the conversion is complete, the
newly converted version of the song appears in your iTunes library (with
the same artist name and song name, so it’s easy to find). iTunes doesn’t
delete the original version — both are stored in your music library.
If you convert songs obtained from the Internet, you may find MP3 songs with
bit rates as low as 128 Kbps, and choosing a higher stereo bit rate doesn’t
improve the quality — it only wastes space.
The automatic copy-and-convert operation can be useful for converting 
an entire music library to another format — hold down the Option key on a
Mac, or the Alt key in Windows, and choose Advanced➪Convert Selection,
and all the songs copy and convert automatically. If you have a library of 
AIFF tunes, you can quickly copy and convert them to AAC or MP3 in one
step, and then assign the AIFF songs to the AIFF-associated playlists for 
burning CDs, and MP3 or AAC songs to MP3 or AAC playlists that you intend
to copy to your iPod.

Changing Recorder Settings 
in MusicMatch Jukebox
In MusicMatch Jukebox, encoder settings are called Recorder Settings, and to
change your Recorder Settings in MusicMatch Jukebox, choose Options➪
Settings➪Recorder, which displays the Settings dialog, as shown in Figure 20-5.
From there you have several options, depending on what you want to do.
Selecting MP3 settings
You can select the following quality settings for MP3 recording in MusicMatch
Jukebox:
 CD Quality (128 Kbps): Measured in kilobits per second, this option
offers 128 Kbps, the most common bit rate for MP3 files on the Web. 
The notion that this is “CD quality” is subjective. With this setting, one
minute of music takes up about 1MB of space.
Figure 20-5:

238
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

 Near CD Quality (96 Kbps): This setting offers 96 Kbps, and one minute
of music takes up about 700K. However, we find the quality to be poor.
However, if you don’t hear or mind the difference, you can certainly cram
more music on your iPod with this setting.
 FM Radio Quality (64 Kbps): Bit rates lower than 96 Kbps are more
appropriate for voice recordings or sound effects, not music. One
minute takes up about 400K.
 Custom Quality: This option lets you set the stereo bit rate. A higher 
bit rate offers higher-quality sound and increases the file size. The most
common bit rate for MP3 files you find on the Web is 128 Kbps. Lower 
bit rates are more appropriate for voice recordings or sound effects. 
We recommend at least 192 Kbps for most music, and we use 320 Kbps,
the maximum setting, for songs we play on iPods.
 Custom Quality (VBR): This setting uses Variable Bit Rate (VBR) encod-
ing to vary the number of bits used to store the music depending on 
the complexity of the sound. MusicMatch Jukebox offers a range from 
1 (lowest quality with highest compression) to 100 (highest quality 
with least compression). At its highest setting, VBR might use the high-
est bit rate of 320 Kbps in sections of songs where the sound is complex
enough to require a high bit rate, while keeping the rest of the song at a
lower bit rate to save file space. We recommend using only the highest
setting if you use VBR at all.
 Digital: MusicMatch Jukebox can record from a digital or analog source.
When ripping CDs, select the Digital option. You can also use the Error
correction option to filter out noise and produce better results with CDs
that have minor scratches. If you hear clicks and pops or a jittery sound
in the recorded digital music, try using this option, which minimizes the
audio artifacts that occur from drive-seeking errors. Recording time takes
longer, but the recording quality might be better with some CD-ROM
drives.
 Analog: The Analog setting, which records in real time, is by far the slow-
est method and is provided for recording from slow CD-ROM drives to get
higher-quality results.
Selecting WAV
Use WAV, which offers the highest possible quality, if you plan on burning the
song to an audio CD. The files occupy lots more space than MP3 files because
they aren’t compressed. One minute of music in the WAV format occupies
about 10MB of hard drive or iPod space. CD Quality is the only option for WAV.
239
Chapter 20: Changing Encoders and Encoder Settings

Using advanced recording options
MusicMatch Jukebox offers advanced settings, which are available by 
clicking the Advanced button in the Settings dialog (refer to Figure 20-5). 
The Advanced Recording Options dialog appears, and you can set a variety 
of recording options and special effects.
The following options improve the recording quality while ripping songs 
from CDs:
 MP3 Encoding: You can force recording into Stereo or Mono formats with
this option. By default, MusicMatch Jukebox is set to use the appropriate
setting that matches the source — Stereo for stereo sources and Mono
for mono sources.
 Maximum Bandwidth: This option sets the range of frequencies allowed
in the MP3 file. The human ear can theoretically hear frequencies up to
22 kHz, but many humans actually can’t hear anything above 16 kHz. If
you want frequencies higher than 16 kHz (often found in classical music),
you can adjust this slider up. 
 Auto Config: The Auto Config button automatically configures
MusicMatch Jukebox for your CD-ROM drive and should be used when-
ever you change drives. You can select the sample size (short, medium,
or long) in the drop-down list before configuring. Although most drives
can be configured using the short or medium sample size, some need
the long size.
240
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 
Using the mp3PRO encoder
MusicMatch Jukebox also offers the mp3PRO
encoder for creating smaller MP3 files that come
close in quality to the larger files created by the
default MP3 encoder. The mp3PRO encoder can
create files that are nearly 50 percent smaller,
but it offers low bit rate settings up to only 96
Kbps — suitable for mono records from before
1960 and voice recordings, but not much else.
(Use the MP3 encoder for higher bit rate settings.) 
The mp3PRO encoder offers the CD Transparency
setting for 96 Kbps, which is the only setting we’d
recommend. The lower settings are not useful
as the sound quality is poor (in our opinion). You
can also set a custom bit rate, but not higher than
96 Kbps. Variable Bit Rate (VBR) is also provided. 

 Digital Audio Extraction (DAE): If your audio files sound like they play
too fast, it might be due to your CD drive not operating fast enough to
keep up with the recording process — a drive speed/recording speed
mismatch. Changing the DAE Speed setting to 4 (for a 4X recording speed)
generally fixes this problem. If not, you can try 2X or real-time recording
(1X). If you hear jitter in the sound even with error correction on, try
turning the Multipass option on so that MusicMatch Jukebox reads the
CD track multiple times, ensuring a successful recording (but also increas-
ing recording time). 
The following are special effects that you might want to use while recording
songs:
 Fade In: You can record a song with a fade-in at the beginning and set
the number of seconds for the fade-in. The fade-in is recorded along with
the audio so that it is permanently part of the music file.
 Fade Out: You can record a song with a fade-out at the end and set the
number of seconds for the fade-out. The fade-out is also permanently
part of the music file.
 Track Offset: Use this option to start the recording process a number 
of seconds into the track instead of at the very beginning. For example,
if a CD track has no sound or an introduction that you want to skip, you
can specify the number of seconds to skip (or offset) before starting to
record.

 Creating and assigning equalizer presets to songs
 Using the iPod equalizer
 Using iTunes equalizer presets in your iPod 
S
ound is difficult to describe. Harder still to describe is how to adjust
sound to your liking. Maybe you want more oomph in the lows, or you
prefer highs that are as clear as a bell. If you’ve never mastered a stereo
system beyond adjusting the bass and treble controls, the volume control,
and the loudness button, you can use this limited knowledge of sound to
quickly fine-tune the sound in iTunes, as we show in this chapter.
If you’re a discerning listener, you might want to change the equalizer settings
in iTunes and perhaps even use different settings for different songs. With
iTunes, you have to change those settings only once. This chapter shows you
how to make presets for each song in your library so that iTunes remembers
them. What’s more, you can use the iTunes settings on your iPod, which also
offers an equalizer. This chapter shows you how.
Adjusting the Sound in iTunes
Some songs are just too loud. We don’t mean too loud stylistically, as in
thrash metal with screeching guitars; we mean too loud for your ears when
you’re wearing headphones or so loud that the music sounds distorted in
your speakers. And some songs are just too soft, and you have to turn up 
the volume to hear them, then turn it down to hear other songs. Is there a
way to set the volume in advance for a certain song or album? 

Of course there is — you can set the overall volume in advance in the song
information dialog by choosing File➪Get Info. You can also make all the songs
in your library play at the same volume by leveling the volume with the Sound
Check option.
You can change the volume level at any time by sliding the volume slider in
the upper-left section of the iTunes window. The maximum volume of the
iTunes volume slider is the maximum set for the computer’s sound in the
Sound pane of System Preferences, as we describe in Chapter 18.
Setting the volume in advance for songs
With songs that you already know are too loud (or too soft), consider setting
the volume for those songs (or certain albums) in advance, so that they always
play with that volume adjustment.
To adjust the overall volume of a particular song in advance, so that it always
plays at that setting, perform the following steps:
1. Click a song to select it.
2. Choose File➪Get Info. 
The song information dialog appears.
3. Click the Options tab.
Drag the Volume Adjustment slider left or right to adjust the volume lower
or higher, as shown in Figure 21-1. You can do this while playing the song.
Figure 21-1:
Adjust the
volume
setting for a

244
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

To set the volume for more than one song at once, you can select an entire
album in iTunes Browse view or select multiple songs; then choose Get Info
to open the Multiple Song Information dialog. The Volume Adjustment slider
appears on the bottom-right corner of the dialog. Drag the slider as described
earlier to set the volume adjustment for the entire album of songs or the
selected songs.
Enhancing the sound
Audiophiles and sound purists frown on it, but many of you probably use the
loudness button on home or car stereos to enhance the sound. iTunes offers
a similar option — Sound Enhancer — that improves the depth of the sound
by enhancing the high and low frequencies. Audiophiles and sound purists
would most likely use the equalizer to boost frequencies, but you can use
this brute force method to enhance the sound.
To turn on Sound Enhancer, choose Preferences (from the iTunes menu on a
Mac/Edit menu on a Windows PC). Click the Audio button to show the Audio
dialog, as shown in Figure 21-2.
To increase the sound enhancement (boosting the high and low frequencies),
drag the Sound Enhancer slider to the right toward the High setting. This is
similar to pressing the loudness button on a stereo or the equivalent of boost-
ing the treble (high) and bass (low) frequencies in the equalizer (as we describe
in “Equalize It in iTunes,” later in this chapter). To decrease the high and low
frequencies, drag the slider to the left toward the Low setting. The middle
setting is neutral, adding no enhancement — the same as turning off the
Sound Enhancer by clearing its check box.

Chapter 21: Fine-Tuning the Sound

Sound-checking the iTunes volume
Because music CDs are mastered differently, there can be discrepancies in
volume between them. Some CDs play more loudly than others; occasionally,
individual tracks within a CD are louder than others.
You can standardize the volume level of all the songs in your iTunes music
library with the Sound Check option. Hey, musicians do a sound check 
before every performance to check the volume of microphones and instru-
ments and its effect on the listening environment. The aptly named Sound
Check option in iTunes allows you to do a sound check on your tunes to
bring them all in line, volume-wise. This option has the added benefit of
applying the same volume adjustment when you play the songs back on 
your iPod, as described in the upcoming section, “Sound-checking the iPod
volume.”
To ensure that all the songs in your library ripped from CDs play at the same
volume level, follow these steps:
1. Drag the iTunes volume slider to set the overall volume for iTunes.
The volume slider is in the top-left corner of the iTunes window, under
the Play button.
2. Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a
Windows PC.
The Preferences dialog appears.
3. Click the Audio button.
The Audio preferences dialog appears (refer to Figure 21-2).
4. Select the Sound Check check box.
iTunes sets the volume level for all songs according to the level of the
iTunes volume slider.
5. Click OK.
The Sound Check option sets a volume adjustment based on the
volume slider on all the songs so that they play at approximately 
the same volume.
Sound-checking the iPod volume
You can take advantage of volume leveling in your iTunes music library with
the Sound Check option, and then turn Sound Check on or off on your iPod
by choosing Sound Check in the iPod Settings menu.
246
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

This is useful especially when using your iPod in a car (or when jogging while
listening to headphones) because you don’t want to have to reach for the
volume on the iPod or on the car stereo every time a song comes on that’s
too loud. However, the Sound Check option on your iPod works only if you’ve
also set the Sound Check option in your iTunes library. (Audio purists frown
on volume leveling as much as they frown on sound enhancement, preferring
to adjust the volume only when they need to.)
In iTunes, select the Sound Check option as we describe in the preceding section,
“Sound-checking the iTunes volume.” Then, on the iPod, choose Settings➪
Sound Check➪On from the main menu to turn on the Sound Check feature.
To turn it off, choose Settings➪Sound Check➪Off.
Equalize It in iTunes
The iTunes equalizer (EQ) allows you to fine-tune the specific sound spec-
trum frequencies in a more precise way than with the typical bass and treble
controls you find on home stereos and powered speakers. (See the sidebar on
equalizers, elsewhere in this chapter.) You can use the equalizer to improve or
enhance the sound coming through a particular stereo system and speakers.
With the equalizer settings, you can customize playback for different musical
genres, listening environments, or speakers.
You might want to pick entirely different equalizer settings for car speakers,
home speakers, and headphones. Fortunately, you can save your settings, as
we describe in the upcoming “Saving your own presets” section.
To see the iTunes equalizer, click the Equalizer button, which is the icon with
three mixer faders on the bottom-right side of the iTunes window. (On a Mac,
you can also choose Window➪Equalizer.)
Adjusting the preamp volume
The preamp in your stereo is the component that offers a volume control that
applies to all frequencies equally.
Volume knobs generally go up to 10 — except, of course, for Spinal Tap’s pre-
amps, which go to 11.
The iTunes equalizer, as shown in Figure 21-3, offers a Preamp slider on the
far-left side. You can increase or decrease the volume in 3-decibel (dB) incre-
ments up to 12 dB. Decibels are units that measure the intensity (or volume)
of the frequencies. You can adjust the volume while playing the music to hear
the result right away.
247
Chapter 21: Fine-Tuning the Sound

You might want to increase the preamp volume for songs recorded too softly,
or decrease it for songs that are so loud you can hear distortion. If you want
to make any adjustments to frequencies, you might need to adjust the preamp
volume first if volume adjustment is needed, and then move on to the specific
frequencies.
Adjusting frequencies
You can adjust frequencies in the iTunes equalizer by clicking and dragging
sliders that look like mixing-board faders.
The horizontal values across the equalizer represent the spectrum of human
hearing. The deepest frequency (“Daddy sang bass”) is 32 hertz (Hz); the
midrange frequencies are 250 Hz and 500 Hz, and the higher frequencies go
from 1 kilohertz (kHz) to 16 kHz (treble).
The vertical values on each bar represent decibels, which measure the 
intensity of each frequency. Increase or decrease the frequencies at 3 dB
increments by clicking and dragging the sliders up and down. You can drag
the sliders to adjust the frequencies while the music is playing, to hear the
effect immediately.
Using iTunes’ presets
iTunes offers presets, which are equalizer settings made in advance and saved
by name. You can quickly switch settings without having to make changes to
each frequency slider. iTunes comes with more than 20 presets of the most
commonly used equalizer settings, for each musical genre from classical to
rock. You can then assign the equalizer settings to a specific song or set of
songs in your iTunes library.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

These settings copy to your iPod along with the songs when you update 
your iPod.
To use an equalizer preset, click the pop-up menu in the Equalizer window at
the top of the equalizer, as shown in Figure 21-4, to select a preset. If a song is
playing, you hear the effect in the sound immediately after choosing the preset.
Saving your own presets
You can create your own equalizer presets. When you make the changes that
you want to the frequencies, and the pop-up menu automatically switches to
Manual when you drag the sliders to change the frequencies. Then choose
the Make Preset option from the pop-up menu (refer to Figure 21-4) to save
your changes. The Make Preset dialog appears, as shown in Figure 21-5. Give
your new preset a descriptive name. The name appears in the pop-up menu
from that point on — your very own preset.

You can rename or delete the presets by choosing the Edit List option from
the pop-up menu, which displays the Edit Presets dialog for renaming or delet-
ing presets, as shown in Figure 21-6. Click Rename to rename a preset, click
Delete to delete a preset, and click Done when you’re finished editing the list.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 
What’s the frequency, Kenneth? 
The Equalizer opportunity
The Beach Boys were right when they sang “Good
Vibrations” because that’s what music is — the
sensation of hearing audible vibrations conveyed
to the ear by a medium such as air. The frequency
of vibrations per second is how we measure pitch.
The waves can fluctuate slowly and produce
low-pitched sounds, or they can fluctuate rapidly
and produce high-pitched sounds. The amplitude
is a measurement of the amount of fluctuation in
air pressure — therefore, amplitude is perceived
as loudness.
When you turn up the bass or treble on a stereo
system, you are actually increasing the volume, or
intensity, of certain frequencies while the music is
playing. The equalizer lets you fine-tune the sound
spectrum frequencies in a more precise way than
with bass and treble controls. It increases or
decreases specific frequencies of the sound to
raise or lower highs, lows, and midrange tones.
The equalizer does this with several band-pass
filters all centered at different frequencies, and
each filter offers controllable gain (the ability to
boost the volume).
On more sophisticated stereo systems, an equal-
izer with a bar graph display replaces the bass
and treble controls. An equalizer (EQ in audio-
speak) enables you to fine-tune the specific
sound spectrum frequencies, which gives you
far greater control than merely adjusting the bass
or treble controls.

You can rename or delete any preset, including the ones supplied with iTunes
(which is useful if you want to recall a preset by another name).
Assigning equalizer presets to songs
One reason why you go to the trouble of setting equalizer presets is to assign
the presets to individual songs. The next time you play the song, it will use
the equalizer preset that you assigned.
When you transfer the songs to your iPod, the preset assignments stay
assigned to them, and you can choose whether to use the preset assign-
ments when playing the songs on your iPod.
Assign an equalizer preset to a song or set of songs by following these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪View Options.
The View Options dialog appears, as shown in Figure 21-7.
2. Select the Equalizer check box and then click OK.
The Equalizer column appears in the song list in the iTunes window.
You can combine Steps 1 and 2 by Control-clicking any song list column
heading on a Mac (or right-clicking on a Windows PC), and then choosing
Equalizer from the shortcut menu that appears.
Figure 21-7:

Chapter 21: Fine-Tuning the Sound

3. Locate a song in the song list and scroll the song list horizontally to
see the Equalizer column, as shown in Figure 21-8.
4. Choose a preset from the pop-up menu in the Equalizer column.
The Equalizer column has a tiny pop-up menu that allows you to assign
any preset to a song.
When you transfer songs with presets to the iPod, the presets can be used for
song playback using the iPod equalizer.
Equalize It in Your iPod
You leave the back-road bliss of the country to get on the freeway, and now
the music in your car doesn’t have enough bass to give you that thumping
rhythm you need to dodge other cars. What can you do? Without endanger-
ing anybody, you can pull over and select one of the iPod equalizer presets,
such as Bass Booster.
Yes, your iPod also has a built-in equalizer. Like the iTunes equalizer, the iPod
built-in equalizer modifies the volume of the frequencies of the sound. And
although you don’t have sliders for faders like the iTunes equalizer, you do
get the same long list of presets to suit the type of music or the type of envi-
ronment. You can use the iPod equalizer for on-the-fly adjustments.
Figure 21-8:

252
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The iPod equalizer uses a bit more battery power when it’s turned on, so you
might have less playing time on your iPod battery.
You can also use the iTunes equalizer to improve or enhance the sound,
assigning presets to each song and then updating your iPod.
Choosing an EQ preset on your iPod
To select an iPod equalizer preset, choose Settings from the main menu and
then choose EQ from the Settings menu. The EQ is set to Off until you select
one of the presets.
Each EQ preset offers a different balance of frequencies designed to enhance
the sound in certain ways. For example, Bass Booster increases the volume of
the low (bass) frequencies; Treble Booster does the same to the high (treble)
frequencies.
To see what a preset actually does to the frequencies, open the iTunes equal-
izer and select the same preset. The faders in the equalizer display show you
exactly what the preset does.
The Off setting turns off the iPod equalizer — no presets are used, not even
one you assigned in iTunes. You have to choose an EQ preset to turn on the
iPod equalizer.
Applying the iTunes EQ presets
When you assign a preset to the song using iTunes, the iPod uses the assigned
EQ preset from iTunes even when you choose an EQ preset on the iPod. That’s
right — the assigned EQ preset from iTunes takes precedence over the preset
in the iPod.
Here’s a workaround, though. If you know in advance that you need to use
specific presets for certain songs, assign presets to the songs in iTunes
before copying the songs to the iPod. If, on the other hand, you don’t want
the songs fixed to use a certain preset, don’t assign presets to the songs in
iTunes. You can then experiment with the presets in the iPod to get better
playback in different listening environments.
253
Chapter 21: Fine-Tuning the Sound

To assign built-in or custom presets to songs with the iTunes equalizer, see
“Assigning equalizer presets to songs,” earlier in this chapter.
After assigning a preset to a song in iTunes, you turn on the iPod equalizer by
choosing any EQ setting (other than Off), and the iPod uses the song’s preset
for playback.

Recording and Editing Sound
In This Chapter
 Recording cassettes, vinyl records, and other analog sources of sound
 Choosing a Macintosh or Windows application to record and edit sound
 Using MusicMatch Jukebox to record sound
 Defining start and stop times for a song
 Separating a long track into separate tracks in iTunes
You can find millions of songs on the Internet, and some digital recordings
of songs might even be good enough to please audiophiles. With so many
songs available in the iTunes Music Store for just 99 cents each, it doesn’t make
sense to spend a lot of time recording and digitizing the hits from your record
collection, or even the B-sides and album cuts — most likely those songs are
also available.
However, you might have sounds that were never released on CD or made
available to the public. Rare record collectors and tape archivists — you
know who you are — have sounds that you just can’t find on the Internet or
on CD, and if you create your own music, how do you get that stuff into your
iTunes library so that you can burn a CD or include the songs on your iPod?
This chapter explains what you need to record and digitize sounds from other
sources, such as tape players and turntables, and store the digital recordings
in your iTunes library. It also shows you how to set the start and stop times of
songs in your iTunes library, which is a trick you can use to edit the beginnings
and endings of songs.
All the applications described in this chapter are commercially available for
downloading from the Internet. Some are free to use, some are free for a limited
time before you have to pay, and some require cash up front. Nevertheless,
all are worth checking out if you have sounds you want to put into iTunes.

Recording Records, Tapes, 
and Analog Sources
Sound can be brought directly into your computer from a sound system or
home stereo that offers a stereo audio output connection (such as Tape Out),
or even directly from a cassette player or microphone. If you have old vinyl
records with music that can’t be found anymore, on CD or otherwise, you can
convert the music to digital by using a phonograph connected to a stereo
system with a Tape Out connection.
Songs already converted to digital can be copied into iTunes directly without
any recording procedure. For example, MP3 CDs are easy to import. Because
they’re essentially data CDs, simply insert them into your CD-ROM drive,
open the CD in the Finder, and drag and drop the MP3 song files into the
iTunes window, as we describe in Chapter 5. Downloaded song files are even
easier — just drag and drop the files into iTunes. If you drag a folder or CD
icon, all the audio files that it contains are added to your iTunes library.
Before recording sound into your computer, be sure that you have enough
disk space to record the audio in an uncompressed form (which is best for
highest quality). If you’re recording an hour of high-quality music, you need
about 600MB of disk space to record it.
Connecting and setting up audio input
Most computers offer a Line In connection that accepts a cable with a stereo
mini-plug. You can connect any kind of mono or stereo audio source, such as
an amplifier or preamp, a CD or DVD player, or an all-in-one stereo system that
offers recording through a Tape Out or similar connection.
Find the Line Out or Tape Out connection in your stereo system, and connect
a cable that uses RCA-type left and right stereo plugs or a stereo mini-plug to
this connection (see Chapter 16 for more information about audio cables).
Connect the stereo mini-plug to your computer’s Line In connection. You can
then record anything that plays on your home stereo into your computer.
If your computer doesn’t offer a Line In connection, you can purchase a
Universal Serial Bus (USB) audio input device, such as the Griffin iMic or the
Roland UA-30 for the Mac, or the Griffin PowerWave for Mac or Windows PC
(www.griffintechnology.com). The PowerWave USB Audio Interface and
Desktop Amplifier enables you to record any microphone or line input into
256
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

your computer. The PowerWave is also an integrated desktop amplifier that
you can use to connect any set of home speakers to your computer.
When recording from a phonograph (turntable for vinyl records), the phono-
graph must either include an amplifier or be connected to an amplifier in
order to raise the signal to line levels and apply proper equalization curves.
After connecting the audio source to your computer, set the audio input for
your computer and adjust the volume for recording.
On a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple menu or the Dock, and
then click the Sound icon.
2. Click the Input tab.
The Input tab displays the sound input preferences, as shown in Fig-
ure 22-1.
3. Choose Line In from the list of input devices.
Use Line In to record into your computer. The alternative is to use the
built-in microphone, which is useful for recording live performances —
but not for records or tapes because it also picks up any noise in the room.
Figure 22-1:

Chapter 22: Recording and Editing Sound

4. Adjust the volume for the Line In input.
To set the volume level for sound input, start playing the record, tape, or
source of sound. As it plays, watch the input level meter. As the volume
gets louder, the oblong purple dots seem to light up with highlights, from
left to right. To adjust the volume, drag the slider underneath the input
level meter. If all the dots are highlighted all the time, you’re way too hot
(studio tech talk for being too loud). If the dots are not highlighted at all,
you’re way too low. (For some reason, the studio techs don’t say cool or
cold — just low.) You want the dots to be highlighted about three-fourths
of the way across from left to right for optimal input volume.
5. Quit System Preferences by choosing System Preferences➪Quit System
Preferences, or by clicking the red button in the top-left corner of the
window.
On a Windows PC, you must have a Line In connection and an audio card
driver that controls it. Some PCs are equipped only with microphone-
controlling drivers, and some offer both Line In and microphone input. 
If you have the appropriate hardware, follow these steps:
1. Open the sound properties control panel.
In Windows XP, select Control Panel from the Start menu, and click 
the Sounds and Audio Devices icon. The Sounds and Audio Devices
Properties window appears. Depending on your version of Windows, 
you might have a Control Panel specific for the audio driver and hard-
ware, or Windows Mixer, or the Sound and Audio Devices control panel.
You can open the appropriate control program by right-clicking the small
speaker icon in your system tray, and choosing Adjust Audio Properties.
In Windows Mixer, choose Options➪Properties.
2. Click the Audio tab in the row of tabs along the top of the window.
As shown in Figure 22-2, the Sounds and Audio Devices Properties
window offers sections for sound playback, sound recording, and MIDI
(Musical Instrument Digital Interface) music playback.
3. Choose the input device for sound recording.
Use the drop-down list in the Sound recording section to choose the
input device, which is the hardware for controlling the Line In connec-
tion or microphone. In Windows Mixer, select Recording under Adjust
volume and then turn on the option for Line-In or Microphone to get to
the Recording Control panel.
4. Click the Volume button in the Sound recording section to set the
input volume.
258
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

The Volume window offers a volume slider. Drag this slider to set the
input volume (to the left is low, to the right is high).
5. Click OK to finish and save your settings.
After setting up the audio input and adjusting the volume, you need to launch
an application that records sound.
Choosing a sound editing application
The Sound Studio application lets you record and digitize directly to your hard
disk on a Mac running OS X. Some Mac models include a free copy of Sound
Studio. (You can find it in the Applications folder.) You can also download a
copy from Felt Tip Software (www.felttip.com/products/soundstudio).
You can use it for two weeks before having to pay $49.99 for it.
Toast 6 Titanium from Roxio (www.roxio.com) for Mac OS X includes the 
CD Spin Doctor application for recording sounds. The Windows version 
of CD Spin Doctor is part of the Easy CD Creator 5 Platinum package from
Roxio. CD Spin Doctor offers a Noise Reducer option to select filters for noise
reduction: de-click removes loud distortions, which occur frequently with
vinyl records; de-crackle removes surface crackling, which happens often
with well-played vinyl records; and de-hiss removes the hissing noise that
occurs with many different analog sources, including records and tapes.

Recording in Windows with 
MusicMatch Jukebox
You can also use MusicMatch Jukebox to record sound through a PC’s Line In
connection. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Options➪Settings and click the Recorder tab.
2. Select Line In from the Recording source pop-up menu.
Alternatively, you can choose Options➪Recorder➪Source ➪Line In.
MusicMatch Jukebox uses the Recorder Settings for recording the audio
(which you can set by choosing Options➪Settings➪Recorder).
3. Start the source sound player, and click the Record (record) button in
the Recorder window to start recording from the analog source. 
Each recorded segment is listed in the Recorder window as a separate
song with a generic title.
MusicMatch Jukebox provides the Auto Song Detect option that can detect the
end of a song from an analog source (such as a phonograph or tape player).
To use it, choose Options➪Settings➪Recorder, and then click the Advanced
button. Click the Active button to turn on Auto Song Detect. You can set the
Gap Length, which is the amount of time between songs (typically about
1.5 seconds, or about 1,500 milliseconds [ms]) that MusicMatch Jukebox
uses to determine when a song ends and another begins. You can also set
the Gap Level, which tells MusicMatch Jukebox to listen for a certain volume
level to determine when a song is over (typically about 10 percent of the total
volume or less).
MusicMatch Jukebox saves the recording using the encoding format that you
set in Recorder Settings (which you can set prior to recording by choosing
Options➪Settings➪Recorder). The recording is automatically added to your
MusicMatch Jukebox library, which you can use to update your iPod, as we
describe in Chapter 12.
Modifying Songs in iTunes
Although iTunes was never meant to be a song editing application, it offers a
simple control over the starting and stopping points for playing back a song.
You can use this feature to cut out unwanted intros and outros of a song, such
as announcers and audience applause. You can also use it in conjunction with
the Convert feature to split a track into multiple tracks.
260
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

To do more significant modifications or editing, use the applications that we
describe in “Recording Records, Tapes, and Analog Sources,” earlier in this
chapter, or use GarageBand on a Mac.
Setting the start and stop points in a song
iTunes will play only a portion of a song if you specify start and stop times
within the song. To set the start and/or stop points in a song, select the song
and choose File➪Get Info; then click Options to show the dialog that lets you
specify the start and stop times, as shown in Figure 22-3.
Click inside the Start Time field to set the start time; for example, in Figure
22-3, we set the Start Time to 0:30 (30 seconds). Click inside the Stop Time
field to set the stop time. The time is in minutes, seconds, and hundredths of
a second (decimal) — 8:15.978 is 8 minutes and 15.978 seconds.
To determine with accuracy the time for the start and stop points, play the
song and look in the Status pane at the top-center part of the iTunes window
for the Elapsed Time. You can drag the slider in the Status pane to move
quickly through the song and find the exact times for the start and stop points
you want to set. Note: If you click Elapsed Time in the Status pane, it toggles
to Remaining Time; click it again for Total Time, and click it once more to see
Elapsed Time again.
Figure 22-3:
Set the 
start time
for a song.
261
Chapter 22: Recording and Editing Sound

iTunes plays only the part of the song between the start and stop times. You
can use this feature to your advantage because when you convert the song,
iTunes converts only the part of the song between the start and stop times.
Splitting a track into multiple tracks
You might have a CD that was created with all the songs combined into one
track, or you might have recorded an entire side of a vinyl record or cassette
tape into one sound file. Either way, you probably want to separate the songs
into separate tracks in iTunes.
The best way to split a long track into smaller tracks is to open the sound file
in a sound editing program that lets you select sections and save them sepa-
rately, such as CD Spin Doctor or Sound Studio, as we describe in “Recording
Records, Tapes, and Analog Sources,” earlier in this chapter.
However, you can also separate a track into smaller tracks in iTunes, as long
as you use the AIFF format at first. Follow these steps:
1. Before ripping a CD or importing a sound file, set the encoder in your
importing preferences to AIFF.
Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows PC.
Click Importing, and set your Importing encoder to AIFF (full quality).
2. Rip the CD track into iTunes or import an AIFF sound file into iTunes.
Because you set the importing preferences to AIFF, the CD track is
imported into iTunes as AIFF at full quality. You want to do this because
you’re going to convert it in iTunes later, and you need the uncompressed
version to convert. Use a song name to identify this track as a long track
with multiple tracks — for example, call it side one or something like that.
3. Change your Importing preferences to AAC or MP3. (We use AAC
mostly.)
Choose iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on a Windows
PC. Click Importing, and set your Importing encoder to AAC or MP3.
Now you’re ready to convert the song segments from the long track.
4. Select the song in iTunes and choose File➪Get Info.
The song information dialog appears.
5. Click Options to show the Start Time and Stop Time fields.
You can set the start and stop times for the song (refer to Figure 22-3).
262
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

6. Define the Start Time and Stop Time for the first song in the long
track.
Play the song and look in the Status pane at the top-center part of the
iTunes window for the Elapsed Time. You can drag the slider in the Status
pane to move quickly through the song and find the exact times for the
start and stop points you want to set. For example, if the first song were
exactly 3 minutes and 12 seconds, you would define the first section to
start at 0:00 and play to 3:12.
7. Convert the defined segment of the long track from AIFF to AAC 
or MP3.
Select the long track (side one) and choose Advanced➪Convert Selection
to AAC (or Advanced➪Convert Selection to MP3 if you chose the MP3
encoder in Step 6). iTunes converts only the section of the song defined
by the Start Time and Stop Time fields that you set in Step 5, and creates
a new song track in the AAC or MP3 format (depending on your choice
in Step 3). iTunes converts the uncompressed AIFF segment into the
compressed AAC or MP3 format.
8. Change the song name of the newly converted track to the actual
song name.
The converted section of the long track still has the same name (side one).
Change its name by clicking inside the song name in the iTunes song list,
or by choosing File➪Get Info, clicking the Info tab, and clicking inside
the Name field. You can also enter a track number in the Track field. The
converted song starts and stops as you specified in Step 5; because it’s
also converted to AAC or MP3, it’s ready for use in your iTunes library
and in your iPod.
9. Repeat Steps 4 through 8 for each song segment.
10. When finished, delete the long track in AIFF format.
Delete the long track (side one) by selecting it and pressing Delete/
Backspace. You don’t need it anymore if you converted all the segments
to separate songs.

Enhancing Your Music Library
In This Chapter
 Downloading music from other sources
 Playing streaming broadcasts and Web radio in iTunes
 Changing the MusicMatch Jukebox look and feel
Your music library is the center of your iPod and iTunes world — your
control console for playing Master DJ at the party, your basement studio
for burning CDs, and your archive of the most important music in the universe.
Of course you would want to enhance it in any way possible. 
In this chapter, we cover ways to enhance your iTunes or MusicMatch Jukebox
library. We cover downloading music from online sources other than the
iTunes Music Store as well as playing Web radio streams on your computer
using iTunes.
Downloading Music from Other Sources
The iTunes Music Store isn’t the only place to get music for your iPod online.
With the launch of several digital music services over the past two years
(including Napster 2.0, BuyMusic.com, MusicNow, and MusicMatch) and a
growing list of new services queuing up to launch, the digital music land-
scape is rapidly evolving.
iTunes can store MP3, AIFF, Apple Lossless, and WAV files as well as pro-
tected AAC files. If you already have Windows Media Player version 9 or
newer installed on your PC, the Windows version of iTunes can also con-
vert unprotected Windows Media (WMA) files that don’t include any digital
rights management (DRM) wrappers of the sort found on files downloaded
from services such as the relaunched Napster. (This is the same problem 
that Windows Media players have with iTunes AAC files.)

If you buy protected music in the Windows Media format or other protected
format, you can always burn a CD of the music and then rip the CD into iTunes.
It’s a good practice to burn a CD of music that you buy online to have a backup
copy in mint condition. If you download unprotected music (such as free pro-
motions from bands), you can import the music files into iTunes if they are in
the MP3 format, and with the Windows version of iTunes, you can also import
unprotected Windows Media formats. See Chapter 5 for details on how to
import music files into iTunes.
Music sources for iTunes and 
MusicMatch Jukebox
You can find music in the following types of places online:
 From the source: Artists and musicians are increasingly offering their
music on their own Web sites for free. This is the best source of free
music because it’s legal and benefits the artists directly — they want
you to listen and tell your friends. Examples include The Zen Tricksters
(www.zentricksters.com/home.html), Little Feat (www.littlefeat.
net), and the Flying Other Brothers (www.flyingotherbros.com).
 Protected music: Online music stores and services offer protected music
for sale. Windows Media-protected songs and other protected formats
can’t be imported into iTunes because they’re tied to the computer and
player used for the format. However, you can burn a CD with the music
(using a different player, such as Windows Media Player) and then rip the
CD into iTunes. You lose no quality because burning a CD doesn’t reduce
the music’s quality, and ripping the CD in iTunes doesn’t reduce the
music’s quality if you use the AIFF format or the Apple Lossless encoder
(or reduces quality only slightly if you use the AAC or MP3 encoders
with the same or higher bit rate — see Chapter 20 for information about
setting the AAC or MP3 encoder bit rate). You can also rip the CD into
MusicMatch Jukebox using the WAV or MP3 encoders.
 Unprotected music: Some online services and Web sites offer unprotected
music for sale or for free downloading as part of a promotion for artists.
These sites and services typically offer MP3 or Windows Media (WMA)
unprotected files that you can import directly into iTunes or MusicMatch
Jukebox, and import WMA files into the Windows version of iTunes. 
For example, Warp Records (a prominent electronic music label) hosts
Bleep.com (www.warprecords.com/bleep), which offers downloads of
ordinary MP3s from several independent labels, without copy protection,
for about $1.35 a song.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

 Swapped music: Free and “pirate” networks using peer-to-peer technol-
ogy allow users to “swap” music for free. That is, people can trade music,
but the network essentially allows them to download music from others
on the network for free. Some networks require registration for (cough)
joining them so that they maintain the semblance of privacy. Others
operate outside the legal jurisdiction of the U.S. copyright law and the
laws of other countries. We don’t like to recommend these networks for
two reasons. One, the music might be pirated (and we believe copyright
owners deserve to have some control over distribution, even free distri-
bution). Two, the music might not be the highest quality because of com-
promises (such as lower bit rates for MP3 files, which make for poorer
quality music).
If you have a choice of music formats to download, choose the highest quality
format that you can download (depending on the bandwidth of your Internet
connection) — typically MP3 at the highest bit rate offered. iTunes can import
AIFF, WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless, and MP3 files, and the Windows version of
iTunes can also import WMA (unprotected) files if you have Windows Media
Player version 9 installed on your PC. MusicMatch Jukebox can import WAV,
MP3, or WMA (unprotected) files. You can use AIFF, WAV, AAC, Apple Lossless,
or MP3 files in your iPod, and convert files from other formats into these for-
mats as we describe in Chapter 20.
Using the MusicMatch 
Jukebox Music Guide
The MusicMatch Music Guide helps you find free MP3 files on the Internet to
listen to and commercial music to purchase. You can search for and download
free music, music videos, and photos from popular artists. Music Guide can
also make recommendations based on your personal preferences, matched to
other users on the Internet with similar preferences.
Opening the Music Guide
To open Music Guide, launch MusicMatch Jukebox and choose View➪Music
Guide. The Music Guide appears in place of your music library in MusicMatch
Jukebox, as shown in Figure 23-1. You can find an artist or pick artists in a par-
ticular genre by clicking Browse Artist. Here you’ll find an extensive list of
genres (such as Rock, Classical, Bluegrass, Gospel, and so on), or you can
enter an artist or album name. Click each artist to display a discography, the
artist biography, and music that you can either download for free or purchase.
267
Chapter 23: Enhancing Your Music Library

Music-matching in the Guide
You can take advantage of the free music-matching service built into Music
Guide, which finds music that suits your tastes based on your personal pref-
erences. Music Guide compares your downloads and purchases with those of
others who have downloaded or purchased music. Then it provides recom-
mendations based on matches.
To use the music-matching service, click the Recommendations button in the
Music Guide window, and then click the Sign Up Now button. Registration
takes place automatically, and MusicMatch Jukebox compares your music
with others that use the Music Guide. After a few minutes, the music-matching
service has enough information, and recommendations start to appear that
match the music others with similar tastes have bought or downloaded.
While installing MusicMatch Jukebox, the default setting is to opt into this
service — meaning that it’s automatically turned on. The service delivers 
recommendations based on personal preferences, but you might not want to
share your information. If you choose to continue to participate in this feature,
MusicMatch Jukebox periodically uploads your listening preferences so that
the Music Guide can make better recommendations. However, if you don’t
want to participate, turn off the Personalize Music Recommendations option
during installation.
Opting out of the Music Guide
To later opt out of this service, after installing the program, choose Options➪
Settings and click the General tab for the program’s general settings. Disable
the Upload User Preference Information Based on Listening Profile option. To
opt in at any time, you can turn this option back on. With this option enabled,
MusicMatch Jukebox uploads to Music Guide the songs that you’ve played
and compares them with other Music Guide users.

Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

Playing Streaming Radio in iTunes
Radio stations from nearly every part of the world are broadcasting on 
the Internet. You can tune into Japan-A-Radio for the top 40 hits in Japan, 
or Cable Radio UK from the south coast of England, or Radio Darvish for
Persian traditional music. You can also check out the local news and sports
from your hometown, no matter where you are. You can listen to talk radio
and music shows from all over the country and the world.
By radio, we really mean a streaming broadcast; of course, real radio stations
make use of this technology to broadcast their programs over the Internet. A
streaming broadcast sends audio to your computer in a protected stream of
bits over the Internet. Your computer starts playing the stream as soon as the
first set of bits arrive, and more sections are transferred while you listen, so
that you hear it as a continual stream. Broadcasters can use this technology
to continually transmit new content (like a radio station).
In addition, thousands of Web sites offer temporary streaming audio broad-
casts all the time. A rock group on tour can offer a broadcast of a special con-
cert, available for only one day. You might want to tune in weekly or monthly
broadcasts such as high-tech talk shows, news programs, documentaries, or
sporting events . . . the list is endless. You can even have access to private
broadcasts such as corporate board meetings.
You can’t record or save a song from a streamed broadcast without special
software. Nor can you play a streaming broadcast on your iPod. But you can
add your favorite stations to your iTunes music library to tune in quickly and
easily. You can also tune in any MP3 streaming broadcast if you know the Web
address.
iTunes offers a set links to radio stations on the Internet, so you might want
to try these first. Follow these steps:
1. Select the Radio option in the Source pane.
The iTunes window displays a list of categories of radio stations.
2. Click the Refresh button to retrieve the latest radio stations.
More Web radio stations are added all the time. The Refresh button in the
top-right corner of the iTunes window (taking the place of the Browse
button) connects iTunes to the Internet to retrieve the latest list of radio
stations for each category.
269
Chapter 23: Enhancing Your Music Library

3. Open a category to see a list of stations in that category.
Click the triangle next to a category name to open the list of radio
streams in that category. Some large radio stations offer more than 
one stream.
4. Select a stream and click the Play button.
To select a stream, click its name in the iTunes song list (actually,
radio station list because you selected Radio in the Source pane). 
Then click the iTunes Play button. Within seconds, you hear live 
radio off the Web.
If you use a dial-up modem connection to the Internet, you might want to
choose a stream with a bit rate of less than 56 Kbps for best results. The Bit
Rate column shows the bit rate for each stream.
iTunes creates a buffer for the audio stream so that you hear continuous
playback with fewer Internet-related hiccups than most Web radio software.
The buffer temporarily stores as much of the stream as possible, adding more
of the stream to the end of the buffer as you play the audio in the buffer. If
you hear stutters, gaps, or hiccups when playing a stream, set your buffer to
a larger size by choosing iTunes➪Preferences on a Mac/Edit➪Preferences on
a Windows PC. In the Preferences dialog, click the Advanced button and then
choose a size from the Streaming Buffer Size pop-up menu. Your choices are
Small, Medium, or Large (sorry, no X-Large).
Car radios offer preset stations activated by you pressing a button. Of course,
you first need to tune into the station of your choice to set that button. You
can save your radio station choices in an iTunes playlist, and the process is
just as easy:
1. Select a radio station stream.
2. Create a playlist or scroll the Source pane to an existing playlist.
See Chapter 10 to discover how to create a playlist.
3. Drag the stream name over the playlist name.
iTunes places the stream name in the playlist with a broadcast icon next
to it. You can click the playlist name and rearrange the playlist as you
want, dragging stream names as you would drag song names.
Drag as many steams as you like to as many playlists as you like. Radio
streams in your playlists play only if you are connected to the Internet.
To quickly create a playlist from selected radio streams, first select the streams
just as you would select multiple songs, and then choose File➪New Playlist
from Selection.
270
Part IV: Using Advanced Techniques 

You can tune into any broadcast on the Internet. All you need to know is the
Web address, also known as the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which is
the global address of documents and other resources on the Web. You can
find most URLs from a Web site or e-mail about a broadcast.
Follow these steps to add a Web broadcast to a playlist:
1. Choose Advanced➪Open Stream.
The Open Stream dialog appears, with a URL text field for typing a Web
address.
2. Type the exact, full URL of the stream.
Include the http:// prefix, as in http://64.236.34.141:80/
stream/1014.
If you’re connected to the Internet, iTunes automatically retrieves the
broadcast and places it at the end of your song list.
3. Click OK.
As of this writing, iTunes supports only MP3 broadcasts. You can find lots of
MP3 broadcasts from SHOUTcast (www.shoutcast.com) and Live365.com
(http://live365.com).
Changing the MusicMatch 
Jukebox Look and Feel
Like many Windows applications, MusicMatch Jukebox can change its look and
feel by adopting a different graphical user interface design. You can choose a
skin that provides the same set of buttons to perform tasks such as increasing
volume, opening the library, burning a music CD, and so on, but they are much
cooler looking than the usual MusicMatch Jukebox look (which is itself a skin).
Skins are changeable, and you can impress your friends by downloading new
ones from the MusicMatch site.
To the tune, “Lose This Skin” by The Clash, follow these steps to change the
MusicMatch Jukebox skin:
1. Right-click inside the media panel.
A contextual menu appears, as shown in Figure 23-2.
2. Choose a skin from the drop-down menu.
The pop-up menu offers skins that were downloaded or supplied with
MusicMatch Jukebox.
271
Chapter 23: Enhancing Your Music Library

After selecting the skin, MusicMatch Jukebox changes its look and feel 
automatically.
To download more skins from the Internet, first make sure that you’re con-
nected to the Internet, and then follow these steps:
1. Choose Download Skins from the View menu in MusicMatch Jukebox.
The Download Skins window appears with skins that you can download.
2. Click a skin in the Download Skins window.
The skin downloads and installs itself automatically, displaying a
progress window.
After installing the new skin, you can switch from the newly downloaded skin
to any other skin and back again, by right-clicking the media pane and choos-
ing the skin from the Skins pop-up menu.

 Setting up your iPod as an alarm clock
 Changing the iPod display settings
 Playing games
 Checking your calendar and sorting your contacts
 Recording voice memos on your iPod
 Customizing your iPod menus and settings
You might have purchased an iPod simply to listen to music, but those
thoughtful engineers at Apple who get to travel a lot with their iPods 
put a lot more into this device.
As we show in this chapter, your iPod keeps time, and you can use it as an
alarm clock to awaken you to your favorite music (or just a beep). In particular,
you can alleviate the boredom of travel with games, and check the time, date,
and month (in case you’re stranded for a long time). You can also check your
calendar and To-Do list, and look up contact names, addresses, and phone
numbers. You can even speak into your iPod and record dictation, conversa-
tions, or notes. You can also make your iPod more convenient to use while
traveling by customizing the iPod menu.
Setting Date, Time, and Sleep Functions 
All iPods running iPod software version 2.0 or newer have a digital clock that
doubles as an alarm clock and a sleep timer. To access the clock, choose
Extras➪Clock from the main menu.

To set the date and time, follow these steps:
1. Press the Menu button.
2. Choose Extras➪Clock.
The clock appears with menu selections underneath (except in older
models).
You can also set the date and time by choosing Settings➪Date & Time
from the main menu.
3. Select the Date & Time option.
The Date & Time menu appears.
4. Select the Set Time Zone option.
A list of time zones appears in alphabetical order.
5. Scroll the Time Zone list and select a time zone.
The Date & Time menu appears again.
6. Select the Set Date & Time option.
The Date & Time display appears with up and down arrow indicators
over the hour field, which is now highlighted.
7. Change the field setting using the scroll wheel.
Scroll clockwise to go forward and counterclockwise to go backward.
8. Press the Select button after scrolling to the appropriate setting.
The up and down arrow indicators move over to the minutes field,
which is now highlighted.
9. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 for each field of the date and time: minutes,
AM/PM, the calendar date, calendar month, and year.
When you finish setting the year by pressing the Select button, the Date &
Time menu appears again. You can select the Time option and press the
Select button to show the number of hours from 1 to 24 (military style). 
You can also select the Time option, and press the Select button to show the
time in the menu title of your iPod menus.
Just like a clock radio, you can set your iPod to play music for a while before
going to sleep. To set the sleep timer, select the Sleep Timer option from the
Clock menu. A list of intervals, from 0 (Off) to 120 minutes (2 hours) appears,
in 15-minute increments. You can select a time amount or the Off setting (at the
top of the list) to turn off the sleep timer. After the iPod shuts itself off (after
you hold down the pause button, or it remains idle for a few minutes and shuts
itself off), the preference for the Sleep Timer is reset to the default status, Off.
276
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Setting the Alarm Clock
Time is on your side with the iPod Alarm Clock function, which is located in
the iPod Clock menu (found only in newer models). To set the Alarm Clock,
follow these steps:
1. Choose Extras➪Clock➪Alarm Clock from the main menu.
The Alarm Clock menu appears, as shown in Figure 24-1.
2. Highlight the Alarm option and press the Select button (Off changes
to On).
3. Select the Time option.
The Alarm Time menu appears with up and down arrow indicators.
4. Change the time using the scroll wheel.
Scroll clockwise to go forward and counterclockwise to go backward.
5. Press the Select button after scrolling to the appropriate alarm time.
The Alarm Clock menu appears again.

Chapter 24: Sleeping with Your iPod

6. Select the Sound option in the Alarm Clock menu.
A list appears, with the Beep option at the top of the list, followed by
playlists on your iPod in alphabetical order.
7. Choose an option as the alarm sound, and then press the Select button.
If you choose Beep, the alarm beeps without the need for any headphones
or speakers. If you choose a playlist, when the alarm goes off, the playlist
plays until you stop it by pressing the Play/Pause button. Of course, you
need speakers or headphones to hear the music.
8. You can return to the main menu by pressing Menu until you see the
main menu.
When the alarm goes off, the playlist (or beep tone) plays until you stop
the alarm by pressing the Play/Pause button.
Choosing Display Settings
Your future may be so bright that you got to wear shades, but your iPod dis-
play might need a bit of an adjustment to see it better in bright sunlight or the
dark of night. With the iPod Settings menu, you can change the timer for the
backlight and also set the contrast for better visibility. Choose the Settings
menu from the iPod main menu.
Backlight timer
Ordinarily, your iPod display’s backlight turns on when you press a button or
use the scroll wheel, and then it turns off after a short amount of time. On
third-generation iPods, the backlight also lights up the iPod buttons.
You can set the backlight to remain on for a certain interval of time. Choose
Settings from the iPod main menu and then select Backlight Timer. A menu
appears — 2 seconds, 5 seconds, 10 seconds, and so on. Select one by scrolling
to highlight the selection, and then press the Select button.
The backlight drains the iPod battery; the longer you set the interval, the
more frequently you need to recharge the battery.
You can turn off the backlight at any time by pressing and holding down the
Menu button. You can also turn off the backlight and the iPod by pressing
down and holding the Play/Pause button. The backlight turns on when you
press any button or use the scroll wheel. You can also turn on the backlight
by selecting Backlight from the iPod main menu.
278
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

You can also set the backlight to always be on or always be off. If you set it to
always be off, the backlight doesn’t turn on automatically when you press any
button or use the scroll wheel. You can still turn it on, however, by pressing
and holding the Menu button or by selecting Backlight from the main menu.
The backlight isn’t that useful when the display is tilted toward direct sun-
light. As we discuss in the next section, it’s better to adjust the contrast to
get better visibility in bright lighting conditions.
Don’t be alarmed if your backlight turns itself on at midnight for a brief flash.
The iPod is just setting its internal clock. If you find this annoying, turn the
Backlight Timer to off.
Contrast for better visibility
You can set the contrast of the iPod display to make the black characters
appear sharper against the display background. You might need to adjust the
contrast after a sharp temperature difference freezes or bakes your iPod. If you
kept your iPod in your car overnight in the cold, or even in direct sunlight for
a time, the contrast can change so much that you can’t see your iPod display.
Allow the iPod to warm up (slowly — don’t use the oven or microwave) if it’s
cold, or cool down if the display is hot, and then adjust the contrast.
To adjust the contrast, choose Settings from the iPod main menu, and then
choose Contrast from the Settings menu. The Contrast screen appears with a
slider that shows the contrast setting, which ranges from low contrast (a black-
and-white dot) to high contrast (a full black dot). Scroll clockwise to increase
the contrast (toward the black dot) and counterclockwise to decrease the
contrast (toward the black-and-white dot).
If you accidentally set the contrast too dark or too light, you can reset it to
the halfway point between too dark and too light by pressing and holding
down the Menu button for at least four seconds.
Playing Games
The games that come with the iPod — Brick, Parachute, and Solitaire — are a
bit dorky for the information age, but hey, they’re extras. Music Quiz, on the
other hand, is a cool way to test your knowledge of your music library.
To find the games, choose Extras➪Games (Extras➪Game on older iPods).
And of course you can listen to music while you play.
279
Chapter 24: Sleeping with Your iPod

Brick and Parachute
Brick is like the original version of Breakout for the Atari. To access this game,
choose Extras➪Games➪Brick (Extras➪Game on older iPods), and press the
Select button to start the game. Move the paddle from side to side along the
bottom of the display by scrolling with the scroll wheel. You get a point for
each brick you knock out. If you break out — knock out all the bricks — you
move up a level in the game, and the game starts again.
Parachute is a crude shoot-’em-up game where you play the role of an antiair-
craft gunner. Choose Extras➪Games➪Parachute, and press the Select button
to start the game. You pivot the gun at the bottom with the scroll wheel. Press
the Select button to fire on helicopters and paratroopers. Don’t let the para-
troopers reach the ground, or else they’ll heave grenades at you. War is hell.
Solitaire
Rather than playing the card game ’til one, with a deck of 51, try the iPod 
version of Solitaire (known as “Klondike”). Choose Extras➪Games➪Solitaire,
and press the Select button to start the game. To move cards, place the hand
pointer over a card by scrolling the scroll wheel, and press the Select button
to select the card. Then scroll again to move the hand pointer to the new loca-
tion for the card, and press Select to place the card at that position. To deal
out another round of three cards, move the hand pointer over the card deck
in the top-left corner of the display, and press the Select button. After going
through an entire deck, the game places the remaining cards into a new deck
so that you can continue dealing cards. The game improves considerably in a
smoke-filled room with take-out pizza nearby; gangsters are optional.
Music Quiz
Music Quiz tests your knowledge of your music library and is probably the
greatest time-waster of them all. The game plays the first few seconds of a
song picked at random from your iPod. Choose Extras➪Games➪Music Quiz,
put on your headphones or connect your iPod to speakers, and press the
Select button to start the game. As the song plays, you have ten seconds to
pick the song title from a list of five titles. If you choose the wrong title, the
game displays Incorrect! and moves on to the next one. If you choose the
right title, you gain points and move on to the next one. (“Life’s a Long Song”
by Jethro Tull would be appropriate.)

Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Checking Your Calendar
Imagine a musician going backstage after a performance and meeting a pro-
moter who says he can get him ten more gigs if he can confirm the dates right
now. This musician happens to carry around an iPod, and amid the backstage
craziness, he scrolls through his calendar for the entire year, finding all the
details he needs about gigs and recording sessions, right down to the minute,
including travel directions to each gig. “No problem,” the musician says.
Your iPod has a standard calendar that you can view by choosing Extras➪
Calendars➪All. Select a calendar and then use the scroll wheel to scroll
through the days of the calendar. Select an event to see the event’s details.
Press the Next and Previous buttons to skip to the next or previous month.
To see your To-Do list, choose Extras➪Calendars➪To Do.
If your calendar events use alarms, you can turn on the iPod’s calendar
alarms. Choose Extras➪Calendars➪Alarms. Select Alarms once to set the
alarm to Beep, or once again to set it to Silent (so that only the message for
the alarm appears), or one more time to set if to Off. (The Alarms choices
cycle from Beep to Silent to Off and then back to Beep.)
Calendars are far more useful if you enter your personal information as we
describe in Chapter 26.
Sorting Your Contacts 
The most likely bits of information that you might need on the road are some-
one’s phone number or address (or both). The iPod stores up to 1,000 contacts
right alongside your music. To see how to put your personal contacts into your
iPod, see Chapter 26.
The iPod contact list is sorted automatically, and the iPod displays contact
names in alphabetical order when you select Extras➪Contacts. You can choose
whether to display contacts by last or first name. Choose Settings➪Contacts➪
Display; then press the Select button in the scrolling pad for each option:
 First Last: Displays the contact list by first name and the last name, as in
Ringo Starr.
 Last, First: Displays the contact list by last name followed by a comma
and the first name, as in McCartney, Paul.
281
Chapter 24: Sleeping with Your iPod

You can also change how the contacts sort so that you don’t have to look 
up people by their first names (which can be time-consuming with so many
friends named Elvis). The sort operation uses the entire name, but you
decide whether to use the first name or the surname first. Choose Settings➪
Contacts➪Sort. Press the Select button in the scrolling pad for each option:
 First Last: Sorts the contact list by first name, followed by the last name,
so that Mick Jagger sorts under Mick (after Mick Abrahams but before
Mick Taylor).
 Last, First: Sorts the contacts by last name, followed by the first name,
so that Brian Jones sorts under Jones. (Jones, Brian appears after Jones,
Alice but before Jones, Norah.)
Speaking into Your iPod
Do you record conversations and interviews on the road? Throw out that
tape recorder. Your iPod can record hundreds of hours of voice-quality
memos, meetings, notes, and interviews with a touch of a button. All you
need is an accessory that includes a microphone, such as the tiny Belkin 
iPod Voice Recorder (www.belkin.com), $59.95, which fits right on top of
your iPod. The voice memos are stored on your iPod where you can review
them immediately using the built-in speaker of the accessory or your head-
phones or speakers. Even better, the voice memos are automatically trans-
ferred to your iTunes library for archiving or reviewing on your computer.
The Belkin iPod Voice Recorder attaches to the remote connector on the top of
full-size third-generation and fourth-generation iPods (updated by version 2.1
of the iPod software or newer).
Recording voice memos
To record voice memos, connect the Belkin iPod Voice Recorder to the iPod
and choose Extras➪Voice Memos➪Record Now. The iPod displays the Record
screen. Press the Play/Pause button to begin recording, and hold the iPod as
you would a microphone, with the Voice Recorder pointing at the sound source
(or your mouth for your voice). The green LED on the Voice Recorder turns on
when you are recording. You can pause the recording by pressing the Play/
Pause button again.
282
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

When you finish recording, press the Menu button. The audio files for voice
memos are stored on your iPod in the Recordings folder, using the date and
time of the recording as the filename.
Playing back voice memos
To play back a voice memo, choose Extras➪Voice Memos and choose the voice
memo from the list. (The Voice Memos menu doesn’t appear unless you have
already connected the Belkin Voice Recorder at least once.) Then select Play
(or press the Play/Pause button).
The voice memo plays just like any other song on your iPod — you can press
Play/Pause to pause playback, and press it again to resume. You hear the
playback in the Belkin Voice Recorder’s tiny speaker, attach headphones to
your iPod, or connect your iPod to a home stereo, car stereo, or self-powered
speakers.
You can play music through the Belkin Voice Recorder’s speaker by connect-
ing the accessory to your iPod and playing. This comes in handy if you set
your iPod as an alarm clock to play a music playlist; you can hear music when
you wake up without having to connect the iPod to speakers. See the earlier
section, “Setting the Alarm Clock.”
Managing voice memos in iTunes
Just like your music, your voice memos synchronize automatically with your
iTunes library if you set your iPod to update automatically. (See Chapter 11
to discover how to set your iPod to update automatically.) iTunes stores the
voice memos in the library and creates a playlist named Voice Memos, as
shown in Figure 24-2, so that you can find them easily.
If you update your iPod manually, you can drag voice memo files directly
from the Recordings folder to your hard drive, or drag and drop them over
the iTunes window. Note: The iPod must already be enabled as a hard drive.
(Flip to Chapter 25 to see how to enable your iPod as a hard drive.)
Voice memos are stored as WAV files. If you want to archive them in a format
that takes up less hard drive space, convert them by using the AAC or MP3
encoder, as we describe in Chapter 20.

Chapter 24: Sleeping with Your iPod

Customizing the Menu and Settings
When traveling or using your iPod in situations or environments where porta-
bility is important, you might want to customize your iPod menu and display to
make doing things easier, such as selecting certain albums, displaying the time,
displaying menus with backlighting turned on longer than usual, and so on.
The Settings menu in the iPod main menu offers ways to customize your iPod
experience by changing the main menu to have more choices. Choose the
Settings menu from the main menu, and then choose Main Menu. The iPod
displays a list of menus; each menu is set to either On or Off. On means the
menu appears in the iPod main menu; Off means the menu does not appear
in the main menu. (Don’t worry; the menus are still where they are supposed
to be. Turning one to On simply adds it to the main menu as well.)
Other ways to customize your experience include setting the clicker sound
and setting the language to use for the menus. The options in the Settings
menu include
 About: This displays information about the iPod, including number of
songs, how much space is used, how much space is available, the soft-
ware version in use, and the serial number.
 Main Menu: This allows you to customize the main menu on iPods that
use iPod software 2.0 or newer. For example, you can add items from
other menus, such as Artists or Songs from the Music menu (Browse
menu in older iPods), to the main menu.
 Backlight Timer: You can set the backlight to remain on for a certain
amount of time by pressing a button or using the scroll wheel. Specify
two seconds, five seconds, and so on. You can also set it to always be on.

The backlight drains the iPod battery; the longer you set the interval,
the more you need to recharge the battery.
 Contrast: You can set the contrast of the iPod display by using the scroll
wheel to increase or decrease the slider in the Contrast screen. If you
accidentally set the contrast too dark, you can reset it by holding down
the Menu button for at least four seconds.
 Clicker: When this setting is on, you hear a click when you press a
button; when it’s off, you don’t hear a click.
 Language: This sets the language used in all the menus. See Chapter 1
for how to set the language.
 Legal: This displays the legal message that accompanies Apple 
products.
 Reset All Settings: This resets all the Settings menu settings in your
iPod, returning them to the state they were in originally. However, your
music and data files on the iPod are not disturbed. This is not the same
as resetting (and restarting) the iPod software itself; Reset All Settings
simply returns all settings to their defaults. See Chapter 1 for how to
reset the iPod itself.

Chapter 25
Using the iPod as a Hard Drive
In This Chapter
 Mounting your iPod as a hard drive for a Mac or a Windows PC
 Copying notes and text files to your iPod
 Storing photos on your iPod
 Storing Mac OS X on your iPod for emergencies
You have a device in your pocket that can play weeks of music, sort your
contacts, remind you of events, wake you up in the morning, and tuck
you in at night. Did you also know that you can use your iPod to keep a safe
backup of your most important files?
You read that right. Mac users can even put a version of the Mac system on the
iPod in case of emergencies. (Unfortunately, you can’t do this with Windows.)
Apple doesn’t recommend putting the Mac system on the iPod because using
the iPod as a startup hard drive might make your iPod too hot from overuse,
but you can do it. You can also copy applications and utility programs that
you might need on the road or even copy your entire User folder to the iPod
if you have room after putting music on it.
But that’s not all. With full-size third-generation and fourth-generation iPods
(which can connect with the dock-type connector), you can use accessories
to extend your iPod’s capabilities. For example, you can use the Belkin Media
Reader for iPod to store photos from digital camera memory cards. There’s
even software, such as Pod2Go, that offers synchronized feeds that supply
your iPod with news, weather forecasts, and even sections of Web pages that
you can read on the iPod screen.
The key to these capabilities is the fact that the iPod serves as an external
hard drive. After you mount the iPod on your Mac or Windows desktop, you
can use it as a hard drive, but do so sparingly.

We don’t recommend using the iPod regularly as a hard drive to launch appli-
cations. The iPod is designed more for sustained playback of music, and you
can eventually burn out the device by using it to launch applications all the
time. Instead, use it as an external hard drive for backing up and copying files,
and use it in emergency situations for starting up the system.
Mounting the iPod as a Hard Drive
Your iPod can double as an external hard drive. And like any hard drive, you
can transfer files and applications from your computer to your iPod and take
them with you wherever you go. The iPod is smart enough to keep your files
separate from your music collection so that you don’t accidentally erase them
when you update your music. And because your iPod is with you, it’s as safe
as you are.
The iPod, as shipped, is formatted as a Macintosh hard drive and can be con-
nected to any Mac. When you connect it to Windows, the iPod is reformatted
as a Windows hard drive. You can then connect it to any Windows PC or any
Mac. (Macs can read hard drives that are formatted for PCs.)
Setting up the hard drive iPod on a Mac
To use your iPod as an external hard drive on a Mac, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your Mac.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences dialog opens, as shown in Figure 25-1.
4. Select the Enable Disk Use option and click OK.
The Enable Disk Use option is available if your iPod is set to automatically
update. You must select this option to use your iPod as a hard drive. If you
already set your iPod to manual updating (as we describe in Chapter 11),
this option is grayed out because it isn’t needed — setting the iPod to
update manually automatically enables you to use it as a hard drive.
5. Open the iPod icon in the Finder to see its contents.
The iPod hard drive opens up to show three folders — Calendars,
Contacts, and Notes, as you can see in Figure 25-2. You can add new 
folders, rename your new folders, and generally use the iPod as a hard
drive, but don’t rename these three folders; they link directly to the
Calendar, Contacts, and Notes functions on the iPod.
288
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

6. Optional: Drag files or folders to the iPod window.
To keep data organized, create new folders on the iPod, and then drag
files and folders that you want to copy to the newly created folders.
7. Before disconnecting the iPod, eject the iPod from the system.
Click the Eject button next to the iPod name in the Finder or drag the
iPod icon to the Trash.
After ejecting the iPod, its display shows the OK to disconnect message on
older models, or the main menu. You can then disconnect the iPod from its
dock or disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an
iPod before ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod. (If you do, head to
Chapter 1.)

Chapter 25: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

To delete files and folders from the iPod, drag them to the Trash just like an
external hard drive.
Don’t use a hard drive utility program, such as Disk Utility or Drive Setup, to
erase or format the iPod’s hard drive. If you erase your iPod’s hard drive in
this way, it might be unable to play music.
To see how much free space is left on the iPod, you can use the Finder. Select
the iPod icon on the desktop, and then choose File➪Show Info. You can also
choose Settings➪About from the iPod’s main menu.
Setting up the hard drive iPod 
on a Windows PC with iTunes
You can set up your iPod to use as an external hard drive on a Windows PC
by using iTunes. If you use iTunes, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your computer.
2. Select the iPod name in the iTunes Source pane.
3. Click the iPod Options button.
The iPod Preferences dialog opens, as shown in Figure 25-3.
4. Select the Enable Disk Use option and click OK.
The Enable Disk Use option is available if your iPod is set to automatically
update. You must select this option to use your iPod as a hard drive. If you
already set your iPod to manual updating (as we describe in Chapter 11),
this option is grayed out because it isn’t needed — setting the iPod to
update manually automatically enables you to use it as a hard drive.

5. Double-click the iPod icon in the My Computer or Windows Explorer
window to see its contents.
If you open the My Computer window, the iPod appears as an external
hard drive, as shown in Figure 25-4. The iPod in the figure is named
Journeyman and assigned to drive G. Windows automatically assigns 
the iPod hard drive to a Windows drive letter.
The iPod hard drive opens up to show three folders — Calendars,
Contacts, and Notes. You can add new folders, rename your new folders,
and generally use the iPod as a hard drive, but don’t rename these three
folders; they link directly to the Calendar, Contacts, and Notes functions
on the iPod.
6. Optional: Copy files or folders to the iPod.
To keep data organized, create new folders on the iPod, and then copy
files and folders to the newly created folders by using the drag-and-drop
method in the My Computer window or Windows Explorer, or by copying
and pasting.
7. Before disconnecting the iPod, eject the iPod from Windows.
Right-click the iPod name or icon and choose Eject from the shortcut
menu. You can do this from within iTunes by clicking the Eject button
next to the iPod’s name in the Source pane.

After ejecting the iPod, it displays the OK to disconnect message on older
models, or the main menu. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or
disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before
ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod. (If you do, head to Chapter 1.)
To delete files and folders from the iPod, select the filename and press Delete,
or choose File➪Delete from the Windows Explorer menu, just like you do on
your internal hard drive.
Don’t use the Windows formatting utility or third-party hard drive utility pro-
gram to erase or format the iPod’s hard drive. If you erase the hard drive in
your iPod in this way, it may be unable to play music.
To see how much free space is left on the iPod, select the iPod icon in 
My Computer and choose File➪Properties. You can also choose Settings➪
About from the iPod’s main menu.
Setting up the hard drive iPod on a
Windows PC with MusicMatch Jukebox
If you use MusicMatch Jukebox, you can enable the iPod to work as a hard
drive in Windows by using MusicMatch Jukebox or the iPod Manager utility
installed with MusicMatch Jukebox. Follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to your PC and wait for MusicMatch Jukebox to
recognize it.
Your iPod should appear in the PortablesPlus window under the
Attached Portable Devices folder. If the PortablesPlus window isn’t 
yet open, choose File➪Send to Portable Device.
2. Select the iPod, click the Options button, and then click the iPod tab.
3. Select the Enable Disk Mode option.
4. Click OK to close the Options window.
You can use the iPod Manager utility, installed with iPod for Windows and
MusicMatch Jukebox, to change iPod settings, launch the software updater,
check the Apple site for updates, and change the home application for the
iPod (set to MusicMatch Jukebox by default). To use iPod Manager, follow
these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to the Windows PC.
292
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

2. Launch iPod Manager.
To launch iPod Manager, you can right-click the iPod icon and choose iPod
Manager from the shortcut menu, or open iPod Manager directly by choos-
ing Start Menu➪All Programs➪iPod➪iPod Manager. The iPod Manager
dialog appears, as shown in Figure 25-5.
3. Select the Enable Disk Mode option in the iPod Manager dialog.
4. Click OK to close the iPod Manager dialog.
To see how much free space is left on your iPod, check the iPod Disk area in
the iPod Manager dialog, which shows you the total amount of storage space
on your iPod and the amount already used.
You can now open your iPod in the My Computer window to see its contents
and use it as an external hard drive, just like any storage device connected to
your Windows PC. The iPod is assigned a drive letter, such as E. (The letter
chosen depends on how many devices you already have connected to the PC.)
When you finish using your iPod as a hard drive, eject the iPod by using one
of the following ways:
 Click the Eject button in MusicMatch Jukebox.
 Use the Safe Remove Hardware icon in the system tray.
Figure 25-5:

293
Chapter 25: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

Due to the way iPod for Windows works with MusicMatch Jukebox, use only
one of the above methods to eject your iPod. Do not use the Eject option on
the shortcut menu that pops up if you right-click the iPod icon in the My
Computer window. This Eject option doesn’t work with iPod for Windows 
and MusicMatch Jukebox.
To eject your iPod by using MusicMatch Jukebox, follow these steps:
1. Close any application other than MusicMatch Jukebox (such as iPod
Manager) that is using the iPod.
2. Select iPod in the MusicMatch Jukebox PortablesPlus window.
3. Click the Eject button in the lower-left corner of the MusicMatch
Jukebox PortablesPlus window.
4. An alert dialog appears, click Yes.
It takes about 15 seconds before the iPod can be disconnected. The
PortablesPlus window displays the message Ejecting iPod. Please
wait . . . until it finishes, and then it displays It is now safe to
disconnect iPod.
5. Wait until the iPod displays OK to disconnect or its main menu, and
then disconnect the iPod from the computer.
Follow these steps to eject your iPod by using the Safely Remove Hardware
icon in the Windows system tray:
1. Close any applications (such as MusicMatch Jukebox and iPod
Manager) that are still using the iPod.
2. In the bottom-right corner of the screen, click the Safely Remove
Hardware icon.
The Safely Remove Hardware shortcut menu appears.
3. Select the Apple IEEE 1394 (FireWire) device if you use FireWire, 
or the USB Mass Storage device if you use USB, from the short-
cut menu.
4. An alert dialog appears. Click OK.
5. Wait until the iPod displays OK to disconnect or its main menu, and
then disconnect the iPod from the computer.
Never disconnect an iPod before ejecting it. If you do, you might have to reset
your iPod, as we describe in Chapter 1.
294
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Adding Notes and Text
You can add text notes to your iPod so that you can view them on the iPod
display — all sorts of notes, such as driving directions, weather information,
or even news items. If you just use your iPod for music, you might want notes
about the music. This feature works with iPods that run iPod software 2.0 or
newer (including iPod mini and third- and fourth-generation iPods that use
the dock connector).
Using the Notes folder
In a perfect world you could rip audio CDs and also capture all the information
in the liner notes — the descriptions of who played which instruments, where
the CD was produced, and other minute detail. Then, while sharing your iPod
music with others, you could view the liner notes on the iPod screen whenever
a question arises about the music.
You can almost achieve the same result by typing some of the liner notes or any
text you want (or copy or export song information from iTunes, as we describe
in Chapter 14) into a word processing program, such as TextEdit on a Mac or
NotePad on a Windows PC. You can then save the document as a text-only file
(with the filename extension .txt) and drag it to the Notes folder of the iPod.
Documents must be saved as text-only files to be viewed on the iPod display.
If you use a word processor, such as Microsoft Word, choose File➪Save As,
and select the Text Only option (or the Text Only with Line Breaks option)
from the Save As Type drop-down list in Windows or the Format pop-up
menu on a Mac. Each text file must be smaller than 4K.
Text files in the Notes folder are organized by filename. You can view these
notes files by choosing Extras➪Notes. Make sure that you name your notes
with descriptive filenames so that you can easily scroll the list of notes files
to find the liner notes for the album you’re listening to.
Your iPod can also display a folder hierarchy in the Notes folder, allowing you
to organize your notes by creating folders (using the Finder with your iPod
mounted as a hard drive) and putting notes files within the folders in the
Notes folder. The size of any single note is limited to 4K; any text beyond 4K
is truncated. You can transfer up to 1,000 notes. Your notes can include basic
HTML tags (used on Web pages) such as paragraph markers (<P> and </P>)
and line break (<BR>).
295
Chapter 25: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

Adding news feeds, books, and Web pages
Do you want the latest news, weather, sports scores, or driving directions
available at the touch of a button of your iPod? Enterprising software entre-
preneurs have moved in to fill the vacuum left by Apple with accessories 
that provide displayable text on your iPod screen, such as the following:
 Pod2Go (available at www.kainjow.com/pod2go/website) for the Mac
offers synchronized feeds for news, weather forecasts, movie listings,
stock quotes, horoscopes, sections of Web pages, and driving directions. 
 NewsMac 3 (available at www.thinkmac.co.uk/newsmac), also for the
Mac, lets you keep tabs on world news Web sites and lets you transfer
entire Web pages. 
 EphPod for Windows (available at www.ephpod.com) also lets you
update your iPod with news, weather, and other information updates.
 Book2Pod (available at www.tomsci.com/book2pod) is a shareware
program for the Mac that allows you to read entire books on your iPod
display. There’s also a similar shareware program for Windows called
iPodLibrary (available at www.ipodlibrary.com). 
 You can also take advantage of the Notes folder and other iPod features
by using some of the handy AppleScripts provided for iTunes and the
iPod, which you can download from the Apple site (www.apple.com/
applescript/ipod).
Storing Photos on Your iPod
If you’re traveling with your digital camera and your iPod, you can shoot all the
pictures you want without worrying about filling up your camera’s memory
card. Shoot all the pictures you want, and then connect the camera to your full-
size iPod with the Belkin Media Reader for iPod, and transfer the photos to your
iPod. Then delete the pictures from your camera’s memory card and go snap
some more. You could travel for weeks on end, shooting thousands of photos
in locations around the world without running out of space in your iPod.
The Belkin Media Reader for iPod connects to the iPod’s FireWire dock con-
nector and transfers photos quickly to the iPod hard drive, which can hold
hundreds or even thousands of photos (depending on how much music is
already stored on the iPod). Available from the Apple Store, this accessory
works only with full-size iPod models with dock connectors.
296
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To transfer the photos to the iPhoto library on a Mac, mount the iPod as a
hard drive, as we describe earlier in this chapter. Then import the photos by
dragging the files directly from the iPod hard drive and dropping them over
the iPhoto window.
Taking Your Mac System on the Road
Although the iPod is the road warrior’s dream weapon for combating road
fatigue and boredom, if you update and maintain its hard drive contents
wisely, it can also be invaluable as a tool for providing quick information 
and for saving your computer from disaster. Don’t let hard drive space go 
to waste: Fill up your iPod and let the iPod be your road manager. You can
put your most important applications, utilities, and files on the iPod hard
drive as a backup.
You can even use your iPod to save your Mac in a system crisis. Although
this operation isn’t officially supported by Apple, you can load the iPod with
a minimally configured Mac system and then use the iPod to start up your
Mac. Depending on the size of your iPod, you should be able to fit both a 
minimal system and a considerable amount of music on the iPod.
Life on the road can be hazardous to your laptop’s hard drive, and if any 
portion of the hard drive containing system files is damaged, your system
might not start up. When this happens, you ordinarily use the installation
CDs to start the Mac, scan and fix the hard drive trouble spots, and reinstall
the Mac operating system. With your iPod, you can at least start the Mac and
scan and fix the hard drive trouble spots, and you can also use any other files
or applications that you previously put on your iPod.
Mac models introduced after January 2003 can’t start up with Mac OS 9, so
you need to save Mac OS X to your iPod unless you use an older Mac.
To get the most functionality from your iPod, make sure that you have the
latest version of iPod software. To find out which version of software your
iPod uses, choose Settings➪About from the iPod main menu. To update 
your iPod software to the latest version, see Chapter 28.
To copy files and applications to your iPod, first mount the iPod as a hard
drive, as we describe earlier in this chapter.
297
Chapter 25: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

Installing Mac OS 9
To install a custom version of OS 9 on your iPod, connect your iPod as a hard
drive, and then follow these steps:
1. Insert your Mac OS 9 installation CD into your Mac and follow the
directions to start up the installation process.
You have to restart the Mac with the installation CD while holding down
C to start the computer from the CD.
2. When the installer asks you to select a destination, select the iPod
hard drive.
3. After the installation finishes, quit the installation program.
That’s all you have to do — the installer does everything for you.
To start up a Mac from an iPod that holds Mac OS 9, connect the iPod, hold
down Option, and choose Restart from the Apple menu (or if your system is
already hosed, use the Power button to reboot while holding down Option).
Eventually, as the Mac resets and scans itself for any startup drives, all the
startup drives appear as icons in a row, with a right-pointing arrow underneath
the icons. Click the icon representing the iPod hard drive, and then click the
right-pointing arrow to start the system from that drive.
Installing Mac OS X
To install a custom version of OS X older than version 10.2 on your iPod
(such as 10.0 or 10.1), connect your iPod as a hard drive, as we describe 
earlier in this chapter, and then follow these steps:
1. Insert your Mac OS X installation CD into your Mac and follow the
directions to start up the installation process.
You have to restart the Mac with the installation CD while holding down
C to start the computer from the CD.
2. When the installer asks you to select a destination, choose the iPod
hard drive.
Don’t use the option to erase and format the hard drive, because the
hard drive of your iPod is specially formatted for playing music, and for-
matting it in this manner prevents it from playing music again. So don’t
format it! If you format or erase the iPod’s hard drive by mistake, you
must restore it to its factory condition, as we describe in Chapter 28.
298
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

3. Specify a custom installation rather than a standard installation.
To make sure that you don’t use up too much hard drive space on your
iPod, choose a custom installation of OS X. In the custom installation
section, choose only the languages that you need. These language
options take up a lot of space, and you probably don’t need them.
4. After installation finishes and the Mac restarts from the iPod, continue
through the setup procedure, and then use Software Update in System
Preferences to update the Mac system on your iPod.
Most likely a lot of system updates are waiting for you — updates released
after the date of your installation CDs. Take the time to update your
system because these updates might make a difference in how your
computer performs with certain applications.
To install a custom version of OS X version 10.2 (Jaguar) on your iPod, 
you need to use Carbon Copy Cloner, a $5 shareware program (available 
from www.bombich.com/software/ccc.html). Although you could clone
your system by using the Unix ditto command in the Terminal window 
of Mac OS X, this process is tedious and you could easily make a mistake.
Carbon Copy Cloner lets you specify what parts of the system you don’t 
need cloned, and you can use its Preferences dialog to make the target disk
(your iPod) bootable.
To install a custom version of OS X version 10.3 (Panther) on your iPod, 
connect your iPod as a hard drive, and then use the Disk Utility program 
supplied with OS X. (It’s in the Utilities folder inside your Applications 
folder.) Using Disk Utility, drag the icon for a source hard drive with a 
version of OS X 10.3 to the Source text box in the Disk Utility dialog, and 
then drag your iPod hard drive icon into the Destination text box. Then 
click Restore, and the program does everything for you. 
To start up a Mac from an iPod that runs Mac OS X, connect the iPod, 
hold down Option, and choose Restart from the Apple menu (or if your
system is already hosed, use the Power button to reboot while holding 
down Option). Eventually, as the Mac resets itself and scans itself for any
startup drives, all the startup drives appear as icons in a row, with a right-
pointing arrow underneath the icons. Click the icon representing the iPod
hard drive, and then click the right-pointing arrow to start the system from
that drive.
While you’re at it, copy the Disk Utility program to your iPod so that you can
repair any Mac’s hard drive by using your iPod as the startup drive.
299
Chapter 25: Using the iPod as a Hard Drive

Removing the system
Removing Mac OS 9 from an iPod is easy: Simply drag the System Folder from
the iPod hard drive to the Trash when your iPod is connected as a hard drive.
Removing Mac OS X isn’t as easy because OS X installs hidden files and direc-
tories, and there is no easy way to drag them to the Trash. (Perhaps that’s why
Apple doesn’t support this feature.) The quickest and easiest way to remove
OS X from an iPod is to restore the iPod, as we describe in Chapter 28. Restore
erases and reformats the iPod to its original factory condition. Be sure to copy
any important files stored on your iPod before doing this. Although all your
music and files are erased in this one step, it’s much easier to then add your
music from iTunes, your calendars and contacts, and your files, than it is to
try to delete files associated with OS X. Restore, and then copy everything
back to your iPod as needed.

 Storing contacts in Address Book (Mac)
 Storing contacts in Outlook and Microsoft Address Book (Windows or Mac)
Your iPod is capable of helping you manage your activities on the road to
the point where it competes in some respects with personal digital assis-
tants (PDAs). You can manage your address book, calendar, and To-Do list for
the road all on your computer, and then update or synchronize your iPod to
have all the information that you need for viewing and playback. As a result, you
might not ever need an additional PDA — especially if you prefer typing data
into your computer before loading it into the device. Your iPod is a player —
not just in the world of music, but also in the world of personal productivity.
The most likely bit of information that you might need on the road is a phone
number, an address, or information related to an event or calendar appoint-
ment. Your iPod can store your personal information right alongside your
music so that the information is available at your fingertips. After entering
and managing your personal information on your computer, you can then
copy the information to your iPod or synchronize with information already
on your iPod.
The iPod accepts industry-standard iCalendar and vCalendar files for calen-
dars and To-Do lists, which you can export from most applications that offer
calendars and To-Do lists. It also accepts industry-standard vCards, or virtual
business cards, which are records containing contact information for people,
including physical addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and so on.
Again, most applications that offer address books or contact lists can export
vCards.

If you’re a Mac user, you have it easy: You can use the free iCal and Address
Book applications and automatically synchronize the information with your
iPod calendar and contact list with iSync (see Chapter 27). Mac users can also
choose other applications and export (or drag) the information to your iPod. 
If you’re a Windows user, you have a variety of choices for managing contacts
and calendar information, and you also have choices of third-party utilities for
putting the information on an iPod, as well as the tried-and-true technique of
exporting (or dragging) information to the iPod.
This chapter shows you how to enter your personal information into the
computer by using Address Book and iCal (on a Mac) or Microsoft Outlook
and Microsoft Address Book (on a Windows PC).
Keeping Appointments 
with iCal on the Mac
iCal, the free desktop calendar application that you can download from Apple’s
software download page (www.info.apple.com/support/downloads.html),
creates calendars that you can copy to your iPod. iCal requires Mac OS X ver-
sion 10.2.3 or newer. You can create custom calendars for different activities,
such as home, office, road tours, exercise and diet schedules, mileage logs, and
so on. You can view them separately or all together. After editing your calen-
dars on the Mac, you can synchronize your iPod to have the same calendars
by using iSync, as we describe in Chapter 27.
If you use another application to manage your personal calendar, you might
still want to use iCal just to transfer your calendar information to the iPod
painlessly. You can import calendars from other applications that support
the iCal or vCal format, such as Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, and
Palm Desktop. When your information is in iCal, you can synchronize your
entire calendar with your iPod by using iSync.
Launch iCal by double-clicking the iCal application or clicking its icon in the
Mac OS X Dock. iCal displays a calendar, as shown in Figure 26-1, and you can
switch the view from an entire month to just one week or one day by clicking
the Day or Week buttons at the bottom of the window.
iCal starts you off with two calendars: Home and Work. Their names have
check marks next to them in the upper-left corner of the iCal window, indicat-
ing that both are visible, and they’re merged into the calendar view. To see
only your Home calendar, deselect the Work option in the Calendars pane 
on the left, and vice-versa. It’s easy to set up appointments and events for
either calendar.

Setting up an appointment or event
Some appointments and events are a drag, and some are fun, but either way you
can drag your mouse to create one. Click the Week button at the bottom of the
window to see just an entire week, and then click and drag over a period of time
to create an appointment. You can choose File➪New Event to do the same thing.
To see the details of an event or appointment, do one of these things:
 Double-click the event or appointment.
 Click the event or appointment to select it, and then click the i button in
the lower-right corner.
 Click the event or appointment to select it, and then choose Window➪
Show Info.
The detail for the event or appointment appears in the info drawer that sticks
out on the right side of the iCal window, as shown in Figure 26-2.
In the info drawer, you can type over the filler “New Event” and “location” text,
change the date and time, add attendees, specify the status and whether the
event or appointment should be repeated, and so on. You can add type a note
in the Notes section at the bottom and assign the event to a specific calendar
(in this case, the Home calendar). If you have created custom calendars within
iCal (as we describe in “Creating a custom calendar”), select the calendar that
you want to add the event to from the Calendar pop-up menu. You can set the
event to automatically repeat every day, week, month, or year by using the
Repeat pop-up menu.

iPod as PDA: You can play, but you can’t type
We could never get used to tiny portable com-
puters and PDAs. We use computers for all our
information needs, but we’ve never really gone
smaller than a laptop because the keyboards on
smaller devices are too small for touch-typists.
People who use the hunt-and-peck method of
typing can quickly adapt to using forefingers and
thumbs or a stylus to type reasonably well on a
cell phone or PDA. However, PDAs can be hard to
use for people who are trained to hold their hands
a certain way and touch-type with all fingers.
There’s true irony in this. The original reason for
the QWERTY arrangement of keys on the key-
board, standard to this day, was to slow downthe
human typist and place commonly used letter
combinations on opposite sides of the keyboard
so that the mechanical arms of the typewriter
wouldn’t jam. Efforts to change this during the
computer age were ignored even if they did
allow for increased typing speed and higher
productivity. People assimilated the original
arrangement and learned to type quickly with it,
and they simply refused to change.
Small keyboards and clumsy human interfaces
hamper the use of PDAs for input, raising the
question for the laptop users: “Why bother?”
Laptops (and possibly the new tablet computers)
are excellent for input and organizing information.
Besides, if you use more than one device to enter
input, you run the risk of being out of sync —
most often you end up accidentally overwriting
the new stuff put into the PDA with the stuff from
your laptop.
A Mac laptop and iPod combo is our answer to
this dilemma. We input and edit all information
with a Mac laptop and update the iPod as nec-
essary. We can then take the iPod into situations
in which we need to view but not change the
information. And we don’t need PDAs — except
to play with as gadget freaks.

Adding a To-Do item
If you’re petrified like the White Rabbit in Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland
with so little time and so much to do, iCal can keep track of your To-Do list.
Click the thumbtack icon to view the To Do items pane of the iCal window 
(or choose Window➪Show To Dos). Choose File➪New To Do to add an item
to the list. 
You can set the priority of the To-Do item so that it sorts to the top 
(highest priority) or bottom (no priority) of the To-Do list. You can also 
set its due date in the Due Date pop-up menu — if you set a due date, the
alarm pop-up appears so that you can also set an alarm for the To-Do 
item. (The alarm also works in your iPod when you synchronize your 
calendar with your iPod.) iCal lets you assign the To-Do item to a specific 
calendar and even add a Web address to the URL field to link the To-Do 
item to a Web page. To mark a To-Do item as finished, select the Completed
option for the item.
Creating a custom calendar
You can create custom calendars in iCal that show only the events that are
assigned to the custom calendar. For example, you might create one custom
calendar for work events, another for family events, another for an exercise
plan, and so on. Your custom calendars are maintained by iCal so that you
can see them all at once or individually in the calendar view. The list of
custom calendars appears in the top-left corner of the iCal window, with a
check box next to each calendar. When you select the check box, the custom
calendar’s events show up in the calendar view. If you select more than one
custom calendar, the events from all selected custom calendars are merged
in the calendar view.
To create a custom calendar, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Calendar, or click the plus (+) button in the bottom-
left corner of the iCal window.
An Untitled item appears in the list of calendars in the top-left corner.
2. Type a new name for the Untitled item.
Click inside the Name text box and type a new name.
3. Turn on or off the custom calendar.
Deselect the custom calendar if you don’t want its events to be displayed.
Select it to display the custom calendar along with other selected custom
calendars (merged with the other custom calendar events).

Keeping Appointments 
with Microsoft Outlook
Microsoft Outlook is offered as part of Microsoft Office (Windows version),
and Microsoft Outlook Express is offered free with Windows. In addition, 
a Mac version of Outlook is available from Microsoft. You can use any of
these applications to create calendars and export the calendar information 
to your iPod.
Outlook provides extensive calendar and scheduling functions and task 
management. You need only a fraction of Outlook’s features to keep a cal-
endar and To-Do list that can be viewed on your iPod. Many of the more
advanced functions, such as scheduling conferences and meetings to coin-
cide with the schedules of other people on a network, have no meaning on 
an iPod. Nevertheless, the iPod is useful for viewing the results of Outlook
activity. If you use those features, any event, appointment, or meeting that
displays in your Outlook calendar is also copied to your iPod along with the
calendar.
With your calendar and To-Do tasks set up in Outlook, you can export the
information to your iPod, as we describe in Chapter 27.
Setting up an appointment or event
To set up an appointment or event in Microsoft Outlook, first launch Outlook,
and then follow these steps:
1. Click the Calendar icon and click any time slot to select it in the
Outlook calendar.
The time slots in the Outlook calendar, as shown in Figure 26-3, appear
when you click the Calendar icon.
2. Choose File➪New➪Appointment to create an appointment or event,
and then fill in the information.
Alternatively, you can right-click the selected time slot and choose New
Appointment (or choose New Recurring Appointment for appointments
that repeat often). Specify start and end times and a location, as shown
in Figure 26-4. 
3. Click the Save and Close button to save the appointment or event.

Adding a To-Do task
The outlook for your future plans might be bright, but you need more than a
crystal ball to keep them that way. If you already use Outlook for your e-mail

Storing Contacts in the Mac OS X
Address Book 
Address Book, a free application that’s provided with OS X for the Mac, has
just about all the features you could ever want for storing names, addresses,
phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and physical addresses. You can drag and
drop addresses and phone numbers from incoming e-mails to avoid having to
type the information, and you can wirelessly copy cards from your address
book to cell phones, PDAs, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Keeping
your iPod synchronized with your addresses and phone numbers is simple
and automatic. You can then have your friends addresses and phone num-
bers with you at all times, right on your iPod.
If you use some other application for storing contact information, you might
want to use Address Book in addition to your other application so you can
import contact information from other applications that support vCards or
the LDIF format (LDIF is the file format for LDAP, which stands for Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol). To do so, launch Address Book and choose File➪
Import, select the format that you used from the submenu, and select the file
that contains the exported information. When your information is in Address
Book, you can synchronize the information with your iPod by using iSync,
eliminating the hassle of dragging vCards to the iPod individually.
Adding and editing contact information
Launch Address Book by double-clicking the Address Book application or by
clicking its icon in the Mac OS X Dock. To add a new card, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Card or click the plus (+) button at the bottom of the
Name pane.
A new blank card appears, ready for you to add information.
2. Type the person’s first and last name over the placeholder first and last
name text boxes, and add contact information to the other text boxes.
308
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

You can type addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses, and so on, as
shown in Figure 26-5. To add multiple addresses, phone numbers, or other
text boxes, click the tiny plus (+) icon next to each type of information
to add more. If some of the text boxes don’t apply, skip them and they
won’t show up in the edited card. You can even enter a two-line address
by pressing Return to continue to the second line.
3. To save your changes, click the Edit button, and Address Book saves
the edits.
To edit a card, select the person in the Name pane and click the Edit button.
To save your changes, click the Edit button again, and Address Book saves
the edits.
You can also add new people to your address book from the Mail program by
selecting an e-mail message and choosing Message➪Add Sender to Address
Book. You can then open Address Book, click the name in the Name pane, and
click the Edit button to edit the person’s card. 
If you receive a vCard as an e-mail attachment (with the .vcf extension), 
you can simply drag the attachment to your Address Book window to 
add the vCard to your address book. Wouldn’t it be nice if all your friends
sent you vCards to keep you up to date, and you never had to retype the
information? 
Be careful with vCards from unknown persons — vCards can be used to carry
viruses.

Chapter 26: Entering Personal Information

Merging cards
One of the coolest features of Address Book is its ability to merge cards. You
might occasionally end up with multiple cards for the same person in Address
Book, typically by saving the sender’s e-mail address from the Mail applica-
tion while also dragging a vCard from the same person. To fix that, you can
hold down Shift and click cards in the Name pane to select the ones that you
want to combine. Then choose Card➪Merge Cards. Address Book creates a
new card that combines all the unique information. You can then delete the
excess cards.
Searching in Address Book
Can’t find the person you’re looking for? Address Book lets you search 
for any text in any of the text boxes of any card. If you’re searching for a
person, and all you have is part of a phone number or even just part of the
person’s name, type the text in the Search text box at the top-right corner 
of the Address Book window. As you type, Address Book displays the names
of the people who have the text fragment anywhere in their cards. Address
Book searches all the information on the cards, including the Notes text box,
and it searches fast, displaying names immediately. If more than one match-
ing card is found, click the arrow buttons at the bottom of the window to
switch between the cards. Or, choose View➪Card And Columns to see a list
of all the cards. To see all your cards again, delete the text from the Search
text box.
Managing contacts in groups
You can combine address cards in Address Book into a group to make it easy to
select all the addresses at once. For example, you might want to group together
all your local friends or all your co-workers. You can then send an e-mail to all
of them at once by choosing the group as the e-mail recipient.
You can also use a group to keep track of a subset of contacts. For exam-
ple, you might want only a subset of your contact list on your iPod rather
than the entire list. To do this, create a group for the subset of contacts 
and export the group as a single vCard file that you can then use on your
iPod.
310
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

To create a group of contacts in Address Book
1. Click the plus (+) sign at the bottom of the Group pane.
Address Book creates a new entry in the Group column with a highlighted
text box so that you can type a new name for the group.
2. Type a name for the group.
3. Select the All item in the Group pane to see your entire list of 
names.
4. Drag and drop names over the group name to add them to your new
group.
After creating a new group, you can see the names in the group by clicking
the group name in the Group pane. Select the All item in the Group pane to
see all the names in the address book.
To put your addresses on the iPod, you can export a vCard file to the iPod
Contacts folder or use the iSync application, as we describe in Chapter 27.
Storing Contacts in Microsoft 
Address Book or Outlook
Microsoft Outlook, provided with the Windows version of Microsoft Office and
also available on the Mac as Outlook Express, provides extensive features for
managing contacts with e-mail and address information. You can also import
address books and contact information into Outlook from programs such as
Eudora, Lotus Organizer, Netscape Messenger, Microsoft Mail, or Microsoft
Schedule+.
Outlook actually uses another application, Microsoft Address Book, to 
store the contact information. Microsoft Address Book lets you gather
address books from other sources, including Microsoft Exchange Server 
and Internet directory services (depending on how you’ve set up Outlook). 
It also includes all the contacts in your Outlook Contacts folder. When you
update the information in your Outlook Contacts folder, the Microsoft
Address Book is updated as well, so you can make all your changes in the
Outlook Contacts folder.

e chose the iPod for music, but we also find it useful while traveling for
viewing the personal information — contacts, appointments, events,
and To-Do tasks — that we manage on our computers.
If you’ve already read Chapter 26, you know how to manage your calendar
activities and your contacts on your computer. In fact, you’re probably 
knee-deep in vCards (virtual business cards) for your Address Book, and the
calendars in your vCalendar files look like they were drawn up in the West
Wing. Information changes often, and new information accumulates quickly,
but you’re well armed with an iPod that can be kept up to date. This chapter
shows you how to synchronize your iPod to have all the information that you
need for viewing and playback. We also show you how to simply copy the
information to your iPod to update it.
Not ’N Sync? Try iSync (Mac Only)
Chances are that you make a lot of changes to addresses, phone numbers, cal-
endar events, and To-Do lists on your Mac. Even though you can update your
iPod with this information manually, remembering to copy each file you need
is difficult. iSync performs this function automatically and keeps all your infor-
mation updated on multiple devices, including your iPod. iSync is available as
a free download from Apple at www.apple.com.

After installing iSync, follow these steps:
1. Connect your iPod to the Mac, and open iSync.
2. Choose Devices➪Add Device. 
iSync searches for devices (such as iPods, cell phones, and PDAs) that
are compatible with the Mac. 
3. Select the iPod from the list of devices.
The iPod icon appears in the iSync window, as shown in Figure 27-1.
(The figure shows two different iPods connected at the same time.)
Click the iPod icon, and the iSync window expands to show the synchroniza-
tion settings for the selected iPod, as shown in Figure 27-2.

Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

You can synchronize all contacts and calendars, or just the ones you select.
Select the Automatically Synchronize When iPod Is Connected option, and
every time you connect your iPod, iSync goes to work. If you don’t want that
level of automation, you can launch iSync anytime and click the Sync Now
button.
iSync performs its magic automatically, but it pauses to inform you if you’re
changing your iPod information, as shown in Figure 27-3. This is a warning so
that you don’t overwrite information that you meant to keep.
After you finish synchronizing, be sure to eject the iPod (by dragging the iPod
icon to the Trash, or in OS X 10.3 or newer, by clicking the Eject icon next to
the iPod icon in the Finder Sidebar) before disconnecting it. If you forget this,
your iPod’s hard drive might freeze up, and you might need to reset your iPod,
as you find out in Chapter 1.
After updating and ejecting the iPod, you can view your addresses and phone
numbers by choosing Extras➪Contacts, and then choosing a name.
You can look at your calendars by choosing Extras➪Calendar➪All. Just select
a calendar, and then use the scroll wheel to scroll through the days of the cal-
endar. You can also select an event to see the event’s details. Use the Next and
Previous buttons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-Do list,
choose Extras➪Calendar➪To Do.
If your calendar events use alarms, you can turn on the iPod’s calendar
alarms. Choose Extras➪Calendar and select Alarms in the Calendar menu
once to set the alarm to Beep, or once again to set it to Silent (so that only
the message for the alarm appears), or one more time to set if to Off. The
Alarms choices cycle from Beep to Silent to Off and then back to Beep.

Chapter 27: Synchronizing Information with Your iPod

Synchronizing Microsoft 
Outlook (Windows)
Third-party programs are available for Windows iPod users that will automat-
ically synchronize your iPod with contacts and calendar info from Microsoft
Outlook.
For example, iPodSync (available at http://iccnet.50megs.com/iPodSync)
is a utility for Windows that lets you keep your Outlook calendar, contacts, and
To-Do tasks synchronized between your PC and your iPod.
iPodSync displays a row of icons along the top of its window. The icons repre-
sent different types of information that you can synchronize with your iPod.
These include contacts from the Outlook Contacts folder (Microsoft Address
Book), calendar appointments and events from the Outlook Calendar, and To-Do
tasks from Outlook Tasks. Click an icon to choose the type of information (such
as Contacts), and then modify your choice with the options available (such as
including birthdays in the notes field for contacts). When everything is set, click
the Sync iPod button to automatically synchronize your iPod. iPodSync exports
contacts into a single vCard file for your iPod Contacts folder and exports cal-
endar information for the iPod Calendar folder.
Outlook can export contacts and calendar information, but it’s a tedious
process of exporting each contact and appointment individually. This failing
of Outlook opens a window of opportunity for entrepreneurs, and several util-
ities and applications provide a way to export contacts and calendar data all
at once. The following are samples of enterprising shareware utilities:
 OutPod: (http://outpod.stoer.de) This utility lets you export con-
tact and calendar information in bulk from Microsoft Outlook to vCard
and vCalendar files, which you can then drag to the iPod, as we describe
in “Adding Calendars Manually” and “Adding Contacts Manually” in this
chapter. 
 EphPod: (www.ephpod.com) This utility lets you update your iPod with
contacts from Outlook. EphPod is a full-featured Windows application
that you can use in place of MusicMatch Jukebox. It supports standard
WinAmp (.m3u) playlists and can synchronize the iPod with a library
of music files. It imports Microsoft Outlook contacts and lets you create
and edit your own contacts. EphPod can also download the latest news,
weather, eBooks, and movie listings to an iPod.
316
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

Adding Calendars Manually
If you use your iPod as a hard drive, as we describe in Chapter 25, you can
copy calendar files directly to the Calendar folder on your iPod. You can copy
industry-standard iCalendar or vCalendar files, which can be exported by
many applications including Microsoft Entourage, Microsoft Outlook, and
Palm Desktop.
In most cases, you can drag an iCalendar file (with the filename extension .ics)
or a vCalendar file (with the filename extension .vcs) to your iPod Calendars
folder, as shown in Figure 27-4.
To save calendar information in the iCalendar format from Microsoft Outlook,
you must save each appointment separately as an ICS (iCalendar) file. Select
the appointment in the calendar view or open the appointment by double-
clicking it. Use the Save As command and select iCalendar from the Save As
Type pop-up menu, and then select a destination for the ICS file. The destina-
tion can be a folder on your hard drive, or it can be the iPod’s Calendars folder.
If you select a folder on your hard drive, be sure to copy the files to the iPod’s
Calendars folder.
Some applications, such as Microsoft Entourage, don’t offer a convenient way
to export calendar information (except perhaps by dragging each appointment
or event onto the desktop). However, iCal for the Mac can import Entourage
calendars, so you can import into iCal (choose File➪Import), and then use
iSync to synchronize your iPod, as we describe earlier in this chapter.
Figure 27-4:

Chapter 27: Synchronizing Information with Your iPod

You can look at your calendars on the iPod by choosing Extras➪Calendar➪All.
Select a calendar and then use the scroll wheel to scroll through the days of
the calendar, or select an event to see the event’s details. Press the Next and
Previous buttons to skip to the next or previous month. To see your To-Do list,
choose Extras➪Calendar➪To Do.
To remove a calendar from your iPod, connect the iPod to your computer
and enable the iPod as a hard drive (see Chapter 25). You can then open the
Calendars folder on the iPod and delete the calendar file. You can also copy
calendar files from the iPod to your hard drive.
Adding Contacts Manually
If you use your iPod as a hard drive, as we describe in Chapter 25, you can
copy contacts in vCard files directly to the Contacts folder on your iPod.
A vCard, or virtual card, is a standard format for exchanging personal informa-
tion. The iPod sorts and displays contacts in the vCard format — you can use
separate vCard files for each person or use a group vCard file that contains
records for many people. 
After enabling the iPod as a hard drive, simply export your contacts as vCards
directly into the Contacts folder of your iPod. In most cases, you can drag
vCard-formatted contacts from the application’s address book to the iPod
Contacts folder.
You might want to copy contacts manually rather than using iSync because
iSync takes longer to synchronize contact information than it takes to copy
new contacts over to the iPod in the Finder.
You can copy one card, a group of cards, or even the entire list as a vCard file
(with a .vcf extension) by dragging the vCard file into the Contacts folder.
Contacts must be in the vCard format to use with the iPod.
You can use applications to export vCard files directly to your iPod. For exam-
ple, in Microsoft Outlook, you can export a vCard file for a contact directly into
your iPod’s Contacts folder by following these steps: 
1. Choose File➪Export to vCard.
2. Use the Save In drop-down menu in the dialog to select the iPod as the
destination drive. 
3. Then select the Contacts folder to save the contacts file.
318
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

As of this writing, the iPod supports only a portion of what you can put into 
a vCard. For example, you can include photos and sounds in vCards used by
other applications, but you can’t open up those portions of the vCard by using
the iPod.
Using Utilities to Copy Files and Music
The iPod has spawned a thriving industry of third-party accessories and
products. Some of the most useful products are utility programs that expand
the capabilities of the iPod or your ability to update the iPod, and even 
full-featured programs that are designed as replacements for iTunes and
MusicMatch Jukebox. With so many programs to check out, you might be
overwhelmed. We’ve selected three of the best programs for the Mac and
Windows (as of this writing).
Keep in mind, with programs that allow music copying functions, that copy-
ing copyrighted material to other computers without permission is illegal.
Don’t steal music — or anything else, for that matter.
Mac utilities
On the Mac, third-party offerings have focused on extending the capabilities
of the iPod and its software to do things like copying music from the iPod to
the computer and updating the iPod with contacts and calendar information.
Take a glance at the following examples:
 iPod It 2.3.2: (www.zapptek.com/ipod-it) With this software, you
can transfer personal information to your iPod from Entourage, Stickies,
Mail, Address Book, and iCal. You can even download weather forecasts
and news headlines directly to your iPod.
 iPod Access v3.1.5: (www.findleydesigns.com/ipodaccess) This util-
ity lets you transfer songs from an iPod to a Mac. iPod Access is available
from Findley Designs, Inc.
 iPodRip 3.3.1: (www.thelittleappfactory.com/software/ipodrip.
php) This third-party utility, available from The Little App Factory, lets
you transfer music from your iPod back to your iTunes library and listen
to music on your iPod through your computer (saving hard drive space).
It supports all iPod song formats including MP3, AAC, Protected AAC, and
Audible.com books.
319
Chapter 27: Synchronizing Information with Your iPod

Windows utilities
On Windows, third-party offerings fill a void left by the lack of an iSync-like
program. Lots more third-party programs exist for Windows, and they do
everything from extending the capabilities of the iPod and updating contacts
and calendar information to replacing the need for MusicMatch Jukebox and
iTunes.
 iPodSync: (http://iccnet.50megs.com/iPodSync) Keep Microsoft
Outlook calendars, contacts, tasks, and notes synchronized between a
Windows PC and an iPod. iPodSync exports industry standard vCards
for contacts, and uses the iCalendar format for appointment informa-
tion. iPodSync can even synchronize Outlook notes and tasks. For more

Updating and Troubleshooting
In This Chapter
 Your first steps for troubleshooting iPod problems
 Updating the iPod system software and firmware for Mac or Windows by using iTunes
 Restoring an iPod to its original factory condition and settings
 Troubleshooting the MusicMatch Jukebox configuration with iPod for Windows
T
his chapter describes some of the problems that you might encounter
with your iPod and computer and how to fix them. If your iPod fails to
turn on, or if your computer fails to recognize it, you can most likely find a
solution here.
This chapter also covers updating the firmware and software on your iPod,
and restoring your iPod to its factory default condition. (Firmware is software
encoded in hardware.) That last option is a drastic measure that erases any
music or information on the iPod, but it usually solves the problem if nothing
else does.
Before Apple introduced iTunes for Windows, PC users had no other choice
except MusicMatch Jukebox, which included the iPod for Windows utility 
and the iPod Updater for updating and restoring an iPod. Apple revamped 
the iPod Updater along with developing iTunes for Windows, and now offers
a new version of the iPod Updater, which is virtually the same for Mac and
Windows. As a result, the troubleshooting instructions are different for iTunes
and MusicMatch Jukebox configurations. Here’s how to use this chapter:
 If you use iTunes, you can skip “Troubleshooting iPod for Windows and
MusicMatch Jukebox.” 
 If you use MusicMatch Jukebox, you can skip “Using iPod Updater.”

First Troubleshooting Steps
Problems can arise with electronics and software that can prevent the iPod
from turning on at all or from turning on properly with all its music and
playlists. You can also have problem in the connection between your iPod
and your computer.
When you turn on your iPod, built-in startup diagnostic software checks 
the iPod hard drive for damage and attempts to repair it if necessary. If 
the iPod finds an issue when it is turned on, it automatically uses internal
diagnostics to check for and repair any damage. You might see a disk scan
icon on your iPod screen after turning it on, indicating that a problem 
was fixed. If this happens, update your iPod firmware and software, as 
we describe in “Updating the iPod with the iPod Updater,” later in this 
chapter.
Checking the Hold switch
If your iPod refuses to turn on, check the position of the Hold switch on top
of the iPod. The Hold switch locks the iPod buttons so that you don’t acci-
dentally activate them. Slide the Hold switch away from the headphone con-
nection, hiding the orange layer, to unlock the buttons. (If you see the orange
layer underneath one end of the Hold switch, the switch is still in the locked
position.)
Checking the power
Got power? The battery might not be charged enough. If the battery is too
low for normal operation, the iPod doesn’t turn on. Instead, a low battery
screen appears for about three seconds, and then disappears. At that point,
your only choice is to connect the iPod to an AC power source, wait for a
moment, and then turn the power on by pushing any button on the iPod. If
your source of AC power is your computer (using the FireWire connection),
make sure that the computer is on and not set to go to sleep. The battery
icon in the upper-right corner of the display indicates whether it’s full or
recharging. For more information about maintaining a healthy battery, see
Chapter 1.
322

Resetting the iPod
This operation resets the operating system of the iPod and restarts the system.
Sometimes when your iPod gets confused or refuses to turn on, you can fix it
by resetting it. Follow these steps:
1. Toggle the Hold switch.
Push the Hold switch to hold (lock), and then set it back to unlock.
2. Press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously and hold for
at least five seconds until the Apple logo appears; then release the
buttons when you see the Apple logo.
The appearance of the Apple logo signals that your iPod is resetting
itself, so you no longer have to hold down the buttons.
It’s important to release the Menu and Play/Pause buttons as soon as you 
see the Apple logo. If you continue to hold down the buttons after the logo
appears, the iPod displays the low battery icon, and you must connect it to 
a power source before using your iPod again.
After resetting, everything should be back to normal, including your music
and data files.
Draining the iPod battery
Certain types of battery-powered devices sometimes run into problems if 
the battery hasn’t drained in a while. In rare cases, the iPod might go dark
and can’t be reset until the battery is drained. If the above steps didn’t
resolve the issue, disconnect the iPod from any power source and leave it
disconnected for approximately 24 hours. After this period, connect it to
power and reset.
Try to keep the iPod at room temperature — generally near 68 degrees
Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius), but you can use iPod anywhere between 
50 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 35 degrees Celsius). If you have left the
iPod in the cold, let it warm up to room temperature before waking it from
sleep. Otherwise, a low-battery icon might appear, and the iPod won’t wake
up properly. If the iPod doesn’t wake from sleep after warming up, connect
the power adapter and reset the iPod, as we describe in the previous section.
323
Chapter 28: Updating and Troubleshooting

Hitting the panic button
Actually it’s never a good idea to hit the panic button, even if there is one,
but if you have tried the solutions above and your iPod still doesn’t turn on,
check the following:
 Make sure that the iPod is the only device in your FireWire or USB chain.
Although you can connect a FireWire or USB device to another FireWire
or USB device that has a connection, forming a chain, it isn’t a good idea
to do this with an iPod.
 Make sure that you use the FireWire or USB cable that came with your
iPod and that the cable is in good condition.
 Try connecting the iPod to the built-in FireWire or USB connection of a
different computer to see if the symptom persists.
If, after turning on the iPod, all you see on the display is the Apple logo and
iPod name, and the device seems to be restarting over and over, try these
steps if you use a FireWire connection to your Mac or PC:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer’s FireWire connection.
This procedure doesn’t work with a USB connection because it
requires power. Make sure that the computer is on and is not set 
to go to sleep.
2. Reset the iPod, as we describe in “Resetting the iPod,” earlier in 
this chapter.
3. When the Apple icon appears on the display, immediately press and
hold the Previous and Next buttons until the Do Not Disconnect screen
or FireWire icon appears.
You can now restore the iPod — see “Restoring an iPod with iPod
Updater,” later in this chapter.
If the Do Not Disconnect screen or FireWire icon doesn’t appear, repeat Steps 2
and 3. (You might need to press and hold the Previous and Next buttons even
more quickly.) If, after repeating these steps, the Do Not Disconnect screen or
FireWire icon still doesn’t appear, the iPod might need to be repaired. You can
get more information, updated troubleshooting instructions, and links to the
iPod repair site by visiting the Apple support site for the iPod (www.apple.
com/support/ipod).

Using iPod Updater
The iPod Updater can update the system software that controls the iPod and
can also update the firmware for the iPod’s hard drive, if necessary. The update
doesn’t affect the music or data stored on iPod’s drive. iPod Updater is pro-
vided on the CD-ROM that comes with your iPod. To find out whether a new
version is available for downloading, go to the Apple Web page for the iPod
(www.apple.com/ipod).
If you use MusicMatch Jukebox rather than iTunes on your Windows PC, skip
this section and see “Troubleshooting iPod for Windows and MusicMatch
Jukebox,” later in this chapter.
If you use a Mac and you’ve turned on the Software Update option in your
System Preferences, Apple automatically informs you of updates to your Apple
software for the Mac, including iTunes, iCal, Address Book, iSync, and the iPod
system software. All you need to do is select which updates to download and
click the Install button to download them.
Before downloading the iPod Updater from the Apple Web site, make sure
that you pick the appropriate version — Mac or Windows. The iPod Updater
includes updates for all generations of iPods and can detect which iPod you
have. As of this writing it offers version 3.0 for fourth-generation iPods, ver-
sion 2.2 (for third-generation iPods), and version 1.4 (for first- and second-
generation iPods).
Updating the iPod with iPod Updater
Be sure that your iPod has the most recent iPod firmware update installed.
To determine which version of the iPod software is installed on your iPod,
press the Menu button until you see the iPod main menu, and then choose
Settings➪About. (With first-generation and second-generation iPods, choose
Settings➪Info.) You see information next to the word Version that describes
the software version installed on the iPod.
You can also determine the software version on your iPod by using iPod
Updater. Connect the iPod to your computer and launch iPod Updater. The
iPod Updater window appears. The software version appears next to the
Software Version heading. If this version of the iPod Updater application 
has a newer software version that it can install on the iPod, you see (needs
update) next to the version number. If not, you see (up to date).
325
Chapter 28: Updating and Troubleshooting

To update the iPod’s firmware and software, follow these steps for both the
Mac and Windows versions:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
iTunes opens, and if you set your iPod for automatic update, iTunes 
synchronizes the iPod with music and playlists from its library. The
iTunes display notifies you when the iTunes music update is complete.
2. Quit iTunes.
On a Mac, quit by choosing iTunes➪Quit iTunes. On a Windows PC,
choose File➪Exit.
3. Launch the iPod Updater application.
On a Mac, this application is located in the Utilities folder, which is in
your Applications folder. On a Windows PC, you can find it under iPod 
in the Start menu. The Updater dialog appears, as shown in Figure 28-1
(Windows version).
4. Click the Update button.
(In Mac OS X, you might need to click the padlock and type an adminis-
trator account name and password first.) If the Update button is grayed
out, the software on the iPod is the same version or a newer version than
the iPod Updater application.
5. Follow the instructions to disconnect and reconnect your iPod, if
required.
Some iPod models need to be disconnected temporarily during the
process of updating the software; others do not. If you see a message
asking you to disconnect the iPod, follow the instructions displayed 
with the message.
Figure 28-1:
The iPod
Updater
utility lets
you update
or restore
your iPod.
326
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

The iPod Updater notifies you when the update is finished, and the
Update button is grayed-out, indicating that your iPod no longer needs
an update.
6. When the update is finished, quit iPod Updater.
On a Mac, you can quit by choosing iPod Updater➪Quit iPod Updater.
On a Windows PC, quit by clicking the dialog’s Close button (refer to
Figure 28-1).
7. Eject the iPod.
When you quit iPod Updater, iTunes might launch again because your
iPod is still connected. You can eject the iPod by clicking the iPod Eject
button in iTunes.
If iTunes doesn’t launch, you can eject the iPod on a Mac clicking the
Eject button next to the iPod name in the Finder or by dragging the iPod
icon to the Trash. On a Windows PC, right-click the iPod name or icon
and choose Eject from the shortcut menu.
After ejecting the iPod, wait for its display to show the main menu or the OK
to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or
disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before
ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod, which we describe earlier in
this chapter.
Restoring an iPod with iPod Updater
Restoring the iPod erases the iPod’s hard drive and restores the device to its
original factory settings, so make sure that you back up any important data
that you keep stored on your iPod. To replace music that was erased by the
restore operation, synchronize or update your iPod from your computer’s
music library, as we describe in Chapter 11.
To restore an iPod, follow these steps for both the Mac and Windows 
versions:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
If your iPod is working, iTunes opens, and if you set your iPod for auto-
matic update, iTunes synchronizes the iPod with music and playlists from
its library. The iTunes display notifies you when the iTunes music update
is complete. If your iPod isn’t working, skip to Step 3.
327
Chapter 28: Updating and Troubleshooting

2. Quit iTunes.
On a Mac, quit by choosing iTunes➪Quit iTunes. On a Windows PC,
choose File➪Exit.
3. Launch the iPod Updater application.

Figure 28-1).
7. Set up your iPod by using the iTunes Setup Assistant.
In the iTunes Setup Assistant dialog, type a name for iPod in the space
provided, and then proceed with setting up iTunes with your iPod, as we
describe in Chapter 2.
8. Quit iTunes Setup Assistant, and update your iPod from your music
library.
When you quit iTunes Setup Assistant, iTunes might launch again
because your iPod is still connected. You can use this opportunity 
to update your iPod with the music in your library, as we describe in
Chapter 11. You can also copy data to the iPod while it’s mounted as a
hard drive (see Chapter 25).
9. When you’re finished updating the iPod with music and data, eject
the iPod.
You can eject the iPod by using the iPod Eject button in iTunes.
If iTunes doesn’t launch, you can eject the iPod on a Mac by clicking the
Eject button next to the iPod name in a Finder window Sidebar or by drag-
ging the iPod icon to the Trash icon (which turns into an Eject icon). On
a Windows PC, right-click the iPod name or icon and choose Eject from
the shortcut menu.

Troubleshooting iPod for Windows 
and MusicMatch Jukebox
It’s no secret that Windows is somewhat different than the Mac, and trou-
bleshooting a complex and varied Windows system can be a daunting task.
Installing the latest updates and service packs from Microsoft ensures that
your Windows system is up to date.
If you use MusicMatch Jukebox with your iPod on a Windows PC, you use an
older version of the iPod Updater application to update or restore your iPod.
This software was installed when you installed iPod for Windows by using the
iPod for Windows CD-ROM, as we describe in Chapter 7. The iPod Updater can
update the software that controls iPod and can also update the firmware for
the iPod’s hard drive, if necessary. The update doesn’t affect the data stored
on iPod’s hard drive.
Updating the iPod with the MusicMatch
Jukebox configuration
To update the iPod’s firmware and software with the version of iPod Updater
supplied on CD-ROM with MusicMatch Jukebox, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer.
MusicMatch Jukebox opens, displaying the iPod in the PortablesPlus
window. If you set your iPod for automatic update, MusicMatch Jukebox
synchronizes the iPod with music and playlists from its library.
MusicMatch Jukebox notifies you when the music update is complete.
2. Quit MusicMatch Jukebox.
Quit by clicking the Close button in its window, or choose File➪Exit.
3. Open the iPod Updater application by choosing Start➪iPod➪iPod
Updater.
4. Click the Update button.
If the Update button is dimmed, the software on the iPod is the same
version or a newer version than the iPod Updater.
A progress bar appears. When the progress bar shows that the update 
is finished, the Update button is dimmed, indicating that your iPod no
longer needs an update.
329
Chapter 28: Updating and Troubleshooting

5. Click the Close button in the iPod Updater to quit.
6. Eject the iPod.
When you quit iPod Updater, MusicMatch Jukebox might launch again
because your iPod is still connected. You can eject the iPod by clicking
the Eject button at the bottom-left side of the MusicMatch Jukebox
PortablesPlus window.
If MusicMatch Jukebox doesn’t launch, you can eject the iPod in one of
two ways:
• Right-click the iPod Watcher icon in the taskbar at the bottom of
the Windows desktop to see a contextual menu. Choose Unmount
from the contextual menu.
• Right-click the Safe Remove Hardware icon in the taskbar. From 
the contextual menu, select the Apple IEEE 1394 (FireWire) device
if you’re using FireWire, or select the USB Mass Storage device if
you’re using USB, and then click the Unmount button.
Because of the way iPod for Windows works with MusicMatch Jukebox, 
you should use only one of the two eject methods (or the Eject button in
MusicMatch Jukebox) to eject your iPod. Do not right-click the iPod icon 
in the My Computer window and choose Eject from the shortcut menu 
that appears. This Eject option doesn’t work with iPod for Windows and
MusicMatch Jukebox.
After ejecting the iPod, wait for its display to show the main menu or the OK
to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or
disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before
ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod, which we cover earlier in this
chapter.
Restoring an iPod with the MusicMatch
Jukebox configuration
To restore an iPod by using the version of iPod Updater that’s supplied on
CD-ROM with MusicMatch Jukebox, follow these steps:
1. Connect the iPod to your computer. 
If your iPod is working, MusicMatch Jukebox opens, displaying the iPod
in the PortablesPlus window. If you set your iPod for automatic update,
MusicMatch Jukebox synchronizes the iPod with music and playlists from
its library. MusicMatch Jukebox notifies you when the music update is
complete. If your iPod is not working, see the following section, “If your
iPod doesn’t appear.”

5. Click the Restore button to confirm the restore operation.
A progress bar appears, indicating the progress of the restore operation.
6. When the restore operation finishes, quit iPod Updater.
Quit by clicking the window’s close box.
7. Launch MusicMatch Jukebox, and in the MusicMatch Jukebox Device
Setup dialog, type a name for iPod in the space provided.
The Complete Library Synchronization option and the Automatically
Synchronize on Device Connection option are selected by default, but
you can turn them off if you prefer, as we describe in Chapter 12.
8. Click OK to finish device setup.
9. Select the iPod in the PortablesPlus window and click the Sync button
to synchronize the iPod with the library of this computer.
Wait until the synchronization is complete before ejecting the iPod.
10. Eject the iPod.
Click the Eject button at the bottom-left side of the MusicMatch Jukebox
PortablesPlus window.
After ejecting the iPod, wait for its display to show the main menu or the OK
to disconnect message. You can then disconnect the iPod from its dock or
disconnect the dock from the computer. Don’t ever disconnect an iPod before
ejecting it. You might have to reset your iPod, as we describe earlier in this
chapter.
If your iPod doesn’t appear
Sometimes MusicMatch Jukebox fails to recognize an iPod through the
FireWire connection. Don’t panic — follow these steps first:
1. Follow the instructions in the “First Troubleshooting Steps” section at
the beginning of this chapter.
Make sure that your connection from the iPod to the computer is prop-
erly secure and that your iPod has power.
331
Chapter 28: Updating and Troubleshooting

2. Wait until activity stops on your iPod.
You can observe a lot by watching the iPod’s display. The hard drive
activity indicator (two arrows spinning in a circle) appears in the upper-
left corner of the display. Before ejecting or disconnecting, wait for the
arrows to stop spinning.
3. Eject the iPod.
You can eject the iPod in one of two ways:
• Right-click the iPod Watcher icon in the taskbar at the bottom of
the Windows desktop to see a contextual menu. Choose Unmount
from the contextual menu.
• Right-click the Safe Remove Hardware icon in the taskbar. From 
the contextual menu, select the Apple IEEE 1394 (FireWire) device
if you’re using FireWire, or select the USB Mass Storage device if
you’re using USB, and then click the Unmount button.
4. Restart your PC.
5. Disconnect the iPod and reconnect it.
6. Launch MusicMatch Jukebox if it doesn’t launch automatically.
If MusicMatch Jukebox still doesn’t recognize the iPod, try restoring the iPod,
which we cover in the section “Restoring an iPod with the MusicMatch Jukebox
configuration.”
As shipped from the factory, the iPod’s hard drive is formatted as a Mac hard
drive. When you install the iPod with MusicMatch Jukebox, iPod for Windows
2.0 software reformats the drive by using the Windows (FAT32) format. If the
iPod doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox the first time you connect it after
installing the software, the iPod might be still formatted as a Mac hard drive.
You can check the format on your iPod by choosing Settings➪About. If the
About display doesn’t say “Windows,” then reinstall the iPod software as
described in Chapter 7, and check again to make sure it formatted the drive
using the Windows (FAT32) format.
If the iPod doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox, but the Do Not Disconnect
screen appears on the iPod display, open the iPod Manager utility and make
sure that MusicMatch Jukebox is the home application. The iPod Manager
utility is provided with iPod for Windows to change iPod settings, launch the
software updater, check the Apple site for updates, and change the home
application for the iPod (set to MusicMatch Jukebox by default). To change
the home application with iPod Manager, follow these steps:
332
Part V: Have iPod, Will Travel 

1. Click the iPod Watcher icon in the taskbar.
Alternatively, you can right-click the icon and choose iPod Manager from
the shortcut menu, or choose Start➪iPod➪iPod Manager.
2. Click the Change Home Application button and select MusicMatch
from the drop-down menu.
3. Click OK to close the iPod Manager window.
4. Eject the iPod.
5. Disconnect the iPod and reconnect it.
6. Launch MusicMatch Jukebox if it doesn’t launch automatically.
If the iPod doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox, but you see menus on the
iPod’s display, make sure that “disk mode” is enabled in the iPod Manager
utility.
If your iPod still doesn’t appear in MusicMatch Jukebox, restart the Windows
system while the iPod is connected. Occasionally the FireWire connection on
a PC conflicts with another device or fails to work for some mysterious reason.
You can tell when this happens: Use the System control panel to view the
Hardware panel, and then click Device Manager. The Apple iPod IEEE 1394
device should be listed, and if it has a yellow exclamation point next to it, a
conflict exists. You might be able to temporarily resolve the conflict by
restarting Windows.

U
nfortunately, this isn’t a perfect world. Even though we think the iPod
comes as close to perfection as possible, at some point, your iPod isn’t
going to work as you expect it to. When that happens, turn to this chapter
because here we show you how to fix the most common problems.
How Do I Get My iPod to Wake Up?
If your iPod doesn’t turn on, don’t panic — at least not yet. Try the following
suggestions to get your iPod to respond:
 Check the Hold switch’s position on top of the iPod. The Hold switch
locks the iPod buttons so that you don’t accidentally activate them. Slide
the Hold switch away from the headphone connection, hiding the orange
layer, to unlock the buttons.
 Check to see whether the iPod has enough juice. Is the battery charged
up? Connect the iPod to a power source and see whether it works.

 Reset your iPod if the iPod still doesn’t turn on. First toggle the Hold
switch, and then press the Menu and Play/Pause buttons simultaneously.
Hold them for at least five seconds until the Apple logo appears. Release
the buttons as soon as you see the Apple logo. If that doesn’t work, see
Chapter 28.
How Do I Get My Battery 
to Last Longer?
You can do a lot to keep your battery going longer (much to the envy of your
friends), including the following:
 Press the Play/Pause button to pause (stop) playback. Don’t just turn off
your car or home stereo or take out your headphones — if you don’t also
pause playback, your iPod continues playing until the playlist or album
ends. When playback is paused, the power-save feature turns off the iPod
after two minutes of inactivity.
 Hold down the Play/Pause button to turn off the iPod when not using it.
Rather than wait for two minutes of inactivity for the power-save feature
to turn off the iPod, you can turn it off yourself and save battery time.
 Turn off the backlighting. If you don’t need to use backlighting, turn it
off. It can drain the power.
 Avoid changing tracks by pressing the Previous/Rewind or Next/Fast-
Forward buttons. The iPod uses a memory cache to load and play songs.
If you frequently change tracks by pressing the Previous or Next buttons,
the cache has to turn on the hard drive to load and play the songs, which
drains the battery.
 Use compressed AAC or MP3 files. Playing larger uncompressed AIFF or
WAV files takes more power because the hard drive inside the iPod has
to refresh its memory buffers more frequently to process more informa-
tion as the song plays.
How Do I Keep My Scroll 
Wheel from Going Crazy?
Second-generation and third-generation iPods use a nonmoving scroll wheel
that works like the trackpad (also sometimes called a touchpad) of a laptop
computer. Although the trackpad-style scroll wheel is far better than the first-
generation moving wheel (which could be hampered by sand or dirt and had
moving parts that could be damaged), it has problems of its own: it goes crazy
338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

sometimes, and it can be very sensitive — not sensitive to criticism, but to
the touch of your finger.
The trackpad-style scroll wheel translates the electrical charge from your
finger into movement on the iPod display. If you use more than one finger or
have another finger nearby, the scroll wheel might detect the signal and skip
over selections or go backwards while scrolling forwards, and so on. If the
scroll wheel has excessive moisture on it, from humidity or a wet hand, wipe
the wheel with a soft, dry cloth.
Don’t use lotion or moisturizer on your hand right before touching the scroll
wheel. Don’t try to use pencil erasers, pen caps, or other types of pointers to
scroll the scroll wheel (they won’t work with trackpad-style scroll wheels and
may damage other types of scroll wheels). Don’t use your ring finger or the
hand that sports a heavy bracelet or similar jewelry — these can throw off
the sensors in the scroll wheel.
How Do I Get My Computer 
to Recognize My iPod?
Follow the first troubleshooting steps outlined in Chapter 28. If iTunes or
MusicMatch Jukebox still does not recognize the iPod, you can use the iPod
Updater to restore the iPod.
Also, make sure that your FireWire or USB cable is in good condition. Try con-
necting your iPod to another computer by using the same type of connection
to see whether the same problem occurs. (Your computer might be to blame.)
If the same type of connection (FireWire or USB) to the other computer works,
the problem is your computer’s connection or software. If it doesn’t work, the
problem is your iPod or cable. You can try a new cable to see whether that
works.
What Do I Do if a Strange Icon 
Appears on My iPod?
When you turn on your iPod, built-in diagnostic software checks the iPod hard
drive. If the iPod finds a problem when it’s turned on, it automatically uses
internal diagnostics to check for and repair any damage. You might see a disk
scan icon on your iPod screen after turning it on, indicating that a problem
was fixed. If this happens, restore your iPod to its original factory condition
(see Chapter 28), and load it again with music.

If the iPod displays any other strange icon, such as a backwards Apple logo, a
disk icon with a flashing question mark, or the dreaded disk-with-magnifying
glass icon, it might need to be repaired. You can arrange for repair by visiting
the Apple support site for the iPod (www.apple.com/support/ipod).
How Do I Restore My iPod to its Original
Condition from the Factory?
Restoring the iPod erases your iPod’s hard drive and returns the device to its
original factory condition. Restore erases all of the data on the hard drive, so
make sure that you back up any important data that you have stored on your
iPod. You can use the iPod Updater utility to restore your iPod, as we describe
in Chapter 28. When finished, add music back to your iPod from the iTunes
library or from your MusicMatch Jukebox library, and then resynchronize
your iPod with calendar and contact information.
How Do I Update My iPod to Have 
the Newest Software?
To determine which version of the iPod software is installed on your iPod,
press the Menu button until you see the iPod main menu, and then choose
Settings➪About (in earlier versions, choose Settings➪Info). Look at the ver-
sion number that describes the software version installed on your iPod.
You can use the iPod Updater application to update or restore your iPod 
(see Chapter 28).
How Do I Update My iPod with Music
When My Library Is Larger than 
My iPod’s Capacity?
If you have less space on your iPod than music in your iTunes library, you
can update manually (by album, artist, or songs), update automatically by
selected songs only, or update automatically by playlist.
340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

When you update by playlist automatically, you can create playlists exclu-
sively for your iPod. A smart playlist can be limited to, for example, 18GB 
(for a 20GB iPod).
By combining the features of smart playlists (in Chapter 10) and updating
automatically by playlist (in Chapter 11), you can control the updating
process while also automatically limiting the amount of music you copy to
your iPod.
You can also update automatically and keep your iPod synchronized to a
subset of your library. iTunes creates a new playlist specially designed for
updating your iPod automatically. iTunes decides which songs and albums to
include in this playlist by using the ratings that you can set for each song in
the iTunes song information, as we describe in Chapter 11.
How Do I Cross-Fade Music 
Playback with My iPod?
You can fade the ending of one song into the beginning of the next one to
slightly overlap songs, just like a radio DJ, when you use iTunes. The cross-
fade setting is the amount of time between the end of the fade-out from the
first song and the start of the fade-in to the second song.
To cross-fade songs on your iPod, you have to play your iPod songs through
iTunes on your computer. Connect your iPod to your computer and connect
your computer to a stereo or connect speakers (or headphones) to your com-
puter. Hold down Ô-Option (on a Mac) or Ctrl-Alt (on a PC) as you launch
iTunes and you can then select iPod in the iTunes Source pane.
By default, iTunes is set to have a short cross-fade of one second.
If you’re playing songs on an iPod that’s connected to your computer and
also playing songs from your iTunes library (or even on a second iPod, both
connected to your computer), your songs cross-fade automatically.
You can change this cross-fade setting by choosing iTunes➪Preferences 
(on a Mac) or Edit➪Preferences (on a PC), and then clicking the Audio
button. You can then increase or decrease the amount of the cross-fade 
with the Crossfade Playback option.

How Do I Get Less Distortion with 
Car and Portable Speakers?
The 40GB iPod model designed for the Unites States has a powerful 60-milliwatt
amplifier to deliver audio signals through the headphone connection. It has a
frequency response of 20 Hz to 20 kHz, which provides distortion-free music
at the lowest or highest pitches, but it might cause distortion at maximum
volume depending on the recorded material.
For optimal sound quality, set the iPod volume at no more than three-quarters
of the maximum volume and adjust your listening volume by using the volume
control or equivalent on your car stereo or portable speaker system. (If no
volume control exists, you have no choice but to control the volume from
the iPod.) By lowering the iPod from maximum volume, you prevent over-
amplification, which can cause distortion and reduce audio quality.

Eleven Tips for the Equalizer
In This Chapter
 Adjusting the equalizer on your home stereo
 Taking advantage of the iPod’s equalizer preset
 Getting rid of unwanted noise
You play your iPod in many environments. The same song that sounds
like music to your ears in your car might sound like screeching hyenas
on a plane. In this chapter, we show you can fix most sound problems that
occur with iPods. Soon you’ll be cruising to the beat all the time — no matter
where you are.
Setting the Volume to the Right Level
Before using the iPod equalizer (EQ) to refine the sound, make sure the volume
of the iPod is set to about half or three-quarters (not more) so that you don’t
introduce distortion. Then set your speaker system or home stereo volume
before trying to refine the sound with equalizers.
Adjusting Another Equalizer
When you have the iPod connected to another system with an equalizer, try
adjusting that equalizer:
 Home stereo system: Refine the sound with your home stereo’s equal-
izer because it might offer more flexibility and can be set precisely for
the listening environment.
 Car stereos: The same rule applies as your home stereo — adjust the
car stereo’s equalizer first.

Setting Booster Presets
When playing music with your iPod through a home stereo or speakers 
(without a built-in equalizer) in a heavily draped and furnished room, try 
the iPod’s Treble Booster EQ preset or create a your own EQ preset (see
Chapter 21) that raises the frequencies above 1 kHz. Boosting these higher
frequencies makes the music sound naturally alive.
Reducing High Frequencies
When using your iPod to play music through a home stereo (without a built-
in equalizer) in a basement with smooth, hard walls and concrete floors, you
might want to use the iPod’s Treble Reducer EQ preset, which reduces the
high frequencies to make the sound less brittle.
Increasing Low Frequencies
If you use high-quality acoustic-suspension compact speakers, you might
need to add a boost to the low frequencies (bass) with the Bass Booster EQ
preset so that you can boogie with the beat a little better. The Small Speakers
EQ preset also boosts the low frequencies and lowers the high frequencies to
give you a fuller sound.
Setting Presets for Trucks and SUVs
We use our iPods in different types of cars — one is a sedan; the other a 
4-wheel drive truck. Trucks need more bass and treble, and the Rock EQ preset
sounds good for most of the music that we listen to. We also recommend the
Bass Booster EQ preset when using your iPod in a truck if the Rock preset
doesn’t boost the bass enough. In the sedan, the iPod sounds fine without
any equalizer adjustment.
Setting Presets When You’re 
Eight Miles High
When using your iPod on an airplane where jet noise is a factor, try using the
Bass Booster EQ preset to hear the lower frequencies in your headphones
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

and compensate for the deficiencies of headphones in loud environments.
You might want to use the Classical EQ preset, which boosts both the high
and low frequencies for extra treble and bass. Try the Bose QuietComfort 2
Acoustic Noise Canceling headphones (www.bose.com) for plane travel —
they work great!
Reducing Tape Noise 
and Scratch Sounds
To reduce the hiss of an old tape recording (or the scratchy sound of songs
recorded from an old vinyl record), reduce the highest frequencies with the
Treble Reducer EQ preset.
Reducing Turntable Rumble and Hum
To reduce the low-frequency rumble in songs recorded from a turntable (for
vinyl records) or recorded with a hum pickup, choose the Bass Reducer EQ
preset.
Reducing Off-Frequency Harshness 
and Nasal Vocals
To reduce a particularly nasal vocal sound reminiscent of Donald Duck
(caused by off-frequency recording of the song source, making the song 
more harsh-sounding), try the R&B EQ preset, which reduces the midrange
frequencies while boosting all the other frequencies.
Cranking Up the Volume to Eleven
If you want that larger-than-life sound, use the Loudness preset, and then jack
up the Preamp slider to the max, turn up your stereo all the way, and put your
fingers in your ears to protect them. Then consult the DVD This is Spinal Tap
or the Spinal Tap fan site, http://spinaltapfan.com/.
