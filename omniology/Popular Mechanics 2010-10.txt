afer months  
of design, 
development and 
funcionality 
teﬆing, we 
launched the 
showcase issue of 
PoPular Mechanics 
on the ipad in July. 
as soon as it went 
live on the app 
store, comments 
from critics, peers 
and readers ﬁlled 
our inboxes and 
the tech media. 
Gadget leader 
Gizmodo.com 
announced:  
“Te lateﬆ big 
magazine iPad 
app is here: 
PoPular  
Mechanics. It’s 
very possibly the 
beﬆ.”
But great 
response didn’t 
ﬆop there. Nearly 
40,000 people 
have downloaded 
the app so far, and 
75 percent of 
people who rated 
the app gave it 
four or ﬁve ﬆars. 
as one buyer put it: 
“Tis is exacly 
what the ipad was 
waiting for!”
While we’re 
humbled by the 
success of our ﬁrﬆ 
foray onto the 
ipad, we’re already 
hard at work 
developing a fully 
interacive 
monthly edition of 
PM, which  
will launch with 
the November 
issue. so now 
you’ll have two 
great ways to read 
pM: paper or ’pad.

e should have seen this 
coming. Twenty-five 
years ago, a series of dev-
astating technological 
failures rattled the  global 
engineering community: 
the catastrophic melt-
down at Chernobyl; the 
gas leak at a Union Car-
bide facility in Bhopal, India, which killed an 
estimated 20,000; the loss of the Challenger 
space shuttle. In each case, capable engineers 
had developed large, complex systems whose 
inherent risks they believed they had under 
control. And in each case, they were surprised 
when the unthinkable happened.
In the aftermath of those disasters, engi-
neers focused anew on failure analysis, the 
study of how complex systems—and the people 
who run them—fall apart under pressure.  
At schools such as Stanford and Drexel, 
researchers study the roots of technological 
breakdowns. They’ve found that engineering 
disasters, like military defeats, are rarely the 
result of a single decision or stroke of bad luck. 
They are often months or years in the making. 
And, when the inevitable disaster ﬁnally strikes, 
the experts in charge are overwhelmed and 
have no backup plan. 
In this issue, PM contributing editors Carl 
Hoffman and Davin Coburn analyze the events 
that resulted in the devastating failure of BP’s 
Deepwater Horizon oil rig. What they found is 
a disaster that never should have happened. On 
the long checklist of technological, cultural and 
managerial factors that lead an organization to 
catastrophe, BP inked every box. The late Soviet 
Union’s hapless nuclear technicians and 
NASA’s bureaucratized engineers were over-
matched by complex systems whose risks they 
didn’t fully appreciate. BP has no such excuse. 
The lessons of Chernobyl, Challenger and doz-
ens of other engineering failures have been 
studied for years. Everyone in a company or 
agency engaged in dangerous, highly techno-
logical work should understand them.
Every general—in fact, every lieutenant and 
captain—worth his brass has studied why Rom-
mel lost in Africa, Lee at Gettysburg and the U.S. 
in Vietnam. The study of failure teaches humil-
ity, caution and the need to question assump-
tions. In the aviation industry, pilots,  managers, 
engineers and regulators study every major 
accident, hoping to learn from mistakes and 
pinpoint technological flaws that can be cor-
rected. As a result, aviation has developed a 
culture of safety that has driven accident rates 
to once unimaginable lows.
We can accomplish the same thing in the oil 
business, and it’s all the more important now 
that companies are drilling deeper and in more 
remote places than ever before. Dangers are 
greater and responding to problems is harder. 
We can’t afford to turn off the oil spigot. But we 
must take a more systematic, clear-eyed 
approach to drilling safety. Our special report 
is one small step in that direction.

Fence tech
Your ﬆory on the nogales 
border fence (“Mending Fences”) 
suggeﬆs there’s no eﬀecive 
technology for detecing 
tunnels. What about using 
ground-penetrating radar 
(GPR)? Tis technology has 
been used for years to detec 
the location and size of caves. 
Highway departments have 
used similar radar units to 
detec voids beneath exiﬆing 
roads. Te radar transceivers 
are quite powerful and portable, 
and sofware can provide a 
good image of voids to a 
considerable depth. You may 
wish to inveﬆigate this 
technology in a followup ﬆory.

I found your auguﬆ ﬆory on the 
nogales border fences 
intereﬆing, and I oﬀer another 
solution: over-the-horizon radar. 
originally developed by MIt and 
Motorola, the radar was part of 
a diﬆant-early-warning syﬆem 
that I helped upgrade in Canada 
and Greenland. Using this 
technology, you could count 
engines on a ﬂying aircraf, 
polar bears and other game 
walking on the ice —all up to 50 
miles away. I am sure it could be 
updated for use along our 
southern border.

Breakthrough 
Researchers at 
Germany’s 
Fraunhofer 
Inﬆitute have 
developed a 
camera 
optimized for 
“long wave” 
infrared 
radiation—the 
range that 
corresponds 
roughly to 
body tempera­
ture—that can 
operate with 
sharp resolu­
tion at room 
temperature. 
(Exiﬆing 
models 
generally 
require bulky 
and expensive 
cooling 
syﬆems.) Te 
new design 
uses “micro­
bolometers,” a 
type of sensor 
that changes 
elecrical 
resiﬆance 
when ﬆruck by 
incoming 
radiation and 
direcly 
outputs a 
digital signal 
that is 
converted into 
an image. 
Among the 
uses the 
researchers 
propose for the 
camera: early 
detecion of 
deer as they 
cross dark 
country roads.

weight exemption to allow the 1430­pound Transition to 
be classiﬁed as a Light Sport Aircraf, a consumer model

Chemiﬆs at the 
University of California, 
Irvine, have created 
“plaﬆic antibodies” that 
attack and neutralize 
dangerous toxins in the 
bloodﬆream. Te 
researchers formed 
tiny polymer caﬆs of 
bee-venom peptides 
and then injeced the 
new nanoparticles into 
mice already exposed 
to the venom. Te 
plaﬆic antibodies 
encased the toxic 
molecules, slowing the 
venom’s spread and 
reducing deaths among 
the mice. Te chemiﬆs 
hope to expand the 
molecular-imprinting 
technique to attack a 
wide variety of 
pathogens.

n the late 1990s, U.S. Drug Enforcement Adminiﬆration (DEA) agents debated the exiﬆence of 
cra they called Bigfoots, semisubmersible cocaine-smuggling boats that ride low in the water 
to avoid deteion. ese days, law enforcement oﬃcials know these cuﬆom-built vessels 
exiﬆ—45 have been seized in the paﬆ three years alone—but no one in the DEA had seen 
anything like the cra discovered this year hidden in a jungle in Ecuador, near the Colombian 
border. Following intelligence leads, DEA agents and local police found a homebuilt submarine, 
the ﬁrﬆ proof that cartels are ﬁelding fully funional submarines to haul drugs. e diesel– 
eleric sub has engine snorkels, eleronics, a ballaﬆ syﬆem, a periscope and air conditioning, 
all of which speaks to a sophiﬆicated manufaurer. “It looks like they built secondary and 
tertiary syﬆems,” says DEA Andean regional direor Jay Bergman. A semi submersible can coﬆ 
up to $1 million to build, but hauls enough proﬁtable cargo (between 2 and 6 tons of cocaine) 
that smugglers will discard it aer a one-way trip and return home on commercial airlines, 
Bergman says. Now, DEA agents wonder if more advanced subs are making repeat journeys—
literally under the radar. “If it’s the ﬁrﬆ, it won’t be the laﬆ,” Bergman says. “In the maritime 
domain, there’s nowhere else to go.” — BRIAN THEVENOT

Few in the U.S. Coaﬆ Guard have as much experience 
cleaning oil spills as Capt. Roger Laferriere. A veteran of 
hundreds of spills—his ﬁrﬆ as an ensign during the Exxon 
Valdez crisis in Alaska—Laferriere served as incident 
commander for Louisiana for two months during the 
Deepwater Horizon cataﬆrophe. He was responsible for 
surface operations, including the removal of oil from the 
ﬆate’s 397 miles of coaﬆline, giving him ﬁrﬆhand insight 
into the Gulf of Mexico’s challenges. — Glenn Derene
How does the gulf spill diﬀer from 
the Exxon Valdez disaﬆer?
Te big diﬀerence, ﬁrﬆ of all, is that the 
oil is quite diﬀerent. Te Exxon Valdez 
oil was very thick and very viscous. Tis 
oil is acually a light to medium crude. 
By the time it goes through 5000 feet 
of water and then travels 50 to 100 
miles to the shore, 30 to 50 percent of 
the oil has acually evaporated. So in 
Valdez, we literally had waves and 
waves of oil coming to shore. We did 
not see that level of shoreline impac 
here because of the nature of the oil.
Which ﬆrategies applied in the gulf 
were learned during Valdez?
One thing we have learned is to use  
commercial assets in the response. In 
Valdez, they called it the mosquito ﬂeet; 
we hired the local ﬁshermen to help us 
pick up oil, transport ﬆuﬀ, move 
supplies and do surveying. We were able 
to take that model and superimpose it 
onto this spill, using ﬁshermen’s basic 
knowledge of the waterways, the 
currents and the way the waves behave. 
We couldn’t have done it without that.
What kinds of logiﬆical challenges 
are unique to the gulf cleanup?
One challenge we’ve had is that the 
marshes are very vaﬆ, and in some 
cases it takes a 2-hour transit to places 
where we need to initiate cleanup. Te 
other challenge that’s much diﬀerent is 
the weather. Te temperature here is  
in the 100s, so we have tremendous 
heat ﬆress. And in summer it’s not 
uncommon to get thunderﬆorms three 
or four times a day.
Have any ideas submitted by the 
public been especially successful? 
Tere was a local engineer who came 
up with a barge-based skimmer syﬆem. 
In other words, he took a barge, put 
some holes in the front of it and used it 
for acually skimming oil. It’s called the 
Big Gulp skimmer. Juﬆ the way it 
sounds: You tow it, and it skims oil. For 
this particular oil, the skimming 
technology was a really great idea. So 
BP built four of them, and we put them 
into service. Tey’ve done an outﬆand-
ing job because they can skim a lot of 
oil and move quickly in the water.

1400 pounds of gas cans, tools, dirt or newborn cattle. en,

Flexible Fievel
Close Cut 
 ese days, 
advances in manual 
razor technology are 
largely reﬆried to 
ﬆuﬃng more blades 
onto a shaving head. If 
you want to see real 
innovation, we 
suggeﬆ looking over 
at eleric-razor land. 
Take the Philips 
Norelco SensoTouch 
3D ($300)—a gadget 
that looks more like a 
sci-ﬁ prop than a 
shaver. ree 
articulating heads tilt 
and swivel around 
facial contours, and a 
close look reveals that 
the heads are lined by 
a series of holes of 
varying shapes, 
designed to pull in 
hairs of every length 
growing in every 
direion. (Philips 
engineers revealed 
that these ﬁne 
patterns were created 
using a liquid-
 elerolyte etching 
process—cool!) e 
shaver is waterproof, 
can handle gels and 
features a digital 
display that shows 
exaly how long you 
have le on a charge. 
For now, eleric 
razors are not nearly 
as popular in the 
U.S.—where visions of 
masculinity involve 
square-jawed heroes 
who probably shave 
with a bowie knife—as 
they are in gadget-
hungry countries like 
Japan. But we 
wouldn’t be surprised 
if shavers like this 
cause more men to 
reconsider their 
morning routine. 
Premium Streaming  When it comes to legal ways to ﬆream TV shows 
online, Hulu has long been the gold ﬆandard. But the ad-supported service is hobbled by a 
lack of outlets (it takes some techy work-arounds to view Hulu on anything but a PC) and 
a limited library. Hulu Plus partially ﬁxes these shortcomings—for a price: $10 per month 
(plain ol’ Hulu is ﬆill free) buys you access to a larger library and the ability to view video 
on a breadth of devices. In fa, if you have an iPhone or iPad, access to the Hulu apps 
alone may be worth the subscription fee. Still, despite the fee, the ads are ﬆill there.

Te big news for the sixth- 
generation VW Jetta is its 
larger back seat, which oﬀers 
almoﬆ as much rear legroom (at 38.1 inches) as  
a BMW 7 Series. Te car will get a hybrid powertrain 
in 2012 (prompting CEO Martin Winterkorn to gush 
recently about a “bridge to the elecric era” ), but for 
now, buyers muﬆ choose among three engines:  
a 115-hp 2.0-liter four ($16,000), a 170-hp 2.5-liter 
inline ﬁve ($19,000) or an eﬃcient 2.0-liter diesel 
($24,000) that uses a six-speed dual-clutch gearbox 
(DSG) to achieve 42 mpg. We’d wait until spring for 
the GLI ($24,000), which pairs the DSG to a 200-hp 
2.0-liter turbo and swaps the torsion beam for an 
independent rear suspension. — G.E. AndErson

         TINNY NO MORE
Kia’s Sportage follows 
its fraternal twin, the 
Hyundai Tucson, with 
subﬆantial revisions 
and clean ﬆyling. e 
V6 has been shelved in 
favor of a 2.4-liter 
four-cylinder with 
automatic and manual 
six-speed transmis-
sions. ere’s more 
power now—176 hp— 
200 fewer pounds and 
up to 31 mpg on the 
highway. e larger 
e Not So Mini
Expanding its lineup for folks 
who aually want to carry 
people and ﬆuﬀ, Mini will unveil 
the Countryman early next year. 
While a few inches shorter than 
the VW Golf, the Countryman 
comfortably seats four adults 
and oﬀers 41.3 cubic feet of 
cargo room behind the rear 
seat. Like the Mini Coupe, the 
new vehicle is handsomely chic, 
inside and out—juﬆ not so 
cozy. While it’s above average 
in terms of handling prowess, 
the big Mini feels less like a 
go-kart and closer to a 
four-passenger ATV. Optional 
AWD and short overhangs 
provide serious oﬀ-road 
potential. Cooper S models use 
the same punchy turbocharged 
inline four as the coupes, only 
now the engine makes 184 hp. 
Both manual and automatic 
transmissions will be oﬀered.

that Mini ﬆyle—about 30 grand

      Outlander Light
e Sport is an abbreviated version of Mitsubishi’s competent Outlander. It’s  
14.6 inches shorter and 400 pounds lighter (thanks in part to plaﬆic front fenders). 
Consequently, it comes only with a 2.0-liter 148-hp four-cylinder, which provides 
adequate, but not eager, thruﬆ. e moﬆ engaging model is the ES—with a ﬁve-speed 
manual gearbox—which runs about $19,000. e SE trim includes a shiable CVT and 
optional, lockable AWD. On California’s sinewy blacktop, the neweﬆ Mitsu proved 
worthy of its name but compliant enough for a long-term relationship. — BEN STEWART
engine will hardly be 
missed. Compared with 
the Tucson’s, the 
Sportage’s suspension 
has a slightly ﬆiﬀer 
edge. During a teﬆ drive 
on Seattle’s notoriously 
rough ﬆreets, we felt 
every change in surface 
texture, but the payoﬀ 
was a nimble and 
maneuverable feel that 
belied the Sportage’s 
relatively tall proﬁle. 
Optional features 
include an AWD syﬆem 
with a lockable center

driver’s seat and a huge 
panoramic sunroof. Kia 
will also debut the UVO 
infotainment syﬆem, 
integrating phones and 
MP3 players with 
voice-aivated 
commands. Overall, the 
new Sportage is more 
solid and roomier than 
the outgoing model—
but it should retain a 
friendly $19,000 entry 
price. — BASEM WASEF

Interbred Explorer 
Compared to crossovers, “traditional 
SUVs are becoming more of a niche 
produ,” George Pipas, Ford’s senior 
sales analyﬆ, says. at explains why 
Ford radically altered the formula for its 
all-new, ﬁh-generation Explorer, ditching 
archaic body-on-frame conﬆruion and 
myriad other mechanical components 
derived from pickup trucks. But while the 
unibody 2011 Explorer shares parts with 
the Taurus, the Flex and the Lincoln MKS 
and MKT, it rides on a unique version of 
Ford’s versatile D-platform. “It had to 
meet all of our truck durability-teﬆing 
requirements,” one representative said. 
“When people look underneath, they’ll 
ﬁnd more things unique to Explorer than 
not.” Under the hood, you’ll see either a 
3.5-liter V6 or a 2.0-liter turbocharged 
Four. Promising good fuel economy, 
optional AWD and a seven-passenger 
body that melds sedan and SUV ﬆyling, 
the Explorer, which ﬆarts at $28,965, 
has oﬃcially crossed over. — REX ROY
SHARPER EDGE

either 3.5 or 3.7

STIFF Competition
Aer years of ﬆubbornly oﬀering its high-performance 
model in juﬆ one body ﬆyle, Subaru ﬁnally makes the 2011 
Impreza WRX STI available as either a spoiler-sporting 
sedan ($33,995) or a ﬁve-door wagon ($35,995). at may 
be the only thing more ﬂexible about the STI, which has 
enough chassis changes to warrant appending its pink 
letter badges with “FF.” Stiﬀer sway bars, harder springs 
and a lower ride height are juﬆ the ﬆart. For added rigidity, 
Subaru even switched to ﬆeel-ball-type bushings— 
surrounded by rubber to minimize noise and vibration—
where the front control arms meet the body. As a result, the 
STI is more composed than its predecessor, making it a 
solid competitor to Mitsubishi’s Evolution. — JAMES TATE

TURBO CHARGES
Eschewing the

V6 for a 
turbocharged 
four-cylinder, 
Hyundai 
signiﬁcantly ups 
the Sonata’s 
performance and 
fuel economy. 
e Sonata 
Turbo’s 2.0-liter 
DOHC engine is a 
version of the 
turbo motor ﬁrﬆ 
seen in the 
Genesis Coupe. 
Modiﬁed for 
front-wheel-drive 
duty, it delivers 
274 hp at 6000 
rpm (along with 
269 lb- of 
torque between 
1800 and 4500 
rpm). at’s 137 
hp per liter, a 
notable mile-
ﬆone even 
among turbo-
charged engines. 
Hyundai predis 
EPA fuel- 
eﬃciency ratings 
of 22 city, 34 
highway and 26 
overall. at’s 50 
percent better 
than the outgoing 
V6, and better 
than V6-powered 
competitors. e 
six-speed 
automatic 
transmission has 
a short ﬁrﬆ gear 
for snappy 
oﬀ-the-line punch 
and oﬀers better 
eﬃciency than 
the ﬁve-speed it 
replaces. e car 
can be shied 
manually via 
either a console-
mounted shier 
or wheel-placed 
paddles, and the 
motor pulls 
cleanly across the 
rev band. With a 
class-leading 
power-to-weight 
ratio, the Sonata 
Turbo should 
ﬆart at under 30 
grand and hit 60 
mph in under 7 
seconds. Still

Sportbikes oen outperform

tempting to dismiss a 
middleweight like the Ducati 
Monﬆer 796 ($9995) as a bike 
for beginners. But doing so 
could be dangerous, consider-

that produces 87 hp and  
58 lb- of torque—which are 
relatively tame numbers 
compared to those of all-out, 
liquid-cooled superbikes. But 
the Monﬆer 796 weighs only 
373 pounds when equipped 
with its optional ($1000) ABS, 
resulting in a power-to-weight 
ratio that demands respe 
even from the experts.

P M  n e w c a r s
kit cars
This is a good time to be a gearhead 
with a DIY bent. Te words “kit car” once 
evoked VW-powered Mercedes SSK 
knockoﬀs and disillusioned shade-tree 
mechanics with half-built projects in 
their garages. These days, a car cus-
tomer inclined to pick up a wrench has 
more and better options than that sad 
ﬁgure from 20 years ago, the one coated 
in ﬁberglass duﬆ and becoming familiar 
with a Muﬆang II’s front suspension. 
“Technology cuts both ways,” says 
Dave Smith, president of component-
car kit manufacurer Facory Five Rac-
ing. “On one hand, it results in produc-
tion cars that aren’t serviceable—I open 
the hood of a new car and don’t even 
know what I’m looking at. But it also 
allows us to design build-it-yourself cars 
that are much more accessible than 
they used to be—and thus more fun.” 
In the past year and a half, Factory 
Five has sold 250 kits of its lateﬆ car, 
the ’33 Hot Rod, which evokes a 1933 
Ford but is equipped with modern under-
pinnings. “It’s the moﬆ successful model 
we’ve launched,” Smith says.
Meanwhile, Local Motors (founded in 
2007) is putting cuﬆomers to work at

its Phoenix microfacory assembling its 
ﬁrﬆ vehicle, the Rally Fighter. For Local 
Motors, involving customers is both a 
requirement—since the Fighter doesn’t 
meet all federal crash requirements, it 
can’t legally be sold as a completed 
car—and a way of self-selecing enthusi-
aﬆic buyers who’ll feel an aﬃnity for the 
company and their own cars. 
But you can’t juﬆ show up for 5 min-
utes and claim that you were involved in 
the build. Local Motors demands two 
weekends of wrenching. “You only need 
a basic level of mechanical aptitude,” 
says John Rogers, president of Local 
Motors. “Cuﬆomers won’t be doing the 
skilled work, like welding or applying the 
wrap. But the things you’re doing will 
help you underﬆand the car. At the end, 
if someone asks, ‘What’s that?’ you can 
honeﬆly say, ‘I built it.’ ” 
Factory Five’s kit cars demand a 
higher level of involvement, but Smith 
says advances in manufacuring allow 
a wide range of people to 
tackle a major projec. 
Today, you may be 
buying a kit, but it’s 
been CAD-engineered 
and CNC-machined to bolt together 
without generating a lot of profanity. 
“We’ve got equipment that was unheard 
of 20 years ago,” Smith says. “Te tech-
nology has enabled more people to build 
their own car. Now it’s an assembly job 
rather than a fabrication job.”
Even GM is capitalizing on the emerg-
ing do-it-yourself market with the new 
Corvette Engine Build Experience, where 
buyers of the Z06 and ZR1 go to the 
factory and help construct the engine 
that will power their own car. Moﬆ Cor-
vette cuﬆomers probably wouldn’t see 
the attraction of paying an extra 
$5800—the coﬆ of the program—to go 
to work in a factory. On the face of it, 
that idea kind of seems like paying your 
pool guy to let you scrub your own algae. 
But a certain segment of the car-buying 
population is going to get it. 
“The connection back to steel,  
to turning a wrench, is something that 
people want,” Smith says. “People are 
looking for a project, something they 
can do.”

n a stark morning last april at latitude 
88 degrees north, John Huston and Tyler Fish 
were crossing the Arctic ice cap in a bid to 
become the first confirmed Americans to ski 
unsupported to the North Pole. The two men, 
both in their mid-30s, from Chicago and Ely, 
Minn., respectively, wore backpacks and har-
nesses attached to sleds laden with hundreds of 
pounds of gear. At 10 am, the ice opened beneath 
Huston’s skis, and he plunged from light into 
the darkness of the near-freezing water below.
Huston and Fish may as well have been on 
the moon. Rescue was thousands of miles away, 
days distant. The Arctic environment—minus  
10 F, snow swirling across a white void—was 
inhospitably numbing. Even unearthly.
In fact, desolate polar regions have long been 
seen as analogous to outer space. From Siberia, 
where Soviet cosmonauts braved teeth-cracking 
cold, to the Canadian Arctic, where NASA still 
funds ﬁeld research for Mars exploration, the 
remote reaches of Earth offer a parallel to what it 
might be like to endure the alien environment of 
a moon or planet far away.
“Imagine two or more people leaving the 
 safety of a space habitat and going onto the 
Mars surface,” says Gloria 
Leon, who studies the 
polar–space analogy at the 
University of Minnesota. 
“That environment will be 
similar in many ways to 
what polar explorers face 
on Earth.”
The comparison is not 
just physical; polar set-
tings affect humans on a 
psychological level. After 
months alone on the ice, 
individ uals often experi-
ence  changes in their 
behavior, attitudes and val-
ues, says Leon, who co-founded the 
university’s Laboratory for Health and 
Human Performance in Extreme 
Environments in 1996. Since 1986 she 
has been studying expeditions, 
including Huston and Fish’s, to learn 
which qualities are held by explorers 
who perform well in isolation. 
“It takes a certain type of person to 
be able to stay effective on a polar expe-
dition,” Leon says. Using this informa-
tion, she hopes to one day help NASA 
form a more compatible, psychologi-
cally sound space crew for missions to 
the moon, Mars and beyond. 
Last April, when Huston plunged 
through the ice, Fish had to act in 
seconds before hypothermia inca-
pacitated his partner. He knelt—“I 
remember my knees getting wet and 
the ice tearing underneath me,” he 
says—and hauled the gasping man 
onto the ice. Huston stripped down 
and dried off in a tent, and 2 hours 
later, the pair stepped back into their 
skis and continued north.

IsolatIon RIsks ▸
On the ground ﬂoor of a University of 
Minnesota medical building, Leon 
and the extreme-environment lab’s 
director, Victor Koscheyev—a physi-
ologist who formerly worked on proj-
ects with the Soviet space program— 
lead studies on topics ranging from 
hypothermia and expedition-induced 
stress to heat tolerance. 
But as a psychologist, Leon focuses 
on the cognitive and behavioral chal-
lenges that polar explorers uniquely 
experience. Her research—applied 
over the years to a who’s who of polar 
explorers, including Will Steger, Ann 
Bancroft and Richard Weber—is 
based on surveys from tent-bound 
adventurers and structured psycho-
logical interviews before and after the 
expeditions. 
Each week on Huston and Fish’s 
journey, which was officially called 
the Victorinox North Pole ’09 Expedi-
tion, the two men answered questions 
about such topics as stress levels, 
mood, comfort, camaraderie, sleep, 
appetite and perceived physical exer-
tion. Leon also monitored their prog-
ress online at the expedition’s blog.
Her research indicates that drudg-
ery—not physical peril—can weigh 
most heavily on polar explorers. Plod-
ding for days across a stark white land-
scape is a lesson in dealing with 
monotony. “You enter into a different 
realm of existence on the ice,” says 
Huston, who trekked across Antarctica 
and Greenland on previous trips. “You 
get claustrophobic because you know 
you can’t leave.”
The effects of isolation on perfor-
mance are of great interest to NASA, 
which estimates that astronauts face a 
ﬂight to Mars lasting up to six months, 
followed by an 18-month stay on the 
Red Planet. In the agency’s Bioastro-
nautics Roadmap, a 168-page docu-
ment on risk-reduction strategies for 
space exploration, isolation is ranked 
alongside extraneous radiation, mus-
cle damage and bone loss. 
For space and polar explorers, the 
mental expedi-
tion can be just 
as challenging. 
“They are indi-
viduals, they are 
isolated, com-
munication will have a time delay,” 
says Robert Trevino, an aerospace 
technologist specializing in extra-
vehicular-activity systems at Johnson 
Space Center. “On the psychological 
side, there are a lot of similarities.” 
In the zone ▸
Leon’s research points to the unique 
formula required to thrive in an 
extreme environment. Many success-
ful polar explorers, for example, reveal 
a strong “absorption characteristic,” 
which is the ability, Leon says, to 
become so engaged in what you are 
doing that you do not get over-
whelmed by the greater task at hand. 
In 2001, explorers Liv Arnesen 
and Ann Bancroft skied and kite-
sailed across Antarctica on a 1717-
mile journey. Leon notes that, for 
Bancroft, becoming absorbed in the 
scenery was an important mental 
diversion during the 94-day trip. 
“Ann talked about slogging along but 
being drawn by the way the light 
would hit the ice or the view of multi-
color glaciers,” Leon says. “It showed 
how a person knows the reality of 
where she is but can become so 
engrossed with thoughts and sensory 
perception that they take over.”
NASA’s Bioastronautics Roadmap 
also cites psychological issues like 
interpersonal distrust, misunder-
standing, poor communication and 
lack of group cohesiveness as factors 
that pose grave risks to future mis-
sions. But Leon has observed that tak-
ing care of each other—physically and 
emotionally—can improve not only 
individual but also group welfare. 
During an all-female expedition in 
the early 1990s, for example, she 
interviewed skiers who divvied haul 
loads to take strain off a member who 
was slowed by a stressed leg. Coopera-
tion on minor hurdles, Leon says, 
helps teams reach larger goals. 
Key leadership qualities have also 
come to light through explorers’ dia-
ries: namely, a leader who takes a 
highly structured approach at the 
beginning, but who, over the course 
of an expedition, levels his or her 
authority to allow for a more demo-
cratic approach. Ernest Shackleton, 
Leon notes, used this technique.
Huston and Fish demonstrated 
one ﬁnal trait she has observed: the 
ability to “accept a setback, plan 
ahead based on the experience and 
continue on.” After more than 480 
miles, the men stood on the North 
Pole on April 25, 2009. They ate a 
meal of leftovers and drank scotch to 
celebrate their achievement. A few 
hours later, they boarded a Russian 
helicopter that hurtled south, carry-
ing them back to Earth.

For the past Few years, research-
ers at the Wharton Risk Management 
and Decision Processes Center at the 
University of Pennsylvania have been 
running a computer simulation to study 
how people choose to prepare for poten-
tial natural disasters. The simulation, 
called Quake, is a multiplayer game. All 
participants start out with a hypothetical 
$20,000 in cash and a house, and as the 
game progresses, they must make deci-
sions about how to use their money. A 
player can leave that money in the bank, 
earning a Madoff-like guaranteed annual 
return of 10 percent, or pay for structural 
improvements to help the house with-
stand an earthquake. The winner is the 
player with the highest net worth—cash 
plus the value of the house—at the end 
of the game, usually 10 virtual years.
Nearly everyone chooses to keep the 
money in the bank. The strange thing 
about this result is that the researchers, 
Howard Kunreuther and Robert Meyer, 
warn the players that quakes are highly 
likely—the game, after all, is called

Don’t confuse a 
house ﬁre with a 
wildland ﬁre that’s 
about to overrun 
your house. If you 
didn’t evacuate 
earlier—and you 
probably should 
have—your house is 
where you make 
your ﬁnal ﬆand. 
Shutting your 
windows againﬆ 
ﬂying embers is an 
obvious ﬆep, but 
juﬆ as important is 
to open the ﬁreplace 
damper to ventilate 
deadly gas and 
smoke that will 
precede the ﬁre. 
Make sure to shut 
oﬀ gas or propane 
lines, but ﬆop there. 
“Don’t shut oﬀ the 
water—we can use 
that—and don’t shut 
oﬀ the elecricity,” 
says Fred Stowers, a 
24-year veteran of 
the Los Angeles 
County Fire 
Department, who 
helped combat laﬆ 
year’s 160,000-acre 
Station Fire. “Turn 
lights on so we can 
see inside and tell 
the diﬀerence 
between things like 
drifing smoke and 
roaring ﬂames.”
Severe winter ﬆorms can snow 
people in for days at a time, while 
heavy ice and snow routinely bring 
down tree limbs and power lines. 
Homeowners in cold-weather ﬆates 
are used to breaking out the shovels 
(and even the roof rakes) for the 
hard task of snow removal. But a 
clear driveway isn’t an excuse for a 
drive—70 percent of winter ﬆorm 
fatalities occur in automobiles—so 
sit tight at home and ﬆay warm. If 
the power’s out, a generator will 
help keep the basic utilities running. 
But if you lack backup power and 
think you may be in it for the long 
haul, set up a “camp” inside your 
house with a tent, sleeping bags 
and your family all shut in a single 
room to consolidate heat. 
Long-laﬆing cold can burﬆ water 
pipes, so prepare the house by 
turning oﬀ the water supply at  
the source; then open the loweﬆ 
faucet and drain your pipes. But be 
sure to save some water for 
drinking, cooking and cleaning—
eating snow is a dangerous way  
to hydrate, and can lead to a  
case of hypothermia.

or a coaﬆal ﬆorm 
surge is imminent, 
the beﬆ advice is to 
move your valuables 
to a high ﬂoor, then 
evacuate. And if 
there are ﬂash-ﬂood 
warnings, be quick 
about it. Tese 
ﬂoods move faﬆ 
and tend to carry 
mud, trees and other 
dangerous debris 
with them. If you’re 
in a ﬂood zone—
check your address 
with the FEMA Map 
Service Center (msc 
.fema.gov) to ﬁnd 
out—plan an escape 
route ahead of time. 
And never drive 
through moving 
water; it can be a 
deathtrap. Almoﬆ 
50 percent of ﬂood 
fatalities are 
car-related. Don’t be 
lulled into a false 
sense of security by 
the term “100-year 
ﬂood,” either. Tat 
doesn’t indicate 
that a ﬂood will 
occur only once a 
century. What it 
really means is that 
every single year 
there’s a one-in-100 
chance of that level 
of ﬂooding. If you 
live in a ﬂood zone, 
the U.S. Geological 
Survey eﬆimates 
that you’ve got a 
one-in-two chance 
of experiencing a 
ﬂood in your 
lifetime.

check your sump pump
Watch to ensure 
that the ﬂoat 
rises with the water 
and triggers the pump. 
If water 
pours back 
into the tank, 
you may need 
to replace the 
check valve.
Every few months, 
remove the cover 
to your sump well and 
slowly pour water into

Quake. But players cling doggedly to that 
promised 10 percent rate of return. On 
occasion, the lab team has even told one 
of the players that the only way to win 
was to put the money into the house. 
Even then, he would typically delay for a 
couple of years, hoping to cash in before 
doing the home improvements. Then, 
predictably, an earthquake would come 
and wipe everyone out.
Before TrouBle STrikeS
The Quake study falls into the ﬁeld of 
behavioral economics, in which over 
the past 30 years it has been determined 
that people often fail to make rational 
economic decisions. In general, it 
seems, people are too eager to lock in 
ﬁnancial gains and too willing to gam-
ble that losses will never materialize. If 
this is unfortunate when it comes to 
retirement savings, it is positively dan-
gerous in a world riven by natural and 
man-made disasters. “People might be 
aware that there are going to be hurri-
canes or tornadoes or earthquakes,” 
Meyer says, “but they think the actual 
damage is something that happens to 
other people.”
After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a 
devastating midwest tornado season in 
2008 and deadly ﬂooding in Tennessee, 
Mississippi and Kentucky this past May, 
public awareness of disasters is surely 
at a high point. A 2009 Red Cross study 
found that more than half of all Ameri-
cans had personally experienced an 
emergency in which they’d either lost 
power for three days, had to evacuate or 
had to provide serious ﬁrst aid to oth-
ers. Yet the same survey found that only 
12 percent of Americans had taken ade-
quate disaster-preparedness steps. 
However, as the 12 percent who do 
plan ahead can attest, most disaster 
prep is pretty straightforward stuff. Jeff 
Swiney, a towboat pilot from Lafayette, 
La., has seen three major hurricanes hit 
his home in the past 10 years. His strat-
egy for weathering storms is easy to exe-
cute because everything has been fully 
planned out in advance. “Nothing’s 
basic when a hurricane is blowing down 
your house,” he says. “By then it’s too 
late, and that’s when you see people 
ﬁghting for the last bag of Doritos at the 
grocery store.” 
Once a person decides to take disas-
ter preparation seriously, the ﬁrst step is 
to assess the spectrum of threats. How 
would each type of disaster affect every-
thing, from the structure of your home 
to the contents of your fridge? 
From there, planning breaks down 
into two broad areas: general measures 
that apply to any situation, and targeted 
More Americans die 
in house ﬁres every 
year than in all 
natural disaﬆers 
combined. When in 
doubt, escape the 
building, but if you 
judge that you can 
safely mount a 
ﬁre-extinguisher 
battle, there are 
two rules you need 
to know. Rule one: 
Stay 6 feet from the 
ﬂames so you don’t 
torch the reﬆ of 
your house by 
air-blaﬆing a 
nascent ﬁre across 
the room. Rule two: 
People ofen forget 
rule one and make 
things worse, so 
keep your escape 
route to your back 
when you pull the 
trigger. More than 
50 percent of fatal 
house ﬁres occur 
between 11 pm and 
7 am (peak hours 
for all ﬁres are 5 pm 
to 8 pm), so 
pracice two ways 
out of every room 
at night. And make 
sure at leaﬆ one  
of them does not 
rely on a ﬆairwell, 
which can easily 
become a deadly 
vortex of gas, 
smoke, heat and 
ﬂame. “Homes are 
the only occupancy 
in the country 
allowed by code to 
have an open 
ﬆaircase,” says 
house-ﬁre expert 
John Norman, a 
retired chief for the 
Fire Department of 
New York. “We call 
them chimneys. 
Tey serve as 
channels for ﬁre as 
it moves upwards.” 
Finally, it may sound 
basic, but picking an 
outside rendezvous 
point is critical, so 
you can discover 
quickly who’s made 
it out of the house 
and who hasn’t.
Every room 
should have 
two escape 
routes. In 
upper-ﬆory 
bedrooms, a 
ﬁre ladder, 
such as this 
one from Firﬆ 
Alert ($70), 
can be a 
lifesaver.

tasks to protect against speciﬁc 
threats such as wildﬁres or hurricanes. 
On the general side of the ledger, sur-
vival experts suggest that families plot 
escape routes and make sure that they 
know how to contact one another in a 
crisis. It makes sense to list all of the crit-
ical systems that support your daily life 
and home (hot-water heater, boiler, 
water pump, phone, electricity, Internet) 
and learn how they work. Then you can 
create a backup plan in case they fail. 
Once an immediate threat has 
passed, the survivors of any natural 
disaster need to focus on securing 
warmth, water and food—and it doesn’t 
have to be difﬁcult. 
The NexT Day
Heat and electricity sound like two dif-
ferent challenges, but both needs can be 
satisﬁed by a generator and fuel. During 
almost any natural disaster, the power 
may go out and stay out for a while. In 
such a situation, generators can seem 
like miracles. In warm climates, a 
backup generator keeps food cool and 
your lights and a/c running. In cold 
weather, generators can power either 
electric space heaters or fuel pumps to 
keep oil burners running. But you can’t 
just buy any generator, stick it in the 
garage and expect to reap the beneﬁts 
when the lights go dark.

Larry J. Tanner, one

Texas Tech, who has 
inveﬆigated every 
major U.S. tornado 
in the paﬆ 12 years, 
disagrees. “You’ll 
never see me in

seen all sorts of 
things in ditches

2 x 4s, propane 
tanks, rolled cars.”

To earthquake-proof

an exercise in load management. 
Before you shop, figure out which 
household appliances you want to keep 
running, the electrical load (in watts) 
that each one draws and how many 
hours per day they need to operate. 
Many retailers feature generator calcu-
lators to help you pick the right model. 
Once you get the generator home, 
be sure to operate it safely. To avoid 
carbon-monoxide poisoning, never run 
a generator in an enclosed space—set 
it up outside and away from open win-
dows and a/c vents. Large generators 
work best when wired directly into your 
home’s circuitry. Consider hiring an 
electrician to install a transfer switch so 
you don’t have to plug individual appli-
ances in separately.
After shelter, water is the most press-
ing need in times of disaster. Most of us 
can’t survive more than three days with-
out it, and natural disasters often knock 
water-treatment plants off-line. During 
floods, contaminated water can also 
back-ﬂow into household water pipes. 
That means that an army of microbes is 
just waiting to infect your gut at exactly

Power outages are a 
routine side eﬀec of 
other disaﬆers, but 
sometimes a 
blackout can be a 
disaﬆer in itself. Te 
largeﬆ recent 
example in the 
United States was, 
of course, the 
Northeaﬆ blackout 
of 2003, which lef 
50 million people 
without power and 
caused 11 deaths. 
All told, it caused  
$6 billion in damage. 
Tat blackout was 
widespread, but it 
was hardly an 
isolated incident. On 
average, a dozen 
large-scale 
blackouts aﬀecing 
at leaﬆ 50,000 
people each occur 
every year. Like 
many disaﬆers, 
blackouts introduce 
issues of food 
spoilage, water 
contamination and 
exposure to heat 
and cold that only 
get more severe as 
the outage lingers. 
Te beﬆ defense is 
a generator, but it’s 
also important to 
keep a ﬂashlight and 
radio where you can 
easily ﬁnd them. In 
widespread 
blackouts, 
communication 
networks tend to

the time when local hospitals are likely 
to be overwhelmed. Treating water is 
easy: Strain it, then boil for 1 minute or 
treat with chlorine bleach (1 tablespoon 
for 10 gallons) and you’ll kill off most 
pathogens. But it’s better to think ahead 
by keeping a three-day supply of bottled 
water (1 gallon per person per day) on 
hand. Cody Lundin, survival instructor 
and author of When All Hell Breaks Loose, 
takes it a step further. If disaster looms, 
he suggests filling everything in the 
house—from bathtubs to 1-gallon zip-
lock bags—with tap water before con-
tamination begins.
Food is the least essential of the sur-
vival essentials. People have been known 
to survive three long weeks without food. 
But who wants to go through that kind 
of suffering? As with water, it’s relatively 
easy to build up a supply of food just by 
buying some extra dried beans, Camp-
bell’s soup and dried fettuccine every 
time you shop. Soon you’ll be stocked up 
with little pain to the billfold.
If you’ve lost power, open your fridge 
only when you absolutely need to and 
your food will stay pretty cold—espe-
cially if you can power it for a couple of 
hours every day with a generator. If you 
have time before the bad weather hits, 
organize your fridge, putting the most 
perishable food toward the front, and 
save the stuff in the freezer for last.
Securing your heat, water and food 
may be the starting point of disaster 
prep—but turning your home into a real 
bulwark against disaster takes more 
effort. Study FEMA maps to determine 
the disaster profile of your area and 
learn as much as you can about how 
ﬂoods, hurricanes, wildﬁres and other 
dangerous events can affect your house 
and neighborhood. Then invest your 
time, energy and money accordingly. 
You might build structural reinforce-
ments in case of an earthquake or prac-
tice smart landscaping to defend against 
wildfire—such measures are detailed 
elsewhere on these pages. And remem-
ber the lesson of Quake and simi lar 
studies: When it comes to natural disas-
ters, the biggest risk is assuming that 
they can never happen to you.

get out of town. 
Towboat captain and 
22-year Coaﬆ Guard 
veteran Jeﬀ Swiney 
has had multiple 
hurricanes hit his 
Lafayette, La., home, 
and he knows a thing 
or two about  
disaﬆer evacuation. 
“You’ve got to have 
predetermined 
trigger points and 
then ac on them,” 
he says. “Too many 
people wait until it’s 
too late, when the

they get hurt.” 
Second only to the

to bolﬆer your 
garage as well, 
Swiney says—he 
braces the entrance 
with diagonally 
placed 2 x 4s. 
“Garage doors are

it will take your

my brother carl grips
the rim of the steering wheel, takes a high step and hikes up 
onto the bench seat of the lanky 1959 Ford ﬁretruck. Grabbing 
a metal handle, he swings the driver-side door shut. It makes a 
ﬁrm, mechanical clank that sounds like the breechblock on a 
shotgun as it slides home. The truck has no door locks, seat-
belts or much of anything that we associate with modern vehi-
cles. Even its small brass key looks better suited to a wood 
cabinet than to an ignition switch. Carl ﬂips the battery kill 
switch, pushes in the clutch, pulls out the choke and twists the 
key. The truck rumbles to life with authority, ﬁlling the garage 
with the bygone but unmistakable odor of unburned gasoline 
vapor mingling with exhaust.
Sitting on the opposite side of the cab, I picture what the 
Ford was like when it was a working ﬁretruck. A volunteer 
would have dived into the cab and run through the start 
sequence, then thrown the parking brake and hit the lights 
and siren as he roared out of the ﬁrehouse in second gear, 
shifting to third as the truck cleared the apron at the street. 
My brother and I are not in such a hurry. We’re not ﬁremen, 
and our mission isn’t to extinguish a blaze. It’s to restore this 
ﬁne old machine. On a winter afternoon in rural Michigan, 
we’re taking it for a spin. Carl swings the ﬁve-speed shift lever 
hard to the right and up one notch. Easing up on the clutch, he 
gently backs the truck out of the garage and into the cold win-
ter air. “Needs a throw-out bearing,” he says, more to himself 
than to me. A telltale whine emerges from the clutch.
He snaps the shift lever straight back, then rolls ahead in 
ﬁrst gear. The old red Ford crunches the snow under its toothy 
eight-ply Goodyear Hi-Miler tires as we rumble down the long 
dirt driveway. With a sly grin, Carl turns the siren on and off, 
but his neighbor’s Angus beef cattle stand motionless and 
seemingly serene.
Soon we’re rattling along the dirt road that leads from 
Carl’s homestead to a paved county road. It’s an austerely 
beautiful landscape. The wind has sheared the snow off the 
ﬁelds, revealing the stubble of last year’s corn and soybean 
crops. Tracks from Carl’s test of the truck’s four-wheel drive 
crosshatch the snow in his own ﬁeld. Farmhouses, some of 
them nothing more than tumbledown wrecks, line the road. 
By current standards, the truck is primitive. The suspen-
sion is ridiculously stiff—we bounce over every rut and pot-
hole. Carl has to double-clutch between second and third. The 
steering has so much slop that my brother has to make con-
stant corrections to keep the truck on our side of the road. The 
heater has one setting: blowtorch.
No question, this truck is a relic from the distant past—
our past. It was built the year my twin brother, Carl, and I 
were born, in Hempstead, N.Y. It’s a sheet-metal barbarian 
with barely rounded corners, but to Carl and me it’s an 
American beauty.
➔Carl (lef) and 
I spent a lot of 
time looking
for trouble, 
checking for 
loose faﬆeners, 
damaged 
threads and 
missing parts.

The vehicle i Traveled so far To 
help renovate rolled off the assembly 
line on a summer day in 1959 at Ford’s 
then-new plant in Lorain, Ohio, a sto-
ried facility that made 7.5 million cars 
and trucks before it was shuttered sev-
eral years ago. The Ford was built as just 
a naked F-350 cab and chassis. After 
Lorain, John Bean Division, a ﬁretruck 
builder in Lansing, Mich., heavily modi-
fied the bare-bones Ford by adding a 
hulking Stahl utility-box body and after-
market NAPCO four-wheel drive. Most 
important, Bean installed a ﬁreﬁghting 
pump with a state-of-the-art high- 
pressure fog setting. It also wired in 
lights and a siren and built a diamond-
plate rear bumper wide enough for a 
ﬁreﬁghter to stand on.
Like all good finds, the truck just 
turned up. Carl was cruising the Inter-
net one afternoon to find parts for a 
1947 Ford grain truck that he’s restor-
ing and stumbled across an ad for the 
ﬁretruck. The photograph on the post-
ing showed it in hub-high snow and 
knee-high weeds, with a listing shack in 
the background. Carl was intrigued by 
the description: running condition with 
10,000 original miles, rare qualities in 
an unrestored 50-year-old vehicle. 
My brother immediately entered 
into negotiations with the owner, 
Shane Buer, perhaps the world’s most 
honest dealer of old cars and parts. 
Located in Dawson, Minn., Buer sent 
my brother more than a dozen photos 
detailing the truck’s flaws. The two 
men settled on a price, $2750, and 
Carl dispatched a car carrier to retrieve 
the ﬁretruck. “It sat outside for two 
years or so, but the only thing we had 
to do to start it was clean the points a 
little and spray a little gas in the car-
buretor,” Buer says. He was able to 
drive it right onto the car carrier.  
The Ford was delivered to Carl on 
our birthday. As soon as the old truck 
came off the trailer, my brother cor-
ralled some buddies to pump new life 
into it. In short order they replaced the truck’s coolant and oil 
and rebuilt the carburetor and installed a reconditioned fuel 
pump, new spark plugs and plug wires, a distributor cap, a 
rotor and ﬁlters for air and oil.
Now, ﬁve months later, after ﬂying from Philadelphia to 
Detroit, I’m driving through swirling snow to Carl’s. I guess I 
expected a hero’s welcome or to get razzed that I showed up 
after the heaviest work was done. Instead, neither happens. 
“Get dressed,” Carl says, as I step out of the rental car, “we’re 
cutting ﬁrewood.” 
That’s my brother, a man of few words. He’s a smart guy 
who has degrees in tool design and engineering and a mas-
ter’s in business administration. After high school, life took us 
on distinctly different paths. He moved to the Midwest to be in 
the heart of manufacturing. I split my time in the Northeast 
between journalism and construction, an oddly bifurcated life 
that I still maintain. Carl spent nearly 30 years in the industrial 
sector but now does data analysis for an insurance company. 
He’s stubbornly independent. He heats his house with wood, 
and he’s constantly building or remodeling something. The 
new workshop he just completed is bigger than my house. 
He’s always been that way. Restless. Productive.
After we pile the ﬁrewood, we start up a kerosene heater in 
the corner of the shop and go to work. Half the challenge of 
restoring an old truck to its former glory is just getting past the 
dirt. It’s to the credit of Ford’s engineers that they designed a 
vehicle that can still run 50 years after it was built, even though 
every spark-generating, air-moving or fuel-carrying part is 
clogged with crud. “The air cleaner looks like it came off my 
lawnmower,” Carl says. He plucks it out of a box of recently 
replaced parts. Everything in there looks like it belongs in a 
landﬁll for toxic waste.
Fortunately, other things about the truck are as tidy as can 
be. So complete are its documents that we know the date and 
mileage when Bean took possession (Sept. 9, 1959; 9 miles). A 
few weeks later, Carl and I were born. Such was the medical

trucks—then & now
technology of the day that the truck arrived with far more cer-
tainty than my brother and I did: My mother didn’t know she 
was carrying twins.
Sliding under the truck on a piece of cardboard, Carl 
shows me the grease points. Each zerk looks like a new form 
of undersea life: dirt coral. He demonstrates how he wants 
me to handle this job. First, he carefully scrapes away dirt 
with a putty knife and a brass wire brush, then he uses a den-
tal pick to open the end of the ﬁtting. Finally, he injects fresh 
lubricant with a grease gun. My tutorial complete, I set about 
lubricating each grease nipple I can ﬁnd. I lose track of how 
many I clean—the undercarriage is plastered with them. In 
this truck’s era, if an engineer felt that a part needed heavy 
lubricant, it got a zerk. 
  While I deal with the dirty ﬁttings, Carl tinkers in the 
engine compartment and debates whether we should replace 
a radiator hose. There’s nothing like a burst hose to strand a 
vehicle far from home. It feels good to work together again, 
like when we were kids. Between passing tools and parts, we 
catch up a bit: a divorce, a marriage, kids and stepkids. 
Call me old-fashioned, but instead of working on 
today’s vehicles with their artfully concealed fasteners and 
parts that require special tools, I prefer a truck on which only 
ordinary tools are needed and the heads of fasteners are easily 
accessible. Replacing the driver-side window is a joy. We 
remove the Phillips screws on a door panel and gain full access 
to the window crank mechanism. The rest of the job is a snap.
Even though we’re twin brothers and we share a love of 
working with our hands, our techniques couldn’t be more dif-
ferent. When I do mechanical work, I put on coveralls, gather 
my tools and plan my attack. To me, every job is about prepa-
ration, execution and cleanup. Carl, on the other hand, just 
dives in. If we were musicians, I’d be the classical pianist, and 
Carl would be the jazz soloist, a master of improvisation. 
Example: When I can’t remove a broken cap from one of the 
Ford’s brake-fluid reservoirs, my brother suggests a pipe 
wrench. The idea of using a plumber’s tool on an old truck 
strikes me as almost scandalous, but it works beautifully. 
My brother’s philosophy—that results matter more than

what we built
technique—emerged as far back as the summer of 1977, when 
he bought a ponderous ’58 Oldsmobile two-door that we nick-
named the Fish Tank for its tendency to take on water after a 
heavy rain. If there was a tool or makeshift repair that we 
didn’t employ working on that thing, I don’t remember it. We 
kept the Olds running for years and kind of started to enjoy 
the sound of water sloshing around in the quarter panels.
As the truck’s restoration took shape, Carl kept me abreast 
of its progress with daily e-mails. We begin calling it Canby, 
after the Minnesota farm town where it spent the bulk of its 
ﬁreﬁghting career. It was delivered there in the fall of 1959; the 
town paid $9600 for it, a handsome sum in an era when in 
Minnesota, for another $3200, you could buy a good house. 
The Canby News, a weekly paper that’s still in business, 
reported the truck’s arrival and ran a small picture of ﬁre chief 
Art Betts, wearing a plaid wool jacket over bib overalls as he 
stood solemnly next to the vehicle. Painted on the truck’s door 
was its identiﬁcation: Canby Fire Department No. 1. 
Paul Miller, an 85-year-old retired farm-equipment sales-
man, joined the Canby ﬁre department in 1947 and served for 
26 years. He fondly remembers the era. “When that whistle 
would blow, your heart went right up into your throat,” he says. 
“You ran as fast as you could to the ﬁrehouse.” Eugene DeWit, 
another volunteer, remembers driving Canby No. 1 to a ﬁre in 
a hog house. “I set it to fog and walked right in,” he says. “I had 
that ﬁre out in 2 minutes.”
I make another trip to Michigan a few months later and tail 
my brother as he drives the Ford to the Davis Auto Mart Spring 
Dust Off, a charity car show in Charlotte, Mich. At the show, 
the old machine holds its own among 
beautifully restored cars from the 
1930s through the ’60s. Old ﬁretrucks 
are just cool. “I feel right at home,” 
Carl says before going off to look at a 
Hemi Challenger.
Back at the shop, we tighten 
mechanical and electrical connec-
tions. Socking down those bolts 
makes for a cleaner garage ﬂoor and 
less oil spilled on the road. Likewise, 
getting the truck timed to 4 degrees 
before top dead center and replacing 
its Rube Goldberg coil with a new, 
more reliable version produces a vehi-
cle that runs ﬂawlessly.
Most of the work is pretty much by 
the book. Then we hit a snag, and Carl 
swings into improvisational mode. 
When the jack proves too short to ﬁt a 
pair of shocks, he grabs a concrete 
block, ﬂips it on top of the jack’s pad, 
works the jack under a crossmember 
and pumps up the truck body to gain 
the needed clearance. Left to my own devices, I’d probably saw 
a 4 x 4 to the exact dimension and place it on the jack. Fifteen 
minutes later I might have one of the shocks installed.
Maybe that’s what makes working on old vehicles so 
rewarding: You battle entropy using everything at your dis-
posal. Then you take your handiwork for a long drive. The very 
fact that it still runs nicely is a pleasure in itself.
Early evening shadows are stretching across the shop as we 
straighten up. A radio is tuned to a ’70s rock station, and the 
scene is so evocative of our teenage years that I confess I've 
become a little wistful. Carl urges me to take Canby for a drive. 
“Go ahead,” he says. “Take it for a good, long run.”
I back the truck out of the garage and head into town. For 
some reason, I feel more exposed without a seatbelt as a driver 
than as a passenger, especially as I get the truck up to its top 
speed of 50 mph. (The truck’s speedometer goes to 100 mph, 
but you’d have to drive it out the back hatch of a cargo plane to 
get anywhere near that velocity.)
Driving along with the windows down and the warm spring 
air billowing in, I get the truck’s full effect. The rude howl of 
six snow tires blends nicely with the growl from the glass-pack 
mufﬂer. Carl describes the serenade as “primal.” I agree.
Double-clutching helps me make the all-important shift 
from second to third, but the ﬁrst time I try it, I amateurishly 
bang the gears together. It sounds like a mower blade hitting a 
rock. It takes several miles, a deft touch and a couple of shifts 
before I have the second-to-third timing down.
Eventually, I turn around and head for home. It’s getting 
dark, and passing trucks have their lights on. Farmland scrolls 
by, and as I crest a rise, I meet Carl coming the other way in his 
snowplow truck. He must have been worried that I’d broken 
down somewhere and come out to look for me. Seeing him 
makes me smile. It does a brother’s heart good.

cies that will lead to better risk assess-
ment, more useful regulatory oversight, 
safer operating procedures and rapid cri-
sis response. The blowout was a punish-
ing lesson: 11 workers were killed and 17 
injured in the accident itself. The result-
ing oil spill damaged the economy and 
environment of the entire Gulf Coast. 
But out of this calamity can come 
changes that will reduce the chances of 
such a tragedy occurring again, not just 
in deepwater drilling but in other high-
tech, high-risk industries as well.
  Success Breeds Complacency  
A simple BuT CounTerinTuiTive 
fact led to the Horizon disaster: Wells, 
even ones drilled in deep water, had 
worked most of the time, just as the 
space shuttle and chemical and nuclear 
plants had functioned successfully, in 
some cases for decades. Although 
underwater drilling is complex and 
challenging, there are 3423 active wells 
in the Gulf of mexico, 25 in water deeper 
than 1000 feet. seven months before the 
blowout and about 250 miles southeast 
of Houston, the Horizon had drilled the 
world’s deepest well—an astounding 
35,055 feet. 
What was impossible just a few years 
earlier had become seemingly routine 
as Bp and Transocean banged out record 
ﬁrsts on the farthest frontiers of tech-
four senior executives—two from Bp and two from Trans-
ocean, to celebrate the well’s completion and the rig’s seven 
years without a serious accident.
What unfolded over the next few hours could almost have 
been written as a treatise in the science of industrial acci-
dents. As with the Three mile island nuclear plant partial core 
meltdown in 1979, the chemical leak in Bhopal, india, in 
1984, the space shuttle Challenger disintegration in 1986 and 
the Chernobyl nuclear plant explosions and ﬁre that same 
year, there is never one mistake or one malfunctioning piece 
of hardware to blame. instead, the Horizon disaster resulted 
from many human and technical failings in a risk-taking cor-
poration that operated in an industry with ineffective regula-
tory oversight. By the time the blowout came, it was almost 
inevitable. “it’s clear that the problem is not technology, but 
people,” says robert Bea, an engineering professor at the uni-
versity of California–Berkeley. “it was a chain of important 
errors made by people in critical situations involving complex 
technological and organization systems.”  
Bea and other engineers subject catastrophes like Deep-
water Horizon to the science of failure analysis for good rea-
son: studying industrial disasters can lead to understanding 
the root causes behind every accident, which is the critical 
ﬁrst step toward improving safety and preventing future big 
bangs. if we learn from mistakes, failure can drive innovation, 
both technical and organizational. “A lot of intelligence came 
out of Three mile island,” says larry Foulke, former president 
of the American nuclear society and an adjunct professor at 
the university of pittsburgh, knowledge that led to improve-
ments like better control-room ergonomics and the standard-
ization and accreditation of industry-wide training programs. 
since Three mile island, there has not been another major 
accident in the u.s. nuclear industry.

BP begins drilling 
the well on a 
5122-acre plot 
leased in 2225 for 
8$3 million. But the 
rig, Marianas, is 
damaged during 
Hurricane Ida and 
towed to a shipyard 
for repairs. It will 
take three months 
for its replacement, 
Deepwater Horizon, 
to start drilling.
British Petroleum (BP) leases 
drilling rigs owned by Swiss- 
based Transocean to tap a hydro-
carbon formation called the 
Macondo Prospect 52 miles south-
east of Venice, La. The Macondo is 
0$,222 feet beneath the ocean 4oor 
in water 5222 feet deep. The 
potential yield is 022 million 
barrels—a midsize ﬂeld. BP wants 
to complete the job in 50 days.
Mid-March
Transocean chief 
electronics 
technician Mike 
Williams asks senior 
subsea supervisor 
Mark Hay why he set 
the control-panel 
system to bypass its 
gas-shutdown 
function. According 
to Williams, Hay 
says, “The entire 
4eet runs them in 
bypass.” A year 
earlier Williams 
noted that the rig’s 
general alarm and 
indicator lights were 
set to “inhibited,”  
so they don’t 
automatically trip 
when gas or ﬂre is 
detected. In March, 
he also sees a worker 
holding chunks of 
rubber from the 
well—pieces of the 
crucial annular 
valve on the blowout 
preventer (BOP), a 
stack of safety 
valves atop the well. 
According to 
Williams, Hay says, 
“That’s normal.”
What Led to 
the BLoWout 

▽
an attitude that nothing bad happens, it leads you to believe 
that nothing ever will.”
It’s called hubris, and it set the stage for the Deepwater 
disaster. “In the event of an unanticipated blowout resulting 
in an oil spill,” read the exploration plan that BP submitted 
on March 10, 2009, to the U.S. Department of the Interior’s 
Minerals Management Service (MMS), which then managed 
and regulated offshore drilling, “it is unlikely to have an 
impact based on the industry-wide standards for using proven 
equipment and technology for such responses . . . ”
That was nonsense. Although offshore blowouts occur  
frequently—there were 173 in the Gulf of Mexico alone from 
1980 to 2008—there had never been one in deep water. In fact, 
neither BP nor any of its competitors had “proven equipment 
or technology” or any backup plan for a catastrophic failure  
nology and geography. The same off-
shore techniques and equipment that 
worked in shallow hydrocarbon forma-
tions seemed to function fine at ever 
greater depths and higher pressures. 
The offshore rush was on, and nothing 
was going to stop it. “When you think 
you’ve got a robust system,” says Henry 
Petroski, a professor of civil engineering 
at Duke University, “you tend to relax.”
Other industries have lapsed into the 
same sense of false security. “By the 
time of Three Mile Island,” Foulke says, 
“the nuclear industry had not had a 
major mishap in 25 years. When you get

 diameter “single 
string” of casing 
down the inside of 
the segmented steel

option: a liner/
tieback, which 
provides more

Morel notes: “Not

and complacency.) In the MMS era, oil companies were 
referred to as partners, and MMS ofﬁcials routinely received 
cash bonuses for meeting federal deadlines for offshore 
leasing. Although the Bureau of Land Management has a 
similar relationship with the oil industry, says Jeff Ruch, 
executive director of Public Employees for Environmental 
Responsibility, the consequences of a blowout on shore are 
much less severe. “The roots of the MMS,” Ruch says, “were 
to facilitate the work of its partners and to collect revenue—
at great depth. “The industry has not 
developed an oil spill plan for the low-
probability, high- consequence event 
when everything fails,” says Greg McCor-

ahead of its role as a safety cop. (After

Just 60 MMS inspectors oversaw rigs in the gulf. They 
examined oil spill response plans that were often boilerplate 
reproductions from one well to another. BP’s response plan 
for the gulf referenced seals and walruses, which aren’t 
found in that body of water, referred to a home-shopping 
network in Japan and listed scientists who were dead. No one 
noticed. The inspectors, Ruch says, “just made sure the com-

In 2009, when the MMS tried to make the program mandatory, 
much like the OSHA regulations that govern onshore drilling, 
the industry objected so vigorously that the program died. 
“The regulations are ﬁne as they stand,” says Terry Barr, a 
Lakewood, Colo.–based petroleum geologist who has spent 
over 30 years in the oil and gas industries. “But there’s an 
honor system—and this is where the industry is so unhappy 
with BP. When you send your paperwork to MMS, that’s a rec-
ipe for what you’re going to do, and you have to honor that. 
And 99 percent of the time, people follow what they say they 
are going to do. That was not the case in this well.”
  Blowing on the Dice   
OIL And MeTHAne gAS In deeP geOLOgICAL 
formations are under tremendous pressure—insert a straw 
and up they shoot. The deeper the well, the higher the pres-
sure, more than 9000 psi in wells 20,000 feet deep. during 
drilling, mineral- weighted mud pumped down the well lubri-
cates the drill string and ﬂushes rock chips to the surface. 
Most importantly, the dense mud’s hydrostatic pressure 
keeps the ﬂuids in the formation in check. Mud is, in fact, the 
primary line of defense against a blowout. 
If oil, gas or water enters the well during drilling because 
mud weight is too low, the well is said to “kick.” (Transocean 
testiﬁed before Congress that the Macondo well had kicked 
several times.) If the well is fractured or the cement bond 
between the casing protecting the drill string and the rock wall 
of the well isn’t tight, gas bubbles can roar up the drill string or 
the outside of the casing and reenter the casing at its overlap-
ping joints. even if the methane doesn’t come to the surface, it 
can “push the mud into the formation” with such power it frac-
tures the hole and creates a leak, says Philip Johnson, professor 
of civil engineering at the University of Alabama.

nicholas Taleb dubbed black swans—a common term in the 
Azerbaijan and for pushing the limits of 
technology in the remotest reaches of 
Alaska and the deepest waters of the gulf 
of Mexico—“the tough stuff that others 
cannot or choose not to do,” according 
to former BP chief executive ofﬁcer Tony 
Hayward. Within the industry, the com-
pany was notorious for its cavalier 
approach to safety. According to the Cen-
ter for Public Integrity, from June 2007 to 
February 2010, BP’s reﬁneries in Texas 
City, Texas, and Toledo, Ohio, accounted 
for 829 of 851 industry-wide safety viola-
tions identiﬁed as “willful” by the Occu-
pational Safety and Health Administra-
tion (OSHA). These were reﬁneries, not 
oil rigs, but they demonstrate what OSHA 
describes as “plain indifference to . . . 
employee safety and health.” 
And deepwater was not BP’s ﬁrst sig-
nificant spill. In 2007, BP Products 
north America paid a criminal ﬁne of 
more than $60 million for violating fed-
eral environmental regulations in Texas 
and Alaska, including a 2006 spill on 
the north Slope of Alaska that resulted 
from BP’s failure to address pipeline 
corrosion. The 200,000 gallons of crude 
that spread across the tundra formed 
the largest spill on the north Slope. 
Here’s how Steve Arendt, a vice presi-
dent of ABS Consulting and an industry 
expert who worked with the Chemical 
Safety Board’s investigation panel on 
BP’s 2005 Texas City refinery fire, 
describes the BP corporate culture: “‘We 
have the matter in hand.’ It might be a 
northern european cultural thing, but 
BP was convinced that the Texas City 
accident was a one-off, rather than 
something systemic and pervasive. They 
were arrogant and proud of the systems 
they had in place. They were in denial.” 
executives of other oil companies 
told Congress that BP’s well plans were 
outside industry norms. “It certainly 
appears that not all the standards that 
we would recommend or that we would 
employ were in place,” said John S. Wat-
son, chairman of Chevron. Marvin e. 
Odum, president of Shell, concurred: 
“It’s not a well that we would have 
drilled in that mechanical setup.” 
The MMS had implemented a volun-
tary safety and environmental manage-
ment program for the offshore industry.

Workers pump 
cement slurry down 
the casing, then use 
mud to push it out 
the bottom and 1000 
feet up the annulus, 
to comply with MMS 
regulations for 
sealing a hydro-
carbon-bearing zone. 
Halliburton, the 
cement contractor, 
uses nitrogen-
charged cement, 
which bonds 
strongly with rock 
but requires extra 
care and handling. If 
gas bubbles work 
into the wet cement, 
they can form 
channels that allow 
oil, gas or water to 
leak into the well.

Middle Ages for an impossibility, since at the time all swans 
were thought to be white. “The human perception of risk is 
an affective, subjective business,” says David Ropeik, an 
instructor at Harvard and author of How Risky Is It, Really? 
Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts. A classic black 
swan was the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union 
in 1986. The reactor had no containment dome—engineers 
deemed the safety feature unnecessary because a meltdown 
was simply thought to be so unlikely. The design ﬂaw, com-
pounded by operator error, poor training and a lax attitude 
toward safety, contributed to an explosion that released wide-
spread nuclear radiation. “Assessing risk is not a fact-based 
process of clear reason,” Ropeik says, “and subjective feelings 
always play a larger role than the facts.” 
Neither the oil industry nor the MMS addressed the added 
risks of drilling in ever more challenging environments. 
“There was a lack of a sense of vulnerability within the indus-
try,” says safety expert Arendt. “The gulf was one of the last 
cowboy environments, and the industry was blinded by its 
good performance.” Robert Bea adds: “Because BP and the 
MMS believed that the potential consequences were ‘insig-
niﬁcant,’ they were not prepared for the failures associated 
with the Deepwater Horizon’s operations, both in prevention 
and containment.”
  Normalization of Deviance   
AT THe RooT of BP’S CHoiCeS wAS wHAT BeA CAllS 
the normalization of deviance. The company had long grown 
used to operating at the margins of safety. it regarded red 
ﬂags as normal, and those red ﬂags cropped up repeatedly on 
the Macondo well, with the frequency accelerating in the four 
days before the blowout. 
A series of delays added to the pressure on managers to 
ignore warning signs. Though drilling had begun on oct. 7, 
2009, using a different rig, the Marianas, that rig was dam-
aged in a November hurricane. it took three months to bring 
in the Horizon and resume drilling. The well was scheduled 
for 78 days at a cost of $96 million, but 
the real target was 51 days. BP urged 
speed. Mike williams, Transocean’s 
chief electronics technician, told CBS’s 
60 Minutes that he heard a BP manager 
saying, “let’s bump it up, let’s bump it 
up.” But in early March that increased 
drilling speed fractured the well, forc-
ing workers to backtrack 2000 feet from 
the then-13,000-foot hole, plug the 
cracked section with cement, and carve 
a new path to the hydrocarbon-bearing 
formation, or pay zone. “operations 
were faster and cheaper,” Bea says, “but 
not better—the operation records 
clearly show excessive economic and 
schedule pressures resulting in com-
promises in quality and reliability.”
Those compromises began piling up 
on April 9, when the well reached its 
final depth of 18,360 feet below the 
rig—1192 feet below the last cemented 
steel casing. A well is drilled in sections: 
Roughnecks bore through rock, install 
casing to line the hole, pour cement 
into the gap between the casing and the 
surrounding rock, and repeat the pro-
cess with ever-narrower casing. To 
secure that final section, BP had two 
options: Run a single string of casing 
from the wellhead to the well bottom, or 
hang a liner from the last section of cas-
ing already installed and cemented, and

then slide in a second steel liner tube 
called a liner/tieback. The tieback 
option cost $7 million to $10 million 
more than the single string, but it was 
far less risky, providing double barriers 
to gas ﬂowing up the outside of the pipe. 
According to Congressional investiga-
tors, an internal BP document that 
appears to date from mid-April recom-
mended against single string casing. 
Nevertheless, on April 15 the MMS 
approved BP’s request to amend its per-
mit application, which claimed that 
using the single string made “the best 
economic case.” 
Although single strings are common 
in shallow water, they are rarely used in 
deepwater exploration wells like the 
Macondo where high pressures exist 
and the geologic formation is not well 
known. A Wall Street Journal investiga-
tion found that BP used the cheaper, 
riskier single string method in the gulf 
far more than other operators.
As casing is lowered, metal collars 
called centralizers position the pipe in 
the middle of the well bore to ensure  
an even cement job that contains no 
spaces where gas can squeeze through. 
On April 15, BP informed Halliburton’s 
account representative, Jesse Gagliano, 
that BP was planning to use six central-
izers on the final 1192 feet of casing 
string. Gagliano ran a computer analy-
sis of a number of cement-design  
scenarios to determine how many cen-
tralizers would be necessary: He found 
that 10 would result in a “moderate” 
gas ﬂow problem; 21 would reduce the 
potential gas ﬂow problem to “minor.” 
Gagliano recommended that BP use 21 
centralizers. Gregory Walz, BP’s drilling 
engineering team leader, wrote to John 
Guide, BP’s well team leader: “We have 
located 15 Weatherford centralizers 
with stop collars . . . in Houston and 
worked things out with the rig to be able 
to ﬂy them out in the morning . . . We 
need to honor the modeling to be con-
sistent with our previous decisions to go 
with the long string.”
Guide objected: “It will take 10 hrs to 
install them . . . I do not like this and . . . 
I [am] very concerned about using 
them.” On April 16, Brett Cocales, BP’s 
operations drilling engineer, e-mailed

  Shifing the Burden of Proof   
THe evenTs of THe week Preceding THe BlowouT 
point to what Allan J. Mcdonald, author of Truth, Lies and 
O-Rings: Inside the Space Shuttle challenger Disaster, calls 
switching the burden of proof, a reversal that leads to a kind of 
bureaucratic illusion. The closest analogy is the space shuttle, 
a system so complex and dangerous that a coldly factual analy-
sis would show the spacecraft presented a risk almost too high 
to tolerate. during the Challenger accident investigation, the 
physicist richard feynman asked nAsA for its failure rate. The 
answer: one in 100,000. feynman was incredulous, pointing 
out that this meant a shuttle launch every day for 300 years 
with only a single mishap, when the demonstrated failure rate 
was between one in 25 and one in 60. “nAsA’s ﬁgures were 
totally baseless,” Mcdonald says, “and were just backed into 
as a number that was acceptable to congress.”
Mcdonald, who is the former director of Morton-Thiokol’s 
space shuttle solid-rocket-motor project, says that the com-
pany’s engineers knew there was a problem with the shuttle 
boosters’ o-rings. The seals, which kept blistering gases from 
escaping the motors, could turn brittle and leak in tempera-
tures below 53 degrees fahrenheit. on the morning of Jan. 
28, 1986, the temperature in cape canaveral was 36 degrees. 
But the company managers pressed forward—the mission 
had already been postponed six times because of weather and 
mechanical problems—and engineers were left having to 
prove the components would fail. “it’s a trap,” Mcdonald 
says. “is it safe enough to ﬂy? is the correct question, not that 
you have to prove it will fail. if you can’t prove that it will fail, 
then there will be zero failure rate!” if a system never fails, he 
explains, then why bother spending time and money on 
safety? That inversion of logic “changes the burden of proof, 
and that is a fatal mistake.” Thiokol’s engineers ultimately 
relented. The shuttle broke apart 73 seconds after launch.
By the time Halliburton’s gagliano ran his models about 
gas ﬂow and centralizers for the Macondo well, everyone but 
the drilling engineers was operating in a haze of justiﬁcation 
and rationalization. gagliano showed there might be gas 
leaks, and gas leaks increase the risk of a blowout. But the 
models didn’t prove that a blowout would occur.
deepwater wells have one ﬁnal line of defense: the blow-
out preventer (BoP), a ﬁve-story tower of valves atop the well 
bore that can, in principle, lock down and shut off a runaway 
well. The Macondo BoP, however, was severely compromised. 
one of its pipe rams—horizontally opposed plates that clamp 
around the drill pipe to block methane and fluids rising 
through the BoP—had been swapped out for an inoperable 
test version. The conversion is common in the industry, 
decreasing testing and operation costs but increasing risk. 
investigators also found that one of the BoP’s control pods 
had a dead battery, making it unable to receive the

neer: “But, who cares, it’s done, end of 
story, will probably be ﬁne and we’ll get 
a good cement job . . . so guide is right 
on the risk/reward equation.”
on April 17, BP informed gagliano 
that it had decided to use only six cen-
tralizers. gagliano then ran a model 
based on seven centralizers and 
reported to BP on April 18 that the “well 
is considered to have a severe gas ﬂow 
problem.” if BP installed the additional 
centralizers, it would cost an estimated 
$41,000 per hour for the completion 
delay. BP went with the six centralizers.
After a well is cemented, drillers rou-
tinely run a cement bond log, an acous-
tic test that measures how well the 
cement has bonded to the casing and 
surrounding formation. on April 18 a 
crew from oil services contractor

form the test. But BP told the crew it

Reach’s executive producer Joseph Tung

i

  In a sprawling industrial site, a mix of open, 
dust-swept killing ﬁelds, claustrophobic hallways and obstacle-laden vehi-
cle bays, 8-foot-tall mandibled aliens are cutting down team after team of 
Homo sapiens soldiers. Those aliens, called Elites, are not only larger than 
their opponents, they also possess force ﬁelds and advanced beam weap-
ons that emit crackling blue and red plasma bolts. The Elites are among 
the toughest of the Covenant, a confederacy of alien species united under 
the banner of religious fanaticism and galaxy-spanning war.
But the humans who are ﬁghting—and losing—are elite in their own 
right, cybernetic supersoldiers called Spartans. These commandos are 
decked out in their own force ﬁelds, which radiate from strength-enhancing 
powered armor. In the brutal calculus of this particular conﬂict, the aliens 
POPULARMECHANICS.COM
 
 
 

are stronger, but they should also catch more bul-
lets and shrapnel from rockets and grenades. This 
is supposed to be a fair ﬁght.
In the Kirkland, Wash., ofﬁces of Bungie, the 
studio behind the blockbuster series of Halo 
games, developers watch as thousands of these 
ﬁghts play out unequally. “We have heat maps 
that show, based on color, where people are 
dying a lot,” says Joseph Tung, Halo’s executive 
producer. “We can see which weapons are being 
used, how many deaths are occurring with each 
particular weapon. We mine quite a lot of hard 
data.” And the numbers spilling across computer 
monitors in Bungie’s converted supermarket 
headquarters are damning. It is mid-May 2010, 
and a week earlier Bungie had launched a free 
beta version of its upcoming Xbox 360 game, 
Halo: Reach. Since then, millions of players 
around the world have been putting the unﬁn-
ished product through its paces on Microsoft’s 
online network, Xbox LIVE. In a game mode 
called Invasion Slayer, in which two teams of up 
to six players—one side alien, the other human—
face off until one team scores enough total kills, 
the Elites are winning 60 percent of the time. A 
mere 10 percent discrepancy, but for the most 
anticipated game in the world, it’s a disaster. It 
points to the existence of an “exploit” that favors 
the Elites. Left unchecked, the exploit would send stat-
obsessed players to blogs and online message boards until 
the only people left playing Spartans would be suicidal, unin-
formed or stubbornly loyal to the human race.
Halo: Reach is Bungie’s ﬁnal installment in a series that 
changed the gaming industry and barged its way into pop 
culture (although Microsoft, which owns the franchise, can 
produce more Halo games). Collectively, the Halo games 
have sold more than 27 million copies and have almost  
single-handedly established Microsoft’s Xbox as the video-
game console of choice for serious gamers. Fan dedication to 
the franchise is legendary. And the games have made  
Microsoft a fortune. Halo 3, the last full game in the series, 
raked in more than $170 million in its ﬁrst day of release. 
That’s more than double the highest-grossing single day for 
a movie —$72.7 million for Twilight: New Moon, in November 
2009. So Bungie’s ﬁnal game is understandably a big deal.
Halo’s plot has always been a bit convoluted: There’s an 
interstellar civil war going on between factions of the Cove-
nant, and humans are caught in the middle. Huge galactic 
weapons of mass destruction called Halos threaten entire 
civilizations. Players inhabit the body of a messianic super-
soldier named Master Chief, who fights back against the 
aliens to ensure the survival of humanity. Reach is a bit of a 
risk, plot-wise, for Bungie. It’s a prequel, with no Master Chief 
as a central character. And it’s a tragedy—the team of Spar-
tans are defending the planet Reach against a Covenant 
assault in the year 2552, and true to their namesakes, the 
Spartans are making a heroic last stand. The end of the game 
is clear from the beginning. Reach is going to be destroyed—
and all of its human inhabitants are 
going with it.
The enemies in Reach have also 
taken a turn for the malevolent. 
Creative director Marcus Lehto, 
who has been with Bungie from the 
start, asked the Reach team to 
revamp the Covenant, replacing 
their bursts of English dialogue 
(much of it intended as comic relief) 
with guttural alien-speak and giving 
their weapons a more sinister look 
and feel. “We needed the Covenant 
to be mean and terrifying,” Lehto 
says. “This game is darker than the 
others. They needed to be the vil-
lains again.”  
But the dirty little secret to Halo 
is that its characters and plot were 
never the main reason for its addic-
tive appeal. Sure, the environments 
and art direction are stunning, but 
what’s given the series lasting 
impact is its online game engine, 
which allows players from around 
the world to battle it out in teams, 
play capture the ﬂag or engage in a 
free-for-all slaughterfest with every 
virtual soldier for himself. In an industry in which online com-
bat is the current coin of the realm (every title from Call of 
Duty: Modern Warfare 2 to FarmVille has some form of net-
worked gameplay), it’s easy to forget that this wasn’t always 
the norm. In fact, Bungie popularized the idea in Halo 2, the 
ﬁrst mass-market game to take full advantage of the Xbox’s 
Internet connectivity. 
And few game developers know how to attract dedicated 
players like Bungie does. Tung, who joined the company 
toward the end of Halo 2’s development, pointed out that since 
its release in 2004, Halo 2 has remained one of the top-played 
games on Xbox Live. That ended earlier this year, when Micro-
soft pulled the plug on online play for original Xbox titles. But 
Halo 2 players wouldn’t let go, refusing to shut their consoles 
down after the designated cutoff and forcing Bungie to keep 
its servers on for an additional 26 days. Six years and one gen-
eration of hardware after launch, Halo 2 was still an online hit.

creation of interactive environments, visuals and program-
ming of the engine—the core framework of code that forms the 
foundation for nearly everything else. But the closing stages of 
game development are always a frenzy of bug killing.  
Finding those bugs is the point of the massive public beta 
release. During an 18-day period, 2.7 million players logged a 
total of 16 million testing hours and uploaded 1.3 terabytes of 
screen shots and videos of moments that were glorious, 
bizarre, buggy or all of the above. The sheer variety of poten-
tial glitches is staggering. Textures, light sources and objects 
can blink in and out of existence; computer-controlled char-
acters might blithely ignore the bullets slamming into them; 
or the game may simply freeze up and go black. One of the 
more surreal challenges for Bungie coders was a King Kong–
size monster, called a Mule, whose skeleton kept inexplicably 
popping out of its body as it stomped after Spartans. Now 
consider that every new action of the millions of players opens 
up the possibility of yet another previously undiscovered soft-
ware error, and the scale of the task explodes exponentially. 
“If you’re making a movie, you can tailor the experience 
down to the smallest detail,” says Sage Merrill, sandbox 
design lead, who oversees the interaction between players in 
multiplayer modes. “For us, there’s no way we can test all the 
possible iterations of everything every player’s going to do 
and what’s going to happen. It 
becomes sort of this living entity.”
Eliminating errors is one thing, 
but getting the feel of gameplay 
right is another challenge alto-
gether. To keep the game interest-
ing, it must be not only polished but 
also fun to play—challenging with-
out being intimidating for inexperi-
enced players. Bungie engineers 
analyze a constant ﬂow of raw data 
to ﬁne-tune the engine, from larger 
trends to second-by-second analysis 
of exactly what kind of weapon a 
given player is using when he pulls 
off a streak of wins without dying. 
 requires a 
deft touch—each tweak can generate 
new bugs or trigger negative feed-
back. “We’ve learned through experi-
ence that if you change the rate of ﬁre 
of a particular weapon in the tiniest 
way, you will annoy someone,” Tung 
says. “There’s always someone who 
loved exactly how that weapon ﬁred previously. The whole time 
you’re moving multiplayer forward, you’re asking, How do you 
preserve what was great about it?”
Which is why a 10 percent win discrepancy is such a chal-
lenge. Bungie developers can boost the capabilities of the 
Spartans or degrade the strength of the Elites by degrees, but 
each change must be made with extraordinary care to keep 
bugs at bay and players happy. 
Still, Lehto and Tung maintain that the studio’s foremost 
goal is to make a game that its staff wants to play. Clichéd as 
that may sound, Bungie is a demanding, detail-oriented tribe. 
To make a game worthy of the staff, the last of the bugs must 
be exterminated and the balance between man and alien must 
be resolved. So at the end of the day on a Friday, after a week 
that saw some developers working as many as 16 hours at a 
stretch, a group marches upstairs to annihilate one another in 
the only conference room that hasn’t been annexed as an 
ofﬁce. This is a tradition of sorts, the Friday-night play test. 
They’re trying yet another custom-built mode pitting Elites 
against Spartans. And after spending years working on noth-
ing but Reach, they’re having a blast playing, of all things, 
Reach. A lucky grenade bounce or a one-in-a-million head shot 
evokes that universal Halo question: “Did you see that?!”
The ZBR clock is still ticking. It reads 18 days, 7 hours and 
30 minutes. That’s fewer than three weeks to turn 60 percent 
into a balanced 50, and to turn Halo: Reach into the industry-
redeﬁning masterpiece that everyone wants and expects it  
to be. There are still dozens of art-
ists and programmers in their cubi-
cles, working toward that goal. But 
upstairs, the conference room is 
howling. Maybe the Elites are still 
winning. Maybe not.

Halo: Reach aims to outgun its 
predecessors with an arsenal 
of new weapons and vehicles. 
Players can also engage their 
creative sides by cuﬆomizing 
their Spartan soldiers’ armor or 
by conﬆrucing environments

Reach allows any player to 
create enormous and complex

 For years, there have been three ways to get a shed: build it yourself, hire 
someone to build it or buy a prefab model. a new method—conﬆrucing a shed 
from a kit—combines the sweat equity of building from scratch with the simplicity 
of using facory-cut components. all that’s required are basic tools and novice-
level carpentry skills. It's like doing a jigsaw puzzle with inﬆrucions: Faﬆen the 
parts together in the right sequence, and voilà—a shed is born.

Aer framing each 
wall, we inﬆalled 
the tongue-and-
groove vertical-
board siding while 
the wall was ﬆill 
horizontal. is 
premium kit 
included red-cedar 
siding, but less 
expensive pine 
siding is also 
available.
We inﬆalled the 
windowless 
sidewall ﬁrﬆ, 
tipping it up into 
place and then 
screwing down 
through the 
bottom plate and 
into the ﬂoor 
frame. Once the 
ﬁrﬆ two walls 
were screwed 
down, we slid the 
second sidewall 
into place. is 
wall has two 
barn-sash 
windows, so we 
positioned it on 
the side with the 
beﬆ views. You 
need at leaﬆ two 
people to put up a 
shed kit, and the 
work would go 
quicker with three 
or four people.
Some labor- 
saving shortcuts 
kept the work 
manageable. For 
inﬆance, the front 
wall, framed for 
double doors, was 
inﬆalled laﬆ. 
Before doing that, 
we assembled the 
roof trusses—the 
precut raers and 
ceiling joiﬆs joined 
together with 
plywood gusset 
plates, which are 
glued and nailed 
across the joints. 
We then placed 
the two gable-end 
trusses on top of 
the sidewalls. at 
way, we didn’t 
have to li the 
heavy trusses up 
and over the walls.
Shed kits typically 
don’t include the 
foundation. We 
used 4-inch-thick 
solid-concrete 
blocks to support 
the 6 x 8–foot shed. 
Each block was set 
down on compaed 
soil, leveled in two 
direions and 
checked one againﬆ 
another. We 
shimmed up low 
blocks with 
2-inch-thick 
concrete patio 
blocks, cedar 1 x 8s 
or asphalt roof 
shingles.
We set the 
pressure-treated 
ﬂoor joiﬆs onto the 
mudsills and 
faﬆened their ends 
with 3½-inch-long 
nails. We used the 
plywood ﬂoor deck 
to frame the four 
shed walls, 
positioning the 
ﬆuds and rough 
openings for the 
windows and doors.
cedar vertical siding, two barn-sash 
windows and a transom window above 
double doors. This kit costs about 
$4800, not including shipping. The 
small kit joins the company's eight ﬆock 
kits ranging in size from 10 x 10 to 10 x 
16 feet, and in price from about $4300 
to $8300. ey are all available with 
either pine or cedar siding. 
Our shed came with everything 
except the concrete-block foundation, 
roof shingles and faﬆeners. It included 
plans, necessary to obtain a building per-
mit. Local governments oen have shed-
specific forms detailing the rules for 
”auxiliary ﬆruures.“ e permit applica-
tion fee is typically $50 to $100—and 
it’s a lot smarter to pay up and follow the 
rules than to be penalized later. 
Shed kits are ﬆruurally sound by 
design, so you shouldn’t run into road-
blocks. ere are juﬆ two major details 
to get right. Firﬆ, follow setback guide-
lines when you’re deciding where to 
build. Second, choose the right kind of 
foundation. is will be diated by the 
building’s size. A frame of pressure- 
treated landscape timbers ﬆaked into 
the ground may be all that’s required, or 
you may need to pour a concrete pad. In 
our case, the rules permitted a concrete-
block foundation. 
Tim and I built the foundation, then 
inﬆalled rooﬁng and trim on the 6 x 8– 
foot shed in a day. e parts ﬁt perfely, 
and the ﬁnished kit was indiﬆinguish-
able from a scratch-built cuﬆom shed. I 
packed up my tools and headed home 
feeling just a bit tired and sore, but 
proud of the building we’d le behind.

Shrink the upgrades to a shed, 
though, and the coﬆs are

typically laﬆ 20.) Half-round 
ﬆyles in 5- or 6-inch-diameter 
sizes coﬆ about $10 per 
linear foot, oen sold in 
10-foot seions. 
 WINDOW SHUTTERS
Funional shutters aren’t 
cheap, but on a shed with a 
single large window, only  
one ﬆately wooden pair is 
necessary. Consider  
Timberlane—with mortise-
and-tenon joinery and 
hand-forged hardware, these 
shutters are the real deal. 
Match the iron tieback 
hardware (aka shutter dogs)  
to the shed’s door hinges. 
 FL O W ER  BO XES
Build window boxes of 
rot-resiﬆant cedar or paint 
ﬆock lumber with an 
exterior-grade acrylic. Build 
the box in the shed and hang it 
outside as a teﬆ container for 
new plantings.

For a small roof, asphalt isn’t 
the only economical option. 
Slate or copper shingles have 
old-fashioned appeal and a 
rich aeﬆhetic. ey also age 
well. As a modern option, new 
synthetic roof ﬆyles can oﬀer 
a lifetime of performance.

Toolshed Splurges
With two gable-end 
trusses propped 
between the side 
walls, we inﬆalled 
the front wall. We 
tipped and faﬆened 
the gable-end  
trusses and inﬆalled 
ﬆandard roof trusses 
in between.
Our kit included sash windows on two walls 
and a transom window above the doors. 
e transom is the kind of detail that’s 
typically found only on cuﬆom-built sheds, not on prefab models. And 
the company supplied a pair of heavy-duty ﬆrap hinges to hang each 
swinging door. When considering a shed kit, remember that quality 
hardware is juﬆ as important as quality lumber.
We used precut pieces of ½-inch exterior-
grade plywood to sheathe the roof. e 
plywood is cut precisely to create a space 
along the roof peak for inﬆalling a ridge vent.
We then covered the shed roof with 
slate-gray architeural shingles, which we 
chose because they are much more 
attraive than ﬆandard three-tab shingles.

simple as it comes: two uprights 
and ﬁve shelves designed like trays. 
a ladder shelf can turn a room into a

in a laundry room. Bang it together 
out of plywood and construction 
lumber and it suits a garage, work-
shop or utility room.

of several days. Te payoﬀ is about 
21 square feet of easily accessible

Curb appeal is easy to achieve in 
the spring and summer. Pretty 
much any clean house with a decent 
front lawn looks okay. In the fall, it’s a 
different story. That rich brown mulch 
you put down last spring starts to look 
a little weather-beaten, and the ﬂowers 
you planted in May are way past their 
prime by Labor Day. en leaves begin 
to fall, and curb appeal vanishes over-
night. It’s enough to make you wonder 
why you worked so hard in the summer 
to keep everything looking nice.
Surprisingly, though, autumn is a 
great time of year to restore a land-
scape’s vitality. Almoﬆ everywhere in 
the United States, temperatures cool

Cold-Weather 
Curb Appeal
Last summer, we did a lot of landscaping and 
installed a new front door. e house looked good. 
en, in September, I was away for a week—and I 
couldn’t believe how drab it all appeared when I got 
home! Everything was brown and ugly, and it stayed 
that way until spring. How can I do better this year?
more conducive to yardwork. 
Begin with the lawn. If the grass is 
dry and brittle, ﬆart by applying 1 inch 
of water a week to help reﬆore its tex-
ture and color. And if you fertilize only 
once a year, do it in autumn. ere’s less 
weed growth, so the fertilizer does the 
moﬆ good for the grass, not the weeds. 
Applying it in the fall not only greens up 
the grass but provides carbohydrates 
for the plants to ﬆore over the winter, 
which helps them bounce back the fol-
lowing spring. e potassium in fall fer-
tilizer blends helps to improve the cold 
tolerance or, in horticultural parlance, 
the hardiness, of the grass.
Next, take care of the ﬂower beds. 
Refresh their borders by cutting along 
the edges with a round-nose shovel. 
Turn over faded mulch using a bow rake. 
As for ﬂowers and plants, fall mums, 
pansies and kale are a good bet to add 
color to the muted autumn landscape 
in almoﬆ any climate. en, if you live in 
the northern half of the United States, 
ask your garden center about varieties 
that are particularly cold tolerant. For 
inﬆance, Mammoth Mum was devel-
oped by the University of Minnesota for 
extreme hardiness. And, if you haven’t 
added them already, consider planting 
evergreens, especially easy-to-manage 
varieties such as yews.
Next comes the house. Spider webs, 
light fixtures filled with dead bugs, a 
weather-beaten entrance mat, and mil-
dew on siding and trim all conspire to 
make a house look 
uncared for—in any sea-
son. In autumn, these 
unattraive visual cues 
are heightened.
A quick once-over 
with a pressure washer 
or a morning’s work with 
a broom and a garden 
hose is enough to take 
care of most of these 
problems. Use a shop 
vacuum to take dead bugs out of elec-
trical ﬁxtures. Once the lawn has sprung 
back to life, the gardening work is done, 
and the house is clean, your place can 
look great all the way until next spring.
Battery Backup 
We loﬆ power laﬆ winter, and now 
I’m intereﬆed in setting up some 

Coming Up Short
backup power. I’ve heard about 
syﬆems that use batteries that are 
trickle-charged from the grid. It seems 
like a good idea, but how much can 
you really power with batteries?
ese syﬆems are very praical and 
are a great way to power seleed cir-
cuits—not an entire home—during a 
power outage. “e key,” according to 
Fred Banner, the owner of Banner 
 Power in Rockville, Md., “is to determine 
what you need to run and how long you 
typically need to run it.” Banner’s com-
pany installs backup power systems 
that consist of either a battery bank 
housed in a cabinet and an inverter or a 
battery bank paired with a ﬆandby gen-
erator. For moﬆ homeowners, he says, 
the essential equipment to keep run-
ning is the refrigerator, the heating sys-
tem, some lights, a sump pump and a 
well pump. In some cases a sewage 
ejeion pump is added to that liﬆ. 
Given that the average power out-
age will laﬆ only 3 to 5 hours, a bank of 
eight or 12 batteries is enough to han-
dle the elerical load. ere are several 
caveats. First, the system requires 
topnotch components that operate 
with peak eﬃciency. While you could 
probably cobble together a syﬆem from 
a local auto parts store and a home 
center, I wouldn’t recommend that. 
You’ll end up creating an ineﬃcient sys-
tem. Sure, it’ll supply some current, but 
ﬆandard automotive batteries will wear 
out quickly compared to deep-cycle bat-
teries that are designed for backup 
power. Even if you don’t care about this, 
you’re liable to damage appliances or 
machines with under-voltage. 
Also, when you’re choosing your sys-
tem, be sure you’re calculating the load 
for your speciﬁc appliances. An Energy 
Star refrigerator might only need to run 
a couple of hours a day to maintain its 
internal temperature, but an old clunker 
might require so much current from the 
batteries that it will quickly run down 
the syﬆem’s charge.
It’s logical to ask what beneﬁts this 
syﬆem oﬀers compared with a backup 
generator. “The transition to battery 
power is seamless, silent and occurs 
automatically in 8 to 12 milliseconds,” 
Banner says. For prolonged outages, 
you can run on a combination of battery 
and generator power during the day 
and switch to battery power at night. 
Battery-operated systems don’t pro-
duce carbon monoxide and, unlike a 
portable generator, which burns fuel 
even when it’s not supplying power, a 
battery backup syﬆem provides power 
only when called for.
A hybrid power syﬆem consiﬆing of 
a battery bank and a generator is obvi-
ously more expensive than a generator 
by itself. A bank of batteries, a cabinet 
to house them, a high-eﬃciency in verter, 
cable and related components will coﬆ 
at leaﬆ $1200, Banner says. Adding a 
small standby or portable generator 
would probably double that sum.
Replacing Hiﬆoric Siding
I was replacing the siding on my 
100-year-old house with cement 
board—until I received a ﬆop-work 
order from the town. e house is in a 
hiﬆoric diﬆri and, the town says, 
the old wood siding was supposed to 
be replaced with a similar material. In 
my opinion, the new siding is an 
almoﬆ exa subﬆitute for the old 
material. What’s your take on this?
Sorry to hear it. Few things can bedevil 
a homeowner like building codes, his-
toric or otherwise. Towns oen follow 
or adapt guidelines published by the 
National Park Service, which call for 
replacement only as a laﬆ resort. Clean-
ing, repairing or careful patching are the 
preferred reﬆoration methods for his-
toric ﬆruures. When siding muﬆ be 
replaced, the new material is supposed 
to be the same shape and dimensions 
as the old and made from a closely 
matching material. Unfortunately, in 
moﬆ cases a pretty good match juﬆ 
doesn’t pass muﬆer.
So just what is a conscientious 
home owner to do? The only way to 
know if the new siding will meet local 
 PROBLEM: Not enough 
 wire to splice. 
 SOLUTION: Use an  
 innovative new  
 conneor. 
Among the more 
annoying jobs that a 
homeowner can tackle is 
making a minor elerical 
repair or modiﬁcation in 
an older home. Usually 
the laﬆ inch or two of 
wire is beat up and the 
insulation is damaged. By 
the time you’ve cut back 
to clean conduor, 
there’s not enough wire 
le to make the new 
conneion. It’s pure 
fruﬆration.
Enter Ideal Induﬆries’ 
new in-line wire 
conneor, the SpliceLine. 
It’s a small tool-free 
conneor that’s simply 
pushed into place. Strip 
the end of the supply wire 
and slide the SpliceLine 
over the wire’s end. Strip

ﬆandards is to ask the town’s hiﬆoric 
diﬆric its opinion. If you really need to 
replace the siding, see if you can set up 
a meeting at the house and have a sam-
ple of your proposed replacement mate-
rial on hand.
In many cases, though, old siding is 
in better condition than its surface sug-
gests. The paint may have failed 
because of age, poor application or 
moiﬆure-vapor movement from inside 
the house to the outside. It can be much 
less expensive to take care of problems 
that are causing the paint failure, rather 
than inveﬆing in new siding. Tat’s true 
with any house, not juﬆ a hiﬆoric one.
Chimney Creosote
My chimney has a thick formation of 
hardened creosote on its liner. I keep 
a nice hot ﬁre using dry hardwood 
(moﬆly oak) in my wood furnace and 
I brush out the chimney every year. 
I’ve even tried using granulated  
creosote remover. What can be  
the problem? 
Creosote happens, so to speak. It can 
form despite a homeowner’s best 
eﬀorts to burn wood cleanly. One prob-
lem can be a ﬆove or furnace that oper-
ates with an aggressive thermoﬆat that 
limits combustion air, says Ashley 
Eldridge, direcor of education for the 
Chimney Safety Institute of America. 
Firﬆ, limiting combuﬆion air makes the 
smoke rise more slowly. Te longer the 
smoke’s “residence time” in the chim-
ney, the more heat it loses, and the 
more likely it is that water vapor and 
combuﬆible byproducs will condense. 
Second, restricting combustion air 
increases smoke density. Tat speeds 
condensation, too. Over time, a thin ﬁlm 
forms inside the chimney—each burn 
cycle adds a layer, and creosote ﬆarts 
to build up. In the worﬆ case, this can 
result in a thick, glossy coating that 
chimney sweeps refer to as glaze. 
Te problem is worse in a chimney 
that runs up the side of the house, 
because its surface is exposed to cold 
temperatures and the smoke’s heat 
loss is all the more dramatic.
Your ﬁrﬆ ﬆep is to hire a certiﬁed 
chimney sweep to clean the ﬂue. If the 
deposit is shiny and looks like a glazed 
surface, it’s particularly dangerous 
because that means that it’s dense and 
fuel-rich. To avoid the risk of a chimney 
fire, don’t use the furnace until the 
deposit is removed. 
Next, contac the dealer who sold 
you the ﬆove or furnace (or the manu-
facurer that built it). Describe the prob-
lem. Te thermoﬆat could be defecive, 
or there might be a better way to build 
a ﬁre in it to optimize airﬂow. In moﬆ 
cases, a small, hot ﬁre is your beﬆ bet 
to reduce creosote. But that does 
require you to refuel  more ofen.
Shake, Rattle and Roll
Te pipes in our house have ﬆarted to 
rattle and squeak. How do we ﬆop 
this annoying noise?
A common cause of this problem is 
water hammer: You’ll hear a loud bang 
in the plumbing when someone shuts 
oﬀ a faucet, or when the solenoid closes 
on a dishwasher or a washing machine. 
(Tere are other sources as well.) Te 
bang is followed by a rattle in the pipe. 
The solution is to install a water- 
hammer arreﬆor, essentially a ﬁtting 
that acs as a shock absorber to cush-
ion the impac of water slamming into 
plumbing. In some cases, the arreﬆor is 
soldered into copper pipes, but in other 
situations, such as the supply to a 
clothes washer, it simply threads on. In 
houses equipped with a pressure regu-
lator on the incoming water line, some-
times the regulator needs to be adjuﬆ-
ed or repaired to reduce incoming 
pressure.
Pipe rattling and squeaking can also 
be caused by loose hanger ﬆraps, pipe 
hooks and supports. Sometimes sloppy 
inﬆallation is to blame, but more ofen 
the part simply works loose, allowing 
noise-creating pipe movement. In other 
cases a plastic or metal pipe rubs 
againﬆ the framing lumber that it pass-
es through, creating a squeaking noise. 
Moﬆ of these noises occur in inaccessi-
ble areas—inside walls or ﬂoors. If you 
can track the noise to an area in which 
the pipe is exposed, sometimes you can 

refaﬆen the pipe or inﬆall new hangers. 
For major remodeling jobs, you might 
consider a pipe-mounting syﬆem such 
as the Acousto-Clamp, a plastic pipe 
hanger that has a noise-insulating 
sleeve into which the pipe mounts.
A Sinking Feeling 
I found a hole in a ﬂower bed near the 
house’s foundation and for the life of 
me I can’t ﬁgure out what’s going on. 
It wasn’t there one day and then it 
suddenly appeared—if not overnight 
then in a couple of days. It’s about a 
foot deep. We don’t have problems 
like this anywhere else around the 
yard. What could it be?
Tere can be several causes. If it’s ani-
mal acivity,  there’s one likely indicator: 
Te dirt that came out of the hole will 
be piled next to it. If you don’t see a pile 
of excavated dirt, that doesn’t rule out 
animal acivity. It’s also possible that an 
animal has burrowed down from 
 another location and its tunnel has col-
lapsed. Check around the house for a 
concealed entry point, such as a porch 
or a set of wood ﬆeps. Call an animal-
control company if it turns out to be a 
critter problem.
Another cause of these mystery 
holes is when old clay-tile drain lines or 
bituminous-fiber sewer pipes (often 
called Orangeburg pipe) collapse. In 
other cases, tree roots grow into these 
pipes and push their secions apart. Soil 
above the gap can be washed down by 
rain and melting snow. For a while, the 
soil will be ﬂushed out of the drain, but 
eventually the roots and dirt combined 
will clog it. 
Because a collapsed sewer or foun-
dation drain can lead to severe prob-
lems, you need to do some careful  
excavation to reveal the problem. You 
may be able to tackle the repair, but it’s 
likely that you’ll need a plumber or a 
foundation drain company.

Winding Up
your Wiper Motor
Fixing balky WiPers can be as siMPle as a little grease,
or as coMPlex as installing a neW Motor. by Mike Allen
 ‘Tis a beautiful day. Well, except for that one dark cloud that looms ahead, 
direcly in your path through the countryside. relax, it’s a short summer cloud-
burﬆ, and you’ll pass through it in a minute or two. raindrops dance on your 
windshield, forcing you to turn on your wipers. Te blades, however, only twitch. 
Uh-oh. a few seconds later, the now indispensable rubber ﬆrips make a low-speed 
swipe across the glass, smearing the bugs and grit into a translucent paﬆe, 
groaning and squeaking every inch of the way. and then the coup de grâce: Te 
blades ﬆop cold direcly in your line of vision. Te good news is that you manage 
Hiding inside the 
wiper assembly is a 
gearbox, along with 
some elecronics.

2. On this truck, 
the reﬆing position 
of the wiper blades 
on the windshield 
is trimmed out by 
loosening the 
transmission arm 
and sliding the 
pivot lef and right, 
because the wiper 
arm only indexes 
on the shaf in one 
position.
1. Removing the 
cowl trim might 
make it easier to 
access all the 
whirly bits of the 
wiper transmis-
sion. A ﬁngerful of 
white grease on all 
the moving parts is 
a muﬆ whenever 
you’re working in 
the area. Check for 
sloppy ﬁt and loﬆ 
motion. Lube  
the pivot points  
as well.

spinning a ring gear and bellcrank that 
translate the motor’s circular motion to 
a linear one, back-and-forth. Simple 
joints attach the transmission arms to 
the  wiper pivot shaf, which is ﬁxed to 
the cowl by some sort of pillow block. 
Lack of lubrication, ice buildup or simple 
corrosion takes its toll and can slow 
things down. A loose joint will leave loﬆ 
motion, which can cause the blades to 
either ﬂop around or, worse yet, catch 
each other and get tangled.
Te bad news: Sometimes it’s diﬃ-
cult to access the area under the cowl.  
Worse news: If you go to the trouble of 
buying an afermarket service manual 
in the hope that it will provide some 
guidance—any guidance—as to how to 
remove the cowl, it probably won’t. Cars 
are complicated enough that not every 
single thing that needs to be taken 
apart can be ﬁt into a bound book, and 
straightforward stuff like bodywork 
Te fuse is okay, or you’ve replaced it 
with one that has the appropriate amp 
rating. Tere’s ﬆill no acion? With the 
wipers and ignition on, whack the motor 
assembly with the handle of a screw-
driver or a rubber mallet. If that gets 
things moving, you’ve got a bad com-
mutator or an open winding on the 
armature. When the motor parks, if the 
brushes are sitting on the bad segment, 
no current ﬂows. Whacking the whole 
business smartly can sometimes jolt 
things into motion. Because there are 
ofen a dozen windings on the arma-
ture, the motor runs ﬁne until the next 
time it comes to reﬆ on the bad spot. 
Mechanicals
Te mechanism on windshield wipers is 
as simple as could be. Inside that gear-
box on the motor is a simple worm gear, 
to safely ﬆeer to the curb and wait out 
the shower. But now you’ve got a prob-
lem—your wipers have quit.
Firﬆ Tings Firﬆ
Did you check the fuse?
Okay, Sometimes It’s 
Not Tat Simple
Acually, a wiper assembly that refuses 
to move might have a simple blown 
fuse. But usually fuses don’t blow on 
their own. Even at full ﬆall, the current 
draw of the motor should be well below 
the fuse’s rating. If the fuse is blown, 
odds are there’s something else wrong, 
like a shorted wiper-motor armature or 
faulty wiring anywhere along the har-
ness between the motor and the switch. 
Even a mechanical problem like a seized 
bushing can make a fuse eventually fail.

 How it works
ofen fails to make the cut. (Tink about 
it: Is it ultimately more important to 
know the torque values for the connec-
ing-rod bolts or where all the screws to 
the cowl are hidden?)
A favorite fricion point is the bear-
ing surface between the wiper shaft 
and its mounting block, which is ofen 
nothing more than a ﬆeel shaf running 
through a hole cast in plastic. A cor-
roded ﬆeel shaf can swell up and bind. 
It’s not a bad idea to dismantle the 
mechanism, wire-brush oﬀ any corro-
sion and reassemble the whole thing 
with a generous dollop of silicone 
grease. 
Disintegrating rubber mounting 
blocks and crumbling nylon bushings 
can leave slop in the linkage or cause 
excess fricion that makes the wipers 
run as though they’re coated with 
molasses. Tere’s no recourse but to 
replace these. Unfortunately, some of 
these parts have no part number from 
the dealer, requiring you to replace an 
entire expensive assembly—or impro-
vise. We bought a transmission arm, 
complete with bearing block and pivot, 
at NAPA for a ﬁfh of what the dealer 
wanted. 
Motor Woes
Is that motor assembly bad? Before 
you trot out and spend money on a new  
one, there are a few things to check 
out. Get a schematic diagram for the 
wiper system and parse out how it 
works. Generally, there are a couple of 
different windings on the motor for 
high- and low-speed operation. Tese 
will be supplied, respecively, with 12 
volts when the key is on and the wiper 
switch is in, duh, high or low. Start by 
back-probing the connector to the 
motor to see if the 12 volts are making 
it that far. If so, pull the connecor oﬀ 
and look for corrosion on the terminals. 
Check the park wire as well. 
Got voltage? You might have one of 
those wiper systems that switch the 
ground side of the circuit on and off 
(which I think they do juﬆ to screw with 
my head). In that case you’ll see voltage 
everywhere, even when the wipers are 
turned oﬀ . . . Back to the schematic.
As a laﬆ-resort diagnoﬆic, jumper 
12 volts direcly from the battery to the 
appropriate pin on the motor’s power 
connecor. If there’s ﬆill no sign of life, 
it’s time for a new motor. Before you 
unbolt the old motor, detach the trans-
mission linkage, which may have nice, 
plastic ball-and-socket joints, simple 
pins with nylon bushings and E-rings, 
or some other arcane method of carry-
ing the motion across the car to both 
wiper arms. 
Putting It All Together
Reassembly should be ﬆraightforward. 
Lubricate all moving parts, using sili-
Generally, the motor 
assembly is one of those 
things that have no 
user-serviceable parts 
inside and is inexpensive 
enough to make 
attempted repair 
pointless. If you have 
trouble ﬁnding a part for 
an oddball or collecible 
car, it may be worthwhile 
to open it up and poke 
around. Or maybe you’re 
like me and juﬆ prefer to 
know what went wrong. 
Te worm gear spins the 
ring gear as long as it’s 
powered. When the 
switch is turned oﬀ, 
power continues through 
the always-hot park 
contacs—the two 
ﬁngers that reﬆ on the 
copper ring—inﬆead of 
direcly from the wiper 
switch. 
Tere’s a gap in the 
copper contac ring. As 
the ring spins, the park 
ﬁngers drop into this 
gap, breaking the circuit 
and ﬆopping the motor 
at the same spot every 
time. If you shut oﬀ your 
wipers and they ﬆop 
immediately at some 
random spot on the 
windshield, the park 
contacs are probably 
corroded or broken. A 
sousing with contac 
cleaner and a little 
touchup with a 
typewriter eraser should 
reﬆore normal 
operation. be sure to

Other wipers have splines that mate in

ah yes, the missing zinc. Let me 
start with a primer on zinc/phos-
phorus antiwear additives: In the ’50s, 
when cars began to feature overhead 
valves and started making serious 
horsepower, the camshafts needed 
more aggressive profiles, which were 
prone to rapid wear. Tat’s when lubri-
cation engineers discovered the utility 
of zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP), 
which had previously been used in 
motors as an anticorrosive additive in 
modest quantities. Te phosphorus and 
zinc in this molecule are attracted to 
bare iron, coating the microscopic 
asperities (high spots) where the cam 
nose slides over the ﬂat surface of the 
tappet. this molecule- thick layer pre-
vents iron-to-iron contact. after a few 
hours of operation, the two surfaces 
burnish each other to a nice, smooth, 
low-friction surface, microwelding is a 
thing of the past, and everybody’s 
 happy. Without the zinc and phospho-
rus, this localized high pressure, com-
bined with the sliding friction, can 
microscopically weld the cam to the 
lifer, ripping out tiny chunks of metal. 
Te industry standardized on 800 or so 
parts per million (ppm) ZDDP content 
in motor oil, and engines lasted a very 
long time. In fact, ZDDP levels eventu-
ally rose to 1200 ppm by the ’70s.
Cut to the 1980s. Cars universally 
have catalytic converters installed to 
meet emissions requirements. some-
body ﬁgures out that zinc and phospho-
rus can contaminate the precious-metal 
reacor beds in the cats, reducing their 
Te Missing Zinc
I had a local speed shop rebuild the engine in my classic muscle
car to as near to the original specs as they could, including all-new 
valvetrain, pistons, rings and bearings. I prepressurized the oil sys-
tem, and the engine started right up. Within an hour’s driving, the 
engine started to lose power and misﬁre. one of the camshaf lobes 
had failed, making the egg-shaped cam virtually round. Tere was
a big divot carved out of that lifer to boot. Te shop says that I used 
the wrong oil and that I should have used a zinc additive as well.  
I used a premium oil, the same one I use in my new car.

to reduce internal fricion and improve 
economy, more and more engines use 
roller tappets or roller rockers, eliminat-

higher levels of ZDDP in the mix. 
Regardless of the petroleum compa-
nies’ take on this, moﬆ engine builders 
specializing in these specialty cars like 
to see that 1200-ppm number.
Back to your problem: Your engine 
builder should have provided you with 
instructions as to what oil to use, 
because there are options. Several com-
panies make boutique oils that meet 
that high-zinc spec of yeﬆeryear. Amsoil 
has several oils with appropriate levels 
of ZDDP in viscosities correc for your 
car. Some suggest using a modern 
diesel- rated oil—which I recommend 
againﬆ because there are a lot of addi-
tives in diesel oil that aren’t appropriate 
for spark-ignition engines, and vice 
 versa. If you can’t ﬁnd anything better 
at Walmart, however . . . Many main-
ﬆream petroleum companies have an 
oil marketed for older, high-mileage 
cars, and it usually has a healthy dose of 
ZDDP. If you need to know the ZDDP 
content of any product, ask for the 
MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) 
from the supplier, which will liﬆ every-
thing in the bottle.
My favorite solution for veteran ﬂat-
tappet engines has been around for 
generations: General Motors’ EOS. It 
was originally sold as an engine oil sup-
plement (get it?) for high- performance 
engines, and it has the correc amount 
of ZDDP in a form that won’t plug up 
the oil ﬁlter. GM dropped this produc a 
few years back, and I was hoarding my 
laﬆ six cans. Ten it returned as EOS 
Assembly Lube, not recommended as a 
supplement for routine use, but only for 
breaking in a new engine. If that’s what 
it takes to get it paﬆ the EPA and onto 
the shelves, ﬁne. Tere are other ZDDP 
additives on the market as well. My 
favorite is Comp Cams’ Break-In Oil 
Additive, coupled with the use of GM’s 
EOS or Comp Cams’ Cam and Lifter 
Inﬆallation Lube.
One ﬁnal thought: It’s easy for the 
engine shop to blame the oil, but there 
are plenty of other potential issues that 
can wipe a cam nose. I like to assemble 
high-performance engines that have 
ﬆiﬀ springs, lots of seat pressure and 
high-lif cams a little diﬀerently. I leave 
out the inner valve spring and even sub-
ﬆitute lower-ratio rocker arms for the 
ﬁrﬆ few hours. Tis will subﬆantially 
reduce cam-nose-to-lifter pressures, 
reducing wear. After a few hours at 
 lower revs , I change the oil to get out all 
the wear metal and inﬆall the reﬆ of 
the springs and the correc rockers. By 
then, the cam and lifer interface has 
been broken in properly.
One important caveat: Do not add 
extra ZDDP additives to an oil that has 
suﬃcient ZDDP already on board, in the 
time-honored American tradition of “if a 
little is good, a lot more is better.” 
Excessive ZDDP is corrosive, and the 
optimal level is right around the 1200-
ppm point already in most oils that 
meet the older ﬆandards. 
A second important caveat: Oils 
marketed as racing oils may have a dif-
ferent additive package and may have 
less detergent, dispersant, viscosity-
index improver and other good ﬆuﬀ in 
them. Tey’re really intended for racing, 
and their short drain intervals make 
them unsuitable for ﬆreet-driven vehi-
cles. To confuse the issue, some prod-
ucs labeled as racing oil may acually 
contain the appropriate additive pack-
age and would be suitable for street 
use. Caﬆrol GT Racing is one.
Tumper 
I bought some tires, and it seems one 
is bouncing now. I have taken my car 
back to the ﬆore and found out they 
had put ﬁve weights on my rim: three 
inside and two outside. Is this 
vibration normal?
Looking at the cellphone photos you 
sent me, I count a total of 2½ ounces of 
wheel weights on your rim. Tat’s a lot, 
but not excessive. Your tire technician 
is lazy, though—he’s used five half-
ounce weights, three on one side of the 
rim and two others on the outside. He 
should have used one ounce-and-a-half 
and another single 1-ounce weight, if 
for no other reason than that two 
weights are less likely to be thrown oﬀ 
the rim than ﬁve. Since the “bouncing” 
behavior you described suggeﬆs that 

P M  D I Y  a u t o  /// 
c a r  c l I n I c  q + a
the tire may be out of balance, I’d go 
right back to the ﬆore. Te technician 
needs to not only check for proper bal-
ance, but he also needs to make sure 
the tire is acually round. 
Here’s my plan for sorting it all out: 
Start by spinning the tire on the tire 
machine with a dial indicator, or at leaﬆ 
with a pointer on the tread. Total out-of-
round (the diﬀerence between the tire’s 
highest point and lowest point as it 
spins in relation to the pointer) should 
be 2 mm or less. If it’s more, mark the 
tire and rim with a tire crayon to peg 
where the tire was mounted relative to 
the rim and demount. Check the rim for 
roundness and true without the tire 
(which should have already been done). 
Discard the rim if it’s bent.
Now remount and air up the tire 120 
degrees from its original index position. 
Check for roundness again. If the high 
spot is ﬆill more than 2 mm higher than 
the low spot, break the bead and spin it 
another 120 degrees. If it’s still egg-
shaped afer that, toss the tire.
If the tire-rim assembly is perfecly 
true but the assembly still wobbles 
when mounted on the hub, carefully 
wire-brush the wheel and the mating-
hub surface to remove any ruﬆ, dirt or 
burrs. Smear the mating surface with 
antiseize compound and carefully 
torque the lug nuts with a torque 
wrench, not an air gun. Tat should cure 
any thumping. If the problem persiﬆs, 
diagnose further by mounting the tire 
on a diﬀerent corner of the car and see-
ing if the problem follows it. If so, it’s the 
tire or the wheel. If not, the axle’s spin-
dle shaf is bent.
Italian Tuneup
When the Check Engine light ﬆarted 
to come on in my minivan, I was 
worried at ﬁrﬆ because the former 
Chrysler-dealer-turned-independent-
repair-shop wouldn’t do warranty 
work anymore. 
I remember that in the 1950s 
some cars were prone to carbon 
buildup when driven too conserva-
tively. One ﬁx was to race the engine. I 
drive as fuel-eﬃciently as I can, so 

Got a car problem?

when the Check Engine light comes 
on, I accelerate as faﬆ as the car will 
go for a few blocks. Te light goes 
out, usually afer I ﬆart the car the 
next time. Is the problem carbon 
buildup? Is there a better ﬁx?
I’d ﬆart by getting a scan tool (which a 
lot of auto parts ﬆores will let you bor-
row for a half-hour if you leave your 
driver’s license at the regiﬆer) and plug-
ging it into the OBD II port to see what 
that trouble code acually is.
And a can of fuel-injecion cleaner 
will do a perfecly good job of removing 
carbon from fluffed-up spark plugs.  
So will a 100-mile trip at expressway 
speeds. Winging the throttle at low 
speeds trying to burn the carbon oﬀ of 
the plugs will only PO the neighbors.
Overheated 
I’ve had a chronic problem with my 
2003 Chevy Venture’s brake lights, on 
both sides. Te bulb (3057LL) ﬆops 
working because heat builds up and 
melts the plaﬆic that the metal 
contacs are attached to. Te ﬁlament 
is ﬁne, but the melted plaﬆic doesn’t 
hold the contacs together anymore. I 
have seen a lot of Ventures with a 
burned-out brake light. Is there a way 
of ﬁxing it without replacing the 
taillight assembly cartridge? Te 
bulb’s life is only a month or two. I have 
also tried elecrical lubricant on it. 
You’re not the only one with this issue. 
All I can ﬁgure is that you—and a lot of 
other Venture drivers—drive in heavy 
traﬃc a lot, and the heat from the brake 
lights juﬆ builds up. Aside from ventilat-
ing the housing with a drill (just kid-
ding—it probably won’t help), I have only 
one good solution: Replace the bulbs 
with LEDs, which will generate virtually 
no heat. You don’t have to do any wir-
ing, just pick up an LED that directly 
replaces  the 3057. I’ve seen these 
online for as little as 10 bucks. Be sure 
you get a bulb with red LEDs, not a 
generic white LED bulb. Te red lens will 
pass nearly 100 percent of the red light 
but will filter out all of the blue and 
green components in the white bulb, 
which means substantially brighter 
brake lights from the red bulb. 
A side benefit: LEDs illuminate 
immediately, but incandescent bulbs 
(such as your 3057) take nearly half a 
second, roughly 400 milliseconds, to 
come to full brightness. Tat will give 
following traffic earlier warning that 
you’re on the brakes.
Permanent Power
On my new Lincoln Town Car, the two 
cigarette plugs ﬆay on when the 
ignition is shut oﬀ. Tis leaves 
accessories like radar detecors and 
cellphone chargers to draw current 
afer the car is turned oﬀ, a sure way 
to drain the battery if you forget to 
unplug. Te dealer says the plugs are 
wired direcly to the battery. I would 
like to correc this if possible so I 
won’t have to pull out the jumper 
cables if I leave something plugged in.
Yup, and that’s why they’re called power 
points, not cigarette-lighter sockets 
anymore. At least that’s how they’re 
labeled on my schematic diagrams for 
all the late-model Lincolns. Any teen-
ager or decent mechanic can rewire one 
or both of your power points to power 
oﬀ when the key is oﬀ, perhaps by doing 
something as simple as moving a spade 
lug to a diﬀerent position on the junc-
tion box. At worﬆ, someone would have 
to splice a wire. 
But before you go to all that trouble, 
are you sure you really need to? A cell-
phone charger would take a couple of 
weeks to run your battery down.
You Big Sap
I’m forced to park under a tree. Early 
spring brings tree-sap drops that form 
on my hood and roof. Commercial 
producs claiming to remove these 
ﬆains don’t even come close to 
working. Cleaner waxes are simply a 
waﬆe of time and eﬀort. Any ideas?
1.   Don’t park there. (Duh.)
2.   Use a car cover.
3. Go to the auto parts store or 
department and get bug and tar 
remover. Follow the direcions.

GettinG all your media onto apple’s tablet can be tricky. Here’s How. by anthony verducci
move any File onto an ipad
 During the paﬆ few decades of personal computing, moving ﬁles onto 
our computers has been a fairly ﬆraightforward process. we’ve ﬆashed 
them on a drive—be it ﬂoppy, zip or usb—and then plugged the drive into a  
computer. Te machine recognizes the drive and, a few drags and drops later, 
the ﬁles are copied.
but apple’s ipad is a diﬀerent sort of beaﬆ, with remarkably few gateways 
for ﬁles to pass through. Te device has no usb jacks, and users typically need 
to use apple’s proprietary 30-pin jack in order to shuttle ﬁles onto the tablet. 
SOFTWARE 
SOLUTION: 
apps like air 
sharing Hd and 
dropbox make it 
easy to transfer 
large ﬁles from a 
pc to an ipad.
HARDWARE 
SOLUTION: 
apple’s camera 
connecion kit 
lets you plug 
a camera or 
memory card 
direcly into 
an ipad.
THE PROBLEM: out of the box, it can be diﬃcult 
getting many common ﬁle formats onto an ipad.

document to each app that 
you open it in, changes made 
to one version of the ﬁle will 
not show up in any others. 
Unfortunately, using e-mail 
as a gateway to the iPad is 
unwieldy and impractical for 
large—or large numbers of—
files. To handle these cases, 
you need another approach.
Hardware Solutions
 Photographers rejoice: 
Photos are the one area in 
which Apple has given us a 
hardware bridge to the iPad. 
The company sells a product 
called the iPad Camera Con-
necion Kit ($29), which allows 
users to easily offload large 
numbers of pictures onto an 
iPad. Te kit comes with two 
dongles that plug into the 
iPad’s 30-pin dock connecor. 
One of the adaptors acs as an 
SD memory card slot, while 
the other gives you a USB jack 
for plugging in cameras direcly. 
When a camera or memory card is con-
neced, the iPad automatically opens 
the Photos program and allows users 
to pick which pictures they want to 
offload. This is especially useful for 
travelers who are looking to pull pho-
tos from their cameras but are travel-
ing without a full-ﬂedged laptop (the 
photos can be transferred to a com-
puter later by syncing it up with the 
iPad). One caveat: Even though the 
Camera Connecion Kit can give the 
iPad a USB jack, it is one with limited 
funcionality. While it can also handle 
some USB keyboards and headsets, it 
does not recognize USB storage 
devices (I tried). 
Sofware Solutions
 A number of third-party apps are 
designed to link your iPad to either 
online ﬆorage services or your home-
base computer. Tese programs typi-
cally allow you to gather and open all 
sorts of ﬁles. One of the moﬆ powerful 
is Air Sharing HD, a $10 iPad app that 
tricks your computer into thinking your 
iPad is an external drive, allowing you 
to easily drag and drop ﬁles onto it. Te 
beﬆ part is that it’s done over Wi-Fi, so 
you don’t even need to plug the iPad 
into your computer. There’s also 
Dropbox, a free app that works in con-
juncion with the cloud-based ﬆorage 
service (2 GB of ﬆorage is free, 50 GB is 
$10 per month). You can play all sorts 
of media ﬁles from within the app. Still, 
this one has some kinks to be worked 
out—it crashed when I tried using it to 
push large movie ﬁles onto my iPad.
If you need to pull large numbers of 
PDF, zip or CBZ files (that last one is 
commonly used for digital comic books), 
I suggeﬆ CloudReaders. Tis free app is 
very easy to use and allows you to pull 
these ﬁles from a computer either over 
Wi-Fi or by using a USB cord to sync the 
tablet with iTunes. If you do it over Wi-Fi, 
the app gives you a URL to type into 
your computer’s Web browser. Go to the 
address and follow the inﬆrucions on 
pulling the ﬁles from your computer and 
sending them to your iPad. If you want 
to use CloudReaders over USB (the 
faﬆer method), go to the Apps tab within 
the iPad secion of iTunes, click on “File-
Sharing” and then selec “CloudRead-
ers.” From there, you can move these 
ﬁles direcly onto your iPad from within 
the familiar conﬁnes of iTunes.             pm
And to do that, they need to go through 
iTunes. In other words: Our decades of 
drag-and-drop training don’t apply to 
the device.
This reliance on iTunes as a gate-
keeper presents a signiﬁcant problem: 
Te sofware doesn’t do a very good job 
of handling many common types of 
ﬁles. Despite continual updates from 
Apple, iTunes ﬆill feels like it was only 
designed to get music (and maybe the 
occasional movie) onto iPods—not to 
shuttle PDFs, text documents and huge 
numbers of photos onto an iPad. For 
many of these tasks, iTunes can feel 
woefully inadequate. 
And that’s not the end of the iPad’s 
ﬁle problems. Once you’ve moved a ﬁle 
onto the tablet, it can be tough to ﬁnd it  
and do what you want with it. Tis is 
because, unlike juﬆ about every PC ever 
made, the iPad has no user-accessible 
syﬆem of folders that you can employ 
to organize and open ﬁles. Inﬆead, ﬁles 
tend to exiﬆ within the bubble of an 
individual app and can be accessed only 
from within that app.
Despite all this, you acually can get 
almoﬆ any type of ﬁle onto your iPad—
you juﬆ may need to go around iTunes.
First things first. There’s one very 
easy way to get smaller ﬁles onto your 
iPad: E-mail them to yourself. You won’t 
want to do this with massive ﬁles, or a 
massive number of small ﬁles, but send-
ing yourself a single photo or Word 
document as an attachment and then 
opening it on the iPad is quite simple. 
For picures, open the e-mail, hold 
your ﬁnger againﬆ the image for a sec-
ond and selec the “Save Image” option 
that pops up. Te iPad will save the pic-
ture in its pre-inﬆalled Photos app. 
If you open a text attachment from 
within the iPad’s Mail program, a button 
will appear at the top right of the screen 
that says “Open In . . .” Tap it and then 
selec a program. (If you want to edit 
text documents on your iPad, we rec-
ommend Apple’s Pages, a $10 word-
processing app. If you juﬆ want to read 
the document, the $1 GoodReader is 
adequate.) But be careful: Because the 
iPad shuttles separate copies of the

by Seth Porges
Te gaming world has noticed this 
success: By the end of this year, all 
three major consoles will have some 
motion-control capabilities. I’ve teﬆed 
all three. Here’s what you need to 
know about each of them.
 Nintendo Wii 
It has been four years since I bought 
my ﬁrﬆ Wii. And while the syﬆem’s 
motion-control abilities have been 
improved with the aid of the Motion 
Plus accessory (which allows for so-
called one-to-one motion control for 
some games), the tech is ﬆill the moﬆ 
primitive of the batch. Whereas the 
other syﬆems use cameras to track 
you or your controller’s exac physical 
position, the Wii uses a simple (and 
not nearly as accurate) IR emitter to 
monitor movement. 
But the aging Wii ﬆill has a trump 
card: four years’ worth of games. 
 Sony PlayStation Move 
Like the Wii, the Sony PlayStation 
Move ($50 to $100) add-on controller 
detecs movement and relative posi-
tion. But where the Move trumps the 
Wii is in its ability to tell the precise 
 
My mother recently confessed that 
she had never played a video 
game. Ever. Hearing this news, I did what 
any good son would do: I bought her a 
Wii. Within minutes of setup (on her hulk 
of a CRT TV), I understood the genius 
behind the system—despite countless 
news reports over the past four years 
attesting to the Wii’s appeal to a wide 
demographic, it took seeing my mother 
wave her way through a game of tennis 
to truly understand how Nintendo had 
managed to sell more than 70 million of 
these things since it was introduced in 
2006. For nongamers who may be 
intimidated by complex control schemes, 
the ability to literally jump right into a 
game is very appealing.

ﬆraight out of science ﬁcion. Te Xbox 
360 accessory used depth- perceiving 
cameras to transform ﬂailing limbs into 
onscreen acions. It worked so well we 
gave it one of our annual Breakthrough 
Awards. And it’s coming out as a real 
produc this November.
Kinec’s lack of a controller limits the 
types of games that can be made for it. 
But we would bet our ﬂatscreens that 
Microsof is thinking far beyond gaming. 
Kinec will be integrated into the Xbox’s 
robuﬆ media capabilities, oﬀering users 
a way to navigate through music and 
movies with a few simple waves. If Micro-
sof eventually builds the technology into 
Windows, it could change the way we 
interac with our PCs.
3D Power Draw 
Do 3D TVs use more power when they 
are showing 3D inﬆead of 2D images?
As part of a recent teﬆ of 3D TVs, we 
measured the power consumption of 
three models and found that all con-
sumed signiﬁcantly more power when 
they were displaying 3D images than the 
same image in 2D. Te teﬆed models: a 
52-inch Sony LED-lit LCD, a 46-inch 
Samsung LED-lit LCD and a 50-inch 
Panasonic plasma. For the test, we 
played a scene from the Blu-ray version 
of Monﬆers vs Aliens in both 2D and 3D, 
using the out-of-box default settings, and 
recorded the high and low range of 
 power consumption for each model. Our 
watt meter showed that the Sony’s con-
sumption fluctuated between 88 and 
116 watts while showing 2D, and 
between 120 and 139 watts in 3D. Te 
Samsung bumped from a 2D range 
between 109 and 155 to a 3D range of 
135 and 156. And the biggeﬆ 3D power 
premium belonged to the Panasonic 
plasma, which jumped from a usage of 
between 150 and 172 watts all the way 
up to a range of 290 to 332 watts. 
So, yes, you can expec a 3D TV to 
use a whole lot more power when it is 
asked to display 3D content. These 
spikes in power consumption are almoﬆ 
certainly the result of a 3D TV’s tendency 
to increase its brightness when it moves 
into 3D mode as a way of counteracing 
the dimming eﬀec of the polarized shut-
ter glasses. Te upshot of it all is that, 
with only a handful of 3D Blu-rays on the 
market, few people will be using this fea-
ture enough to signiﬁcantly aﬀec their 
power bill. At leaﬆ not yet.

“deadman” signal from the pod. This 
last-ditch control triggers a shear ram 
that severs the drill pipe, shutting 
down the well. Even with a charged 
battery, the shear ram may not have 
worked—one of its hydraulic lines 
was leaking. MMS regulations are 
clear: If there is a BOP “control sta-
tion or pod [that] is not functional” 
the rig must “suspend further com-
pletion operations until that station 
or pod is operable.” Eleven days 
before the blowout, the BP represen-
tative in charge on the rig noted the 
leak in a daily operation report and 
alerted the home ofﬁce in Houston. 
However, BP did not shut down com-
pletion operations, initiate repairs or 
inform the MMS.
Even a fully operational BOP has 
design flaws. A shear ram’s blades 
can’t sever the joints connecting the 
30-foot sections of drill pipe—and 
joints make up 10 percent of the string. 
In fact, internal Transocean docu-
ments show that when it bought this 
particular BOP in 2001, the company 
identiﬁed 260 separate ways it could 
fail. During a Congressional hearing, 
Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., asked: 
“How can a device that has 260 failure 
modes be considered fail-safe?”   
  Broken Chain of Command  
By APRIl 20, wITH THE unTESTED 
cement sheath in place on the ﬁnal 
1192 feet of casing, workers prepared 
to seal the Macondo well and move on 
to the next drilling job. A dispute arose 
during a planning meeting around  
11 am—11 hours before the rig 
exploded. Accounts vary: One Trans-
ocean worker testiﬁed that BP wanted 
to replace the protective column of 
drilling mud with lighter seawater 
before closing off the well; Trans-
ocean strenuously objected but even-
tually relented. Other witnesses say 
the argument was whether to conduct 
a negative pressure test—a procedure 
that reduces pressure in the well to 
see if gas and oil enter—even though 
it was not part of the drilling plan.
The argument revealed the inher-
ent conﬂict on the rig. BP, which was 
paying Transocean $500,000 daily to 
lease the Horizon, wanted to move as 
quickly as possible. with its costs 
covered, Transocean could afford to 
focus more on safety and well con-
trol. Safety expert Arendt believes 
some of the problems are systemic to 
offshore drilling. “Onshore, you have 
one plant owner and, normally, one 
large contractor to deal with,” he 
says. “Offshore, you have the lease 
holder, the platform owner, the drill-
ing contractor and one or two critical 
drilling and well service contractors. 
This creates the potential for mixed 
messages and a conﬂict between eco-
nomic versus safety priorities.”
Transocean conducted two 
negative- pressure tests; BP’s Don Vid-
rine and Transocean’s Jimmy Harrell, 
the two companies’ top officials on 
the rig, deemed them to be successful, 
and preparations began to install a 
cement plug to seal the well. At 7:55 
pm, BP engineers decided that the 
plug was holding, so they told Trans-
ocean workers to open the BOP’s 
annular valve to pump seawater into 
the riser to displace the mud, which 
was piped to the Damon B. Bankston, a 
supply ship tethered to the rig. At 8:58 
pm, drill-pipe pressures increased. At 
9:08, with pressure continuing to 
build, workers stopped pumping.
Here, there were eerie echoes from 
the union Carbide chemical plant 
spill in Bhopal, India, which killed an 
estimated 20,000. In Bhopal, water 
leaked into a tank containing 42 tons 
of methyl isocyanate, setting off a 
deadly chemical reaction. workers in 
the control room watched pressure 
build in the tank, but never shut the 
system down as three backup systems 
failed, and the deadly gas spread over 
a densely populated village. 
Remarkably, after a 6-minute hia-
tus, workers on the Horizon resumed 
displacing mud with seawater, 
despite the slew of signals—kicks and 
pressure spikes—that warned some-
thing was wildly wrong. “normally, on 
any well,” says the university of Tex-
as’s McCormack, “if you have a prob-
lem, you stop and solve it.” 
At 9:31, once again the workers 
stopped pumping seawater; at 9:47 
monitors detected “a signiﬁcant pres-
sure buildup.” A few minutes later, 
methane coursed from the drill pipe, 
transforming the rig into a giant unlit 
blowtorch. From the decks of his sup-
ply ship, Capt. Alwin landry saw 
“mud falling on the back half of my 
boat, kind of like a black rain.” Then 
came a green flash and a white liq-
uid—a frothy mix of mud, water, 
methane and oil—boiling out of the 
derrick. First Mate Paul Erickson saw 
“a ﬂash of ﬁre on top of the liquid” 
and then watched men jump from the 
rig, as a distress call came in. “May-
day, mayday, mayday! The rig’s on 
ﬁre! Abandon ship!”
“The scene was very chaotic,”  
rig worker Carlos Ramos told The 
Wall Street Journal. “People were in a 
state of panic . . . There was no chain 
of command, nobody in charge.” 
Throughout the rig, workers strug-
gled to reach the two usable life-
boats. Some yelled to lower them, 
some wanted to wait for more work-
ers, others simply leaped into the sea 
75 feet below.
On the bridge, Capt. Curt Kuchta 
argued with a subsea supervisor over 
who had the authority to hit the 
Emergency Disconnect System to 
activate the shear rams, thereby seal-
ing the well and detaching the rig 
from the riser. It took 9 minutes to 
activate the system, not that it mat-
tered—the BOP failed. The Horizon 
was never disconnected, oil and gas 
continued to surge up from below, 
feeding an inferno that soon engulfed 
the rig. Although the vessel had mus-
ter stations and emergency plans, 
crew members had never practiced 
safety drills without warning to simu-
late a real disaster. 
In the end, 11 men died, the disas-
ter cost BP billions, and the environ-
ment of the Gulf of Mexico may be 
irrevocably altered. President 
Obama’s ambitious plans to open up 
vast areas to offshore drilling have 
been shelved. But worst of all, says 
Ford Brett, president of Oil and Gas 
Consultants International, the blow-
out “wasn’t an accident in the tradi-
tional sense, like when someone just 
hits your car. It was an accident that 
was totally preventable.”

   boat builder
Name: JuStiN MartiN 
Location: N. FerriSburGH, Vt.
Age: 31  
Years on Job: 12
Juﬆin Martin never planned to build boats for a living. Afer 
high school, he took a summer job working with his older 
brother conﬆrucing composite canoes. Twelve years later, Martin is  
a head builder at Adirondack Guideboat, which specializes in a rugged 
boat that’s light enough to be portaged but large enough to carry 
three men, two dogs and a hunting bounty. In addition to the 
company’s legendary cuﬆom-built wooden guideboats, Martin and 
his brothers churn out more than 200 Kevlar boats each year. 
Working with his family is what Martin loves moﬆ. “We can build an 
entire boat without saying a word,” he says. “We’ve always worked 
together. I can’t imagine it any other way.” — Erin ScottbErg
Building 
a Kevlar  
Guideboat
1. Make a Mold   
Each Kevlar com-
posite boat ﬆarts 
with a 300-pound 
ﬁberglass mold caﬆ 
from one of the 
company’s wooden 
models. Molds take 
one month to build, 
and make up to 400 
boats. “It involves 
endless sanding and 
polishing,” Martin 
says. “Any ﬂaw in the 
mold is in every boat 
that emerges from it. 
It has to be perfec.” 
2. apply  
  SkiN coat   
Martin lays a dry 
sheet of ﬁberglass 
over the mold. 
Next, he pours in a 
pigmented polyeﬆer 
resin and rolls it along 
the entire form, using 
a paint roller and a 
small brush taped to 
a 2-foot ﬆick to get 
the resin into the bow 
and ﬆern. Afer the 
resin hardens over-
night, Martin sands  
it with 60-grit paper. 
3. layer keVlar   
Over the skin coat 
goes a solid sheet of 
Kevlar and a layer of 
overlapping 50-inch 
ﬁberglass squares. 
Tat’s followed by 
a second layer of 
Kevlar. Martin uses a 
corrugator to roll out 
the air between lay-
ers, then adds a ﬁnal 
sheet of ﬁberglass. 
4. FiNiSH build   
Afer adding the seat 
cleats and another 
layer of ﬁberglass 
over ﬂotation tanks 
at each end, Martin 
applies a gel coat 
to keep the outside 
color uniform. “We 
have about 20 
minutes to roll and 
paint the inside of 
the boat before it 
ﬆarts to cure on us,” 
he says. Finally, the 
mold is removed, and 
a deck and gunwales 
are added to give the 
boat ﬆrucure.
