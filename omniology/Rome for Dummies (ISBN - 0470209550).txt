Introduction
R
ome, the Eternal City, the capital of the ancient Roman Empire and
of the modern Italian state, is a city with many faces and myriad
charms. Its history is epic — the city vanquished Carthage and was itself
sacked by barbarians, saw the birth and development of the Catholic
Church, suffered fascism and World War II — and is written in its monu-
ments and ruins. Rome is also one of the most beautiful cities in the
world, and more tourist friendly than ever. With its noise, traffic, and
meandering streets, Rome can be bewildering. But you’ll find Romans
warm, welcoming, and ready to help ease you into la dolce vita, particu-
larly if you learn a few key words and phrases in Italian (we list some of
them throughout this book and especially in Chapter 17 and Appendix B).
About This Book
Whether you’re a first-timer or making a repeat visit to see sights you
missed the on first go-round, Rome For Dummies is designed to give you
all the information you need to help you make savvy, informed decisions
about your trip, while also guiding you to the discovery of known and
lesser-known facets of this exciting city.
You’ll be able to use this guide as a reference book to look up exactly
what you need at the time you need it. No need to read the entire thing
from cover to cover — you can just dive in at any point. No need, either,
to remember what you read: There are plenty of easy-to-find flags for
quickly locating the bit of info you want.
Some people spend more time planning their trip than they do taking it.
We know your time is valuable, so here, we happily do the work to help
ease you into a memorable Roman holiday. Unlike some travel guides
that read more like phone books, listing everything and anything, this
book cuts to the chase. We’ve done the legwork for you, offering our
expertise and not-so-humble opinions to help you make the right
choices for your trip.
Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — and that this is especially true of prices. We therefore suggest
that you write or call ahead for confirmation when making your travel
plans. The authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible
for the experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important

to us, however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your
surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets, all
favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
The structure of this book is nonlinear: You can open it at any point and
delve into the subject at hand. We use icons to guide you toward particu-
lar kinds of tips and advice (see “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this
introduction).
We include lists of hotels, restaurants, and attractions, and for each we
give you our frank evaluation. We divide the hotels into two categories:
our personal favorites and excellent choices that don’t quite make our
preferred list but still get our hearty seal of approval. Don’t be shy about
considering these “runner-up” hotels if you’re unable to get a room at
one of our favorites, or if your preferences differ from ours.
We use these abbreviations for commonly used credit cards in our hotel
and restaurant reviews:
AE: American Express
DC: Diners Club
MC: MasterCard
V: Visa
Note that Discover is not listed. The Discover Card is unknown in Italy,
so carrying one or more of the big three — American Express, Visa, and
MasterCard — is a good idea.
We also include some general pricing information to help you as you
decide where to unpack your bags or dine. We use a system of dollar
signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel (the price refers to
a double-occupancy room) or a full meal at a restaurant — including a
pasta or appetizer, a secondo (main course or entree), a side dish, and a
dessert (but no beverages). Note that within the restaurant listing info,
we give you the price range for main courses, or secondi. See Chapter 9
for a detailed chart telling you exactly what to expect in each hotel cate-
gory. Here is a table to help you decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
140€ ($182) or less
35€ ($46) or less
$$
141€–230€ ($183–$299)
36€–50€ ($47–$65)
$$$
231€–350€ ($300–$455)
51€–65€ ($66–$85)
$$$$
351€–450€ ($456–$585)
66€ ($86) and up
$$$$$
more than 450€ ($585)
Rome For Dummies, 2nd Edition

Prices are given in euros, with the U.S. dollar conversion; the exchange
rate used is 1€ = $1.30. Although we give you definite prices, establish-
ments sometimes change prices without notice. Also, in some cases a
price goes down but because of exchange fluctuations, the cost goes 
up. (See the “Follow the bouncing euro” sidebar for more on euro
exchange rates.)
Another thing you’ll find accompanying each listing is contact informa-
tion. Web sites are listed whenever possible. As for telephone numbers,
don’t be surprised if you see % 06-93021877 near % 06-290831. The
number of digits in Italian phone numbers is not standardized. Area
codes can have two, three, or four digits; the rest of the number may
have as few as four or as many as eight digits.
For hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map, a page
reference appears in the listing information. If an establishment is out-

Foolish Assumptions
We’ve made some assumptions about you and what your needs may be
as a traveler. Here’s what we assume about you:
 You may be an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Rome and wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy the Eternal City.
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when
determining whether to take a trip to Rome and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attraction. Instead,
you’re looking for a book that focuses on the places that will give
you the best or most memorable experience in Rome.
If you fit any of these criteria, Rome For Dummies gives you the informa-
tion you’re looking for!

Follow the bouncing euro
Only a few years ago, the euro was worth about 90¢. Now it has bounced back
strongly, to around $1.30. That 40¢ swing can make a huge difference. The 100€-per-
night hotel that seemed like a bargain at $90 a few years ago now costs $130 (if you
can still find it; for more about price changes and increases, see Chapter 4).

How This Book Is Organized
The book has six parts plus two appendixes. Each can be read independ-
ently if you want to zero in on a particular area or issue.
Part I: Introducing Rome
This is where you find in-depth information about Rome. It begins with
our rundown of the best of Rome in Chapter 1; continues in Chapter 2
with Rome’s history, culture, people, architecture, and cuisine; and ends
in Chapter 3 with climate information and a calendar of special events.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome
Here, we guide you through trip planning: budgeting (Chapter 4), decid-
ing on escorted and package tours, and choosing whether you want 
to make the travel arrangements yourself or work through an agent
(Chapter 5). We include Web sites throughout the section (and, indeed,
the entire book), because that’s where you often can find the best deals.
We also address the special concerns of travelers with mobility issues,
families, seniors, and gays and lesbians (Chapter 6). Finally, we give you
tips on all the other necessary details, from getting your passport to
thinking about your health (Chapter 7).
Part III: Settling into Rome
Rome may be eternal, but it’s far from dead. Here, we give you all the
logistical info on how to get around this bustling city and where to find
additional information (Chapter 8), as well as the lowdown on hotels
(Chapter 9) and restaurants (Chapter 10).
Part IV: Exploring Rome
This section provides our selection of what, for us, are the best features
and attractions of Rome (Chapter 11), its best shops and markets
(Chapter 12), and a choice of guided tours and itineraries through its
maze of ancient and modern treasures (Chapter 13). We also include
side trips to great destinations on the outskirts of Rome (Chapter 14).
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: Rome’s Nightlife
Here is where we give you tips on where to find the entertainment that
best suits your mood, from classical concerts and opera (Chapter 15) to
bars, pubs, and discos (Chapter 16).
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens allows us to squeeze in some extra stuff — Italian
expressions worth knowing (Chapter 17), our favorite Italian artists
(Chapter 18), and ideas for special souvenirs (Chapter 19) — that we
believe will complement your vacation and make your trip complete.

In the back of this book, we’ve included two appendixes. The first —
your Quick Concierge — contains lots of handy information you may
need when traveling in Rome. It includes phone numbers and addresses
of emergency personnel and area hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local
newspapers and magazines, protocols for sending mail or finding taxis,
and more. Check out this appendix when searching for answers to lots of
little questions that may come up as you travel. You can find the Quick
Concierge easily because it’s printed on yellow paper.
Appendix B contains a glossary of Italian words that will earn you warm
appreciation from the locals.
Icons Used in This Book
We use icons throughout this book as signposts and flags for facts and
information of a particular nature or interest. Following are the six types
of icons we use:
Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and great deals.
Best of the Best highlights the best Rome has to offer in all categories:
hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping, and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, rip-offs, and
other things to beware.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids. When the icon appears with a restaurant listing, it means that
high chairs and mezza porzione (half portions) are available, and we
spell out what other special attention the establishment provides. When
we use the icon with a hotel listing, it means that the hotel can provide a
crib or an extra bed or two (or the hotel has triples and quads). It also
means that the hotel might offer babysitting and other amenities suit-
able for children, such as a garden, swimming pool, or play area.
The Plan Ahead icon draws your attention to details or plans that you
should take care of before you leave home.

P
eople visit Rome for all sorts of reasons. Art lovers flock to its great
museums, the faithful make pilgrimages to St. Peter’s Basilica and
the Vatican, and others come to soak up Italy’s culture and atmosphere
(or just the sun). In Rome For Dummies, we give you our opinions on 
the best Rome has to offer. In this chapter, we list our very favorites.
Throughout the rest of this book, the Best of the Best icon marks the
places listed in this chapter.
The Best Museums
Rome boasts numerous museums, some vast and famous, others small
and catering to specialized audiences. Here is our short list of the not-to-
be-missed museums that contain internationally renowned masterpieces
and other mind-boggling beauties.
 The Vatican Museums top our list, for the monumental size of their
collections and amazing number of masterpieces. They include
dozens of rooms dedicated to Renaissance painting and sculpture,
as well as a fantastic Egyptian section, an impressive ancient
Roman collection, and ethnological art from all over the world. The
museums are also home to the Sistine Chapel (mentioned in the
next section). See Chapter 11.
 The Borghese Gallery isn’t very big, but it is a triumph of
Renaissance beauty. Caravaggio paintings and Bernini sculptures
are only a few of its many treasures. See Chapter 11.

 The National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme is a
huge museum completely dedicated to ancient Roman art. It con-
tains hundreds of artifacts unearthed during the excavation of
archaeological sites in Rome and the surrounding areas, including a
superb collection of sculptures and some breathtakingly beautiful
Roman frescoes. See Chapter 11.
 The National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia holds a wonderful
collection dedicated to the Etruscans, the mysterious predecessors
of the Romans. This is a unique treasure trove of Etruscan artifacts
and jewelry. See Chapter 11.
The Best Churches
Among Rome’s hundreds of churches, we considered not only the archi-
tecture and the importance of the artwork inside, but also the individual
charm and personality of each. Here are our top picks.
 St. Peter’s Basilica is the most famous church in a city filled with
magnificent churches. Its majestic colonnade and soaring dome are
a symbol of Rome as well as of the Catholic Church; treasures
inside include Michelangelo’s Pietà. See Chapter 11.
 Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the city’s only Gothic church, is filled
with artistic delights such as Michelangelo’s sculpture Cristo
Portacroce. See Chapter 11.
 The Sistine Chapel contains the most famous artwork in all of 
Italy. After the Mona Lisa, the ceiling of the chapel is probably 
the most famous single piece of art in the world. Decorated with
Michelangelo’s frescoes, it is accessible from the Vatican Museums.
Don’t forget your binoculars. See Chapter 11.
 The little chapel of San Zenone in Santa Prassede will take your
breath away. It is one of the oldest churches in Rome and com-
pletely covered with gilded mosaics. See Chapter 11.
 The church of Santa Maria in Trastevere is a splendid example of
Medieval and Byzantine art, which is rare in Rome after the general
baroque overhaul. It is also an excellent excuse to visit Trastevere,
a delightful neighborhood. See Chapter 11.
The Best Ruins
On your visit to the site of the world’s largest collection of ancient
Roman archaeological remains, deciding which places to visit can be a
trying affair. Here’s a list of our favorite and most atmospheric sites.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
10

 The majestic and austere Colosseum, where the Romans watched
“sports” (as in fights to the death) and chariot races, is Rome’s
most famous ruin and an impressive work of architecture. See
Chapter 11.
 The Roman Forum and the nearby Palatine Hill, containing the
remains of temples, public buildings, villas, and triumphal arches,
will take you back in time. They are particularly evocative on
romantic Roman nights. See Chapter 11.
 The Appian Way, the first road built by the ancient Romans, has
been transformed into the Appian Way Archaeological Park,
which you can visit on foot or by bicycle. Along the way are the
remains of tombs and villas that make the trip well worth the exer-
cise. See Chapter 11.
 The Caracalla Baths were among the largest in Rome and are still
an impressive sight. They also stage opera performances during
the summer. See Chapters 11 and 15.
 The Villa Adriana near Tivoli, outside Rome, is more than just a
villa. It is a huge complex of buildings, gardens, reflecting pools,
and theaters built by the Emperor Hadrian in the second century
A.D. In the mountains above Rome where Hadrian and a few hun-
dred friends could get away from it all, the villa remains an atmos-
pheric retreat. See Chapter 14.
The Best Hotels
We picked our favorite luxury hotels as well as our preferred moderately
priced and inexpensive accommodations.
 Hotel Hassler tops our list as the hotel with the best service among
Rome’s many wonderful luxury lodgings. Its location on top of the
Spanish Steps also makes it a unique place to stay. See Chapter 9.
 Presidents and stars stay at the Hotel de Russie, positively one of
the most elegant and classiest hotels in the world. Contemporary
design and exquisite good taste are coupled with the classic beauty
of its architecture. See Chapter 9.
 The Albergo Santa Chiara is one of the oldest hotels in Rome and
our favorite in the middle price range. The beauty of the palace and
the quality of the service make it a great value. See Chapter 9.
 The Hotel Arenula is the best of Rome’s budget hotels for service,
quality of furnishings, and location. See Chapter 9.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Rome 11

The Best Restaurants
Here is a short list of our favorite restaurants in Rome. We love many
more than those we describe here, and you’ll find the ones we left
behind in Chapter 10.
 For fantastic views over the Eternal City, with wonderful food to
match, try La Pergola. A meal at this elegant restaurant will be one
of your most romantic experiences in Rome. See Chapter 10.
 For a truly Roman outing — vetted by Alessandra, a Rome native —
nothing can beat Checchino dal 1887, a historical restaurant in
Monte Testaccio. See Chapter 10.
 The best enoteca (restaurant winery) in town is Enoteca Capranica.
Not only will you love the food, the wine, and the atmosphere, but
you’ll also get to enter one of the most charming Roman palaces in
the historic center. See Chapter 16.
The Best Buys in Rome
Shopping in Rome is great fun and a perfect excuse to stroll the
labyrinthine streets. You can also find some unique treasures, including
some great souvenirs.
 Select a pair of socks fit for a cardinal — or any other religious
item you might think of — from one of the shops in the center of
Rome. The vendors showcase a variety of items, from apparel to
artwork. See Chapter 12.
 Give yourself the pleasure of a handmade piece of gold jewelry. The
ancient tradition of goldsmithing is alive and well in Rome, and you’ll
find craftspeople working in a variety of styles, from reproductions
of ancient classics to contemporary designs. See Chapter 12.
 An antique print makes a wonderful gift — for yourself or a loved
one. This craft has been a Roman tradition since the Renaissance.
See Chapter 12.
 Get a picture of the pope from the huge collection at the Vatican
gift shop. See Chapter 11.
 Take your pick of fashion accessories — scarves, leather gloves,
handbags, wallets, watches, sunglasses — from the many local
designers. See Chapter 12.
The Best Daytime and Nighttime Outings
In our opinion, you shouldn’t leave Rome without taking part in at least
a few of the following adventures.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
12

 Go for a river cruise along the Tiber. The Compagnia di Navigazione
Ponte San Angelo organizes both romantic dinner cruises and day
excursions, including a great one to Ostia Antica. See Chapter 11.
 Take a walk by moonlight near the church of Santa Maria in
Aracoeli and up to the Capitoline Museums on Piazza del
Campidoglio for a unique view over the Forum. See Chapter 11.
 Book tickets for an opera performance at the Caracalla Baths, the
summer location of the Teatro dell’Opera. See Chapter 15.
 Enjoy a concert or a dance performance at the Parco della Musica,
the city’s recently opened state-of-the-art performing arts center.
See Chapter 15.
 Have a drink at one of Rome’s historical cafes, the best being the
Caffè Greco in Via Condotti, near the Spanish Steps. It still has its
original 19th-century furnishings and decoration. See Chapter 16.

U
nder the Roman Empire, all roads really did lead to Rome, which
was the cosmopolitan heart of the ancient Roman civilization. In
spite of passionate attempts by other Italian cities — Milan, Florence,
Venice, Naples — to steal her role, Rome remains the focus of Italian civi-
lization and culture. For thousands of years, artists have been coming to
Rome to study and work; visitors to see the grandiose monuments; and
pilgrims to visit the many Christian and Catholic holy places.
The artists and scholars who were drawn to Rome during the
Renaissance left their contribution in churches, buildings, and public
squares. The young aristocrats who came from all over Europe and the
United States in the 19th century flocked here to absorb the classical
world and admire Renaissance art in a rite of passage known as the
Grand Tour (the months-long European excursion enjoyed by the rich
and satirized by Mark Twain in The Innocents Abroad). Rome was maybe
the single most important stop then, and it remains so today.
Here we draw a quick picture of the most striking cultural features of
this historically and culturally rich city.
History 101: The Main Events
As legend has it, Rome was founded by Romulus, also known as Romolo,
one of two semigod twins (the other was Remus, or Remo) born to Mars
and the daughter of a local king, Rea Silvia. After narrowly escaping 
death — they were saved by a wolf who nursed them — the twins grew
up and set about establishing a new town. After a dispute, Romolo took
over and marked the borders on the ground. The date was April 21, 753
B.C. The city grew to be a beacon of civilization, absorbing and borrowing

any good features from other cultures it encountered (or conquered),
and creating a set of rules, principles, and laws that are still the bedrock
of modern Western values and institutions.
Rome started as a collection of shepherds’ huts, a small town populated
by the local Italic tribe. These people were descended from the Villanova
tribes, which had settled in the region of Rome around 1,000 B.C. on the
Palatino (Palatine Hill). The town was deeply influenced by the Etruscans,
a people famed for their seafaring, gold and metal work, and trading. The
Etruscans probably came from Asia Minor, but they established them-
selves in Tuscany and then expanded southward. They gave Rome its
name, drained the swamps, built sewers, and introduced writing. At that
time, Rome had kings, and the chasing out of the last king coincided with
the loss of the Etruscans’ influence. Weakened by their struggles with the
Greeks, who were colonizing southern Italy, the Etruscans lost their power
over Rome near the beginning of the fifth century B.C.
The Roman Republic was founded in 509 B.C., when the last of Rome’s
kings was overthrown. The republic was headed by two consuls and the
senate, all controlled by the upper or patrician (aristocratic) class. The
plebeians (the working class) later had their own council and were rep-
resented by tribunes. It took hundreds of years for Rome to gain control
over the Italian peninsula; in the meantime, it suffered many reverses,
including the destruction of the city by the Gauls in 390 B.C.
Gradually, Rome established military supremacy. The Romans have been
called the “Prussians of the ancient world,” for their militarism. They
first showed their might in decades of bloody war against the city of
Carthage, whose empire spread across North Africa and into Spain.
Known as the Punic Wars, these conflicts began in 264 B.C. It took the
Carthagian general Hannibal six months to make his famous march over
the Alps to attack the Romans from behind in 218 B.C., marking the start
of the Second Punic War. Hannibal’s army inflicted crushing defeats on
the Roman armies, but the Punic Wars eventually ended with the
Romans erasing Carthage from the map in 146 B.C. The door was then
open for Rome to spread its influence across the Mediterranean. It ruled
its provinces through governors and allowed subject countries to retain
local government and customs — though betrayal of Rome was brutally
avenged. The republic became fantastically rich, and Hellenic and
Eastern art, wealth, and cultural influences flowed into Rome. Recent
archaeological finds have shown a Roman presence as far away as the
borders of China.
The end of the Roman Republic and the beginning of the Roman Empire
arrived largely through the antagonism of two great generals, Pompey
and Julius Caesar. Caesar became a tyrant after his defeat of Pompey.
Following Caesar’s murder on March 15, 44 B.C. (the Ides of March), 
civil war ensued. The victor, Caesar’s grandnephew and adopted son,
Octavian, became the first emperor, Caesar Augustus. His reign turned
Rome into a glowing marble city the likes of which the world had never
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 15

seen, signaling the beginning of the two centuries of peace that allowed
the empire to reach its highest point. Not all was well in Rome, though,
and a string of mostly debauched and even insane rulers took power:
Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. Thanks to Robert Graves’s his-
torical novel I, Claudius (and the television miniseries based on the
book), Claudius is popularly considered a partial exception even though
his third wife, Nero’s mother, was also his niece, and he had 40 senators
put to death during his reign — by no means a model of enlightened
statesmanship. And then there was Nero, whose very name is a syn-
onym for cruelty: He had his own mother put to death in A.D. 59 and was
suspected of having ordered the terrible fires that destroyed large parts
of the city in A.D. 64.
Order returned in the second century, when Rome enjoyed a string of
“good” emperors who brought stable succession and civility — instead 
of madness and corruption — to the state. They were Nerva, Trajan,
Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and the emperor philosopher Marcus Aurelius.
With the ascension of Marcus’s 19-year-old son Commodus (the villain of
the hugely popular but fictionalized film Gladiator), the empire was again
headed for trouble. The corrupt and arrogant Commodus even had the
senate recognize him as divine. With his assassination in A.D. 192, the
empire plunged once more into chaos.
At its height, the empire extended from the Caspian Sea to Scotland.
However, a chaotic period of war, plague, barbarian invasions, and infla-
tion spelled the beginning of the bitter end for Rome. When Emperor
Constantine converted to Christianity and founded Constantinople in
A.D. 330, Rome’s wealth shifted east. The western empire began to crum-
ble under barbarian pressure: The Goths sacked Rome in A.D. 410; the
Huns came next under Attila; and the Vandals of North Africa followed.
In A.D. 476, the German chief Odoacer deposed the western Roman
emperor, in effect signaling the end of Roman rule over the city. The
once-invincible Roman Empire had lost much territory and shrunk to its
eastern part, where it continued to rule from Constantinople (until 1453,
when it fell to the Ottoman Empire).
Almost 80 years passed before Rome was reconquered by the
Byzantines of the Roman Oriental Empire at the end of a long and
destructive war against the Goths. The city had suffered terrible
destruction, and its population had dwindled from over 2 million at the
height of the Roman Empire to about 35,000. After the church’s right to
have a political state was recognized and the Vatican state was estab-
lished under the aegis of the Franks, Rome reverted to a small provincial
town. The French king Charlemagne had the pope crown him emperor
in A.D. 800, hoping to revive the western Roman Empire. He instead
ended up founding the Holy Roman Empire.
This historical oddity profoundly affected Roman politics during the
Middle Ages and Renaissance. The German emperor was elected by 
the German princes, but only the pope could crown him Holy Roman

Emperor. For the next 1,000 years, the pope became a key element in the
struggle for power among the Holy Roman Emperor (who was German),
Spain, and France (aspiring to the imperial crown). In spite of the trou-
bles that such a system brought to Rome — the city was under siege
between 1081 and 1084, before being won by the Normans — the papacy
grew stronger and richer, becoming a leading force in Italy. The popes,
usually from the leading families in Rome, attracted the best artists from
all over Italy and Europe to decorate the city’s ever-increasing number
of religious and secular buildings. They gave great influence to the artis-
tic side of the Renaissance — the rediscovery of classical learning and
culture — as they sought to make their city and its churches more and
more splendid, with works of art and architectural masterpieces.
But in many ways, Rome was very backward. Unfortunately, the popes
were not very interested in commerce, and they imposed a reactionary
and stultifying rule that killed the economy and stopped the city’s devel-
opment, making them quite unpopular. This state of affairs lasted for
hundreds of years. Rome was also caught up in international politics and
war, as well as in the struggle for power in Europe between the Germans
and the French. The German troops of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles
V sacked the holy city on May 6, 1527, one of Rome’s darkest days.
Peace was restored in 1529, and the popes kept control over the city
until the 19th century.
When the Risorgimento (resurgence) movement, which envisioned a
unified Italy, started developing, Rome was the designated capital for the
united country, and local patriots started working toward that aim. In
1848, when revolution swept Europe, Romans seemed to have a some-
what sympathetic ruler in Pius IX, who granted many concessions.
However, after a democratic republic was declared the following year,
Pius fled. He entreated France, Austria, Spain, and the Kingdom of
Naples to help him regain his temporal power. The Romans could not
defeat several great empires at once, and papal rule was restored.
In fact, Rome was the last piece of the Italian puzzle to fall to the nation-
alist movement, because the pope continued to receive help from the
French. In 1870, almost ten years after the unification of the rest of Italy,
Rome was finally wrested from papal–French control and made into the
capital of the Italian kingdom — the parliamentary monarchy of the
Savoy house — thus completing the unification.

1995
In preparation for the millennium celebrations and the Papal Jubilee, a great
campaign of restorations, reorganizations, and renovations begins.

After World War I, discontent and economic depression helped
Mussolini rise to power in Rome and in the rest of the country. One of
his first actions was to reach an agreement with the Vatican, the issue of
whose political role had continued to divide the people of Rome ever
since the unification of Italy in 1870. With the Lateran Pacts of 1929, the
pope agreed to a much-reduced state, and Rome relinquished the terri-
tory of the Vatican while recognizing the pope’s authority on church
ground. Mussolini’s imperialist adventures abroad were matched by
repression at home, and his alliance with the Nazis was disastrous.
Italians turned against him in 1943, and his puppet government was
overthrown. Under the king’s rule, Italy continued in World War II on
the Allied side while suffering under German occupation. Rome was
bombed repeatedly during the occupation and suffered much destruc-
tion. The Allies liberated the city on June 4, 1944, two days before D-day.
After the war, Rome voted against the monarchy and was established as
the capital of the new Italian republic. Economic recovery was slow, but
Rome emerged from the process as a thriving modern city and seat of
the Italian government on the one hand, and an ancient archaeological
site badly in need of preservation on the other. This contrast created
tension between modernization and preservation of the city’s unique
historical endowment that persists to this day. (Rome has been building
its subway system for over a century but still has only two lines because
of the innumerable archaeological treasures hidden underground.)
Traffic — a Roman problem since antiquity — continues to top the list of
local priorities, together with the management of the massive influx of
illegal immigrants and refugees that has been a factor since the 1990s.
Architecture: From Ruins to Rococo
Rome offers an almost complete compendium of architectural styles —
ancient Roman, Romanesque, medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque,
rococo, neoclassical, modern, and so on. Roman architecture was deeply
influenced by Greek culture, as can be seen in column-capital styles
around the city.
 The Doric style is most easily spotted in the simple rectilinear capi-
tals at the tops of columns.
 The Ionic capital resembles a scroll.
 The Corinthian is the most ornate capital, decorated with a profu-
sion of leaves.
The Colosseum demonstrates all three styles, or orders. Roman architects
added enormously to their Greek heritage with the invention of the arch
and the vault. The dome of the Pantheon is the apogee of such art, a
model that has been copied over the centuries, not least by Michelangelo
for the cupola in St. Peter’s Basilica.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
20

Of the country’s Christian-era churches, the earliest to be found are in
the Romanesque style, which, as its name suggests, drew inspiration
from Roman architecture and particularly the use of the rounded arch.
These churches have thick walls and massive piers that support the
superstructure of the building, as well as bell towers with arched open-
ings. The Romanesque style has an appealing simplicity (especially in
comparison with some gaudy later developments in church architec-
ture), which you can admire in many churches in Rome, including Santa
Maria in Trastevere.
With the Gothic style, lines become longer and arches pointed, giving 
a feeling of soaring toward the sky. Rome’s only card-carrying Gothic
church, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, is a less obvious version of the
style, much restored (and, alas, mutilated) over the centuries.
With the Renaissance style, ancient architecture is rediscovered, and
proportion and balance are stressed. The classical orders have a come-
back, with the Doric in the first story of the building, the Ionic in the
middle, and the Corinthian at the top. Michelangelo’s Palazzo Farnese
in Rome is a classic example of the Renaissance style.
Eventually, the Renaissance style evolved into the more elaborate
baroque. The sweeping colonnade in front of St. Peter’s, designed by
Bernini, is considered baroque. Rome went through a huge face-lift during
the baroque period, when popes and all the important families in the city
poured money into new palaces and churches and lavish decorations. If
baroque was an elaboration of the Renaissance style, rococo — the addi-
tion of all sorts of baubles and flourishes to the underlying structure —
was overkill. Perhaps the best word to describe rococo is busy. With its
twisting columns and encrusting of gold, Bernini’s baldacchino (bal-
dachin, or canopy) inside St. Peter’s shows the baroque starting to get 
out of hand.
A Taste of Rome: Eating Locally
As in the rest of Italy, meals (and restaurant menus) are divided among
primi (first courses), secondi (second courses), and contorni (side
dishes). The distinction is mostly a matter of presentation: In the U.S., 
all the components typically arrive together in one dish, while Italians
serve them one at a time. Proportions are also different, with meat or
fish representing a smaller part of the meal than in the U.S. Antipasti
(appetizers) are an option to open the meal — and allow time for prepa-
ration of the main courses — while dolci (sweets) or gelato (ice cream)
are alternatives to fruit or cheese to end the meal.
Roman cuisine is just one style of Italian cuisine, with a number of local
characteristics that make it unique. You’ll find many of the staples of
Italian food — all kinds of pasta, plenty of veggies, olive oil, fresh herbs —
but also a lot of specific and traditional ingredients and preparations that
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 21

you won’t find elsewhere in Italy. The leitmotif of Roman cuisine is simplic-
ity, with dishes based on few and fresh ingredients. Traditional Roman cui-
sine is based on pasta, fresh seasonal vegetables, seafood, and meat —
especially organ meat and smaller animals such as pork, chicken, rabbit,
lamb, and goat. Preparations are usually simple and flavorful, and a
number of “established” dishes remain great favorites with the locals.
Traditional Roman cuisine is always cooked with olive oil, not butter 
and cream — although, of course, you’ll find those in dishes from other
Italian regions (the north in particular). Parmesan cheese (the best
being Parmigiano Reggiano, the original from Reggio, which makes the
commercial stuff taste like sawdust) is widely used. You’ll find savory
Pecorino Romano grated on traditional pasta dishes; it is the local sheep
cheese from the Roman countryside and has a sharp, distinctive flavor.
Vegetarian dishes are common both as main dishes (pasta dishes and
secondi) and as side dishes and salads.
A little oddity in traditional restaurants and trattorie is that each day of
the week is traditionally associated with a few specialties. For example,
Thursday is the day for gnocchi, and Friday is the day for seppie coi
piselli and baccalà (see “Secondo,” later in this chapter). The underlying
reason is that many of these dishes require lengthy preparations, and
because in the best restaurants everything is strictly homemade, these
operations are performed only once a week. Be adventurous, and try the
local specialties when you can.
Antipasto
The tradition of antipasto is relatively recent and refers to the “munchies”
brought out to while away the time before the real meal is served. We
aren’t talking about a bowl of peanuts or potato chips, either. In everyday
meals at home, the appetizer is a pasta dish or risotto, but on special occa-
sions, a large spread precedes the primo. With current concern about
carbs, many will choose to have antipasto instead of a starchy primo.
Traditional Roman antipasti usually include a choice of the best local
cured meats — salami, ham, and sausages from the area around Rome —
and some of the best specialties from the rest of Italy, such as the incom-
parable prosciutto di Parma (air-cured ham) and lardo di Colonnata (a
cholesterol-free lard cured in marble vats). Other typical appetizers
include insalata di mare (sliced octopus seasoned with olive oil, vinegar,
and herbs), olives, and carciofini (pickled artichokes). In pizzeria restau-
rants, you may also be offered bruschetta (slices of toasted peasant-style
bread dressed with olive oil, garlic, and sometimes tomatoes), supplì
(egg-shaped balls of seasoned rice filled with cheese and deep fried),
olive Ascolane (large green olives filled with meat and cheese, battered
and deep fried), or fiori di zucca (zucchini flowers filled with cheese and
anchovy and deep fried).

22

Primo
This is the first course of a traditional meal, but nowadays, many will
make a meal out of it, maybe accompanied by a contorno (see descrip-
tion later in this section).
Pasta occupies an important place in Roman cuisine: you’ll find
spaghetti, penne, tagliatelle, and innumerable varieties of fresh and
stuffed pasta. The most traditional dishes are spaghetti con le vongole
(with clams, no tomato), bucatini or rigatoni all’amatriciana (a spicy
tomato sauce with lard and onions served with pecorino cheese), and
pasta all’arrabbiata (tomato and lots of hot red pepper). Another deli-
cious traditional pasta seasoning is gricia (lard, onions, and pecorino).
Among the fresh filled pasta, the best are ravioli filled with ricotta and
spinach, agnolotti (filled with meat), and cannelloni (large rolls of fresh
pasta filled with meat or fish, and baked with tomato sauce and cheese).
Tradition dictates that fresh filled pasta is usually reserved for special
days — Sunday and holidays — but it’s always on offer for the visitor.
Another kind of fresh pasta is potato gnocchi (dumplings, usually in a
tomato-based sauce), a beloved local specialty traditionally served on
Thursday.
Although less traditional, at least one kind of risotto, a typical dish of
somewhat sticky and very tasty seasoned Italian rice, appears on most
menus. In seafood restaurants, you’ll find risotto alla pescatora (with
fresh shellfish and a bit of tomato); in other restaurants, you’ll find sea-
sonal vegetable-based risotto — with artichokes, asparagus, or radic-
chio, among others. Soups include the traditional minestrone (a thick
vegetable and bean soup) and pasta e ceci (a thick savory soup of pasta
and chickpeas, usually served on Thursday).
Secondo
This is the second course of the meal and consists of meat or fish.
Tradition holds that Romans eat fish on Tuesday and Friday, meat on
other days. Vegetarian dishes are always acceptable. Although few
Romans still observe these traditions at home, they are more than
happy that Roman trattorie do, and you’ll find them gaily eating the 
traditional daily specials — so much so that if you arrive too late, the
specials will be gone.
Although most trattorie offer fish every day, Tuesday and Friday bring 
a greater variety of seafood dishes, especially traditional ones such as
seppie coi piselli (cuttlefish stewed with peas) and baccalà (salted cod
prepared in a stew with potatoes). Among the best traditional meat dishes
are the abbacchio arrosto (young lamb roasted with herbs), scottadito (lit-
erally “finger burning” — thin grilled lamb cutlets), and saltimbocca alla
romana (literally “jump in your mouth Roman style” — thin slices of veal
or beef rolled with ham and sage and sautéed with a bit of wine). For 
the more adventurous, there are trippa alla romana (tripe Roman style,
stewed with a light tomato sauce) and coda alla vaccinara (oxtail stew).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 23

Contorno and salad
When you order a secondo in a restaurant, it will come without a side
dish; you’ll have to order that separately. That’s convenient for vegetari-
ans, who always have a choice of fresh vegetables. Cooked greens are
very common; you’ll always find a choice of cicoria (dandelions),
spinach, or bieda (Swiss chard), prepared all’agro (seasoned with oil and
lemon juice) or ripassati (sautéed with garlic and hot pepper). Other tra-
ditional contorni are patate arrosto (roasted potatoes, deliciously pre-
pared with fresh herbs), patate fritte (french fries), and fagiolini (green
beans — but beware; they are well cooked and seasoned with olive oil
and lemon juice). January through March is the season for the unique
carciofi Romani (wonderful artichokes you can eat in their entirety — 
no spines, woody leaves, or barbs inside to contend with).
You’ll also always find salad, usually a simple affair of plain lettuce, but
sometimes more elaborate, with sliced carrots, fennel, and tomatoes. A
special salad that’s very common in the summer (lots of people with
their swimsuit size in mind order it as a main course) is the Caprese,
made of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil; sometimes it incorpo-
rates the famous mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella), imported
from nearby Campania. All these salads are served unseasoned, with
olive oil and vinegar or lemon on the side.
Last but not least is puntarelle, our favorite local fresh green. It’s a spe-
cialty in early spring in Rome. This salad is made from the hearts of the
cicoria plant, which are sliced and seasoned with garlic, anchovy, and
olive oil.
Dolci and dessert
At lunch, most working people end their meal with a piece of fresh fruit
or cheese (usually, local pecorino). Rome is not particularly famous for
its sweets, but that doesn’t mean your sweet tooth will go unsatisfied —
not by a long shot.
Among the most common desserts are creme caramel and the traditional
crostata (tart) in two main versions: crostata alla marmellata (tart with
homemade jam) and crostata della nonna (tart filled with pastry cream
and pine nuts). Other desserts include bignè alla crema (puff-pastry
balls filled with cream, covered with dark chocolate, and served with
whipped cream) and tiramisù (layers of mascarpone cheese and
espresso-soaked ladyfingers).
You’ll also always find ice cream (gelato), but it will rarely be homemade
in a restaurant, and you’re definitely better off waiting and having your
ice cream at a proper ice cream parlor. There, you’ll also find granita
(frozen coffee or lemon ice), which is very refreshing and low in calories
(unless you add real whipped cream to your coffee granita, which is deli-
cious). The main attraction, gelato, comes in a variety of fruit and cream
flavors (see Chapter 10); one of our favorites is zabaglione (a cream made
with sugar, egg yolks, and Marsala wine, similar in taste to eggnog).

Wine
The best-known Roman wines come from the nearby Castelli Romani
(hill towns east of the city; see Chapter 14). Among these, the white 
varieties — such as Frascati — are especially good, very dry, and treach-
erously refreshing. Other excellent wines come from the region of
Viterbo, near Tarquinia and the Lago di Vico (see Chapter 14), such as
the famous Est, Est, Est! and the dessert muscat wine Aleatico di Gradoli.
Word to the Wise: The Local Language
Italian is Rome’s primary language; if you know it a bit, or if your ear is
particularly good, you’ll notice that in Rome people speak differently
than in other parts of Italy. Roman is the local dialect, a very colorful
lingo that has given life to a rich heritage of poetry — Trilussa is the
most famous poet writing in the Roman dialect — and popular sayings,
often full of a witty philosophy, that are sometimes quite untranslatable.
The other language you can resort to is sign language. Actually, other
Italians make fun of Romans for using their hands so much. In Rome, your
hands talk — both to emphasize your words and to convey further mean-
ing. If you don’t speak any Italian, many Romans will go out of their way
to try to understand you and help you out, and signs will be of great help.
See the glossary of Italian words in Appendix B for some key words and
phrases. Also see Chapter 17, where we list what we deem are the ten
most useful Italian expressions to know before your trip. If you’re more
adventurous, devote some time to Italian For Dummies, by Francesca
Romana Onofri and Karen Antje Möller (Wiley), and become a pro.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 25
The etiquette of drinking
Don’t expect to order a martini before dinner in a local trattoria — in many restau-
rants, and more particularly in trattorie, osterie, and pizzerie, you are unlikely to find a
full bar, because drinking liquor before dinner is not very common. Indeed, an aperi-
tivo is always served with tidbits to eat, and in restaurants you won’t see a waiter bring
out wine before putting some food, or at least bread, on the table. More formal and
internationally oriented restaurants will have an “American bar,” Italian for full bar.
There you’ll be able to ask for a scotch and water and not be rewarded with a per-
plexed stare. Elsewhere, follow the “when in Rome” rule: Have an aperitivo at a bar,
follow with wine over dinner, and have a grappa (clear brandy) or amaro (60- to 80-
proof bitter drink, made with herbs) after your meal.

Background Check: Recommended 
Books and Movies
Rome has been the subject or the background of innumerable works, both
of fiction and nonfiction. We have excluded guidebooks from the sugges-
tions in this section — you’ll find those recommended in Appendix A.
Whether you want to bone up on history or be entertained by sights of
the Eternal City, here are a few surefire choices.
True stories
The following nonfiction favorites not only will expand your knowledge
of Rome, but also will be pure reading pleasure.
 Polybius was a Greek hostage in Rome for 16 years in the second
century B.C., during which he wrote his Histories (reprinted by
Regnery/Gateway as Polybius on Roman Imperialism and by
Penguin as The Rise of the Roman Empire) to explain “by what
means and under what kind of constitution, almost the whole
inhabited world was conquered and brought under the dominion of
the single city of Rome, and that, too, within a period of not quite
fifty-three years” (219–167 B.C.).
 The Roman historian Tacitus is one of our primary sources of infor-
mation — and lurid stories — about the early emperors, including
Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero. His Annals have been pub-
lished in the Penguin Classics series as The Annals of Imperial
Rome and reprinted many times since.
 If you read 25 pages a day, it’ll take you only about four months to
get through Edward Gibbon’s History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire (begun in 1776), a monument of English prose in
several volumes. (You can find a less monumental Penguin
abridged version in paperback.)
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was the first great modern literary
visitor to Italy, and his wonderful Italian Journey (1816) contains a
few great pages on Rome as it was at the time of his visit.
 Shortly following Goethe, Stendhal — the author of The Red and
the Black and The Charterhouse of Parma — visited Rome and fell
deeply in love with the city. You can read his impressions in Three
Italian Chronicles (1826–1829).
Art history
When you visit Rome, you will see art, and in particular Renaissance art,
everywhere you look. Here are a few books to help you brush up on the
subject of Roman art:
Part I: Introducing Rome 
26

 Italian Giorgio Vasari was a painter, architect, and (literally)
Renaissance man. His Lives of the Most Eminent Painters and
Sculptors (1550; expanded in 1568) has been criticized for inaccu-
racy but is full of interesting information about the great painters 
of the Renaissance. The Oxford edition (1998) is one of the many
abridgements in translation of this huge work.
 Benvenuto Cellini’s famous Autobiography (1728) presents a vivid
picture of Cellini’s time in Renaissance Florence and Rome.
 Karl Ludwig Gallwitz’s Handbook of Italian Renaissance Painters
(1999) gives you an at-a-glance guide to 1,200 Italian painters; it
also has some nice reproductions, brief essays on the major
schools of painting, and some weird charts that show who influ-
enced whom. You may want to peruse it before you go, if you’re
really into art — it’s softcover and not very thick, so you may even
want to bring it along.
Works of fiction
A good novel is often one of the best ways to acquaint yourself with a
place, allowing you to immerse yourself in its culture. Our choices
include excellent books on both modern and ancient Rome.
 Alberto Moravia, one of the great Italian writers of the 20th cen-
tury, wrote many novels and short stories but none as famous as
The Conformist (1951), a study of the Fascist personality. He also
wrote two novels about Rome and Romans: Roman Tales (1954) and
The Woman of Rome (1949).
 Robert Graves wrote two novels — I, Claudius (1934) and its
sequel, Claudius the God (1935) — about the best of Augustus’s
Claudian successors. Although they’re works of fiction, they’re a
highly entertaining way to learn about the glory and decadence of
Imperial Rome.
 Henry James’s great novel The Portrait of a Lady (1881) unveils the
heart of Rome as seen by a young American woman in the 19th cen-
tury. (See the next section for info about the movie.)
 Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz won the Nobel Prize in 1905
largely on the strength of his monumental Quo Vadis? (1896), set 
in Rome during the time of Nero and concerning the relationship
between a Christian woman and a Roman soldier.
 Carlo Emilio Gadda’s novel That Horrible Mess in Via Merulana
(1954) is a wonderful Italian thriller; it was also adapted on the
screen in Pietro Germi’s film The Facts of Murder (1959).
The moving image
Rome has been the subject or the setting of several hit films over the
years. Of course, Roman and Italian directors have used Rome as the
background for many of their masterpieces. Fellini created one of 
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Rome 27

the most famous Italian films of all time, La Dolce Vita (1960), and his
beloved Rome figures in many of his other movies, including The Nights
of Cabiria (1957), a touching story showing unusual views of the city.
Vittorio De Sica got his second Oscar with The Bicycle Thief (1948) and
kept going with Umberto D. (1952) and Yesterday Today and Tomorrow
(1963). Rossellini’s Open City (1945) is another masterpiece, as is
Pasolini’s Mamma Roma (1962). Bernardo Bertolucci gained fame with
The Conformist (1970), an adaptation of Moravia’s novel (see the preced-
ing section), and used Rome in some of his other great movies, such as
the psychological Luna (1979) and the dramatic Besieged (1998).
International directors have also loved the city, beginning with the many
movies that re-created the grandeur of Imperial Rome: William Wyler’s
Ben-Hur (1959); Mervyn LeRoy’s Quo Vadis (1951); Joseph L. Mankiewicz’s
Cleopatra (1963); Anthony Mann’s The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964);
and Spartacus (1960), the Oscar-winning Kirk Douglas movie about a slave
revolt in ancient Rome (Spartacus’s story actually took place in Capua). It
was a precursor to Ridley Scott’s Gladiator (2000), which also gives a vis-
ceral feel for the brutal side of the empire. Also treading the paths of
ancient Rome is Julie Taymor, in her Titus (1999), an adaptation of
Shakespeare’s Titus Andronicus.
Innumerable movies, both oldies and recent successes, have been set in
Rome. William Wyler’s Roman Holiday (1953), the Gregory Peck–Audrey
Hepburn romance, is said to have caused a surge in tourism. Jean
Negulesco’s Three Coins in the Fountain (1954) was a great hit, followed
by Vincent Minnelli’s Two Weeks in Another Town (1962) and Jean-Luc
Goddard’s Contempt (1963). More recently, Rome has appeared in cameos
in an increasing number of movies: from Peter Greenaway’s Belly of an
Architect (1987) to Michael Lehmann’s madcap art-theft caper Hudson
Hawk (1990). Rome even turns up in Gus Van Sant’s My Own Private 
Idaho (1991), as well as in Norman Jewison’s Only You (1996), Anthony
Minghella’s The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), and the final scene of Neil
Labute’s Nurse Betty (2000). Rome was used more extensively in Jane
Campion’s The Portrait of a Lady (1996), based on Henry James’s novel.

 Knowing the off season from the high season

 Scanning a calendar of the best festivals and events
R
ome has met the challenge of the new millennium: Longer open
hours, Web sites, information hotlines, cumulative tickets, air-
conditioning, shuttle services, and so on. More than ever, tourists are
welcome in the Eternal City, and the added benefit of the euro makes
things a lot easier for visitors used to dollars or pounds — no more
3,500-lire ice cream cones or shoes costing a cool quarter-million.
Rome, though, is also a metropolis, with cultural and logistic quirks that
can make your visit more or less pleasant, depending on when you go.
Here, we give you tips to plan what we hope will be your best trip ever.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
Rome has a warm, dry climate with well-defined seasons. Winters are
mild, and what Romans call “bitter cold,” is around 30°F (–4°C), which
rarely happens during the day. In summer, the weather is hot, maybe not
as humid as it gets in, say, Washington, D.C., but still rather unpleasant,
particularly if you’re sensitive to heat. Also, many attractions are out-
doors, where you can’t resort to air conditioning (which, by the way, more
times than not will not work as well in your hotel room as at home).
We really don’t recommend coming in August: It is crowded with tourists
and lines, and unbearably hot. All the locals have gone out of town,
including shop and restaurant owners who often take at least two weeks
off in August, if not the entire month. July isn’t much better temperature
wise, but at least most restaurants and shops are open.
Check the average temperatures in Table 3-1 before you plan your trip.
Most of the rain usually falls in the late fall and winter (it rarely snows 
in Rome — maybe once every ten years), with November usually being
rainiest. Heavy and brief thunderstorms are common, not only during

the fall and winter, but also in the spring and summer (particularly in
Aug), and the occasional rainy day — rarely more than two in a row —
can happen all year around but particularly from fall to spring.

The once well-defined high season for tourism has become somewhat
variable. As more and more people travel to Italy at all times, the off
season is shrinking. Currently, hotels in Rome consider high season mid-
March to June, September to mid-October, and December 24 to January
6. Low season is July and August, as well as January and February. The
rest of the year is shoulder season, during which the application of
higher rates depends on the hotel. As a general guideline, high season
starts earlier and lasts longer for smaller and cheaper hotels (which
tend to fill faster). The reverse is true for more expensive hotels.
Here are what we consider to be the pros and cons for traveling in each
season.
April through June
In our opinion, spring and early summer are the most pleasant time to
visit Rome:
 Temperatures are moderate, and the weather is mild, making it a
pleasure to walk through the city both during the day and at night.
 Limited rainfall allows you to get out and enjoy the outdoor 
activities — without worrying about excess heat and sunstroke.
But keep in mind:
 Everybody knows this is a great season — including hotels and air-
lines, which jack up their prices. Make your reservations as early 
as possible, particularly for small, highly desirable hotels.
 Around Easter time, vast numbers of Catholic pilgrims and large
groups of very noisy schoolchildren from all around the world
descend on Rome. Plan your museum visits carefully, and definitely
make reservations.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
30

 May 1 is Labor Day in Italy, and all workers in Rome have the day
off, including waiters, shopkeepers, and bus drivers. Everything
shuts down, even public transportation.
July and August
Summertime is when most people take their vacations, and there are
many upsides:
 The weather is beautiful, and outdoor life — especially in the sweet
evenings — is at its max.
 You can get discount rates in most hotels.
 There is little traffic because residents tend to escape to the
seashore, especially on weekends.
On the other hand, it may also be the worst time to come to Rome:
 Airfares are high.
 You can expect long lines for major attractions, because many
tourists visit.
 The heat can make things quite uncomfortable — temperatures
during the day often soar into the 90s, and Roman ruins turn into
ovens (also, Rome is still mostly non-air-conditioned).
 Many shops and restaurants close during August, most definitely
on August 15, the Italian holiday of Ferragosto.
September and October
Next to spring, fall is our favorite time to travel to Italy:
 The weather is still fairly mild and pleasant.
 With school back in session, crowds are relatively sparse.
On the other hand:
 Hotel prices are high.
 You have to watch for the rain, which typically starts falling in
October.
November through March
More and more vacationers are reaping the benefits of traveling to Italy
in the winter; if you can put up with rain and occasional cold spells, this
is an excellent time for traveling to Rome:
 The relatively mild weather keeps the city pleasant for touring.
Rain is at its heaviest in November and December but is usually
manageable, with brief heavy rainfall followed by periods of calm.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 31

 You can enjoy your visit more, because there are fewer crowds at
the prime attractions, and you often receive better and more atten-
tive service.
 Except for the Christmas–New Year’s period, airfares and hotel
rates are at their lowest.
 On a rainy day in November, we once found the Pantheon almost
empty.
But keep in mind:
 Although average temperatures are mild, and cold spells tend to be
short, it can get quite chilly. Depending on how resistant you are to
colder temperatures, you may not be able to enjoy some of the out-
door attractions.
 Traffic is at its worst because most people take their cars to go to
work and shopping when it gets nippy; correspondingly, air- and
noise-pollution levels rise.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Rome has many events worth planning a holiday around. Alternatively,
you can use the following calendar to avoid big events and their atten-
dant crowds.
Most Christian holidays — not just Christmas and Easter, but also saints’
days and Tutti Santi (All Saints’ Day, Nov 1) — are marked by some
kind of celebration and often by processions and special foods.
January
Celebrate the new year with your children in Piazza del Popolo, and
watch the clowns, acrobats, papier-mâché masks, and other fun attrac-
tions. Contact the tourist info line for a schedule of events at % 06-
36004399. January 1.
The religious holiday Epifania (Feast of the Epiphany) takes a secular
turn in Rome, and children receive special gifts — more than on
Christmas. The open-air fair in Piazza Navona, selling toys and gifts,
stays open until the wee hours of the morning. January 6.
February
In Rome, as everywhere else in Italy, Carnevale swallows up the week
before Ash Wednesday, culminating on Fat Tuesday or Martedi Grasso.
During this former pagan rite of the coming of spring, people — espe-
cially children — dress up in costumes and participate in masked par-
ties. Everyone celebrates Carnevale, at least by eating frappe (thin slices
Part I: Introducing Rome 
32

of crunchy fried dough with powdered sugar) and castagnole (deep-fried
balls of dough, often filled with custard). In Rome, you can find concerts
and organized events, as well as lots of people parading around the city
(particularly along Via Veneto) in costume on Fat Tuesday evening. Call
the tourist office at % 06-4889991 or check www.comune.roma.it for
details. Tuesday before Ash Wednesday.
March and April
Every year, more than 40 directors from over 25 countries participate 
in RIFF, the Roma Independent Film Festival (% 06-45425050; www.
riff.it). One week in March or April.
Rome’s Marathon (www.maratonadiroma.it) takes place along a
scenic route passing by the Colosseum. Though not as famous as its
New York counterpart, it is nonetheless a high-profile competition
among international athletes and a wonderful event. Around March 20.
On Venerdì Santo (Good Friday), the Catholic rite of the procession 
of the Stations of the Cross (Via Crucis) is presented in most Roman
churches, sometimes as a reenactment with costumes. The Vatican’s
procession takes place at night, led by the pope, between the Colosseum
and Palatine Hill. Friday before Easter Sunday.
The pope gives his traditional Benedizione Pasquale (Easter
Benediction) in Piazza San Pietro. Easter Sunday, between the end 
of March and mid-April.
During the Mostra delle Azalee (Exhibition of Azaleas), more than 700
azalea plants are exhibited on the Spanish Steps to celebrate the begin-
ning of spring. Concerts take place in Trinità dei Monti at the head of the
steps. Call % 06-4889991 for more information. Mid-April through July,
weather permitting.
Tradition has it that Romulus founded Rome — by tracing its original
limits on the ground — on April 21 in the year 753 B.C. The day, Rome’s
Birthday (Natale di Roma), is still warmly celebrated in Rome with a
series of cultural events. Contact the tourist info line at % 06-36004399
for more information. April 21.
Via Margutta turns into an open-air gallery for the Cento Pittori Via
Margutta (see November listing). Five days in April/May.
May
For Labor Day (Festa del Lavoro), everything shuts down except in
Piazza San Giovanni, where the holiday is celebrated with a great pop-
music festival (check the tourist info line for a program of events at 
% 06-36004399). May 1.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 33

Rome’s Concorso Ippico Internazionale di Roma (International Horse
Show) attracts the best riders and mounts from all over the world to
Villa Borghese’s beautiful Piazza di Siena. You can buy tickets at the gate.
For details, contact the Piazza di Siena ticket agent at % 06-6383818 or
visit www.piazzadisiena.com. Late May.
June and July
The Estate Romana (Roman Summer) is a multifarious festival with an
extremely rich program of concerts, theater, special exhibits, and shows
for every audience, featuring a huge number of events from sport to art
and culture throughout Rome. Performances held inside Roman ruins
are particularly dramatic. See Chapters 15 and 16 for details (% 06-
4889991 or www.estateromana.comune.roma.it for a schedule of
events) Mid-June through early September.
One offshoot of the Estate Romana festival is the Villa Celimontana
Jazz (Via della Navicella; % 06-77208423; www.villacelimontana
jazz.com), which mounts jazz concerts by international and national
musicians in the picturesque setting of the Villa Celimontana park. June
through August.
Another is Gay Village (% 340-5423008; www.gayvillage.it), a small
town of tolerance and culture, where gay and straight people mingle to
enjoy dining, music, and a variety of artistic performances for all age
groups. Late June to early September.
August
The pagan holiday of Ferragosto — and the religious holy day of the
Assumption — celebrates the culmination of the summer. Romans vaca-
tion on the seashore and in the mountains. Most businesses are closed,
so call ahead to make sure your destination is open. August 15.
September
La Notte Bianca — White Night, in English — is a magic night of enter-
tainment, cultural events, and shows scheduled throughout the city and
throughout the night. The first edition was in 2003, and the event has
grown ever since. Check the Web site (www.lanottebianca.it) for a
calendar of events in English. First or second Saturday in September.
The Romaeuropa Festival (% 800-795525; www2.romaeuropa.net) is a
cultural extravaganza, presenting the best innovative and experimental
European dance, music, and theater performances. It celebrated its 20th
season in 2005, and its success continues unabated. End of September to
end of November.
Part I: Introducing Rome 
34

October
The Festa di San Francesco d’Assisi (Feast of St. Francis of Assisi), a
celebration for the patron saint of Italy, is observed with processions,
special masses, and other religious events. October 4.
With concerts scheduled in all of Rome’s basilicas, the International
Festival of Sacred Music and Art (% 06-6869187; Fax 06-6873300;
www.festivalmusicaeartesacra.net) was born in 2002 and offers a
unique opportunity to all lovers of classical and sacred music. Second
week in October.
November
One hundred artists are selected for the Cento Pittori Via Margutta
exhibit (www.centopittoriviamargutta.it), which turns scenic Via
Margutta into an open-air gallery twice a year (another edition takes
place in April/May). Five days in November.
Over 30 years down the road, the Rome Jazz Festival (www.romajazz
festival.it) continues to attract the big Italian and international
names. Concerts take place in various venues throughout Rome
(another edition falls during the Estate Romana festival in June and 
July; see listing earlier in this calendar). Ten days in November.
December
For the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Roman firefighters deco-
rate the statue of the Madonna on the column of Piazza Trinità dei
Monti, at the top of the Spanish Steps, with flowers. Believers and the
pope himself visit the statue throughout the day to offer flowers to the
Virgin. December 8.
For Rome’s Crèche Exhibit, more than 50 nativity scenes are displayed
in the Villa Giulia, and many others are on view in churches around 
the city. Particularly nice are the ones in the Basilica di Santa Maria
Maggiore, Santa Maria d’Aracoeli (see Chapter 11), Santa Maria del
Popolo (Piazza del Popolo 12; % 06-3610487), and Chiesa del Gesù
(Piazza del Gesù, off Via del Plebiscito; % 06-6795131). Don’t miss the
life-size nativity scene in front of St. Peter’s, either. Three weeks leading
up to Christmas.
Piazza Navona becomes the seat of the Mercatino di Natale (Christmas
Market), with toys and candy sellers. The market starts three weeks
before Christmas and stays open all night on its last day, January 5, the
eve of Epiphany. Beginning of December through January 6 at dawn.
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 35

If you don’t mind crowds or getting up early, you can witness the pope
giving a special Christmas Blessing to Rome and the world from St.
Peter’s Square at noon on Christmas Day. For a chance of being in the
square, you should get there by 9 a.m. December 25.
Romans love New Year’s Eve, and partying reaches its climax at mid-
night, when the city explodes with fireworks. The Vatican puts on its
own fiery show, and there’s an organized concert–cum–fireworks show
in Piazza del Popolo, but everybody gets into the act, shooting fireworks
from every window and roof. By tradition, fireworks are accompanied by
the symbolic throwing away of something old to mark the end of the old
year. Although the tradition has been outlawed, some people still get
carried away, so watch out for falling UFOs if you take a stroll shortly
after midnight! December 31.

t’s time to delve into the nitty-gritty of trip planning: all
those details that are necessary to make your vacation as
perfect as possible. We give you some tips on budgeting —
how to save a few euro here and there — and tell you what to
expect in terms of banks and currency exchange. We also lay
out the different ways you can get to Rome, including various
travel packages, and offer suggestions on buying travel insur-
ance, staying healthy, and staying in contact with those who
didn’t get to make the trip. And, so everyone has a good time,
we also offer advice to those people who have special travel
needs or interests — travelers with disabilities, families, sen-
iors, and gays and lesbians.

W
hen it comes to planning a vacation budget, you usually deal with
two different numbers: what you’d like to spend and what you
can spend. In this chapter, we give you some pointers to help you decide
where to trim the incidentals and splurge on the things that really
matter to you, so that you can design a terrific vacation without break-
ing the bank.
Planning Your Budget
Rome’s level of services has increased to match the highest international
standards. Unfortunately, prices have followed suit, and the cost of living
has more than doubled since the introduction in 2002 of the euro, the unit
of currency that replaced the old lire. You get more in hotels and restau-
rant, but you pay more as well. On the good side, many public services,
including state museums and attractions, have maintained — or even
reduced — their prices, while offering a lot more than before. We figure
there are six major elements that eat up your vacation budget: transporta-
tion, lodging, dining, sightseeing, shopping, and nightlife. Knowledge is
key, and we want to share with you our hard-earned experience with each
of these. With the euro flying higher against the dollar, how well you plan
certain elements can make or break your budget.
The following sections provide more tips and consideration that emerge
as you plan your budget. Table 4-1 gives you a sampling of costs that
you may encounter on your trip. Oh, yes, and don’t forget taxes — under
some circumstances, you may be eligible for a refund (see Chapter 12).

Transportation
Airfare is one of the biggest components of your budget. Keeping it low
gives you a sort of cushion for the rest of your expenses. The actual cost
depends on when you travel, but booking in advance helps, too — the
cheaper seats are the first to go. If you wait until mid-June to reserve a
flight to Rome for July, you’ll be lucky to pay $1,200, if you can find a
seat at all. Book ahead, and you may save $300 or $400; that’s money
you can put toward a shopping splurge or a more comfortable hotel.
Wait for the off-season, and you may find tickets for half that much or
even less. Make sure that you check out our money-saving tips before
buying an airline ticket (see Chapter 5).
Getting around Rome after you’re there is inexpensive — for example, a
three-day public transportation pass is only 11€ ($14). Out-of-town trips
are cheap, too, if you use public transportation. You have to budget
more if you’re planning to take a tour, hire a limousine, or rent a car — 
a rather expensive proposition in Rome.
Keep in mind that in Rome you absolutely don’t need a car, and if you
arrive there with one, you have to keep it garaged during your entire
stay — and pay for that. Rome has too many roads and drivers for you
to want to deal with, plus it bans nonresidents from driving in il centro
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
40

(the historic center), which is the part of the city where most attractions
lie. Also, organized thieves steal cars and from cars, and you don’t want
the risk. If you feel you need a car for a day trip, rent one for the occa-
sion, by all means, but expect to pay a minimum of 70€ ($91) per day for
an economy car and about $7 per gallon for gas.
Lodging
Lodging is another big-ticket item. Accommodations are so expensive in
Rome that the price of a medium-range hotel elsewhere covers only a
budget hotel or a hostel here. Even in the off-season, you won’t be able
to spend much less than around $150 a night, and that is if you’re willing
to forgo amenities and put up with a certain amount of inconvenience
(less central location, tiny room, and so on). In the high season, you
should plan on spending at least $200 to have minimum comfort (see
Chapter 9 for a lowdown on what to expect from your hotel room in
Rome). Of course cheaper options exist, and you can save a lot of money
if you don’t mind smaller private facilities and a simpler room. But there,
too, it all depends on how much you want to compromise. You don’t
want to make it so difficult for yourself that it will spoil your entire vaca-
tion. Here again, booking in advance will let you get the best deals. As an
added advantage, if you book all your hotels in advance, you’ll know
that piece of the budget before you leave.
Prices also vary depending on which area of Rome you choose. Figure
that 150€ ($195) pays for a decent double room with a private bathroom
somewhere in Rome, but 230€ ($299) gets you a nice room in the his-
toric center. From 350€ ($455) and up, you’re in the luxury range, proba-
bly close to the most famous attractions. Of course, the amounts that
these estimates represent in dollars constantly vary, according to cur-
rent exchange rates.
You can save money if you skip the breakfast your hotel serves, unless
it’s included with your room rate (which we indicate in our reviews in
Chapter 9). Breakfast is worth paying for only at the more expensive
hotels ($$$ and above), where you find a buffet with a variety of foods,
usually including eggs, sausage, cheese, cold cuts, yogurt, fruit, and
cereal. This kind of breakfast may run about 20€ ($26), so you have to
decide if what you get is worth the money.
In all the hotel reviews in this guide, we supply the rack rate, which, in
Rome, is the highest rate the hotel will charge you (at the peak of high
season and when the hotel is completely full). You should be able to do
better than that in most cases. See Chapter 9 for a table indicating what
the $ symbols ($–$$$$$) mean.
Dining
Your expenses will vary with your style: What you spend will depend 
on what and how you eat. Possibilities in Rome are endless and, on the
whole, very satisfactory: You’ll find cheap eateries, gourmet haunts, and
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 41

everything in between, all serving excellent food. You also have the
option of buying your own food (for snacks and picnics, for example)
and the choice is always large, ranging from small vendors to open-air
markets to supermarkets. Prices depend on the elegance or trendiness
of the place you choose and on the food you order. Drinks excluded,
expect to spend about 40€ ($52) per person for a full dinner in Rome in
a middle-range restaurant, and 25€ ($33) in a less formal one, such as a
pizzeria or osteria. For a truly special meal in one of the top restaurants,
expect to spend an average of 65€ ($85) per person for a meat dinner
and as much as 85€ ($111) for a fish meal. Prices for food on the go are
much lower: you can spend as little as 5€ to 8€ ($6–$9.60) in a rosticce-
ria or pizza a taglio place. In most restaurants, prices are not signifi-
cantly different at lunch or dinner, but some restaurants serve more
elaborate dishes — with accordingly higher prices — only at dinner, 
or offer a lunch prix-fixe, which is a deal.
In the listings in Chapter 9 we give you the price range of secondi; these
meat or fish dishes are the most expensive on the menu. Side dishes 
are priced separately, and you may be content with just a primo (a less
expensive pasta dish; see Chapter 2 for more on the structure of a meal
in Italy). Most restaurants impose a basic table-and-bread charge, called
pane e coperto, of about 2€ to 4€ ($2.60–$5.20). Tipping isn’t a big extra
in Rome, because prices usually include service, and you need only leave
a small token of appreciation. Check for the words servizio incluso (serv-
ice included) on the menu; if they aren’t there, expect to pay a full gratu-
ity of 15 percent. Just as with the hotels, we use a dollar-sign system to
designate the prices of restaurants; these refer to a complete meal. See
Chapter 10 for a table indicating what the $ symbols ($–$$$$) mean.
Sightseeing
Museums and other attractions charge anywhere from 2€ to 12€
($2.60–$16) for admission. Most churches are free (avoid visiting during
mass unless you’re attending the service, however). Frankly, sightseeing
isn’t an area where you can save a lot of money, and you’ll probably be
sorry if you try. On the other hand, entrance fees for most attractions
aren’t that expensive (with some notable exceptions), so your budget
won’t be stretched to its limits by daily sightseeing expenditures.
In Chapter 11, we describe special combination discount tickets and
cards, which can represent a great savings.
Age-based discounts are available based on reciprocity between coun-
tries. Therefore, senior and children discounts aren’t available to
Americans but are available to British visitors and other residents of
European Union (EU) countries.
You can calculate a large percentage of this item of your budget before
leaving if you make advance reservations; they are offered for most
museums and attractions (see Chapter 11).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
42

Shopping
Shopping is the one expenditure that is totally within your control: You
can shop ’til you drop, spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars,
or you can limit yourself to window shopping. In Chapter 12, we give you
our recommendations for the best shops and items each neighborhood
offers. Rome is famous for its artwork, design, and crafts — antique prints,
handmade paper, plaster works, pottery, leather, gold, and lace, among
many other fine wares. And the city isn’t half bad for Italian fashion —
besides the local designers, Valentino, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, and
Armani are a few of the world-famous Italian firms located in Rome.
Depending on exchange rates, you may actually save by buying Italian
goods in Rome. More important, though, being in Rome gives you a
chance to buy things that simply aren’t available back home. Use your
trip as a chance to pick up that special something you have an irre-
sistible craving for — maybe a print of the Pantheon, a handmade
golden necklace, a Gucci handbag, or even a nice used Ferrari (just kid-
ding). Remember to plan in your budget enough shopping money for the
kind of goods you think you may want to buy, and remember also that
you can get back the value-added tax (known in Italy as IVA) for large
purchases (see Chapter 12).
Nightlife
Visiting the opera, going out for a drink, listening to music in a jazz club,
and dancing the night away can make your time in Rome that much more
memorable. You can spend big bucks in this department, or you can cut
costs by enjoying those serendipitous little things that are free or nearly
so, such as people-watching on a beautiful floodlit piazza or ordering a
coffee or drink in a classic caffè and soaking in the atmosphere.
Ticket prices for performances can vary a good deal, from 10€ ($13) for
a concert at a small venue to 130€ ($169) for the best seat at the opera.
Nightclubs in Rome are about as expensive as those anywhere else, but
you may be able to avoid a cover charge by sitting or standing at the bar
rather than taking a table, or by arriving before a certain hour. If you
happen to be in Rome during a public holiday or festival, you may enjoy
abundant free entertainment, much of it in the streets.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43
Don’t sit to sip
Be aware that any time you sit down in a caffè or bar in Italy, things cost more. Coffee
at an outside table in Piazza del Popolo or Piazza Navona, for example, may cost the
same as lunch elsewhere. Most Italians stand at the bar while they have a coffee or
a beer.

Cutting Costs — but Not the Fun
Don’t feel like taking out a second mortgage on your house so you 
can afford a vacation to Rome? Well, you know the saying: “When in
Rome. . . .” Start thinking like a Roman. Romans have relatively less 
disposable income than Americans; the more closely you mirror the 
way they live and move about town, the cheaper your trip will be — and
the closer you’ll get to the Romans themselves. Staying in a huge hotel
designed for foreign tourists with all the fixings will cost you a lot, as will
the luxury of renting a big car. Tack on a few five-star-restaurant experi-
ences, and your budget flies out the window.
Instead, try to live for a week without your own private bathroom. Make
big, healthy sandwiches from the delicious stuff you buy in a market.
Pass on the postcards, trinkets, and other things that you pick up just 
to say that you’ve been to Rome — you may even save enough for a
splurge here and there.
But remember that sometimes, paying more makes sense. For example,
if you’re facing sightseeing overload and are dead tired, you may not
want to endure an hour-long bus ride to your hotel on the other side of
town. Take a cab instead. And why not grab a bite to eat in the more
expensive cafe near your hotel rather than deal with crossing town to 
an extra-cheap restaurant? Also watch out for areas where you simply
shouldn’t make cuts: Not seeing the Vatican Museums and Sistine
Chapel, the Colosseum, the Borghese Gallery, or some other major
attraction just because of the cost would be a tragedy. We’d rather skip
lunch and take the opportunity to go to one of these must-sees twice.
Who knows when you’ll be back this way again?
Throughout this book, we use the Bargain Alert icon to identify money-
saving tips and great deals. Here are some additional cost-cutting 
strategies.
 Go off season. If you can travel at nonpeak times (Nov–Mar, with
the exception of the Christmas–New Year’s holidays), you can find
airfares and hotel prices as much as 30 percent less than during
peak months.
 Travel on off-peak days of the week. Airfares vary depending 
not only on the time of the year but also on the day of the week.
International flights tend to be cheaper midweek. When you inquire
about airfares, ask whether you can obtain a cheaper rate by flying
on a different day. (See Chapter 5 for more tips on getting a good
fare.)
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations such as Rome, you
can book airfare, hotel, ground transportation, and even some
sightseeing by making just one call to a travel agent or packager,
and you may pay a lot less than if you tried to put the trip together
yourself. But always work out the prices that you’d pay otherwise,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
44

just to double-check. See the section on package tours in Chapter 5
for specific suggestions.
 Pack light. Packing light enables you to carry your own bags and
not worry about finding a porter (don’t forget to tip yourself).
Likewise, if you’re carrying only one or two bags, you can take a
bus or a train rather than a cab from the airport, saving yourself
quite a few more euro.
 Reserve a room with a refrigerator and coffeemaker. You don’t
have to slave over a hot stove to cut a few costs; most hotels have
minifridges, and some have coffeemakers. Buying supplies for
breakfast will save you money — and probably calories.
 Book a hotel in a less glamorous location. In Rome, you’ll find that
the edge of the historic center is just as convenient as a more cen-
tral location and may offer great bargains. You may need to do only
a little more walking or deal with a short commute. Don’t overdo it,
though: If you pick a hotel too far out of the way, you’ll waste hours
of precious time in transportation, and you may well ruin your trip.
The key is always to stay only a short distance from the attractions
you want to visit. See Chapter 9 for more hotel information.
 Have a picnic. You can put together some delicious and inexpen-
sive meals at a Roman grocery store, and then enjoy your feast in a
garden or park.
 Use public transportation. In Rome, using the local bus system
may be a little complicated at times, but it’s also a great way to see
the city the way locals do.
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save you money in
taxis and other transportation expenses. As a bonus, you’ll get to
know your destination more intimately as you explore at a slower
pace. Rome’s historic center is quite large, but you’ll want to visit it
in sections, so that you can actually walk almost anywhere you
need to go for that part of the day.
 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories can be
the best mementos of your trip. If you’re concerned about money,
you can do without the T-shirts, key chains, salt and pepper shak-
ers, and other trinkets.
Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. Consider, though, that
the only type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away
from home is your personal checkbook.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45

Making sense of the euro
Italy’s currency, the euro (the plural is also euro, and it’s abbreviated as
€ in this guide), was introduced in 2002 in Italy and in 11 other European
countries. You can use the same currency in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain.
The transformation to the euro has made things much easier for
Americans because 1€ exchanges in a range nearer $1 (the exchange
rate used in this book is 1€ = $1.30; we round off all dollar values above
$10). Many Web sites present the latest exchange rates; our favorite is
www.xe.com, where you can get up-to-date (and historical) comparisons
between the euro and your currency, whether it is the U.S. or Canadian
dollar, the British pound, or something else. At press time, the British
pound exchanged at £1 = 1.51€. These were the rates of exchange used
to calculate the values in Table 4-2.

Note that in the word euro, Italians pronounce all three vowels, so it’s ay-
ou-roh, not yurr-oh.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
46

From the U.S. standpoint, since the introduction of the euro, Italian prices
have increased, and quite a lot. This is due to the loss of value suffered
by the U.S. dollar on international currency markets. For instance, at
press time, the dollar buys fewer euro than it could two years ago. By the
time you read this, the two currencies may be closer to parity — but then
again, maybe not. It’s all the more important, then, to plan ahead and get
the best deals you can.
You can exchange money at the airport in Rome, where you’ll also find
automated teller machines (ATMs), as well as at banks and exchange
bureaus in town. These usually display multilingual signs (CHANGE/CAMBIO/
WECHSEL). Rates may vary to some degree. For example, some bureaus
advertise “no fee” but then give you a lower rate. Arriving in Rome with
a small supply of euro, at least enough to pay for a cab to your hotel, is 
a good idea in case the ATMs at the airport don’t work or the lines are
unbearably long.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM.
Look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then
call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. The Cirrus net-
work (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com) is the most common inter-
national network in Rome. PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) is less
common. The Banca Nationale del Lavoro (BNL) is one bank that does
offer PLUS in its ATMs; another sure bet is the Italian Post Offices’ ATMs.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47
The euro look
Paper bills come in 5€, 10€, 20€, 50€, 100€, 200€, and 500€ denominations. All bills
are brightly colored and in a different shade for each denomination. In addition, the
higher the value of the bill, the larger the size of the bill. A 50€ bill is bigger than a
dollar bill, and even the smaller denominations are taller than U.S. dollars; if you have
a bunch, you’ll find stuffing them in your wallet a bit difficult. Remember that shops
are always short of change, and breaking those large bills to buy a soft drink is some-
times difficult. Think ahead, and try to have a supply of 10€ bills with you.
Coins come in 1€ and 2€ (both thin and brass-colored); 10-cent, 20-cent, and 50-cent
(all brass colored); and 1-cent, 2-cent, and 5-cent (all copper-colored) denominations.
For more information and pictures of the currency, check the Web site of the European
Union (http://europa.eu.int/euro) or the European Central Bank (www.
ecb.int).
Don’t be surprised to see different country names on euro bills and coins: One face is
the European side, common to each of the 15 participating countries, and the reverse
is the national side, where each country prints its own design. All are valid and
accepted in each of the countries.

Before leaving for Rome, make sure that you check the daily withdrawal
limit for your ATM card, and ask whether you need a new personal iden-
tification number (PIN). You need a four-digit PIN for Europe, so if you
currently have a six-digit PIN, you must get a new one before you go.
Also, if your PIN is a word, make sure you know how it translates into
numbers, because some ATM keypads in Italy display only numbers.
Many banks impose a fee every time your card is used at a different
bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher for international transactions (up
to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where they’re rarely more than
$3). On top of this, the bank from which you withdraw cash may charge
its own fee. For international withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
In Rome, ATMs are never far away, so you can walk around with 100€
($130) in your wallet, and you should be set to dine and pay your
museum admissions (but not your hotel bill). Before going off on a driv-
ing tour of the countryside, however, make sure that you have a good
stock of cash in your wallet; banks and ATMs are rarer outside big cities,
and lots of small businesses don’t accept credit cards.
If you have linked checking and savings accounts and you’re in the habit
of moving relatively small amounts of money from savings to checking
as you need it, beware: Italian ATMs won’t show you the transfer-
between-accounts option, and they won’t allow you to withdraw money
directly from your savings account. If your checking account runs dry,
you must call or write your bank to move money from savings to check-
ing. (We did so, and our bank charged us $30. Ouch!)
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also make cash advances against your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, as long as you know your PIN. If you’ve forgot-
ten yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back
of your credit card, and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes
five to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee charged by Visa,
MasterCard, or American Express for currency conversion on credit
charges. But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
factor in such things as exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
upcoming trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when the
card is used numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
48

can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because 24-hour ATMs
allow you to withdraw small amounts of cash as needed. However, keep
in mind that you’ll likely be charged an ATM withdrawal fee if the bank 
is not your own (in Rome, it won’t be), so if you’re withdrawing money
every day, you may be better off with traveler’s checks — as long as 
you don’t mind showing identification every time you want to cash one.
Traveler’s checks are widely accepted in Rome, especially at large
tourist stores and at hotels.
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American Express
offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardholders only)
$1,000. You’ll pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent.
You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the phone by
calling % 800-221-7282; AMEX gold and platinum cardholders who use
this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide and at sev-
eral other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent and 
2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and
$1,000. Call % 800-732-1322 for information. AAA members can obtain
Visa checks without a fee at most AAA offices or by calling % 866-339-
3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s checks. Call % 800-223-9920 for
a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks, in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Being on vacation is a blissful time of distraction and discovery.
Unfortunately, that makes tourists ripe targets for pickpockets. In Italy,
violent crime is rare; most wallets that are stolen are lost to pickpockets,
not muggers.
If you discover that your wallet has been lost or stolen, contact all of
your credit card companies right away. You’ll also want to file a report at
the nearest police precinct. Your credit card company or insurer may
require a police-report number or record of the loss. Most credit card
companies have emergency toll-free numbers to call if your card is lost
or stolen; they may be able to wire you a cash advance immediately or
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49

deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the following
emergency numbers:
 American Express (% 06-72282 or 06-72900347 in Rome; 1-336-
393-1111 collect in the United States; www.americanexpress.com)
 Diners Club (% 800-864064 toll-free within Italy; www.diners
club.com)
 MasterCard (% 800-870866 toll-free within Italy; www.mastercard.
com)
 Visa (% 800-819014 toll-free within Italy; www.visaeurope.com).
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when banks and American
Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you through
Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license or passport along with your
cash and credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immedi-
ately; placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against lia-
bility for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies
are Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289;
www.transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call
your airline and explain the situation; it may allow you to board the
plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy
of the police report you’ve filed.
Watch your purse, wallet, briefcase, or backpack in any public place.
And when walking on the streets, keep your purse on the side away from
traffic, so a thief on a motor scooter can’t speed by and grab it from you.
Better yet, carry your money, credit cards, and passport in an interior
pocket, where pickpockets won’t be able to snatch them.

Chapter 5
Getting to Rome
In This Chapter
 Checking out the major airlines flying into Rome
 Getting to Rome by train, ship, bus, or car
 Sorting out packages and escorted tours
R
ome is the capital of Italy and extremely well connected to other
major cities around the world. You’ll find direct flights to Rome
from a great number of destinations. Most visitors fly to Rome, and you
can also arrive by train from within Europe, by cruise ship, or (although
we don’t recommend it) by car. This chapter outlines all the ways and
means you have to make getting to Rome a snap.
Flying to Rome
If you live near a major city, flying to Rome may be as easy as flying to
another destination in your own country, but it won’t be cheaper. Italy 
is farther from the U.S. than England or France, and airfares are signifi-
cantly higher. A round-trip ticket during peak times can run between
$800 and $2,000, depending on where you start and how far in advance
you book your flight. Of course, with the cutthroat competition among
airlines, you may be able to lock in a much better deal, especially if you
book well in advance and have a flexible itinerary.
Finding out which airlines fly there
Rome is one of Italy’s gateways (the other is Milan), to which you can fly
nonstop from North America and other continents; you can also find lots
of flights to Rome connecting through other European cities.
In general, European airlines offer the most legroom on intercontinental
flights, and U.S. airlines the least, though things are slowly getting more
uniform. Alitalia (% 800-223-5730 in the U.S.; 800-361-8336 in Canada;
020-8814-7700 in the U.K.; 8-8306-8411 in Australia; or 06-2222 in Italy;
www.alitalia.it), the Italian national airline, offers direct flights to
Rome from most major destinations in the world; it also offers connect-
ing flights to every destination in Italy by way of Rome or Milan. Daily
direct flights originate in a number of U.S. cities, including New York and
Boston, as well as Toronto and Montreal. Service on Alitalia is excellent,

with decent space even in economy class, and you’ll be pampered with
good food and wine.
From the United States, check American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.
aa.com), Delta (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com), United (% 800-538-
2929; www.united.com), US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.
com), Continental (% 800-525-0280; www.continental.com), and
Northwest/KLM (% 800-447-4747; www.nwa.com), which offer direct
nonstop flights to Rome or Milan, at least during peak season. Air
Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.com) flies direct from
Toronto to Rome.
From Australia, Qantas (% 13-13-13; www.qantas.com) offers direct
flights daily from Melbourne to Rome, and several days a week from
Sydney.
From Britain, you’ll find direct flights to a number of Italian cities on
Alitalia (% 020-8814-7700; www.alitalia.it) and British Airways
(% 0845-773-3377 in the U.K.; www.britishairways.com). Other
options include Ryanair (% 0871-246-0000; www.ryanair.com) and
EasyJet (% 0871-244-2366 [10p per minute]; www.easyjet.com), which
fill the old no-frills or discount airline slot.
On any day of the week, you can get a connecting flight through a major
European capital with a European national carrier, such as British
Airways (% 800-247-297; www.britishairways.com), Air France
(% 800-237-2747; www.airfrance.com), KLM (% 800-374-7747; www.
klm.nl), and Lufthansa (% 800-645-3880; www.lufthansa-usa.com).
Getting the best deal on your airfare
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But you can often qualify
for the least expensive price, several hundred — or even thousands —
of dollars less than the full fare, if you purchase well in advance.
Keep in mind that the lowest fares are often nonrefundable, require
advance purchase and a certain length of stay, have date-of-travel
restrictions, and carry penalties for changing dates of travel.
The high season for flying to Rome is long and getting longer, and snag-
ging low fares is increasingly difficult; at certain times, you may be lucky
just to get on any plane heading for Italy. But fear not: You don’t have to
pay top dollar. Here are some tips on scoring the best airfare:
 Book in advance and be flexible. Fares can vary by hundreds of
dollars, depending on how far in advance you book, day of the
week, and the season. Airlines offer only a limited number of seats
for each rate, and the cheapest go fast. Passengers who can book far
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
52

in advance (21 days at least), who can stay over Saturday night, or
who are willing to travel on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday will
pay a fraction of the full fare. If your schedule is flexible, say so —
ask if you can secure a cheaper fare by staying an extra day, by
flying midweek, or by flying at less busy hours.
 Shop around for specials. Airlines periodically hold sales, which
tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume; for Rome, that
means the dead of winter. As you plan your vacation, keep your
eyes open for these sales advertised in newspapers and online. 
If you already hold a ticket when a sale breaks, exchanging your
ticket, which usually incurs a $100 to $150 charge, may pay off.
 Consider nondirect flights. To encourage travelers to choose a
nondirect route, round-trip rates are often handsomely discounted,
and connections often involve just an hour or two of layover.
 Join frequent-flier clubs. Accruing miles on one program is best,
so you can rack up free flights and achieve elite status faster. But
opening as many accounts as possible makes sense. It’s free, and
you get the best choice of seats, faster response to phone inquiries,
and prompter service if your luggage is stolen, if your flight is can-
celed or delayed, or if you want to change your seat.
You can also check consolidators, also known as bucket shops. Start by
looking in Sunday newspaper travel sections; U.S. travelers should focus
on the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and Miami Herald. Several
reliable consolidators are worldwide and available on the Net. STA
Travel (% 800-781-4040; www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in
student travel, offers good fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress
(% 800-TRAV-800; www.flights.com) started in Europe and has excel-
lent fares worldwide. Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 coun-
tries. FlyCheap, an industry leader, has become Lowestfare.com (www.
lowestfare.com) and is owned by Priceline (see information later in
this chapter). Air Tickets Direct (% 800-778-3447; www.airtickets
direct.com) is based in Montreal.
Bucket shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or carry stiff cancellation
penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket price,
and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety records.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com)
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different deals
with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same flights, so
shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also send you an
e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to your favorite
destination. Of the smaller ones, SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives
Chapter 5: Getting to Rome 53

good reviews from users; it’s a meta-search site (which finds low fares and
then directs you to airline and hotel Web sites for booking).
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are valid
only for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials,
such as Smarter Living (smarterliving.com). For last-minute trips,
www.lastminute.com often has better deals than the major-label sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over the details, use an opaque
fare service such as Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire (www.
hotwire.com). Both offer rock-bottom prices in exchange for travel on a
“mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a mysterious
change of planes. The airlines are major, well-known carriers — and the
possibility of being sent hither and yon en route to Italy is remote. But
your chances of getting a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. For
example, Hotwire has a “no red eye” check-off, but be aware that in its
system, a 6 a.m. flight for which you have to be at the airport two hours
in advance (it’s hardly worth putting on your jammies, is it?) is not con-
sidered a red eye. Hotwire tells you prices before you buy; Priceline usu-
ally has better deals than Hotwire, but you have to play the “name our
price” game — and with each try, you have to change something besides
your bid. If you have fixed travel dates, make a realistic bid to start, or
you’ll have to change them or look elsewhere. Another Priceline option is
Lowestfare.com (www.lowestfare.com), on which you don’t have bid.
Arriving by Other Means
You may be adding Rome to a larger European vacation, or perhaps you
live in Britain or Ireland. Although usually it will be cheaper and faster to
fly, you do have other ways to get to Italy.
 Train: Railroads in Europe offer cheap, reliable, fast, and frequent
service. Convenient overnight trains with sleeping cars connect
Rome to most European capitals. High-speed TGV trains through
Torino and Milan also connect Paris to Rome. Trenitalia, the Italian
national train service (% 892021; www.trenitalia.it), offers excel-
lent deals on rail passes for both Europe and Italy. Eurailpass grants
unlimited first-class rail travel within most of continental Europe and
comes in several versions for both adults and younger travelers; for
example, an adult 15-day pass costs $588, and the three-month option
is $1,654. The pass also includes discounts on certain bus and ferry
routes. You can buy passes directly at any major European train sta-
tions; in advance from travel agents or rail agents in major cities such
as New York, Montreal, and Los Angeles; and through Rail Europe
(% 877-272-RAIL from the U.S.; www.raileurope.com).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
54

 Ship and Ferry: Arriving by boat has not lost any of its charm in
our frantic modern world, and if you have the time to visit Europe
by cruise ship, we recommend the experience. Two harbors,
Fiumicino and Civitavecchia, serve Rome. Most cruise ships and
many ferries from destinations around the Mediterranean arrive in
Civitavecchia, about one hour north of Rome and easy to reach by
frequent train and bus service, as well as car service. A number of
ferry companies (such as the lines to Sardinia) serve Fiumicino, a
35-minute ride from Rome by metropolitan train or car service.
 Bus: Eurolines (% 0990-143-219; www.eurolines.com) is the lead-
ing operator of scheduled coach services across Europe. Service to
Rome departs from London’s Victoria Coach Station.
 Car: We don’t recommend driving, even if it may appear tempting.
It is expensive (you have to factor in gasoline at over $7 a gallon
and highways tolls), exhausting, and long — Rome lies at about 500
miles from the Italian border. If you have the time and stamina,
though, Rome is at the intersection of all major highways from the
Italian border (thanks to the ancient Romans, who designed the
main road network still in use today): All roads really do lead to
Rome. Make sure you get a good map (the Italian Touring Club’s are
the best, followed by Michelin’s).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours: The tour
company takes care of all the details — from the itinerary to the meals,
hotels, and attractions tickets and reservations — and your group leader
smoothes over the occasional bumps along the road. The company tells
you what to expect each day, you know what your vacation will cost up
front, and you don’t get many surprises. Fans of escorted tours know
that they can take you to the maximum number of sights in the mini-
mum amount of time with the least hassle. We give you some tips in this
section on how to choose the escorted tour that best fits your needs.
If you decide to take an escorted tour, we strongly recommend buying
travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay up front.
It’s wise to buy travel insurance through an independent agency. (Read
more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, find out whether you must put down a
deposit and when final payment is due, then ask a few simple questions.
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the operator cancel the trip if
it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel? Do you get
a refund if you cancel? If the company cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Do tour organizers try to fit 25
hours into a 24-hour day, or is there ample time for relaxing and
Chapter 5: Getting to Rome 55

shopping? Some escorted tours schedule every minute from 7 a.m.
to 6 or 7 p.m.; if that sounds like a grind, they are not for you.
 How big is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size, and the operator may cancel the tour if it doesn’t book
enough people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close
the tour you’re interested in is to reaching it.
 What is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to pay to
get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be included
in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexibility do
you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does the bus
leave once a day, with no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in
advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody
get the same chicken cutlet?
Many international companies specialize in escorted tours to Rome.
Here is brief list of the most reliable operators.
 Italiatours.com (www.italiatour.com) is part of the Alitalia
Group; it offers a variety of low-cost tours. This is the only tour
operator with a desk right at the Fiumicino airport in Rome and
native expertise, and it offers very competitive prices.
 Perillo Tours, 577 Chestnut Ridge Rd., Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07675-9888
(% 800-431-1515 or 201-307-1234; www.perillotours.com), has
been in business for more than half a century. Its diverse itineraries
range from 8 to 15 days. Optional excursions are offered (at an extra
charge) to allow you to customize your tour somewhat. Perillo tries
to cover all the bases; it even has a package to help you get married
in Rome.
 Globus+Cosmos Tours (% 800-338-7092; www.globusandcosmos.
com) offers first-class escorted coach tours lasting 8 to 16 days.
 Insight Vacations (% 800-582-8380; www.insightvacations.com)
books superior first-class, fully escorted motor-coach tours.
 Central Holidays (% 800-935-5000; www.centralholidays.
com) offers several levels of fully escorted tours — and levels of
“escort” — in addition to packages.
 For luxurious tours of Italy, check out Abercrombie & Kent,
1520 Kensington Rd., Oak Brook, IL 60523 (% 800-554-7016; www.
abercrombiekent.com; London address: Sloan Square House,
Holbein Place, London SW1W 8NS; % 020-7730-9600).
You can also choose from an increasing number of tours addressing 
special interests such as archeology or cuisine. La Dolce Vita Wine
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
56

Tours (% 888-746-0022; www.dolcetours.com) focuses on wine;
PaginediGusto (% 0461-829964; fax: 0461-429756; www.paginedi
gusto.com) organizes gastronomic and culinary tours in Italy, including
one focusing on the Eternal City. Good resource Web sites for specialty
tours and travels are the Specialty Travel Index (www.specialty
travel.com), which offers a comprehensive selection of tours;
ShawGuides (www.shawguides.com), with links to many offerings, 
ranging from archaeological programs to tours for opera fans; and
InfoHub Specialty Travel Guide (www.infohub.com).
Choosing a Package Tour
Package tours — airfare-plus-hotel bundles that may include excursions
or activities — are a smart way to visit Rome. In many cases, a package
including airfare, hotel, and transportation to and from the airport costs
less than the hotel alone would if you booked it yourself. That’s because
tour operators buy packages in bulk and resell them to the public.
Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; others provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some use sched-
uled airlines; others sell charters. In some packages, your choice of
accommodations and travel days may be limited.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of travel magazines such as Travel &
Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler. Liberty
Travel (% 888-271-1584 to find the store nearest you; www.liberty-
travel.com), one of the biggest packagers in the Northeastern United
States, usually has a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines Vaca-
tions (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations (% 800-
221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines Vacations
(% 800-301-3800; www.coolvacations.com), US Airways Vacations
(% 800-455-0123 or 800-422-3861; www.usairwaysvacations.com), and
United Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com).
Several big online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz,
Site59, and Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If
you’re unsure about a packager’s pedigree, check with the Better
Business Bureau in company’s home city, or visit www.bbb.org. If a
packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
The escorted tour operators discussed earlier also offer packages. 
For example, Italiatours.com (% 800-845-3365; fax 212-765-2183; www.
italiatour.com) specializes in packages for travelers who ride from
one destination to another by train or rental car. Another recommended
packager is Kemwel (% 800-678-0678; www.kemwel.com).

E
very traveler is a special traveler, but bringing kids along or trying
to find wheelchair-accessible accommodations and attractions
requires extra care and thought. Seniors may be interested in special
programs and activities; gays and lesbians may wonder how friendly and
welcoming Rome will be. We consider these issues in this chapter.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
You may think that Rome, a large and congested capital city, is a difficult
destination for kids. True, parks are few in the historic center, and kid-
specific entertainment and services are rare or nonexistent. But if you
follow our suggestions and avoid some common pitfalls, you may find
Rome your favorite urban destination ever.
In Italy, kids do everything with the family. The downside is that you’ll
have a hard time finding places to park your offspring; the upside is that
your kids will be welcome virtually anywhere. Restaurants will do what
they can to accommodate youngsters, even preparing simple dishes that
are not on the menu. Bars (which are more like cafes), bakeries, and
other food shops will offer your cute little one a sliver of pizza, a sweet,
or a piece of candy just to get a smile in return. Hotels will provide you
with a cot or extra bed for your child, and most have rooms (often
duplexes or suites) geared for families. These units, which accommo-
date four or even five, book up quickly, especially in high season.
The key to a fun visit is planning. First, try to schedule your trip during
the fair season. Rome never experiences bitter cold, but it always has a
couple of weeks in winter (usually in January) that are particularly cold

and wet. Most important, skip the sultry days of midsummer, especially
if you come from a colder climate. July and August may prove unbear-
able for young tourists, unless you keep to the locals’ schedule: out
between 8 and 11 a.m., indoors in the cool until 5 or 5:30 p.m., and then
out again until evening falls and beyond. Planning for a siesta in the
afternoon is not a bad idea at all. To make all this easier, choose accom-
modations in the heart of Rome’s historic center. Being able to walk to
and from all major attractions offers unlimited advantages.
Another important tip: Children of all ages hate to wait in lines, particu-
larly to see something they are only marginally interested in. Strictly
follow our tips to avoid lines and crowds (see individual entries in
Chapter 11), and keep your timetable light: only one big attraction per
day, or two or three small ones.
Also, involve your children in the planning, letting them choose the main
attraction whenever possible. As your second attraction for the day,
always schedule something your kids will enjoy or have chosen them-
selves. Also, splurge on Rome Past and Present, a book with plastic over-
lays, showing the ruins as they looked in Roman times (see Chapter 11).
Ruins are not the only option: Children are usually very sensitive to
beauty (often surprising their parents), and many sights in Rome are so
beautiful that even the youngest will be impressed. St. Peter’s Basilica,
for example, is an experience you can certainly share.
Throughout this book, we have marked the attractions that usually get
kids’ approval with the Kids icon.
Always schedule an age-appropriate fun break during the day: a stop at
the Pincio Gardens merry-go-round, Villa Borghese Park (carry a base-
ball, tennis ball, or Frisbee), or, for younger kids, the gardens behind the
Golden House of Nero (see Chapter 11).
Last but not least, Rome is the home of the world’s best ice cream and
pizza. Pizza parlors (see Chapter 10) — both eat-in and take-out — are
ubiquitous and make an excellent (and reasonably priced) dining choice
for a family. High-quality ice cream is available on almost every corner
and makes a perfect break for tired young visitors and their parents,
especially in the warmer months (see Chapter 10). We suggest you 
make a midafternoon ice cream break a central point of your planning.
Schedule your break for around 4:30 or 5 p.m.; few restaurants serve
dinner before 7:30 p.m.
Meal planning is another area that requires attention when you are travel-
ing with kids. Renting an apartment with a kitchen is the best option if you
have very young or finicky kids; if you have to rely on restaurants, you
need to adjust to later eating hours. Restaurants open around 12:30 p.m.
for lunch and 7:30 p.m. or later for dinner; only take-out places and tourist
joints serve food earlier.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 59

Baby changing may be a problem. You’ll find changing tables only in
modern museums and airports. Bathrooms in larger hotels and large
nicer restaurants may have a table or flat surface you can use, but some-
times you may have to settle for using your stroller. If you find yourself
in difficulty, always ask a local.
If you’re sightseeing with a stroller, prepare yourself for a crash course
in cobblestone street navigation. It’s not easy, especially with badly
parked cars everywhere and mopeds zooming through, but it is feasible.
Kids less than 1m (39 in.) tall travel free on urban public transportation,
but avoid public transportation at rush hours (about 8:15–9:30 a.m. and
5–7:30 p.m.), particularly in summer: Children hate to be crushed and
uncomfortable. Definitely splurge on taxis.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
In general, Romans accord older people a great deal of respect, probably
because of the Roman embrace of extended family as well as the culture
and nature of the Italian language (polite forms of address are to be used
when speaking with someone who is older than you). Therefore, you’re
unlikely to encounter ageism.

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome

Being a senior entitles you to some terrific travel bargains. Many reliable
agencies and organizations target the 50-plus market and offer trips to
Rome. Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges
study programs for those ages 55 and over (and a spouse or companion
of any age) in the United States and in more than 80 countries around
the world. Most courses last five to seven days in the United States (two
to four weeks abroad), and many include airfare, accommodations in
university dormitories or modest inns, meals, and tuition. ElderTreks
(% 800-741-7956; www.eldertreks.com) offers small-group tours to
off-the-beaten-path or adventure-travel locations, restricted to travelers
50 and older.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.travel
50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures for the
Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers, available
from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617/350-7500; www.
gct.com); The 50+ Traveler’s Guidebook (St. Martin’s Press); and
Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50 (McGraw-Hill).
Senior discounts on admission at theaters, museums, and public trans-
portation are subject to reciprocity between countries. Because the
United States and Italy don’t have a bilateral agreement (you discount
us, and we’ll discount you), Americans aren’t eligible for senior dis-
counts in Italy. (The same rule applies to the under-17 discount.) All 
discounts apply if you are a citizen of a European Union country.
Accessing Rome: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anybody from traveling, and more
options and resources are available than ever before. Rome is working
to make its treasures more accessible, but it’s a slow process.
Although Italy may not be as advanced as some other countries in its
accessibility, Rome, as the capital, is more in step with the times than
other destinations. But keep in mind that the age of the housing stock
and the difficulty of retrofitting medieval buildings with elevators or
ramps pose serious limits. Some major buildings and institutions have
been converted; others have not been or cannot be adapted. Calling
ahead is always best. When a special entrance for visitors with disabili-
ties exists, you’ll often need to arrange to have an attendant meet you
there. Public transportation reserves spaces for the disabled, and the
Roman transportation authority has kneeling busses that make getting
in and out quite easy. Some train stations and bus lines, though, can
prove difficult, even impossible, if you’re in a wheelchair. Major towns
have special grooves on the sidewalks to help the visually impaired with
street crossing, and a number of street lights have sound signals.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 61

You can avoid some problems by joining a tour that caters specifically to
your needs. Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries
for travelers with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005;
www.flyingwheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that
emphasize sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able
Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers exten-
sive access information and advice for traveling around the world with
disabilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339;
www.disabilitytravel.com) caters to wheelchair travelers and their
families and friends.
Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include
MossRehab Hospital (www.mossresourcenet.org), which provides a
library of accessible-travel resources online, and SATH, the Society for
Accessible Travel and Hospitality (% 212-447-7284; www.sath.org;
annual membership fees: $45 adults, $30 seniors and students), which
offers a wealth of travel resources for people with all types of disabilities,
and informed recommendations on destinations, access guides, travel
agents, tour operators, vehicle rentals, and companion services. The
American Foundation for the Blind (% 800-232-5463; www.afb.org)

Following the Rainbow: Resources for 
Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Rome is a very tolerant city in a fairly tolerant country, and violent dis-
plays such as gay bashing are quite unheard of. However, as in the
United States, an active gay and lesbian movement is trying to raise
public consciousness about prejudice and discrimination.
Rome has an active gay life; check out the local branch of ARCI-Gay/ARCI-
Lesbica (www.arcigay.it/roma), the country’s leading gay organization.
Its Web site has an English-language version. The Eternal City can boast of
having held the first-ever World Pride event in Italy in July 2000, to coin-
cide with the Jubilee celebrations. During the summer, coinciding with the
Estate Romana festival, the town-within-a-town known as Gay Village
(www.gayvillage.it) lets gay and straight mingle while enjoying a vari-
ety of cultural events (see Chapters 15 and 16).
The International Gay & Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-448-

 Making sure you stay healthy while traveling
 Keeping connected when you travel
 Understanding airline security measures
E
ven if you have a destination, an itinerary, and a ticket in hand, you
aren’t going anywhere until you get a passport. You also need to
figure out whether you need a rental car, whether to get traveler’s insur-
ance, and how you want to stay in touch with the folks back home. In
this chapter, we help you tie up all the loose ends.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without it. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time. For an up-to-date,
country-by-country listing of passport requirements around the world,
visit the Foreign Entry Requirement Web page of the U.S. Department of
State at http://travel.state.gov/foreignentryreqs.html.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport office;
a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office (you can
download the form online; see below).
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or social
security card is also a good idea.)

3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2 × 2 inches.
You often find businesses that take these photos near a passport
office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a vending machine.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $85. For those 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $70.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes three weeks but can take longer during busy periods
(especially spring).
If you already have a passport in your current name that was issued
within the past 15 years (and you were over age 16 when it was issued),
you can renew the passport by mail for $55.
Whether you’re applying in person or by mail, you can download 
passport applications from the U.S. Department of State Web site at
http://travel.state.gov, where you can also get general information
and find your regional passport office; alternatively, call the National
Passport Information Center (% 877-487-2778 for automated informa-
tion, or % 202-647-0518).
Losing your passport may be worse than losing your money. Why?
Because a passport shows (and proves to authorities) that you are you.
Safeguard your passport in an inconspicuous, inaccessible place such as
a money belt. Always carry a photocopy of your passport with you, in a
separate pocket or purse. If you lose your passport, visit the nearest
consulate of your native country as soon as possible for a replacement.
Applying for other passports
Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or visit www.passports.gov.au for details on how and
where to apply.
Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada, at post offices, or from the central Passport Office, Department
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 
(% 800-567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be accompanied
by two identical passport-sized photographs and proof of Canadian citi-
zenship. Processing takes five to ten days if you apply in person, or
about three weeks by mail.
New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New Zealand
Passports Office or download it from the Web site. Contact the Passports
Office (% 0800-225-050 in New Zealand or 04-474-8100; www.passports.
govt.nz) for more information.
United Kingdom residents can pick up applications for a standard ten-
year passport (five-year passport for children under 16) at passport
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
64

offices, major post offices, or a travel agency. For information, contact
the United Kingdom Passport Service (% 0870-521-0410; www.ips.
gov.uk).
When you get your passport photos taken, ask for six to eight total
photos if you plan to apply for an International Driving Permit and an
international student or teacher ID, which may entitle you to discounts
at museums. Take the extra photos with you. You may need one for
random reasons on the road, and if — heaven forbid — you ever lose
your passport, you can use them for a replacement request.
Renting a Car — Not!
Rome’s historic district is closed to nonresident traffic, and its narrow
streets can be a nightmare to negotiate. If you must drive, it is imperative
that you get a good map marking the driving direction for each street
(they are for sale at tobacconists and newsstands as you approach
Rome). Then you’ll have to find parking, an almost impossible proposi-
tion. In all likelihood, you’ll end up parking your vehicle in a garage
(expect to pay 18€–36€/$23–$47 per day if you have a deal through your
hotel, more otherwise) and using public transportation and taxis, which
is the best way to go (see Chapter 8).
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost luggage insurance. The cost varies widely,
but expect to pay between 5 percent and 8 percent of the price of the
vacation. Here is our advice on all three.
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip or go home early, or if your travel sup-
plier goes bankrupt. Permissible reasons for cancellation can range
from sickness to natural disasters to the Department of State’s
declaring your destination unsafe for travel, but not vague fears
caused by airplane crashes and the like. If you are worried about
flying, check out “Travel Guard Alerts,” a list of companies consid-
ered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travelguard.
com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a
credit card — by law, consumers can get their money back on
goods and services not received if they report the loss within 
60 days after the charge appears on their statement.
 Most health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not provide
coverage for travel overseas, and the ones that do often require you
to pay for services up front and reimburse you only after you return
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 65

home. Even if your plan does cover overseas treatment, most out-of-
country hospitals make you pay your bills up front, then send you 
a refund only after you’ve returned home and filed the necessary
paperwork with your insurance company. As a safety net, you may
want to buy travel medical insurance; try MEDEX Assistance
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for
general information on services, call the company’s Worldwide
Assistance Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
 Lost luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up
to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see if your valuables are
covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage insurance as
part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or buy
Travel Guard’s “BagTrak” product. Don’t buy insurance at the air-
port, where it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables 
or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended insur-
ers: AccessAmerica (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com);
Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com);
Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.
com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.
travelex-insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Talk to your doctor before leaving if you have a serious or chronic ill-
ness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart problems, wear
a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.medicalert.
org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition and gives
them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hotline.
Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance to
Travelers (% 716-754-4883 or, in Canada, 416-652-0137; www.iamat.
org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the countries you’re visit-
ing and lists of English-speaking doctors. The United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.cdc.gov) pro-
vides up-to-date information on health hazards by region or country and
offers tips on food safety.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Rome 
66

If you get sick in Rome, ask the concierge at your hotel to recommend a
local doctor — even his or her own, if necessary. If you can’t locate a
doctor, try contacting your embassy or consulate; they maintain lists of
English-speaking doctors. For an emergency, dial % 113 for the police:
They can call an ambulance or help you in many ways. If your situation
is life-threatening, call % 118 for an ambulance; or rush to the pronto
soccorso (emergency department) at the local hospital.
Under the Italian national health-care system, you’re eligible only for free
emergency care. If you’re admitted to a hospital as an inpatient, even
through the emergency department, you’re required to pay (unless
you’re a resident of the European Economic Area and are eligible for
health insurance coverage). You’re also required to pay for follow-up
care. For the names, addresses, and phone numbers of hospitals offering
24-hour emergency care, see the “Fast Facts” section in Appendix A.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
If you’re from England or another European country, you’re in luck: Your
phone works in Italy. If you’re from another continent, things are a little
complicated. The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless
capabilities are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless net-
work that makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe
and dozens of other countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile and AT&T
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and some Rogers
customers are GSM. All Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system and you have a world-capable
multiband phone (such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models), you can make and receive calls across much of the globe. Just
call your wireless operator and ask for “international roaming” to be
activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be
high — usually $1 to $1.50 in Western Europe.
That’s why it’s important to buy an “unlocked” world phone from the
get-go. Many cellphone operators sell “locked” phones that restrict you
from using any removable computer memory phone chip card (called a
SIM card) other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone
allows you to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer)
in your destination country. (Show your phone to the salesperson; not
all phones work on all networks.) You’ll get a local phone number — 
and much, much lower calling rates. Getting an already locked phone
unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can be done; just call your
cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad for several months and
want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many, renting a phone is a good idea. You can rent from any number
of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental agencies,
but we suggest making arrangements before you leave home. That way
you can give loved ones and business associates your new number,
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 67

make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever you go —
especially helpful for overseas trips through several countries. Phone
rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus airtime
fees of at least $1 a minute. In Europe, local rental companies often offer
free incoming calls within their home country, which can save you big
bucks. Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800-
872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or
905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com). Provide your itinerary, and the com-
pany will tell you what wireless products you need. InTouch will also, 
for free, advise you on whether your existing phone will work overseas;
simply call % 703-222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern time, or
go to http://intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
In Italy, you don’t have to look for a place to rent a phone; you can make
the phone come to you. Rentacell (% 877-736-8355 in the U.S.; 39-02-
8633-7799 in Italy; www.rentacell.com) will deliver a phone anywhere,
free. You can also pick it up in the U.S. before you leave. Incoming calls
are free. Easyline (% 800-010-600 in Italy) also delivers phones free.
Accessing the Internet away from home
Travelers have any number of ways to check their e-mail and access the
Internet. Using your PDA (personal digital assistant) or electronic organ-
izer will give you the most flexibility, but Internet points are so wide-
spread nowadays that you really don’t need to carry a laptop. You’ll find
that most hotels — medium range and up — offer at least an Internet
point. Some offer Wi-Fi everywhere in the hotel, others Internet connec-
tion through the TV in each room. Often this service is free; some lodg-
ings charge a small fee. Check with your hotel. Avoid hotel business
centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
Rome also has a great number of cybercafes. Although there’s no defini-
tive directory, two places to start looking are www.cybercaptive.com
and www.cybercafe.com (but be aware that their listings are not com-
prehensive). The concierge at your hotel will direct you to the closest
Internet point.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. Fiumicino airport has them; they give you basic Web access
for a per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. The
kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices mean they should be avoided when-
ever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If it doesn’t,
you can use the free mail2web service (www.mail2web.com) to view
and reply to your home e-mail. For more flexibility, you may want to open
a free, Web-based e-mail account such as Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.
yahoo.com), Gmail (http://mail.google.com), or Microsoft’s Hotmail
(www.hotmail.com). Your home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail
to the Web-based account automatically.

If you need access to files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). It provides a Web-based inter-
face and allows you to manipulate a distant PC from anywhere — even a
cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an always-on con-
nection to the Internet. The service offers top-quality security, but if
you’re worried about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cyber-
cafe computer to access the GoToMyPC system.
If you are bringing your own computer, you’ll find that most top hotels in
Rome offer free Wi-Fi connection. (To locate free hot spots, check www.
personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.) Most lap-
tops have built-in Wi-Fi capability. Mac owners have their own network-
ing technology, Apple AirPort. For those with older computers, a Wi-Fi
card (around $50) can be plugged into your laptop. If you don’t want to
bum a connection, you can sign up for wireless access much as you do
cellphone service. T-Mobile Hotspot (http://hotspot.t-mobile.com)
serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks coffee
shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.
wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class hotel 
lobbies. IPass providers (see below) also give you access to a few hun-
dred hotel lobby wireless setups. The companies’ pricing policies can be
byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute
plans, but in general you pay around $30 a month for limited access —
and as more and more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon,
prices are likely to get even more competitive.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by placing a local call. Check your ISP’s Web site
or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your current account
away from home, and how much it will cost. If you’re traveling outside the
reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up numbers in most of the
world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an iPass provider, which will
then tell you how to set up your computer for your destination(s). For a
list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click on “Individual
Purchase.” One solid provider is i2roam (www.i2roam.com; % 866-811-
6209 or 920-235-0475).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a phone cord, and an Ethernet network cable — or find out
whether your hotel supplies them to guests. For information on the 
electric current in Rome, see the “Fast Facts” section in Appendix A.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she may whisk you to the front of the line.
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 69

Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries, including Italy.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. Passengers with E-tickets can beat the ticket-counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
their home computers. If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the
credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print
out your boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the secu-
rity checkpoint with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or
looking to snag an exit-row seat, you will be able to do so using most air-
line kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are employing the kiosk system, but
always call your airline to make sure these alternatives are available.
Curbside check-in is also a good way to avoid lines, although a few air-
lines still ban it; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines remain unpredictable. If you have trouble
standing for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will
provide a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects
such as big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from
your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in
mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for
folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are
okay, and liquids and gels in quantities greater than 3 ounces are a no-
no. Bring solid food in your carry-on rather than checking it; explosive-
detection machines used on checked luggage have been known to
mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs.
Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a “personal
item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders can
stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it,
it’s still considered a personal item. For the current list of restricted
items; check the TSA’s Web site (www.tsa.gov/public/index.jsp).
Advance reservations
Because of the long lines at busy times, many museums and attractions
in Rome offer advance ticketing. You can make reservations before you
leave home (and avoid a wait of up to three hours at the local ticket
booth). Check under each listing in Chapter 11 for the procedure. We
definitely recommend you make reservations for the Vatican Museums
and Sistine chapel (booking a tour) and the Borghese Gallery.

Part III
Settling into Rome

In this part . . .
T
his is where we provide all the logistical information
you’ll need to make your way around the city, ﬁnd a com-
fortable bed, and eat a delicious meal.
In Chapter 8, we give you a few tips about Rome’s airports and
other entry points, and how to get from there to your accom-
modations. We also provide a detailed description of the
city’s neighborhoods and suggest the best ways to get around
in Rome. In Chapter 9, we recommend our favorite Roman
hotels — in a number of price categories and locations — and
offer tips for reserving the best room at the best rate. In
Chapter 10, we tell you what to expect from Roman restau-
rants and offer extensive reviews of our favorite choices, as
well as provide handy lists of restaurants by neighborhood,
price, and cuisine. And because you’ll need some snacks to
keep you going between meals, we give you the scoop on
snacks such as pizza and gelato.

 Arriving in Rome
 Acquainting yourself with the neighborhoods
 Finding information after you arrive
 Getting from place to place
A
rriving in a foreign city is always a challenge, and although Rome
isn’t one of the largest cities in the world, it is large enough to be
confusing, and the narrow, winding streets of the historic center are a
maze, even for Romans! In this chapter, we give you all the information
you need to negotiate the Eternal City like a native.
Navigating Your Way through 
Passport Control and Customs
To enter Italy, you need a passport. Because Italy is part of the group 
of European countries that have unified their passport and Customs pro-
cedures under the Schengen agreement, your passport is checked as
soon as you enter European or Italian territory, whichever comes first. 
If you’ve already landed in a European country that is part of the
Schengen area, chances are that you won’t need to show your passport
again — only spot checks are performed at the Italian border. If Rome is
your first port of call in Europe, you’ll have to line up for passport con-
trol; often, you’ll find two lines: one for European Union citizens and one
for everyone else. If everything is okay with your passport, you’ll be
allowed in — but don’t expect your passport to be stamped.
While you’re on Italian soil, you’re required to have your passport with
you at all times, and you can be asked to produce it at any time to prove
your identity and your legal status. All hotels will ask to see your pass-
port when you check in. Carry your passport in a safe place on your
person (such as a document pouch worn under your clothes), or leave
the original in the safe at your hotel and carry a photocopy.

Items for personal use enter duty free up to 175€ ($210) for each adult
and 90€ ($108) for each child under 15. In addition, adults can import 
a maximum of 200 cigarettes (50 cigars), 1 liter (slightly more than 
1 quart) of liquor or 2 liters of wine, 50 grams of perfume, 500 grams 
(1 pound) of coffee, and 100 grams (3 ounces) of tea; children are
allowed only perfume. Also, you cannot bring currency in excess of
10,329€ ($12,395 at press time, subject to the fluctuating conversion
rate). See Appendix A for Customs regulations regarding what you can
bring home. You can find more information at the Italian Customs Web
site (www.agenziadogane.it).
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
It’s still true that all roads lead to Rome, but nowadays, so do all planes,
trains, coaches, and even ferries.
Arriving by plane
Rome’s main airport, Leonardo da Vinci, is in Fiumicino, and this is
where you’re likely to land if you come by plane. Charter flights and
some European companies serve the smaller airport of Ciampino.
If you arrive at Fiumicino airport
Though it’s officially named after Leonardo, everybody refers to this air-
port as Fiumicino (% 06-65951; www.adr.it), after the nearby town.
The airport is compact and very well organized (but ever expanding),
with three terminals connected by a long corridor: Terminal A handles
domestic travel; Terminal B handles domestic and Schengen European
Community flights (that is, internal flights to the EC countries that have
signed a special agreement to waive Customs controls); and Terminal C
manages all other international flights. If you’re flying direct from a U.S.
airport, Terminal C is your likely point of entry. Terminal C is connected
to a newer set of gates by a cool monorail.
Don’t be concerned if you see police officers with submachine guns
walking around — it’s routine procedure, and one to be glad of. Be
aware, though, that the security forces at Fiumicino have terrorists in
mind, not common thieves. You still have to watch your belongings like
a hawk, and don’t leave anything precious in your checked luggage.
After exiting passport control and Customs, you enter the main con-
course, a long hall that connects all three terminals. There you’ll find
ATMs (one per terminal) as well as 24-hour currency exchange machines
and a cambio (change) office, open from 8:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. and
located just outside Customs in the international arrivals area.
If you’re using traveler’s checks, you may want to change them at the
cambio office — its rates are usually the best in town.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
74

The airport terminal has a very good tourist information desk (% 06-
65956074) that provides information on Rome at one end and on the
rest of Italy at the other. Nearby is a help desk that arranges last-minute
hotel reservations but doesn’t cover all hotels in Rome. Public trans-
portation — including taxis and car-rental shuttle buses — is outside
the terminal along the sidewalk; the train station is on the second floor
of a building attached to the international terminal by an overpass.
Fiumicino lies about 30km (18 miles) from Rome and is well connected
by highway, train, shuttle, and bus. The easiest way to get to your hotel
is by taking a taxi. The line forms on the curb just outside the terminals
and is marked by a sign; taxis are white and have a meter. The
Municipality of Rome recently introduced a flat rate from Fiumicino
Airport; the fare is 40€ ($52) for the 50-minute ride (well over an hour 
at rush hour) to any destination in the historic center and vicinity.
Unfortunately, the Municipality of Fiumicino imposes a flat rate of 60€
($78) — the difference is justified because the Fiumicino-licensed taxis
cannot pick up passengers in Rome to bring back and must make the
return trip empty. At press time this annoying local quirk (passengers
cannot choose a taxi in the line) was being discussed; we hope a solu-
tion will be found before you arrive in Rome, because otherwise you’ll
have to accept your lot and be prepared to shell out the extra money.
Although they have almost disappeared, beware of gypsy cab drivers
who approach you as you exit the arrival gate. They don’t have meters
and charge a lot more than the regulated cab rates.
Taking the train-shuttle into Rome is equally simple — and a lot faster
during rush hour. If you have a lot of luggage, you can hire help at the
baggage-claim area for 2€ ($2.60) per item; the attendant will take your
bags to the train. The railroad terminal is connected to the air terminal
through a corridor on the second floor outside arrivals (follow the sign
marked TRENI). The best train is the Leonardo Express, a 35-minute shut-
tle ride to Termini (Rome’s central rail station), which runs daily every
30 minutes from 6:37 a.m. to 11:37 p.m. and costs 9.50€ ($12). There also
is a cheaper local commuter train (look for a train with final destination
Orte or Fara Sabina), which makes various stops along the way and
within Rome but doesn’t stop at Termini. It takes about 40 minutes,
depending on your stop, and runs every 15 minutes Monday through
Saturday and every 30 minutes on Sunday. The fare is about 5€ ($6.50).
Get off at Roma Ostiense if your hotel is in the area of the Aventino or
the Colosseum; Roma Trastevere for Trastevere, San Pietro, or Prati; or
Roma Tiburtina for the Porta Pia or Villa Borghese area. The booth in
the terminal sells tickets for both trains. Remember to stamp your ticket
at one of the small yellow validation boxes before you board the train.
If you are planning to take the commuter train and will use public trans-
portation in Rome, consider buying a day pass (see “Getting Around
Rome,” later in this chapter) at the tobacconist in the railroad terminal.
Use it to get from the airport to Rome because the ride is included (the
Leonardo Express is not included).
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 75

Whichever train you take, a taxi stand is located immediately outside
the train stations upon your arrival. You can also take public transporta-
tion. Ranks of buses, with signs indicating their numbers and routes,
stop in front of the train station; the subway is underneath the station.
Finally, you can take a bus shuttle into Rome. Terravision (% 06-
79494572; www.terravision.it) runs a shuttle to Termini station and
to Tiburtina station, with stops at a few major hotels. It costs 9€ ($12),
5€ ($6.50) for children ages 2 to 12.
Note: We do not recommend renting a car at the airport and driving it
into Rome. See Chapter 7 for additional information.
If you arrive at Ciampino airport
A number of international charter flights and some companies that
mainly serve Europe use Ciampino (% 06-794941 or 06-79340297), 16km
(10 miles) from the center of Rome. The airport has few services; it’s
almost like an American civil-aviation airport.
Taxis are by far the easiest way to get to town from Ciampino. The flat
rate is 40€ ($52) for the 45-minute trip. You can also take a shuttle bus;
Terravision (% 06-79494572; www.terravision.it) schedules service
in concert with Ryanair flights, and Schiaffini runs a shuttle coinciding
with EasyJet flights. Both take you to Termini station for 8€ ($10); tick-
ets are sold at the Hotel Royal Santina and at the Hotel Stromboli on Via
Marsala, just across from the Termini train station.
Arriving by ship
If you’re coming by sea, your ocean liner will dock in the harbor of
Civitavecchia (about 80 km/50 miles north of Rome). There, you can
catch one of the frequent coaches and trains to Rome’s Termini or
Tiburtina station. Trains leave every about 20 minutes for the hour-long
ride to Rome, with direct coaches departing every hour.
You can call a taxi from either the harbor or the train station; dial 
% 0766-26121 or 0766-24251, should none be available at the taxi stand.
You can also arrange for limousine service from the harbor. The best 
no-frills service is Rome Shuttle Limousine (% 348-5141804 or 06-
61969084; www.romeshuttlelimousine.com); it offers Civitavecchia-to-
Rome transfer for 110€ ($143) for a maximum of four people. Best Limos
in Rome (% 338-4289389; www.bestlimosinrome.com) is an English-
speaking company based in Rome that specializes in seaport services.
Another good company is Romalimo (% 800-999669 or 06-5414663;
www.romalimo.com).
By train
Rome is a major railroad hub, offering service to every domestic and
international destination. Italy’s Trenitalia train service (% 892021;
www.trenitalia.it) is excellent: cheap, reliable, and frequent. No
Part III: Settling into Rome 
76

fewer than six railway stations are in the center of Rome. The central
and largest is Termini (% 800-431784), and the second-busiest is
Tiburtina. Trains usually stop at one or the other.
At Termini station, public toilets and luggage checks are at either end 
of the platform area. Exits near platforms 1 and 22 lead to the main con-
course, a long commercial gallery with a bar to the north and a phar-
macy to the south; in between are many newsstands, a tobacconist, a
travel agency, ATMs, and a cambio office, as well as information booths.
One floor below you’ll find a mall complete with a large bookstore,
supermarket, cosmetics store, shoe-repair shop, and ATMs; here also is
the entrance to the subway (see “Getting Around Rome,” later in this
chapter). Continuing in a straight line across the gallery above, you
reach the main hall, where train tickets are sold at the windows and 
at automatic machines. You can exit to the street at either end of the
gallery (where you’ll find small taxi stands), or from the main hall, open-
ing onto Piazza dei Cinquecento, the largest bus terminal in Rome. The
main taxi stand is just outside the main hall near the metro sign on the
right. For some mysterious reason, the line forms at the end farthest
from the train station exit, so depending on how many people are wait-
ing, you may have to walk a bit (see rates and the gypsy cab warning
earlier in this chapter).
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Rome started outgrowing its ancient Roman and medieval walls (some of
which are still standing in places) only in the 20th century, but it has
seen immense urban sprawl over the past two decades. From the older
central body, arms of new development have formed along the main
roads heading out of the city, and lately, modern developments have
filled the space in between. As a result, Rome is quite large — it is Italy’s
largest city. The city is divided by the river Tevere (Tiber), which mean-
ders southward, leaving about a third of the city on its western bank and
the rest on its eastern bank.
On the eastern bank of the Tevere is the political, cultural, commercial,
and tourist heart of the city. About three millennia of consecutive layers
of urban development have created a confused layout of streets, with
tiny medieval roads crossed by larger and more recent avenues. At the
east end on Piazza dei Cinquecento is Termini — Rome’s main train sta-
tion and major public transportation hub. Branching out of Piazza dei
Cinquecento is Via Cavour, heading toward the Colosseum. From the
connected Piazza della Repubblica departs Via Barberini, which leads
into Via Veneto and Via del Tritone; and Via Nazionale, which descends
to Piazza Venezia and continues — as Via del Plebiscito, then Corso
Vittorio Emanuele II — all the way to the River Tiber, and as Via della
Conciliazione across it to St. Peter’s and the Vatican. The major cross
streets at Piazza Venezia are Via del Corso and Via dei Fori Imperiali,
joining Piazza del Popolo at one end, and the Colosseum at the other.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 79

Beyond the Colosseum starts Via Appia, the first highway created by
the ancient Romans. A section of it has been transformed into an archae-
ological and natural park (see Chapter 12).
On the western bank of the Tevere you’ll find the Janiculum hill over-
looking the neighborhood of Trastevere, as well as the Vatican, whose
major feature is St. Peter’s Basilica. North of the Vatican is the largish
area called Prati, crossed by the busy Via Cola di Rienzo and Via
Ottaviano.
We have divided the historic center of Rome into several smaller neigh-
borhoods; all are desirable places to stay, with lively nightlife, restau-
rants, and cafes nearby. The neighborhoods are identified on the “Rome
Orientation” map in this chapter.
Aventino
This elegant residential neighborhood is one of the original seven hills of
Rome, where a number of monasteries were built in the Middle Ages. It
has known very little urban development since, and today, it’s a unique
island of quiet, where small restaurants and a few hotels are surrounded
by greenery and peaceful streets. It is well connected through public
transportation to all other destinations in Rome.
Campo de’ Fiori
Along the left bank of the Tiber, this authentic neighborhood is mostly
residential but is made very lively by the market square and the con-
nected commercial strip of Via dei Giubbonari. Here, you’ll find plenty
of restaurants and an active nightlife. Among the attractions is the beau-
tiful Palazzo Farnese.
Colosseo
The Colosseum was at the heart of ancient Rome, and the area around it
is a romantic mix of residential buildings and ruins. The Colosseo is
home to the most illustrious monuments of ancient Rome, including 
the Palatino; the Roman Forum; the Campidoglio; and, of course, the
Colosseum itself. To the north, in an area sloping up along Via Cavour, 
is a very authentic residential neighborhood. Although not elegant, it is
experiencing new life with the opening of trendy restaurants, small
hotels, and bars. To the east is another small, typically Roman neighbor-
hood, with a few hotels and some nice neighborhood restaurants.
Navona/Pantheon
On the southwestern side of the Corso, this lively neighborhood is a mix
of elegant Renaissance and medieval buildings, including the beautiful
palaces that house the government and the two chambers of the Italian
Parliament (the Parlamento and Senato). Many hotels occupy this area,
and several nice restaurants and bars can be found along Via del
Part III: Settling into Rome 
80

Governo Vecchio. Some of Rome’s best antiques shops line the Via 
dei Coronari. Graced by two of Rome’s greatest attractions — Piazza
Navona and the Pantheon — at its heart, this is one of the most desir-
able areas to stay; its popularity means that you have to put up with
crowds, especially in summer.
Piazza del Popolo
Squeezed between the old city walls and the river, around one of the
most beautiful squares in Rome, this lively neighborhood has a lot of
trendy new restaurants and bars in the area extending west of the Corso.
Piazza di Spagna
On the east side of the Corso, this former residential neighborhood has
been almost completely taken over by the fashion and tourist industries.
It is the best shopping neighborhood in Rome, home to all the great
names of Italian couture, plus a lot of other tony shops. It has many
hotels, including some of the city’s best. The shopping streets get a bit
deserted at night, and if you’re seeking some nightlife, you have to edge
toward Fontana di Trevi or cross over the Corso.
Prati
This residential neighborhood on the western bank of the Tiber takes its
name from the fields (prati) that survived here through the end of the
19th century. It stretches north of the Vatican along the river. Reflecting
its late-19th-century origin, the tree-lined streets are wide and straight.
The area is pleasant and only a bridge away from Piazza del Popolo; it
has a relatively active, if subdued, nightlife, with restaurants, jazz clubs,
and an important shopping area along Via Cola di Rienzo.
Repubblica
Piazza della Repubblica is a gorgeous square created over what was the
main hall of Diocletian’s thermal baths, a few steps west of Piazza dei
Cinquecento and the Termini train station. The areas along Via Cernaia
on one side of the square and Via Nazionale on the other are lively during
the day because of the numerous shops and offices, but not particularly
happening at night, when it turns into a quiet residential neighborhood
with a few hotels and restaurants. Very convenient to most of Rome’s
attractions and very well connected by public transportation, this is a
good alternative to the more glamorous and pricey areas nearby.
San Pietro
On the western bank of the Tiber, this area is mainly occupied by the
walled city of the Vatican (seat of the Holy See and site of the Vatican
Museums and the Sistine Chapel). It is dominated, of course, by the
grandiose St. Peter’s Basilica and Castel Sant’Angelo. Flanking the basil-
ica are two ancient and picturesque residential neighborhoods that are
home to a few hotels and restaurants.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 81

Teatro Marcello
This area covers what is still commonly referred to as the Ghetto, the
old Jewish neighborhood at the edge of ancient Rome. It is among the
most authentic of the historical neighborhoods and remains very resi-
dential. Some nice restaurants are tucked away in its small streets, along
with pubs, local shops, and a few archaeological treasures.
Trastevere
Located on the western bank of the Tiber at the foot of the Gianicolo
hill, this neighborhood is just across the river from the Aventino.
Literally “on the other side of the Tiber,” this was the traditional (and
rather seedy) residence of poorer artisans and workers during ancient
Roman times. Its character was preserved during the Middle Ages and
the Renaissance, and to some extent up to the last century. In recent
times, though, it has been largely transformed into an artsy, cultured
neighborhood, famous for its restaurants, street life, and nightlife,
appealing to younger and not-so-young Romans and visitors.
Trevi
On the east side of the Corso, this neighborhood slopes up the Quirinale
hill with the magnificent Renaissance presidential (formerly papal) resi-
dence as its centerpiece. Aside from the tourist hubbub around its
famous fountain — always surrounded by a sea of humanity — it’s a rela-
tively unspoiled neighborhood with many small restaurants and shops.
Via Veneto
Made famous by Fellini as the heart of La Dolce Vita, this elegant street
is lined by famous hotels and a few upscale stores. The environs are
very quiet at night; they have a number of nice hotels in the side streets
but relatively few restaurants and nightspots. Well connected by public
transportation, the areas behind the glitzy strip of Via Veneto are actu-
ally a good alternative to the glamorous and expensive areas nearby,
especially if you go toward Via XX Settembre (at the southeastern edge
of this neighborhood).
Finding Information after You Arrive
The Visitor Centre, Via Parigi 5, off Piazza della Repubblica (% 06-488991;
www.romaturismo.it; Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–7 p.m.), offers plenty of literature
on Rome and on side trips from the city, plus a free map and a monthly
calendar of events. You’ll also find a tourist information desk at the 
international arrivals section of Terminal B at Fiumicino Airport (% 06-
65956074; daily 8 a.m.–7 p.m.). Tourist info points dot the city near major
attractions (daily 9 a.m.–6 p.m.).

 Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Via Nazionale (% 06-47824525; Bus: 64)
Staff members at the info points in and near Termini station are usually
the most overwhelmed; elsewhere, you’ll find people more available to
assist you.
The Holy See maintains its own tourist office. It is in Piazza San Pietro
(% 06-69884466; Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.), just left of the entrance to
St. Peter’s Basilica. The office has information on the Vatican and on its
tourist attractions and religious events. You may also make reservations
for a visit to the Vatican gardens or fill out the form to participate in a
papal audience — but we recommend that you make a reservation
before you leave home (see “How to Attend a Papal Audience” in
Chapter 11 for more information).
Getting Around Rome
Rome’s historic hills are no myth: They are real — and sometimes even
steep. The one myth is that there are only seven of them. Rome may
look flat on a map, but it’s very hilly. You’ll soon understand why locals
use mopeds (or cars, unfortunately) and public transportation, and why
you see so few bicycles around. Remember also that the city is thou-
sands of years old, meaning that much of it isn’t designed for any mode
of conveyance other than the human foot. There are times, however,
when you’ll welcome public transportation. Taxis, for example, are a
great convenience when crossing large sections of the city.

Part III: Settling into Rome 
84
By subway (metro)
Although the Metropolitana, or metro for short, has only two lines (work
has just started on the third line, which is not close to completion), it is
the best way to get around because the underground routes don’t suffer
from the terrible city traffic. In addition, the routes stay the same —
unlike the city bus system, which is under constant reorganization. 
Line A Battistini–Anagnina and Line B Laurentina–Rebibbia cross at
Termini station. A big red M marks all metro entrances. The metro runs
Sunday through Friday from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Saturday from
5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The Colosseum, Circus Maximus, and Cavour stops on Line B don’t offer
full elevator/lift service and aren’t accessible to travelers with disabili-
ties. (For tips for travelers with disabilities, see Chapter 6.)
Part III: Settling into Rome 

By bus and tram
Rome’s bus system is large and under continuous improvement, yet the
city’s ancient layout resists modernization, so things don’t always go
smoothly. Buses are very crowded at rush hour, and traffic jams are
endemic. Still, buses remain excellent resources because they go
absolutely everywhere in Rome. The diminutive electric buses (116 and
116T from the Gianicolo hill to Villa Borghese; 117 from Piazza del
Popolo to San Giovanni in Laterano; 118 from Piazzale Ostiense to Appia
Antica; and 119 from Piazza del Popolo to Largo Argentina) are the only
vehicles allowed on the tiny, narrow streets of the historic heart of the
city. Among the other bus lines, those that you are most likely to use are
the 23 (Prati to Aventino), 62 (Castel Sant’Angelo to Repubblica), 64
(Termini to Vatican), 87 (Prati to Colosseum), 492 (Tiburtina railroad
station to Vatican Museums), and 910 (Termini to Villa Borghese). Rome
also has a few tram lines; they aren’t as spectacular as the cable cars 
in San Francisco, but they’re fun to ride. A line we like a lot is the 3,
which passes by the Basilica di San Giovanni and the Colosseum.
Another line that you’re likely to use is number 8, from Largo Argentina
to Trastevere. Most buses run daily from 5:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m., but
some stop at 8.30 p.m. A few night lines are marked with an N for not-
turno (night); they usually run every hour, leaving the ends of the line 
on the hour.
On foot
Walking is by far the best way to experience Rome, because you see the
most as you wander the curving streets that merge, narrow to almost
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85
Getting a ticket to ride
ATAC (% 800-431784 or 06-46952027; www.atac.roma.it), Rome’s transport
authority, runs all public transportation in the city. The same ticket is valid for all serv-
ices. You need to buy tickets before boarding (although a few bus lines have on-board
vending machines, do not count on finding one), and you must stamp them upon board-
ing or they aren’t valid. On subway and trains, the stamping machines — little yellow
boxes — are at the entrance gates; on buses and trams, they’re on board. A regular
biglietto (ticket) for the bus or metro is valid for 75 minutes and costs 1€ ($1.30). Within
the 75 minutes of validity, you can take as many buses and trams as you want, but only
one subway ride. You can also get a day pass, or BIG, which costs 4€ ($5); a three-day
ticket, or BTI, for 11€ ($14); or a weekly pass, or CIS, for 16€ ($21). All passes give you
unlimited rides on bus, metro, and urban trains. You can buy tickets and passes at
metro ticket booths, the ATAC bus information booth in front of Stazione Termini (near
Platform C), from vending machines at some major bus stops, and at many bars, tobac-
conists (look for a TABACCHI sign or a white T on a black background), and newsstands.
The Roma Pass (see Chapter 11) includes a public transportation pass.

shoulder width, change names, and meander among beautiful old build-
ings. Wear very comfortable shoes, and be ready to switch to another
form of transportation — which will usually be handy — should you 
get tired.
To enjoy Rome’s delightful labyrinth, you need a good map. The free
tourist-office map is quite good, but it doesn’t have a stradario (street
directory), which is essential for locating addresses. You can buy a
detailed map with a stradario at any newsstand and many bookstores.
By taxi
Taxi rates are reasonable, but the fare can add up during busy times of
day when you’re stuck in traffic. They’re a great resource for getting to
your hotel from the train station and traveling around at night after the
buses and metro stop running.
Taxis don’t cruise the streets, as in most U.S. cities; they return to taxi
stands and wait for a call. That means you usually cannot hail a taxi on
the street unless you happen to find one returning to a stand. You’ll find
many taxi stands, especially near major landmarks, including Piazza
Barberini (at the foot of Via Veneto), Piazza San Silvestro, and Piazza
SS. Apostoli (both not far from the Trevi Fountain). You can identify taxi
stands by a smallish telephone on a pole marked TAXI. If you’re starting
from a place with a phone — a hotel or restaurant, say — asking the 
staff to call a taxi for you is easiest. For a 24-hour radio taxi, call % 06-
88177, 06-6645, or 06-4994.
By motor scooter (motorino)
Most Romans travel on mopeds, or so it seems when you’re on a street
corner waiting for the signal to turn green. If you have some two-wheel
experience — Rome is most definitely not the place to learn how to oper-
ate a scooter — the best spot to rent a motorino is Treno e Scooter (TeS)
on Via Marsala, just outside Termini station by the taxi stand and metro
entrance (% 06-48905823). TeS gives you a 10 percent discount if

Taxi fares in Rome
The meter starts at 2.33€ ($3). It adds 1.29€ ($1.70) for every kilometer (2⁄3 mile) if you’re
moving at up to 20kmph (12 mph), and for every 85.3m (280 ft.) if you are going faster;
this rate decreases within the urban limits (G.R.A. highway) to 0.78€ ($1) for every kilo-
meter (2⁄3 mile) if you’re moving at up to 20kmph (12 mph); for every 141m (462 feet) 
if you are going faster; and for every 19.2 seconds if you’re stuck in traffic. At night 
(10 p.m.–7 a.m.) you’ll have to pay a surcharge of 2.58€ ($3.40); on Sundays and holi-
days, it’s 1.03€ ($1.30). The luggage supplement is 1.04€ ($1.30) for each bag larger
than 35 × 25 × 50cm (14 × 9.8 × 20 inches).

you’ve traveled by train that day. The scooters are very good quality,
and the prices (for example, 52€/$68 for the weekend) include insur-
ance, taxes, and a free map; TeS also rents bicycles. To get there, take
the metro to Termini. Rent a Scooter Borgo, Via delle Grazie 2, off Via di
Porta Angelica, on the right side of the Vatican (% 06-6877239; Metro:
Ottaviano), and New Scooter, Via Quattro Novembre 96, up from Piazza
Venezia (% 06-6790300; Bus: 64), are also good options. You can get a
complete list from one of the tourist information points.
Riding a scooter can be dangerous in Rome’s busiest areas. Accidents
are increasingly common, and scooters are pretty flimsy compared with
cars. However, it’s a great way to travel on Sundays and holidays, when
car and bus traffic is light, or to explore quiet neighborhoods.

T
ravelers may gladly experiment with new tastes and flavors for their
food, but when it comes to sleeping, they want familiar creature com-
forts. Sometimes even the slightest variation from what they are used to
will lead to sleepless nights. In this chapter, we share with you not only
our list of favorite hotels, but also our best tips on what to expect, how to
tackle the inevitable cultural differences, and how to choose among a
wide and, in some cases, unfamiliar variety of lodging possibilities.
Knowing Your Roman Hotels: What to Expect
Destination of some 20 million tourists every year and with literally
thousands of years of hospitality experience, Rome offers a huge choice
of accommodations, not only in numbers but also in type and quality.
Some hotels have been in business for several centuries; others are
brand new. Some are family-run; others belong to international chains.
Some are mom-and-pop places; others are the haunts of jet setters.
You’ll find anything from very basic to supremely elegant, and from great
value to rip-off.
The hotel industry in Rome has made enormous progress toward stan-
dardization and upgrading older and historical lodgings to bring them in
line with the expectations of international travelers. Persistent cultural
differences, which are hard to iron out, become more and more apparent
as you go down the luxury scale. Your room in a top five-star hotel in
Rome will be basically the same, except in its décor, as another top five-
star hotel room elsewhere in the world. You’ll have space, top-notch
service, and state-of-the-art amenities, plus, of course, Italian style and
design in every single detail.

Some things are hard to come by in Rome, whatever the price: a pretty
view, lots of light, quiet nights, and plenty of space. Because medieval
and Renaissance buildings were not designed with our modern lifestyle
in mind, rooms tend to be smaller than you may expect. Also, the
medieval and Renaissance streets in the historic district are narrow, and
buildings were built literally on top of each other, with only darkish
inner courtyards in between in the best of cases. Having a view is rare,
and a real treat when you can have it without street noise. Most hotels
may have one or two rooms with a decent view, if at all. If this feature is
important to you, you will have to search far and wide and be ready to
pay for it. Brightness is a similar issue: it isn’t very common, though it is
easier to come by than a view. We specify which hotels have brighter
rooms than others, but of course, much depends on the room you are
allotted. Again, if this is important to you, you will have to make some
compromises, either on location or price. Similarly, if you want quiet,
you’ll have to pay more or give up being in the heart of the historic dis-
trict, especially in summer, when street life becomes ubiquitous. Space,
by contrast, is easier to come by: You only need to pay for it.
One interesting feature of Roman hotels is that as you go down in price,
rooms become less standardized. Within the same hotel and the same
price range — something we fail to understand — some rooms are great
while others are dumps. In our experience, hotels usually give out their
worst rooms only when they are overbooked, but we have seen some
haphazard room allotment in our years on the road. Space is usually 
the first thing to go. Bathrooms are especially tiny — before they were
added, relatively recently, it used to be common to have shared bath-
rooms in hotels. Elevators are rare and often broom-closet-size — or
totally absent, in the cheaper hotels — and often start from one level
above street level. Floors are a consideration, too: marble, tiles, and
hardwood used to be more common than carpeting, but in cheaper
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 91
Rome’s “architectural barriers”
Steps are ubiquitous in Roman hotels and may be particularly difficult to tackle when
you are loaded with luggage. The street level of Renaissance and baroque palazzi was
not a living floor (imagine the stench), and the main stairwell usually started from an
internal alcove or courtyard well away from the road. Even in the most expensive
hotels, a short flight of steps to reach the lobby from the street is common, and the
elevator often lies another few steps along. Some hotels provide ramps for wheelchair
accessibility, but that is far from the rule, particularly because space is so tight.
Elevators have commonly been constructed inside the stairwell enclosed by the 
staircases — the only space available — which is why they often can’t be accessed
from curbside and why, in smaller hotels, they are minuscule. If steps are a problem
for you, make sure you inquire about how many you must negotiate to reach the lobby
and the elevator before you make your reservation.

hotels we feel that it is better to stay away from carpeting, because it is
difficult to clean and is replaced less often than in upscale places. Just
remember to bring your slippers in the cooler months if you don’t want
to get cold feet! More expensive hotels usually provide slippers, but then
usually you have carpeting there as well.
Then there are amenities: Some that are commonplace in the United
States — big ice machines, for instance — are virtually unknown in Italy.
Of course, you can always step out of your hotel and sit on the terrace 
of a nearby cafe to have that iced drink. Other amenities, such as air-
conditioning and satellite TV, are now more the rule than the exception,
although you may have to pay extra in smaller and cheaper hotels (we
spell this out in our write-ups). By the way, regular TVs are standard
except in the cheapest accommodations, but they don’t offer English-
language programs. Then again, you didn’t go to Italy to watch TV, did
you? Window soundproofing is commonplace — and in the older
palazzo, the thickness of the old walls helps protect you from noisy
neighbors and the roar of traffic. Street noise is a problem that sound-
proofed windows cannot eliminate if you like to sleep with your window
open, though. If that is the case, ask for an inner room when you do your
booking. Hair dryers are routine only in pricier lodgings, but you can ask
and most often obtain one from the desk in cheaper accommodations.
Irons are rarely offered, but you can ask for laundry or ironing service at
most hotels, even in the lower price ranges. All hotel lobbies and break-
fast rooms are smoke free by law, but smoking is allowed in private
rooms; make sure to specify whether you want a smoke-free room when
you make your reservation.
Children’s amenities deserve special mention: They are basically nonex-
istent. The hotels we mark with our Kid Friendly icon have proven par-
ticularly ready to accommodate the special needs of those with small
children, or they just have a favorable set-up (with family or connected
rooms, for instance). See Chapter 6 for more on this subject. All hotels
should be able to provide you with a cot or extra bed upon request;
make sure you ask when you make your reservation.
Local breakfast is different from our American one: Romans will have
croissants, toast and jam, cereal, and fruit along with their coffee or tea,
and this is the “continental” breakfast usually included in your room rate.
Although an increasing number of middle-range hotels offer a buffet break-
fast with yogurt, cheese, and cold cuts, only the most expensive hotels
routinely serve eggs and hot dishes. In some hotels you can order — and
pay extra for — eggs and bacon if they aren’t on the spread; make sure
you ask when you make your reservation, if this is important to you.
One last thing: Remember that most hotels in Rome are private busi-
nesses, usually family operations (even if they belong to a group, it is
usually only a hotel association that fixes standards or simply allows
some economies of scale when purchasing supplies). As a result, man-
agement takes a lot of pride in its product and will be eager to make
Part III: Settling into Rome 
92

your stay comfortable. Just mention your difficulties; it is our experi-
ence that management will try to accommodate your request, if it’s at 
all possible.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
Prices have risen sharply in recent years. The weak dollar and poor
exchange rate haven’t helped. Rome is a capital city, and capital cities
the world over are expensive. Also, you cannot count on off-season rates
anymore: Off season in Rome has shrunk to a few weeks in January,
February, August, and November (see Chapter 3 for more on seasons).
The rest of the time you will find it difficult to get a decent room without
paying through the nose. The best moderately priced hotels in the his-
toric district sell out fast (sometimes they are booked as far as a year
ahead). The best way to get a good deal is to plan in advance.
Finding the best rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel can charge for a room. That’s
the rate you get if you walk in off the street at the peak of high season
and ask for a room for the night when the hotel is almost full. You see
these rates printed on the fire/emergency-exit diagrams posted on the
back of your hotel-room door. Chains are happy to charge you the rack
rate, but you can almost always do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid
paying the rack rate is surprisingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or dis-
counted rate. You may be pleasantly surprised. Also, a travel agent may
be able to negotiate a better price than you can get by yourself — but
usually only with hotels that belong to a chain. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.) Exploring package tours, which offer both air-
fare and hotel at a discount, is also worthwhile. (See Chapter 5 for more
on this.)
With hotel chains, reserving a room through the central reservation toll-
free number may result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On
the other hand, the central reservation number may not know about dis-
counted rates for special events at specific locations. Your best bet is to
call both the local number and the toll-free number, and see which one
gives you a better deal.
On the other hand, in Rome, where most middle-range hotels don’t
belong to chains, you’ll rarely be charged the rack rate. As a general
rule, private hotels in Rome will give you their lowest price when you
make your reservation directly instead of through an agent or a booking
service. This is because room rates change with the season and with
occupancy: If a hotel is half-empty, you’ll likely get a better rate than if it
has only one room available — but the rates management agrees on with
agents are based on seasons, not occupancy, and therefore tend to be
higher. Also, the hotel has to factor in the agent’s fee, which is then
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 93

reported on your room rate. Hence, booking directly — often through
the hotel’s Web site — is a good option in Rome.
Also, keep an eye out for specials: Most hotels in Rome offer deals for spe-
cial events, such as Easter, the big retail sales in January, or major art
exhibitions (see Chapter 3 for a calendar of events). They may also offer a
special rate for a two- or three-night stay and sometimes a weekend rate.
Always ask if there are any specials when you make your reservation.
Also, always check the hotel’s Web site — it often offers special Internet
deals (see “Surfing the Web for hotel deals,” later in this chapter).
Finally, if you’re Irish or British, be sure to mention membership in any
automobile clubs, which may have reciprocity with Automobil Club
d’Italia or the Touring Club Italiano; you may get a 10 percent discount.
Frequent-flier programs with Alitalia and some other European carriers
also may get you some points. Unfortunately, U.S. associations such as
AARP and AAA usually have nothing to do with private Italian busi-
nesses. Some international chains do offer discounts for these associa-
tions, so be sure to know if your hotel belongs to a chain.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: through
the hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking agency 
(or a fare-service agency such as Priceline.com). Booking through the
hotel’s own Web site is definitely the way to go in Rome for private
establishments: Many offer special online rates, while some also offer
significant discounts for advance booking, provided that you also pay in
advance. Another method is to narrow your options through one of the
Internet agencies listed later in this section and then check the Web site
of the hotel you selected directly. You’ll often find that you can do better
on the hotel’s site — the hotel doesn’t have to pay any agency fees.
Internet hotel agencies in mind-boggling numbers compete for the busi-
ness of millions of consumers surfing for accommodations around the
world. This competitiveness can be a boon to consumers who have the
patience and time to shop and compare the online sites for good deals —
but shop you must, because prices can vary considerably from site to
site. And keep in mind that hotels at the top of a site’s listings may be
there for no other reason than that they paid money to get the place-
ment. Among the many sites for Rome, we recommend Venere Net
(www.venere.com), which is very comprehensive and user friendly, as
well as Roma Hotels (www.roma-hotels.com), and the Cooperativa Il
Sogno (www.romeguide.it), both comprehensive and the latter with
good descriptions of the hotels (with pictures).
We don’t particularly recommend intercontinental agencies, which tend 
to list only a few hotels in Rome. Yet you can always try your luck with
hoteldiscount!com (www.180096hotel.com/cgi-bin/pickcity), 
Late Rooms.com (www.it.laterooms.com), and of course Expedia,
Travelocity, and, in the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
94

For both Priceline and Hotwire, you pay up front, and the fee is nonrefund-
able. Note: Some hotels don’t provide loyalty-program credits or points or
other frequent-stay amenities when you book a room through opaque
online services.
If you book your room through one of these online services, always get a
confirmation number, and make a printout of any online booking trans-
action in case your reservation is lost. Actually, after you’ve reserved
your rooms, it doesn’t hurt to contact your hotel directly and request a
confirmation via fax or e-mail to eliminate the chance of your arriving at
a hotel that has no record of your reservation. Make sure that you bring
the confirmation fax or e-mail with you to Italy.
Reserving the best room
First and foremost, make your reservations well ahead of time, espe-
cially if you decide to stay in a small hotel: The best rooms are the first
to go.
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in 
the house. The trick of asking for a corner room doesn’t always work in
Rome (usually, corner rooms are larger, quieter, and have more windows
and light than standard rooms, without necessarily costing more, but in
Rome’s historical buildings, corner rooms may actually be smaller and
darker). It is best to ask directly for what you need the most: quiet (away
from the main road and the elevator), light (with more windows), the
most spacious bathroom, and so on. Consider that to have it all you may
need to move to a higher price range. Always ask if the hotel is renovat-
ing; if it is, book elsewhere, or request a room away from the renovation
work. Inquire, too, about the location of restaurants and bars in the
hotel or outside — all sources of annoying noise. And if you aren’t happy
with your room when you arrive, talk to the front desk. If the hotel has
another room, it should be happy to accommodate you, within reason.
Finding Alternative Accommodations:
Apartments and Convents
Rome offers several accommodations options beyond hotels. If you plan
to stay for a week or more, you may want to consider renting an apart-
ment. Another option is to stay at one of the many convents and other
religious houses that rent rooms; they do allow couples, but the rooms,
though not quite monastic cells, don’t offer many frills. In this book, we
don’t list religious houses that accept guests, because they usually have
curfews (10 or 11 p.m., sometimes even earlier), and we don’t think that
you want to deal with that, especially if your trip is relatively short. If
you’re interested, however, the Cooperativa Il Sogno (www.romeguide.
it) is probably your best resource.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 95

If you want to rent an apartment, consult an organization that special-
izes in such arrangements. Vacation Rentals by Owner (www.vrbo.com)
lists hundreds of homes for rent. Each English-language listing contains
pictures, prices, and descriptions of the area where the house or apart-
ment is located. Usually, you deal directly with the owner, so you may
save considerably over the rate a broker would charge for the same
property.
B&Bs are also an option, but don’t expect romantic getaways: In Rome, a
B&B is often just a one-room operation in somebody’s home where you
also get breakfast. Most of the Italy-based Internet agencies maintain
apartment and B&B listings (see the section “Surfing the Web for hotel
deals,” earlier in this chapter). Other agencies to try are Hideaways
International (767 Islington St., Portsmouth, NH 03801; % 800-843-4433;
www.hideaways.com), At Home Abroad (405 E. 56th St., Suite 6H, New
York, NY 10022; % 212-421-9165), and Rentals in Italy (700 East Main
St., Ventura, CA 93001; % 800-726-6702 or 805-641-1650; www.rent
villas.com).
Arriving without a Reservation
If you arrive without a room reservation, your best option is to stop at
the hotel desk at the airport or in Termini station. Either will usually be
able to help you find something, but don’t expect great deals; those have
all been booked far in advance, and cancellations are rare. Be prepared
to find room only in the most expensive hotels or outside the historic
center, particularly at the height of the tourist season.
Rome’s Best Hotels
Following are our picks for our favorite hotels in Rome. We did not have
room for a full review of every one, so we list a few as runner-up options —
but they also have our full seal of approval. In selecting our favorite
hotels, we use cleanliness, comfort, and the most amenities at the best
prices as essential criteria. All the hotels we list in this section are con-
veniently located in the center of Rome, have private bathrooms, and
offer basic amenities. We always specify in the description if a hotel has
no elevator, satellite TV, or air-conditioning. In addition to giving you
exact prices, we use a system of dollar signs ($) to show a range of costs
for hotels (see Table 9-1). The dollar signs correspond to rack rates
(nondiscounted, standard rates) for a double room. If the hotel offers
triples, quads, or suites, we also give rack rates for those. To help you
further with the selection, we’ve created quick-reference indexes at the
end of this chapter that list all the hotels by neighborhood and by price
category.

Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 99
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels

A note about parking: Very few hotels in Rome have their own garage
or parking lot (when they do, we say so). Most often, they have an agree-
ment with a nearby facility (usually a narrow-entrance underground
garage). If you plan to bring a car — which we enthusiastically discour-
age (see Chapter 7) — ask your hotel for the rates when you book your
room, and expect to pay 18€ to 36€ ($23–$47) per day, depending on
location and car size.
In addition to our selections below, we also recommend some of the
international chains. Over the years, they have purchased a number of
highly desirable Roman hotels, such as the St. Regis Grand (a Starwood
property) and various Best Westerns.
Albergo del Senato
$$$$
Navona/Pantheon
This elegant hotel occupies an ideal location across from the Pantheon.
Guest rooms are spacious — the suites are palatial — and beautifully fur-
nished, with antiques and quality reproductions, marble-topped tables,
and hardwood floors. The marble bathrooms are huge (for Rome) and
nicely appointed. The terrace has a spectacular view and is perfect for
enjoying Rome’s sunsets. The building is wired for Wi-Fi.
See map p. 98. Piazza della Rotonda 73. % 06-6784343. Fax: 06-69940297. www.
albergodelsenato.it. Bus: 60, 175, 492 to the Corso; 116 to Pantheon. Rack
rates: 365€ ($438) double; 410€ ($492) triple; 440€ ($528) quad; suites 475€ ($570)
and up. AE, DC, MC, V.
Albergo Santa Chiara
$$$
Navona/Pantheon
Operated since 1838 by the Corteggiani family, this hotel offers great value.
It’s named after St. Clare, St. Francis’s spiritual sister, who lived her last
years in a room in this building. (That room has been transformed into a
chapel, which you can visit.) The hotel is only a few steps from the
Pantheon, with most attractions within easy reach. The service is usually
attentive, and employees are ready to answer all your needs. The guest
rooms are all different; some feature beamed ceilings, some are large, and
some are small. Our favorites are the three garret suites with private ter-
races. Some rooms have hardwood and others carpeted floors; bathrooms
are decent size and new.
See map p. 98. Via Santa Chiara 21. % 06-6872979. Fax: 06-6873144. www.albergo
santachiara.com. Bus: 40, 62, 63, and 64. Rack rates: 280€ ($364) double; 550€
($715) suite. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Casa Valdese
$
Prati
Located on the Vatican side of the river, near Castel Sant’Angelo and the
shopping district of Cola di Rienzo, this small hotel is a good deal. The
Part III: Settling into Rome 
100

name “Valdese” refers to the Protestant organization of Swiss origin that
manages the hotel, which reflects the society’s philosophy in its simple but
spotlessly clean and pleasant rooms. The very moderate prices and the
excellent location — basically across the river from Piazza del Popolo —
are other pluses. The hotel can also provide half-board (breakfast and
dinner) on request for 22€ ($29) per person per meal.
See map p. 98. Via A. Farnese 18, off Via Cola di Rienzo. % 06-3218222. Fax: 06-
3211843. www.casavaldeseroma.it. Metro: Lepanto. Via Farnese is the first right
as you walk toward the river on Via Giulio Cesare. Rack rates: 119€ ($155) double;
163€ ($212) triple; and 194€ ($252) quad. Rates include breakfast. AE, V.
City Hotel
$$
Piazza di Spagna/Via Veneto
This hotel is a good find. Located on the third floor of a nice palazzo (with
an elevator from street level), it offers comfortable, well-appointed rooms,
with classic furnishings and decent-size marble and tile bathrooms, all at
moderate prices. Nice woodwork and bright spaces add to the atmos-
phere. The furnishings are tasteful and the service excellent. It also has
the great advantage of a perfect location, within walking distance of the
Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain, and it is very well connected to
public transportation — a rare advantage in the historic district.
See map p. 98. Via Due Macelli 97. % 06-6784037. Fax: 06-6797972. Metro: Barberini;
then take the fifth right as you walk downhill on Via del Tritone: 230€ ($299) double;
250€ ($325) junior suite. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Grand Hotel Parco dei Principi
$$$$$
Villa Borghese
Abutting Villa Borghese, this luxurious hotel offers the best service in
Rome and — if you can afford it — the best accommodations for families
with young kids, particularly in the busy season. The swimming pool, the
garden, and the proximity of the Villa Borghese Park and its various attrac-
tions (including the Borghese Gallery and the zoo) make it heaven for the
younger set and their parents. The rooms are palatial (some are wheel-
chair accessible), with spacious marble-clad bathrooms and Wi-Fi. The
excellent restaurants and room service on the premises are good options
for meal planning. You’ll be away from the action and crowds of the his-
toric center, which will not suit everybody (you’ll need to travel by taxi or
cross the park on foot). On the good side, you’ll have beautiful views from
the hotel’s terrace, quiet nights (oh, so rare in Rome), and easy parking
(just unthinkable). Always check for Web specials, which may include the
swimming pool and parking (which otherwise cost, respectively, 60€/$78
and 25€/$33).

breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Chapter 9: Checking In at Rome’s Best Hotels 101

Hotel Alpi
$$
Repubblica
Housed in a Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) building, this family-run
hotel offers quiet accommodations in a somewhat less glamorous area of
the historic district, well served by public transportation and walking dis-
tance to many attractions and Termini train station. Guest rooms are
medium-size with hardwood or carpeted floors and nicely appointed
marble bathrooms (not huge, but not tiny either). Some are furnished in
classic and others in contemporary style; we prefer the latter, but it is a
matter of taste. Service is attentive and friendly, and children get some
extra small attentions in the room. The hotel’s kitchen is available for in-
room dining. There is Wi-Fi in public spaces.
See map p. 98. Via Castelfidardo 84a, off Piazza Indipendenza. % 06-4441235. Fax
06-4441257. www.hotelalpi.com. Bus: 492. Metro: Termini, then walk right on Via
Solferino to Piazza Indipendenza. Rack rates: 165€–185€ double ($228–$241). Rates
include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Arenula
$
Campo de’ Fiori
We feel this is the best budget hotel in Rome: It offers spacious, well-
appointed and spotlessly clean guest rooms in one of our favorite loca-
tions in the historic center, only steps from Campo de’ Fiori, within easy
reach of shopping, nightlife, and attractions. The drawback is that there is
no elevator, and the hotel starts on the second floor (a pretty spiral marble
staircase leads to the reception area). Guest rooms are simply furnished
but bright and tasteful, with basic amenities and decent-size bathrooms
and showers.
See map p. 98. Via Santa Maria de’ Calderari 47, off Via Arenula. % 06-6879454. Fax:
06-6896188. www.hotelarenula.com. Bus: 64, 70, 170, 492, 40 to Largo Argentina.
Walk south on Via Arenula, and take the fourth street on your left. Rack rates: 125€
double ($163). Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Art
$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
A postmodern creation in one of the most desirable areas of Rome, Hotel
Art is worth a visit even if you don’t get a room. Just go for a drink at the
bar — created in the columned and frescoed chapel of a palace — to see the
hall and the court, with its crystal staircase and designer-contemporary
furnishings. Striking features illustrate the artistic “eclecticism” on which
the hotel prides itself: public spaces and rooms are color coordinated down
to the stationery, one color per floor, while the furniture is made of fine
hardwoods. With the feel of boutique hotels you find in all the great cities
of the world, it accents comfort, service, and, of course, style. Check the
Web site for Internet specials. The hotel is wheelchair accessible.
See map p. 98. Via Margutta 56, next to Via del Babuino. % 06-328711. Fax: 06-
36003995. www.hotelart.it. Metro: Piazza di Spagna. Walk on Via del Babuino;
Part III: Settling into Rome 
102

take the first right and then the first left. Rack rates: 429€–495€ ($558–$644) double;
1,229€ ($1,598) suite. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Britannia
$$$
Repubblica
This pleasant, elegant hotel enjoys a good location in the historic center
and is convenient to most attractions and well served by public trans-
portation. Guest rooms are not huge but are smartly appointed with neo-
classic or modern furnishings and carpeted floors; some rooms have
private terraces equipped with table and chairs, while some have vaulted
ceilings and other architectural details. Each marble bathroom holds a tan-
ning lamp. The daily fresh fruit basket and welcome drink are good
touches from a professionally friendly and highly available staff.
See map p. 98. Via Napoli 64, off Via Nazionale. % 06-4883153. Fax: 06-4882343. www.
hotelbritannia.it. Metro: Repubblica. Walk 2 blocks on Via Nazionale, and turn
left. Rack rates: 240€ ($312) double. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC. MC, V.
Hotel Capo d’Africa
$$$$
Colosseo
This elegant modern hotel is located on an atmospheric street between
the Colosseum and San Giovanni, close to the Forum but not at the heart
of the historic district. Under the same ownership as the Hotel Dei Mellini
(see review later in this chapter) and known for its excellent service, the
Capo d’Africa offers comfortable, spacious rooms furnished in a warm,
modern-ethnic style, some with hardwood and other carpeted floors. The
marble bathrooms are good size and nicely fitted. The hotel also offers
some suites and wheelchair-accessible rooms. Don’t miss the roof terrace
and its splendid views.
See map p. 98. Via Capo d’Africa 54. % 06-772801. Fax: 06-77280801. www.hotel

to Via Capo d’Africa. Rack rates: 360€–400€ ($468–$520) double; suites 500€ ($650)
and up. Rates include buffet breakfast. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel Columbia
$$
Repubblica
This refined hotel offers excellent value; it’s in a somewhat less glamorous
area of the historic district, yet convenient to a number of attractions and
well connected by public transportation. The family that has managed the
property since 1900 is proud of the quality of its service. Guest rooms are
spacious and bright, many with beamed ceilings, some with arched win-
dows or Murano chandeliers. All rooms are individually furnished with
modern beds and antiques or quality reproductions. Bathrooms are good
size and modern. The hotel also has a pleasant roof garden with a bar,
where breakfast is served.

Hotel Dei Mellini
$$$
Prati
Within walking distance of Piazza del Popolo (across the bridge) and
Castel Sant’Angelo, and convenient to public transportation, this hotel
earns our vote with sophisticated atmosphere that doesn’t cost an arm
and leg. We also like its relaxing internal garden and the public areas deco-
rated with contemporary art. Guest rooms are large and elegantly fur-
nished in modern-classic style; some have private terraces. The good-size
bathrooms are pleasingly arranged and marble-clad. Children up to age 12
stay free in their parent’s room.

Hotel Farnese
$$$
Prati
Tucked behind Castel Sant’Angelo in a quiet neighborhood only steps from
one of Rome’s best shopping streets — Via Cola di Rienzo — and within
walking distance of the Vatican and Piazza del Popolo (across the Tiber),
this hospitable hotel occupies a 1906 patrician palazzo, which has 
been completely renovated. Quiet and off the tourist path, it is elegantly
decorated. The guest rooms are spacious — the largest are geared for 
families — with stylish hardwood floors and classic furnishings. The bath-
rooms are particularly nice, clad in marble and tile, spacious (for Rome),
and with new modern fixtures. The hotel also has a roof garden.

Hotel Hassler
$$$$$
Piazza di Spagna
If money is no object, this luxury hotel, with its fantastic location up the
Spanish Steps and its sophisticated elegance, is the place to be in Rome.
The basic double rooms are not as opulent and spacious as the deluxe
doubles, which are basically junior suites, but you enjoy the same top
amenities (including a state-of-the-art health center), and most have a
relaxing view over the inner garden. Bathrooms are wonderful, marble-clad
retreats. The hotel also offers bicycles to take to nearby Villa Borghese,
terraces where you can take in the view, and a number of bars and restau-
rants, including the recently opened Imago, serving creative Italian fare
on the roof, with Rome at your feet.

excellent prices (off-season prices can be half the rack rate). Rooms are
bright and spacious, with tiled floors and large beds. Some of the comfort-

A splendid location and moderate prices are the key characteristics of this
small family-run hotel, situated on the second floor (no elevator for the
first level) of a historic building within walking distance of the Spanish
Steps. Service is kind and attentive, and a 24-hour Internet point is avail-
able. The basic guest rooms and bathrooms are decent size and pleasantly
appointed, with tiled floors and simple, good-quality wood furnishings.

Hotel Santa Maria
$$
Trastevere
This small hotel occupies a block of low buildings surrounding a romantic
courtyard lined by a portico. Most of the guest rooms are on the first floor
and open directly on the courtyard (there’s one garret suite on the second
floor). Rooms are cozy and welcoming, with terracotta-tiled floors, white-
washed walls, and dark-wood furniture. They can be a bit dark on rainy days
because all natural light comes from the portico. The courtyard is a pleas-
ant place to take breakfast on a sunny morning. In the afternoon and early
evening, guests can have a glass of wine from the wine bar. The suites are on
two levels and are designed for families with children (up to six beds).

San Pietro
We love this hotel: it is a great find in this price range. Located in a charm-
ing, authentic neighborhood a stone’s throw from the Vatican, it is in a
16th-century building with an inner courtyard where breakfast is served in
nice weather. The rooms are large and have elegant modern furnishings,
carpeting, and good-size marble bathrooms; a number of rooms have cof-
fered ceilings. The vaulted breakfast room has bright fresco decorations.
The hotel is accessible to wheelchairs and allows pets.

Hotel Scalinata di Spagna
$$$
Piazza di Spagna
This is a charming small hotel just above the Spanish Steps near the ele-
gant Hotel Hassler (there is a public elevator from Piazza di Spagna if
you’re too tired to negotiate the tourist-clogged environs). The guest
rooms are smallish but cheery and nicely appointed in classic style; some
have exposed beams, and two have a private small terrace; most are car-
peted. The marble bathrooms are fair-size but not large by any means. The
suites are two connected rooms designed for families. The pleasant roof
garden offers a nice spot to unwind in the good season. Wi-Fi in the rooms
and an Internet point in the lobby are freely available to guests. The wel-
come fruit basket is a nice touch.

Hotel Teatro di Pompeo
$$
Campo de’ Fiori
Located in the lively, historic neighborhood near Campo de’ Fiori, this is
a good budget choice with plenty of charm. The name refers to the ancient
Roman theater, dating from 55 B.C., that lies beneath the hotel; some of its
structure is visible in the breakfast room. The rest of the building is much
newer — that is, from the 15th century — as you see by the beamed ceil-
ings in some rooms. The rooms are spacious for this ancient area of Rome,
and the white plaster walls, hardwood floors, and simple furnishings give
it an old-fashioned charm. The tiled bathrooms are not large but have new
fixtures. We do not recommend the three rooms in the nearby annex,
which are small and located on the third floor with no elevator.

Navona/Pantheon
We like this hotel’s romantic location — hidden in a narrow street behind
Piazza Navona — and atmospheric lodgings. It’s in a 17th-century palazzo,
with a grand baroque marble staircase to the main lobby (the only way
up, but hotel personnel will help with your bags), 10-foot-thick walls, and
charming rooftop terrace. Guest rooms, furnished with personality, have
hardwood floors, quality furniture, plenty of wooden ceiling beams, and
good-sized marble bathrooms. Every room has Internet access and a

Rose Garden Palace
$$$$
Via Veneto
This is one of our favorite hotels in the exclusive area around Via Veneto,
housed in a Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) building from the beginning
of the 20th century. The eponymous rose garden is a lovely inner retreat
that’s perfect for a private moment of relaxation. Charm isn’t the only thing
you’ll find here, however; the top-notch amenities include a fitness center
with a small swimming pool and gym. The marble bathrooms have both
showers and bathtubs; the rooms themselves are large; and the entire
hotel is furnished with very sleek yet inviting modern décor in wood and
fine materials. The American buffet breakfast is great.

yet only steps from attractions and transportation. Guest rooms are large
and elegantly decorated, with period furniture and delicate frescoes and
moldings on the walls. Good-size marble bathrooms add to the value. If

marble and mosaics. The small roof terrace, where breakfast is served in
good weather, enjoys gorgeous views over ancient Rome — as do the three
private terraces of the Pompeian suite. See map p. 98. Via dei Santissimi Quattro

Hotel Columbus
$$$
San Pietro
Housed in the 15th-century Palazzo della Rovere, literally 
steps away from St. Peter’s Square (the Della Rovere were an important aris-
tocratic family linked to the Vatican), this is a unique hotel. Decorated with
frescoes (some by Pinturicchio) and preserving the feeling of a dignified
aristocrat’s palace, it offers large and commodious rooms, some of which
are a bit tired. The service is particularly kind and attentive. La Veranda
restaurant (see Chapter 10) opens on the large and delightful inner garden
courtyard. The hotel is accessible to travelers with disabilities. See map

Making the lists of the world’s top hotels ever
since it opened in 2000, the de Russie is one of the most elegant place to
stay in Rome, along with the Hotel Hassler (see earlier in this chapter).
The location, service, and accommodations are superb. If you stay here,
you’ll follow the steps of the rich and famous — Bill and Chelsea Clinton,
among others. Housed in a beautiful palazzo enclosing a delightful terrace
garden, the hotel is furnished in extremely tasteful and classy contempo-
rary Italian style, and guest rooms have all kinds of amenities. You’ll also
find a spa with sauna, gym, and swimming pool. The restaurant on the
premises, Le Jardin du Russie (see Chapter 10), gets excellent reviews.

man behind Piazza del Popolo and the Pincio Gardens) at the beginning of
the 19th century, it is an atmospheric hotel. Guest rooms are not large, but

Dining and Snacking 
in Rome
In This Chapter
 Discovering Rome’s dining scene
 Tasting the best of Roman foods
 Seating yourself at Rome’s best restaurants
 Having memorable dining experiences
 Finding the best quick snack
I
t used to be said that there wasn’t a really good restaurant in Rome,
but things have changed, and the capital now counts among its many
treasures some of the best restaurants in the country.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
Rome’s dining scene has gone a long way in just over a decade. Once
home to a number of good but down-to-earth little trattorie offering tradi-
tional local food, interspersed with a few stuffy formal restaurants serv-
ing mediocre fare, the city now boasts hundreds of trendy eateries,
elegant restaurants, and welcoming joints of all descriptions, including
non-Italian spots. Osterie, trattorie, and pizzerie that specialize in tradi-
tional fare have multiplied even as they’ve become more careful about
food quality (see Chapter 2 for more on Roman specialties and cuisine).
The chefs at many traditional restaurants are purists, looking far and
wide for the best ingredients and techniques. Those serving innovative
cuisine have followed the same route, and, in general, you’ll notice
respect for ingredients’ quality everywhere. Also, as hotel dining has
become fashionable, more top hotels have hired world-renowned chefs,
making previously nondescript restaurants into real winners.
Restaurants crowd the historic center, with the highest concentration 
in the area around Campo de’ Fiori, in Trastevere, and in the Navona/
Pantheon and Trevi areas, in that order. A steady flow of locals — from
government offices and the numerous businesses in these areas, but
also from everywhere else in Rome — feeds constant renewal and

ensures good quality. Feel free to try one of the small restaurants in
these neighborhoods even if we don’t specifically recommend it: It
would be impossible to list all the good places in Rome. Just follow your
nose. In addition, some areas have emerged recently — in residential
neighborhoods such as Parioli, along Viale Liegi, and the little streets off
Via Nomentana, near Porta Pia. Experimenting with new restaurants in
these neighborhoods is always tricky: You certainly won’t have a bad
meal, but it may not be the best the city can offer.
Dining hours are later than in the United States. Romans sit down to
dinner between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.; lunch is between 1 and 3 p.m. A 
few restaurants in the historic district open around noon for lunch and
7:30 p.m. for dinner to accommodate tourists. Many pubs also open ear-
lier. Smoking is illegal in public places, but it’s allowed in separate
rooms in restaurants that provide them. The price of each dish often
includes a 10 percent to 15 percent charge for servizio (service) — if it’s
not specified on the menu, it is not included — but an extra 5 percent to
10 percent is expected for good service.
If you’re visiting in the summer, remember that Roman men tend to
dress in what may look rather formal to American eyes (no shorts, and
rarely jeans), even during the day. A man in shorts and a tank top may
not be able to have lunch except in the most informal eateries. Shorts
and tank tops (except really stylish and elegant ones) are not a good
choice for women, either, but they may pass more easily.
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
Thanks to Rome’s dining boom, it’s getting easier and easier to find nice
restaurants — but harder and harder to find really cheap ones that
serve high-quality food. However, a good meal in Rome remains very
affordable, and you don’t need to make big sacrifices to save a little.
A common strategy is to have a bite on the go at a bar or rosticceria for
lunch (see “Dining and Snacking on the Go,” later in this chapter) and
save your money for dinner. If you really want to save money, be pre-
pared to stand — bars apply a surcharge for sitting at a table (al tavolo)
rather than eating at the counter (al banco) — or take your food to a
bench in a public garden; in that case you can even buy your food at an
alimentari (a grocery store). In restaurants, you can easily spend less by
having fewer courses. The classic Roman meal includes appetizer, pasta,
secondo (meat or fish), contorno (salad, vegetables, or potatoes), and
dessert, with copious wine and an espresso to finish, but this kind of
meal — usually stretching for a couple of hours — is only for special
occasions and weekends. For lunch or a light dinner, most Romans eat a
secondo with a contorno, or even just a pasta dish with a contorno, or a
pizza (round; individual size).
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 113

Another thing to watch is drinks. A bottle of wine will considerably
increase your bill, but most restaurants offer vino della casa, sold by
volume (minimum un quarto — a quarter liter, or about 9 ounces), and
many have a few choices by the glass. What may surprise you is that
wine is often less expensive than soft drinks. If you’re a group or a
family, agree on one kind of soda and ask for a large bottle (liter size) —
it’s much cheaper than individual cans. Most pizzerie serve family-size
bottles of beer as well as soda. Cocktails are basically unknown except
at the most fashionable bars.
Rome’s Best Restaurants
We have reviewed what we feel are the best restaurants in Rome. Of
course, there are many more than we have room for here, but these are
our favorites, and we hope they’ll be yours. Each listing is marked with
dollar signs to give an idea of the cost of a full meal, including a pasta
dish or appetizer, a secondo (main course or entree), a side dish, and
dessert. Beverages are not included. Within the listings, the numbers we
give you are the price range for main courses, listed as secondi, and first
courses (antipasto or primo) are usually equally expensive or cheaper.
Here is a table explaining what the dollar signs translate to in cost:

At the end of this chapter, you’ll find indexes of all the restaurants we
recommend: by location, by cuisine, and by price. See the “Rome Dining
and Snacking” map in this chapter for the locations of all eateries we
review in this chapter.
Italy recently instituted one of Europe’s toughest laws against smoking
in public places. All restaurants and bars come under the ruling except
those with ventilated smoking rooms. Smokers face steep fines if caught
lighting up. Only 10 percent of restaurants have separate smoking areas.
A little remark on service: In Rome, good service is unobtrusive. That
may sound good, but it means that although nobody will rush you, you’ll
need to let the staff know when you want the menu, when you are ready
to order, when you are ready for your second course, and so on. In the
best restaurants, just raising your eyes summons your server in the
wink of an eye; elsewhere you’ll have to raise your hand.

ROMAN/FISH
A favorite with locals — both gourmets looking for creative dishes and
fans of traditional Roman cuisine — this restaurant has only one draw-
back: price. The quality, though, is outstanding. The chef claims he
invented the crudo (“raw” — as in raw fish), and he keeps researching new
flavors while respecting traditional dishes. The ever-changing menu may
list millefoglie con mousse di dentice in salsa al vino bianco (napoleon with
local fish mousse in white wine sauce) and classic zuppa di fagioli e frutti
di mare (bean and seafood stew) revisited by the chef. The tasting menus
are a good way to explore: They range from Roman tradition (50€/$64) to
the chef’s grand cuisine (84€/$110).

Colosseo
ROMAN/FISH/PIZZA
A local favorite, this stronghold of Roman cuisine may look like a tourist
trap because of its perfect location across from the Forum, but it is actu-
ally an authentic traditional restaurant. We definitely recommend the buca-
tini all’amatriciana, saltimbocca alla Romana (sautéed veal with ham and
sage), and — when on the menu — pollo alla Romana (chicken stewed
with red and yellow peppers). Fish dishes vary with market offerings
(check the display by the entrance door). The terrace is a great plus in
good weather, but service may get slow.
See map p. 116. Largo Corrado Ricci 40. % 06-6791121. Reservations recommended.
Metro: Colosseo. Secondi: 7€–18€ ($9–$23). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Wed–Mon
noon–3:15 p.m. and 7–11 p.m. Closed Jan.

ROMAN/CREATIVE ITALIAN/FISH
The chefs here are among those who’ve taken to the trend of enlivening
Roman cuisine with new combinations that Grandma never imagined.
Their experiments are subtle and delicious, and options include more tra-
ditional offerings, too. The maccheroni all’amatriciana (pasta in a spicy
tomato and bacon sauce) is excellent, but so are the less usual spaghetti
aglio olio e mazzancolle (spaghetti with garlic, olive oil, and local prawns),
tonno arrosto con melanzane (baked tuna with eggplant), and anatra in
salsa di frutta secca (duck in dried fruit sauce).
See map p. 116. Via G.G. Belli 59, off Via Cicerone, 1 block from Piazza Cavour. % 06-
3210992. Reservations recommended. Bus: 30, 70, 81. Secondi: 13€–21€ ($17–$27).
AE, DC, V. Open: Mon–Sat 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–10:30 p.m. Closed Aug.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 117

Ar Montarozzo
$$
Appian Way
ROMAN
This is where we come when we go for a stroll in the Appia Antica Park. We
like the old-fashioned atmosphere, which gives a feeling of bygone Rome.
The huge restaurant has several rooms and an outdoor area that fills with
local families delighting in their traditional weekend lunches. We are par-
tial to the bucatini all’amatriciana, and — if you like delicate and juicy

BOLOGNESE
Elegant and hip yet welcoming, this restaurant serves well-prepared food
at moderate prices in a nicely appointed dining room or, in good weather,
on the outdoor terrace. It is so popular that you’ll almost always need a
reservation. Even Romans admit that Bologna has produced some good
dishes, such the lasagna prepared so well here; tagliatelle alla Bolognese
(homemade pasta with tomato and meat sauce) and fritto di verdure e
agnello (tempura of vegetables and lamb tidbits) are mouthwatering. End
with something from the unusually large selection of delicious desserts.

true traditional recipes. On the extensive wine list, you’ll also find selec-

Ethnic and non-Italian dining
“When in Rome, do as the Romans do” goes the adage, and indeed, you’ll find that
Rome’s cosmopolitan population has mostly embraced the local culinary culture:
Ethnic restaurants are rare and often more expensive than others. The ubiquitous
Chinese restaurant — about one per neighborhood, and none to write home about —
costs about as much as the local trattoria or pizzeria. The others are fancy places
where Romans go for something special or exotic, with prices to match.
We love Japanese, and some of the city’s best is available at Hasekura (Via dei
Serpenti 27; % 06-483648; Mon–Sat 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.) and Hamasei (Via
della Mercede 35; % 06-6792134; Tues–Sun 12:30–2:30 p.m. and 7:30–11 p.m.). Also
serving Japanese, Doozo (Via Palermo 51; % 06-4815655; www.doozo.it; Tues–Sun
noon to 11 p.m.), is a sushi bar–cum–bookstore and art gallery, with a small Zen garden.
The best deal is the prix-fixe lunch for 12€ ($16). Our choices for Indian are the mod-
erately priced Il Guru (Via Cimarra 4; % 06-4744110; Mon–Sat 7:30–10:30 p.m.), the
north Indian Jaipur (Via San Francesco a Ripa 96; % 06-5803992; Tues–Sun 12:30–3

American cuisine at Baires (Corso Rinascimento 1; % 06-6861293; daily 12:30–2:30

a fast-food place is Oriental Express (Via Calatafimi 7; % 06-4818791; daily noon to

You’ll find more moderate prices among the Europeans: Bistrot d’Hubert (Via Sardegna

Rome, Charly’s Saucière (Via San Giovanni in Laterano 270; % 06-70495666; Tues–Fri

We come here, as generations of Romans have before us, for the warmth

classics. The restaurant is justly famous for beans — hence the name,
which translates as “the bean-eater” — prepared al fiasco (cooked inside
an old-fashioned wine bottle) or as a pasta soup. Our favorite pasta dish
is the spaghetti alla gricia, but many come for the carbonara (spaghetti with
egg and Italian bacon), trippa alla Romana (tripe), and coda alla vaccinara

Luxury dining in Rome’s top hotels
You may think of hotel dining as a last resort. Well, you may be missing a once-in-a-
lifetime experience. As the best hotels in Rome compete for Michelin stars and other
culinary titles, their restaurants have reached unprecedented heights and become
favorite destinations of gourmets in the know. One great place is Moscati in the Hotel
Mövenpick (Via Moscati 3, % 06-3051216; Mon–Sat 7:30–11 p.m.), where you can
enjoy a gourmet meal in luxury at moderate prices (the tasting menu costs 33€/$43);
it is particularly pleasant in good weather, when the panoramic terrace is open. The
seasonal menu covers surf and turf and may include spaghetti cacio e pepe con guan-
ciale di cinta senese (spaghetti with sheep’s-milk cheese and Sienese bacon) and
frittura di gamberi e porcini (deep-fried jumbo shrimp and porcini mushrooms). Do not
miss the desserts; we had a fantastic crème brûlée with Calvados. Another excellent,
more expensive choice is Ninfa in the Hotel Majestic (Via Vittorio Veneto 50; 
% 06-421441; daily 11:30–11 p.m.), where you can enjoy creative Italian cuisine all
day long. The changing menu may include salad of Mediterranean lobster with grilled
Roman artichokes, or homemade buckwheat tortelli with vegetables and pecorino di
fossa (sheep cheese aged in a dirt pit), and ricotta and grain soufflé with orange-
blossom water for dessert. We also like La Veranda in the Hotel Columbus (Borgo
Santo Spirito 73; % 06-6872973; www.laveranda.net; daily 12:30–3:15 p.m. and
7:30–11:15 p.m.), where you sit in the frescoed 15th-century loggia of the Palazzo della
Rovere, while savoring delectable creative Italian cuisine; the loggia opens on the
delightful inner garden, where you can dine in fine weather. We enjoyed the fettuc-
cine alla menta con amatriciana di tonno fresco (fresh mint pasta with fresh tuna
sauce) and tris di pesce alla griglia con salse (three different grilled fish filets served
with special sauces); you will find more innovative creations on the menu, and sim-
plified versions at lunch. The food is absolutely divine at Pauline Borghese in the
Grand Hotel Parco dei Principi (Via G. Frescobaldi 5; % 06-854421; www.parco
deiprincipi.com; daily 12:30–3 p.m. and 7:15–11 p.m.) where the homemade
bread comes hot out of the oven to your table, and the menu may include Parmesan
risotto with Parma prosciutto and asparagus, and calamari stuffed with burrata (a
creamy cheese from Campania and Apulia). The vegetarian menu costs 65€ ($85),
and the creative desserts are to die for. A close competitor is Vivendo at the St. Regis
Grand (Via Vittorio Emanuele Orlando 3; % 06-47092736; www.tasteinitaly.com;
Mon–Fri 12:30–2:30 p.m. and Mon–Sat 7:30–10:30 p.m.; closed Aug), a refuge of sub-
dued elegance and gourmet food at surprisingly moderate prices (tasting menus are
55€/$72 and 65€/$85). You’ll find homemade breads and an inventive menu based on
Italian ingredients, including such dishes as goose liver escalope with caramelized
peaches, and perfectly cooked herbed lamb with reduction of renetta apples and egg-
plant. The desserts are excellent, and the wine list includes numerous selections by
the glass. For a fascinating setting, head for Le Jardin du Russie at the Hotel de Russie

features many Tuscan specialties, but the steak is why you come here (be
prepared to share, because the real thing is about two pounds of meat —
a slice of cow, really — serving two hungry people). The nice choice of
good Tuscan wines is the perfect complement to the meat.

partial (try the fried ricotta). We also love the bucatini all’amatriciana,
saltimbocca alla Romana (savory tidbits of beef escalope rolled with Italian
bacon and sage), and coratella d’abbacchio (sautéed lamb organ meat).
The wine list includes a large selection by the glass.

We are always surprised to find that this restaurant only a few steps from
Piazza di Spagna has not become a tourist trap. Instead, this little place —
with a few tables outside in the good season — continues to draw locals
who come for the well-rounded menu of traditional Roman cuisine, as we
do. We recommend the specialty, coratella d’abbacchio con cipolla (sautéed
onions and lamb liver and organ meat).

This family-run restaurant — created by the sister of the famous Roman
actor Aldo Fabrizi and operated today by his son and grandsons — was
already a Roman institution, but with the recent renovations both in the
dining room and on the menu, it has won new admirers. The gnocchi are
superb, and complementing the solid traditional menu are many new
dishes, such as delicious polpettine al vino (small meatballs in a wine
sauce). Tasting menus and a vegetarian menu are available, and the tradi-
tional Roman contorni, such as cicoria (dandelion greens) and carciofi
(Roman artichokes), are exceptional.

larly with the season and market offerings, but it always includes local tra-
ditional dishes, such as filetto di baccalà (deep fried codfish filet), pasta

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 127

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Did you know that fast food was invented in Rome more than 2,000 years
ago? Street food was sold at carts and small shops in the Forum, and a
quick bite to eat could be had at any caupona (the ancient Roman word
for eatery), standing or perched on a high stool at the counter. You’ll see
many Romans still doing the same — having a sandwich standing up in a
bar or eating a square of pizza from a take-away rosticceria. Here is the
lowdown on Roman fast food.
Bars
Bars in Rome are sort of cafes that serve alcohol; they rarely have more
than a few seats and do most of their business at the counters (note that
there is a surcharge for sitting down). During the day, bars are Romans’
home away from home: They come for breakfast before work, espresso
and cornetto (sweet croissant, often filled with cream or jam) being the
typical fare; then again for coffee break, for lunch, and finally for aperi-
tivo (a predinner drink, with or without alcohol, accompanied by small
tidbits to eat) in the evening. For lunch, all bars prepare a large variety
of sandwiches, and some operate as small restaurants, offering prepared
hot dishes. Sandwiches include the rosetta (the typical Roman bread
roll), which can be filled with frittata (omelet), mozzarella and tomatoes,
or cheese and cold cuts; the tramezzino, or slices of crustless American-
style bread filled with a variety of mayo-based salads; and the pizza
Romana — our favorite — which is a square of focaccia filled with ham
and cheese, eaten cold or warm. Many bars also double as ice cream
parlors. For some of the trendiest bars, see Chapter 16, but any bar will
provide a basic, good-quality breakfast or lunch.
Wine bars (enoteche)
This typical Italian institution — the enoteca — also provides a good
alternative to stuffy restaurants for both lunch and dinner. The enoteca
is more of a wine shop than a bar, and this is why it is open regular shop-
ping hours, from morning to evening (including lunch). They’re also popu-
lar with the locals during dinner and after-dinner hours. Some strictly
sell wine; others also have a few tables and a counter where you can
sample the wine together with simple fare ranging from a choice of
cheese, cold cuts, and savory tidbits, to full-fledged hot gourmet dishes
at the most elegant joints. We review the best of them in Chapter 16.
Picnics
In fine weather, a nice, inexpensive option — and a favorite with 
children — is to buy sandwiches or pizza and picnic in one of Rome’s
great public parks, such as Villa Borghese or the Janiculum Hill (see
Chapter 11); even smaller neighborhood parks are a good choice.
Part III: Settling into Rome 
128

Keep in mind, however, that sitting on public fountains and monuments
to have your lunch is forbidden, and you’ll be asked to move. You may
even be heavily fined if you’re found littering.
For your supplies, try Fattoria la Parrina (Largo Toniolo 3, between
Piazza Navona and the Pantheon; % 06-68300111), which offers wonder-
ful organic cheese, wine, and veggies; L’Antico Forno di Piazza Trevi (Via
delle Muratte 8; % 06-6792866), where you’ll find superb focaccia and
bread, as well as a variety of other items; and the bakery — both savory
and sweet goods — Forno Food e Cafè, with several small shops around
the Pantheon (Via della Stelletta 2, % 06-99705346; Piazza della Rotonda
4, % 06-99705344; Via della Scrofa 33, % 06-68307505) and near Via
Boncompagni at Via Quintino Sella 8 (% 06-47822926). Any grocer
(including the deli counter at a supermarket) will prepare a sandwich with
the bread and cheese or cold cuts of your choice, all sold by weight.
Pizza a taglio
Pizza is a very good choice both for a quick and inexpensive meal and to
make children happy. The ubiquitous pizza parlors — a typical specimen
is a glass counter with ovens in the back — bake pizza all day long (usu-
ally Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–8 p.m.) in large, oblong, metal pans. Toppings range
from the simple rossa (tomato and oregano) and bianca (focaccia) to con
i funghi (mushrooms with tomato sauce or with cheese), con la moz-
zarella (tomato and mozzarella), con le patate (with thin slices of crispy
potatoes), and ripiena (filled with ham and cheese). Some fancier places
have a larger variety, but novelty is not necessarily a sign of quality; look
instead for steaming-hot pans, which mean constant turnover. (At the
best places, you’ll see Romans waiting for the next slab of their favorite
flavor to roll out.)
The best — and most convenient — are Pizza (Via del Leoncino 28; 
% 06-6867757), Pizza a Taglio (Via della Frezza 40; % 06-3227116),
Pizza (Via della Penna 14; % 06-7234596), Pizza Rustica (Via del Portico
d’Ottavia, % 06-6879262; and Via dei Pastini 116, % 06-6782468), Il
Tempio del Buongustaio (Piazza del Risorgimento 50; % 06-6833709),
Pizza Al Taglio (Via Cavour 307; % 06-6784042), and PizzaBuona (Corso
Vittorio Emanuele II 165; % 06-6893229). Pizza Forum (Via San Giovanni in
Laterano 34; % 06-7002515) is a sit-down pizzeria with very fast service.
Pizzerie
For a fast — and cheap — lunch or dinner without giving up on the
pleasure of sitting down at a table, Romans choose a pizzeria. These are
simple restaurants specializing in pizza — strictly individual-size, round
pizzas — and range from fancy (with tablecloths and fashionable dining
rooms) to more rustic (a piece of paper on a wooden table). They offer
pizza with a variety of established toppings, most of which have been
defined by name in a longstanding tradition, such as margherita (tomato
and mozzarella), napoletana (tomato, mozzarella, and anchovies), capric-
ciosa (tomato, mozzarella, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, olives, ham,
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 129

and an egg), and funghi (mushrooms, tomato, and mozzarella). You’ll also
find more modern and sometimes original combinations, such as rugola,
bresaola, e parmigiano (fresh arugula and thin slices of cured beef and
Parmesan cheese on simple tomato sauce), quattro formaggi (four kinds
of cheese), broccoletti e salsicce (broccoli rabe and sausage), and so on.
In addition, pizzerie typically serve a choice of savory and delicious
appetizers, such as bruschetta (toasted peasant-style bread topped with
oil and garlic and, on request, tomatoes, olives, ham, and so on), supplì
(deep-fried rice balls stuffed with a small piece of mozzarella), filetti di
baccalà (deep-fried salt cod), olive ascolane (deep-fried large green olives
stuffed with meat and cheese), and fiori di zucca (deep-fried zucchini
flowers stuffed with anchovy and mozzarella). If you like filetti di baccalà,
the best in Rome are at Filetti di Baccalà (Largo dei Librari 88, off Via dei
Giubbonari at Campo de’ Fiori; % 06-6864018; open Mon–Sat 7:30–
11 p.m.), a small restaurant where you can take out or sit down. It also
serves a few contorni and desserts, but the lines are epic.
For traditional Neapolitan-style pizza that has received the seal of honor
from the organization that guards the quality of Neapolitan pizza, try 
Al Forno della Soffitta 1 (Via Piave 62; % 06-42011164) and Al Forno
della Soffitta 2 (Via dei Villini, 1/f; % 06-4404642; closed Sun) or Pizza
Re (Via di Ripetta 14; % 06-3211468; closed Sun). The pizza is also
excellent at the elegant Il Regno di Napoli (Via Romagna 22; % 06-
4745025; closed Sat–Sun lunch only), which is also a full-scale restau-
rant and therefore a bit more expensive.
For Roman-style pizza (thinner than the Neapolitan version and less
bready, but more savory), try Baffetto (Via del Governo Vecchio 114; 
% 06-6861617); Ivo (Via di San Francesco a Ripa 158; % 06-5817082;
closed Tues); or Opera (Via del Leone 23; % 06-68809927), which offers
30 types of pizza.
Really good coffee
Even if you’re on the go, the proper way to finish a meal is with a good
coffee — at least that’s what Romans believe. Note, however, that many
smaller trattorie and pizzerias don’t make coffee. What better reason to
remove yourself to a famous coffee shop after your meal? If you’re a
coffee aficionado, you should not miss the Caffè Sant’Eustachio (Piazza
Sant’Eustachio 82, by the Pantheon; % 06-68802048; Bus: Minibus 116),
a traditional bar that has served Rome’s best espresso (made with water
still carried into the city on the ancient Roman aqueduct) since 1938.
Another excellent temple of coffee is Tazza d’Oro, also by the Pantheon
but on the other side (% 06-6789792; Bus: Minibus 116); you haven’t
lived until you’ve tried its granita di caffè (a concoction of frozen
espresso served with whipped cream).
Note: The coffee lingo in Rome is not what you are used to in the States.
The choices are espresso (your Italian coffee), caffe lungo (espresso with
a bit more water), caffe macchiato (espresso with a drop of foamy milk),
Part III: Settling into Rome 
130

caffe latte (a caffe lungo with milk; it’s what you would call a latte in the
U.S.), and cappuccino (a foamy espresso with milk).
Snack bars, tavola calda, and rosticcerie
These typical Roman fast-food eateries correspond to your local diner or
deli — if not in look and kind of food served, at least in purpose. This is
where you can have a simple lunch at a fraction of the price you would
pay in a restaurant, and where harassed working parents and singles
who don’t feel like cooking come for takeout in the evening. These
places present food behind glass counters and sell it by weight or by 
the piece. Sometimes they’re organized as cafeterias; others have only
standing room at a counter and are mostly takeout. A snack bar usually
has fewer offerings than a tavola calda, while rosticcerie focus on roasted
chickens and pizza, often with an array of side dishes. Some are better
than others: In the simplest snack bar you’ll find little more than sand-
wiches, while in the best tavola calda you’ll have an ample choice of
tasty and well-prepared hot and cold dishes, including pasta, secondi,
and contorni — in short, all you need for a full meal. Always look care-
fully at the food before ordering to be sure it isn’t dried out; in mediocre
places, you’ll be much worse off than at the local bar, where sandwiches
are usually freshly prepared. The clientele will also help you: Crowds at
mealtime (especially Romans) are an excellent sign.
Midway between a snack bar and a restaurant, Grillpoint (Piazzale di
Porta Pia 122; % 06-44236435; open daily noon to 2:30 p.m.) has an ele-
gant dining room and a wide choice of well-prepared dishes, including
pizza. Da Maciste al Salario, Pizza, Vino e Cucina (Via Salaria 179/a, at
Via Metauro; % 06-8848267; closed Mon dinner and Sun lunch) serves
excellent food cafeteria style and provides ample seating. There is a long
line for lunch; if you arrive late, the best items will be gone. The crowded
Taverna del Campo (Campo de’ Fiori 16; % 06-6874402) serves a large
variety of crostini, panini, and beer.
Sweet endings: Gelato
Italian ice cream (gelato) is among the best in the world. Serious gelato
comes in a variety of flavors and is priced by the size of the cone or cup.
It’s served with a special spatula and not by the scoop, so you can have
up to three flavors, even in the smallest size. Romans like to top it with
whipped cream, so you’ll be asked if you care for panna; our answer is
usually “Yes, plenty!” Flavors are frutta (fruit) — limone (lemon), arancio
(orange), melone (melon), pesca (peach), mora (blackberry), frutti di
bosco (mixed wild berries), the list is endless — and creme (creams).
Our favorite cream flavors are zabaglione (a rum-and-egg combo, remi-
niscent of eggnog), bacio (hazelnut chocolate), and stracciatella (vanilla
with chocolate chips), but even plain crema (egg cream) and cioccolato
(chocolate) can be fabulous when well prepared.
You’ll see prepackaged, commercial gelati for sale at every bar in town,
but why waste your time — and calories — with industrial ice cream
when you can have handmade gelato? Find a bar that says GELATERIA
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in Rome 131

outside and look for the sign PRODUZIONE PROPRIA: It means the place
makes its own ice cream, and it will be fresh and delicious.
Here are a few of the best (in our not-so-modest opinion) in Rome:
Giolitti (Via Uffici del Vicario 40; % 06-6991243; Minibus: 116), is the
oldest gelato parlor in Rome and is reliably excellent. The superb ice
cream at Il Gelato (Piazza Sant’Eustachio 47, near the Pantheon; no
phone yet), is made by a passion-driven young man who trained at
another famous Roman ice cream parlor, Il Gelatone (Via dei Serpenti
28, near the Colosseum; % 06-4820187). Pica (Via della Seggiola 12; 
% 06-68803275; Tram: 8), near Campo de’ Fiori is another good destina-
tion. Near Fontana di Trevi, head for Gelateria Cecere (Via del Lavatore
84; % 06-6792060; Bus: 116 or 492). In Trastevere, we love Gelateria
alla Scala (Via della Scala 5; % 06-5813174; Tram: 8), and in Prati,
Gelateria dei Gracchi (Via dei Gracchi 272; % 06-3216668; Metro:
Lepanto). Happy ice cream!

Part IV
Exploring Rome

In this part . . .
W
hether you’re an architecture buff, an amateur
archaeologist, an art aﬁcionado, a devout Catholic, 
or simply a lover of the world’s great cities, you’ll be delighted
with all that the Eternal City has to offer. In this part, we tell
you about Rome’s best attractions, both inside and outside
the city walls.
Rome is a veritable “who’s who” of famous monuments,
museums, and ruins, and we cover them all in Chapter 11,
along with tips on how best to enjoy them. And although
Rome isn’t as well known for fashion and shopping as some
other Italian cities, it has some fabulous shopping areas spe-
cializing in Roman- and Italian-made goods, which we tell you
about in Chapter 12. In Chapter 13, we’ve done some of your
planning ahead of time, putting together a choice of the ﬁve
best itineraries you can take, depending on your interests.
And although it has been said that even a lifetime is not enough
to visit Rome, in Chapter 14 we suggest ﬁve side trips — easy
excursions from Rome to unique destinations as absorbing as
the great city itself.

Chapter 11
Discovering Rome’s 
Best Attractions
In This Chapter
 Exploring Rome’s most famous attractions
 Enjoying the Vatican’s artistic riches
 Checking out other fun things to see and do
 Taking a guided tour
W
ith over 3,000 years of uninterrupted urban life, Rome boasts a
cultural density that’s difficult to match. Its historic center dis-
plays a unique layering of cultural periods and styles. Century after cen-
tury, Rome has attracted merchants, politicians, and artists from all over
Italy and Europe, starting at the time of the Roman Empire. The Catholic
Church, which ruled the city for almost a millennium, also played a cru-
cial role in the cultural shaping of Rome. The resulting melting pot has
laid the foundation for a cosmopolitan European culture of which Rome
was the heart for centuries, and in which it still plays a central role.
Indeed, the Eternal City may have an exalted history, but is no lifeless
museum of the past. Almost three million people live and five million
work in Rome, where the thoroughfares were designed for chariots
instead of cabs.
Moreover, this is an excellent time to be visiting: the Papal Jubilee in 2000
gave impetus to an ongoing stream of much-needed renovations to the
entire city, as well as efforts to reduce congestion and pollution. These
changes have already had a big impact on the city, and ever-increasing
numbers of appreciative tourists are pouring in. Come walking with
Romans on ruins from the days of Caesar, turning along the same alley-
ways trod by Lucrezia Borgia and the masters of the Renaissance, and
thrilling to the same lighted fountains that were reflected in the eyes of
Fellini’s beautiful debauchers, but don’t think you can do it all in a day:
Set aside several days to do this vibrant city right.

For a service fee of 1.50€ ($1.95), you can make reservations for a number
of attractions — and even buy your tickets online — by contacting
Pierreci (% 06-39967700; www.pierreci.it), the agency that manages
reservations for many Roman attractions. Pierreci e-mails you a voucher,
and you pick up your tickets at a special desk at the attraction entrance,
skipping the line. Pierreci’s hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to
1:30 p.m. and 2:30 to 5 p.m. The official agent for reservations and tickets
for other attractions — such as the Borghese Gallery — is Ticketeria
(% 06-32810; Fax: 06-32651329; www.ticketeria.it). Like Pierreci,
Ticketeria e-mails you a voucher, and you pick up your tickets at a special
location at the attraction entrance, thereby avoiding lines.
The Vatican is a separate state, with a visitor office that handles reserva-
tions for its attractions. In the Vatican Information Office (% 06-
69884466; Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7 p.m.), located under the colonnade to
the left of the entrance to St. Peter’s, you can get a small plan of the
basilica, make reservations for a tour of the Vatican Gardens, and pick
up complimentary tickets for attending the traditional Wednesday papal

Don’t pass up these deals
If you’re planning to do a lot of sightseeing in Rome, purchasing one of the discount
cards offered by various museums and attractions may just be the ticket.
The new three-day Roma Pass (% 06-82059127; www.romapass.it) is a worthy
bundle. For 20€ ($26) you get admission to two major attractions of your choice, dis-
counts on all others, and public transportation (bus, subway, and trains). Another ver-
sion also covers attractions outside the city within the province of Rome for 25€ ($33).
You can buy either version at any tourist info point and in all participating museums.
If you’re planning an extensive visit to the sites of ancient Rome, the best deal is the
seven-day Roma Archeologia Card. It costs 20€ ($26) and covers the Colosseum,
Palatine Hill, all the sites of the National Roman Museum (Octagonal Hall, Palazzo
Altemps, Palazzo Massimo, Terme di Diocleziano, and Cripta Balbi), Caracalla Baths,
and the two sites at the Park of the Appian Way that charge admission (Mausoleum
of Cecilia Metella and Villa of the Quintili). You can purchase the card at participating
sites (except for the Via Appia locations) and at the main Visitor Center of the Tourist
Board of Rome, Via Parigi 5 (% 06-36004399).
The complex of the Capitoline Museums also offers a combo ticket; it is valid for seven
days and includes admission to the Capitoline Museums and Tabularium, plus the
Centrale Montemartini (the postmodern annex created in a former power plant), for
8.50€ ($11), a savings of 6.50€ ($8.45).
Finally, the Appia Antica Card costs 6€ ($7.80) and gets you into the Caracalla Baths,
the Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella, and the Villa of the Quintili. The pass is valid for
seven days and available at all three sites.

audience. If your schedule is tight, we recommend you make some reser-
vations by fax before you leave (see listings for specific attractions).
It is a good idea to check attractions’ opening hours, which change
often, with the local tourist office before your visit (see Chapter 8 for
locations). Attractions’ opening hours may be extended, especially
during holidays and the summer months, and special night openings are
a treat not to be missed (the dramatic Roman ruins by night are just so
romantic . . .).
To fully appreciate the Roman Forum, the Colosseum, and other ruins,
pick up a copy of the small book Rome Past and Present, sold in book-
stores and at stands near the Forum for approximately 10€ ($13). Its
plastic overlays show you how Rome looked 2,000 years ago.
Rome’s Top Sights
Where do you begin? If you’re an archaeology buff, Rome’s ancient
sights can keep you going for days, weeks, months, and even years. But
the city is also loaded with famous museums, impressive monuments,
and awe-inspiring churches. In this treasure trove of possibilities, you
have to make some decisions. The sights in this section are our roster 
of the most important Roman attractions. For their locations, see the
“Rome Attractions” map on p. 142.
Rome’s attractions tend to be busy at any time of day, crowded with both
foreign and local visitors (see Chapter 3 for tips on when to go). If you
want to avoid throngs of people, plan your visits for the early morning
(before 9:30 a.m.), lunchtime (1–3:30 p.m.), and evening (after 7:30 p.m.);
midmorning and midafternoon are the peak visiting hours you should
avoid. Remember that as a rule, ticket booths close half an hour to an
hour before the stated closing time of a given attraction.
Borghese Gallery (Galleria Borghese)
Parioli
This is a very special gallery, created in 1613 by Cardinal Scipione
Borghese inside the Villa Borghese (a large park that’s now public; see
“Finding More Cool Things to See and Do,” later in this chapter). The car-
dinal wanted the splendid building to house his unique art collection and
display it to his special guests. Closed for restoration for 13 years, the
building and site are now an attraction in themselves; the art inside is
probably the most stunning smaller collection on view in Italy. The ground
floor focuses on sculpture, including Canova’s sensual reclining Paulina
Borghese as Venus Victrix (Paulina was Napoleon’s sister) and breath-
taking marble carvings by the young Gian Lorenzo Bernini. His David, cap-
tured in the middle of a slingshot windup, is full of charmingly boyish
concentration; Apollo and Daphne freezes in marble the moment when
the nymph turns into a laurel tree, her fingers bursting into leaves and bark

enveloping her legs. In the Rape of Proserpine, a sculpture Bernini exe-
cuted in collaboration with his father, the god’s fingers uncannily seem to
press into her marble flesh. The extensive painting collection contains
many masterpieces: Caravaggio’s haunting self-portrait as Bacchus and
his St. Jerome Writing, Antonello da Messina’s subtle and mysterious
Portrait of a Man, a young Raphael’s Deposition, and Tiziano’s Sacred
and Profane Love. Andrea del Sarto, Coreggio, Lucas Cranach, Bronzino,
Lorenzo Lotto, and many other artists are also represented in this dazzling
display.
The gallery accommodates only 360 people, so reservations are required
for admission, and your visit must be limited to two hours. (The astound-
ing number of masterpieces will make you long for a second visit.) Be on
time for your reserved slot, or you’ll have to pay again for the next avail-
able time.
In addition to the main gallery, you can make a reservation for the special
visit to the museum storage rooms. Only 18 persons are allowed per day
for the one-hour visit (3–4 p.m.); the price is 2€ ($2.60), including the
reservation fee, and you don’t have to visit the museum to visit the stor-
age rooms. If you are interested, book well in advance.

Capitoline Museums (Musei Capitolini)
Teatro Marcello
The oldest public collection in the world, these museums occupy the two
palazzi (palaces) that open onto the beautiful Piazza del Campidoglio,
designed by Michelangelo. They hold a treasury of ancient sculpture and
an important collection of European paintings from the 17th and 18th cen-
turies. They also preserve the original second-century bronze equestrian
statue of Marcus Aurelius (the one in the middle of the piazza is a copy);
the statue was saved from destruction only because early Christians
thought it was the first Christian emperor, Constantine.
In the Palazzo Nuovo you will find a rich collection of famous ancient
sculptures, such as the Capitoline Venus and the Dying Gaul, a Roman
copy of a Greek original. The collection is more accessible since a number
of the largest pieces were moved to the Montemartini annex (see listing
later in this chapter), making the premises less cramped. Palazzo dei
Conservatori houses more sculpture, starting with the dismembered
pieces of the ancient 40-foot statue of Constantine II in the courtyard,
which you may have seen in photographs — the huge head, hands, foot,
kneecap, and so on. Also here is the famous Lupa Capitolina, the fifth
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
144

century B.C. bronze that is the symbol of Rome, representing a wolf suck-
ling Romulus and Remus. On the top floor is the Pinacoteca Capitolina
(picture gallery), a superb collection including such famous paintings as
Caravaggio’s Fortune Teller and John the Baptist, Titian’s Baptism of
Christ, and works by Veronese, Rubens, and others.
Between the Palazzo Nuovo and the Palazzo dei Conservatori, enclosing
Piazza del Campidoglio to the south, is the Senatorial Palace (Palazzo
Senatorio). Now home to Rome’s municipal offices, it was built in the
Middle Ages over the Tabularium, an imposing building that housed the
public archives of the Roman Republic. The Tabularium itself was built of
massive stone blocks, and its facade was decorated with huge Doric
columns. You can clearly see its remains from the Forum (3 of the original
11 arcades remain). It’s now part of the museum complex, and admission
is included in the ticket.
An in-depth visit to these museums can take you about four hours, but you
can see the highlights in about two hours.
The museums often schedule special exhibits; the separate admission
charge is usually 4.50€ ($5.85), or 1.50€ ($1.95) with museum admission.
See map p. 142. Piazza del Campidoglio 1, off Piazza Venezia. % 06-67102475. www.
museicapitolini.org. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 6.50€ ($8.45). Audio guides:
4€ ($5.20). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–8 p.m.; Dec 24 and Dec 31 9 a.m.–2 p.m. Ticket
booth closes one hour earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Caracalla Baths (Terme di Caracalla)
Aventino
Built by the Roman Emperor Caracalla, these baths were completed in 
A.D. 216 and operated until 537. They are the best-preserved large thermal
baths in Rome, with some of the rich internal decoration still visible,
making it possible to imagine what it must have been like: enormous
columns, hundreds of statues, colored marble and mosaic floors, marble,
stucco, and frescoes on the walls. The baths in Roman times were much
more than just places to wash; people also came here to relax and to exer-
cise. After entering the building from the porticos on the northeast side,
patrons would use the dressing rooms and then move through the baths.
These consisted of deep-cleansing areas, a sort of sauna similar to Turkish
baths, starting in the calidarium (hot room) and proceeding to the tepi-
darium (first cooling down), the frigidarium (complete cooling down), and
natatio (swimming pool). The baths also housed two gymnasiums (exer-
cise rooms), where trainers used to be on duty, gardens for reading and
relaxing, and a library. Plan to spend about an hour here.

Castel Sant’Angelo
San Pietro
This “castle” is a perfect example of recycling Roman style: It began as a
mausoleum to hold the remains of Emperor Hadrian, became a fortress,
and is now a museum. Built in A.D. 123, it may have been incorporated into
the city’s defenses as early as 403 and was attacked by the Goths (one of
the barbarian tribes who pillaged Rome in its decline) in 537. Later, the
popes used it as a fortress and hideout and, for convenience, connected
it to the Vatican palace by an elevated corridor — the passetto — which
you can still see near Borgo Pio. Castel Sant’Angelo houses a museum of
arms and armor; you can also visit the elegant Renaissance papal apart-
ments, as well as the horrible cells that held political prisoners (among
them sculptor Benvenuto Cellini). Count on about two hours for a full visit.
See map p. 142. Lungotevere Castello 50. % 06-6819111. Bus: 62 or 64 to Lungotevere
Vaticano. Admission: 5€ ($6.50). Audio guides: 4€ ($5.20). Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–
8 p.m. Ticket booth closes one hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Catacombs of Saint Callixtus (Catacombe di San Callisto)
Park of Appia Antica
Rome has several places to visit the catacombs, but the catacombs of 
St. Callixtus are among the most impressive, with 20km (121⁄2 miles) of tun-
nels and galleries underground, organized on several levels. The cata-
combs began as quarries outside ancient Rome where travertine marble
and the dirt used in cement were dug. Early Christians hid out, held mass,
and buried their dead in the catacombs. The Catacombs of St. Callixtus
(Callixtus III was an early pope, elected in 217) have four levels, including
a crypt where several early popes are buried and the tomb where 
St. Cecilia’s remains were found. Some of the original paintings and deco-
rations are intact and show that Christian symbolism — doves, anchors,
and fish — was already well developed. You can tour the catacombs in
about one hour. It’s cold down there at 18m/60 ft. under, so bring a sweater.
Other catacombs that are open to the public include the Catacombs of 
St. Sebastian (Via Appia Antica 136; % 06-7850350) and the Catacombs 
of Ste. Domitilla (Via delle Sette Chiese 282; % 06-5110342; www.
domitilla.it).
See map p. 174. Via Appia Antica 110. % 06-51301580. www.catacombe.roma.it.
Metro/Bus: Colli Albani (on Sun to Arco di Travertino); then bus 660 to Via Appia
Antica. Admission: 5€ ($6.50). Open: Thurs–Tues 8:30 a.m. to noon and 2:30–5 p.m.
(in summer to 5:30 p.m.). Closed Feb.
Colosseum (Colosseo or Anfiteatro Flavio)
Colosseo
The Colosseum and St. Peter’s Basilica are Rome’s most recognizable monu-
ments. Begun under the Flavian Emperor Vespasian and finished in A.D. 80,
the structure we now call the Colosseum was named the Amphiteatrum
Flavium. The nickname came from the colossal statue of Nero that was
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
146

erected nearby in the second century A.D. Estimates are that the
Colosseum could accommodate up to 73,000 spectators. The entertain-
ment included fights between gladiators and battles with wild animals. In
the labyrinth of chambers beneath the amphitheater’s original wooden
floor, deadly weapons, vicious beasts, and gladiators were prepared for
mortal combat. (Contrary to popular belief, the routine feeding of
Christians to lions is a legend.) After the end of the Roman Empire, the
Colosseum was damaged by fires and earthquakes, and eventually aban-
doned; it was then used as a marble quarry for the monuments of Christian
Rome until Pope Benedict XV consecrated it in the 18th century. Next to
the Colosseum is the Arch of Constantine, built in 315 to commemorate
the emperor’s victory over the pagan Maxentius in 312. Pieces from other
monuments were reused, so Constantine’s monument includes carvings
honoring Marcus Aurelius, Trajan, and Hadrian.
In the summer of 2000, for the first time in centuries, the Colosseum was
brought to life again with theater performances under the aegis of the Estate
Romana (see Chapters 3 and 15); now it also houses special exhibitions.
We strongly recommend that you reserve tickets to avoid the long lines;
you can do so through the number or Web site below. Otherwise, buy your
ticket at the nearby Palatine Hill booth, where you’ll find only a fraction of
the queue (that is, until this hot tip spreads). Plan to spend about an hour
for your visit.
See map p. 142. Via dei Fori Imperiali. % 06-39967700 (Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and
2:30–5 p.m.). www.pierreci.it for reservations. www.archeorm.arti.
beniculturali.it. Metro: Colosseo. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission: 9€ ($12) plus
2€ ($2.60) for exhibitions. Advance reservation 1.50€ ($1.95). Ticket price includes
admission to the Palatine Hill. Audio guides: 4€ ($5.20). Open: Daily 9 a.m. to one hour
before sunset. Ticket booth closes one hour earlier. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Golden House of Nero (Domus Aurea)
Colosseo
The complex of the Golden House was the brainchild of the infamous
Emperor Nero. Built after the great fire of A.D. 64 (which is traditionally but
perhaps incorrectly blamed on him), it once covered more than 200 acres.
Buildings dotted a park landscaped to look like romantic countryside, with
an artificial lake, pastures, and vineyards. The lavishly decorated main
reception building — the Golden House itself — was abandoned after
Nero’s fall in 68, buried under the thermal baths of the emperors Titus and
Trajan, and forgotten. Romans digging in the “hill” across from the
Colosseum in the 18th century stumbled upon it when they found caves
that turned out to be ceilings of ancient rooms decorated with Roman fres-
coes. Only since 2000 have tourists been allowed to visit these cavernous
spaces, where some of the elegant interior paintings that decorated the
walls survive. Often done in red tones, they tend to depict mythological
scenes surrounded by fine traceries and flourishes. The site was closed
again for restorations in 2006. It is currently “open for restorations”: Small
groups of visitors (20 maximum) are guided through the site to check out
the archeologists and experts at work. We hope the site will be completely

National Etruscan Museum of Villa Giulia 
(Museo Nazionale Etrusco di Villa Giulia)
Villa Borghese
This splendid papal villa, built by the most prominent architects of the
16th century, houses the world’s most important Etruscan collection.
Originally from Asia Minor, the Etruscans were a mysterious people who
dominated Tuscany and Lazio, including Rome, up to the fifth century B.C.
Many of the objects in this museum came from Cerveteri, an important
Etruscan site northwest of Rome. One of the most spectacular objects is
the bride-and-bridegroom sarcophagus from the sixth century B.C., upon
which two enigmatic figures recline. You can also see a fairly well-pre-
served chariot and impressive sculptures. Some of the most amazing
works are the tiniest: The Etruscans made intricate decorative objects
from woven gold, employing goldsmithing techniques that remain a mys-
tery today. In the summer, the garden is the site of musical events (see
Chapter 15). Block out about three hours for a full visit.

National Gallery of Ancient Art in Palazzo Barberini (Galleria
Nazionale d’Arte Antica in Palazzo Barberini)
Via Veneto
Completed in 1633, the Palazzo Barberini is a magnificent example of a
baroque Roman palace. Bernini decorated the rococo apartments the
gallery now occupies, and they’re certainly luxurious. Also preserved in
the Palazzo Barberini is the wedding chamber of Princess Cornelia
Costanza Barberini and Prince Giulio Cesare Colonna di Sciarra, exactly as
it was centuries ago. Although the structure itself is an attraction, the col-
lection of paintings that make up the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica is
most impressive; it includes Caravaggio’s Narcissus, Tiziano’s Venus and
Adonis, and Raphael’s La Fornarina, a loving, informal portrait of the
bakery girl who was his mistress (and the model for his Madonnas). Other
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
150

artists represented are the great Sienese painters Il Sodoma and Simone
Martini, as well as Filippo Lippi. The galleria’s decorative-arts collection
contains not only Italian pieces but also fine imported objects, including
some from Japan. In addition to the permanent collections, the gallery 
regularly mounts special exhibits. Allow two and a half hours for a com-
plete visit.

National Gallery of Modern Art (Galleria Nazionale d’Arte
Moderna/GNAM)
Villa Borghese
Housed in the beautiful, Liberty-style (Italian Art Nouveau) Palazzo delle
Belle Arti, this important museum preserves a rich collection of modern
art from the 19th and 20th centuries. Italian artists dominate, but the col-
lection includes works by all sorts of great artists. The two sections dedi-
cated to the 19th century hold a great selection of paintings by artists of
the Macchiaioli movement and a number of works by French modern
artists such as Rodin, Van Gogh, and Monet; but the real riches are in the
two sections dedicated to the 20th century, where you can admire a pro-
fusion of artwork by De Chirico, Giorgio Morandi, Marino Marini, Lucio
Fontana, and Giò Pomodoro, to name some highlights. The collection also
includes international names such as Pollock, Calder, and Tápies, among
others. Schedule about two hours for your visit.
GNAM’s new annex, MAXXI (Via Reni 2, off Piazza Apollodoro; % 06-
3202438; www.maxximuseo.org) is in the former Barracks Montello
nearby; it holds the museum’s 21st-century collection. Admission is free;
hours are Tuesday to Sunday 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

National Roman Museum in Palazzo Altemps (Museo Nazionale
Romano Palazzo Altemps)
Navona/Pantheon
Situated behind Piazza Navona, this palazzo was begun sometime before
1477 and finished by Marco Sittico Altemps, who enlarged it at the end of
the 1500s. It was restored (revealing the layers of medieval, Renaissance,
and later decoration) to house the Ludovisi Collection. One of the world’s
most famous private art collections, it is particularly strong in Greek and
Roman sculpture as well as Egyptian works. The single most important
piece is a fifth century B.C. Greek masterpiece, the Trono Ludovisi, a
throne finely carved to depict Aphrodite Urania rising from the waves on
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 151

one side; a female figure offering incense on another; and a naked female
playing a flute on yet another. The remarkable Dying Gaul, depicting a
man apparently committing suicide with a sword, was commissioned by
Julius Caesar and placed in his gardens to commemorate his victories in
Gaul. The Ares Ludovisi, a statue restored by Bernini in 1622, is believed
by art historians to be a Roman copy of an earlier Greek work; it shows a
warrior (possibly Achilles) at rest. The colossal head of Hera (also known
as Juno) is one of the best-known Greek sculptures; Goethe wrote of it as
his “first love” in Rome and said it was like “a canto of Homer.” It has been
identified as an idealized portrait of Antonia Augusta, mother of Emperor

National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme (Museo
Nazionale Romano Palazzo Massimo alle Terme)
Repubblica
This is our favorite museum of antiquity in Rome. The astounding collec-
tion of ancient Roman art (from decades of excavations in Rome and its
environs) includes — on the upper level — a unique collection of floor
mosaics and frescoes. Entire rooms from the Villa of Livia on the Palatine
Hill have been reconstructed here, and you can enjoy the frescos as they
were meant to be. Note: You can visit the fresco collection by guided tour
only. You can sign up when you enter, but it is best to make an advance
reservation. On the lower floors, you’ll find a huge sculpture collection
with the striking satyr pouring wine, a Roman copy of the original by
Greek sculptor Praxiteles; the Daughter of Niobe, from the Gardens of
Sallust; and an Apollo copied from an original by Phidias, one of the great-
est ancient Greek sculptors. We also enjoyed the interesting series of
sculptures showing how the style of representation changed under vari-
ous emperors and discussing the family resemblances of the Claudians,
Flavians, and other dynasties. Even the basement contains some fascinat-
ing things: a well-done numismatic exhibit, with coins dating from the 8th
century B.C. through the 21st century that explain the economy of ancient
Rome and of Renaissance Italy; and the royal house of Savoy’s collection
of Roman jewelry, including many items from burial sites, such as a rare
Roman mummy of a child buried with her most precious belongings. The
entire visit, including the tour of the fresco collection, will take you a mini-
mum of two hours.

Palatine Hill (Palatino)
Colosseo
This is one of our preferred spots in Rome: Huge blocks of brick sur-
rounded by trees and greenery testify mutely to what was once an enor-
mous residential complex of patrician houses and imperial palaces, built
to match the emperors’ grandiose ambitions. The throne room of the
Domus Flavia, for instance, was approximately 30m (100 ft.) wide by 39.3m
(131 ft.) long. This hill is also where Romulus drew the original square for
the foundation of Rome and the first houses were built; indeed, excava-
tions in the area uncovered remains that date to the eighth century B.C.
Casa di Livia (Livia’s House) is one of the best-preserved homes. During
the Middle Ages, the site was used as a fortress, and during the
Renaissance it became the play place of the aristocracy: Here Cardinal
Alessandro Farnese built the Horti Palatini, the first botanical garden in
the Western world, in 1625. Built on top of the palaces of Tiberius and
Caligula, it was a marvel of architecture, with ramps, terraces, and foun-
tains. Today, after systematic archeological excavations started toward
the end of the 19th century, only the aviaries remain, deprived of their
pagoda-shaped netting roofs. Housed in the onetime Palace of Caesar —
later transformed into a convent — is the Palatine Museum. The most pre-
cious artwork recovered from the archeological excavations of the
Palatino, including frescoes and sculptures, is conserved here. (Admission
is included in your ticket.) The ruins on the Palatine Hill are impressive
but may be confusing without a guided tour. We definitely recommend
taking one; they are cheap and make a world of difference. Depending on
your pace and whether you visit the museum, leave one and a half to two
and a half hours for your visit. Note: At press time, the Casa di Livia and
the Casa di Augusto were temporarily closed for restoration, and the Casa
dei Grifi was open only on the first Saturday of each month.

Pantheon
Navona/Pantheon
Rome’s best-preserved monument of antiquity, the imposing Pantheon was
rebuilt by the Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 125 over the smaller original temple
constructed by Marcus Agrippa in 27 B.C. to honor all the gods (pan theon
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 153

Part IV: Exploring Rome 
154
means “all gods” in ancient Greek). It was eventually saved from destruc-
tion by being transformed into a Christian church in A.D. 609. The adjective
that all descriptions of the Pantheon should contain is perfect: The build-
ing is 43m (142 ft.) wide and 43m (142 ft.) tall. The portico is supported by
huge granite columns, all but three of which are original, and the bronze
doors weigh 20 tons each. Inside, the empty niches surrounding the space
once contained marble statues of Roman gods; most of the marble floor is
also original. Animals were once sacrificed beneath the beautiful coffered
dome, whose 5.4m (18-ft.) hole (oculus) lets in the light (and sometimes
rain) of the Eternal City. An architectural marvel, this dome inspired
Michelangelo when he was designing St. Peter’s, though he made the basili-
ca’s dome 0.6m (2 ft.) smaller. Inside, you’ll find the tombs of the painter
Raphael and of two of the kings of Italy. Crowds always congregate in the
square in front, Piazza della Rotonda (Piazza del Pantheon to Romans),
one of the nicest squares in Rome; it is graced by a fountain by Giacomo
della Porta. Cafes line the square along with a McDonald’s, an addition
much opposed by the locals. A half-hour should be enough to take in the
highlights of the monument; allow another hour to soak in the atmosphere
from the terrace of one of the cafes.

Free. Open: Mon–Sat 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Sun 9 a.m.–6 p.m., holidays 9 a.m.–1 p.m.
Piazza di Spagna and Spanish Steps
Piazza di Spagna
The Piazza and its famous steps are one of the favorite meeting places of
Rome. In good weather, you can hardly see the ground when it’s covered
with wall-to-wall tourists, lovers, backpackers, Roman youth, and so on.
The atmosphere is festive and convivial, though, and it’s especially roman-
tic in spring, when the steps are decorated with colorful azaleas. The
piazza’s name dates to the 16th century, when the Spanish ambassador
made his residence here. In those days, the piazza was far less hospitable.
(People passing through at night sometimes disappeared, because it was
technically Spanish territory, and the unwary could be press-ganged into
the Spanish army.) In more recent times, the area’s most famous resident
was English poet John Keats, who lived and died in the house to the right
of the steps, which is now the Keats–Shelley Memorial House (% 06-
6784235; Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–6 p.m., Sat 11 a.m.–2 p.m. and 
3–6 p.m.; admission: 3€/$3.60). When you climb the steps, you’ll find their
real name: Scalinata della Trinità dei Monti, because they lead to the
Trinità dei Monti church, whose towers loom above. At the foot of the
steps, the boat-shaped fountain by Pietro Bernini, father of Gian Lorenzo,
is one of the most famous in Rome. In May 2007, a drunken vandal dam-
aged the fountain on one side, but he was immediately arrested; restora-
tion was started right after the event and should be completed by the time
you read this.

Piazza Navona
Navona/Pantheon
Our favorite piazza in Rome, this is the most beautiful and also one of the
most popular hangouts. Built on the ruins of the Stadium of Domitian from
the first century A.D., where chariot races were held (note the oval track
form), it has retained its public role: Between the 17th and 19th centuries,
the bottom of the square was flooded for float parades in the summer, and
it is now the location of the traditional Epiphany market during the
Christmas period. The twin-towered facade of Santa Agnese in Agone domi-
nates the piazza. The baroque masterpiece is by Borromini, who renovated
and rebuilt the original church, which had been constructed on the site
between the 8th and the 12th centuries. The interior was also redecorated
in the 17th century, but in the lower level, you’ll find vestiges of Domitian’s
stadium, with an ancient Roman mosaic floor. The square’s other great
baroque masterpiece is Bernini’s Fountain of the Four Rivers, with mas-
sive figures representing the Nile, Danube, della Plata, and Ganges — the
figure with the shrouded head is the Nile, because its source was unknown
at the time. Built in 1651, it is crowned by an obelisk, a Roman copy from
Domitian’s time. This fountain came as a monumental addition to the two
simple fountains already existing at each end of the square and created in
1576 by Giacomo della Porta. They were decorated with figures only later.
Bernini designed the figures of the Fountain of the Moor at the piazza’s
south end (the tritons and other ornaments are 19th-century copies made
to replace the originals, which were moved to the Villa Borghese lake
garden). The figures of the Fountain of Neptune, at the piazza’s north end,
were added in the 19th century to balance the Fountain of the Moor. On the
southeast side of the square is the famous Palazzo Braschi, housing the
Museo di Roma (see listing later in this chapter).

How to attend a papal audience
Papal audiences attract many — Catholics and non — who come to see and hear the
pope live as he addresses the crowd gathered in front of him. The audiences are held
on Wednesdays, indoors during the winter (Oct–Mar) and outdoors in a gated area in
front of the basilica in fair weather (Apr–Sept). Entrance is allowed between 10 and
10:30 a.m., but lines form earlier by the gates, where you pass security (similar to air-
port screening). Tickets are free but you must reserve them in advance by writing or
faxing your request (indicating your language, the dates of your visit, the number of
people in your party, and, if possible, the hotel in Rome to which the office should send
your tickets the afternoon before the audience) to the Prefecture of the Papal
Household (00120 Città del Vaticano/Holy See; % 06-69884857; fax 06-69885863;
Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m.). You can pick them up the afternoon before the audience at the
Prefecture office entrance, near the porta di bronzo (bronze door) under St. Peter’s
right colonnade.

St. Peter’s Square (Piazza San Pietro)
San Pietro
Bernini designed the piazza, one of the world’s greatest public spaces, in
the 17th century. As you stand in the huge piazza (no cars allowed), you’re
in the arms of an ellipse partly enclosed by a majestic Doric-pillared colon-
nade, atop which stand statues of some 140 saints. Straight ahead is the
facade of St. Peter’s Basilica; the two statues flanking the entrance repre-
sent St. Peter, Peter carrying the Keys to the Kingdom, and St. Paul. To the
right, above the colonnade, are the ochre buildings of the papal apart-
ments and the Vatican Museums. In the center of the square is an Egyptian
obelisk, brought from the ancient city of Heliopolis on the Nile delta. On
either side are 17th-century fountains — the one on the right by Carlo
Maderno, who designed the facade of St. Peter’s, was placed here by
Bernini himself; the one on the left is by Carlo Fontana. The piazza is par-
ticularly magical at night during the Christmas season, when a presepio
(nativity scene) and a large tree take center stage.
See map p. 142. Bus: 62 or 64. Metro: Ottaviano/San Pietro; take Via di Porta Angelica,
and follow it to the end.
Roman Forum (Foro Romano)
Colosseo
This was Rome’s original forum, a large public space used as a market and
meeting venue. As Rome grew, the structure became too small to accom-
modate the needs of the imperial capital, and it was gradually expanded
by various emperors, who each added an extra bit (creating the Imperial
Fori; see listing later in this chapter). The forum remained the heart of
public life in ancient Rome for over a thousand years. The ruins lie in the
valley between the Capitoline Hill, site of the great Jupiter Temple, and the
Palatine Hill, where the royal palace, and later the palaces of other noble
families, were located. The forum was built at the end of the seventh cen-
tury B.C., after the existing marshes were drained by the Cloaca Massima,
the huge drainage and sewer canal under the forum. The forum is crossed
by the Via Sacra, the “sacred street,” so called because it led to the main
temples on the Capitoline Hill (today, Piazza del Campidoglio). A stone dis-
covered under the forum in 1899 bears an inscription from the sixth cen-
tury B.C., the time of the Roman kings. The forum has many ruins (some,
like the sanctuary of the sewer goddess Venus Cloaca, are just a mark on
the ground), as well as a few standing buildings. The most important struc-
ture is the square Curia, where the Senate once met; many of the walls
were heavily restored in 1937, but the marble-inlay floor inside is original,
from the third century A.D. Also well conserved is the Temple of Antoninus
and Faustina (the Emperor Antoninus Pius, who succeeded Hadrian in A.D.
138), because it was turned into a church and given a baroque facade (as
the Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Miranda).
Near the Curia is the Arch of Septimius Severus, built in A.D. 203 to com-
memorate this emperor’s victories. The arch originally mentioned his two
sons, Caracalla and Geta, but after Caracalla murdered Geta, Geta’s name
was removed. At the other end of the forum is the Arch of Titus. Titus

reigned as emperor from A.D. 79 to 81. Nearby is the hulking form of the
fourth-century Basilica of Constantine and Maxentius, which occupies the
site of what was Rome’s law courts. The Temple of the Dioscuri, dedicated
to the twins Castor and Pollux, is immediately recognizable by its three
remaining columns joined by a piece of architrave. Against the Capitoline
Hill, you see the Temple of Saturn, which housed the first treasury of Rome.
It was also the site of the feast that was the pagan ancestor of Christmas.
If you buy a map as you enter, you can identify the sometimes faint traces
of a host of other structures (also see the map “The Roman Forum,” above).
Note: At press time, the Antiquarium Forense, which contains materials
from the excavations of the forum, was closed for restoration. No date was
set for the reopening, but check for updates at the ticket booth or with the
tourist office.
As with any archaeological site, things often make much more sense if
you take a guided tour. The tour in English is at 10:30 a.m. daily and lasts
about an hour. Ask at the ticket booth or, even better, make a reservation.

Saint John Lateran’s Basilica (Basilica di San Giovanni in
Laterano) and Cloister (Chiostro)
Colosseo
Built in A.D. 13 by Constantine, this cathedral of the diocese of Rome 
(St. Peter’s Basilica is in the separate city-state of the Vatican) suffered
many indignities, including being sacked by the Vandals (a barbarian
tribe), burned, and then damaged in an 896 earthquake. Always faithfully
restored, it is quite an impressive sight, chock full of art and religious treas-
ures. The facade, designed and executed by Alessandro Galilei in 1735, is
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions

crowned by 15 giant statues (7m/22 ft. tall) representing Christ, St. John
the Baptist, John the Evangelist, and other “doctors” (leading lights) of the
Church; they are tall enough to be visible from surprising distant points
in Rome. Outside is an Egyptian obelisk, the tallest in Rome (32m/105 ft.),
consecrated in the fourth century as a symbol of Christianity’s victory
over pagan cults.
The 17th-century architect Borromini redesigned the interior of the basil-
ica as you see it today. Make sure you find the papal altar, protected by a
beautiful 14th-century ciborium: it preserves the wooden altar on which
Peter and the other Paleo-Christian popes after him are said to have cele-
brated mass in ancient Rome’s catacombs. Another important relic is pre-
served by the altar of the Santissimo Sacramento, in the left transept:
Decorated with four giant gilded-bronze columns salvaged from the original
basilica, its ciborium protects what is believed to be the very table of
Christ’s Last Supper. Attached to the church is the original fourth-century
Baptistery; built by Constantine, it is the first of the Western world. Restored
inside over the centuries, it was redone in its present form by Borromini
when he redesigned the rest of the cathedral. Our favorite part in the entire
church is the delightful 13th-century cloister, accessible through a side door.
It was designed by Vassalletto and is a showcase for carvings and other art
pieces salvaged from the older basilica, including a number of Paleo-
Christian inscriptions. Set aside at least an hour for your visit.

St. Peter’s Basilica (Basilica di San Pietro)
San Pietro
In 324, Emperor Constantine commissioned a sanctuary to be built on the
site of St. Peter’s tomb. The first apostle was thought to have been buried
here under a simple stone, and excavation and studies commissioned by
the Vatican under the Basilica have confirmed that thesis. The original

Vatican Necropolis and St. Peter’s Tomb
If you are 15 or older and interested in religious archeology, you may want to book a
visit to the Necropolis and excavations that extend beyond the Grottoes under St.
Peter’s Basilica. Accessible by guided tour only, they make a fascinating visit. You’ll
need to make your reservations in advance by fax (06-69873017) or e-mail
(scavi@fsp.va) to the Excavation Office specifying desired language, number and
names of each person in your party, requested dates, and contact information. You’ll
receive a proposed time, which you must confirm, again in writing. Admission is 10€
($13) per person. The Vatican receives more requests for the visit than it can accom-
modate, so make arrangements well in advance.

Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 161
basilica stood for about 1,000 years, but with its accrued importance and
stability, the Papacy decided it was time for renovations. Work began in
1503 following designs by the architects Sangallo and Bramante. In 1547,
Michelangelo was appointed to finish the magnificent dome, but he died
in 1564 before seeing its work completed. His disciple Giacomo della Porta
finished the job. The inside of the basilica is almost too huge to take in
(the best spot to appreciate its huge size is at the central square part);
walking from one end to the other is a workout, and the opulence will over-
power you. On the right as you enter is Michelangelo’s exquisite Pietà,
created when the master was in his early 20s. (Because of an act of van-
dalism in the 1970s, the statue is kept behind reinforced glass.) Dominating
the central nave is Bernini’s 29m-tall (96-ft.) baldaquin, supported by
richly decorated twisting columns. Completed in 1633, it was criticized for
being excessive and because the bronze was supposedly taken from the
Pantheon. The canopy stands over the papal altar, which in turn stands
over the symbolic tomb of St. Peter. A bronze statue of St. Peter (proba-
bly by Arnolfo di Cambio, 13th century) marks the tomb; its right foot has
been worn away by the millions of pilgrims kissing it in the traditional
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions

devotional gesture to salute the pope. By the apse, above an altar, is the
bronze throne sculpted by Bernini to house the remains of what is,
according to legend, the chair of St. Peter.
At the right-hand side of the Basilica’s entrance, under the loggia, you’ll
find two lines. The one on the right is for Michelangelo’s dome, and the
one on the left is for the Vatican Grottoes.
You can visit the dome and marvel at the astounding view. An elevator
saves you the first 171 steps of the climb, but you have to book it when you
buy your ticket to the dome and pay an additional 3€ ($3.90). Expect a line.
The view is already good, but you won’t have the full effect (guaranteed to
take your breath away) unless you climb the additional 420 steps or so.
Make sure that you’re ready and willing to climb, however, because after
you’ve started up, you’re not allowed to turn around and go back down.
Beneath the basilica are the spaces created during the construction, partly
retracing the original Basilica built by Emperor Constantine, and partly
going down to the preexisting necropolis over which the emperor built the
first St. Peter’s. In the main halls you’ll find the tombs of the popes and a
collection of Paleo-Christian sarcophagi and art fragments salvaged from
the original basilica. It is a huge space encompassing two dozen rooms.
(Note: This is not the visit to the Necropolis and archaeological excava-
tions. That is a special affair that needs advance reservation. See sidebar
earlier in this chapter.)
From the left nave, you can reach the Treasury (Museo del Tesoro di San
Pietro). Still very rich in spite of having being pillaged by the Saracens in
846, by Charles V in 1527, and by Napoleon in 1797, it contains several
relics and works of art. Look for Donatello’s ciborium in hall II, the majes-
tic monument for Sixtus IV by Pollaiolo in hall III, and the splendid Roman
sarcophagus in hall IX, depicting scenes from the Old and the New
Testament (the prefect buried in it was a convert).
Plan on at least two hours for your visit, and more if you want to see every-
thing. Note: Strict security governs public entrance, and you’ll have to line
up at the right-hand side of the colonnade to pass through the security
checkpoint (airport-style procedure, with metal detector). Travelers with
disabilities will have to pass security, but then can use a special elevator
located at the end of the cloakroom to the right of the steps.
The best time to visit to avoid lines is before 9 a.m. After that, the growing
throngs of visitors make for lengthy waits at security.
Consider that at the Vatican, even the men wear ankle-length gowns, and
the most popular color is black. Bare shoulders, halter tops, tank tops,
shorts, and skirts above the knee will definitely result in your being turned
away from the basilica, whether you are man or woman.

Trajan’s Markets and Trajan’s Forum (Mercati Traianei 
and Foro di Traiano)
Colosseo
Julius Caesar was the first to respond to the need for larger public space
in the Roman capital, and he created the first of the Imperial Fori between
54 and 46 B.C. As the city continued to grow, the following emperors fol-
lowed his example, and four more forums were added, each a large open
space surrounded by a portico with a temple on one end, and each bear-
ing the name of the emperor who built it. After Augustus, Vespasian, and
Nerva, Trajan built the last and most splendid. The luxurious public con-
structions adjacent to the original Roman Forum (see listing earlier in this
chapter) were built between A.D. 107 and 113. They include an elegant open
space — Trajan’s Forum — overlooked by a tall curved building —
Trajan’s Markets. Although maimed by the pillage of marble and decora-
tion during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance (when the marble was
used for other construction), the archaeological remains are fascinating.
Walking north along the Via dei Fori Imperiali from the Colosseum, you can
see the archaeological site from the outside (to your right), but obviously,
a visit to the impressive brick complex itself affords an irreplaceable expe-
rience. You can walk along stalls and small boutiques — sort of an ancient
mall — as well as meeting places. Once inside the compound, it will be
easier to imagine what the area must have looked like before the con-
struction in 1920 of Via dei Fori Imperiali, a major transportation artery of
modern Rome. Most of the Imperial Fori were covered in that occasion,
and today, the entire area is being excavated in the largest Roman archae-
ological excavation to date, started in 2004. The plan is to exhibit the find-
ings of these excavations in the Trajan Markets. Note: To accommodate

Tricky transformers
If you are visiting at the height of summer and have kids in tow, one thing that children
(and grown-ups) usually find highly entertaining is watching as tourists try to cover
their bare shoulders and knees with flowery scarves and shawls sold by entrepre-
neurial vendors near the entrance to St. Peter’s. Women have to do it, too, but usually
men are the most hilarious to watch (no offense meant). We know of people who make
it a regular family outing. It can be a good way to entertain the kids while the grown-
ups take turns seeing the art inside.

the excavation, the visit has temporarily been reduced to Trajan’s Forum
and part of the semicircular building; the temporary entrance is from
Trajan’s Column off Piazza Venezia. Count on about 40 minutes for the
reduced visit.
Via 4 Novembre 94. % 06-6790048. Metro: Colosseo. Bus: Minibus 117. Admission:
3.20€ ($4.20). Open Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m. winter, until 6:30 p.m. in summer.
Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi)
Trevi
Fronting its own little piazza, this massive fountain existed for centuries in
relative obscurity before it became one of the must-see sights of Rome,
thanks to the 1954 film Three Coins in the Fountain. Today, it seems that
many of the thousands who clog the space in front of it don’t take the time
to really look at it; instead, they throw coins in it, have their pictures taken
in front of it, and go on their way. If you want a tranquil moment to actu-
ally appreciate the artwork, you must visit late at night or early in the
morning. The fountain was begun by Bernini and Pietro da Cortona, but
there was a 100-year lapse in the work, and it wasn’t completed until 1751,
by Nicola Salvi. The central figure is Neptune, who guides a chariot pulled
by plunging sea horses. Tritons (mythological sea dwellers) guide the
horses, and the surrounding scene is one of wild nature and bare stone.
Of course, you have to toss a coin in the Trevi fountain, something all kids
love to do. To do it properly (Romans are superstitious), hold the coin in
your right hand, turn your back to the fountain, and toss the coin over
your left shoulder. According to tradition, the spirit of the fountain will
then see to it that you return to Rome one day.
See map p. 142. Piazza di Trevi. Bus: 62 or Minibus 116 or 119. Take Via Poli to the
fountain.
Vatican Gardens (Giardini Vaticani)
San Pietro
People often think that the Vatican is made up of only the basilica and the
museums, but behind those walls lies a busy town surrounding a huge —
and splendid — park. You can catch a glimpse of the park from the windows

The Holy See
In 1929, the Lateran Treaty between Pope Pius XI and the Italian government recog-
nized the independent state of the Holy See, with its physical seat in Vatican City (St.
Peter’s Basilica and adjacent buildings). Politically independent from Italy, the Vatican
is the world’s second-smallest sovereign state, with its own administration, post office,
and tourist office. The Vatican comprises St. Peter’s Basilica (p. 160), the Vatican
Museums (p. 165), and the Vatican Gardens (see below).

of the Vatican Museums, revealing groomed grounds, fountains, and ele-
gant Renaissance buildings. Normally you need a permit to enter the
Vatican grounds, but the special guided tours afford a unique opportunity
to see what goes on beyond those gates. The two-hour tours take small
numbers of visitors to the gardens, partly by bus and partly on foot (some
of it on graveled paths). If you forgot to arrange a reservation (by fax or
e-mail only; see below), try to sign up directly at the Vatican Information
Office (see contact information at the beginning of this chapter) — it may
be able to fit you in.
Remember to be clothed in accordance with Vatican rules for your visit
(see note at the end of St. Peter’s Basilica entry).

Vatican Museums (Musei Vaticani)
San Pietro
This enormous complex of museums could swallow up your entire vaca-
tion, with its tons of Egyptian, Etruscan, Greek, Roman, Paleo-Christian, and
Renaissance art. Four museums house the art: the Gregorian Egyptian
Museum, a fantastic collection of Egyptian artifacts; the Gregorian
Etruscan Museum, a beautiful collection of Etruscan art and jewelry; the
Ethnological Missionary Museum, a large collection of artifacts from every
continent, including superb African, Asian, and Australian art; and the
Pinacoteca (picture gallery), the most famous of the Vatican Museums,
which contains works by medieval and Renaissance masters. In Room 9 of
the Pinacoteca is Leonardo da Vinci’s St. Jerome, which has been pieced
back together — one piece had ended up as a stool seat in a shoemaker’s
shop; the other, as a tabletop in an antiques shop. In Room 2 is Giotto’s
luminous Stefaneschi Triptych; in Room 8, Raphael’s Transfiguration.
Other highlights include works by Beato Angelico, Perugino, Bernini, and
Caravaggio (a single but great painting, the Deposition from the Cross).
Also part of the museums are the Stanze di Raffaello. The name translates
as Raphael’s Rooms, after the artist who frescoed them; they are in fact
the private apartments of Pope Julius II. The largest of the four rooms is
the room of Constantine, painted between 1517 and 1524, which illustrates
key moments in the life of the first Christian emperor, including his tri-
umph over Maxentius and his vision of the cross. Along the way, you’ll
come across the Appartamento Borgia (Borgia Apartments), designed
for Pope Alexander VI (the infamous Borgia pope), and the Cappella di
Nicola V (Chapel of Nicholas V), with floor-to-ceiling frescoes by Fra
Angelico.
But of course, the Sistine Chapel (Cappella Sistina), Michelangelo’s mas-
terpiece, is the crowning glory of the museums. Accessible only from the
Museums, the chapel is smaller than one would expect. But lift your eyes
and you’ll be transported into another world: Michelangelo’s grandiose
frescoes completely cover the ceilings. Years after their restoration (a 
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 165

Part IV: Exploring Rome 
166
20-year affair that started in 1979), conflict continues over whether too
much paint was removed, flattening the figures. On the other hand, the bril-
liant color has been restored. Whether you like the colors of the drapery or
not, Michelangelo’s modeling of the human form is incredible. The Creation
of Adam and the temptation and fall of Adam and Eve are the most famous
scenes. Michelangelo also painted a terrifying and powerful Last Judgment
on the end wall. The ceilings’ frescoes dwarf the frescoes on the other walls,
yet they are by famous 15th-century Tuscan and Umbrian artists: Botticelli,
Perugino, Ghirlandaio, and Pinturicchio, among others.
The light is at its best in the morning; try to schedule your visit for that
time. Binoculars or even a hand mirror will help you appreciate the Sistine
ceiling better; your neck tires long before you can take it all in. Just think
how poor Michelangelo must have felt while painting it flat on his back
atop a tower of scaffolding!
Note: Visiting the entire museum complex in one day is impossible (do not
even think of following it up with a visit to St. Peter’s). Four color-coded
itineraries (A, B, C, or D), take you to the highlights of the museums. They
range from one and a half to five hours, and all end at the Sistine Chapel.
You can pick and choose according to your personal taste: Perhaps you’re
fascinated by ancient Egypt and are only marginally interested in paint-
ings; maybe you prefer to view African and Asian art and the frescoed
apartments. Whatever you do, we feel that the audio guide is essential
(rental: 5.50€/$7.15); it discusses over 300 artworks; select what you want
to hear by pressing a work’s label number.
The museums charge no admission on the last Sunday of each month, but
the crowds are unbelievable, especially in good weather. We recommend
paying a visit during a less busy time; after all, you don’t know whether
you’ll have time to come back.
We strongly recommend booking a guided tour, even if you are not the
guided-tour type, and particularly if you are visiting during high season. It
is the only way to avoid the huge lines to enter the museums (people
sometimes line up hours before opening time). The two-hour tour includes
Raphael’s Rooms and the Sistine Chapel, and it is well worth the money:
you’ll breeze through the crowds to your desired attraction without fur-
ther ado. Book in advance (one month to one week), by fax only, at
06-69885100. You will receive a fax confirmation that grants you access to
the “Guided Tour” special ticket booth (main Museums gate, Viale
Vaticano, right-hand side line).
Proper attire is required to access the museums; see note at the end of the
St. Peter’s Basilica entry.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
The list of world famous attractions in Rome is so long that hurried
tourists often overlook lesser-known sights. Yet so many of them are
well worth a visit. Here are a few of our favorites, organized by type.
For art gallery lovers
Painters from all over the world have worked in Rome over the cen-
turies, and their works feature an astounding number of private and
public collections around the city. All of the biggies we review in the first
part of this chapter have been reorganized and modernized, but not all
of the second-tier destinations have yet had the same luck — some
remain dusty and old-fashioned.
Colonna Gallery (Galleria Colonna)
Trevi
Reopened after a long closure and completely restored, this is the private
gallery of the noble Roman family Colonna, housed in the palazzo where
some of the family still lives. This is why the gallery is open Saturday only,
but seeing it is worth a special effort. The visit includes some of the actual
apartments, such as the Appartamento Principessa Isabelle in the 15th-
century wing, splendidly decorated with frescoes by Pinturicchio (Sala
della Fontana) and a collection of paintings by Flemish masters, including
such artists as Jan Brueghel the Elder. The 17th-century wing — the actual
gallery — is a baroque extravaganza of works of art and precious furnish-
ings, including masterpieces by Lotto, Tiziano, Rubens, and Guercino,
among others. Note: Travelers with disabilities enter from the main gate.
See map p. 142. Piazza Santi Apostoli 66 (public entrance Via della Pilotta 17). % 06-
6784350. www.galleriacolonna.it. Bus: 61, 62, 63, 80 to Piazza San Silvestro.
Admission: 7€ ($9.10) adults, 5.50€ ($7.15) children 10 and up, travelers with dis-
abilities, and seniors 60 and older. Open: Sat 9 a.m.–1 p.m. Closed Aug.
Corsini Gallery (Galleria Nazionale d’Arte 
Antica di Palazzo Corsini)
Trastevere
This lesser-known gallery is a little gem. Located below the Janiculum Hill
by Trastevere, it is the only 18th-century picture gallery that has survived
intact. Created by Cardinal Neri Maria Corsini, nephew of Pope Clement
XII, it was donated, complete with most of the furnishings, to the Italian
State in 1883. The painting collection includes works by Italian masters
such as Beato Angelico, Andrea del Sarto, and Caravaggio, as well as for-
eign artists, including some of the best Dutch painters of the period,
including Rubens and Van Dyck. Scattered among the rooms you’ll also
find a number of sculpture masterpieces, of which the most impressive
are the first century B.C. Coppa Corsini (carved in solid silver), and the

Republic age.

75, 170 to Lungotevere. Admission: 4€ ($5.20). Open: Sept–June Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–
7:30 p.m.; July–Aug Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–2 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier.
Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Doria Pamphilj Gallery (Galleria Doria Pamphilj)
Navona/Pantheon
This is the place to come if you want to know what it was like to live in an
18th-century Roman palace. Still the residence of the aristocratic Doria
Pamphilj family, it admits the public to the picture gallery and historical
apartments. The palazzo houses one of Rome’s most important private art
collections; its lavish apartments abound with tapestries, beautiful fur-
nishings, and art. The gallery holds some superb artwork, including paint-
ings by Filippo Lippi, Raphael, Caravaggio, Tiziano, and our favorite,
Velázquez’s portrait of Pope Innocent X. The gallery schedules classical
music concerts on selected evenings; combine one with a visit to the gal-
leries (check the Web site or with the tourist office for a schedule).
See map p. 142. Piazza del Collegio Romano 1/A, off Via del Corso. % 06-6797323.
www.doriapamphilj.it. Bus: 62, 116, 117 or 119. Admission: 8€ ($10) including
audio guides; 12€ ($16) with the concert. Open: Fri–Wed 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Jan
1, Easter Sunday, May 1, Aug 15, and Dec 25.
Spada Gallery (Galleria Spada)
Campo de’ Fiori
The gorgeous 16th-century Palazzo Spada houses Italy’s State Council, and
for a long time only a small number of the privileged could enjoy the unique
art inside. Fortunately for all of us common mortals, it finally partly opened
to the public, and we can now admire some of the riches inside. The elegant
inner courtyard allows access to the beautiful library, where you can
admire the unique Galleria della Perspettiva designed by Borromini
(Borromini’s Perspective) — a magnificent corridor in trompe l’oeil style,
which appears to be some 35 m (1,050 ft) long but is actually only 8m (24
ft). The rich picture gallery is on the upper floor; its four rooms display a
collection of works focusing mostly on 17th-century artists, including
Guido Reni, Guercino, and Tiziano. It is hung in Renaissance style, just as
it was when Cardinal Bernadino Spada acquired many of the works: The
paintings hang against walls that are richly decorated, gilded, and painted.
We find particularly interesting some works by women: Lavinia Fontana
(1552–1614) and Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1652).
See map p. 142. Piazza Capo di Ferro 13, off Piazza Farnese. % 06-6832409. Bus: 116.
Admission: 5€ ($6.50). Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Ticket office closes 30
minutes earlier. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.

For museum buffs
If you love museums, Rome is the perfect destination for you. The prob-
lem, if any, is that there are too many to take in on a single visit, unless
you’re staying for weeks or months. The advantage is that you can find a
museum to satisfy everyone’s taste and special interests. Here are a few
suggestions in addition to the must-see choices in the previous section.
Decorative Arts Museum (Museo delle Arti Decorative)
Via Veneto
Also called the Boncompagni-Ludovisi Museum (after the donors), this
museum opened in 1995 in a villa donated by the heirs of Prince Andrea
Boncompagni in 1972. The rich collection — mostly from donations by
famous artists and collectors — illustrates the evolution of decorative arts
in Italy from the end of the 18th century to the present through splendid
furnishings and artistic glass windows. Besides a permanent core, the rest
of the collection is displayed in rotating thematic exhibitions. One section
of the museum is dedicated to haute couture and costumes, based on
donations from such famous names as Valentino, Lancetti, and Galitzine.
See map p. 142. Via Boncompagni 18. % 06-42824074. www.gnam.arti.
beniculturali.it. Bus: 62, 63. Admission: Free. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.
Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Jewish Museum and Ghetto (Museo Ebraico)
Teatro Marcello
The Jewish community has played an important role on the shaping of
Rome’s culture. Many are the traits that exhibit Jewish influence, not least
in the cuisine; where would we be without the delicious carciofi alla giudia
(deep-fried Roman artichokes)! The ruling Catholic Church segregated the
Jewish population in the ghetto (gated area) in the 16th century, some-
thing Romans are not proud of. During the Nazi occupation, many priests
and Gentile citizens risked their lives to harbor those targeted by the
Germans. Housed in a synagogue, the museum reopened in 2005 after
lengthy renovations. It traces the history of the local community. The tour
includes a visit to two temples, Tempio Maggiore and Tempio Spagnolo,
both housing furnishings from the Ghetto’s five original synagogues, which
were demolished in 1908. The synagogue is also the meeting point for
guided tours of the Ghetto organized by the local cultural association. You
can sign up at the museum for the one-hour tour, which costs 8€ ($10) for
adults, 5€ ($6.50) for students.
See map p. 142. Tempio Maggiore, Lungotevere Cenci. % 06-68400661. www.museo
ebraico.roma.it. Tram: 8. Bus: 23, 63, 271, and 630. Admission: 7.50€ ($9.75);
children under 10 and visitors with disabilities free. Open: June 16–Sept 15 Sun–Thurs
10 a.m.–7 p.m.; Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m.; Sept 16–June 15 Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Fri 
9 a.m.–2 p.m. Visits by guided tours every hour, included in admission price. Closed
Jan 1, Aug 15, and Jewish holidays (see museum’s Web site).
Part IV: Exploring Rome

Museum of the City of Rome (Museo di Roma)
Piazza Navona and Trastevere
Housed in the 18th-century Palazzo Braschi, off gorgeous Piazza Navona,
this museum reopened in 2002 after being closed for 15 years. Thanks to
an $8-million restoration, the palazzo and its grand staircase — both justly
celebrated for their unique architectural quality — have been returned to
their baroque splendor. The collection covers the cultural, social, and
artistic life of the city from the Middle Ages to the first half of the 20th cen-
tury, based on paintings, engravings, sculpture and decorative art.
Interesting temporary exhibitions are often on display as well.
A branch of this museum in Trastevere specializes on Roman folklore. It is
usually a hit with children, who love the scenes re-creating typical
moments of life in bygone Rome. There are only few of those, though, and
the rest of the collection is better suited to a more mature audience who
will appreciate the collection of drawings, watercolors, and paintings.
See map p. 142. Piazza Navona Branch: Via di San Pantaleo 10; % 06-67108346; www.
museodiroma.comune.roma.it; open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.; admission:
6.20€ ($8); Trastevere branch: Piazza di Sant’Egidio 1/b; % 06-5899359; open:
Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–8 p.m.; admission: 2.60€ ($3.40). Both branches closed Jan 1, 
May 1, and Dec 25.
National Museum of Musical Instruments (Museo 
Nazionale degli Strumenti Musicali)
Colosseo
Even if you aren’t a musician, you’ll love the incredible variety of instru-
ments — some of them true works of art — in this wonderful museum.
Begun with the private collection of the Italian tenor Evan Gorga (he was
the first Rodolfo in Puccini’s La Bohème in 1896), it now consists of more
than 3,000 pieces stretching from antiquity to the 19th century. Among the
showstoppers is a piano built in 1722 by the inventor of the piano,
Bartolomeo Cristofori. Also on display are a beautiful harpsichord built in
Leipzig in 1537 by Hans Müller, and a trumpet from 1461. We found most
interesting the small ancient Greek and Roman collection including a few
actual instruments and a number of objects depicting musical scenes. If
you’re a fan of musical instruments, schedule at least an hour for your
visit.
See map p. 142. Piazza Santa Croce in Gerusalemme 9a, left of the church. % 06-
7014796. www.museostrumentimusicali.it. Metro: A to San Giovanni. Bus:

Open: Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m. Ticket booth closes 30 minutes earlier. Closed
Jan 1, and Dec 25.
Wax Museum (Museo delle Cere)
Trevi
The third most famous European wax museums (after London’s Madame
Tussaud’s and Paris’s Grevin) opened in 1958. The continually growing 
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 171

collection now includes more than 250 life-sized figures, faithful portraits of
politicians, artists, and athletes complete with perfectly manufactured
clothing (particularly impressive in the historical figures). Some are dis-
played in perfectly reconstructed situations, including furnishings and audi-
ence. In addition to people, the collection includes a section on capital
punishment; the best-known instruments of execution have been repro-
duced with care. Well suited for young visitors is the children’s section,
where the display includes scale reproductions of dinosaur species, as well
as favorite fairy tale characters such as Sleeping Beauty and Snow White.

For serious antiquity lovers
Rome was the cradle of the Roman Empire, and mementoes from the
ancient civilization in various levels of repair are everywhere. Ruins are
so numerous that you would need months to explore them all. In addi-
tion to the “biggies” we list in the first part of this chapter, here are some
must-see destinations and personal favorites. If you’re interested in
archaeology and the ancient world, one good way to get a general
overview and to move from one attraction to the other is to use the
Archeobus (see “Seeing Rome by Guided Tour,” later in this chapter).
Appian Way Archaeological Park (Parco 
Archeologico dell’Appia Antica)
This beautiful park starts beyond the Caracalla Baths, near the Aventino,
and stretches for several miles to the south. Here you can walk over an
original section of what the ancient Romans called the Regina Viarum
(Queen of Roads). Started in 312 B.C. as the highway to Capua, this was
the first and most important Roman consular road, which was progres-
sively extended to reach Benevento (233km/146 miles to the southeast),
then Taranto (an extra 281km/176 miles), and finally Brindisi (another
70km/40 miles), at the tip of the Italian peninsula. It was on this road that
St. Peter, in flight from Rome, had his vision of Jesus (a church stands
where Peter asked, “Domine quo vadis?” or “Lord, where am I going?”) and
turned back toward his martyrdom. The street is still paved with the origi-
nal large, flat basalt stones and lined with the remains of villas, tombs, and
monuments against the background of the beautiful countryside. Besides
the Catacombs of St. Callixtus (see listing earlier in this chapter), we think
the most interesting attractions in the park are the Mausoleum of Cecilia
Metella (Via Appia Antica 161), a first century B.C. gentlewoman whose
mausoleum was integrated into the fortification of a medieval castle, and
the impressive Villa of the Quintili (see listing later in this section).
Another interesting archaeological attraction is Maxentius Circus, where
you can see the mausoleum and the ruins of the arena built by the
Emperor Maxentius in honor of his son Romulus, as well as the ruins of
the emperor’s residence (Via Appia Antica 153; % 06-7801324; Tues–Sun
winter 9 a.m.–5 p.m., summer 9 a.m.–1 p.m.; admission: 2.60€/$3.40).

It is possible but cumbersome to reach the park by public transportation,
and its attractions lay quite a distance from each other. The best way to
visit this park and its attractions is on the Archeobus (see “Seeing Rome
by Guided Tour,” later in this chapter) or by renting bicycles at the park
visitor center Cartiera Latina (Via Appia Antica 42) or at the Bar Caffe
dell’Appia Antica (Via Appia Antica 175). Bikes rent for 3€ ($3.60) per
hour or 10€ ($13) for the day.

Ara Pacis Augustae
Piazza Navona
This monumental altar (38 ft. × 34.8 ft.) was erected in 9 B.C. to celebrate
the Augustan Peace. By securing the frontiers of the empire (particularly
in Spain and Gaul), Augustus established a safe environment for commerce
and cultural exchange that brought the Roman culture to its highest level
of development. The altar is entirely carved in marble, covered with reliefs
of great beauty. Long closed to the public, it is finally visible again thanks
to the completion of the much-debated new architectural enclosure
designed by architect Richard Meier. The result of the expensive, lengthy
project is satisfactory insofar as the new enclosure does protect the mon-
ument and facilitate its enjoyment by visitors, but we are not sure it was
worth the price.

Barracco Museum (Museo Barracco)
Navona/Pantheon
Housed in a 16th-century palazzo, this lesser-known museum displays the
private collection of Baron Giovanni Barracco, which he donated to the
city at his death in 1904. He conceived his collection as a panoramic his-
tory of ancient sculpture, and includes superb examples of Assyro-
Babylonian, Egyptian, Greek, and Roman art. It just reopened after several
years of restoration and is much improved. You’ll need about one and a
half hours for a good visit.

Crypta Balbi
Teatro Marcello
Part of the National Roman Museum, this interesting space shows a slice of
Rome’s history. The archeological excavations have revealed how a cov-
ered portico dating from the first century A.D. was used and changed during
the decline of the Roman Empire and the early Middle Ages. The three-floor
exhibit displays many findings highlighting everyday life during this period,
and you can visit the large archeological area below, walking through the
crypt and the adjacent structures, including an ancient water reservoir.

Admission: 7€/$9.10; admission includes National Roman Museum of Palazzo Altemps,
Palazzo Massimo alle Terme, and Diocletian Baths. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7:45 p.m.;
Dec 24 and 31 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Jan 1 and Dec 25.
Diocletian Baths (Terme di Diocleziano)
Repubblica
This grandiose complex was built between A.D. 298 and 305 and covered a
surface area of almost 1.5 million square feet! If you look at today’s Rome
map, the baths extended from Via Torino to Via Volturno, and from Piazza
dei Cinquecento to Via XX Settembre; this should give you an idea of how
enormous they were. Dismembered by the overlaying of newer structures
through the centuries, they require you to use your imagination to recreate
the grandeur. Piazza della Repubblica covers the imprint of what origi-
nally was the main esedra (semicircular exercise area) at the back of the
complex. The church of Santa Maria degli Angeli (Piazza della Repubblica;
% 06-4880812; free admission) occupies the central monumental halls and
the former tepidarium (warming hall). The church, with its attached

monastery and cloisters, was realized in the 16th century by Michelangelo,
who made a point of conserving much of the original structures. The
church was enlarged and redecorated to its present state by Luigi Vanvitelli
in the 18th century. The monastery, with its beautiful main cloister, today
houses the Museum proper (Viale E. de Nicola 78; % 06-39967700 Mon–Sat

and Cripta Balbi; Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–7:45 p.m.; Dec 24 and 31 9 a.m.–5 p.m.;
closed Jan 1 and Dec 25). The museum exhibits include sculpture and a rich
collection of epigraphy, or inscriptions found in the various archaeological
sites in Rome, mostly carved in stone. The Octagonal Hall (see listing later
in this section) was probably a frigidarium (cooling area). The other sur-
viving structures from the huge bath complex have been integrated in the
other buildings around Piazza della Repubblica, and you can still see bits
and pieces of their walls.
See map p. 142. Piazza della Repubblica. Metro: Line B to Repubblica, Line A and B
to Termini.
Montemartini Annex (Centrale Montemartini)
Testaccio
When the Capitoline Museums’ Palazzo Nuovo was restored, much of the
museums’ Greek and Roman sculpture collection moved to this new site,
the first electrical plant built in Rome, in 1912. An intriguing, beautiful set-
ting for the art collection, it contains over 400 sculptures; among our
favorite pieces are an imposing fifth century B.C. sculptural ensemble
depicting a battle scene between Greeks and Amazons, the elegant
Esquilin Venus tying her hair before bathing, and a huge, splendid mosaic
with hunting scenes (6m × 12m/20 × 40 ft.) recovered from one of the
ancient Roman imperial residences. Plan to spend about an hour here.

Museum of Roman Civilization (Museo della Civiltá Romana)
EUR
Located outside Rome’s historic center (but well connected by public
transportation), this interesting museum focuses on the history of ancient
Rome and the spread of its civilization throughout the world. The big
attraction, and a favorite with kids, is an impressive model of Imperial
Rome, a perfect reconstruction in 1:250 scale of Rome at the time of
Emperor Constantine, measuring 200 sq. m (2,150 sq. ft.), that was 30 years
in the making. You’ll see all the great buildings intact, which will help you
make sense of all the broken columns and holes in the ground elsewhere
around the city. Other models display facets of daily life in antiquity — a
good complement. You can easily spend two hours here.

Octagonal Hall (Aula Ottagona)
Repubblica
Part of the Diocletian Baths (see listing earlier in this section), this is a
beautiful example of ancient Roman architecture, completely preserved,
including its roof. Adapted into a planetarium in 1928, it is now accessible
through a separate entrance from the rest of the complex. Inside is an
important sculpture collection originating from several of Rome’s bath com-
plexes. Famous statues here include the two bronzes, one of a Roman gen-
eral of the second century and another of a sitting fighter of the first
century. A staircase leads to the original level of the floor, under which have
been discovered remains of buildings on which the baths were constructed.

Triumphal Column of Marcus Aurelius 
(Colonna di Marco Aurelio)
Navona/Pantheon
At the center of beautiful Piazza Colonna, this commemorative column is
an imposing sight, 25m (83 ft.) tall and completely decorated with bas-
reliefs. The column was erected in honor of Marcus Aurelius, the enlight-
ened emperor who ruled from A.D. 161 to 180, and the reliefs recount his
exploits in battles against the German tribes. A statue of the emperor once

adorned the top, but in the 16th century, Pope Sixtus V replaced it with
the statue of St. Paul that you see today. The Palazzo Chigi, on one side
of the piazza, is the residence of the Italian prime minister, so don’t be sur-
prised if you see intense guys standing around with submachine guns.
See map p. 142. Piazza Colonna, off Via del Corso at Via del Tritone. Bus: 62, 85, or
Minibus 116, 117, or 119 to Piazza Colonna.
Villa of the Quintili (Villa dei Quintili)
Park of the Appia Antica
Recently opened after lengthy (and ongoing) excavations, this was the
largest private villa in the Roman suburbs. It was the property of the two
brothers Quintili, who were consuls in A.D. 151. The structure was enlarged
when it became the property of the Emperor Commodus, who loved the
quiet and the villa’s thermal baths. For centuries, it was a mine of statuary
for treasure hunters; many of those works are now on display in the great
museums of the world. For its sheer size — it extends between the Appia
Antica and the Appia Nuova — the site is quite impressive; it also affords
beautiful views of the Roman countryside.
See map p. 174. Via Appia Nuova 1092. % 06-39967700 (Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m.
and 2:30–5 p.m.). www.pierreci.it for reservations. www.archeorm.arti.

and Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella. Open: Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–1:30 p.m. and 2:30–5 p.m.
For families with kids
Kids of all ages love imagining lost civilizations and treasure hunts, and
because Rome is essentially one big archaeological site, children will
find much to love about the city. Throughout this chapter, we have used
the Kid Friendly icon to indicate the best attractions for children. Here,
we suggest a few more places and activities that are particularly suited
for children or teens. In addition to our suggestions below, bicycling can
be a great way to enjoy your visit. While riding in Rome’s busy streets
can be dangerous and unpleasant, we recommend taking the bikes to
explore the Tiber banks (see “Boats down the Tiber,” below), Villa
Borghese Park (see listing later in this section), and the Appian Way
Archeological Park (see previous section). The entire family can rent
bikes at each of these places. The city has been promoting recreational
bicycling (as well as walking and jogging) and claims Rome currently
boasts 150 km (90 miles) of bicycle paths. A map of biking and walking
trails is available at www.assessoratoambiente.it.
Boats down the Tiber
San Pietro
Sailing down the Tiber is a wonderful way to experience Rome. The
Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San Angelo (% 06-6789361; www.
battellidiroma.it) operates boat service between Ponte Duca d’Aosta
(right bank) and Isola Tiberina (Calata Anguillara on the right bank), with

Parent Savers
If your kids are getting tired of art and churches and you’ve exhausted our sugges-
tions, here are a few aces in the hole that can be of interest to everybody.
Fire Brigade Museum (Museo dei Vigili del Fuoco): This little-known museum in the
Testaccio area is not very big but is extremely interesting. Its ambitious aim is to detail
the history of firefighting in Rome from antiquity (about the age of Emperor Augustus)
to today. Besides objects and photos, displays include media installations that incor-
porate videos and special optical and sound effects. (Via Marmorata 15; % 06-
5746808; museoromavf@vfdcf.it; Tram: 3; admission: free; Mon–Sat 9–7 p.m.)
Museum of Medicine (Museo Storico dell’Arte Sanitaria): Not far from Castel
Sant’Angelo and St. Peter’s, this unusual museum provides a good break for older kids
and adults. Housed in the working hospital of Santo Spirito, it fills nine separate spaces
with historical collections of surgical instruments (some from ancient Roman and
medieval times), anatomical tables, and paintings. You’ll also visit a typical 17th-cen-
tury pharmacy and chemist-alchemist lab. Some gruesome objects are on display,
including embryos and skeletons illustrating various birth defects. Volunteers lead the
mandatory guided tours; make a reservation. Along one of the exterior walls, look for
the rota, the revolving mechanism where parents could abandon unwanted babies to
the care of the sisters in the hospital. (See map p. 142; Lugotevere in Sassia 3; % 06-
68352353 or 06-6893051; Fax 06-6833485; admission: 3€/$3.90; Mon, Wed, and Fri 
10 a.m.–noon; closed Jan 1, May 1, August, and Dec 25)
Villa Celimontana: On the Celio hill, behind the Golden House of Nero (see listing ear-
lier in this chapter), the grounds of this aristocratic villa have been turned into a public
park. A little island of peace in the bustling center of Rome, it has a couple of play-
grounds where your tots will be delighted to take a break. It also makes an excellent
spot for a quiet family picnic (remember not to litter; you risk heavy fines).
Cat Sanctuary (Torre Argentina): Rome’s stray cats, a favorite subject for photogra-
phers looking for a special perspective on familiar sights, have taken refuge in these
ruins since time immemorial. Here you can meet the furry citizens up close and per-
sonal. A short distance from Piazza Navona and the Ghetto, the sanctuary provides a
unique insight on Rome’s oldest archeological complex, which houses the ruins of four
temples dating to 400–300 B.C. Volunteers founded the nonprofit organization that cares
for the resident felines. You can visit the shelter and make friends with some of the
250 occupants, and pick up a cat-themed present in the gift shop. (Largo di Torre
Argentina, at Via Florida; www.romancats.com.)
Astronomy Museum and Planetarium: In the same building as the Museum of Roman
Civilizations (see listing earlier in this chapter), this theater presents an interesting
show on the solar system. (Piazza Giovanni Agnelli 10; % 06-82077304; admission:
6.20€ ($8), combo ticket with museum: 8.30€/$10.80; Tues–Fri 9 a.m.–2 p.m. and
Sat–Sun 9 a.m.–7 p.m.)

intermediary stops at Ponte Sant’Angelo and Ponte Cavour (by Piazza
Augusto Imperatore). The ride is not only idyllic — far from noise and 
traffic — and fun, but also a convenient and inexpensive means of trans-
portation, provided that you need to go somewhere along the Tiber. Do
not worry if you arrive at a deserted and locked dock. The only staffed
location is the Ponte Sant’Angelo, where you’ll find the main reservation
office; all the other docks are opened by the boat crew when they arrive.
Schedules are posted on a board outside and on the Web site.
A recent offering combines the boat ride with a bicycle rental, allowing
you to go by boat and bike back along the banks; you can rent the bike at
Isola Tiberina and bring it on the boat with you, and then ride back
(Bike&Boat; % 06-45495816 or 346-0114697). The best stretch is between
Isola Tiberina and Ponte Cavour (a 35-minute ride); while the next leg is a
more boring 25-minute ride to Ponte Duca d’Aosta. Ponte Cavour is in the
heart of the historic center, but Ponte d’Aosta has little tourist appeal.
From there your best bet is to bicycle back, take a bus back, or pay again
for the return trip by boat.
The same company also organizes special boat tours (see “Seeing Rome by
Guided Tour,” later in this chapter), including a wonderful cruise to Ostia
Antica, which allows you to get to Rome’s ancient seaport in much the
same way as the ancient Romans (see Chapter 14).
See map p. 142. Ponte Sant’Angelo, across Castel Sant’Angelo (dock is on the 
left bank of the Tiber). % 06-6789361 for info and reservations. E-mail: info@
battellidiroma.it. Fare: Single trip Mon–Fri 4 p.m. 1€ ($1.30) and Fri–Sun 
4 p.m. 3€ ($3.90); single trip plus bicycle rental for the day Mon–Fri 4 p.m. 12€ ($16)
and Fri– Sun 4 p.m. 15€ ($20); lower fares for shorter rentals.
Capuchin Cemetery (Cimitero dei Cappuccini)
Via Veneto
In the crypt of the Chiesa dell’Immacolata Concezione is a fascinating, if
ghoulish, sight. A Capuchin monk used the bones of some 3,700 of his
brothers to create a monument that reminds us — literally — that “in the
midst of life, we are in the midst of death.” Skeletal pieces decorate the
ceilings and walls of five underground chapels, creating interesting pat-
terns and designs (for example, rows of spinal vertebrae trace the vaults,
while other bones make chandeliers and frame niches displaying robed
skeletons). Note: This may be a “kid-friendly” sight if you have a teenager,
but it would disturb and frighten smaller children.

eral roller coasters, including one of the largest in the world, and its giant

Puppet Shows
Trastevere and Piazza del Popolo
Only two theaters in Rome still perform this beloved form of entertain-
ment: the traditional Neapolitan puppet show featuring Pulcinella, the
white-dressed masked character of the Commedia dell’Arte. Performances
are in Italian, but you don’t really need to understand the dialogue to laugh
at Pulcinella bashing the gendarme on his head or doing other silly tricks.
The most traditional show is at the Teatrino delle Marionette on the
Janiculum Hill. The theater is open-air, with a few folding chairs in front of
the wooden theater. Shows are canceled in bad weather, and during the
week, reservations are required. If you haven’t reserved, the weekend is
your best bet. The other shows are presented in the newly renovated
Teatrino dei Burattini San Carlino, a real theater (with sheltered sitting
area) in the Pincio Gardens (see listing later in this chapter), presenting a
variety of puppet shows. Reservations are required.
See map p. 142. Janiculum Hill: Teatrino delle Marionette, Piazza Garibaldi. % 06-

Time Elevator
Trevi
Here is where you come to experience ancient and Renaissance Rome in
5D (tridimensional images plus multisensory effects and motion simula-
tion). The 45-minute show takes you through virtual reconstructions of
historical moments (such as the legend of Romulus and Remus and the
assassination of Caesar) and monuments (Colosseum, Caracalla Baths,
Sistine Chapel, and so on), some of which are rather well made. Two other
shows are offered: Escape to Bane Manor is a horror show in a haunted
house, and Ode to Life takes you back to the big bang and has you running
with dinosaurs and primitive men. Shows are offered in six languages
(through individual Dolby stereo headsets) and you can ask for a static
seat if you are not keen on the full effect or suffer from motion sickness.
Children less than 1m (3.28 ft.) tall are not admitted.

Villa Borghese Park
Piazza del Popolo
Just steps from Piazza del Popolo, extending north beyond the city walls,
is one of Rome’s most beautiful parks. It formerly belonged to the aristo-
cratic Borghese family, who donated it to the city. Famous for the
Borghese Gallery (see listing earlier in this chapter), it is beloved by
Romans, who come here to enjoy the greenery on weekends, especially in
summer, when the beautiful Roman pines offer relief from the heat. Inside
the park you’ll find several attractions, including Piazza di Siena, a pic-
turesque oval track surrounded by tall pines, used for horse races and par-
ticularly for the Concorso Ippico Internazionale di Roma (Rome’s official
international show-jumping competition), held in May (see Chapter 3).
Overlooking Piazza di Siena is Raphael’s Pavillion (Casino di Raffaello),
housing a children’s museum with playrooms (free of charge) and activi-
ties (3€/$3.90; by reservation only at the number below) for visitors ages
three to ten (% 06-82059127; www.casinadiraffaello.it; Tues–Sun 9

Going the opposite direction, to the north, you’ll find the romantic Lake
Gardens (the Laghetto) around an artificial lake where you can rent a row-
boat (the lake is full of turtles; try to spot one). If you want to take advan-
tage of the long bicycle trails, you can rent bikes for the entire family as

Zoo (Bioparco)
Villa Borghese
Adjoining Villa Borghese Park (see previous listing) to the north, Rome’s
zoo is very special. Inaugurated in 1911, it was designed following the 
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 181

revolutionary principles of Karl Hagenbeck, the German expert who advo-
cated the use of natural barriers instead of iron cages to keep animals sepa-
rated from each other — and from the visitors. Visually more attractive
than regular zoos, these zoos are not necessarily less stressful for the ani-
mals, because the space allotted to each of them is small. The zoo has
been reorganized according to newer concepts, drastically reducing the
number of species and changing its focus on scientific observation and
teaching. Today about 1,000 animals (72 species of mammals, 92 birds, and
54 reptiles), live on the park’s 17 hectares (42 acres), including a few mem-
bers of protected species. The zoo doubles as a botanical garden; you’ll
also find a restaurant, bar, and picnic areas inside, and a small motor train
for rides.

For religious-architecture lovers: More great churches
Rome counts 913 churches just in the historic center, ranging from the
8th to the 18th century (many have even older cores). All are lavishly
decorated with masterpieces by the dominant artists of the period, and
most deserve a visit. We had room to review only a couple in the previ-
ous section, but we feel many more deserve to share the top range. You
would need years of dedication to achieve the ambitious task of visiting
all of them, but here is our selection of the ones you would really regret
not seeing.
St. Mary in Cosmedin and Mouth of Truth (Santa Maria 
in Cosmedin and Bocca della Verità)
Aventino
This Orthodox church is very pretty inside and outside — it’s one of the
few Roman churches to have escaped baroque “restoration” — but the
real attraction is the famous Roman marble carving lying against a wall
under its outer porch. The Bocca della Verità (Mouth of Truth), a round
marble piece with the relief of a head with an open mouth, in all likelihood
was an ancient Roman manhole cover. Associated with it is a legend that
has made it famous: It is said that if you put your hand inside the mouth
while lying, it will bite it off. (Remember the scene with Gregory Peck and
Audrey Hepburn from Roman Holiday?) Kids get a kick out of putting their
hands in the mouth while naughty parents ask tricky questions. Besides,
it is a beautiful piece of carving (I wish manhole covers were still so made),
and Piazza Bocca della Verità, where the church is located, is one of the
nicest squares in town. It’s at its best during off hours due to the traffic.
Two small Roman temples still stand here: The round one is believed to
be dedicated to the goddess Vesta, and the other to the twins of Greek
mythology, Castor and Pollux.

Open: Daily 7 a.m.–6:30 p.m.
St. Paul’s Basilica (Basilica di San Paolo Fuori Le Mura)
San Paolo
This basilica, second in size and artistic importance only to St. Peter’s, was
built well outside the city walls in what was then the countryside, along the
road that leads from Rome to the ancient Roman seaport of Ostia (Via
Ostiense). San Paolo is now a modern neighborhood of Rome, well con-
nected to the city center by public transportation. According to tradition,
the body of St. Paul was buried here after his martyrdom. As early as the
time of Emperor Constantine in the fourth century A.D., a church was built
around St. Paul’s tomb (still below the high altar). Consecrated in A.D. 324,
the basilica was vastly enlarged over the centuries, but it was almost com-
pletely destroyed by fire in 1823. Rebuilt with marble salvaged from the orig-
inal structure, its apse and triumphal arch are original, while the mosaic in
the apse is a faithful copy of the 13th-century work, reconstructed with what
was salvaged from the fire. The ciborium over the altar — a 1285 master-
piece by Arnolfo di Cambio — miraculously escaped the fire. Under the altar
is the sepulcher of St. Paul, the tomb containing the saint’s remains; it’s
accessible by a staircase. The basilica’s interior is vast and impressive, its
naves divided by 80 granite columns; the windows may look like stained
glass, but they’re actually made of translucent alabaster. Our favorite part
is the adjacent original cloister, and you’d have to go to Sicily to find such
distinctively carved and decorated columns of so many diverse patterns.

Free. Open: Church daily 7 a.m.–6:30 p.m.; cloister daily 9 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–6 p.m.
St. Peter in Chains (San Pietro in Vincoli)
Colosseo
This church is named after the two sets of chains, on display in a bronze
urn in the crypt, that held St. Peter in Jerusalem and, later, in Rome.
According to Catholic Church legend, the chains were miraculously
welded together when they touched each other in this church. The 19th-
century makeover hides the actual age of this church, which was built in
A.D. 439 over an even older church. The 18th- and 19th-century interior
decorations may leave you unmoved, and so might the religious relics, but
you should not miss the star of the show. Inside, look for a majestic funeral
monument. It was designed by Michelangelo for Pope Julius II and is
graced by one of his most famous masterpieces, his Moses. The monu-
ment and the church’s charming location are reason enough to visit.

Santa Maria in Aracoeli
Teatro Marcello
Next to Piazza del Campidoglio and off Piazza Venezia, Santa Maria
d’Aracoeli is a scenic church standing at the top of a soaring flight of steps
(this is the only drawback to a visit: you’ll have to climb). One of few sur-
viving medieval churches in Rome, it dates from 1250 and stands on the
site of an ancient Roman temple. Two carved rose windows punctuate the
austere exterior; inside you’ll be rewarded by several works of art. The
floor is an excellent example of Cosmati marblework (the Cosmati were a
family of Roman master stone artists whose signature mosaic marble
floors were imitated all over Italy; they worked during the 12th and 13th
centuries). Other masterpieces await you in the Bufalini Chapel, lavishly
decorated with Pinturicchio’s frescoes, depicting scenes from the life of St.
Bernardino of Siena and St. Francis receiving the stigmata.
See map p. 142. Piazza d’Aracoeli. % 06-6798155. Bus: Minibus 117 to Campidoglio;
then walk to the right around the Vittorio Emanuele II Monument. Admission: Free.
Open: Daily 7 a.m. to noon and 4–7 p.m.
Santa Maria in Trastevere
Trastevere
Opening on a square graced by an early baroque fountain, this is believed
to be the first church officially opened to the public in Rome, making it the
first Roman Catholic church in the world. Its age and the uniqueness of
the artwork conserved inside make it one of a kind. Founded by Pope Saint
Callixtus in the third century A.D., it was enlarged and given its present look
in the 12th century with materials from the Caracalla Baths (see listing ear-
lier in this chapter). The facade is decorated with its original mosaic, while
the portico is a later, baroque addition. Inside, take time to admire the
Cosmatesque floor (see previous listing), as well as the richly decorated
wooden ceiling (designed by Domenichino in the 17th century). But then
you should dedicate your undivided attention to the unique and beauti-
fully preserved mosaics decorating the apse. And let your eyes wander
over the main altar: they’ll find the Madonna della Clemenza, a unique
painting from the sixth century.

A pocketful of change
In Roman churches, the precious frescoes and fragile paintings are usually kept in
semi-obscurity, but you don’t need to squint to see them. Look for the light box usually
positioned on the wall nearby: When you insert a coin or two, a light pops on to illu-
minate the painting, fresco, or sculpture for a limited amount of time. Before visiting
churches, make sure you have a pocketful of coins; it will make a world of difference.

Santa Maria Maggiore
Repubblica
This church’s history stretches back 1,600 years, and though it has under-
gone many changes over the centuries, Santa Maria Maggiore remains one
of the city’s four great basilicas. Commissioned by Pope Sisto III, it was
built as a sanctuary for Mary (mother of Jesus) and was originally referred
to as Santa Maria della Neve (St. Mary of the Snow) because its outline was
drawn in the snow that had miraculously fallen in the summer of A.D. 352.
The baroque facade was designed by Ferdinando Fuga, who sandwiched
it between two palaces that had been built in the meantime (one in the
17th and the other in the 18th century). It holds a treasure trove of origi-
nal masterpieces, starting from the unique mosaics on the apse and side
walls. The floors are also original from the 12th century: another of the
few existing examples of original Cosmati marblework (see Santa Maria
d’Aracoeli listing, above). The 15th-century coffered wooden ceiling is
richly decorated with gold (said to be the first gold brought back from the
New World and donated by the Spanish queen). One of the church’s main
attractions is in the loggia, shading the 13th-century mosaics preserved
from the old facade. Also, inside, look carefully to the right side of the altar
for the tomb of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Italy’s most important baroque
sculptor-architect. In the crypt are relics of what are said to be pieces of
Jesus’ crib. Inside the church is a little-known architectural masterpiece
by Michelangelo (he designed but did not complete it), the Cappella
Sforza; the small space is elegantly decorated and artificially enlarged by
the clever disposition of its angular columns.

walk south on Via Cavour. Bus: 70. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 7 a.m.–7 p.m.
Santa Maria sopra Minerva
Pantheon
The construction of this church started in the eighth century A.D. on the
foundation of an ancient temple to Minerva, goddess of wisdom. The pres-
ent structure, with its elegant pointed arches and blue starred ceiling, dates
from 1280, making it the only Gothic church in Rome. You wouldn’t know
that from the facade, redone, as were so many other churches in Rome, in
the 17th century. Inside are many treasures, including Michelangelo’s
Cristo Portacroce in the presbytery, as well as frescoes by Filippino Lippi
in the Carafa Chapel. The church also houses a great number of tombs,
including the painter Fra Angelico’s. Under the altar are the relics of St.
Catherine of Siena. On the square in front of the church is the much-pho-
tographed elephant sculpture that serves as the base for a sixth-century
B.C. Egyptian obelisk; conceived by Bernini, the sculpture was executed by
somebody else.

Santa Prassede
Repubblica
Another of Rome’s very old churches, Santa Prassede was built before the
fifth century A.D. and restored in the Middle Ages. Today’s entrance dates
to that time. Almost nondescript from the outside, inside it abounds with
Byzantine mosaics, lining the arch over the main altar, the apse, and the
entire chapel of San Zenone. This unique chapel is considered Rome’s
most important Byzantine monument. The church is full of other works of
art, including a bust of Bishop G. B. Santoni from 1614, an early work by
Gian Lorenzo Bernini (located by the third column to the right of the
main nave).

For secular-architecture lovers: More delightful
Roman piazze and palaces
From the Renaissance onward, master architects worked to redesign the
Eternal City to match its looks with its destiny. The results were often
spectacular and always unique. Here is our roster of the best architec-
tural jewels in Rome and of some unique monuments, besides those 
previously listed.
Campo de’ Fiori
Campo de’ Fiori
Surrounded by cafes, restaurants, and bars, the lovely square of Campo de’
Fiori boasts many attractions. Its fruit-and-vegetable market is one of the
city’s best and certainly one of the liveliest. Though popular with working
people as a lunch spot, the campo is even hotter with young people (both
Romans and foreigners) at night. The central statue of the hooded
Giordano Bruno hints at the more sinister parts of the campo’s history —
it was the site of executions in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and
Bruno was burned at the stake here in 1600. Bruno was a philosopher who
championed the ideas of such early scientists as Copernicus and main-
tained such heretical ideas as that of the Earth revolving around the sun.

Janiculum Hill (Passeggiata del Gianicolo)
Trastevere
Head up the Janiculum hill rising above Trastevere and St. Peter’s for the
best panorama in Rome: the view is breathtaking at any hour, and you’ll
also find other entertainment. You can have a break at the kiosk bar and
your kids can enjoy the merry-go-round and a traditional Neapolitan
puppet show (see listing earlier in this chapter). The promenade deserves
its fame as the best overlook on Rome (the other famous one, from the
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
186

Pincio Gardens, is considered the most romantic; see listing later in this
chapter). On the hill is a park graced by a large fountain, a monument to
Giuseppe Garibaldi — perhaps the most beloved figure of the 19th-century
Italian struggle for self-determination — and a unique equestrian statue of
his wife, Anita, likewise a hard-charging revolutionary. Anita’s tomb is under
the statue. A small kiosk bar offers refreshments throughout the year. During
the summer Estate Romana festival (see Chapters 3 and 16), a cocktail bar
offers drinks and seafood dinners (www.fontanonedelgianicolo.it).
See map p. 142. Bus: 119, or take a cab up and stroll down.
Monument to King Vittorio Emanuele II 
(Vittoriano aka Altare della Patria)
Colosseo
This controversial monument — called “the typewriter” by detractors
because of its shape — was built to honor the memory of the first king of
Italy, who unified the country. The construction, from 1885 to 1911,
employed the most talented Italian artists of the time. Since 1921, it has
also housed the Tomba del Milite Ignoto (Tomb of the Unknown
Soldier). Closed to the public for decades, it has been completely restored,
and it is now possible to admire the beautiful decorations. Also, you can
climb the stairs and enjoy one of the most beautiful views over Rome, par-
ticularly at sunset. The lower floors house excellent art exhibits; check
with the tourist office for the current schedule.

Non-Catholic Cemetery (Cimitero Acattolico)
Testaccio
A pilgrimage site for fans of poets John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley,
who are buried here, this is a very pretty small cemetery. Among other
famous eternal occupants is the anti-Fascist Antonio Gramsci, who died in
1937 after 11 years in prison. The cemetery has a prestigious next-door
neighbor: the pyramid of Caius Cestius, a Roman praetor and tribune who
died in 12 B.C.

Piazza del Popolo
Piazza del Popolo
The “piazza of the people” lives up to its name: Romans like to meet here
to talk, have a drink, hang out, and people-watch. You can do the same,
though be warned that the two cafes fronting the piazza gouge you unmer-
cifully if you sit at an outdoor table (or even an indoor one) instead of
taking your coffee at the counter like a Roman. Santa Maria del Popolo
(% 06-3610836) stands by the gate leading out to busy Piazzale Flaminio
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 187

(where you can catch lots of buses). Founded in 1099, the church contains
magnificent Caravaggios as well as a Pinturicchio. The brace of baroque
churches directly across the square are the work of Carlo Rainaldi, Bernini,
and Carlo Fontana. In the center is an Egyptian obelisk, one of Rome’s
most ancient objects, dating from 1200 B.C. It came from Heliopolis and had
been placed there by Ramses II, but was brought to Rome during
Augustus’s reign (it stood in the Circo Massimo until one of the popes, in
their nearly endless reshuffling and meddling with monuments, moved it
here). When you leave the piazza, head up the steps into the trees on the
east side. This path leads to the Pincio Gardens, one of the best places to
see the sun set over Rome (see listing later in this chapter).

Piazza del Quirinale and Palazzo del Quirinale
Trevi
Now the home of Italy’s president, the Palazzo del Quirinale was the resi-
dence of the king up till the end of World War II. Earlier in history, the pope
lived here — or hid, in the case of Pius VII, who locked himself in after
excommunicating Napoleon (it didn’t help: soldiers broke in and carted
him off to Fontainebleau). The royal family of Savoy substituted some
gaudy, second-rate 19th-century art for earlier decoration, but the palace
is still impressive and has some spectacular rooms. The private gardens
enclosed by the palace are gorgeous, especially in spring. Note: Bring your
passport — you’ll need to pass through an identity and security check to
enter.
On the square, the fountain (Fontana di Monte Cavallo) has two giant stat-
ues of Castor and Pollux, the twin sons of Leda and Zeus. The Egyptian
obelisk adorning the square was taken from the Mausoleum of Augustus
by Pius VI in 1793. Across from the palace’s entrance on the same side of
the square are the smaller buildings that were the Scuderie del Quirinale
(Palace Stables), today the setting of many fine-art exhibits (check with
the tourist office for the current schedule).

Piazza Farnese
Campo de’ Fiori
This delightful piazza is dominated by the Palazzo Farnese, surely one of
Rome’s most dramatic buildings, designed by Sangallo and Michelangelo.
A cleaning completed in 1999 turned its somber gray a startling pale yellow
and brought out the delicate decorations. Currently home to the French

Pincio Gardens
Piazza del Popolo
Famous for the terrace overlooking Piazza del Popolo, which is maybe the
most romantic spot in Rome, these gardens offer more than a good
panorama (particularly striking at sunset, we warmly recommend it).
Wanted by Napoleon during his brief occupation of Rome as a public prom-
enade, the gardens were actually created by the architect Giuseppe
Valadier for Pope Pius VII, after Napoleon’s demise. Connected to Villa
Borghese Park (see later in this chapter) by an overpass over the fourth-
century Aurelian city walls, and the embankment, they can also be directly
accessed from Piazza del Popolo, through a steep ascent. Statues and foun-
tains adorn the alleys, including the famous 1867 water clock (Viale
dell’Orologio, on the left of the garden). By the terrace you’ll find a merry-
go-round, much appreciated by young visitors. You’ll also find places, one
on Viale Medici and one on Viale dell’Orologio, where you can rent wheels
and proceed to Villa Borghese.

Villa Farnesina
Trastevere
Not exactly a picture gallery, this gorgeous villa holds a wonderful collec-
tion of frescoes by Raphael and other artists in a suite of rooms. Built
along the Tiber in the early 16th century by the architect Baldassarre
Peruzzi — who also decorated part of the interior with frescoes — and
surrounded by a pleasant garden, it is a splendid example of Roman archi-
tecture. It was unfortunately mutilated in 1884 when the Lungotevere (the
riverside road) was built, destroying part of the gardens and a loggia over-
looking the river that was probably designed by Raphael. The villa was
built for the Chigi family; later it passed to the Farnese, and today it’s the
seat of the Accademia dei Lincei, a major Italian cultural institute, and of
the National Print Gallery, the largest print collection in Italy. The frescoes
in the first room — the Loggia di Psiche — were done by Raphael’s assis-
tants from cartoons by the master, whereas the great fresco of Galatea in
the Sala di Galatea is by Raphael himself. The Camera da Letto on the
second floor was frescoed by Sienese artist Il Sodoma.

Villa Torlonia
Porta Pia
The Torlonia were — and are — a noble Roman family (no less than princes),
and this was their family residence until the early 20th century, when they
donated the entire villa and the surrounding park to the city. The beautiful
grounds are a popular place for Romans to exercise, meet, and relax, but
the main attraction is the buildings, which have been masterfully restored
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 189

over the years. The main building is the most recently refurbished (it
opened to the public in 2006), the Casino Nobile. The elegant villa, which
houses a collection of precious objects, is notable for the architecture and
decoration created by Giuseppe Valadier in the early 19th century. The
luxury and beauty inside will make you long for that bygone era. Nearby is
the Casina delle Civette (Cottage of the Owls), an Art Nouveau jewel with
whimsical architecture and beautiful stained-glass windows. In the 19th cen-
tury, the prince allowed his artistic son to build this cottage as a bachelor
apartment; it now houses an interesting museum of Art Nouveau glasswork.
On the other side of the park is the Casino dei Principi (Cottage of the
Princes), an elegant outbuilding that was the residence of Mussolini when
he was in power and that now preserves some of the collected artworks of
the Torlonia family. You can make a reservation for a guided tour of the
Casina delle Civette, which we recommend.

Seeing Rome by Guided Tour
The French author Stendhal once wrote, “As soon as you enter Rome,
get in a carriage and ask to be brought to the Coliseum [sic] or to St.
Peter’s. If you try to get there on foot, you will never arrive: Too many
marvelous things will stop you along the way.”
Taking a bus tour of this complicated city when you first arrive still is an
excellent idea. Doing so helps you get the feel of the place and gives you
an idea of what you’d like to see in depth later. If one area in particular
appeals to you, take a walking tour, a particularly efficient way to dis-
cover most of what there is to know on a specific place.
Bus tours
We like the hop-on/hop-off formula because of its flexibility: You can take
a complete tour and get an idea of what’s where and what it looks like,
and then start again and visit the various stops. The following tours
operate daily, year-round.
Rome’s public transportation authority, ATAC, gives the best bus tours
of Rome (% 06-46952252 daily 8 a.m.–8 p.m. for reservations and info;
www.trambus.com/servizituristici.htm). You can find cheaper
operators, but you can’t beat the quality or the options. The tours are
offered daily, the buses are new (open-deck vehicles progressively being
equipped with lifts allowing wheelchair accessibility to the open top
deck), and the guides are kind and professional. Tickets can be pur-
chased online, or on the bus with exact change. Each of the three lines
covers a two-hour itinerary.

 The red tourist line 110 “open” buses leave from Piazza dei
Cinquecento in front of Stazione Termini every 10 minutes from
8:40 a.m. to 7:40 p.m. for an 11-stop loop around Rome’s major 
historic sights (16€/$21 adult; 7€/$9.10 child under 13; children
under 6 ride free).
 The Archeobus tour crosses Rome’s historic center and heads for
the Appian Way Archeological Park, making 15 stops near historic
sites of ancient Rome. The green buses leave from Piazza dei
Cinquecento across from Stazione Termini every 40 minutes
between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. (10€/$13, 8€/$10.40 for those with Roma
Pass [see beginning of this chapter]).
 Roma Cristiana is a two-line package offered in cooperation with
the Roman Pilgrim Association (OPR) that takes in all the major
religious sites in Rome and more. Because churches and other reli-
gious sites are scattered throughout Rome, this is an excellent
choice. The yellow buses leave every 25 minutes for the St. Peter’s
loop (19 stops), every 50 minutes for the St. Paul’s Basilica loop (22
stops). Both loops start from Via della Conciliazione, across from
St. Peter’s. They operate between 8:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. Tickets
cost 15€ ($20) for one day and one line, 20€ ($26) for two and two.
If you prefer a more traditional bus tour, several formulas are available.
Tours usually depart around 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 8 p.m. — with possible
pickup from your hotel included — and cost about 28€ ($36) for a three-
hour tour. Here are the three best operators: Appian Line (Piazza
dell’Esquilino 6; % 06-487861; www.appianline.it), Green Line (Via
Farini 5/A; % 06-483787; www.greenlinetours.com), and Vastours (Via
Piemonte 34; % 06-4814309; www.vastours.it). They also offer side
trips from Rome.
Walking tours
Enjoy Rome (Via Varese 39, 3 blocks north off the side of Stazione
Termini; % 06-4451843; www.enjoyrome.com; Metro: Termini) offers a
variety of three-hour walking tours, including a night tour that takes you
through the historic center and its sights, and a tour of Trastevere and
the Jewish Ghetto. Most tours cost 24€ ($31) adults and 18€ ($23) for
those under age 26, including the cost of the tour and admission to
sights. The office is open Monday through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.
and 3:30 to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., and you can
book on the Web site anytime. Enjoy Rome also organizes a bike tour
with English-speaking guides. Reserve at least two weeks in advance,
and you can arrange special-interest tours such as “Fascist Rome: The
Urban Planning of Mussolini” and “Caravaggio in Rome” (prices quoted
upon request).
Boat tours
Besides its regular boat service on the Tiber (see “Finding More Cool
Things to See and Do,” earlier in this chapter), the Compagnia di
Chapter 11: Discovering Rome’s Best Attractions 191

Navigazione Ponte San Angelo (% 06-6789361; www.battellidiroma.
it) offers a number of day cruises on the river. The one-hour tour 
with audio guide costs 12€ ($16) and leaves from Ponte Sant’Angelo
Wednesday through Sunday at 11 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 4 p.m., and 5:30 p.m.;
the dinner cruise includes dinner and a two-hour ride for 54€ ($70), 
with boats leaving from Ponte Sant’Angelo Thursday through Saturday 
at 9 p.m.
Our personal favorite is the cruise down the river to the Tiber mouth,
which includes a two-hour stop at Ostia Antica to visit the archaeologi-
cal area. Boats leave from the Marconi bridge daily in summer and
Friday through Sunday in winter at 10 a.m. and arrive at Ostia at noon;
they depart from Ostia at 2 p.m. for scheduled arrival in Rome at 4:30
p.m., but you can take a faster subway ride back if you wish to spend
more time at the ruins. Tickets cost 12€ ($16) one-way and 13€ ($17)
round-trip.
Air tours
Seeing Rome from a small aircraft is a pricey but unique experience.
Daily tours with Cityfly (Aeroporto dell’Urbe, Via Salaria 825; % 06-
88333; www.cityfly.com) cost 70€ ($91) per adult and 49€ ($64) for
children under 10. The planes fly at an altitude of about 450m (1,476 ft.)
and can take between three and nine passengers for the 20-minute flight.
Make reservations at least two days in advance; the minimum is two per-
sons. A city train serves the airport (the Monterotondo-Mentana line,
departing from Ostinese or Tiburtina stations, to the Salaria-Urbe stop),
but a taxi is a lot less cumbersome.

Chapter 12
Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Browsing the best shopping areas
 Hunting for Roman specialties
 Searching out open-air markets
A
lot of people say Rome isn’t good for shopping, at least not com-
pared with Florence and Italy’s fashion capital, Milan. Well, we beg
to disagree. You’ll find a huge array of goods for sale here in the capital
city and a selection of some items — antique prints, for instance — that
other Italian cities cannot match. You’ll also find bargains here when you
know where to look, and you’ll have a great time browsing in the process!
Surveying the Scene
Italy’s largest city, Rome is full of elegant, fashionable shops where 
you can find many interesting things at prices that often beat those in
Florence and Milan. Some of the best buys include leather goods (bags,
shoes, and clothing), apparel (from moderately elegant to haute cou-
ture), and housewares — from designer furniture and gadgets to linens.
All the big names of Italian fashion and design have showrooms here,
and you’ll find great discounts during the official sales period (see
details later in this section). Children’s clothes deserve special mention:
Rome is one of the few places where you can still find delightfully
embroidered and handmade items — very special but usually pricey —
as well as showrooms of local designers specializing in kids’ fashion.
Rome was also once the center of a large artisan community, but here as
elsewhere, many historic trades have been lost. In terms of crafts, the
city isn’t as rich as it was in ages past. Alas, very few workshops still
practice traditional arts, but those that do produce high-quality work,
particularly gold, plaster and marble work, embroidery, stationery,
and religious art. Also, because this is the capital city, you can find
showrooms selling high-end items from all the traditional crafts and spe-
cialty work from around the country. You can shop for famous products
from places that you may not have time to visit, such as Florentine
embroideries and stationery, Venetian glass and Murano chandeliers,
and Sicilian pottery and ceramic.

Rome is a center for the arts. If you had a euro for every picture that’s
been drawn of the Forum, you would be rich enough to buy your own
Roman villa. Rome has been a magnet for artists for centuries, and it is a
great place to buy art, both old and modern. Rome is also the best place
in Italy to find both antique prints and modern, high-quality prints from
antique plates.
Shopping hours are generally 9 or 9:30 a.m. (later for boutiques, which
may open as late as 10:30 or 11 a.m.) to about 1 or 1:30 p.m. and then from
3:30 or 4 p.m. to 7:30 or 8 p.m. Shops close Monday morning, except for
food and technical shops, which close Thursday afternoon in winter and
Saturday afternoon in summer. All close Sunday. In the historical district,
however, quite a few shops stay open during the lunchtime break and on
Sunday. Most shops observe a seasonal closing for two weeks in August
(generally around the 15th), and some close for the entire month.
Seasonal sales fall during official dates set by the municipal office.
Winter sales last about one month, from the second week of January into
February, while summer sales last about one month around July. This is
a great time for shopping, but you’ll hardly be alone. If you want to
attempt the sales, be there early.
Italy’s value-added tax (known as the IVA) is a steep 19 percent, but 
you can get a refund for purchases costing more than 155€ ($178). This
means that if you spend that much or more with one merchant, regard-
less of the number of items — three pairs of shoes, or five shirts, or
whatever — you can get the rebate. If you buy the three pairs of shoes at
three different stores, however, even if they add up to 155€, that doesn’t
help you, because they’re three different purchases.
All quoted prices include value-added tax. Stores displaying a “TAX FREE”
insignia can give you an invoice that you can cash at the airport’s Customs
office as you leave Italy. Otherwise, you have to take the invoice from the
store, have it stamped at the airport by Customs, and then mail it back to
the store, which will send you a check or credit your charge account.
When shopping for clothes or shoes, keep in mind that Italian sizes are dif-
ferent from those in the United States. Always try things on, because there
is quite a bit of variability by brand. Sizes usually tend to run small com-
pared to U.S. sizes, but not always. Use Table 12-1 to find your Italian size.

Checking Out the Department Stores
Italians are not as big on department stores as Americans are. In Rome,
you’ll find only three major ones, with a number of locations scattered
around the city.
 La Rinascente is an elegant store carrying mainly clothes and
accessories, with a larger selection for women and a smaller one
for children and men. It also carries a nice cosmetics section on 
the ground floor and a smallish housewares selection. It has two
major locations in Rome: Piazza Fiume 1 (% 06-8416081) and
Piazza Colonna (% 06-6784209), both open daily from 9 a.m. 
to 7:30 p.m.
 COIN is another upscale department store, with a trendier and
younger image, carrying a good selection of clothes and acces-
sories for women, men, and children, and some interesting house-
wares. Its major locations are Via dei Gracchi (% 06-36004298);
Piazzale Appio 7, near San Giovanni Basilica (% 06-77250177); 
and Viale Trastevere 60 (% 06-5816036). It’s open daily from 
9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.
 UPIM is a cheaper department store with a good selection of
housewares and a rather inexpensive (and sometimes tacky) line 
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 195

of clothes for women, men, and children, as well as a modest 
selection of toys, stationery, and odds and ends. You’ll find it in Via
del Tritone 172 (% 06-6783336); Piazza di Santa Maria Maggiore
(% 06-4465579); and Via Giovanni Giolitti 10 (% 06-47825909), by
Termini station. All are open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 7:30 p.m.
Going to Market
The most colorful of the food markets — and the most famous in Rome —
is in the lively and picturesque Campo de’ Fiori (Bus: 62 or 64 to Largo
Argentina), where you’ll find fresh fruit and vegetables, fish, meat, cheese,
and cured meats, each sold by specialized vendors. It is surprising that
the market hasn’t become touristy, given the site; the vendors still sell all
kinds of great goodies that Romans eat — from artichokes to anchovies —
at good prices. Another historic food market, and also a great one, is in
Piazza San Cosimato in the heart of Trastevere (Tram: 8), with a great
variety of vendors and excellent quality and prices; it observes the same
hours as Campo de’ Fiori. The noisiest and most exuberant food market
of them all is in Piazza Vittorio, not far from Termini Station, in an area of
Rome that has been taken over by Asian and African immigrants, leading
to an exotic choice of merchandise. In addition to food, you’ll find stands
selling cheap clothes and accessories. All food markets operate Monday
through Saturday from 7 a.m. (some vendors arrive by 6 a.m.) to 2 p.m.
For a truly uproarious market where you’ll see average Romans searching
for every conceivable item, visit the most famous flea market, at Porta
Portese. Extending over several streets in Trastevere, this market is organ-
ized by type of merchandise: antiques, automotive, clothes, textiles, and so
on. You never know what you’re going to find, from oil paintings to fur hats.
It’s a fun place, and you’re likely to find something you like, but go early to
have a good selection before the mobs have picked over the merchandise.
It’s open only on Saturday and Sunday from about 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Another famous but smaller operation is the flea market in Via Sannio
(off Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano), with interesting clothes, acces-
sories, and camping equipment. It’s open daily from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Pickpockets are absolutely dreadful on weekends, when it gets most
crowded. At both flea markets, a small amount of dickering over the
price is usual, so you can practice your bargaining skills.
One more market worth a mention is the antiquarian book and print
market on Piazza Fontanella Borghese in the Navona/Pantheon neigh-
borhood (Bus: 81, or Minibus 117 or 119 to the Corso at Via Tomacelli).
This historic small market is a great place to browse if you know your
stuff, but otherwise, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware).
In these bustling markets, particularly the flea markets, be very aware of
pickpockets, who take advantage of the crowds.

Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
Shopping in Rome is great, if only because of the splendid setting of the
major shopping areas — right in the heart of the city, among Roman
ruins, medieval streets, and Renaissance palaces.
Il Centro
The best shopping area in Rome is in the heart of the historic district, and
precisely in the triangle of medieval and Renaissance streets running
between Piazza del Popolo, Piazza San Silvestro and Largo del Tritone.
Along Via del Corso — the area’s main artery, which is partly restricted
to pedestrians (except for buses and taxis) — you’ll find more affordable
stores selling mostly apparel and shoes. Some are fashionable, some
touristy, others are just trendy, and a few are rather tacky. If you head
for the narrower streets toward Piazza di Spagna, such as Via Frattina,
Via dei Condotti, and Via Babuino, you’ll find the best designer bou-
tiques and all the stars of Italian fashion. Among the Roman designers
are Laura Biagiotti (Via Borgognona 43; % 06-6795040), where you can
always find greatly discounted items from the previous year’s collection;
Renato Balestra (Via Abbruzzi 3; % 06-4882586); Roberto Capucci
(Via Gregoriana 56; % 06-6783600); Raniero Gattinoni (Via Borgognona
22; % 06-6793786); and Mila Schon (Via delle Carrozze 87; % 06-6782408)
for women, and Battistoni (Via dei Condotti 61/a; % 06-697611); Testa
(Via Frattina 104, % 06-6791294); and Brioni (Via Barberini 79; % 06-
484517) for men. Italian designers include Valentino (Via dei Condotti
13; % 06-6739420); Ferragamo (Via dei Condotti 73; % 06-6798402);
Ferragamo Uomo (Via dei Condotti 75; % 06-6781130); Fendi (Via
Borgognona 39; % 06-696661); Gucci (Via dei Condotti 8; % 06-6793888);
Armani (Via dei Condotti 77; % 06-6991460); Emporio Armani (Via del
Babuino 140; % 06-36002197); Gianfranco Ferrè (Piazza di Spagna 70;
% 06-6791451); Versace (Via Borgogna 24; % 06-6795037 and Via Bocca di
Leone; % 06-67800521); Trussardi (Via dei Condotti 49; % 06-6780280);
Prada (Via dei Condotti 88; % 06-6790897; Metro: Line A to Spagna); and
Dominici (Via del Corso 14; % 06-3610591). Most of the time, prices are
so high you may get a nosebleed, but then there are the seasonal sales
(see earlier in this chapter). Next door to the big names, you’ll find more
affordable stores — such the ones selling Italian leather gloves in Piazza
di Spagna — and young designers’ boutiques. For children’s clothes,
you’ll find a branch of La Cicogna (Via Frattina 138; % 06-6786959),
where Roman mums come for all their needs, and, at the other end of
the spectrum, Pinco Pallino (Via del Babuino 115; % 06-69190549), the
showroom of the famous Italian children’s fashion designer who’s par-
ticularly popular in Europe and Asia. Your girls will enjoy visiting Pure
Gold (Via del Babuino 150/d; % 06-3235464), specializing in designer
eveningwear for kids age 5 to 14: lace, satin, sequins, you name it. More
affordable, Zucca Stregata (Via Belsiana 70; % 800-503929) sells cute
blankets, pajamas, slippers, and accessories with signature prints. Hats
are enjoying a comeback, and the historic Borsalino (Piazza del Popolo
20; % 06-32650838) is the right address. If you are interested in jewels,
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 197

Bulgari (Via dei Condotti 10; % 06-696261) is the star of the show, and a
visit to the showroom is a unique experience. Other famous boutiques
include Buccellati (Via dei Condotti 31; % 06-6786784), the Florentine
house whose trademark is designs inspired by Renaissance masters, and
Massoni (Via Margutta 73; % 06-3216916), maybe the oldest jewelry
store in Rome, founded in 1790.
You’ll also find shops specializing in items ranging from stylish Italian
housewares to antiques. C.U.C.I.N.A. (Via Mario de’ Fiori 65; % 06-
6791275) stocks all kinds of usual and unusual kitchenwares. Also try
the small shop attached to the restaurant Gusto (Piazza Augusto
Imperatore 7; % 06-3236363). Via del Babuino and Via Margutta are
the traditional locations of some of the best — and priciest — antiques
shops in town. Among the antiquarian and artwork shops in this area
that merit a mention are Alinari (Via Alibert 16/a; % 06-6792923) and
Fava (Via del Babuino 180, % 06-3610807). Both sell artistic prints, the
former specializing in Roman and the latter in Neapolitan scenes. At
these shops, you can be sure that the antique you’re buying is really an
antique. If books are what you are after, this is also home to some well-
established bookstores carrying titles in English. Libreria per Ragazzi
Mel (Piazza Santi Apostoli 59; % 06-69941045) has a great selection of
children’s books, particularly for readers under 6. The best stops for
both adults and children are Anglo-American Book (Via della Vite 
102; % 06-6795222) and the Lion Bookshop (Via dei Greci 33; % 06-
32654007). If you are looking for paper goods, visit Fabriano (Via del
Babuino 173; % 06-32600361), the showroom of a paper mill in busi-
ness since the 13th century. Finally, at Sermoneta (Via del Tritone 168;
% 06-6795488) and Frette (Via del Corso 381; % 06-6786862, and Piazza
di Spagna 11; % 06-6790673), you’ll find wonderful domestic linens.
Navona/Pantheon
The intricate medieval streets on the west side of the Corso around Piazza
Navona and Piazza della Rotonda (Pantheon) hide a great trove of ele-
gant and original boutiques, and some of the oldest establishments in
Rome. In these smaller shops, you can buy something that you’d never
find at home. Here you’ll find unique, high-quality items — from old prints
to exclusive fashion, from books to antique furniture and toys — made
by small local designers who may be tomorrow’s big names. An elegant
men’s store, Davide Cenci (Via Campo Marzio 1–7; % 06-6990681; Bus:
Minibus 116 to Pantheon), is popular with locals. Just a stone’s throw
away is Tombolini (Via della Maddalena 31/38; % 06-69200342), which
carries handsome clothes and shoes for women and men, with an empha-
sis on classic style. If you really want to make your friends green with
envy, have a pair of shoes custom-made by Listo (Via della Croce 76; 
% 06-6784567). For leather bags and wallets, Bottega Veneta (Piazza
San Lorenzo in Lucina 9; % 06-68210024; Bus: 81, or Minibus 116 to
Piazza San Lorenzo) is famous for its beautiful woven leather designs,
often in rich and startling colors. For casual clothes, seek out the 
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
198

showroom of Replay (Via della Rotonda 21; % 06-6833073), selling jack-
ets, accessories, and jeans; the children’s store is next door. A great place
for children’s clothes is Babe (Via della Palombella 22, % 06-68301975,
right behind the Pantheon), offering a choice of colorful garments, plus
some shoes and toys for small children. Another good address is Bonpoint
Paris (Piazza San Lorenzo in Lucina; % 06-6871548), the showroom of the
exclusive French boutique carrying haute couture clothes for children up
to age 16. Cheaper, but still on the dressy side, is Kid’s Stock (Via Campo
Marzio 37, % 06-6871335), with a large array of outfits for children and
teens. But our favorite shops are probably Marionette (Piazza del Fico 23,
% 06-68210995), near Piazza Navona, where you’ll find hip clothes, acces-
sories, and toys, and the French brand Petit Bateau (Via di Campo Marzio
10/B; % 06-6792348). It sells great underwear and simple but nice clothing
for children up to 8 years old (underwear and pajamas up to age 16).
Local Roman crafts survive here, especially in the medieval area around
Piazza Navona. You can find vimini (basketry) on Via dei Sediari and
Via dei Cestari; ironwork on Via degli Orsini; and even reproductions 
of Roman and Pompeian mosaics at Studio Cassio (Via Urbana 98; % 06-
4745356) and Paola Cucchi (Via Monserrato 49; % 06-6869469). For
beautiful ceramic work, try the Compagnia del Corallo (Via del Corallo
27; % 06-6833697), and for elegant wrought iron, head to Nicola Arduini
(Via degli Specchi 12; % 06-68805537). For plasterwork, including repro-
ductions of antique designs (some objects are small enough to take home;
others can be shipped), visit the Laboratorio Marani (Via Monte Giordano
27; % 06-68307866). For handmade quality jewelry, check out the small
Bottega Mortet (Via dei Portoghesi 18; % 06-6861629), and the large
Ansuini (Corso Vittorio Emanuele II 151 % 06-68806909), established in
1860. Stationery is one of the most popular, portable, and affordable gifts
for the folks back home. For especially refined stationery and paper, go
to Pineider, founded in 1774 (Via Fontanella Borghese 22, % 06-6878369,
Bus: Minibus 117 or 119 to the Corso at Via Tomacelli; and Via dei Due
Macelli 68, % 06-6795884, Bus: Minibus 116, 117, or 119 to Via Due
Macelli). You’ll find more wonderful paper goods at Daniela Rosati (Via
della Stelletta 27; % 06-68802053) and Campo Marzio Design (Via di
Campo Marzio 41; % 06-68807877).
Rome’s most special source of intoxicants is Ai Monasteri (Corso
Rinascimento 72; % 06-68802783; Bus: Minibus 116), off the east side 
of Piazza Navona. Here, you can find the liqueurs, elixirs, and other 
alcoholic concoctions that Italian monks have been making since the
Middle Ages. Selling herbs and other natural health concoctions, 
the Antica Erboristeria Romana (Via di Torre Argentina 15; % 06-
6879493) has been dispensing since 1700, and the original furnishings
are still in use.
For books in English, head for the English Bookstore (Via di Ripetta 248;
% 06-3203301). You’ll find a number of other foreign bookstores in this
area: German Herder Librerie (Piazza Montecitorio 117); French La
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 199

Procure (Piazza San Luigi dei Francesi 23); Spanish Sorgente (Piazza
Navona 90); Chinese Marco Polo (Via del Seminario 103). Another inter-
esting bookstore is the Libreria Babele (Via dei Banchi Vecchi 116; 
% 06-6876628), Rome’s most central gay and lesbian bookstore.
If you’re interested in antiques, you’ll delight in Via dei Coronari, Rome’s
antiquarian headquarters. This street is lined with antiques dealers, 
one shop after another on both sides of the street — and it’s not short.
Whether furniture, glass, lamps, armoires, jewels, or paintings, you’ll
find it here. If you don’t, just continue along adjoining Via Giulia. Even 
if you aren’t planning on lugging home a count’s antique bureau or a
trestle table from a convent, this area is basically like a museum where
you can (if you have the money) buy the exhibits. For high-quality prints,
well-known shops are the famous Nardecchia (Piazza Navona 25; % 06-
6869318; Bus: Minibus 116) and Antiquarius (Corso Rinascimento 63;
% 06-68802941; Bus: Minibus 116), a nice shop just across the street
from the Palazzo Madama. At these shops, you find higher-quality — and
somewhat more reliable — articles than at the nearby antiquarian book
and print market (see earlier in this chapter).
Some shops in this area specialize in religious art and attire, and
although you probably don’t want to buy a cardinal’s outfit, you may be
interested in some knee-high red socks. Or explore the huge selection of
figurines, bronzes, candleholders, paintings, crèches, and other religious
objects. Two good stores are Ghezzi (Via de Cestari 32; % 06-6869744)
and Salustri (Via de Cestai 11; % 06-6791587).
Finally, you should not leave the area without visiting the Cittá del Sole
(Via della Scrofa 65; % 06-68803805), where young kids play with the
BRIO train table while you can check the high-tech adult toys and beauti-
fully crafted coffee-table entertainment accessories. A great selection,
for yourself and the kids in your life.
Cola di Rienzo
Although this area on the San Pietro side of the Tevere doesn’t boast the
luxury shops of Via dei Condotti and nearby streets, you can still find
big-name Italian fashion and, what’s more, it may even be affordable. Stores
line both sides of Via Ottaviano and Via Cola di Rienzo. Among the many
clothes and shoe stores, with shops catering to every level of price and
style, you’ll find a branch of La Cicogna (Via Cola di Rienzo 268, % 06-
6896557) as well as Iana (Via Cola di Rienzo 211; % 06-68892668). Both
carry cute and affordable children’s clothing. At Kid’s Stock (Via Vittoria
52; % 06-692022289), you’ll find a large array of outfits on the dressy side
for children and teens. A very special store if you are keen on model-
building is Giorni (Via dei Gracchi 31; % 06-3217145), which carries
everything from model planes to lead soldiers. You’ll also find a branch
of our favorite toy store for adults and children, Cittá del Sole (Via
Marcantonio Colonna 5; % 06-3216507).
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
200

Although this is not a traditional area for artistic crafts, a handful of 
very nice workshops turn out high-quality goods, including jewelry at
Carini (Piazza dell’Unitá 9; % 06-3210715) and handmade lace at Ricami
Italia Garipoli (Borgo Vittorio 91; % 06-68802196). Proceeding farther
toward the Vatican, near St. Peter’s Basilica, you’ll find one of the largest
religious-items shops in the city, Savelli, with one location specializing
in mosaics (Via Paolo VI 27; % 06-68307437) and another location right
off the square, with a huge variety of other objects (Piazza Pio XII; % 06-
68806383).
Via Nazionale
Off Piazza della Repubblica near Stazione Termini, running down toward
Piazza Venezia, Via Nazionale used to be an elegant shopping area, but
traffic — the street was a main artery between the train station and the
centro — drove away many customers. Fortunately, Via Nazionale is now
open only to buses and taxis, which has reduced the deafening noise.
The shops are varied, some good and others less so. The revived area
has attracted some big names (perhaps fleeing the ridiculous rents of
the Corso), but it is still frequented more by Italians than by tourists.
Known especially for leather goods, this may be the best place to find
that sleek number you really want without having to go to Florence.
Trastevere
This is where you go for a dip into romantic medieval Rome and an inter-
esting mix of artists’ workshops, craftspeople’s showrooms, and a great
variety of small shops selling anything from mystic art to traditional food.
Some of the shops here have been in business for decades, while others
are new ventures. Via della Scala is the best, lined almost wall-to-wall
with showrooms and workshops. Massimo Langosco di Langosco (Via
della Scala 77; % 06-5896375) and Ferrone (Via della Scala 76; % 06-
5803801) are excellent goldsmiths; Scala Magica (Via della Scala 66; 
% 06-5894098) and Scala 14 (Via della Scala 14; % 06-5883580) are
dressmakers. One interesting shop is Pandora (Piazza Santa Maria in
Trastevere 6; % 06-5895658), which carries a great selection of Murano
glass and Italian designer goods. Modi e Materie (Vicolo del Cinque; 
% 06-5885280) stocks ceramics from the island of Sardinia; Ciliegia (Via
della Scala 5; % 06-5818149) specializes in fashions from Positano, from
handmade sandals and dresses to curios; and Guaytamelli (Via del Moro
59; % 06-5880704) sells sundials and other ancient time-measuring instru-
ments. You’ll find woodcarving at Laboratorio Ilaria Miani (Via degli
Orti di Alibert 13/A; % 06-6861366), stringed instruments at Mohesen
(Vicolo del Cedro 33; % 06-5882484), ceramics at Ceramica Sarti (Via
Santa Dorotea 21; % 06-5882079), and jewelry at Elisabeth Frolet (Via
della Pelliccia 30; % 06-5816614). Officina della Carta (Via Benedetta
26; % 06-5895557) stocks paper and leather goods in the best Italian
tradition. You’ll even find a nice English bookstore, the Corner Bookshop
(Via del Moro 48; % 06-5836942).

n the following five itineraries, we make recommendations on how
best to spend your time in Rome and offer a few possible themes to
give your vacation focus. You may have limited time, young traveling
companions, or special interests that you’d like to satisfy during your
visit. No matter what your time restrictions or desires, we’ve got you
covered in this chapter.
Turn to Chapter 11 for full listings of the attractions described in this
chapter.
Rome in Three Days
So much to see, so little time! Here, we put together an itinerary for
seeing the best Rome has to offer in the shortest possible time without
suffering total exhaustion. This itinerary is a great introduction to a city
for which, in the words of the great Italian writer Silvio Negro, a lifetime
is not enough to know.
Day 1
Start with an overview of the city to get your bearings and get a sense of
the flavor by taking the excellent ATAC bus tour (see Chapter 11). This
tour will leave you hungry for more, but if you start early, you’ll have time
to take in a major sight before lunch. Make it the Colosseum, for which
you’ll have made reservations (see Chapter 11), and then continue with

the adjacent Roman Forum. Have lunch in the area at the Hostaria da
Nerone or at Angelino ai Fori (see Chapter 10).
In the afternoon, cross the Tiber and head for St. Peter’s Basilica. See as
much as you can there, and then, if you have time before dinner, take a
shopping break on the Via Cola di Rienzo (see Chapter 12). You’ll be fam-
ished afterward; luckily, the charming traditional tavern Dante Taberna
de’ Gracchi (see Chapter 10) is not far away. Or head for the picturesque
and inventive La Veranda (see Chapter 10), which will give you the excuse
of strolling through Piazza San Pietro by night, a very romantic sight.
Day 2
Start your day with a visit to the Vatican Museums, for which you’ll have
booked a tour in advance to avoid the lines, and take in the Sistine
Chapel. If your legs are not too tired, walk toward Castel Sant’Angelo,
which you can at least admire from the outside, and stroll across its
magnificent bridge to the other side of the Tiber. Have lunch at Capricci
Siciliani (see Chapter 10).
In the afternoon, relax with a stroll through the heart of Renaissance Rome
and maybe even indulge in some shopping. Visit Piazza Navona and per-
haps pop into the Museum of the City of Rome before stopping for an
espresso at Antico Caffè della Pace (see Chapter 16) or a gelato at Giolitti
(see Chapter 10), then visiting the Pantheon. Crossing Corso Vittorio
Emanuele II, you come to one of the most atmospheric squares in Rome,
the Campo de’ Fiori (see Chapter 11). Eat dinner at Ditirambo (Chapter
10), or cross over to the nearby Ghetto — the old Jewish quarter of the
city — and try something different at Da Giggetto (Chapter 10).
Day 3
Start your third day with a visit to the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme
(make a reservation to see the Roman frescoes), and stroll to the nearby
Diocletian Baths, popping in Santa Maria degli Angeli church. When
you’re finished, take a bus to Via Veneto and have lunch in the area (see
Chapter 10).
After lunch, stroll to nearby Piazza di Spagna to see the famous Spanish
Steps (see Chapter 11). Along the way, check out the shops on Via del
Babuino — a street lined with antiques stores — as well as the other
shops in the area, including Via Margutta, high-fashion Via Frattina, and
Via dei Condotti (see Chapter 12). Then make your way to the Borghese
Gallery (for which you made reservations; see Chapter 11). After your
visit, stroll through Villa Borghese to the Pincio Gardens; it’s a beauti-
ful walk, with a gorgeous panorama of Rome that lights up with gold at
sunset. Have an aperitivo (predinner drink) — at La Casina Valadier (see
Chapter 16); then stroll to Trevi Fountain (see Chapter 11), which is
beautifully lit at night, to toss your coin in the fountain: by now you are
sure to want to return to the Eternal City.
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 205

Rome in Five Days
If you have five days in Rome, you can spend time absorbing the sights
rather than just seeing them and moving on. You also don’t have to
make as many painful choices. Follow “Rome in Three Days” for Day 1,
Day 2, and Day 3.
Day 4
Start your day with a visit to Santa Maria Maggiore, a beautiful church
that deserves much attention. You can continue with a visit to Santa
Prassede and San Pietro in Vincoli nearby, and then have lunch at
Angelino ai Fori or at Hostaria da Nerone, both off Via Cavour. Or pick
one of the sights that you didn’t get to see over the previous three days
but are particularly interested in (see Chapter 11), and have lunch in the
vicinity (see Chapter 10).
In the afternoon, head for Trastevere for the rest of the day. There you
find not only excellent restaurants and nightlife (see Chapters 10 and 16,
respectively), but also great shopping (see Chapter 12) and a number of
attractions. If you have to choose just one, we recommend Santa Maria
in Trastevere, one of the most charming churches in Rome.
Day 5
Dedicate your day to discovering ancient Rome. Sign up for the Archeobus
(see Chapter 11) and start your day with a visit to the Caracalla Baths.
Then head for the Appia Antica Park (see Chapter 11) and have lunch at
Ar Montarozzo or the Hostaria L’Archeologia (see Chapter 10), or a
lighter snack at the Bar Caffe dell’Appia Antica (see Chapter 11), where
you can also rent bikes. It is impossible to do everything the park has to
offer in one day, but take your pick of visiting catacombs (such as the
Catacombs of Saint Callixtus), the Maxentius Circus and Imperial Villas,
the Mausoleum of Cecilia Metella, or the Villa of the Quintili. Or just take
in the pretty views of the countryside and the ruins.
For something even more out of the ordinary, book a cruise down the Tiber
to Ostia Antica (see Chapter 14). Have lunch in the medieval village or the
cafeteria inside the archeological area. In the afternoon, return to Rome,
and maybe pick one of the attractions you’re interested in but didn’t have
time to visit. Make sure you leave time for some last-minute shopping. For
dinner, head to the Testaccio, the most Roman of Roman neighborhoods,
and have your goodbye meal at Checchino dal 1887 (see Chapter 10). If
you feel like burning the midnight oil, you can then stop in at Club Picasso,
one of Testaccio’s hottest clubs (see Chapter 16). Or treat yourself to the
best and most elegant restaurant in Rome and go to La Pergola.
Rome for Architecture Lovers
Rome is architects’ and art historians’ heaven. Shaped by the Renaissance
and baroque eras, which completely changed the face of Byzantine and
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
206

medieval Rome, the center of Rome is basically nothing but historic sites.
Splendid palaces and buildings await you at every corner, while large
and tiny squares — sudden openings in the fabric of narrow streets —
surprise you with their beauty, and parks provide shade and relaxation.
If you love architecture, Rome has more to offer than can be related in a
few lines, and here is how to see the best of it in one day: Just make sure
you wear comfortable shoes!
Start with the Janiculum Hill, for a unique view of Rome’s historic
center. Walk down to the neighborhood of Trastevere, where you’ll find
the Villa Farnesina, a lesser-known architectural marvel. Cross the Tiber
over Ponte Sisto — an elegant Renaissance bridge rebuilt in the 15th cen-
tury with part of the ruined preexisting Roman bridge — to reach nearby
Piazza Farnese, graced by the superb Palazzo Farnese, with its serene
facade and gorgeous courtyard (visible only through a gate at the back).
Nearby, you can visit the Spada Gallery, a little-known Renaissance
palace, especially famous for housing Borromini’s Perspective, a unique
architectural trompe l’oeil (see Chapter 11). Have a bite to eat on Campo
de’ Fiori or on Piazza della Cancelleria (for example, at Grappolo d’Oro
Zampanò; see Chapter 10).
After lunch, cross over to Piazza Navona, perhaps Rome’s most beauti-
ful square, and make your way through the narrow streets to Ponte
Sant’Angelo, for the scenic view of the statue-adorned bridge leading 
to Castel Sant’Angelo. Push on to Piazza del Popolo and Piazza di
Spagna — two of the most scenic spaces in Rome — for a well-deserved
tea or coffee break (see Chapter 10). Next, go for a visit to the Monument
to King Vittorio Emanuele II, an impressive if not unanimously liked
building where you can climb for an unusual view over Rome. End your
evening with Michelangelo’s masterpiece Piazza del Campidoglio,
defined by the three palaces that house the Capitoline Museums (see
Chapter 11) — surely one of the great architectural monuments of Rome.
Rome for Michelangelo’s Fans
A splendid sculptor, an exquisite painter, and a masterly architect,
Michelangelo was extremely active in Rome, where the pope and wealthy
local families employed his many talents.
Start with Michelangelo’s crowning achievement and one of the most
important works in the history of Western culture: the Sistine Chapel.
Make reservations way in advance to avoid the lines. He worked on this
pictorial masterpiece for several years in a row (between 1508 and 1512
for the ceiling, and between 1535 and 1564 for the wall behind the main
altar). Continue to St. Peter’s Basilica to see the beautiful dome he
designed but didn’t see finished — he died almost 30 years before its
faithful completion by architect Giacomo Della Porta. The basilica also
houses the splendid Pietà, the sculptural masterpiece of Mary and
Christ, which Michelangelo carved between 1498 and 1500. After taking
in this awe-inspiring sights, cross the Tiber and head to Campo de’ Fiori
for a bite to eat (see Chapter 10).
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Options 207

After your break, stroll to nearby Piazza Farnese, where you can admire
the facade of Palazzo Farnese, which Michelangelo finished after the death
of the original architect, Sangallo the Younger. You can then proceed to
Piazza del Campidoglio, the square defined by the three beautiful palaces
housing the Capitoline Museums. This piazza is a great architectural
achievement in large part following Michelangelo’s design (the 12-pointed
star pattern set in the pavement of the square signifies the 12 apostles).
From here, it is only a short bus or taxi ride to San Pietro in Vincoli, where
you can admire the artist’s monument to Pope Julius II, decorated with his
famous sculpture of Moses. Then stroll up the hill — or take a quick bus
ride — to Santa Maria Maggiore, where you’ll find a little-known architec-
tural marvel, the Cappella Sforza, designed and begun by Michelangelo
but completed well after his death. You can finish your tour with Santa
Maria degli Angeli, the church Michelangelo created by reorganizing,
with great skill and respect for the original architecture, the well-preserved
ruins of the Terme di Diocleziano, or Diocletian Baths. (See Chapter 11
for all the preceding attractions.)
Rome for Families
Children usually hate the very idea of spending hours in an enclosed
space such as a museum or a church. Don’t worry. As it has for cen-
turies, Rome will surprise you.
Start your day bright and early by going to the Roman Forum. Proceed
to the Palatino — ancient Rome’s most exclusive residential hill —
where you can pick up tickets for the Colosseum without waiting in line
(unless you have already done so in advance, which we recommend).
After these three sites, you should have worked up a hearty appetite;
head for Angelino ai Fori, where parents can have a real meal and chil-
dren can go for pizza, or head to Pizza Forum for a slice on the go (see
Chapter 10).
In the afternoon, tackle Renaissance Rome. Descend to the Tiber, where
you can take a boat ride (see Chapter 11) and view the heart of Rome
from the water. Then head for Villa Borghese (see Chapter 11), where
parents can take turns seeing the art in the Borghese Gallery (for which
you’ll have made reservations), while the kids enjoy the green expanse
of the park, renting bicycles, rowing a boat on the small romantic lake —
complete with ruined temple — visiting the children’s museum, or going
on the rides. Descend through the Pincio Gardens to the Spanish Steps,
and walk down to Piazza di Spagna. Have a good dinner at Sant’Andrea.
After dinner, stroll to the Trevi Fountain for ice cream and to toss a coin
in the fountain, which is most scenic by night.

Going Beyond Rome: 
Five Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Traveling back in time to Ostia Antica
 Visiting the fountains of Tivoli
 Dining with the Romans in the Castelli Romani
 Discovering Etruscan marvels in Tarquinia
 Taking the waters in medieval Viterbo
L
azio, the region surrounding Rome, is rich in beautiful and fascinat-
ing sites that lie only a short drive from the capital. If you have the
time, stay a couple of extra days in Rome and branch out from there for
some enjoyable day trips.
Each of the towns listed in this chapter is small enough to explore on
foot — be prepared to walk a mile or so — and offers taxi service in
addition to the public-transit options mentioned in each section.
Ostia Antica: Rome’s Ancient Seaport
Southwest of Rome, toward the sea, is Ostia Antica, the archaeological
site of ancient Rome’s commercial harbor. This is a destination not to
miss, especially if you’re keen on antiquity. Some say it is better than the
more famous Pompeii and Herculaneum; it is certainly extremely inter-
esting, cheaper, and much less crowded. It is also an excellent outing for
kids, particularly if you get there on a very pleasant boat cruise along
the Tiber (see “Taking a tour,” later in this section). The ruins are particu-
larly attractive early in the morning and at sunset, when many Romans
like to come for an evening passeggiata (stroll). It’s popular also on week-
ends for picnics, but most popular are the shows — music and theater —
held in the Roman Theater (Teatro Romano) in July.
The ancient city of Ostia served as a shipyard, a gathering place for the
fleet, and a distribution center for ancient Rome. Founded in the fourth
century B.C. as a military colony for the defense of the river Tevere, Ostia
flourished for about eight centuries before being progressively abandoned

as a result of the silting up of the river and the spread of malaria in the
region (no longer a concern, fortunately).
Keep in mind that the ruins are incredibly hot in summer. They’re spread
across a flat plain, and shade is hard to come by. If you don’t like heat,
come early and end your visit just before lunch, or wait for the late 
afternoon.
Getting there
Ostia Antica is about 28km (16 miles) from Rome and is easy to reach by
public transportation (buy a day pass; see Chapter 8). The metropolitan
train to Ostia Lido departs from Stazione Ostiense (take Metro Line B to
the Piramide stop, and follow the signs for Ostia Lido to your platform),
with trains departing every half-hour and costing 1€ ($1.30) for the 25-
minute trip. Get off at Ostia Antica stop; the archeological area is .8km 
(1⁄2 mile) away on foot, or five minutes by taxi or by bus (C19 from Cimitero
for one stop to Via Romagnoli/Castello, every 30 minutes). If you want a
taxi and none are waiting outside, you can call a local radio taxi (% 06-
5601646) or one from Ostia train station (% 06-56320466).
By far the most interesting way to get to Ostia Antica is a boat cruise
with the Compagnia di Navigazione Ponte San Angelo (% 06-6789361
for reservations; info@battellidiroma.it). They run from the Marconi
bridge (daily in summer and Fri–Sun in winter at 10 a.m., with arrival at
Ostia Antica at noon), covering the ancient Roman route between the capi-
tal and its seaside harbor. If you wish, you can catch the boat back from
Ostia at 2 p.m. for a scheduled arrival in Rome at 4:30 p.m., or you can
return by subway. Tickets cost 12€ ($16) one-way, 13€ ($17) round-trip.
Taking a tour
We feel that taking a tour is the way to go to understand the ruins, but we
do not recommend taking a tour directly from Rome: They are usually
overpriced and don’t allow for a proper leisurely visit. Rather, sign up
for the tour offered by the Archaeological Office of Ostia, led by licensed
guides and art historians. You can book a tour by calling or faxing the
office at % 06-56352830 Tuesday through Sunday. You’ll meet your tour
guide at the entrance to the excavations.
If you prefer a commercial excursion, including transportation by bus
from Rome and entrance to the sights, Stop n Go/C.S.R. (Via Ezio 12; 
% 06-3217054; csr@gisec.it) offers one of the best. It organizes half-
day tours of Ostia Antica, leaving Tuesday through Sunday at 9:30 a.m.
from the Stop n Go Terminal on Via Giolitti in Rome (on the side of
Termini train station) for 12€ ($16).
Seeing the sights
Near the archeological area, you’ll find the Medieval Borgo of Ostia
Antica, a romantic hamlet with a curious out-of-place feeling, as if some-
thing is missing. What’s missing is the river: Pope Gregorius IV built the
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
210

fortified village on the Tiber’s banks between A.D. 827 and 844 as an out-
post and duty station, and it takes its shape from the river bend. The
outpost gained importance in following centuries, and Pope Julius II
ordered the construction of the castle and had it built in 1483. In 1575,
though, a flood dramatically changed the course of the river, moving it
almost 1.6 km (1 mile) to the north. The outpost and castle were aban-
doned and left virtually untouched until our day. One of the first examples
of modern western military architecture in the world, it is quite inter-
esting to visit. The small church of the Borgo is actually a cathedral —
Sant’Aurea — whose bishop, traditionally, is the dean of the College of

Archaeological Area of Ostia Antica
Ostia Antica
The archaeological site covers the impressive excavations of the ancient
town of Ostia. The main streets of the town have been unearthed, as have
some of the principal monuments. After entering the site, on the right
you’ll find Via delle Corporazioni, leading to the Roman Theater (Teatro
Romano). Be sure to take note of the mosaics indicating the nature of the
businesses that once were housed along this street. The theater is still in
use today for performances of works by modern and ancient authors
during July as part of the Estate Romana festival (www.estateromana.
comune.roma.it or % 06-68809505; Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.).
Returning to the main street and continuing, you’ll find on your left the
Forum and behind it the thermal baths (terme). Two temples are on 
the left, and the Capitolinum is on the right. The site also includes many
interesting houses and buildings. The tourist office in Rome has a rela-
tively good map of the park. Allow a minimum of three hours for the visit,
more if you visit the museum. The Ostiense Museum (Museo Ostiense) —
conserving all the material found during the excavations of the site —
exhibits its huge collection in a modern and rational way, making it a pleas-
ure to visit. The entrance to the museum is within the excavations.
We recommend taking an official guided tour (prices on request); you’ll
learn a lot of interesting details. The site is huge and it is easy to feel over-
whelmed. Definitely splurge on the map (2€/$2.60 at the ticket booth) and
on the audio guide (4€/$5.20 at the ticket booth). Facilities are by the
museum and include a bar cafeteria and a gift shop.

Dining locally
The most convenient solution is obviously the restaurant cafeteria in
the Ostiense Museum, inside the archeological area. There you can get a
simple meal (with hot food) at a reasonable price, as well as beverages
and ice cream.

Tivoli and Its Trio of Villas
Tivoli, a small town on a hill 32km (20 miles) northeast of Rome, is our
favorite day trip from Rome in the heat of summer. The resort town
enjoys a cooler climate during the hot months and has been a traditional
getaway from Rome since ancient times. Its three famous villas — one
ancient Roman, one baroque, and one from the romantic period — reveal
Rome’s architectural history as it played out over almost 2,000 years.
Getting there
Trains leave Rome’s Stazione Tiburtina for Tivoli about every hour. The
ticket costs 2.50€ ($3.25) for the 45-minute trip. The Tivoli train station
is outside the town center (which centers on Piazza Giuseppe Garibaldi),
about .8km (1⁄2 mile) away (take Viale Mazzini, and cross the Aniene River
on pedestrian-only Ponte della Pace, or Ponte Gregoriano). You can easily
take a taxi — available just outside the train station, or call % 0774-
317071, 0774-334233, or 0774-314302 — to get to your destination; the
fare to the center of town is about 4€ ($5.25).
COTRAL Busses (% 06-4182135 or 06-4181338; www.cotralspa.it)
leave Ponte Mammolo station in Rome (on Metro Line B) for Tivoli every
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 213

10 or 20 minutes for the 40-minute trip. Tickets cost $6€ ($8). Get off
before the last stop, in Piazzale Nazioni Unite in the historic center. It is
a good idea to avoid the bus at rush hour (after 4 p.m.), when it tends to
be very crowded.
If you are renting a car, Tivoli is a short drive away — only 31km (20
miles) — from the capital, at the end of a very busy consular road, the
Via Tiburtina, running northeast of Rome, east of the Via Nomentana.
Tivoli is a suburb of Rome, and many people commute to and from the
city daily, so traffic at peak hours can be horrible. Paid parking is avail-
able in Piazza Matteotti but can be difficult to find in the high season.
A shuttle service operates Monday through Saturday in the historic dis-
trict (2€/$2.60 per ride; departures every 30 minutes), connecting key
areas in the historic center with Villa Adriana.
Taking a tour
If you sign up with a tour from Rome, you can avoid both the hassle of
driving and the trouble of dealing with transportation in a foreign language.
A reliable agency that organizes excursions to Tivoli is Argiletum Tour
Operator (Via Madonna dei Monti 49, off Via Cavour; % 06-47825706;
www.argiletumtour.com). It runs a four-hour tour Tuesday through
Sunday — in the afternoon in summer and in the morning in winter —
for 49€ ($64); price includes pickup from centrally located hotels and
admission to Villa Adriana, Villa d’Este, and Villa Gregoriana.
Seeing the sights
The tourist office in Tivoli is in the central square of Largo Garibaldi
(% 0774-334522); summer hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. and Sunday 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. (in winter, it closes one hour earlier).
Although visiting the three villas will likely be the focus of your jaunt, be
sure to have a look at the town. The highlights are the second century
B.C. Tempio della Sibilla, on the Roman Acropolis (on the other side of
the Aniene River); the 12th-century churches of San Silvestro (south-
west of the Villa d’Este) and Santa Maria Maggiore; and the 1461 Rocca
Pia, Pope Pius II’s castle, which was turned into a prison after 1870.
Villa Adriana
This is the famous ancient Roman villa located about 5km (31⁄2 miles) out-
side the historic center of town. Hadrian, one of Rome’s “good” emperors,
had this grandiose villa built between A.D. 118 and 138 as his getaway and
retirement home: he spent the last three years of his life here. This villa
was built on the site of an older one dating from Republican times. It
remains magnificent, though it has lost its marbles, so to speak — many
of its sculptures are now in Roman museums. Much of the marble that
once covered the structures is gone because the estate was used as a
“quarry” during the Renaissance, as were many other Roman buildings,
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
214

such as the Colosseum. In his villa, Hadrian wanted to be surrounded by
the architectural marvels he’d seen during his trips across the Empire: On
the 300 acres of this self-contained world for his vast royal entourage, he
constructed replicas of famous buildings of antiquity, such as the Canopus
(the Egyptian round canal ringed with statues) and the Lyceum (the
school of Aristotle), as well as temples and theaters, monumental thermal
baths, fountains and gardens, and a library. Although most of the monu-
ments are in ruins, the effect is still impressive, and the atmosphere
Hadrian cultivated mysteriously survives. For a glimpse of what the villa
looked like in its heyday, see the reconstruction at the entrance. Kids love
both the model and exploring the ruins of the park. Like any ruin in Italy,
the villa gets very hot at midday during summer, so the best times to visit
are early in the morning or late in the afternoon.
Via di Villa Adriana, 5km (31⁄2 miles) from the center of Tivoli. % 0774-530203. Bus: 
4 and 4X from Largo Garibaldi (the main square of Tivoli) to Villa Adriana. Admission:
6.50€ ($8). Open: Daily Nov–Jan 9 a.m.–5 p.m.; Feb 9 a.m.–6 p.m.; Mar and Oct

sion 90 minutes before closing. Closed Jan 1, May 1, and Dec 25.
Villa d’Este
Built in 1550 by Cardinal Ippolito d’Este of Ferrara, son of the notorious
Lucrezia Borgia and Alfonso I d’Este, this would be just another beautiful
16th-century villa if it weren’t for its gardens. Designed by architect Pirro
Ligorio, they are graced by a complex system of fountains — a true mas-
terpiece of hydraulic engineering. Using an underground spring and the
natural slope of the land, Ligorio managed to have naturally feeding foun-
tains, two of which are sonorous (the fountains are a sort of water organ
that makes “music”). The magnificent work is enhanced by the sculptural
work of the fountains: the Fontana dell’Organo (Fountain of the Organ),
by Claude Veanard; the Fontana del’Ovato (Ovato Fountain), by Ligorio;
and the Fontana del Bicchierone (Fountain of the Big Glass), by Bernini
himself. The Fontana della Civetta (Fountain of the Owl) is on at 10 a.m.,
noon, and 2, 4, and 6 p.m. (in summer) only. With all that water and foliage,
the gardens are incredibly refreshing in summer and a perfect spot to be
at midday on your visit to Tivoli. You can pick up an audio guide for 4€
($5.25) at the entrance. Note: It is a good idea to check with the ticket
office that the fountains will be running during the scheduled time for your
visit; they sometimes close for maintenance. If they’re not, we recommend
you reschedule. The villa and gardens are wheelchair accessible by reser-
vation only.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 215

Villa Gregoriana
This is a magic place we love. Villa Gregoriana, the latest of the three
famous villas of Tivoli, was built in the 19th century — but it isn’t a villa
at all. In reality, it’s a beautiful park created to enhance the natural beauty
of the gorges of the Aniene, Rome’s second river, where it makes some
scenic waterfalls and disappears underground for a short while, creating
the grottoes of Neptune and Sirene (Grotte di Nettuno e Sirene). Pope
Gregory XVI had a path carved all the way down to the bottom of the
ravine to allow him to admire the 90m (300-ft.) waterfall, grottoes, and
ponds. The deep slopes are covered with vegetation and mighty trees,
making it an enchanting spot, especially in summer, when it is a wonder-
ful refuge from the heat. The park was closed for a lengthy restoration,
which has brought it back to its original splendor, and is now run by a 
conservation organization. Note: The visit here is a hike in a natural park
over picturesque ravines. It is not at all strenuous as the trail goes down-
hill, but you’ll want to wear cross trainers (or even hiking shoes in 
wet weather) and carry water. Young children need constant supervision
as it may get slippery and falls can be dangerous. If you carry young chil-
dren on a backpack carrier or you are tall, watch your head in galleries
and grottoes.

The Castelli Romani and Their Wines
The hill towns surrounding Rome to the southeast are a favorite destina-
tion for locals — including the pope, who enjoys a magnificent villa in
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 217

Castel Gandolfo — to escape the summer swelter and enjoy excellent
wine and food. Each town is dominated by its own castle (the smallest is
called a rocca) and is surrounded by fertile countryside, the produce of
which is masterfully prepared and served in the many trattorie.
Each of the Castelli towns — Albano Laziale, Ariccia, Castel Gandolfo,
Frascati, Genzano, Grottaferrata, Lanuvio, Lariano, Marino, Monte
Compatri, Monte Porzio Catone, Nemi, Rocca di Papa, Rocca Priora, and
Velletri — makes a pleasant day trip. You may also consider taking an
overview tour of the area.
Getting there
The best way to visit the Castelli Romani is by car. Driving allows you to
visit more than one of these attractive small towns. If you decide to rent
a car (see the appendix for information), take Via Tuscolana out of Rome
and follow it to Frascati. Continue on the local road, which makes a near-
loop connecting Frascati with Marino on one side and Rocca di Papa on
the other. This route will take you through all the other castelli. You can
also reach Marino from the Appia Nuova, taking a 7.2km (41⁄2-mile) detour
to the north. From the Appia, you can take another side road for Castel
Gandolfo. The Appia then continues to Albano, Ariccia, and Genzano.
If you don’t care for driving, a good alternative is taking an organized
tour (see the following section).
If you want to pick one town, the train is a good option. From Rome’s
Stazione Termini, you can catch a train to Albano Laziale that also stops
in Marino and Castel Gandolfo; a train to Frascati; or a train to Velletri
that also stops in Lanuvio. They all make several runs per day and cost
3€ ($3.90). The trip from Rome takes about 30 minutes to Lanuvio,
Marino, or Frascati; 40 minutes to Castel Gandolfo; 50 minutes to Albano
Laziale; and one hour to Velletri. If you prefer not to explore on foot,
each town has its own bus system.
You can also take a COTRAL bus (% 800-431784 toll free within Italy for
schedules; www.cotralspa.it). Buses leave from the Subaugusta and
Anagnina stops on Metro Line A for Albano every 20 minutes or so. Albano
is the hub for service to the other castelli; you can catch COTRAL buses
from Albano to Nemi, Ariccia, Genzano, Marino, Grottaferrata, and Frascati.
Trip lengths vary, but all are under an hour. The price ranges from 3€ to
6€ ($3.90–$7.80).
Taking a tour
Argiletum Tour Operator (Via Madonna dei Monti 49, off Via Cavour; 
% 06-47825706; www.argiletumtour.com) organizes four-hour after-
noon tours in summer on Tuesday and Saturday for 37€ ($48); the price
includes pickup from centrally located hotels.

Seeing the sights
The central tourist office for the Castelli Romani is in Albano (Viale
Risorgimento 1; % 06-9324081). Another large office is in Frascati (Piazza
Marconi 1; % 06-9420331). Both are open Monday through Friday 8 a.m.
to 2 p.m. and 3:30 to 6:30 p.m., and Saturday 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Some of the
villages and small towns of the castelli have little more than a charming
central square and a few good places to eat. In the rest of this section,
we describe the most interesting towns.
Albano Laziale
Though it’s the most built up of the castelli, Albano maintains its unique
charm. It’s the center of the area producing the table wine Colli Albani, a
pleasant white you often find in trattorie around Rome. Albano was the
site of an ancient Roman town built along the Appian Way — the Regina
Viarum (queen of all roads) — around Emperor Domitian’s villa. Later,
Emperor Septimius Severus housed Roman legions here. The little town
remained a village throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, when
wealthy Romans again started building elegant villas with beautiful views
over the volcanic lake called Lago di Albano. During the 19th century, it
became a regular stop on the Grand Tour, the extended cultural pilgrimage
through Europe that well-to-do young men and women traditionally took.
Roman ruins abound — the Sepolcro degli Orazi e dei Curiazi (Roman
tomb), the Villa di Pompeo inside the Villa Comunale, and the Nimpheus
of the Villa di Domitziano — but the great attraction is the volcanic lake
formed by two craters, where you can enjoy a variety of watersports.
Ariccia
One of the most ancient towns in Latium, Ariccia was the seat of a sanc-
tuary dedicated to Diana, the hunting goddess, and was already active
before Rome became a republic. Ariccia originally lay along the Appian
Way, but it was moved to its current location at the top of the rocky cliff
during the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, ugly modern buildings have been
built around the historic center, but splendid treasures await those who
push through.
Ariccia became a key stop on the Grand Tour of Italy in the 18th century,
especially for artists drawn to its beauty. Particularly striking is Locanda
Martorelli, in Piazza di Corte, which is decorated with a cycle of paint-
ings by the Polish painter Taddeo Kuntze. Also on the square is Ariccia’s
most famous attraction, the 17th-century Palazzo Chigi. This grandiose
villa belonged to the Chigi family until 1988, when it passed to the town,
which started lengthy restorations. Surrounded by a splendid garden, 
it was transformed into a baroque marvel by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and
now houses the Museum of the Baroque, which can be visited daily
from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Piazza di Corte 14; % 06-9330053; www.palazzo
chigiariccia.it; admission: 4€/$5.20). Across from the palazzo is the
church of the Assunta, the last achievement of the great master. Bernini
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 219

designed and built it with his pupil Carlo Fontana, who was also destined
for glory as an architect. Inspired by the Pantheon in Rome, the round
church was completed in 1664. The great viaduct over the valley to the
historic center was built in 1854, destroyed by the Germans during their
retreat in 1944, and rebuilt in 1948.
Another important reason to visit Ariccia is the fraschette (small tav-
erns), often with outdoor dining areas, where you can sample local wine
and the town’s specialty: porchetta. Not to be missed, porchetta is a
whole (deboned) pig carefully roasted with herbs, then sliced and
served with peasant bread. A porchetta sandwich is one of the best “fast
foods” you’ll ever have.
Castel Gandolfo
On the slopes of the beautiful Lago di Albano, Castel Gandolfo has a great
beach — bring your suit if you want to swim; your kids will love it — and
a very pleasant promenade along the lake. The town grew around the
12th-century castle built by the Roman family of the Gandolfi. Since the
17th century, it has been the official summer residence of the pope. The
pope’s palace and villa (originally Villa Barberini, surrounded by an enor-
mous garden and built atop the villa of the Roman Emperor Domitian),
are still part of Vatican territory. The villa also houses the Vatican
Observatory, the oldest astronomical research institution in the world.
You can’t visit the papal villa, but you can enjoy the rest of the town,
including Bernini’s San Tommaso di Villanova church and his fountain
on the main square, Piazza della Libertà. Just out of town is the Villa
Torlonia, in neoclassical style and decorated with sculptures by B.
Thorvaldsen.
Frascati
Frascati may be the most familiar of the castelli towns because of the
famous white wine produced in the surrounding countryside. Romans
come here to visit the various cantine (cellars), where you can sample
the wine and eat simple fare, such as porchetta and pecorino (sheep’s-
milk cheese), or a sandwich made with local bread and salame. The
town is dominated by the imposing 16th-century Villa Aldobrandini, set
atop a steep slope overlooking the main square. You can visit its gardens
daily from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. by getting a free ticket from the tourist office,
Piazza Marconi 1 (see “Seeing the sights,” earlier in this section).
Genzano
Picturesquely situated above the Lago di Nemi, another crater of an
extinct volcano, Genzano is a charming small town surrounded by beau-
tiful countryside. Its famous wine is not the only attraction; among the
highlights are the 17th-century Palazzo Sforza-Cesarini and the nearby
cathedral. Genzano’s main event is the Infiorata (literally, “flowering”) —
held one Sunday in spring when the main street is covered with a carpet
of flowers. The wine is good here, and you’ll find a few nice trattorie.
Part IV: Exploring Rome

Marino
The closest of the castelli to Rome (only 24km/15 miles), Marino is a
pleasant small town, though the surroundings are modern and bland.
The town is most famous for its red wine, particularly enjoyable when
it’s fresh. On the occasion of the harvest celebration in October, the two
main baroque fountains in town pour wine instead of water, to the great
delight of all. The rest of the time, you can sample it in the various
osterie and cantine in town — just look for the sign VINO!
Nemi
Nemi is a jewel of a small town. It has its own lake, the Lago di Nemi, on
the slopes of which are cultivated some of the best strawberries in the
world, and certainly the best in Italy. Kids will love the opportunity to 
go for a swim or a boat ride. Nemi also specializes in the production of
salame, sausage, pancetta (Italian bacon), and other mouthwatering
items. Alas, you can’t bring meat products back into the States, but
that’s just one more reason to sample them here. They keep quite well,
and you can include them in a picnic during your trip.
Rocca di Papa
The town of Rocca di Papa, named after its castle, dominates the Lago di
Albano and enjoys breathtaking views of the surrounding hills. It’s worth
climbing the hill above the town to see the great vista; it’s now a park,
and all that’s left here is the ruin of an old albergo (hotel) where people
once came to eat and enjoy the pure air. The town below is quite pictur-
esque. The Chiesa dell’Assunta is a baroque church that was recon-
structed after an 1806 earthquake. Children will love the climb and the
ruins, as well as the chance to swim in the lake.
Velletri
This town was an important agricultural center in 63 B.C., when Emperor
Augustus was born here, and it remains so today. The historical center
of town is very pretty, with many baroque attractions, including the ele-
gant Piazza Cairoli. But the biggest attraction in town is in the cloister of
Velletri’s Cathedral, which houses the Diocesan Museum (Corso della
Repubblica 347; % 06-9627217; www.museovelletri.com; admission:
2€/$2.60; daily 10 a.m.–1 p.m. and 3–7 p.m.), a valuable collection that
includes precious objects and paintings by Gentile da Fabriano,
Antoniazzo Romano, and others.
Dining locally
The castelli contain a procession of trattorie and ristoranti. They’re all
quite reliable, but keep in mind the rule of “trust the locals”: If it’s din-
nertime and nobody is eating in a place, there must be a reason. We give
you some safe bets in this section, but just follow your nose to find some
other great places on your own.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 221

The food in the castelli is typically Roman, including fresh pasta and
grilled meats. People come to sample the variety of local salame and
cheeses, usually served as antipasto. Porchetta, a specialty of Ariccia (see
“Ariccia,” earlier in this chapter), is prepared to some extent everywhere
in the castelli. The wine of the castelli is probably the best in Lazio; par-
ticularly famous are Frascati and Marino (white and red, respectively).

Tarquinia
The mother town of the Etruscan civilization, Tarquinia is famous for its
Etruscan archaeological remains, including well-preserved frescoes. It
also holds a pretty medieval town with a pleasant seaside resort nearby,
Tarquinia Lido. You can easily visit these attractions in one day, but you
won’t get bored if you spend the night, especially during the good
season, when you can also go to the beach.
Getting there
About 90km (56 miles) north of Rome, Tarquinia is only about 10km 
(6 miles) north of the town and bustling port of Civitavecchia, near 
the coast. You can easily reach it by one of the trains, which depart
every hour, on the hour, from Termini station to Tarquinia; the trip takes
one hour and 24 minutes, and costs about 6€ ($8). To order a taxi, call
% 0766-8560493 or 0766-840835.
You can also reach Tarquinia by car from Rome in about 50 minutes on
the Via Aurelia, although we do not recommend it: The road is narrow
and winding, and people drive like maniacs. (It’s a route to Tuscany and
points north.)
Taking a tour
The tour operator Dock&Discover (% 0766-581574; www.dockdiscover.
com) offers guided tours to Tarquinia, starting from Civitavecchia. For a
personalized visit of Tarquinia, book a tour with one of the licensed local
guides in the town; contact the Tarquinia tourist office for a complete
list (IAT; Piazza Cavour 23; % 0766-849282; www.tarquinia.net).
Seeing the sights
Tarquinia was the most important town of the Etruscan kingdom and 
an important commercial and artistic center that dominated central 
Italy until the third century B.C., when it was taken over by the Romans.
Tarquinia consists of two towns: the original Etruscan settlement and
modern-day Tarquinia, which was rebuilt on the neighboring hill to the
west of the ancient town in medieval times, leaving the Etruscan archae-
ological site to await future exploration. The remains of the ancient town
are few but monumental, and the necropolis gave an incalculable wealth
of material for the understanding of the Etruscan civilization. In the “new”
Chapter 14: Going Beyond Rome: Five Day Trips 225

town, the Castle of Matilde di Canossa is still in good repair, and the
Duomo has some nice frescoes from 1508. Lining the main street in the
historical center of town, you find artists’ and craftsmen’s showrooms,
particularly fine local goldsmiths and potters who produce jewels and
ceramics with an Etruscan flavor and design (excellent gifts or sou-
venirs). Five kilometers (3 miles) out of town to the west is the beautiful
Lungomare of Tarquinia Lido, Tarquinia’s seaside resort, with pleasant
restaurants overlooking the sea, neat little shops, and a good beach.
Archaeological Area of the Civita
First settled around the ninth century B.C., the city was greatly enlarged
by the Etruscans, who built the acropolis in the seventh century B.C. The
Archaeological Area is partially surrounded by the original powerful city
walls from the fifth century B.C., of which you can still see several miles,
including one of the main gates. The acropolis is graced by an important
temple from the fourth century B.C.: the Ara della Regina (Altar of the
Queen), the largest Etruscan temple in Italy. It measures 77m × 35m (253
× 115 ft.) and was built over a temple. The base was decorated with terra-
cotta figures, including the famous winged horses that are now preserved
in the Tarquinia National Museum.
Pian della Civita, Montarozzi, 7km (3.5 miles) east of Tarquinia on the road to Monte
Romano. Free admission. Open: Daily sunrise–sunset.
Tarquinia National Museum (Museo Nazionale Tarquiniense)
One of the most important Etruscan museums in Italy, the National
Museum houses not only the extremely rich collection from the thousands
of tombs of the nearby necropolis, but also artifacts and remains from
more archaic nearby sites, including some Villanovian burial sites that pre-
date the Etruscan period. The museum occupies the elegant Renaissance
Palazzo Vitelleschi from the 15th century, which would be worthy of a visit
even if it didn’t contain Etruscan treasures. Among the huge collection of
unique Etruscan objects — artwork, religious and everyday objects,
bronze artifacts, sculptures — the jewels and the ceramics are truly out-
standing. However, the stars of the show are the four tombs from the
nearby necropolis, which have been completely reconstructed with the
original frescoes. The freshness of the paintings is extraordinary; you’ll
find the Tomb of the Olympic Games, the Tomb of the Ship, the Tomb of
the Triclynium, and the Tomb of the Racing Chariots, all from between the
fifth and fourth centuries B.C.

Etruscan Necropolis
The necropolis, with its thousands of tombs, is located at the doors of the
Etruscan town, the Archaeological Area of the Civita. The tombs, some of
which are in outstanding condition and considered quintessential examples
of Etruscan tombs, date from between the sixth and first centuries B.C.
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
226

Fascinating frescoes, alive with color, decorate the tombs, which are
named for the subjects of the paintings; the most famous are the tombs of
the Panther, the Bulls, Hunting and Fishing, the Lioness, the Jugglers, and
the Ogre. The beautiful portrait of Velia Velcha, an Etruscan woman, is
justly considered a great work of Etruscan art.

Viterbo
Off the beaten track, yet following in the footsteps of many, from ancient
Romans to popes and cardinals, we love taking the day off for a swim at
the thermal swimming pool of the Terme dei Papi, by the town of Viterbo.
When we have more time, we like to stroll the streets of the old town as
well. Beautifully preserved, the medieval center is a pleasure to the eyes.
You will be enchanted with the arched doorways and the many carved
details, as well as with the many shopping opportunities. Both attrac-
tions are a short trip from Rome.
Part IV: Exploring Rome 
228

Getting there
Located 80km (50 miles) north of Rome, Viterbo is well connected to the
capital.
If you are going to the thermal baths, the easiest way is to take the dedi-
cated shuttle service from Rome. The spa’s bus leaves daily from Piazza
Mancini at 8:30 a.m.; for the return, it leaves Terme dei Papi at 1:15 p.m.
The public bus leaves daily from the bus station of Via Lepanto (by the
Lepanto Metro stop) in Rome at 8:40 a.m. and leaves the Terme dei Papi
at 4:20 p.m.
Alternatively, you can ride the metropolitan trains (many locals com-
mute daily to Rome) using a day pass that costs 9€ ($12). Take the
regional train from Ostiense station (which also stops at Tiburtina sta-
tion), leaving hourly at 40 minutes past the hour for the one hour, 48
minute ride. Or board the commuter train from the Piazzale Flaminio
station (off Piazza del Popolo), leaving every 25 minutes during rush
hour for the two-and-a-half-hour ride.
Once there, take a taxi from the train station or call one (% 0761-340777).
Taking a tour
Contact the tourist office in town (Via Ascenzi 4; % 0761-325992; fax
0761-308480; infotuscia@libero.it) or at the train station of Porta
Romana (% 0761-304795; fax 0761-220957; infoviterbo@apt.
viterbo.it) for personalized tours.
Seeing the sights
Famous for its medieval historic district, Viterbo is well worth a stroll.
Make the San Pellegrino neighborhood the focus of your visit. An urban
area developed along Via San Pellegrino and Via San Gemini in the 12th
century, this is one of the world’s best-preserved examples of medieval
urban architecture. Take the time to stroll along its alleys and charming
squares.
National Etruscan Museum in the Rocca Albornoz
Housed in the Albornoz fortress, this interesting museum focuses on the
reconstruction of Etruscan daily life. It uses material found in the nearby
necropolis, dating from the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. onward. The star
of the show is on the third floor, where you can admire the entire “tomb of the
Etruscan chariot” (tomba della biga etrusca) discovered in Ischia di Castro.

medieval arches, its baroque facade, and its 13th-century Sienese bell
tower with black and white stripes. Adjacent to the cathedral is the 13th-
century Palazzo dei Papi, which was built as the residence of the pope
when the papacy was moved from Rome to Viterbo (a little-known fact)
from 1257 to 1281. An elegant medieval building with a unique loggia from
which cardinals addressed the populace, it can be visited only by request
to the religious administration of the cathedral.

Terme dei Papi
Served by its own shuttle service from Piazza Mancini in Rome, this is a
perfect day trip from the capital. The spa complex of Viterbo has ancient
origins: The waters were used by the Etruscans and well known to the
Romans, who built large thermal baths using the various springs. Most of
the waters are hot springs (about 49°C/120°F on average) loaded with
sulfur and other minerals, very beneficial to people with skin ailments and
arthritis. The hot waters are also a pleasure for everyone, particularly in
winter, when it is possible to bathe outside even on colder days. The big
outdoor pool is particularly impressive, measuring over 2,000 sq. m.
(21,000 sq. ft.). Admission depends on the services requested. For a full
day at the spa, including at least one treatment, such as a massage or a
facial, budget about 60€ ($78).

Applauding the 
Cultural Scene

R
ome offers some splendid opportunities for lovers of the perform-
ing arts. All major performers pass through Rome, and the city has
traditionally been the hot spot for Italian theater. Of course, a moderate
knowledge of Italian is required for theatergoing.
Getting the Inside Scoop
Rome’s cultural scene is very hot year-round, with top-notch performers
on tour stopping here regularly. The scene positively burgeons in summer,
though, when a mind-boggling range of performances go on throughout
the city in various indoor and outdoor venues during the famous Estate
Romana (Roman Summer) festival, discussed later in this section.
The Parco della Musica (Viale Coubertin 34; % 06-8082058; www.
auditorium.com; Bus: M from Piazza del Popolo) — a daring, mod-
ernistic complex — is the principal venue for music in Rome. Designed
by the famous architect Renzo Piano, this grand, ambitious project is
probably the largest addition to the Roman cultural and architectural
landscape in decades. Located 2km (11⁄4 miles) from Piazza del Popolo
and connected to the center by a special bus line (Bus M, for music), the
entire site takes up 55,000 square meters (13.6 acres). It has three con-
cert halls as well as other structures, including La Cavea, a 3,000-seat
outdoor concert space reminiscent of a classical amphitheater. In addi-
tion to classical, pop, and contemporary music, theater and dance per-
formances take place here. Restaurants, stores, lecture halls, and a host
of other activities and services are on site.

Most other performance venues in Rome are in or near the city center.
The elegant Teatro dell’Opera (Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1, just off Via
Nazionale; % 06-48160255; www.operaroma.it; Metro: Line A to
Repubblica; Bus: Minibus 116 to Via A. Depretis) — a beautiful venue
built at the end of the 19th century — books opera as well as ballet and
classical concerts. The Teatro Olimpico (Piazza Gentile da Fabriano; 
% 06-3265991; www.teatroolimpico.it; Tram: 225 from Piazzale
Flaminio), another great space, schedules musical performances of 
all kinds.
From June through September — during many venues’ off season —
Roman nights come alive with the Estate Romana (Roman Summer) fes-
tival, a series of musical, theatrical, and other cultural events (also see
Chapter 16). These often take place in some of the most picturesque
locations and monuments in Rome, lit up especially for the event, which
transforms the show into a multidimensional treat.
Among the most impressive settings for the festival is the Colosseum,
which reopened its doors to the public in 2000 after 15 centuries (don’t
expect blood sports and severed limbs, however; civilization has changed
somewhat in the interim). Also very dramatic is the Theatre of the
Caracalla Baths (Teatro delle Terme di Caracalla, Viale delle Terme di
Caracalla 52; contact the Teatro dell’Opera at % 06-48160255 for infor-
mation), where the Teatro dell’Opera holds some of its summer season.
To hear Verdi’s Requiem resounding at night through the cavernous, mas-
sive ruins is a truly remarkable musical experience. Other unique venues
for summer events are the Roman Forum (Via dei Fori Imperiali; % 06-
70393427); Villa Borghese (Largo Aqua Felix, entrance at Piazzale delle
Ginestre; % 06-82077304 Mon–Thurs 9 a.m.–4 p.m. and Fri 9 a.m.–1 p.m.);
the elegant Chiostro del Bramante (Via della Pace; % 06-7807695); the
Archeological Park of Teatro Marcello (Via del Teatro Marcello; % 06-
87131590); the mausoleum–cum–fort Castel Sant’Angelo (Lungotevere
Castello 50; % 06-32869 or 06-32861); and, outside Rome, the Teatro
Romano of Ostia Antica (Viale dei Romagnoli 717, Ostia Antica; % 06-
56352850). You can find details on the festival online at www.estate
romana.comune.roma.it (also in English) or get information by calling
% 06-68809505 Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The opera, classic concerts, and ballet always call for elegant dress, as
do the most famous theaters and even the best jazz clubs. More casual
attire is okay for other venues and shows.
The curtain is usually right on time, and if you miss it, you’ll usually
have to wait for the intermission to take your seat. It’s customary to give
a small tip to your usher.
Shows are usually late enough so that you can have a regular dinner;
because most venues are in the center of Rome, you can pick a restau-
rant in the area (see Chapter 10) and still make it to the show on time.
For after-theater restaurants, see the “After-theater dining” sidebar, later
in this chapter.

Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
Rome’s tourist office publishes an excellent monthly review called The
Happening City; you can pick up an English- or Italian-language copy at
any of the tourist info points listed in Appendix A and in Chapter 8, or
you can request that it be e-mailed to you before you leave (www.roma
turismo.it), which is smart if you want to order tickets in advance.
Indeed, if you’re coming for only a short vacation, you’ll do a lot better
by ordering your tickets from home, especially for big performances that
will be sold out or booked well before your feet touch Italian soil.
We recommend using an Italian ticket service for your bookings; they
usually charge less and have access to more shows. A good, comprehen-
sive option is TicketOne (% 02-392261 for an English-speaking operator;
www.ticketone.it). Others we like are Charta (www.charta.it) — an
Italy-wide Internet-based agent for theater, concerts, and dance — and
the user-friendly Viva Ticket (www.vivaticket.it). All have English
versions and allow you to make reservations and purchase tickets online.
Global Edwards & Edwards (% 800-223-6108 in the U.S.; no Web site)
is a good ticket agency that’s based in England. Many U.S.-based agen-
cies offer advance tickets sales for events in Rome, but none of them is
as comprehensive as the Italian services, and they charge steep service
fees. Nonetheless, if you want to use a U.S.-based company, a good one
is Culturalitaly.com (% 800-380-0014; fax: 928-639-0388; www.cultural
italy.com), a Los Angeles–based company that offers tickets for a nice
selection of events.
In Rome, you’ll find detailed listings of events in the weekly publication
Roma C’è, which has a section in English and is available in all news-
stands (it comes out on Wed). You can also find information in the daily
newspapers. Other sources are the fortnightly magazine Wanted in Rome
(www.wantedinrome.com) and the monthly magazine The American
(www.theamericanmag.com), which covers all of Italy; both are in English
and available in online versions. You’ll find them at most newsstands in the
historic center of the city. You can also pick up a copy of The Happening
City or view it online (www.romaturismo.it; click Events in Rome and
then Happening in Rome); it’s an excellent review of events published by
Rome’s tourist board. For information about the Estate Romana festival,
see “Getting the Inside Scoop,” earlier in this chapter. Besides the
resources listed in this section, your hotel concierge will always be able
to help you find out what’s on and purchase tickets.
Many venues offer reduced-price tickets and matinees on one day of 
the week, often Thursday. For last-minute theater tickets at a discount 
of up to 50 percent, visit the booth at Via Bari 20, off Piazza Salerno 
(% 06-44180212; Metro: Line B to Policlinico; Bus: 61, 490, 491, 495;
Tues–Sat 2–8 p.m.).
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 237

Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
On any given day in Rome, you’ll have a large number of shows from
which to choose. Here, we highlight the main categories. During the
summer, remember to check with the tourist office for the special events
of the Estate Romana festival.
Symphony
A variety of classical concerts take place in Rome on a daily basis; you
can check out programs with the tourist office and in the publications
we recommend (see the preceding section) or directly with each of the
following organizations. The most important orchestras and associa-
tions are the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia (Parco della Musica,
Viale Coubertin 34; % 06-8082058; www.santacecilia.it), one of
Italy’s premier musical groups, which puts on classical concerts and
events and holds a summer season during the Estate Romana (see ear-
lier in this chapter); the Opera di Roma (Teatro dell’Opera, Piazza
Beniamino Gigli 1; % 06-48160, or 800-016665 toll free within Italy;
www.operaroma.it); and the Filarmonica di Roma, also called
Accademia Filarmonica Romana (Teatro Olimpico, Piazza Gentile da
Fabriano; % 06-3265991; www.teatroolimpico.it).
Other important groups include the Amici della Musica Sacra (Via Paolo
VI 29; % 06-68301665; www.amicimusicasacra.com), Il Tempietto 
(% 06-87201523; www.tempietto.org), the Orchestra di Roma e 
del Lazio (% 06-9766711; www.orchestradellazio.it), and the
Fondazione Arts Academy Roma (% 06-44252303; www.artsacademy.
it). In addition to regular performance spaces, classical concerts are
held in churches and various halls all over the city. One acclaimed series
is the concerts scheduled in all of Rome’s basilicas for the International
Festival of Sacred Music and Art (% 06-6869187; fax: 06-6873300; www.
festivalmusicaeartesacra.net) in October. A particularly pleasant

After-theater dining
At least a couple of restaurants near each theater in Rome specialize in after-theater
service. Showtime is usually late enough that you can easily have an early dinner any-
where, but if you want to do like the Romans, try to resist until after the show and check
out one of these late-night spots.
Among the restaurants we suggest in Chapter 10, those that stay open late are
Bolognese, Checchino dal 1887, and Gusto. You can also try Il Boscaiolo (Via degli
Artisti; % 06-4884023), a very nice pizzeria behind the Teatro Sistina; L’Archetto (Via
dell’Archetto; % 06-6789064), a good spaghetteria steps from the Teatro Quirino; and
the good Roman fare at Il Cantuccio (Corso Rinascimento 71; % 06-68802982), not far
from the Teatro Valle and the Teatro Argentina.

series is the concerts of the Musici Veneziani in the Anglican church of
San Paolo entro le Mura (Via Nazionale 16, at the corner of Via Napoli;
% 06-4826296), with a repertoire of operatic arias — Verdi, Puccini, Bizet,
and Mozart, among others — and performers in baroque costumes.
Concerts usually start at 8 p.m., and tickets cost 15€ to 30€ ($20–$40).
Check with the tourist office for a complete schedule of events.
Tickets prices vary according to the performance and, in the largest thea-
ters, the quality of the seat. They range from free to 50€ ($65).
Opera
Opera is pretty much limited to the great national theater of the Teatro
dell’Opera (Piazza Beniamino Gigli 1; % 06-48160; www.operaroma.it).
Its season runs from January to June, but it also has a not-to-be-missed
summer season during the famous Estate Romana (see earlier in this
chapter), with performances held at the picturesque Theatre of the
Caracalla Baths (Teatro delle Terme di Caracalla). Ticket prices run
about 30€ to 120€ ($40–$160), depending on the seat and performance.
Dance
Ballet and dance performances are quite numerous in Rome and are
often of world-class quality. The Rome Opera Ballet performs classical
and modern works at the Teatro dell’Opera (see the preceding section);
international performers often stage their shows at the Teatro Olimpico
or the Parco della Musica (see listings earlier in this chapter).
Ticket prices vary according to the performance, the venue, and — in
large theaters — the quality of the seat. They run from 10€ ($13) for a
performance at the Parco della Musica to 120€ ($160) for the best seat
at the Teatro dell’Opera.
Theater
Rome is famous for theater, and some of the best companies in the coun-
try and the world perform here. Italy has produced such playwrights as
Goldoni, Pirandello, and Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo. Of course, if you
don’t understand Italian, you won’t get much out of Roman theater; but
if you do know the language, you’ll be delighted by the number of per-
formances, from classical to contemporary. Fortunately, some shows are
in English, especially in the summer during the Estate Romana festival
(see later in this section).
The best theaters in Rome are the Teatro Argentina (Largo Argentina
52; % 06-684000345; www.teatrodiroma.net), Teatro Brancaccio (Via
Merulana 244, off Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore; % 06-47824893; www.
teatrobrancaccio.net), Teatro Ghione (Via delle Fornaci 37; % 06-
6372294; www.ghione.it), Teatro Quirino (Via delle Vergini 7, near
Fontana di Trevi; % 06-6794585; www.teatroquirino.it), Teatro Valle
(Via del Teatro Valle 21, near Piazza Navona; % 06-68803794; www.teatro
valle.it), and Teatro Sistina (Via Sistina 129, off Via del Tritone; 
Chapter 15: Applauding the Cultural Scene 239

% 06-4200711; www.ilsistina.com). There are a great number of
others, all quite good.
During the summer, many theater performances move outdoors for 
the Estate Romana festival. One of the highest rated for tourists is the
Miracle Players (% 06-70393427; www.miracleplayers.org), an
English company that performs in English at the Roman Forum (Via dei
Fori Imperiali; % 06-70393427). As the name suggests, the Toti Globe
Theatre in Villa Borghese (Largo Aqua Felix, entrance at Piazzale delle
Ginestre; % 06-82077304; www.globetheatreroma.com) is a replica of
the famous Shakespearean theater, where the Toti performs Shakespeare
as well as other productions. The Teatro Romano of Ostia Antica (Viale
dei Romagnoli 717, Ostia Antica; % 06-56358041), a bit farther afield, is
well worth the trip. It always offers a summer season in the highly
atmospheric Roman theater in the archaeological site at the ancient sea-
port of Ostia.
The Centrale RistoTheatre (Via Celsa 6, off Piazza del Gesu; 
% 06-6780501; www.centraleristotheatre.com) is an ultramodern
restaurant–cabaret–theater presenting musical and theatrical perform-
ances that you can enjoy over an aperitivo (predinner drink) and a 
light snack or dinner. The dinner — with a weekly menu based on
Tuscan fare — is at 7:30 p.m., and the live show is at 10:30 p.m.
Ticket prices vary according to the performance and venue, but they
usually range from 12€ to 26€ ($16–$34).

Finding Out What’s on Where
The Happening City magazine is an excellent review of events, published
by Rome’s tourist board and available at www.romaturismo.it (see
Appendix A). You can also find extensive listings in the daily newspapers
and in the weekly publication Roma C’è, available at newsstands (it comes
out on Wed), with some listings in English. Other sources are Wanted in
Rome, a fortnightly magazine (Via dei Delfini 17; % 06-6790190; www.
wantedinrome.com), and The American (www.theamericanmag.com),
a 48-page monthly covering all of Italy, with extensive listings for Rome.
Both are available at newsstands in the historic center and at selected
newsstands elsewhere, and online.
Get details about the Estate Romana festival at tourist points and at
www.estateromana.comune.roma.it (also in English), or by calling 
% 06-68809505 Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
All That Jazz
Romans love jazz, and the city is home to many first-rate venues featur-
ing excellent local musicians as well as all the big international names.
Most clubs are in Trastevere and in Prati; doors open around 10 p.m.
and close around 3 a.m. Cover charges vary depending on the event and
the club, but they usually range between 7€ ($9) for a regular night and
30€ ($39) for special concerts.
The most famous clubs are the Alexanderplatz (Via Ostia 9, just off the
Musei Vaticani; % 06-39742171; www.alexanderplatz.it; Metro: Line

A to Ottaviano/San Pietro; Bus: 23 to Via Leone IV), where reservations
are recommended; Big Mama (Vicolo San Francesco a Ripa 18, Trastevere;
% 06-5812551; www.bigmama.it; Metro: Piramide; Tram: 8), which
attracts both small and big names in jazz and blues and is somewhat
more expensive, depending on how bright the star is; and the Fonclea
(Via Crescenzio 82/a, behind Castel Sant’Angelo; % 06-6896302; www.
fonclea.it; Bus: 23 to Via Crescenzio), where the emphasis is on jazz,
with excellent ethnic and other concerts. Another great place for jazz,
although a bit out of the city center, is the La Palma Club (Via Giuseppe
Mirri 35; % 06-43599029; www.lapalmaclub.it), not far from the
Tiburtina train station; the popular Fandango Jazz Festival takes place
here in June and July.
Other seasonal events include the Rome Jazz Festival (www.romajazz
festival.it) in November, and concerts during the Estate Romana fes-
tival (see earlier in this chapter): Fiesta! (Ippodromo delle Capannelle,
Via Appia Nuova 1245; % 06-7182139), with Latin American jazz; an
incarnation of the Rome Jazz Festival (see above); and Villa Celimontana
Jazz (Via della Navicella; % 06-7182139; www.villacelimontanajazz.
com) performances.
In addition to jazz and contemporary music, you may hear traditional
Italian songs at Arciliuto (Piazza Montevecchio 5; % 06-6879419; Bus:
62 or 64 to Corso Vittorio Emanuele), in the maze of streets behind
Piazza Navona. Unfortunately, it’s closed most of the summer.
Historic Cafes
Rome boasts many famous old cafes that have never lost their glamour.
Although some are protected historical sites, they still operate as regular
bars (Rome-style; see Chapter 10), opening early — usually by 7 a.m. —
and closing around 9 or 9:30 p.m. They are all in the historic center.
Very pleasant, if a little expensive, the Antico Caffè della Pace (Via della
Pace 3–7; % 06-6861216; Bus: Minibus 116 to Piazza Navona) is one of
the most popular cafes in the city. You can linger at outdoor tables that
open onto a romantic little square. Another sought-after spot is the
beautifully furnished Caffè Greco (Via Condotti 84; % 06-6791700;
Metro: Line A to Spagna); among its customers were such famous writ-
ers as Stendhal, Goethe, and Keats. Also noteworthy is the Caffè Rosati
(Piazza del Popolo 4–5; % 06-3225859; Bus: Minibus 117 or 119), which
retains its 1920s Art Nouveau décor.
Not a cafe but a historic restaurant, La Casina Valadier (Piazza Bucarest,
off the Pincio Gardens; % 06-69922090; Bus: 116 to Piazza del Popolo;
closed Mon) was a hot spot in the era of La Dolce Vita. In an early-19th-
century building, with romantic views over Rome from its terraces, it
was closed for decades. You can now enjoy dinner at the expensive
panoramic restaurant or drinks on the lower terrace.

Wine Bars and Pubs
Rome has many a fine enoteca (wine shops). Some are regular wine
shops that turn into wine bars–cum–restaurants after 8 p.m. (and some-
times also at lunch, between 1 and 3 p.m.). Others are wine bars that
open in the evening, usually from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. or later. Popular hang-
outs for young and not-so-young Romans, they’re scattered everywhere,
with some of the most popular in the centro, in particular the Navona/
Pantheon, Colosseo, Trastevere, and Campo de’ Fiori areas.
The granddaddy of Roman wine stores, Trimani (Via Goito 20; % 06-
4469661; www.trimani.com; Bus: 60 or 62; closed Sun and Aug) has
been run by the same family since 1821 and is in the old residential
neighborhood behind the Terme di Diocleziano. In addition to selling
thousands of bottles of wine, Trimani is a happening wine bar. Across
town, the exceedingly popular, old-fashioned wine bar Vineria (Campo
de’ Fiori 15; no phone) still holds its own amid the nightly crowds
swarming the trendy piazza. For something calmer, try the wine bar at
Gusto (see Chapter 10), which has an intimate, romantic atmosphere.
The best in Rome — if price is not an issue — is the historic Enoteca
Capranica (Piazza Capranica 99; % 06-69940992), a winery with a won-
derful cellar. Considered one of the best restaurants in Rome, it serves
delicious creative Italian cuisine. Another famous address is Ferrara
(Piazza Trilussa 41, at Ponte Sisto, Trastevere; % 06-58333920. www.
enotecaferrara.it). It’s popular with wine experts and foodies alike;
the adjacent store sells wine and specialties.
Not an enoteca but an American-style bar with a DJ, the Drunken Ship
(Campo de’ Fiori 20; % 06-68300535) is often jammed. This is the place
where every American student doing his or her year abroad will eventu-
ally turn up — be warned or informed, as the case may be.
The European Economic Union has had a definite impact on nightlife: The
Italian craze for Irish pubs has hit Rome hard. Among the nicest is Mad
Jack (Via Arenula 20, off Largo Argentina; % 06-68808223; Tram: 8), the
place for Guinness and light food; it also features live music on Wednesday
and Thursday. The Abbey Theatre Irish Pub (Via del Governo Vecchio
51–53, near Piazza Navona; % 06-6861341; Bus: 62 or 64 to Corso Vittorio
Emanuele II) is in the oldest part of town and features authentic décor and
souvenirs from the famous theater. The Albert (Via del Traforo 132, off Via
del Tritone, before the tunnel; % 06-4818795; Bus: Minibus 116, 117, or 119
to Largo del Tritone) is not an Irish pub at all but deserves mention: It
offers a real English-pub atmosphere and beer, with everything from the
furnishings to the drinks imported from the old country.
Dance Clubs
Romans, especially the younger set, love dancing, and clubs abound.
You can hear a mixture of live and recorded music at Alpheus (Via del
Chapter 16: Hitting the Clubs and Bars 243

Commercio 36, near Via Ostiense; % 06-5747826; Bus: 23, but best to
take a cab). Several halls offer different kinds of music, from jazz to Latin
to straight-ahead rock, and if you don’t want to dance, you can actually
find comfortable places to sit and have a drink while listening. Alien (Via
Velletri 13–19; % 06-8412212; www.aliendisco.it; Bus: 490 to Piazza
Fiume) continues to work at its reputation as Rome’s clubbiest club —
with mirrors, strobe lights, and a New York–style atmosphere appealing
to a frenetic 20-something crowd. Not to be outdone in the club-as-phenom
category is Gilda (Via Mario de Fiori 97; % 06-6797396; www.gildadisco
club.it; Metro: Line A to Spagna), which caters to an older crowd and
plays classic rock as well as some newer stuff.
In Testaccio, clubs come and go, but the neighborhood remains one of
the preeminent Roman hot spots. Club Picasso (Via Monte Testaccio 63;
% 06-5742975; Metro: B to Piramide) plays blasting music — from rock
to blues — most of the night.
During the summer, the Estate Romana festival (see earlier in this chap-
ter) provides additional dancing venues, including a barge on the Tiber
and the terraces and gardens of monuments around town.
Cover charges hover between 10€ and 20€ ($13–$26) for the most ele-
gant and hippest venues. They usually open around 10:30 p.m. and close
around 4 a.m.
Gay and Lesbian Bars
Rome’s lively gay scene becomes positively sizzling in summer with Gay
Village (% 340-5423008; www.gayvillage.it), a special section of the
Estate Romana festival that includes music and theater performances,
disco dancing, and other entertainment.
Gay clubs are scattered around the city, although lately, the area
between San Giovanni and the Colosseo has been developing into a gay
enclave. Hours are the same as at other clubs in town, from around 10
p.m. to around 4 a.m. Cover charge usually runs about 10€ ($13).
Rome’s hottest gay club is Alibi (Via di Monte Testaccio 40–44; % 06-
5743448; www.alibionline.it; Bus: 23; Tram: 3 to Via Marmorata and
then walk down Via Galbani, though a cab is best). It boasts a rotating
schedule of DJs and a great summer roof garden. The disco Angelo
Azzurro (Via Cardinale Merry del Val 13, Trastevere; % 06-5800472;
Tram: 8 to Viale Trastevere at Piazza Mastai) welcomes all ages and
offers an eclectic mix of music. Admission is free, and Friday night is
ladies only. The Frequency (Viale Odoardo Beccari 10; % 06-7851504)
passes as the trendiest cruising bar.
The leading lesbian club is New Joli Coeur (Via Sirte 5; % 06-86215827;
Bus: 56 or 88 to Piazza Sant’Emerenziana); it’s nonexclusive and welcoming.
Saturday night, the club is for women only; all are welcome at other times.

Think you can make do in Rome knowing only ten Italian
words? Believe it or not, it’s possible, and we get you started
in Chapter 17. In Chapter 18, we list ten of the greatest Roman
artists and point you to where you can ﬁnd their art and
architecture. In Chapter 19, we suggest ten great purchases to
serve as beautiful reminders of your visit to the Eternal City.

Non Capisco: The Top 
Ten Expressions You 
Need to Know
In This Chapter
 Using salutations
 Asking questions
 Memorizing some lifesavers
T
raveling in a country where you don’t know the language can be
intimidating, but trying to speak the language can be amusing at the
very least. Although you can get by in Rome without knowing Italian,
locals often appreciate it if you at least make an effort to speak to them
in their native tongue. And we think you’ll find that Italian is a fun lan-
guage to speak. If you feel more ambitious, please check out Appendix B,
which lists more words and expressions.
Per Favore
Meaning “please,” per favore (pehr fah-vohr-ay) is the most important
Italian expression you can know. With it, you can make useful phrases
such as Un caffè, per favore (“A coffee, please”) and Il conto, per favore
(“The bill, please”). There’s no need for verbs, and it’s perfectly polite!
Grazie
Grazie (graht-tzee-ay) means “thank you”; if you want to go all out, use
grazie mille (mee-lay), meaning “a thousand thanks.” Say it clearly and
loudly enough to be heard. Saying grazie is always right and puts people
in a good mood. Grazie has other uses as well: Italians often use it to say
goodbye or to mark the end of an interaction. It’s particularly useful
when you don’t want to buy something from an insistent street vendor:
Say “Grazie” and walk away.

Permesso
Meaning “excuse me” (to request passage or admittance), permesso
(pehr-mehs-soh) is of fundamental importance on public transportation
and in crowded areas. When you’re on a bus and need to get off, say
loudly and clearly, “Permesso!” People will clear out of your path (or feel
less irritated as you squeeze through). The same thing applies in super-
markets, trains, museums, and so on. Of course, you may be surrounded
by non-Italians, and the effect may be a little lost on them.
Scusi
Scusi (skoo-zee) means “excuse me” — to say you’re sorry after bump-
ing into someone — and is more exactly mi scusi, but the shortened form
is the one more people use. Again, it’s a most useful word in any crowded
situation. You’ll note that Italians push their way through a narrow pas-
sage with a long chain of “Scusi, permesso, mi scusi, grazie, permesso. . . .”
It’s very funny to hear. Scusi has another important use: It’s the proper
beginning to attract somebody’s attention before asking a question. Say
“Scusi?”, and the person will turn toward you in benevolent expectation.
Then it’s up to you.
Buongiorno and Buona Sera
Buongiorno (bwohn-djor-noh), meaning “good day,” and its sibling buona
sera (bwohn-ah say-rah), meaning “good evening,” are of the utmost
importance in Italian interactions. Italians always salute one another
when entering or leaving a public place. Do the same, speaking clearly,
when entering a store or restaurant. Occasionally, these words can also
be used as forms of goodbye.
Arrivederci
Arrivederci (ahr-ree-veh-dehr-chee) is the appropriate way to say good-
bye in a formal occasion — in a shop, in a bar or restaurant, or to
friends. If you can say it properly, people will like it very much: Italians
are aware of the difficulties of their language for foreigners.
You’ll hear the word ciao (chow), the familiar word for goodbye, used
among friends (usually of the same age). Note that using the word ciao
with someone you don’t know is considered quite impolite!
Dov’è
Meaning “where is,” dov’è (doh-vey) is useful for asking for directions.
Because the verb is included, you just need to add the thing you’re 
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
248

looking for: Dov’è il Colosseo? (“Where is the Colosseum?”) or Dov’è la
stazione? (“Where is the train station?”). Of course you need to know the
names of monuments in Italian, but don’t worry! We always give you the
Italian names in this book. It makes things much easier.
Quanto Costa?
Knowing how to say “how much does it cost?” — quanto costa? (kwan-
toh coh-sta) — is useful all around Italy, for buying anything from a train
ticket to a Murano glass chandelier.
Che Cos’è?
Che cos’è? (kay koss-ay) means “what is it?” and will help you identify
something before you buy it. It is particularly useful in restaurants and
grocery stores, but it also may come in handy in museums and other
places. But then the tricky part begins: understanding the answer. If you
don’t understand the answer, you can get the person to repeat it by
saying the next phrase on our list.
Non Capisco
Non capisco (nohn kah-peace-koh) means “I don’t understand.” There’s
no need to explain this one: Keep repeating it, and Italians will try more
and more imaginative ways to explain things to you.

Chapter 18
Ten Great Roman Artists
In This Chapter
 Identifying Rome’s great sculptors, painters, and architects
 Discovering great women artists
 Finding out where to see their work
A
lthough hundreds of books have been written about the great fig-
ures of Italian art, few have focused specifically on Romans. Rome
and the surrounding territory have given the world a number of impor-
tant artists, from the Renaissance to modern times. Most interesting,
some of the first professional women artists of the Renaissance came
from Rome. Their work is all over the city, decorating some of the most
important monuments you’ll see, but their names are often obscure
except to art historians because of the overshadowing reputations of the
male artists who flocked (and flock) to Rome from all over the rest of
Italy and Europe.
We chose ten of the best Roman artists — men and women — who
appear in this chapter in chronological order. We left out many artists
whose names you’ll encounter over and over during your visit, such as
Giuseppe Chiari (1654–1727), Giovanni Odazzi (1663–1731), Michelangelo
Cerruti (1663–1748), and Marco Benefial (1684–1764), as well as interna-
tionally known modern painters such as Giuseppe Capogrossi (1900–72)
and Toti Scaloja (1914–98).
Pietro Cavallini
Considered the Roman Giotto of medieval painting, the marvelous Pietro
Cavallini (c. 1250–1344) was a very active painter and mosaic designer of
great skill. His documented and extant work includes the splendid mosaic
in the apse of Santa Maria in Trastevere (see Chapter 11). Although
many of his frescoes have been lost — as is the case with Giotto — we
know he decorated the inner facade of St. Peter’s Basilica and the main
nave of San Paolo Fuori Le Mura Basilica. At the latter basilica, you can
still admire his mosaic on the facade, as well as the Christ in the main
nave and the crucifix in the Santissimo chapel. Among Cavallini’s other
works in Rome, some of the best are the Giudizio Universale (Last
Judgment) on the inner facade of Santa Cecilia church in Trastevere, 

Chapter 18: Ten Great Roman Artists 251
and the frescoes and decorations in the Savelli chapel in the church of
Santa Maria in Aracoeli, which are unfortunately partially ruined (see
Chapter 11).
Jacopo Torriti
Active at the end of the 13th century, Jacopo Torriti was another mosaic
designer and painter. Although he’s considered less innovative than his
colleague Pietro Cavallini (above), his work was outstanding, as you can
judge for yourself when admiring his mosaics in the apse of Santa Maria
Maggiore basilica and the Enthroned Virgin in the chapel dedicated to
Santa Rosa in Santa Maria in Aracoeli church (see Chapter 11).
Antoniazzo Romano
Antonio di Benedetto Aquilio degli Aquili (c. 1430–1512) rose to fame in
his native city and soon became the leading painter of the 15th-century
Roman school. He developed a highly refined painting technique, espe-
cially for tempera. Indeed, some of his work is exhibited in major inter-
national museums, including his Madonna di Leone IX in the National
Gallery in Dublin, his Madonna at the Detroit Institute of Arts, and his
triptych in the Prado in Madrid. He was very active in Rome, where you
can see his splendid frescoes in the Camera di Santa Caterina in the
church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva; his Nativity in the National Antique
Art Gallery in Palazzo Barberini; his Madonna del Tribunale della Sacra
Rota in the Vatican Picture Gallery inside the Vatican Museums; and his
Madonna in San Paolo Fuori Le Mura basilica (see Chapter 11).
Giulio Pippi
Also known as Giulio Romano (c. 1492–1546) because he was born and
trained in the city, Pippi worked with Raphael in the Vatican. Though
deeply influenced by the greater painter, he quickly developed his own
personal style. He was often called on to finish and complement some of
Raphael’s work, such as the frescoes in the Farnesina Villa in Trastevere
and the Sale di Costantino in the Vatican. He also worked extensively in
the town of Mantova for the Gonzaga family. His work is all over Rome;
in addition to his frescoes in the Vatican and the Farnesina Villa, you 
can see his Virgin with Child and St. John in the Borghese Gallery (see
Chapter 11).
Cavalier d’Arpino
Also known as Giuseppe Cesari (1568–1640), this artist may not be a
Roman native — some think he may have been born in Arpino, near

Frosinone, where he spent some of his childhood. In any case, he was
back in the city at the age of 14, working as a painter’s helper in the
Vatican. He was quickly promoted and started getting his own commis-
sions, gaining increasing fame. He worked mostly in Rome but also in
Naples, where he frescoed the choir in the Carthusian Monastery of
Saint Martin. His elegant Mannerist style modernized with naturalistic
elements made him a favorite painter in 16th-century Rome, and Pope
Clement VIII often called him in. You can see much of his work around
the city, including the frescoes in the Palazzo dei Conservatori of the
Capitoline Museums, the transept of San Giovanni in Laterano basilica,
the lunettes over the main altar and in the cupola of the Paolina chapel
in Santa Maria Maggiore basilica, and the vault of the Olgiati chapel in
the church of Santa Prassede. Some of his best paintings are in museums
in Rome, such as his Annunciazione in the Vatican Picture Gallery inside
the Vatican Museums, his Diana in the Picture Gallery of the Capitoline
Museums, and his frescoes decorating the Borghese Gallery (see
Chapter 11).
Artemisia Gentileschi
Born into a life of art — she was the daughter of Orazio, a painter of the
Caravaggio school — Artemisia Gentileschi (1593–1652) started in the
profession working with her father but soon obtained her own commis-
sions. She worked in Rome, elsewhere in Italy — churches in Naples;
paintings in Rome, Florence, and Venice — and even abroad, including in
England for King Charles I. She is a great figure both in art and in the his-
tory of women. A professional painter at a time when women painters
were rare and confined by rigid convention to doing portraits and still
lifes, she tackled mythological and religious subjects, producing work
that holds its own in comparison with that of other artists of her period.
She has been the subject of many books, most recently Artemisia: A
Novel, by Alexandra La Pierre.
In Rome, you can see her Cecilia and a Madonna and Child at the Spada
Gallery and self-portraits at the National Antique Art Gallery in Palazzo
Barberini (see Chapter 11).
Plautilla Bricci
Less well known than Artemisia Gentileschi (above), Plautilla Bricci
(1616–90) has her place in history: She was the first woman architect 
in Rome and in the Western world. She practiced mostly in Rome, in 
secular and religious architecture. Among her remaining work in the capi-
tal is the chapel dedicated to San Luigi in the church of San Luigi dei
Francesi, near the Pantheon, where she also painted the great San Luigi
IX over the altar.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
252

Pietro Bracci
Considered the greatest sculptor of the 18th century and of the baroque
period, Pietro Bracci (1700–73) produced work of powerful expression
and grace. He became a master in the use of colored marble, which he
used to highlight and provide background for his figures. Among his best
works in Rome are Neptune and the Tritons in the Trevi fountain; the
monumental tomb of Benedict XIII in the church of Santa Maria sopra
Minerva; the statues of angels over the portico of Santa Maria Maggiore
basilica; the tomb of Benedict XIV; and the monument to Maria Clementina
Sobieski (wife of James Francis Stuart, who would have been James III 
of England if the Jacobites had had their way) in St. Peter’s Basilica (see
Chapter 11).
Giuseppe Valadier
A great architect and urbanist, Giuseppe Valadier (1762–1839) made an
important contribution to the reshaping of the Eternal City in the early
19th century. He is considered one of the greatest neoclassical archi-
tects; he also was an archaeologist and was responsible for the restora-
tion of several monuments in Rome. His greatest work is the transfor-
mation of Piazza del Popolo, crowned by the elegant building named
after him, La Casina Valadier (now a restaurant; see Chapter 16). Among
his other works are the Teatro Valle (see Chapter 15), the reorganization
of Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano (see Chapter 11), and the retracing of
Via Flaminia.
Duilio Cambellotti
A multifarious artist, Duilio Cambellotti (1876–1960) is one of the great-
est figures of the modern style of Art Nouveau. He began his career 
as an illustrator and in that field produced much work of great expres-
sional intensity, such as his famous illustrations for the Alinari edition 
of Dante’s La Divina Commedia in 1901, in perfect Liberty (Italian Art
Nouveau) style. He also was a scenographer, a landscape designer, and
an interior decorator and designer, and he tackled most other artistic
media at one time or another — his glass windows are simply beautiful.
We love him most as a sculptor. The majority of his work is in private
collections and buildings, but you can admire his frescoes on the vaults
of the two small halls in Sant’Angelo Castle off the Sala delle Colonne,
and some of his glasswork in the Museum of the Casina delle Civette in
Villa Torlonia (see Chapter 11).

From Antique Prints to
Cardinal Socks: The Best
Roman Souvenirs
In This Chapter
 Enjoying Rome’s finest art galleries and antiques shops
 Shopping for fashion, jewelry, and fine lace
 Finding unique religious souvenirs
R
ome is a great shopping destination for high-quality items, from
fashion to modern art to century-old traditional crafts and
antiques. Whether you plan to spend $10 or $10,000, you’ll have no 
problem finding something that’ll remind you of your trip and bring
beauty to your home or to the home of a relative or friend (see Chapter
12 for store addresses).
Note: Food and wine specialties make excellent souvenirs, but we left
them off this list because of the many Customs exclusions (see the
Customs section in Appendix A) and because gourmet specialty stores
worldwide sell most packaged edible Italian specialties.
Antique Prints
Rome is known among collectors for its many vendors specializing in
antique prints and engravings. Usually representing classic subjects such
as monuments, landscapes, and ruins, they are available as valuable —
and expensive — original antique prints and as less expensive recent
prints from antique engraving plates. Both have their qualities, and you
won’t have any trouble finding a wide selection. If purchased without a
frame, prints can be easily transported and make excellent gifts, not to
mention elegant decorations for your home or office walls.

Chapter 19: The Best Roman Souvenirs 255
Modern Art
Rome is not only a great city in which to view art, but also a great city in
which to buy art. Numerous young artists and well-established pros have
showrooms and studios in Rome, and the numerous galleries welcome
visitors to browse — and purchase. Even if you return empty-handed,
you’ll have a lot of fun just looking.
Fashion
Of course, you can fill your suitcases with designer fashions almost 
anywhere you go in Italy, but Rome has all the great names of Italian 
prêt-à-porter, as well as lesser-known (and less expensive) designers 
producing unique and fashionable clothes. And the great thing about
Rome’s fashion is that it isn’t only for girls; a great number of splendid
shops are completely devoted to men’s needs.
Gold Jewelry
Goldsmiths have an ancient tradition in Rome, and you’ll find many
skilled artisans who have been at their work for decades — some of
them members of age-old goldsmith families. Their work is varied and
unique: Some specialize in traditional designs, others follow the inspira-
tion of antiquity and produce Roman- or Etruscan-style jewels, and
others explore a modern aesthetic. No matter what your taste, you’ll 
certainly find something to your liking.
High-Quality Stationery
Romans have a true love for stationery, and the city boasts a wonderful
selection of sophisticated items, from unique handmade paper to designer
fountain pens to elegant leather desk paraphernalia. Even if you use e-mail
for most of your correspondence, you may find yourself yearning to put
pen to paper when you see thick, cream-colored, handmade stationery or
agendas and scrapbooks lined with handmade marbleized paper (a tech-
nique, by the way, that was invented either in Florence or Venice). Whether
shopping for yourself or someone else, stationery makes a fine souvenir.
Lace and Embroideries
Venice is famous for its lace-making tradition, as Tuscany is for embroi-
dery, and Rome also used to embrace the crafts. Although the tradition
has almost disappeared from the city, a few local artisans keep it alive. 
A number of stores in Rome — well known to connoisseurs — carry a
selection of quality merchandise both from local artisans and from other
Italian regions. Popular items include exquisite handkerchiefs, table-
cloths, bed linens, and children’s clothing.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
256
Traditional Art and Crafts
As the country’s capital, Rome is also the one-stop shopping destination
for Italy’s best crafts and artistic items, produced both locally and in other
regions. The narrow streets of Rome’s historic center have been home to
craftsmen for centuries, and although high rents and other factors have
greatly reduced the number of local artisans, you can still find some who
learned their trades the old-fashioned way: from their fathers. Among the
traditional items are wrought iron, basketry, ceramics, and stained glass. If
you can’t find enough Rome-made specialties to satisfy your needs, a
number of showrooms in town showcase the best arts and crafts Italy has
to offer. All the greatest specialties are represented, from artistic Venetian
glass to brightly colored hand-painted Vietri ceramics to Tuscan marble
inlays. What better place than Rome, the heart and marketplace of the
Italian peninsula for over 2,000 years, to find an Italian souvenir?
Plaster Reproductions
Because so many artworks, artists, and art schools concentrate in
Rome, the traditional art of plaster reproductions has been maintained
over the centuries. You can still find a perfect copy of Michelangelo’s
Pietà or of a Roman bust. Smaller reproductions make great gifts and
souvenirs, and if you decide you can’t live without a copy of the Pietà or
some other large statue, you can always have it shipped to your home.
Vatican Souvenirs
Rome is a holy city and a pilgrimage destination to millions of Christians
around the world. Here you’ll find probably the world’s largest collection
of faith-based souvenirs — from portraits of the pope and his predeces-
sors to signed photographs, religious calendars, scale reproductions of
the Vatican, and commemorative teaspoons. This is also where you’ll
find bookstores carrying the largest collections of Christian books and
literature in both Italian and other languages.
Religious Art and Paraphernalia
Even if you’re not religious, you may be drawn to the many stores spe-
cializing in religious art located near the Vatican and in the city’s historic
center. The best shops carry work by reputable artists and craftspeople,
with prices varying according to the quality, age, and intrinsic value of
the object. The choice is enormous, from beautifully bound Bibles to
religious paintings, carvings, and figurines — some truly exquisite — by
both modern and ancient masters. Also, if you don’t feel too blasphe-
mous, religious attire has a quaint attraction: You can purchase beautiful
red socks (made for cardinals) and superbly embroidered items in a
number of specialty shops.

Baby Sitters
A number of hotels provide babysitting for
guests on request, but they usually don’t
offer structured activities for children.
Rather, they use a professional agency to
provide a babysitter who will come to your
hotel room. Even if your hotel does not pro-

Currency Exchange
We prefer using our ATM card to get cur-

other options. You can find exchange
bureaus (marked CAMBIO/CHANGE/WECHSEL) 
at Fiumicino airport (this location usually
offers the best rates in town) and at
Termini train station. Most banks provide
currency exchange; most hotels also pro-
vide this service, at rates that may not be
worse than those at other private currency
exchange bureaus in town. These are
scattered around Rome, with many near
Piazza Venezia and Piazza di Spagna.
Customs
Regulations are getting stricter. It is best to
carry proof of purchase for your electron-
ics and valuables or register them with
Customs before you leave the United States,
if you don’t want to be charged duty on
your way back. U.S. citizens can bring
back $800 worth of merchandise duty free.
You can mail $200 worth of merchandise
per day to yourself and $100 worth of gifts
to others — alcohol and tobacco excluded.
You can bring 1 liter of alcohol and 200 cig-
arettes or 100 cigars on the plane. The
$800 ceiling doesn’t apply to artwork or
antiques (antiques must be at least 100
years old). You’re charged a flat rate of 
10 percent duty on the next $1,000 worth 
of purchases — for special items, the duty
is higher. Make sure you have your receipts
handy. Agricultural restrictions are severely
enforced: no fresh products, no meat prod-
ucts, and no dried flowers; other foodstuffs
are allowed only if they’re canned or in air-
tight sealed packages. For more informa-
tion, contact the U.S. Customs Service,

Canadian citizens who have been abroad
over seven days are allowed a C$750
exemption and can bring back duty free
200 cigarettes, 2.2 pounds of tobacco, 53
imperial ounces of wine or 40 of liquor, and
50 cigars. In addition, you’re allowed to
mail gifts to Canada from abroad up to the
value of C$60 per gift, as long as they’re
unsolicited and don’t contain alcohol or
tobacco (write on the package “Unsolicited

ables on the Y-38 form before your depar-
ture from Canada, including serial numbers
of valuables that you already own, such as
expensive foreign cameras. You can use
the C$750 exemption only once a year and
only after an absence of seven days. For

New Zealand citizens have a duty-free
allowance of NZ$700. If you’re over 17, you
can bring in 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or
250 grams of tobacco (or a mix of all three
if their combined weight doesn’t exceed
250 grams), plus 4.5 liters of wine and beer
or 1.125 liters of liquor. New Zealand cur-
rency doesn’t carry import or export restric-
tions. Fill out a certificate of export, listing
the valuables you’re taking out of the coun-
try. (That way, you can bring them back
without paying duty.) You can find the
answers to most of your questions in a free
pamphlet available at New Zealand con-
sulates and Customs offices: “New Zealand
Customs Guide for Travelers, Notice 
no. 4.” For more information, contact New
Zealand Customs, The Custom House, 17–21
Whitmore St. Box 2218, Wellington (% 04-
473-6099; www.customs.govt.nz).
Doctors
Contact your embassy or consulate to get
a list of English-speaking doctors or den-
tists. You can also ask the concierge at
your hotel. For any emergency, go to the
emergency room of any nearby hospital
(see “Emergencies,” later in this appendix).
Electricity
Electricity in Rome is 220 volts. To use 
your appliances, you need a transformer.
Remember that plugs are different, too:
The prongs are round, so you need an
adapter. You can buy an adapter kit in
many electronics stores before you leave.
Embassies and Consulates
Rome is the capital of Italy and the seat of
all the embassies and consulates, which
maintain 24-hour referral services for emer-
gencies: United States (Via Veneto 119/a;
% 06-46741), Canada (Via G.B. de Rossi 27;
% 06-445981), Australia (Via Alessandria
215; % 06-852721), New Zealand (Via Zara
28; % 06-4402928), United Kingdom (Via
XX Settembre 80/a; % 06-4825441), Ireland
(Piazza Campitelli 3; % 06-6979121).
Emergencies
For an ambulance, call % 118; for the fire
department, call % 115; for the police,
call % 113 or 112; for a road emergency,
call % 116.
Hospitals
The major hospitals in the historic center
are the Santo Spirito (Lungotevere in
Sassia 1; % 06-68351, or 06-68352241 for
first aid) and the Fatebenefratelli on the
Isola Tiberina (Piazza Fatebenefratelli 2;
% 06-68371, or 06-6837299 for first aid).
Hotlines
For drug intoxication, call % 06-3054343 or
06-490663. The Children Hotline (Telefono
Azzurro) is % 1-96-96 toll-free for children;
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 259

adolescents and adults can call % 199-
15-15-15. The tourist information hotline
(% 06-36004399) provides round-the-clock
information on just about anything in four
languages, including English.
Information
See “Where to Get More Information,”
later in this appendix, and the entry above
for the tourist hotline.
Internet Access and Cybercafes
Most hotels in Rome will let you check
your e-mail, and many have a dedicated
internet point free for guests’ use. In addi-
tion, there are internet cafes everywhere.
One good chain is Internet Train (www.
internettrain.it), with locations at
Via delle Fornaci 22 near San Pietro
(Mon–Sat 6:30 a.m.–8:30 p.m. and Sun 6:30
a.m.–1 p.m.), Piazza Sant’Andrea della
Valle 3, near Piazza Navona (Mon–Fri 10:30
a.m.–11 p.m. and Sat–Sun 10:30 a.m.–8
p.m.), and Via delle Fratte di Trastevere
44/b (daily 10 a.m.–10 p.m.). Another is Yex,
with a perfect location off Corso Vittorio
Emanuele II, steps from Piazza Navona
(Piazza Sant’Andrea della Valle 1; daily 
10 a.m.–10 p.m.). Charges usually run
around 5€ ($6.50) for one hour.
Language
Romans speak Italian, and although many
know a bit of English, most are far from
fluent. Luckily, you can survive in Rome
with very little knowledge of the language
(see Chapter 17 for a few choice terms),
especially because Romans tend to be
very friendly and ready to help foreigners
in difficulty. However, you’ll greatly
enhance your experience if you master a
dozen or so basic expressions. Good
places to start your studies are the glos-
sary in Appendix B and, if you’re really
serious, the excellent Italian For Dummies
(Wiley).
Liquor Laws
Italy has no liquor laws, but drinking and
driving is forbidden, as is displaying
drunken behavior anywhere. Disturbances
of the quiete pubblica (public quiet) are not
tolerated, and you can face stiff fines and
police detention for getting drunk and loud
in bars, streets, and even private homes. A
special wine store is an enoteca; super-
markets and grocery stores (see earlier for
business hours) sell all kinds of alcohol. Be
careful of what you do with your empties:
littering laws are strict, and drinking a can
of beer while sitting on a bit of ancient
Roman wall is considered littering.
Mail
Italian mail has gotten a lot better with 
the introduction of Posta Prioritaria
(express/priority). A letter (up to 20gr/0.7
oz.) to Ireland or the U.K. will cost 0.65€
(85¢); to the United States 0.85€ ($1.11),
and to Australia and New Zealand 1€
($1.30). Postcards will be sent slowly —
the equivalent of U.S. third-class mail —
unless you slip them in an envelope and
send them letter rate. Also, make sure you
put your mail in the right mailbox, or sort-
ing will take longer: The ones for interna-
tional mail are blue (the red ones are for
domestic mail). For packages, you can
choose between the slow regular rate and
the faster but expensive priority rate;
sometimes, especially for valuables, you
may be better off using a private carrier
like UPS or DHL, which guarantee delivery.
Maps
You can find free maps at tourist informa-
tion points (see “Where to Find More
Information,” later in this appendix). If you
want something more detailed, it is a good
idea to buy a map with a stradario (street
directory) at a newsstand or kiosk. One of
the best is the somewhat bulky Tutto Città,
a largish booklet with a full street directory
that costs about 8€ ($10).

Pharmacies
Pharmacies are usually open Monday
through Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and
again from 4 to 7:30 p.m. A few pharmacies
are open all night: Piazza dei Cinquecento
49, at Termini Station (% 06-4880019); Via
Cola di Rienzo 213 (% 06-3244476); Piazza
Risorgimento 44 (% 06-39738166); Via
Arenula 73 (% 06-68803278); Corso
Rinascimento 50 (% 06-68803985); Piazza
Barberini 49 (% 06-4871195); and Viale
Trastevere 229 (% 06-5882273).
Police
To call the police, dial % 113 or 112.
Post Office
The central post office in the historic
center is at Piazza San Silvestro 19, the
major bus hub near Piazza di Spagna.
You’ll also find post offices at Via di Porta
Angelica 23, near San Pietro, and at Viale
Mazzini 101 in the Cola di Rienzo area.
They’re open Monday through Friday from
8:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. and Saturday from
8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. For information, call 
% 800-160000 (toll free within Italy).
Many tourists prefer to use the Vatican
post office (by the entrance to the Vatican
Museums) while they’re visiting St. Peter’s
in Rome; prices are the same as at Italian
post offices, but delivery is sometimes
faster, and you get special Vatican stamps.
Note, though, that you can mail letters with
Vatican stamps only from the blue mail-
boxes in the Vatican.
Restrooms
Public toilets are located at strategic
tourist destinations: outside the Colosseum
(on the side facing Via Labicana); at Piazza
del Popolo (halfway up the steps climbing
toward the Pincio and Villa Borghese); in
Piazza San Pietro (under the colonnade on
both right and left). Make sure you have
some change to tip the attendant. Else-
where, your best bet may be to go to a
nice-looking cafe (though you have to buy
something, like a cup of coffee or a glass
of mineral water, to use the restroom).
Safety
Rome is a very safe city, but petty theft is
common. Pickpockets abound in tourist
areas, on public transportation, and
around crowded open-air markets like the
Porta Portese. Observe common big-city
caution: Keep your valuables in your
hotel’s safe, don’t be distracted, watch
your belongings, don’t count your money 
in public, and avoid displaying valuable
jewelry and electronic equipment. Outside
the central city are some areas where a
wealthy-looking tourist with an expensive
camera may be mugged after dark.
If you’re a woman traveling alone, chances
are you’ll attract young men’s attention. 
If you are particularly striking, they may
vocalize their admiration and occasionally
even approach and try to charm you. How-
ever, it’s unlikely that they will touch you,
let alone harm you, particularly during the
day. Still, it’s a good idea to ignore and avoid
eye contact with anyone who approaches
you. Should you feel harassed, immedi-
ately speak up; don’t hesitate to ask the
help of a passerby or enter in a cafe or
shop and ask for the attendants’ assis-
tance. Rome is a cosmopolitan city, but the
dress code in general is stricter than in the
United States. Although you’ll see a lot of
female skin displayed, you’ll also notice
that the women displaying it always have
company; if you are alone, you may want
to cover up a bit. Also, it is a good idea not
to wander too far from the beaten path at
night if you are alone. The area behind
Termini train station can be dangerous for
lone women, and so can some deserted,
dark, and narrow streets in the historic
center.
Appendix A: Quick Concierge 261

Smoking
In 2005, Italy passed a law outlawing
smoking in most public places. Smoking is
allowed only where there is a separate,
ventilated area for nonsmokers. If you
want to smoke at your table, call before-
hand to make sure the restaurant or cafe
you’ll be visiting offers a smoking area.
Taxes
Refer to Chapter 12 for information about
Italy’s value-added tax, known as IVA.
Taxis
Taxis don’t cruise; they wait for a call at a
station. If you need a taxi, call % 06-88177,
06-6645, 06-4994, 06-5551, or 06-6545 for
radio service. You’ll find taxi stations in
most neighborhoods; here are some of the
most centrally located: Piazza Barberini (at
the foot of Via Veneto); Piazza di Spagna;
Piazza San Silvestro (near Piazza di
Spagna); Piazza Santi Apostoli (not far
from the Trevi fountain); Largo Argentina
(off Corso Vittorio Emanuele II); Via Veneto;
Via Cavour (not far from the Colosseum);
Piazza Mazzini; Piazza Risorgimento (near
St. Peter’s); Piazza Mastai (Trastevere).
Telephone
To call Italy from the United States, dial the
international access code, 011; then Italy’s
country code, 39; then the area code for
the place you’re calling, followed by the
telephone number. Area codes for land
lines in Italy may have different numbers of
digits (06 for Rome, 0774 for Tivoli, and so
on), but they always begin with 0; cellular
lines always have three-digit area codes
beginning with 3. Toll-free numbers have
an 800 or 888 area code (don’t add a 1).
Some pay services use three-digit codes
beginning with 9. Also, some companies’
numbers don’t conform to any of the pre-
ceding standards and are local calls from
anywhere in Italy; one is Trenitalia’s rail-
road info line, % 892021.
To make a call within Italy, always use the
area code — including 0 if any — for both
local and long distance. To use a public
pay phone, buy a carta telefonica (telephone
card), available at any tabacchi (tobac-
conist, marked by a sign with a white T on
a black background), bar, or newsstand.
The cards can be purchased in denomina-
tions from 2€ to 7.50€ ($2.60–$9.75). Tear
off the perforated corner, stick the card in
the phone, and you’re ready to go. A local
call in Italy costs 0.10€ (13¢).
To call abroad from Italy, dial the interna-
tional access code, 00; then the country
code (1 for the U.S. and Canada, 44 for the
U.K., 353 for Ireland, 61 for Australia, 64 for
New Zealand); and then the phone number.
Make sure that you have a high-value
carta telefonica before you start; your 5€
won’t last long when you call San Diego at
noon. Lower rates apply after 11 p.m. and
before 8 a.m. and on Sunday. The best
option for calling home, though, is using
your own calling card linked to your home
phone. Some calling cards offer a toll-free
access number in Italy; others do not, and
you must use a carta telefonica to dial the
access number (you’re usually charged
only for a local call or not at all). Check
with your calling-card provider before
leaving on your trip. You can also make
collect calls. For AT&T, dial % 800-1724444
and then your U.S. phone number, area
code first; for MCI, dial % 800-905825; and
for Sprint, dial % 800-172405 or 800-172406.
To make a collect call to a country other
than the United States, dial % 170. Direc-
tory assistance for calls within Italy is a
free call: Dial % 12. International direc-
tory assistance is a toll call: Dial % 176.
Remember that calling from a hotel is con-
venient but usually very expensive.
Rome For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
262

Time Zone
Italy is six hours ahead of Eastern standard
time in the United States: When it’s 6 a.m.
in New York, it’s noon in Italy. Daylight
saving time is in effect from the last
Sunday in March to the last Sunday in
October.
Tipping
Tipping is customary as a token of appreci-
ation as well as a polite gesture on most
occasions. A 10 percent to 15 percent
service charge is usually included in your
restaurant bill (check the menu when you
order — if the service is included, you’ll
see servizio incluso), but it is customary to
leave an additional 5 percent to 10 percent
if you appreciated the meal; if the service
is not included, leave 15 percent to 25 per-
cent. In bars, leave a 5 percent tip at the
counter and a 10 percent to 15 percent tip
if you sit at a table. Bellhops who carry
your bags will expect about 1€ ($1.30) per
bag, and you may want to leave a small tip
for the hotel housekeeper. Cab drivers will
expect 10 percent to 15 percent of the fare.
Transit Info
The local public transportation authority
(bus, tram, and subway) is ATAC (% 800-
431784 or 06-46952027; www.atac.roma.
it). For railroad information, call Trenitalia
(% 892021; www.trenitalia.it).
Weather Updates
Before you go, you can check a local Web
site such as http://meteo.it or one
of the U.S.–based ones, such as www.
cnn.com. When you’re in Italy, your best
bet is to watch the news on TV (there’s no
weather telephone number).

Where to Get More Information
As in any other metropolis, getting the proper info is essential in Rome.
Here you’ll find the best sources around.
Visitor information
The national tourist board, ENIT (www.enit.it), maintains a Web site
where you can find all kinds of cultural and practical information —
including hotel listings and the mail and Web addresses of local tourist
offices. It also maintains the following liaison offices abroad, where you

Newspapers and magazines
A few periodicals are printed, at least in part, in English.
Rome For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
266

 The Happening City (www.romaturismo.it) is an excellent
monthly magazine that covers cultural events in the Eternal City.
It’s published in Italian and in English by the Roman tourist
board.
 Roma C’è (www.romace.it) is a weekly paper with extensive
listings of all that is going on in Rome, from markets to art
exhibits and concerts. A section of it is in English and lists all
the special events that are of particular interest to tourists and
expatriates living in Rome. It comes out on Wednesday and
costs 1.20€ ($1.60); an online version is also available.
 Wanted in Rome is an English-language magazine published
every two weeks. It’s sold at newsstands in the historic center of
the city and at selected newsstands elsewhere; the Web site is
www.wantedinrome.com.
Other sources of information
For great walking itineraries, check out Memorable Walks in Rome
(Wiley), a very portable Frommer’s title.
The number of Web sites on Italy and Rome is mind-boggling. Here is
a small selection.
 Dolce Vita (www.dolcevita.com) is all about style as it pertains
to fashion, cuisine, design, and travel. Dolce Vita is a good place
to keep up on trends in modern Italian culture.
 In Italy Online (www.initaly.com) provides information on all
sorts of accommodations (country villas, historic residences,

lthough most Romans speak at least some English and will do their
best to understand foreigners, knowing even a smidge of Italian will
help you enormously. You’ll feel freer and more relaxed, and Romans will
appreciate your taking an interest in their language. This appendix con-
tains some basic vocabulary to help you get around; if you are inter-
ested in learning more, we recommend Italian For Dummies, which
