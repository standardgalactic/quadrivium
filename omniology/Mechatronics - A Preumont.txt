Aims and Scope of the Series
The fundamental questions arising in mechanics are: Why?, How?, and How much? 
The aim of this series is to provide lucid accounts written by authoritative researchers
giving vision and insight in answering these questions on the subject of mechanics as it
relates to solids.
The scope of the series covers the entire spectrum of solid mechanics. Thus it includes
the foundation of mechanics; variational formulations; computational mechanics;
statics, kinematics and dynamics of rigid and elastic bodies: vibrations of solids and
structures; dynamical systems and chaos; the theories of elasticity, plasticity and
viscoelasticity; composite materials; rods, beams, shells and membranes; structural
control and stability; soils, rocks and geomechanics; fracture; tribology; experimental
mechanics; biomechanics and machine design.
The median level of presentation is the first year graduate student. Some texts are
monographs defining the current state of the field; others are accessible to final year
undergraduates; but essentially the emphasis is on readability and clarity.
For a list of related mechanics titles, see final pages.

Preface
The objective of my previous book, Vibration Control of Active Struc-
tures, was to cross the bridge between Structural Dynamics and Auto-
matic Control. To insist on important control-structure interaction issues,
the book often relied on “ad-hoc” models and intuition (e.g. a thermal
analogy for piezoelectric loads), and was seriously lacking in accuracy
and depth on transduction and energy conversion mechanisms which are
essential in active structures. The present book project was initiated in
preparation for a new edition, with the intention of redressing the imbal-
ance, by including a more serious treatment of the subject. As the work
developed, it appeared that this topic was broad enough to justify a book
on its own.
This short book attempts to oﬀer a systematic and uniﬁed way of ana-
lyzing electromechanical and piezoelectric systems, following a Hamilton-
Lagrange formulation. The transduction mechanisms and the Hamilton-
Lagrange analysis of classical electromechanical systems have been ad-
dressed in a few excellent textbooks (e.g. Dynamics of Mechanical and
Electromechanical Systems by Crandall et al. in 1968), but to the author’s
knowledge, there has been no similar systematic treatment of piezoelectric
systems.
The ﬁrst three chapters are devoted to the analysis of mechanical sys-
tems, electrical networks and classical electromechanical systems, respec-
tively; Hamilton’s principle is extended to electromechanical systems fol-
lowing two dual formulations. Except for a few examples, this part of the
book closely follows the existing literature. The last three chapters are de-
voted to piezoelectric systems. Chapter 4 analyzes discrete piezoelectric
transducers and their introduction into a structure; the approach parallels
that of the previous chapter with the appropriate energy and coenergy
functions. Chapter 5 analyzes distributed systems, and focuses on piezo-
electric beams and laminates, with particular attention to the way the
piezoelectric layers interact with the supporting structure (piezoelectric
loads, modal ﬁlters, etc...). Chapter 6 examines energy conversion from
the perspective of active and passive damping; a uniﬁed approach is pro-
posed, leading to a meaningful comparison of various active and passive
techniques, and design guidelines for maximizing energy conversion.
This book is intended for mechanical engineers (researchers and grad-
uate students) who wish to get some training in electromechanical and
piezoelectric transducers, and improve their understanding of the sub-
tle interplay between mechanical response and electrical boundary condi-
xi ii

tions, and vice versa. In so doing, we follow the famous advice given by
Prof. Joseph Henry to Alexander Graham Bell, who had consulted him
in connection with his telephone experiments in 1875, and lamented over
his lack of the electrical knowledge needed to overcome his mechanical
diﬃculties. Henry simply replied: “Get it”. The beauty of the Hamilton-
Lagrange formulation is that, once the appropriate energy and coenergy
functions are used, all the electromagnetic forces (electrostatic, Lorentz,
reluctance forces,...) and the multi-physics constitutive equations are au-
tomatically accounted for.

I am indebted to my present and former graduate students and cowork-
ers who, by their enthusiasm and curiosity, raised many of the questions
which have led to this book. Particular thanks are due to Amit Kalyani,
Bruno de Marneﬀe, More Avraam and Arnaud Deraemaeker who helped
me in preparing the manuscript, and produced most of the ﬁgures. The
comments of the Series Editor, Prof. Graham Gladwell, and of my friend
Michel Geradin, have been very useful in improving this text. I am also in-
debted to ESA/ESTEC, EU, FNRS and the IUAP program of the SSTC
for their generous and continuous support of the Active Structures Labo-
ratory of ULB. This book was partly written while I was visiting professor
at Universit´e de Technologie de Compi`egne (Laboratoire Roberval).
Notation
Notation is always a source of problems when writing a book, and the
diﬃculty is further magniﬁed as one attempts to address interdisciplinary
subjects, which blend disconnected ﬁelds with a long history, each with its
own, well established notation. This book is no exception to this rule, since
mechatronics mixes, analytical mechanics, structural mechanics, electrical
networks, electromagnetism, piezoelectricity and automatic control, etc.
The notation has been chosen according to the following rules: (i) We
shall follow the IEEE Standard on Piezoelectricity as much as we can.
(ii) When there is no ambiguity, we will not make explicit distinction
between scalars, vectors and matrices; the meaning will be clear from the
context. In some circumstances, when the distinction is felt necessary, col-
umn vectors will be made explicit by {
} (e.g. {T} will denote the stress
xiv
Preface

vector, while Tij denotes the stress tensor). (iii) The partial derivative
will be denoted either by ∂/∂xi or by the subscript ,i (the index after the
comma indicates the variable with respect to which the partial deriva-
tive is taken); the choice of one notation or the other will be guided by
clarity, compactness and conformity to the classical literature. Similarly,
summation on repeated indexes (Einstein’s summation convention) will
be assumed even when it is not explicitly mentioned.

Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems
1.1 Introduction
This book considers the modelling of electromechanical systems in an
uniﬁed way based on Hamilton’s principle. This chapter starts with a
review of the Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems, the next chap-
ter proceeds with the Lagrangian dynamics of electrical networks and
the remaining chapters address a wide class of electromechanical systems,
including piezoelectric structures.
Lagrangian dynamics has been motivated by the substitution of scalar
quantities (energy and work) for vector quantities (force, momentum,
torque, angular momentum) in classical vector dynamics. Generalized co-
ordinates are substituted for physical coordinates, which allows a formula-
tion independent of the reference frame. Systems are considered globally,
rather than every component independently, with the advantage of elimi-
nating the interaction forces (resulting from constraints) between the var-
ious elementary parts of the system. The choice of generalized coordinates
is not unique.
The derivation of the variational form of the equations of dynamics
from its vector counterpart (Newton’s laws) is done through the principle
of virtual work, extended to dynamics thanks to d’Alembert’s principle,
leading eventually to Hamilton’s principle and the Lagrange equations for
discrete systems.
Hamilton’s principle is an alternative to Newton’s laws and it can be
argued that, as such, it is a fundamental law of physics which cannot
be derived. We believe, however, that its form may not be immediately
comprehensible to the unexperienced reader and that its derivation for
a system of particles will ease its acceptance as an alternative formula-

tion of dynamic equilibrium. Hamilton’s principle is in fact more general
than Newton’s laws, because it can be generalized to distributed systems
(governed by partial diﬀerential equations) and, as we shall see later, to
electromechanical systems. It is also the starting point for the formula-
tion of many numerical methods in dynamics, including the ﬁnite element
method.
1.2 Kinetic state functions
Consider a particle travelling in the direction x with a linear momentum
p. According to Newton’s law, the force acting on the particle equals the
rate of change of the momentum:
f = dp
dt
(1.1)
The increment of work on the particle is
fdx = dp
dt dx = dp
dt v dt = v dp
(1.2)
where v = dx/dt is the velocity of the particle. The kinetic energy function
T(p) is deﬁned as the total work done by f in increasing the momentum
from 0 to p
T(p) =
Z p
0
v dp
(1.3)
According to this deﬁnition, T is a function of the instantaneous momen-
tum p, with derivative equal to the instantaneous velocity
dT
dp = v
(1.4)
Up to now, no explicit relation between p and v has been assumed; the
constitutive equation of Newtonian mechanics is
p = mv
(1.5)
Substituting in Equ.(1.3), one gets
T(p) = p2
2m
(1.6)
A complementary kinetic state function can be deﬁned as the kinetic
coenergy function (Fig.1.1)

which, as (1.3), is independent of the velocity-momentum relation. Note,

(1.8)
The total diﬀerential of the kinetic coenergy reads
dT ∗= p dv + v dp −dT
dp dp = p dv
(1.9)
if (1.4) is used. It follows that
p = dT ∗
dv
(1.10)
Thus, the kinetic coenergy is a function of the instantaneous velocity
v, with derivative equal to the instantaneous momentum. Equation(1.8)
deﬁnes a
Legendre transformation which allows us to change from one
independent variable [p in T(p)] to the other [v in T ∗(v)] without loss
of information on the constitutive behavior. For a Newtonian particle,
combining (1.5) and (1.7), the kinetic coenergy reads

4
1 Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems
T ∗(v) = 1
2mv2
(1.11)
This form is usually known as the kinetic energy in most engineering
mechanics textbooks. Note, however that T(p) and T ∗(v) have diﬀerent
variables, even though they have identical values for a Newtonian particle.
Since T and T ∗are always identical in Newtonian mechanics, it has been a
tradition not to make a distinction between them. This point of view has
been reinforced by the fact that the variational methods in mechanics are
almost exclusively displacement based (based on virtual displacements).
However, in the following chapters, we will extend Hamilton’s principle
to electromechanical systems and the distinction between electrical and
magnetic, energy and coenergy functions will become necessary. This is
why we will use the kinetic coenergy T ∗(v) instead of the classical notation
of the kinetic energy T(v).
To illustrate that T and T ∗may have diﬀerent values, it is interesting to
mention that when going from Newtonian mechanics to special relativity,
the constitutive equation (1.5) must be replaced by
p =
mv
p
1 −v2/c2
(1.12)
where m is the rest mass and c is the speed of light. Equations (1.5) and
(1.12) are almost identical at low speed, but they diverge considerably at
high speeds (Fig.1.1.b), and T ∗and T are no longer identical. 1
1.3 Generalized coordinates, kinematic constraints
A kinematically admissible motion denotes a spatial conﬁguration that
is always compatible with the geometric boundary conditions. The gen-
eralized coordinates are a set of coordinates that allow a full geometric
description of the system with respect to a reference frame. This represen-
tation is not unique; Fig.1.2 shows two sets of generalized coordinates for
the double pendulum in a plane; in the ﬁrst case, the relative angles are
adopted as generalized coordinates, while the absolute angles are taken
in the second case. Note that the generalized coordinates do not always
have a simple physical meaning such as a displacement or an angle; they
may also represent the amplitude of an assumed mode in a distributed
system, as is done extensively in the analysis of ﬂexible structures.
1 unlike the kinetic coenergy T ∗, the potential coenergy V ∗is often used in structural
engineering; however, it will not be used in this text, because our variational approach
will rely exclusively on a displacement formulation.

The number of degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of a system is the minimum
number of coordinates necessary to provide its full geometric descrip-
tion. If the number of generalized coordinates is equal to the number of
d.o.f., they form a minimum set of generalized coordinates. The use of
a minimum set of coordinates is not always possible, nor advisable; if
their number exceeds the number of d.o.f., they are not independent and
they are connected by kinematic constraints. If the constraint equations
between the generalized coordinates qi can be written in the form
f(q1, ....., qn, t) = 0
(1.13)
they are called holonomic. If the time does not appear explicitly in the
constraints, they are called scleronomic.
f(q1, ....., qn) = 0
(1.14)
The algebraic constraints (1.13) or (1.14) can always be used to eliminate
the redundant set of generalized coordinates and reduce the coordinates
to a minimum set. This is no longer possible if the kinematic constraints
are deﬁned by a (non integrable) diﬀerential relation

Fig. 1.3. Vertical disk rolling without slipping on an horizontal plane.
As an example of non-holonomic constraints, consider a vertical disk
rolling without slipping on an horizontal plane (Fig.1.3). The system is
fully characterized by four generalized coordinates, the location (x, y) of
the contact point in the plane, and the orientation of the disk, deﬁned by
(θ, φ). The reader can check that, if the appropriate path is used, the four
generalized variables can be assigned arbitrary values (i.e. the disc can be
moved to all points of the plane with an arbitrary orientation). However,
the time derivatives of the coordinates are not independent, because they
must satisfy the rolling conditions:
v = r ˙φ
˙x = v cos θ
˙y = v sin θ
combining these equations, we get the diﬀerential constraint equations:
dx −r cos θ dφ = 0
dy −r sin θ dφ = 0
which actually restrict the possible paths to go from one conﬁguration to
the other.

1.3 Generalized coordinates, kinematic constraints

1.3.1 Virtual displacements
A virtual displacement, or more generally a virtual change of conﬁgura-
tion, is an inﬁnitesimal change of coordinates occurring at constant time,
and consistent with the kinematic constraints of the system (but otherwise
arbitrary). The notation δ is used for the virtual changes of coordinates;
they follow the same rules as the derivatives, except that time is not in-
volved. It follows that, for a system with generalized coordinates qi related
by holonomic constraints (1.13) or (1.14), the admissible variations must
satisfy
δf =
X
i
∂f
∂qi
δqi = 0
(1.17)
Note that the same form applies, whether t is explicitly involved in the
constraints or not, because the virtual displacements are taken at con-
stant time. For non-holonomic constraints (1.15) or (1.16), the virtual
displacements must satisfy
X
i
aiδqi = 0
(1.18)
Comparing Equ.(1.15) and (1.18), we note that, if the time appears explic-
itly in the constraints, the virtual displacements are not possible displace-
ments. The diﬀerential displacements dqi are along a particular trajectory
as it unfolds with time, while the virtual displacements δqi measure the
separation between two diﬀerent trajectories at a given instant.
Consider a single particle constrained to move on a smooth surface
f(x, y, z) = 0
The virtual displacements must satisfy the constraint equation
∂f
∂xδx + ∂f
∂y δy + ∂f
∂z δz = 0
which is in fact the dot product of the gradient to the surface,
gradf = ∇f = (∂f
∂x, ∂f
∂y , ∂f
∂z )T
and the vector of virtual displacement δx = (δx, δy, δz)T :
gradf.δx = (∇f)T δx = 0

8
1 Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems
Since ∇f is parallel to the normal n to the surface, this simply states
that the virtual displacements belong to the plane tangent to the surface.
Let us now consider the reaction force F which constraints the particle
to move along the surface. If we assume that the system is smooth and
frictionless, the reaction force is also normal to the surface; it follows that
F.δx = F T δx = 0
(1.19)
the virtual work of the constraint forces on any virtual displacements is
zero. We will accept this as a general statement for a reversible system
(without friction); note that it remains true if the surface equation de-
pends explicitly on t, because the virtual displacements are taken at con-
stant time.
1.4 The principle of virtual work
The principle of virtual work is a variational formulation of the static
equilibrium of a mechanical system without friction. Consider a system
of N particles with position vectors xi, i = 1, .., N. Since the static equi-
librium implies that the resultant Ri of the force applied to each particle
i is zero, each dot product Ri.δxi = 0, and
N
X
i=1
Ri.δxi = 0
for all virtual displacements δxi compatible with the kinematic con-
straints. Ri can be decomposed into the contribution of external forces
applied Fi and the constraint (reaction) forces F ′
i
Ri = Fi + F ′i
and the previous equation becomes
X
Fi.δxi +
X
F ′i.δxi = 0
For a reversible system (without friction), Equ.(1.19) states that the vir-
tual work of the constraint forces is zero, so that the second term vanishes,
it follows that
X
Fi.δxi = 0
(1.20)

1.4 The principle of virtual work
9
The virtual work of the external applied forces on the virtual displacements
compatible with the kinematics is zero. The strength of this result comes
from the fact that (i) the reaction forces have been removed from the
equilibrium equation, (ii) the static equilibrium problem is transformed
into kinematics, and (iii) it can be written in generalized coordinates:

Qk.δqk = 0

nate qk.

As an example of application, consider the one d.o.f. motion ampliﬁcation
mechanism of Fig.1.4. Its kinematics is governed by
x = 5a sin θ
y = 2a cos θ
It follows that
δx = 5a cos θ δθ
δy = −2a sin θ δθ
The principle of virtual work reads
f δx + w δy = (f.5a cos θ −w.2a sin θ) δθ = 0
for arbitrary δθ, which implies that the static equilibrium forces f and w
satisfy
f = w2
5 tan θ

1 Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems
1.5 D’Alembert’s principle
D’Alembert’s principle extends the principle of virtual work to dynamics.
It states that a problem of dynamic equilibrium can be transformed into
a problem of static equilibrium by adding the inertia forces - m¨xi to the
externally applied forces Fi and constraints forces F ′i.
Indeed, Newton’s law implies that, for every particle,
Ri = Fi + F ′i −mi¨xi = 0
Following the same development as in the previous section, summing over
all the particles and taking into account that the virtual work of the
constraint forces is zero, one ﬁnds
N
X
i=0
(Fi −mi¨xi).δxi = 0
(1.22)
The sum of the applied external forces and the inertia forces is sometimes
called the eﬀective force. Thus, the virtual work of the eﬀective forces
on the virtual displacements compatible with the constraints is zero. This
principle is most general; unfortunately, it is diﬃcult to apply, because it
still refers to vector quantities expressed in an inertial frame and, unlike
the principle of virtual work, it cannot be translated directly into gener-
alized coordinates. This will be achieved with Hamilton’s principle in the
next section.
If the time does not appear explicitly in the constraints, the virtual
displacements are possible, and Equ.(1.22) is also applicable for the actual
displacements dxi = ˙xidt
X
i
Fi.dxi −

If the external forces can be expressed as the gradient of a potential V
which does not depend explicitly on t, P Fi.dxi = −dV (if V depends
explicitly on t, the total diﬀerential includes a partial derivative with
respect to t). Such a force ﬁeld is called conservative. The second term in
the previous equation is the diﬀerential of the kinetic coenergy:

It follows that

1.6 Hamilton’s principle
11
d(T ∗+ V ) = 0
and
T ∗+ V = Ct
(1.23)
This is the law of conservation of total energy. Note that it is restricted
to systems where (i) the potential energy does not depend explicitly on t
and (ii) the kinematical constraints are independent of time.
1.6 Hamilton’s principle
D’Alembert’s principle is a complete formulation of the dynamic equilib-
rium; however, it uses the position coordinates of the various particles of
the system, which are in general not independent; it cannot be formu-
lated in generalized coordinates. On the contrary, Hamilton’s principle
expresses the dynamic equilibrium in the form of the stationarity of a
deﬁnite integral of a scalar energy function. Thus, Hamilton’s principle be-
comes independent of the coordinate system. Consider again Equ.(1.22);
the ﬁrst contribution
δW =
X
Fi.δxi
represents the virtual work of the applied external forces. The second
contribution to Equ.(1.22) can be transformed using the identity
¨xi.δxi = d
dt( ˙xi.δxi) −˙xi.δ ˙xi = d
dt( ˙xi.δxi) −δ1

The left hand side consists of scalar work and energy functions. The right

integrating over some interval [t1, t2], assuming that the system conﬁgu-
ration is known at t1 and t2, so that
δxi(t1) = δxi(t2) = 0

Taking this into account, one gets
Z t2

(δW + δT ∗)dt =
N
X
i=1
mi[ ˙xi.δxi]t2
t1 = 0
If some of the external forces are conservative,
δW = −δV + δWnc
(1.25)
where V is the potential and δWnc is the virtual work of the nonconser-
vative forces. Thus, Hamilton’s principle is expressed by the variational
indicator (V.I.):
V.I. =
Z t2
t1
[δ(T ∗−V ) + δWnc]dt = 0
(1.26)
or
V.I. =
Z t2
t1
[δL + δWnc]dt = 0
(1.27)
where
L = T ∗−V
(1.28)
is the Lagrangian of the system. The statement of the dynamic equi-
librium goes as follows: The actual path is that which cancels the value
of the variational indicator (1.26) or (1.27) with respect to all arbitrary
variations of the path between two instants t1 and t2, compatible with the
kinematic constraints, and such that δxi(t1) = δxi(t2) = 0.
Again, we stress that δxi does not measure displacements on the true
path, but the separation between the true path and a perturbed one at a
given time (Fig.1.5).
Note that, unlike Equ.(1.23) which requires that the potential V does
not depend explicitly on time, the virtual expression (1.25) allows V to
depend on t, since the virtual variation is taken at constant time (δV =
∇V.δx, while dV = ∇V.dx + ∂V/∂t.dt).
Hamilton’s principle, that we derived here from d’Alembert’s principle
for a system of particles, is the most general statement of dynamic equi-
librium, and it is, in many respects, more general than Newton’s laws,

because it applies to continuous systems and more, as we will see shortly.
Some authors argue that, being a fundamental law of physics, it cannot be
derived, just accepted. Thus we could have proceeded the opposite way:
state Hamilton’s principle, and show that it implies Newton’s laws. It is a
matter of taste, but also of history: 150 years separate Newton’s Principia
(1687) from Hamilton’s principle (1835). From now on, we will consider
Hamilton’s principle as the fundamental law of dynamics. We stress that
when dealing with purely mechanical systems, the distinction between
the kinetic energy T and the kinetic coenergy T ∗is not necessary; it is
motivated here by the subsequent extension to electromechanical systems.

[ml2 ˙θδ ˙θ −mgl sin θδθ]dt = 0
for all virtual variations δθ such that δθ(t1) = δθ(t2) = 0. As always in
variational calculus, δ ˙θ can be eliminated from the variational indicator
by integrating by part over t. Using

(ml2¨θ + mgl sin θ)δθdt = 0
for all virtual variations δθ such that δθ(t1) = δθ(t2) = 0. Since the in-
tegral appearing in the second term must vanish for arbitrary δθ, we
conclude that
ml2¨θ + mgl sin θ = 0
which is the diﬀerential equation for the oscillation of the pendulum.
The Lagrange’s equations give a much quicker way of solving this type
of problem, as we will see shortly; however, before this, we illustrate the
power of Hamilton’s principle by deriving the partial diﬀerential equation
of the lateral vibration of the Euler-Bernoulli beam.

1.6.1 Lateral vibration of a beam
Consider the transverse vibration of the beam of Fig.1.7, subjected to a
transverse distributed load p(x, t). It is assumed that the principal axes
of the cross section are such that the vibration takes place in the plane;
v(x, t) denotes the transverse displacements; the virtual displacements

δv(x, t) satisfy the geometric (kinematic) boundary conditions and are
such that
δv(x, t1) = δv(x, t2) = 0

(the conﬁguration is ﬁxed at the limit times t1 and t2).
The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory neglects the shear deformations and
assumes that the cross section remains orthogonal to the neutral axis;
this is equivalent to assuming that the uniaxial strain distribution S11 is
a linear function of the distance to the neutral axis, S11 = −zv

v

This variational indicator must vanish for all arbitrary variations δv com-

that the dynamic equilibrium is governed by the following partial diﬀer-
ential equation
(EIv′′)′′ + ̺A¨v = p
(1.34)
Besides, cancelling the terms within brackets, we ﬁnd that the following
conditions must be fulﬁlled in x = 0 and x = L,
EIv′′.δv′ = 0
(1.35)
(EIv′′)′.δv = 0
(1.36)
The ﬁrst equation expresses that, at both ends, one must have either
δv′ = 0, which is the case if the rotation is ﬁxed, or EIv′′ = 0, which
means that the bending moment is equal to 0. Similarly, the second one
implies that at both ends, either δv = 0, which is the case if the displace-
ment is ﬁxed, or (EIv′′)′ = 0, which means that the shear force is equal
to 0. δv = 0 and δv′ = 0 are kinematic (geometric) boundary conditions;
EIv′′ = 0 and (EIv′′)′ = 0 are sometimes called natural boundary condi-
tions, because they come naturally from the variational principle. A free
end allows arbitrary δv and δv′; this implies EIv′′ = 0 and (EIv′′)′ = 0.
A clamped end implies that δv = 0 and δv′ = 0. A pinned end implies that
δv = 0, but δv′ is arbitrary; it follows that EIv′′ = 0. Note that the kine-
matic and the natural boundary conditions are energetically conjugate:
displacement-shear force, rotation-bending moment.
The Euler-Bernoulli beam will be reexamined in chapter 5 when we
include a piezoelectric layer. More elaborate beam theories are available,
which account for shear deformations and the rotary inertia of the cross
section; they are based on diﬀerent kinematic assumptions on the dis-
placement ﬁeld, leading to new expressions for the strain energy V and
the kinetic coenergy T ∗; the subsequent application of Hamilton’s princi-
ple follows closely the discussion above.

1.7 Lagrange’s equations

1.7 Lagrange’s equations
Hamilton’s principle relies on scalar work and energy quantities; it does
not refer to a particular coordinate system. The system conﬁguration can
be expressed in generalized coordinates qi. If the generalized coordinates
are independent, the virtual change of conﬁguration can be represented
by independent virtual variations of the generalized coordinates, δqi. This
allows us to transform the variational indicator (1.26) into a set of diﬀer-
ential equations which are Lagrange’s equations.
First, consider the case where the system conﬁguration is described by
a ﬁnite set of n independent generalized coordinates qi. All the material
points of the system follow
xi = xi(q1, ..., qn; t)
(1.37)
We also allow an explicit dependency on time t, which is important for
analyzing gyroscopic systems such as rotating machinery. The velocity of
the material point i is given by

2 , T ∗

0 are respectively homogeneous functions of order
2,1 and 0 in the generalized velocities ˙qi; the coeﬃcients of T ∗
i depend
on the partial derivatives ∂xi/∂qj, which are themselves functions of the
generalized coordinates qi. Note that without explicit dependency on t,
the last term in (1.38) disappears and T ∗= T ∗
2 (homogenous quadratic
function of ˙qi). Being independent of ˙qi, the term T ∗
0 appears as a poten-
tial; it is in general related to centrifugal forces, while the linear term T ∗
1
is responsible for the gyroscopic forces. The general form of the kinetic
coenergy is
T ∗= T ∗(q1, ..., qn, ˙q1, ..., ˙qn; t)
(1.40)
The potential energy V does not depend on the velocity; it can be assumed
to be of the general form

18
1 Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems
V = V (q1, ..., qn; t)
(1.41)
From these two equations, it can be assumed that the most general form
of the Lagrangian is
L = T ∗−V = L(q1, ..., qn, ˙q1, ..., ˙qn; t)

1.7 Lagrange’s equations
19
These are Lagrange’s equations, their number is equal to the number n
of independent coordinates. The generalized forces contain all the non-
conservative forces; they are obtained from the principle of virtual work
(1.43). Once the analytical expression of the Lagrangian in terms of the
generalized coordinates has been found, Equ.(1.46) allows us to write the
diﬀerential equations governing the motion in a straightforward way.
1.7.1 Vibration of a linear, non-gyroscopic, discrete system
The general form of the kinetic coenergy of a linear non-gyroscopic, dis-
crete mechanical system is
T ∗= 1
2 ˙xT M ˙x
(1.47)
where x is a set of generalized coordinates, and M is the mass matrix. M
is symmetric and semi-positive deﬁnite, which translates the fact that any
velocity distribution must lead to a non-negative value of the kinetic co-
energy; M is strictly positive deﬁnite if all the coordinates have an inertia
associated to them, so that it is impossible to ﬁnd a velocity distribution
such that T ∗= 0. Similarly, the general form of the strain energy is
V = 1
2xT Kx
(1.48)
where K is the stiﬀness matrix, also symmetric and semi-positive deﬁnite.
A rigid body mode is a set of generalized coordinates with no strain energy
in the system. K is strictly positive deﬁnite if the system does not have
rigid body modes.
The Lagrangian of the system reads,
L = T ∗−V = 1
2 ˙xT M ˙x −1
2xT Kx
(1.49)
If, in addition, one assumes that the virtual work of the non-conservative
external forces can be written δWnc = fT δx, applying the Lagrange equa-
tions (1.46), one gets the equation of motion
M ¨x + Kx = f
(1.50)
1.7.2 Dissipation function
In the literature, it is customary to deﬁne the dissipation function D such
that the dissipative forces are given by

Qi = −∂D

If this deﬁnition is used, Equ.(1.46) becomes

(1.52)
where Qi includes all the non-conservative forces which are not already
included in the dissipation function. Viscous damping can be represented
by a quadratic dissipation function. If one assumes
D = 1
2 ˙xT C ˙x
(1.53)
in previous section, one gets the equation of motion
M ¨x + C ˙x + Kx = f
(1.54)
where C is the viscous damping matrix, also symmetric and semi-positive
deﬁnite. We now examine a few examples of mechanical systems, to illus-
trate some of the features of the method.

1.7.3 Example 1: Pendulum with a sliding mass
Consider the pendulum of Fig.1.8(a) where a mass m slides without fric-
tion on a massless rod in a constant gravity ﬁeld g; a linear spring of
stiﬀness k connects the mass to the pivot O of the pendulum. This sys-
tem has two d.o.f. and we select q1 (position of the mass along the bar) and

1.7 Lagrange’s equations
21
q2 (angle of the pendulum) as the generalized coordinates. It is assumed
that, when q1 = 0, the spring force vanishes.
The kinetic coenergy is associated with the point mass m; its velocity
can be expressed in two orthogonal directions as in Fig.1.8(b); it follows
that
T ∗= 1
2m( ˙q2
1 + ˙q2
2q2
1)
The potential energy reads
V = −m g q1 cos q2 + 1
2k q2
1
The ﬁrst contribution comes from gravity (the reference altitude has been
taken at the pivot O) and the second one is the strain energy in the spring
(assumed unstretched when q1 = 0). The Lagrange equations are
d
dt(m q2
1 ˙q2) + m g q1 sin q2 = 0
m ¨q1 −m q1 ˙q2
2 −m g cos q2 + kq1 = 0
If one assumes that the mass m is no longer a point mass, but a disk
of moment of inertia I sliding along the massless rod [Fig.1.8(c)], it con-
tributes an extra term to the kinetic coenergy, representing the kinetic
coenergy of rotation of the disk (the kinetic coenergy of a rigid body is
the sum of the kinetic coenergy of translation of the total mass lumped at
the center of mass and the kinetic coenergy of rotation around the center
of mass):
T ∗= 1
2m( ˙q2
1 + ˙q2
2q2
1) + 1
2I ˙q2
2
The disk has the same potential energy as the point mass. Furthermore,
if the rod is uniform with a total mass M and a length l, its moment of
inertia with respect to the pivot is
Io =
Z l
0
̺x2dx = ̺l3/3 = Ml2/3
(M = ̺l); the additional contribution to the kinetic coenergy is Io ˙q2
2/2.
Note that, this includes the translational energy as well as the rotational
energy of the rod, because the moment of inertia I0 refers to the ﬁxed
point at the pivot. The bar has also an additional contribution to the
potential energy: −m g l cos q2/2 (the center of mass is at mid length).

1.7.4 Example 2: Rotating pendulum
Consider the rotating pendulum of Figure 1.9(a). The point mass m is
connected by a massless rod to a pivot which rotates about a vertical axis
at constant velocity Ω; the system is in a vertical gravity ﬁeld g. Because
Ωis constant, the system has a single d.o.f., with coordinate θ. In order
to write the kinetic coenergy, it is convenient to project the velocity of
the point mass in the orthogonal frame shown in Fig.1.9(b). One axis is
tangent to the circular trajectory when the pendulum rotates about the
vertical axis with θ ﬁxed, while the other one is tangent to the trajectory
of the mass in the plane of the pendulum when it does not rotate about
the vertical axis; the projected components are respectively lΩsin θ and
l ˙θ. Being orthogonal, it follows that
T ∗= m
2
h
(l ˙θ)2 + (lΩsin θ)2i
Note that the ﬁrst term is quadratic in ˙θ [T2∗in (1.39)], while the second
term is independent of ˙θ and appears as a potential of centrifugal forces
[T0∗in (1.39)]. Taking the reference altitude at the pivot, the gravity
potential is V = −gml cos θ and
L = T ∗−V = m
2
h
(l ˙θ)2 + (lΩsin θ)2i
+ gml cos θ
The corresponding Lagrange equation reads

1.7 Lagrange’s equations
23
ml2¨θ −ml2Ω2 sin θ cos θ + mgl sin θ = 0
For small oscillations near θ = 0, the equation can be simpliﬁed using the
approximations sin θ ≃θ and cos θ = 1; this leads to
¨θ + g
l θ −Ω2θ = 0
Introducing ω2
0 = g

One sees that the centrifugal force introduces a negative stiﬀness. Figure
1.9(c) shows the evolution of the frequency of the small oscillations of the
pendulum with Ω; the system is unstable beyond Ω= ω0.
1.7.5 Example 3: Rotating spring mass system
A spring mass system is rotating in the horizontal plane at a constant
velocity Ω, Fig.1.10(a). The system has a single d.o.f., described by the
coordinate u measuring the extension of the spring. The absolute velocity
of the point mass m can be conveniently projected in the moving frame
(x, y); the components are ( ˙u, uΩ). It follows that
T ∗= 1
2m
h
˙u2 + (uΩ)2i
Once again, there is a quadratic contribution, T2∗, and a contribution in-
dependent of the generalized velocity, T0∗(potential of centrifugal force).
It is not necessary to include the kinetic coenergy of the rotating mecha-
nism, because it is constant, and will disappear when writing the Lagrange
equation. Since the system is not subjected to gravity, the potential en-
ergy is associated with the extension of the spring; assuming that the
spring force is equal to zero when u = 0,
V = 1
2ku2
The Lagrangian reads
L = T ∗−V = 1
2m ˙u2 −1
2(k −mΩ2)u2

m¨u + (k −mΩ2)u = 0
or
¨u + (ω2

after introducing ω2
n = k/m. This equation is identical to the linearized
form of the previous example; the system becomes unstable for Ω> ωn.

1.7.6 Example 4: Gyroscopic eﬀects
Next, consider the system of Fig.1.10(b), where the constraint along y = 0
has been removed and replaced by another spring orthogonal to the pre-
vious one. This system has 2 d.o.f.; it is fully described by the generalized
coordinates x and y, the displacements along the moving axes rotating
at constant speed Ω. We assume small displacements and, in Fig.1.10(b),
the stiﬀness k1 and k2 represent the global stiﬀness along x and y, respec-
tively. We assume viscous damping along x, with damping coeﬃcient c1.
The absolute velocity in the rotating frame is ( ˙x −Ωy, ˙y + Ωx), leading
to the kinetic coenergy of the point mass
T ∗= 1
2m
h
( ˙x −Ωy)2 + ( ˙y + Ωx)2i
As in the previous example, we disregard the constant term associated

system of Fig.1.10(b) is actually the simplest, where gyroscopic forces
can be illustrated]. The potential V is associated with the extension of

example, the system does not become unstable beyond Ω= ωn; it is sta-

1.8 Lagrange’s equations with constraints
Consider the case where the n generalized coordinates are not indepen-
dent. In this case, the virtual changes of conﬁguration δqk must satisfy a
set of m constraint equations of the form of Equ.(1.18):
X

alkδqk = 0
l = 1, ...m

The number of degrees of freedom of the system is n −m. In Hamilton’s
principle (1.45), the variations δqi are no longer arbitrary, because of
Equ.(1.59), and the step leading from Equ.(1.45) to (1.46) is impossible.
This diﬃculty can be solved by using Lagrange multipliers. The technique
consists of adding to the variational indicator a linear combination of the
constraint equations

the Lagrange multipliers λl). Combining with the m constraints equations,
we obtain a set of n + m equations. For non-holonomic constraints of the

1.9 Conservation laws
1.9.1 Jacobi integral
If the generalized coordinates are independent, the Lagrange equations
constitute a set of n diﬀerential equations of the second order; their so-
lution requires 2n initial conditions describing the conﬁguration and the
velocity at t = 0. In special circumstances, the system admits ﬁrst inte-
grals of the motion, which contain derivatives of the variables of one order
lower than the order of the diﬀerential equations. The most celebrated of
these ﬁrst integrals is that of conservation of energy (1.23); it is a partic-
ular case of a more general relationship known as a Jacobi integral.
If the system is conservative (Qk = 0) and if the Lagrangian does not
depend explicitly on time,

Recall that the Lagrangian reads

(1.68)
where T ∗
2 is a homogenous quadratic function of ˙qk, T ∗

linear in ˙qk, and T ∗
0 and V do not depend on ˙qk.

and (1.67) can be rewritten
h = T ∗
2 −T ∗
0 + V = Ct
(1.70)
This result is known as a Jacobi integral, or also a Painlev´e integral. If
the kinetic coenergy is a homogeneous quadratic function of the velocity,
T ∗= T ∗
2 and T ∗
0 = 0; Equ.(1.70) becomes
T ∗+ V = Ct
(1.71)
which is the integral of conservation of energy. From the above discussion,
it follows that it applies to conservative systems whose Lagrangian does
not depend explicitly on time [Equ.(1.65)] and whose kinetic coenergy is a
homogeneous quadratic function of the generalized velocities (T ∗= T ∗
2 ).
We have met this equation earlier [Equ.(1.23)], and it is interesting to
relate the above conditions to the earlier ones: Indeed, (1.65) implies that
the potential does not depend explicitly on t, and T ∗= T ∗
2 implies that
the kinematical constraints do not depend explicitly on t [see (1.38) and
(1.39)].
1.9.2 Ignorable coordinate
Another ﬁrst integral can be obtained if a generalized coordinate (say qs)
does not appear explicitly in the Lagrangian of a conservative system (the
Lagrangian contains ˙qs but not qs, so that ∂L/∂qs = 0). Such a coordinate
is called ignorable. From Lagrange’s equation (1.46),

1.9 Conservation laws

∂˙qs

It follows that

and, since V does not depend explicitly on the velocities, this can be
rewritten
ps = ∂L
∂˙qs
= ∂T ∗
∂˙qs
= Ct
(1.72)
ps is the generalized momentum conjugate to qs [by analogy with (1.10)].
Thus, the generalized momentum associated with an ignorable coordinate
is conserved.
Note that the existence of the ﬁrst integral (1.72) depends very much
on the choice of coordinates, and that it may remain hidden if inappropri-
ate coordinates are used. The ignorable coordinates are also called cyclic,
because they often happen to be rotational coordinates.

1 Lagrangian dynamics of mechanical systems
1.9.3 Example: The spherical pendulum
To illustrate the previous paragraph, consider the spherical pendulum of
Fig.1.12. Its conﬁguration is entirely characterized by the two generalized
coordinates θ and φ. the kinetic coenergy and the potential energy are
respectively
T ∗= 1
2m[(l ˙θ)2 + ( ˙φl sin θ)2]
V = −mgl cos θ
and the Lagrangian reads
L = T ∗−V = 1
2ml2[ ˙θ2 + ( ˙φ sin θ)2] + mgl cos θ
The Lagrangian does not depend explicitly on t, nor on the coordinate
φ. The system is therefore eligible for the two ﬁrst integrals discussed
above. Since the kinetic energy is homogeneous quadratic in ˙θ and ˙φ, the
conservation of energy (1.71) applies.
As for the ignorable coordinate φ, the conjugate generalized momen-
tum is
pφ = ∂T ∗/∂˙φ = ml2 ˙φ sin2 θ = Ct
This equation simply states the conservation of the angular momentum
about the vertical axis Oz (indeed, the moments about Oz of the external
forces from the cable of the pendulum and the gravity vanish).

In this section, additional aspects of continuous systems are discussed.
The sections on the Green tensor and the geometric stiﬀness are more
specialized and may be skipped without jeopardizing the understanding

The Rayleigh-Ritz method, also called Assumed Modes method, is an ap-
proximation which allows us to transform a partial diﬀerential equation
into a set of ordinary diﬀerential equations; in other words, it allows us
to represent a continuous system by a discrete approximation, which is

33
expected to approximate the low frequency behavior of the continuous
system. To achieve this, it is assumed that the displacement ﬁeld (as-
sumed one-dimensional here for simplicity, but the approximation applies
in three dimensions as well) can be written
v(x, t) =
n
X
i=1
ψi(x) qi(t)
(1.73)
where ψi(x) are a set of assumed modes, which are continuous and satisfy
the geometric boundary conditions (but not the natural boundary con-
ditions). The n functions of time qi(t) are the generalized coordinates of
the approximate discrete system. If the set of assumed modes is complete
(such as Fourier series, or power series), the approximation converges to-
wards the exact solution as their number n increases.
To illustrate this method, let us return to the lateral vibration of the
Euler-Bernoulli beam. If the transverse displacement is approximated by
(1.73), the strain energy (1.30) can be readily transformed into

The reader familiar with the ﬁnite element method will recognize the form

are deﬁned over the entire structure and satisfy the geometric boundary
conditions. K and M are symmetric, so that V and T ∗exactly ﬁt the forms
discussed in section 1.7.1, leading to the diﬀerential equation (1.50). Note
also that, if the trial functions ψi(x) are the vibration modes φi(x) of
the system, K and M as deﬁned by (1.75) and (1.77) are both diagonal,
because of the orthogonality of the mode shapes, and a set of decoupled
equations is obtained.
1.10.2 General continuous system
Anticipating the analysis of piezoelectric structures of chapter 4, we use
the notation Sij for the strain tensor and Tij for the stress tensor; these
are the standard notations for piezoelectric structures. With these nota
tions, the constitutive equations of a linear elastic material are
Tij = cijklSkl
(1.78)
where cijkl is the tensor of elastic constants. The strain energy density
reads
U(Sij) =
Z Sij
0
TijdSij
(1.79)
from which the constitutive equation may be rewritten
Tij = ∂U

(1.80)
For a linear elastic material

(1.81)
1.10.3 Green strain tensor
For many problems in mechanical engineering (e.g. the beam theory of
section 1.6.1), it is suﬃcient to consider the inﬁnitesimal deﬁnition of
strain of linear elasticity. However, problems involving large displacements
and prestresses cannot be handled in this way and require a strain mea-
sure invariant with respect to the global rotation of the system. In other
words, a rigid body motion should produce Sij = 0. Such a representa-
tion is supplied by the Green strain tensor, which is deﬁned as follows:
Consider a continuous body and let AB be a segment connecting two
-

1.10 More on continuous systems
35
points before deformation, and A′B′ be the same segment after deforma-
tion; the coordinates are respectively: A : xi, B : xi + dxi, A′ : xi + ui,
B′ : xi +ui +d(xi +ui). If dl0 is the initial length of AB and dl the length
of A′B′, it is readily established that
dl2 −dl2
0 = ( ∂ui
∂xj
+ ∂uj
∂xi
+ ∂um
∂xi
∂um
∂xj
)dxidxj
(1.82)
The Green strain tensor is deﬁned as
Sij = 1
2( ∂ui
∂xj
+ ∂uj
∂xi
+ ∂um
∂xi
∂um
∂xj
)
(1.83)
It is symmetric, and its linear part is the classical strain measure in linear
elasticity; there is an additional quadratic part which accounts for large
rotations. Comparing the foregoing equations,
dl2 −dl2
0 = 2Sijdxidxj
(1.84)
which shows that if Sij = 0, the length of the segment is indeed un-
changed, even for large ui. The Green strain tensor accounts for large
rotations; it can be partitioned according to
Sij = S(1)
ij + S(2)
ij
(1.85)
where S(1)
ij
is linear in the displacements, and S(2)
ij
is quadratic.
1.10.4 Geometric strain energy due to prestress
The lateral stiﬀness of strings and cables is known to depend on their
axial tension force. Similarly, long rods subjected to large axial forces
have a modiﬁed lateral stiﬀness; compressive forces reduce the natural
frequency while traction forces increase it. When the axial compressive
load exceeds some threshold, the rod buckles, and the buckling load is
that which reduces the natural frequency to 0. The geometric stiﬀness is
important for structures subjected to large dead loads which contribute
signiﬁcantly to the strain energy of the system.
Consider a continuous system in a prestressed state (T 0
ij, S0
ij) indepen-
dent of time, and then subjected to a dynamic motion (T ∗
ij, S∗
ij). The total
stress and strain state is (Fig.1.13)
Sij = S0
ij + S∗
ij

(1.87)

(2)dΩ
(1.90)
is the geometric strain energy due to prestress involving the prestressed
state T 0
ij and the quadratic part of the strain tensor. Unlike V ∗which is
always positive, Vg may be positive or negative, depending on the sign of
the prestress. If Vg is positive, it tends to rigidify the system; it softens it
if it is negative, as illustrated below. For a discrete system, Vg takes the
general form
Vg = 1
2xT Kgx
(1.91)
where Kg is the geometric stiﬀness matrix, no longer positive deﬁnite since
Vg may be negative. The geometric stiﬀness is a signiﬁcant contributor
to the total stiﬀness of a rotating helicopter blade; the lowering of the
natural frequencies of civil engineering structures due to the dead loads
is often referred to as the
”
P-Delta” eﬀect.

v = 0

The axial preload at x is

(1.93)
and, assuming large rotations but small deformations,

(as in section 1.6.1), and the quadratic part

1.10.6 Example: Simply supported beam in compression
Consider a simply supported beam subjected to a constant axial compres-
sion load P. One can estimate the ﬁrst natural frequency of the system
with the Rayleigh-Ritz method, using a single mode approximation:
w = q sin πx
L
(1.98)
With this assumption, the Lagrangian reads
L = T ∗−(V ∗+ Vg) = ̺AL
4
˙q2 −[π4EI
4L3 −π2P
4L ]q2
(1.99)
Note that Vg contributes negatively to the potential energy because the
load P is compressive. The potential energy can be rearranged
V ∗+ Vg = q2.π4EI
4L3 [1 −PL2
π2EI ] = q2.π4EI
4L3 [1 −P
Pcr
]
(1.100)
where Pcr = π2EI/L2 is the well known Euler’s critical buckling load.
The Lagrangian (1.99) is that of a single d.o.f. oscillator; the correspond-
ing natural frequency is
ω2
1 = π4EI
̺AL4 .[1 −P
Pcr
]
(1.101)
The ﬁrst term is the exact value for a simply supported beam without
prestress, and the second term is the correction due to the axial loading.
One sees that a compressive load reduces ω1 and, when P reaches Pcr,
ω1 = 0; conversely, a traction load tends to increase ω1. The fact that the
exact value of the natural frequency has been obtained with an approxi-
mation technique is due to the fact that the assumed mode (1.98) is the
exact mode shape of the problem. Any other assumption (satisfying the
geometric boundary conditions) would have led to a larger value of the
ω1, because the Rayleigh-Ritz method tends to overestimate the natural
frequencies.

Dynamics of electrical networks
2.1 Introduction
Electrical networks are constituted of passive elements such as resistors,
capacitors and inductors, and active ones such as voltage and current
sources. The interconnection constraints on electrical networks are repre-
sented by Kirchhoﬀ’s rules:
Kirchhoﬀ’s current rule (KCR) stipulates that no electrical charge can
accumulate at a node in the network : the algebraic sum of the currents
entering any node must be zero.
Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage rule (KVR) translates the fact that the voltage
between any two points in a network is independent of the path through
the network : the algebraic sum of the voltage drops around any closed
loop in a network must be zero.
This chapter presents the variational approach for analyzing electrical
networks; this indirect approach can be used as an alternative to the direct
approach based on Kirchhoﬀ’s rules, but more importantly, it can be
combined with the variational approach to mechanical systems to analyze
the dynamics of electromechanical systems. The following discussion is
within the framework of quasi-static electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, which
assumes that the time variation of the electromagnetic ﬁeld is slow enough
to neglect the interaction between the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic ﬁeld.
This implies that the size of the device, l, is small in comparison to the
wavelength (l/λ ≪1).

2.2.1 The Capacitor
A capacitor is formed by two conducting surfaces separated by a dielectric
material (Fig.2.1). When charged, a electric charge of q Coulomb is added
to one surface, and taken away from the other surface. The current ﬂowing
through the capacitor is the rate of change of the charge in the capacitor:
i = dq
dt
(2.1)
In the process of charging a capacitor, a potential (voltage) diﬀerence e
is established between the conducting surfaces; the relationship between
e and q can be measured statically; it is the constitutive relation of the
capacitor, e(q) (Fig.2.1.b).
The electrical energy We(q) stored in a capacitor is the work done in
charging the capacitor from no charge to q. Since the power input is P =
ei (Fig 2.1.a),
We(q) =
Z t
0
ei dt =
Z q

(2.2)
This integral is the area below the curve in Fig.2.1.b. It follows that

2.2.2 The Inductor
When a current ﬂows in a conductor, a magnetic ﬁeld is produced around
the conductor, the strength of the ﬁeld is proportional to the current. Con-
versely, when a conductor encloses a region containing a magnetic ﬁeld,
a voltage is induced in the conductor when the magnetic ﬁeld changes.
These induction eﬀects are present in all conductors, but they become
very important if the conductor consists of closely packed coils with many
turns. In air, the magnetic behavior of a coil is linear (the ﬂux linkage λ
is proportional to the current i), but a ferromagnetic core is often added
to the coil to enhance the magnetic ﬂux density by several orders of mag-
nitude; the behavior of such coils is nonlinear and often hysteretic.
Faraday’s law states that the voltage developed across an inductor is
equal to the rate of change of ﬂux linkage λ

(2.10)
The unit of ﬂux linkage is the Weber or volt-second. In an ideal inductor,
the ﬂux linkage λ depends only on the instantaneous current; a constant
current produces a constant λ, so that e = 0. Thus, for a constant current,
the ideal inductor behaves as a perfect conductor (short-circuit). If the
inductor is linear,
λ = Li
(2.11)
where L is called inductance; its unit is the Henry or Weber per Ampere.
The magnetic energy Wm(λ) stored in an ideal inductor is the work done
on the inductor when its magnetic state is changed from no ﬂux linkage to
a ﬂux linkage λ. This work is evaluated by integrating the power delivered
to the circuit:

2 Dynamics of electrical networks
An ideal voltage source produces a time history of voltage independent
of the current ﬂowing through it. An ideal current source produces a
prescribed time history of current independent of the voltage across its
terminals. A real source behaves as represented in Fig.2.3.a; it has a linear
characteristic, between the maximum voltage E0 when the terminals are
open, and the maximum current I0 when the terminals are short circuited.
es = E0 −E0

A real source can be modelled by ideal sources combined with resistors; in
Fig 2.3.b, an ideal voltage source is connected in series with a resistance
R, leading to the characteristic
es = E0 −Ris
Alternatively, combining a current source I0 in parallel with a resistance
R, one gets the characteristics
es = RI0 −Ris
Thanks to modern power electronics, it is possible to build voltage am-
pliﬁers which behave nearly as a perfect voltage source in a given fre-
quency range, and current ampliﬁers which behave nearly as perfect
current sources in a given frequency range.
2.3 Kirchhoﬀ’s laws
Electrical networks are constructed by interconnecting passive elements
and sources. The interconnections between the elements produce con-
straints between the variables describing the individual elements; these
interconnection laws are known as Kirchhoﬀ’s laws.
Kirchhoﬀ’s current rule (KCR) state that the sum of the currents
ﬂowing into any node must be zero. It is a statement of conservation of
electric charge and reﬂects the fact that electric charge cannot accumulate
at a node of the network.
Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage rule (KVR) state that the sum of the voltage drops
across every element along a closed loop must be zero. This reﬂects the
fact that the electric potential at any point is independent of the path
followed to reach that point.
In the analysis of a passive network, the following requirements must
be satisﬁed;
.

2.4 Hamilton’s principle for electrical networks
47
1. Requirements on current variables ik (coming from KCR), which can
be expressed alternatively with charge variables qk satisfying
dqk
dt = ik
2. Requirements on voltage variables, ek (coming from KVR), which can
be expressed alternatively with ﬂux linkage variables λk satisfying
dλk
dt = ek
3. The constitutive equations of individual elements.
The direct method for formulating the dynamic equations of a passive
network consists in stating all these requirements analytically. This can
be done in either of the following ways.
(a) With independent charge variables qi, the solution is achieved in
three steps:
•
Express all current and charges in terms of the independent charge
variables qi (using the KCR).
•
Use the constitutive equations to express the voltage or ﬂux linkage
across all elements in terms of qi.
•
Use the KVR to obtain a complete set of equations.
(b) A complementary procedure uses a set of independent ﬂux linkages
λk as independent variables, the solution in three steps proceeds as follows:
•
Express all the ﬂux linkages and voltages in terms of the independent
λk (using the KVR).
•
use the constitutive equations to express the currents and charges in
all circuit elements in terms of λk.
•
use the KCR to obtain a complete set of equations.
We shall not pursue the direct approach any further, but rather focus on
indirect, variational methods, based on Hamilton’s principle.
2.4 Hamilton’s principle for electrical networks
In Hamilton’s principle, a variational indicator is constructed from the
constitutive equations of the network elements. Admissible variations are
deﬁned, which satisfy one set of Kirchhoﬀ’s rules, and the stationarity of

48
2 Dynamics of electrical networks
the variational indicator amounts to satisfying the other set of Kirchhoﬀ’s
rules. There are two dual forms of Hamilton’s principle, depending on the
choice of independent variables. In one form, the independent variables are
the charges qi satisfying the KCR, and in the other form, the independent
variables are the ﬂux linkages λi satisfying the KVR.
In the previous chapter, it was argued that being a fundamental law of
physics, Hamilton’s principle does not have to be derived, just accepted.
We could therefore proceed by ﬁrst stating the principle for electrical
networks and next showing that it implies Kirchhoﬀ’s rules. We believe,
however, that some kind of derivation, even if it is not in its most general
form, will contribute to its understanding. The reader willing to accept
Hamilton’s principle without discussion may skip the developments of the
two following sections and focus on the ﬁnal results (2.25) and (2.32).
2.4.1 Hamilton’s principle, charge formulation
In this formulation, the generalized variables are the charges and currents.
Admissible variations δqi must satisfy Kirchhoﬀ’s current rules, and the
current and charges variables must satisfy ik = ˙qk = dqk/dt.
By analogy with Equ.(1.22), we can write the virtual work expression
M
X
i=1
(ei −dλi

(2.19)
where M is the number of circuit elements. The ﬁrst contribution to this
sum can be separated into its conservative and non-conservative parts;
M

i=1
eiδqi = −δWe +

Ekδqk
(2.20)
We is the electrical energy function of the system, and Ek represents the
generalized voltage corresponding to the nonconservative elements and
conjugate to the independent generalized charge variable qk. ne is the
number of independent generalized charge coordinates. The negative sign
on δWe is due to the fact that when the voltage across a conservative cir-
cuit element does work on the circuit, the electrical energy in the element
decreases. The second contribution to the sum (2.19) can be rewritten

The ﬁrst term in the right hand side is a total time derivative which, as
we did in section 1.6, can be eliminated by integrating over some interval
[t1, t2] assuming that the system conﬁguration is known at t1 and t2, so
that
δqi(t1) = δqi(t2) = 0

after permuting d/dt and δ, and using (2.17). Finally, integrating (2.19)

(2.23), one gets

The actual path is that which cancels the variational indicator (2.25) with
respect to all admissible charge variations δqi of the path between two
instants t1 and t2, and such that δqi(t1) = δqi(t2) = 0.
W ∗
m is the magnetic coenergy function of the network, that is the
sum of all magnetic coenergies of individual inductors in the network,
expressed in terms of the currents ij; We is the electrical energy function
of the network, that is the sum of all electrical energies of individual
capacitors in the network, expressed in terms of qj. To be admissible,
the current and charges must satisfy Kirchhoﬀ’s current law and must
satisfy ij = dqj/dt. W ∗
m - We is the Lagrangian of the network. There is a
complete analogy between (2.25) and (1.26); P Ekδqk corresponds to the
virtual work of the nonconservative elements, denoted δWnc in (1.26).
2.4.2 Hamilton’s principle, ﬂux linkage formulation
We now examine the dual formulation, where the generalized variables
are ﬂux linkages λk and voltages ek. Admissible variations must satisfy
Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage rule, and the ﬂux linkage and voltage variables must
satisfy ek = dλk/dt.
By analogy with (2.19), the virtual work expression reads

The actual path is that which cancels the variational indicator (2.32) with
respect to all admissible ﬂux linkage variations δλk of the path between
two instants t1 and t2, and such that δλk(t1) = δλk(t2) = 0.
W ∗
e is the electrical coenergy function of the network, that is the sum of
all electrical coenergies of individual capacitors in the network, expressed
in terms of the voltage ek; Wm is the magnetic energy function of the
network, that is the sum of all magnetic energies of individual inductors in
the network, expressed in terms of the independent ﬂux linkage variables
λk. To be admissible, the voltage and ﬂux linkages must satisfy Kirchhoﬀ’s
voltage rule and must satisfy ek = dλk/dt. W ∗
e −Wm is the Lagrangian
of the network in this formulation.
2.4.3 Discussion
Hamilton’s principle for mechanical systems and for electrical networks
takes remarkably similar forms. The Lagrangian consists of the coenergy,
which depends on the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates,
minus the energy, which depends on the generalized coordinates, but not
on their time derivatives.
For mechanical systems,
L = T ∗( ˙qi) −V (qi)
qi ≡generalized displacements
For electrical networks,

qk = electric charge,
ik = ˙qk
(b) ﬂux linkage formulation
L = W ∗
e (ek) −Wm(λk)
λk = ﬂux linkage,
ek = ˙λk
The virtual work of the nonconservative elements reads, respectively
δWnc = Qiδqi
Qi = generalized force
δWnc = Ekδqk
Ek = generalized voltage
δWnc = Ikδλk
Ik = generalized current

2 Dynamics of electrical networks
These work expressions are positive if the element supplies energy to the
network under the variation, and negative if the element absorbs energy.
With the positive directions assumed in Fig.2.4, a resistor R is such that
e = −Ri
The virtual work expression in the charge formulation is
e δq = −Ri δq = −R ˙q δq
and, in the ﬂux linkage formulation,
i δλ = −e
Rδλ = −1
R
˙λ δλ
An ideal voltage source E(t) will contribute
e δq = E(t)δq
in the charge formulation, but there is no contribution in the ﬂux linkage
formulation, because, the time history of the voltage being prescribed
at any time, it cannot be altered in any admissible variation of voltage
or ﬂux linkage. Although they do not enter the virtual work expression,
the voltage sources do enter the ﬂux linkage formulation of Hamilton’s
principle as part of the admissibility requirements on voltages and ﬂux
linkages.
Nonconservative element
e = dõ=dt
i = dq=dt
Fig. 2.4. The virtual work increment delivered to the network by the element is e δq
or i δλ.
The same considerations apply to an ideal current source I(t) which
contributes for I(t)δλ to the virtual work expression in the ﬂux linkage
formulation, but do not contribute in the charge formulation because no
variation of current is allowed where it is prescribed. In this latter case,
the current sources enter the charge formulation of Hamilton’s principle
as part of the admissibility requirements.

2.5 Lagrange’s equations
Consider a discrete lumped parameter network. Because of the similar-
ity between the formulation of Hamilton’s principle for electrical net-
works and mechanical systems, one can skip the analytical derivation
of Lagrange’s equations from Hamilton’s principle, which follows almost
identically that of section 1.7. The most convenient way to satisfy the
admissibility conditions on the virtual variations is to select a complete
set of independent generalized coordinates. In this way, the admissibility
requirements are automatically satisﬁed.
2.5.1 Lagrange’s equations, charge formulation
In the charge formulation of Lagrange’s equations, n generalized charge
coordinates, qk, are selected such that their time derivatives, ˙qk, constitute
independent loop currents in the network. The Lagrangian is
L( ˙qk, qk) = W ∗
m( ˙qk) −We(qk)
(2.33)
where W ∗
m( ˙qk) is the magnetic coenergy of the network, expressed in terms
of the independent loop currents; it is equal to the sum of magnetic co-
energies of individual inductors in the network. We(qk) is the electrical
energy of the network, expressed in terms of the independent charge vari-
ables; it is equal to the sum of electrical energies of individual capacitors
in the network. The virtual work of the nonconservative elements is ex-
pressed in terms of the independent generalized coordinates according to
the work equality

where the sum in the left hand side extends to the independent gen-
eralized coordinates and that in the right hand side extends to all the

(2.34)
where Ek is the generalized voltage associated with the generalized charge

2.5.2 Lagrange’s equations, ﬂux linkage formulation
The ﬂux linkage formulation is dual of the charge formulation; n indepen-
dent ﬂux linkage coordinates λk are selected, which automatically satisfy
Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage rule. The Lagrangian is
L( ˙λk, λk) = W ∗
e ( ˙λk) −Wm(λk)
(2.35)
where W ∗
e ( ˙λk) is the electrical coenergy of the network expressed in terms
of the independent voltages
˙λk; it is equal to the sum of the electrical
coenergies of all capacitors in the network, expressed in terms of voltage
variables. Wm(λk) is the magnetic energy of the network, expressed in
terms of the independent ﬂux linkage variables; it is equal to the sum
of magnetic energies of all inductors in the network. The virtual work of
the nonconservative elements is expressed in terms of the generalized ﬂux
linkage coordinates thanks to the work equality
X

Ik δλk =

where the sum in the left side extends to the independent ﬂux-linkage
generalized coordinates and that in the right hand side extends to all
nonconservative elements. The resulting Lagrange’s equations are

2.5.3 Example 1
Consider the electrical network of Fig.2.5. We shall write the dynamic
equations of the network using successively the ﬂux linkage formulation
and the charge formulation.
Flux linkage formulation
We select ﬂux linkage coordinates λi at all ungrounded nodes; this leads
to 3 independent coordinates λ1, λ2, λ3. Since the voltage drops across the
capacitors C1 and C2 are respectively ˙λ2 −˙λ1 and ˙λ3 −˙λ2. The electrical
coenergy reads

On the other hand, the virtual work of the nonconservative elements is

The ﬁrst contribution is that of the ideal current generator, and the sec-
ond is that of the resistor R (the current in the resistor is ˙λ3/R, and the
virtual work is negative because it is a dissipative element). The general-
ized currents in the Lagrange’s equations are respectively I1 = 0, I2 = I
and I3 = −˙λ3/R.

Fig. 2.6. Electrical network, charge formulation.
Charge formulation
We reexamine the problem with a charge formulation. Accordingly, a set
of loops is deﬁned (two in this case), and charge variables q1 and q2 are
associated with every loop, so that ˙q1 and ˙q2 are the loop currents (the
positive direction clockwise adopted in Fig.2.6 is arbitrary). In this case,
the two currents ˙q1 and ˙q2 are not independent, because of the current
generator; they must satisfy the admissibility condition
˙q2 = ˙q1 + I(t) = ˙q1 + ˙q0
where I(t) = ˙q0. Integrating, one gets
q2 = q1 + q0
We note that q0 is not a variable, but rather an input to the system
(q0 is the electric charge injected by the current source). It follows that
the virtual charge variations are subjected to δq2 = δq1, and that this
formulation has a single generalized coordinate q1. The Lagrangian reads

example mixes ideal voltage and current sources, and it will be useful to
compare the way they contribute to virtual work of the nonconservative
elements. We will restrict ourselves to writing the Lagrangian and the
virtual work of the nonconservative elements, since Lagrange’s equations
can easily be derived from them.

2 Dynamics of electrical networks
Charge formulation
The current loops are deﬁned as indicated in Fig.2.7. Because of the pres-
ence of the current source, the current ˙q2 and ˙q3 are not independent;
they must satisfy the admissibility condition
˙q3 = ˙q2 + I = ˙q2 + ˙q0
where I(t) = ˙q0. It follows that
q3 = q2 + q0
and
δq3 = δq2
since q0 is not subject to virtual variations. The contributions of all the

Note that the current source does not contribute to δWnc, but it appears
in both W ∗

3.1 Introduction
The two preceding chapters have addressed separately the dynamics of
mechanical systems and the dynamics of the electrical network. In this
chapter, we consider the dynamics of composite systems formed by in-
terconnecting mechanical and electrical variables. The central element in
this interconnection is the conversion of mechanical energy into electri-
cal energy, and vice versa, which takes place in electromechanical trans-
ducers. Electromechanical transducers are pervasive in modern life, they
include microphones, loudspeakers, electrical motors, magnetic suspen-
sions, capacitive accelerometers, and also microelectromechanical systems
(MEMS). Piezoelectric transducers will be treated in a separate chapter.
This chapter starts with a review of the constitutive equations of the
most frequent lossless lumped parameter electromechanical transducers.
It is followed by the statement of Hamilton’s principle for electromechan-
ical systems, the Lagrange equations, and a set of examples where the
dynamic equations governing a few classical electromechanical systems
are established.
3.2 Constitutive relations for transducers
A conservative transducer is a transducer which conserves energy, it is
also called lossless. There are two types of transducers, those which can
store energy and those which can only transfer energy from one form to
the other, without being able to store it. In a transducer which can store
energy, the energy can be stored in one form (either mechanically or elec-
trically) and recovered at a later time in another form. On the contrary,

a transfer element transforms one form of energy into the other form,
but the instantaneous power at the input is always equal to the instanta-
neous power at the output. The theory of lumped parameter transducers
is based on the quasi-static theory of electromagnetism, which assumes
that the physical dimension of the device, l, is much smaller than the
electromagnetic wavelength (l/λ ≪1). Under this assumption, the ﬁeld
that produces forces in the transducer is either electrical or magnetic,
but not both; this allows us to separate the analysis of electrical forces in
capacitive transducers, and magnetic forces in inductive transducers.
Note that the electrostatic and electromagnetic forces do not scale
down in the same way as the size of the transducer shrinks : the electro-
static forces tend to scale down as l−2 and the electrostatic energy as l−3,
while the electromagnetic forces scale down as l−4 and the electromag-
netic energy as l−5. This is why electrostatic transducers are much more
used in MEMS.

3.2.1 Movable-plate capacitor
A movable plate capacitor is a conservative energy storing transducer
which allows electrical energy to be transformed into mechanical energy
and vice versa (Fig.3.1). The charge on the capacitor is q and the voltage
across the plates is e; the displacement of the movable plate is x and the
external force required to hold the movable plate in equilibrium against
the electrostatic attraction force is f. The electromechanical transducer
is assumed to be perfect, meaning that the electrical side is a pure capac-

itance, and the mechanical construction is massless and without stiﬀness
or damping.
If one takes the movable plate displacement x and the electrical charge
q as independent variables, the constitutive relations for a movable-plate
capacitor can be given in the form of equations for the voltage and force
in terms of x and q:
e = e(x, q)
f = f(x, q)
(3.1)
The exact form of these equations can be determined either from the
electrostatic ﬁeld theory, or they can be determined experimentally; they
must be such that when q = 0, there is no electric ﬁeld and the force f
must be zero for all x:
f(x, 0) = 0
(3.2)
The total power delivered to the capacitor is the sum of the electric power,
ei, and the mechanical power, fv. The net work on the capacitor over dt
is therefore
dW = ei dt + fv dt = e dq + f dx
(3.3)
For a conservative element, this work is converted into stored electrical
energy, dWe, and the total electrical energy We(x, q) (it is called electri-
cal, although it includes both electrical and mechanical work) is obtained
by integrating (3.3) from the reference state to (x, q). Once the electri-
cal energy function We(x, q) is known, the constitutive equations can be
recovered by diﬀerentiation :
∂We
∂x = f
∂We
∂q
= e
(3.4)
As in the previous chapter, the complementary state function called elec-
trical coenergy function is deﬁned by the Legendre transformation
W ∗
e (x, e) = eq −We(x, q)
(3.5)
The total diﬀerential of the coenergy is
dW ∗
e = q de + e dq −∂We

x, neglecting the edge eﬀect, C(x) = εA/x, where ε is the dielectric con-
stant of the material between the plates and A is the area of the plate).
The electrical energy function We(q, x) can be obtained by integrating
(3.3) from the reference state to (q, x). For a conservative system, this in-
tegral is independent of the path followed. If one takes a path consisting
of two straight lines (0, 0) →(x, 0) and (x, 0) →(x, q) as indicated in Fig
3.2, we can use the fact that f = 0 and e = 0 over the ﬁrst segment, and
that dx = 0 over the second one, leading to

3.2.2 Movable-core inductor
An ideal movable-core inductor is another conservative energy-storing
transducer; it is the magnetic counterpart of the movable-plate capaci-
tor. We use the notation of Fig.3.3, where λ is the ﬂux linkage of the coil,
e the voltage at the input, i the input current, x the displacement of the
iron core and f the external force required to hold the core in equilibrium
against the magnetic attraction. Proceeding as with the movable-plate ca-
pacitor, we assume that the electrical side is a perfect inductor, without
hysteresis, and that the mechanical construction is massless and without
friction. Taking the ﬂux linkage λ and the displacement x as independent
variables, we can write the constitutive equations in the form of equations
for i and f in terms of λ and x:

66
i = i(x, λ)
f = f(x, λ)
(3.12)
The exact form of the constitutive equations can be determined either
from electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, or from experiments; without hystere-
sis, (3.12) are assumed to be single-valued functions. Their form must be
such that, when λ = 0, there is no magnetic ﬁeld and no magnetic attrac-
tion. Therefore, the force f balancing the magnetic attraction must be 0
for all x:
f(x, 0) = 0
(3.13)
The total power delivered to the solenoid is the sum of all the electrical
power, ei, and the mechanical power, fv. The net work on the solenoid
over dt is therefore
dW = ei dt + fv dt = i dλ + f dx
(3.14)
For a conservative transducer, this work is converted into stored magnetic
energy of the solenoid, dWm. If the stored magnetic energy is expressed
in terms of the independent variables, Wm(x, λ),
dWm = ∂Wm
∂λ dλ + ∂Wm
∂x dx
(3.15)
and, by comparison with (3.14), one recovers the constitutive equations
i = ∂Wm

f = ∂Wm

(3.16)
If the system is conservative, the total stored magnetic energy is obtained
by integrating (3.14) along any path from the reference state to (x, λ).
As for the movable plate capacitor, the magnetic coenergy function is
deﬁned by the Legendre transformation
W ∗
m(x, i) = iλ −Wm(x, λ)
(3.17)

(3.16), one ﬁnds an alternative form of the constitutive equations

where L(x) is the inductance of the coil when the core is in the position x.
In this case, one can evaluate the magnetic stored energy Wm(x, λ) explic-

vative system, this integral is independent of the path, and one can take
the path consisting of two straight lines (0, 0) →(x, 0) and (x, 0) →(x, λ)
(Fig 3.4). Using the fact that f = 0, if λ = 0, one gets

3.2.3 Moving-coil transducer
A moving-coil transducer is an energy transformer which converts elec-
trical power into mechanical power and vice versa. The system consists
of a permanent magnet (Fig.3.5) which produces a uniform magnetic ﬂux
density B normal to the gap, and a coil which is free to move axially
within the gap. Let v be the velocity of the coil, f the external force act-
ing to maintain the coil in equilibrium against the electromagnetic forces,
e the voltage diﬀerence across the coil and i the current into the coil.
In this ideal transducer, we neglect the electrical resistance and the self
inductance of the coil, as well as its mass and damping (if necessary, these
can be handled by adding R and L to the electrical circuit of the coil, or
a mass and damper to its mechanical model). The voice coil actuator is
one of the most popular actuators in mechatronics (e.g. it is used in elec-
tromagnetic loudspeakers), but we ﬁnd it also as a sensor in, for example,
geophones.
The constitutive equations of the moving-coil transducer follow from
Faraday’s law and the Lorentz force law. Faraday’s law states that the
voltage increment de over some elementary length dl in the direction of
the current ﬂow, induced by the motion of the coil is
de = ⃗v × ⃗B.⃗dl
(3.24)

3.2 Constitutive relations for transducers

On the other hand, a charge particle moving in an electromagnetic ﬁeld
(electric ﬁeld ⃗E and magnetic ﬂux density ⃗B) is subjected to the Lorentz
force
⃗f = q( ⃗E + ⃗v × ⃗B)
(3.25)
In the macroscopic world, this force is dominated by its magnetic contri-
bution, and the electrostatic contribution can be omitted. If we consider
a current formed by a very large number of charged particles (the elec-
trons) moving along the conductor, the total force of the ﬁeld acting on
an elementary length dl of the conductor is
⃗df = i⃗dl × ⃗B
(3.26)
Applying (3.24) to an elementary length dl = rdθ of one turn of the coil
[ ⃗B, ⃗v and ⃗dl are mutually orthogonal, Fig.3.5.(b)], one ﬁnds that the
voltage increment in the direction of the current ﬂow is
de = ⃗v × ⃗B.⃗dl = −vBrdθ
Integrating over θ, assuming that B is uniform in the gap, the voltage
drop in the coil, in the direction of the current, is
e = 2πnrBv = Tv
(3.27)
where
T = 2πnrB
(3.28)
is the transducer constant, equal to the product of the length of the coil
exposed to the magnetic ﬂux, 2πnr, and the magnetic ﬂux density B.
On the other hand, the Lorentz force of the magnetic ﬁeld acting on the
element dl = rdθ of one turn of the coil with a current i follows from
(3.26).
df = irdθB
(3.29)
The force f deﬁned in Fig.3.5(a) is the external force required to balance
the total force of the magnetic ﬁeld on n turns of the conductor; integrat-
ing (3.29) over the length of the conductor exposed to the magnetic ﬂux
density, one ﬁnds
f = −i 2πnrB = −Ti
(3.30)
where T is again the transducer constant (3.28). Equ.(3.27) and (3.30)
are the constitutive equations of the movable-coil transducer (Fig.3.6).

Notice that the transducer constant T appearing in Faraday’s law (3.27),
expressed in volt.sec/m, is the same as that appearing in the Lorentz
force (3.30), expressed in N/Amp.
The total power delivered to the moving-coil transducer is equal to the
sum of the electric power, ei, and the mechanical power, fv. Combining
with (3.27) and (3.30), one gets
ei + fv = Tvi −Tiv = 0
(3.31)
Thus, at any time, there is an equilibrium between the electrical power
absorbed by the device and the mechanical power delivered (and vice
versa). The moving-coil transducer cannot store energy, and behaves as a
perfect electromechanical converter. In practice, however, the transfer is
never perfect due to eddy currents, ﬂux leakage and magnetic hysteresis,
leading to diﬀerent values of T in (3.27) and (3.30).
Proceeding as for the movable core inductor, it follows from (3.31) that
the magnetic energy Wm remains constant, equal to its reference value
that can be taken as Wm = 0. The constitutive equation (3.27) can be
written equivalently in terms of ﬂux linkage
λ = T(x −x0)
(3.32)
where x0 is an arbitrary reference state. This allows us to write the coen-
ergy function (3.17)

m(x, i) = λi −Wm(x, λ) = Ti(x −x0)

3.3 Hamilton’s
rinciple
71
In this section, the constitutive equations for ideal transducers have been
discussed. The models of real transducers usually involve additional el-
ements on the electrical side as well as on the mechanical side of the
transducer, to represent the electrical resistance, capacitance and induc-
tance, and the mechanical inertia, stiﬀness and damping; we will see a few
examples shortly. Before that, we shall examine how the dynamic equa-
tions of electromechanical systems can be derived from a general form of
Hamilton’s principle and the Lagrange equations.
3.3 Hamilton’s
rinciple
Hamilton’s principle has been examined for mechanical systems and elec-
trical networks in the previous chapters. A single formulation based on
virtual displacements compatible with the kinematical constraints has
been examined for mechanical systems, while two dual approaches have
been considered for electrical networks; the charge formulation is based on
admissible charge variations compatible with Kirchhoﬀ’s current rule, and
the ﬂux linkage formulation is based on admissible ﬂux linkage variations
compatible with Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage rule. In all cases, the Lagrangian was
deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the coenergy function (which depends
on the time derivatives of the generalized coordinates) and the energy
function (which depends on the generalized coordinates but not on their
time derivatives), see section 2.4.3. The actual path is that which cancels
the variational indicator with respect to all admissible variations of the
generalized coordinates, between two instants at which the conﬁguration
is ﬁxed.
For electromechanical systems, a variational indicator is now con-
structed as the sum of the mechanical indicator (1.26) and an electrical
indicator, either (2.24) or (2.31), depending on the formulation. The ac-
tual path is that which cancels the variational indicator with respect to
all admissible variations of the generalized coordinates, both mechanical
and electrical, compatible with the kinematics and compatible with the
electrical requirements (depending on the formulation). As before, the
system conﬁguration is ﬁxed at t1 and t2.
3.3.1 Displacement and charge formulation
In this case, the admissibility requirements include the kinematical con-
straints on the virtual displacements δxi and velocities, and Kirchhoﬀ’s

current rule on the virtual variations of charges δqi and currents. The
variational indicator is

The actual path is that which cancels the variational indicator (3.35) with
respect to all admissible variations δxi and δqi of the path between two
instants t1 and t2 at which δxi(t1) = δxi(t2) = δqi(t1) = δqi(t2) = 0. In
(3.35) the kinetic coenergy T ∗and the magnetic coenergy W ∗
m have been
grouped; they depend on the time derivative of the generalized coordi-
nates, respectively ˙xi and ik = ˙qk. On the contrary, the potential energy
V and the electrical energy We do not depend on the time derivative of
the generalized variables, but only on xi and qk. The Lagrangian is equal
to the total coenergy minus the total energy.
L = T ∗+ W ∗
m −V −We
(3.36)
3.3.2 Displacement and ﬂux linkage formulation
In this case, the admissibility requirements on the mechanical variables
are unchanged: the virtual displacements δxi must be compatible with the
kinematics. The admissible ﬂux linkage variations δλi must be compatible
with Kirchhoﬀ’s voltage rule. The variational indicator is
V.I. =

The actual path is that which cancels the variational indicator (3.37) with
respect to all admissible variations δxi and δλi of the path between t1 and
t2 at which δxi(t1) = δxi(t2) = δλi(t1) = δλi(t2) = 0. The Lagrangian is
now
L = T ∗+ W ∗
e −V −Wm
(3.38)
with the kinetic coenergy T ∗and the electrical coenergy W ∗
e depending on
the time derivative of the generalized coordinates, ˙xi and ˙λk = ek, while
the potential energy and the magnetic energy do not depend explicitly on
˙xi and ˙λk, but only on xi and λk.

3.4 Lagrange’s equations
If the system can be described by a complete set of independent coordi-
nates describing both the mechanical (zi) and the electrical part (qk or
λk) of the system, the admissibility conditions are automatically fulﬁlled
and the Lagrange equations can be derived from Hamilton’s principle as
we already did in section 2.5.
3.4.1 Displacement and charge formulation
Let zi be a complete set of m independent mechanical coordinates and qk
a complete set of n independent charge coordinates. The Lagrangian
L( ˙zi, zi, ˙qk, qk) = T ∗+ W ∗

coordinates. The Lagrangian

As in (1.51), it is customary to deﬁne the electrical dissipation function
in such a way that the contribution to the right hand side of the Lagrange
equation from the dissipative elements (the resistors) can be written re-
spectively
Ek = −∂D

3.5.1 Electromagnetic plunger
The electromagnetic plunger is used for tripping current breakers and
various types of relays and valves. A movable plunger is driven by an
electromagnet (Fig.3.7). The nominal gap of the plunger is x0, when the
current is zero (this corresponds to the unstretched position of the spring);
when the switch is closed, the current in the coil produces a magnetic force
which attracts the plunger down towards the electromagnet, to close the
magnetic circuit at x = −x0. The plunger is modelled as a spring-mass
system of mass m, stiﬀness k and viscous damping c. We also assume that
the electromagnet has a variable inductance
L(x) =
L0
1 + (x0 + x)/h
(3.53)
(h is deﬁned in Fig.3.7). In the charge formulation of the Lagrange equa-
tions, the generalized variables are respectively the displacement x of the
plunger measured from the nominal position, and the charge q correspond-
ing to the current loop shown in Fig 3.7. The Lagrangian reads

3.5.2 Electromagnetic loudspeaker
The loudspeaker converts electrical energy into acoustical energy; in an
electromagnetic loudspeaker, this is achieved with a voice coil actuating
a membrane which, in turn, displaces the surrounding air. The low fre-
quency behavior of the loudspeaker can be modelled as in Fig.3.8. The
mechanical part is represented by a spring-mass system (which, obviously
is appropriate only at low frequency); the mechanical constants m, k and
c are chosen to account for the ﬂuid-coupling eﬀect of the membrane. The
mechanical side is connected to the electrical side through a moving-coil
transducer which, as we have seen in section 3.2.3, is a perfect energy
transformer, with transducer constant T. The electrical side is modelled
by a voltage source in series with a RL circuit.
With the charge formulation of the Lagrange equations and the gener-
alized coordinates x and q (i = ˙q), the various energy contributors to the
Lagrangian are:

former, the set-up of Fig.3.8 could be used as a microphone as well, to
convert the acoustic pressure into an output voltage (the membrane would
be the pressure sensitive element). However, capacitive microphones are
more popular.

A condenser microphone consists of a movable plate mounted on a
circular spring parallel to a ﬁxed back plate. These two plates form a
variable capacitor charged by a constant voltage source through a RL
circuit. The voltage drop in the resistor R is supposed to give an electrical
image of the pressure (force) acting on the moving plate. The dynamics of
the moving plate is modelled by a spring-mass system of constants m, k, c,
Fig.3.9. At equilibrium, the electric charge q0 in the capacitor produces an
attractive force between the two plates, which is balanced by the extension
of the spring attached to the moving plate; let x0 be the distance between
the two plates and x1 be the spring extension at equilibrium. We analyze
the vibration about the equilibrium position, assuming that the moving
plate capacitance varies according to

3.5.4 Proof-mass actuator
A proof-mass actuator (Fig.3.10) is an inertial actuator which is used in
various applications of vibration control. A reaction mass m is connected
to the support structure by a spring k, a damper c and a force actuator f
which can be either magnetic or hydraulic. In the electromagnetic actuator
discussed here, the force actuator consists of a moving-coil transducer of
constant T excited by a current generator i; the spring is achieved with
membranes which also guide the linear motion of the moving mass. The
system is readily modelled as in Fig.3.10(a); in a charge formulation,
the system has a single generalized coordinate, x; q is not a generalized
variable because a current source is used, which enforces ˙q = i. The various

contributions to the Lagrangian are the same as for the electromagnetic

and the dissipation function is also identical

2R ˙q2
Note, however, that although the inductance L of the coil has been in-
cluded in W ∗
m and its resistance has been included in D, they will not
appear in the ﬁnal results, because q is no longer a generalized variable
[this is why they have been omitted in Fig.3.10(a)]. Since we use a current
source, we have also δWnc = 0. The Lagrange equation relative to the x
coordinate is readily obtained:
m¨x + c ˙x + kx = Ti
or, in the Laplace domain,
x =
Ti
ms2 + cs + k
(3.72)
(s is the Laplace variable). The total force applied to the support is equal
and opposite to that applied to the mass:
F = −ms2x =
−ms2Ti
ms2 + cs + k
It follows that the transfer function between the total force F and the
current i applied to the coil is
F
i =
s2T
s2 + 2ξpωps + ω2p
(3.73)
where T is the transducer constant (in Newton/Ampere), ωp = (k/m)1/2
is the natural frequency of the spring-mass system and ξp is the damping
ratio, which in practice is fairly high (the negative sign has been removed
because it is irrelevant). The Bode plots of (3.73) are shown in Fig.3.11;
one sees that the system behaves like a high-pass ﬁlter with a high fre-
quency asymptote equal to the transducer constant T; above some critical
frequency ωc ≃2ωp, the proof-mass actuator can be regarded as an ideal
force generator. It has no authority over the rigid body modes and the
operation at low frequency requires a large stroke, which is technically
diﬃcult. Medium to high frequency actuators (40 Hz and more) are rela-
tively easy to obtain with low cost components (loudspeaker technology).

Consider the system of Fig.3.12(a): two masses m1 and m2 are connected
by a spring k in parallel with a moving coil transducer of transduction
constant T (T = 2πnrB). This system constitutes a single axis electro-
dynamic isolator. The mass m1 is subjected to the disturbance force d,
and the mass m2 is that of the payload that must be isolated from the
disturbance. Note that no mechanical damper is involved in the isolator
(the damping turns out to be detrimental to the high frequency behavior
of the isolator).

Using once again the charge formulation of Lagrange’s equations and
the generalized coordinates x1, x2 and q, we can write the Lagrangian
L = T ∗+ W ∗
m −V −We
= 1
2m1 ˙x2
1+ 1
2m2 ˙x2
2+ 1
2L ˙q2+T ˙q(x2−x1−x0)−1
2k(x2−x1)2−q2
2C (3.74)
where x0 is an arbitrary reference state, see (3.33). The dissipation func-
tion is
D = 1
2R ˙q2
(3.75)
and
δWnc = d δx1 + E δq
(3.76)
Lagrange’s equations read
m1¨x1 + k(x1 −x2) + T ˙q = d
(3.77)
m2¨x2 + k(x2 −x1) −T ˙q = 0
(3.78)
L¨q + T( ˙x2 −˙x1) + R ˙q + q
C = E
(3.79)
The simplest situation is that where the moving coil transducer is shunted
on a resistor R; in this case, the electrical circuit consists of a single resistor
R and no voltage source is used. Equation (3.79) can be simpliﬁed to
T( ˙x2 −˙x1) + R ˙q = 0
(3.80)
which produces
T ˙q = −T 2( ˙x2 −˙x1)
R
(3.81)
substituting in (3.77) and (3.78), one ﬁnds
m1¨x1 + T 2
R ( ˙x1 −˙x2) + k(x1 −x2) = d
(3.82)
m2¨x2 + T 2
R ( ˙x2 −˙x1) + k(x2 −x1) = 0
(3.83)
In this case, the electrical system behaves like a viscous damper of con-
stant T 2/R.
If the moving coil transducer is connected to a current source [Fig.
3.12(b)], q is no longer a generalized variable, since ˙q = i; the Lagrangian
of the system is

86
L = 1
2m1 ˙x2
1 + 1
2m2 ˙x2
2 + Ti(x2 −x1 −x0) −1
2k(x2 −x1)2
(3.84)
and δWnc = d δx1. The Lagrange equations are in this case:
m1¨x1 + k(x1 −x2) + Ti = d
(3.85)
m2¨x2 + k(x2 −x1) −Ti = 0
(3.86)
These equations are the starting point for the analysis of an active sus-
pension.
3.5.6 The Sky-hook damper
Equation (3.83) deﬁnes a passive isolator where the damping is achieved
by dissipating the electrical energy produced by the moving coil trans-
ducer into a resistor R. The transmissibility of the isolator is deﬁned as
the transfer function between the displacement of the disturbance source,
x1, and that of the payload, x2. From (3.83), one ﬁnds easily
X2(s)
X1(s) =
T 2s/R + k
m2s2 + T 2s/R + k =
2ξωns + ω2
n
s2 + 2ξωns + ω2n
(3.87)
where ω2
n = k/m2 and T 2/Rm2 = 2ξωn. The transducer constant T and
the resistor R can be selected to smooth the resonance peak, but the
damping also spoils the high frequency behavior of the isolator, because
the asymptotic decay rate of the transmissibility (3.87) is ∼s−1, leading
to a high frequency attenuation of
20 dB/decade.
The sky-hook damper is a feedback strategy which allows one to elimi-
nate the resonance peak while preserving the asymptotic decay rate ∼s−2.
It is based on the system of Fig.3.12(b); an absolute acceleration sensor
is attached to m2 and is used to generate a feedback control force pro-
portional to the absolute velocity (an absolute velocity sensor can also be
used)
I = −g ˙x2
Combining with (3.86), one easily gets (in Laplace form)
m2s2x2 + k(x2 −x1) + Tgsx2 = 0
(3.88)
or
X2(s)
X1(s) =
k
m2s2 + Tgs + k =
ω2
n
s2 + 2ξωns + ω2n
(3.89)
where 2ξωn = Tg/m2 in this case. Compared with (3.87), this result indi-
cates that the feedback gain g can be adjusted to eliminate the resonance,
while the asymptotic decay rate is ∼s−2 (independent of g), correspond-
ing to a high frequency attenuation of
40 dB/decade.

Fig. 3.13. Servo geophone involving two moving-coil transducers.
A geophone is a transducer which behaves as an absolute velocity sen-
sor above some cut-oﬀfrequency depending on the mechanical structure
of the transducer. A servo geophone has the additional feature that an
internal feedback loop allows one to program the cut-oﬀfrequency of
the transducer for the targeted application. The system is represented in
Fig.3.13; it consists of a spring-mass system (m, k, c) connected to the sen-
sor frame and to two independent moving-coil transducers. One of them
(with transducer constant T1, on the left side in Fig.3.13) is connected
to a current source I(t) and is used in the internal feedback loop of the
system. The other one, of transduction constant T2 is used as sensor. The
inductance L represents that of the coil; the voltage drop in the resistor
is the output Vout of the geophone. Let x0 be the absolute displacement
of the frame (it is the input of the system) and x be that of the mass m.
Note that the loop current ˙q1 = i1 is subjected to the constraint ˙q1 = I of
the current source. Thus, in a charge formulation of Lagrange’s equations,
there are only two generalized variables, x and q2. The Lagrangian of the
system is

88
L = 1
2m ˙x2 + T1I(x −x0) −T2 ˙q2(x −x0) + 1
2L ˙q2
2 −1
2k(x −x0)2
(3.90)
and the dissipation function is
D = 1
2c( ˙x −˙x0)2 + 1
2R ˙q2
2
(3.91)
The contributions of the two moving coil transducers to the Lagrangian
have opposite signs because of the positive sign adopted for x (the ar-
bitrary reference position appearing in (3.33) has been set to zero).
Lagrange’s equations read
m¨x + c( ˙x −˙x0) + k(x −x0) −T1I + T2 ˙q2 = 0
(3.92)
L¨q2 −T2( ˙x −˙x0) + R ˙q2 = 0
(3.93)
Upon introducing the relative displacement y = x −x0, we can write these
equations
m¨y + c ˙y + ky −T1I + T2 ˙q2 = −m¨x0
(3.94)
L¨q2 + R ˙q2 −T2 ˙y = 0
(3.95)
Taking the Laplace transform of (3.95), one gets
Vout = Rs q2 =
RT2s
Ls + R y
(3.96)
and, if the resistance R is large (R→∞)
Vout ≃T2s y
(3.97)
From (3.94),
(ms2 + cs + k)y + T2sq2 = T1I −ms2x0
(3.98)

If R is large, the contribution of the moving coil transducer to the viscous
damping, T 2
2 /(Ls+ R), can be neglected (or combined with c), leading to
the approximation

(ms2 + cs + k)y = T1I −ms2x0
(3.100)
Combining with (3.97),
(ms2 + cs + k)Vout = T2T1sI −T2ms3x0
(3.101)
Next, if we include a proportional plus integral (PI) feedback controller
between Vout and the input current I:
I = −H(s)Vout = −(g1 + g2
s )Vout
(3.102)
where g1 and g2 are respectively the proportional and integral control
gains. From (3.102),
T2T1sI = −(T2T1g1s + T2T1g2)Vout
(3.103)
and, substituting into (3.101), one gets
h
ms2 + (c + T2T1g1)s + (k + T2T1g2)

Vout = −T2ms3x0
(3.104)
or
Vout
s x0
=
−T2ms2
ms2 + (c + T2T1g1)s + k + T2T1g2
(3.105)
Thus, the transfer function between the output voltage Vout and the ab-
solute frame velocity sx0 is a second order high-pass ﬁlter of asymptotic
gain T2, the transducer gain of the moving coil transducer on the right
hand side of Fig.3.13. Beyond some corner frequency, the system behaves
as an absolute velocity sensor. Without feedback control (g1 = g2 = 0),
the corner frequency of the sensor is ﬁxed by the mechanical resonance of
the sensor, (k/m)1/2, but if a PI controller is used, the corner frequency
and the damping ratio of the transfer function can be set arbitrarily by
selecting g1 and g2 in the appropriate manner. In particular, the mechan-
ical spring k can be softened with a negative value of g2. The transducer
gain T1 is also a design parameter.
3.5.8 One-axis

netic permittivity (like iron and air); it is orthogonal to the interface and
its magnitude

increases with the diﬀerence in permittivity between the two media.
The reluctance force has already been examined in the electromagnetic
plunger, in section 3.5.1; it is also central in magnetic suspensions where
it is used to levitate a body by balancing the gravity force and thus elimi-
nating friction. Consider the elementary one-axis model of Fig.3.14, where
the ideal current source reﬂects the fact that the magnetic suspensions
are usually controlled with current ampliﬁers.

(3.107)
This expresses the equilibrium between the inertia force, the gravity and
the reluctance attraction force (reluctance forces are always attractive).
The set point (x0, i0) is the static equilibrium point where the reluctance
force balances the gravity force

where ∆i is the current increment and ∆x is the displacement with respect
to the set point (i0, x0). The ﬁrst term is balanced by gravity and the
reluctance force increment reads
∆f = −L′(x0) i0∆i −i2
0
2 L′′(x0)∆x = ki∆i + kx∆x
(3.110)
where ki is the force to current factor and kx is the bearing stiﬀness about
the set point; they are illustrated in Fig.3.15. A negative stiﬀness kx means
that any disturbance load acting on the system will produce a deviation
from the set point which, in turn, will increase the imbalance and the
deviation from the set point. Such a system is mechanically unstable and
requires a feedback loop between the displacement increment ∆x and the
current increment ∆i to achieve stability.

3.6.1 Constitutive equations
The constitutive behavior of a wide class of electromechanical transduc-
ers can be modelled as in Fig.3.16, where the black box represents the

and vice versa. In Laplace form, the constitutive equations read

e = Zei + Temv

f = Tmei + Zmv
(3.112)
where e is the Laplace transform of the input voltage across the electri-
cal terminals, i the input current, f the force applied to the mechanical
terminals, and v the velocity of the mechanical part. Ze is the blocked
electrical impedance, measured for v = 0; Tem is the transduction co-
eﬃcient representing the electromotive force (voltage) appearing in the
electrical circuit per unit velocity in the mechanical part (in volt.sec/m).
Tme is the transduction coeﬃcient representing the force acting on the me-
chanical terminals to balance the electromagnetic force induced per unit
current input on the electrical side (in N/Amp), and Zm is the mechanical
impedance, measured when the electrical side is open (i = 0). As an ex-
ample, it is easy to check that the electromagnetic loudspeaker equations
(3.59) can be written in this form with Ze = Ls + R, Zm = ms + c + k/s,
Tem = T and Tme = −T. The same representation applies also to the
piezoelectric transducer analyzed in the next chapter.
In absence of external force (f = 0), v can be eliminated between the
two foregoing equations, leading to
e = (Ze −TemTme

−TemTme/Zm is called the motional impedance. The total driving point
electrical impedance is the sum of the blocked and the motional impedances.
3.6.2 Self-sensing
Equation (3.111) shows that the voltage drop across the electrical ter-
minals of any electromechanical transducer is the sum of a contribution
proportional to the current applied and a contribution proportional to
the velocity of the mechanical terminals. Thus, if Zei can be measured
and subtracted from e, a signal proportional to the velocity is obtained.
This suggests the bridge structure of Fig.3.17. The bridge equations are
as follows: for the branch containing the transducer,

impedance Zb must be adapted to the transducer impedance Ze to avoid
amplitude distortion and phase shift between the output voltage V4 −V2
and the transducer velocity in the frequency band of interest. The self-
sensing piezoelectric actuator will be examined in more detail in chapter

4.1 Introduction
Piezoelectric materials belong to the so-called smart materials, or multi-
functional materials, which have the ability to respond signiﬁcantly to
stimuli of diﬀerent physical natures. Figure 4.1 lists various eﬀects that
are observed in materials in response to various inputs: mechanical, elec-
trical, magnetic, thermal, light. The coupling between the physical ﬁelds
of diﬀerent types is expressed by the non-diagonal cells in the ﬁgure; if
its magnitude is suﬃcient, the coupling can be used to build discrete or
distributed transducers of various types, which can be used as sensors, ac-
tuators, or even integrated in structures with various degrees of tailoring
and complexity (e.g. as ﬁbers), to make them controllable or responsive
to their environment (e.g. for shape morphing, precision shape control,
damage detection, dynamic response alleviation,...).
Figure 4.2 summarizes the mechanical properties of a few smart mate-
rials which are considered for actuation in structural control applications.
Figure 4.2(a) shows the maximum (blocked) stress versus the maximum
(free) strain; the diagonal lines in the diagram indicate a constant energy
density. Figure 4.2(b) shows the speciﬁc energy density (i.e. energy density
by unit mass) versus the maximum frequency; the diagonal lines indicate a
constant speciﬁc power density. Note that all the material characteristics
vary by several orders of magnitude. Among them all, the piezoelectric
materials are undoubtedly the most mature and those with the most ap-
plications.
This chapter begins with the analysis of a one-dimensional discrete
piezoelectric transducer and the energy conversion process between me-
chanical energy and electrical energy. The constitutive equations are

amined, and the analytical forms of the electromechanical energy and co-
energy functions are established. Next, the integration of a piezoelectric
transducer into a mechanical system is considered, and the Lagrangian
formulation of the dynamic equations is addressed; it is then extended to
the case of a structure with a ﬁnite number of piezoelectric transducers.
The remainder of this chapter is devoted to the constitutive equations of a
general piezoelectric material and Hamilton’s principle for a piezoelectric
structure. Finally, the Lagrangian formulation is illustrated with Rosen’s
piezoelectric transformer.
4.2 Piezoelectric transducer
The piezoelectric eﬀect was discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie in
1880. The direct piezoelectric eﬀect consists in the ability of certain crys-
talline materials to generate an electrical charge in proportion to an exter-
nally applied force; the direct eﬀect is used in force transducers. According
to the inverse piezoelectric eﬀect, an electric ﬁeld parallel to the direction
of polarization induces an expansion of the material. The piezoelectric
eﬀect is anisotropic; it can be exhibited only by materials whose crystal
structure has no center of symmetry; this is the case for some ceramics

below a certain temperature called the Curie temperature; in this phase,
the crystal has built-in electric dipoles, but the dipoles are randomly ori-
entated and the net electric dipole on a macroscopic scale is zero. During
the poling process, when the crystal is cooled in the presence of a high
electric ﬁeld, the dipoles tend to align, leading to an electric dipole on
a macroscopic scale. After cooling and removing of the poling ﬁeld, the
dipoles cannot return to their original position; they remain aligned along
the poling direction and the material body becomes permanently piezo-
electric, with the ability to convert mechanical energy to electrical energy
and vice versa; this property will be lost if the temperature exceeds the
Curie temperature or if the transducer is subjected to an excessive electric
ﬁeld in the direction opposed to the poling ﬁeld.
The most popular piezoelectric materials are Lead-Zirconate-Titanate
(PZT) which is a ceramic, and Polyvinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) which is
a polymer. In addition to the piezoelectric eﬀect, piezoelectric materials
exhibit a pyroelectric eﬀect, according to which electric charges are gen-
erated when the material is subjected to temperature; this eﬀect is used
to produce heat detectors; it will not be discussed here.
In this section, we consider a transducer made of a one-dimensional
piezoelectric material of constitutive equations (we use the notations of
the IEEE Standard on Piezoelectricity)
D = εT E + d33T
(4.1)
S = d33E + sET
(4.2)
where D is the electric displacement (charge per unit area, expressed
in Coulomb/m2), E the electric ﬁeld (V/m), T the stress (N/m2) and
S the strain. εT is the dielectric constant (permittivity) under constant
stress, sE is the compliance when the electric ﬁeld is constant (inverse of
the Young’s modulus) and d33 is the piezoelectric constant, expressed in
m/V or Coulomb/Newton; the reason for the subscript 33 is that, by con-
vention, index 3 is always aligned to the poling direction of the material,
and we assume that the electric ﬁeld is parallel to the poling direction.
More complicated situations will be considered later. Note that the same
constant d33 appears in (4.1) and (4.2).
In the absence of external force, a transducer subjected to a voltage
with the same polarity as that during poling produces an elongation, and

a voltage opposed to that during poling makes it shrink (inverse piezo-
electric eﬀect). In (4.2), this amounts to a positive d33. Conversely (di-
rect piezoelectric eﬀect), if we consider a transducer with open electrodes
(D = 0), according to (4.1), E = −(d33/εT )T, which means that a trac-
tion stress will produce a voltage with polarity opposed to that during
poling, and a compressive stress will produce a voltage with the same
polarity as that during poling.

for short-circuited electrodes (in Coulomb/m2), and also that relating

sures the eﬃciency of the conversion of mechanical energy into electri-
cal energy, and vice versa, as discussed below. From (4.4), we note that

If one assumes that all the electrical and mechanical quantities are
uniformly distributed in a linear transducer formed by a stack of n disks of

Note that typical values of k are in the range 0.3−0.7; for large k, the
stiﬀness changes signiﬁcantly with the electrical boundary conditions, and
similarly the capacitance depends on the mechanical boundary conditions.

Fig. 4.4. Discrete Piezoelectric transducer.
Consider the discrete piezoelectric transducer of Fig.4.4; the total
power delivered to the transducer is the sum of the electric power, V i
and the mechanical power, f ˙∆. The net work on the transducer is
dW = V idt + f ˙∆dt = V dQ + fd∆
(4.10)
For a conservative element, this work is converted into stored energy, dWe,
and the total stored energy, We(∆, Q) can be obtained by integrating
(4.10) from the reference state to the state (∆, Q). Since the system is
conservative, the integration can be done along any path leading from
(0, 0) to (∆, Q). Upon diﬀerentiating We(∆, Q),
dWe(∆, Q) = ∂We

This is the analytical expression of the stored electromechanical energy
for the discrete piezoelectric transducer. Equations (4.12) recover the con-
stitutive equations (4.9). The ﬁrst term on the right hand side of (4.13) is
the electrical energy stored in the capacitance C(1 −k2) (corresponding
to a ﬁxed geometry, △= 0); the third term is the elastic strain energy
stored in a spring of stiﬀness Ka/(1 −k2) (corresponding to open elec-
trodes, Q = 0); the second term is the piezoelectric energy. Referring to
Fig.4.5, the last term in (4.13) corresponds to integrating (4.10) over the
horizontal segment from (0, 0) to (∆, 0), while the other two result from
integrating on the vertical segment, from (∆, 0) to (∆, Q).

recognized as the electrical coenergy in the capacitance C(1 −k2) (cor-
responding to a ﬁxed geometry, ∆= 0); the third is the strain energy
stored in a spring of stiﬀness Ka (corresponding to short-circuited elec-
trodes, V = 0). The second term of (4.17) is the piezoelectric coenergy;

cycle: ﬁrst, it is loaded with a force F with short-circuited electrodes; the
resulting extension is

energy stored in the system is

At this point, the electrodes are open and the transducer is unloaded ac-

boundary conditions,

leaving W1−W2 stored in the transducer. The ratio between the remaining
stored energy and the initial stored energy is
W1 −W2
W1
= k2
Similarly, consider the following electrical cycle: ﬁrst, a voltage V is
applied to the transducer which is mechanically unconstrained (f = 0).
The electric charges appearing on the electrodes are
Q1 = CV
where C = εT An2/l is the unconstrained capacitance, and the energy
stored in the transducer is

At this point, the transducer is blocked mechanically and electrically un-
loaded from V to 0. The electrical charges are removed according to

covered in this way is

Although the foregoing relationships provide a clear physical interpreta-
tion of the electromechanical coupling factor, they do not bring a practical
way of measuring k2; the experimental determination of k2 is often based
on impedance (or admittance) measurements, as discussed in the next
section.

Consider the linear structure of Fig.4.6, assumed undamped for sim-
plicity, and equipped with a discrete piezoelectric transducer as discussed
in the previous section. It is also assumed that the transducer is con-
nected to a current source I(t) and is shunted with a resistor R. Using
a ﬂux linkage formulation for the electrical quantities, the Lagrangian of
the system reads (Table 3.1):

where ˙λ = V is the voltage at the electrodes of the transducer. Combining
these equations and taking into account that ∆= bT x, where b is the
projection vector relating the end displacements of the transducer to the
global coordinate system, we can write the Lagrangian

where I is the current source intensity and F is the vector of external

alternatively by the dissipation function

In this case, it disappears from the virtual work equation. Similarly, if the
viscous damping of the structure is included in the analysis, an additional
contribution (1.53) appears in the dissipation function. These equations
are the starting point of the Lagrangian formulation of the system dy-
namics. The Lagrange equations relative to the generalized coordinates x

current source is used. We assume F = 0 in what follows.

4.4.1 Voltage source
If a voltage source is used instead of a current source, λ ceases to be
a generalized variable (see Table 3.1) and the shunted resistor becomes
irrelevant (and useless). In this case, Equ.(4.25) applies alone. In absence
of external forces, if one deﬁnes the unconstrained expansion δ = nd33V
under the voltage V [see Equ.(4.6)], it is rewritten
M ¨x + (K + KabbT )x = bKaδ
(4.27)
Thus, the eﬀect of the piezoelectric transducer on the structure can be
represented by a pair of self-equilibrating forces applied axially to the ends
of the transducer; as for thermal loads, their magnitude is equal to the
product of the stiﬀness of the transducer (under short-circuited boundary
conditions in this case, Ka) and the unconstrained piezoelectric expansion,
δ1. From (4.27), note that if the electrodes of the transducer are short-
circuited, δ = 0, and the eigenvalue problem is
M ¨x + (K + KabbT )x = 0
(4.28)
or alternatively in Laplace form
Ms2x + (K + KabbT )x = 0
(4.29)
Thus, K + KabbT is the global stiﬀness matrix when the transducer is
short-circuited.
4.4.2 Current source
If one considers the case of a pure current source, R →∞in (4.26). Upon
transforming in the Laplace domain and eliminating V between (4.26) and
(4.25), one ﬁnds easily after some algebra that the governing equation is.

Note that I/s is the electric charge Q, and, by setting f = 0 in Equ.(4.9),
one sees that δ = nd33Q/C is the free expansion of the transducer under
Q. Thus, as for a voltage source, the eﬀect of the piezoelectric transducer
on the structure can be represented by a pair of self-equilibrating piezo-
electric forces; the magnitude is equal to the product of the free expansion
δ and the stiﬀness of the transducer. Note, however, that the stiﬀness of
the transducer involved here is that with open electrodes, Ka/(1 −k2)

4.4.3 Admittance of the piezoelectric transducer
We have just seen that the eﬀect of the piezoelectric transducer on the
natural frequencies of the structure depends on its electrical boundary
conditions; the stiﬀness is larger with open electrodes than with short-
circuited electrodes, and the diﬀerence depends on the electromechanical
coupling factor. Consider the system of Fig.4.7(a), which is the simplest

4.4 Structure with a discrete piezoelectric transducer

possible dynamical model of the piezoelectric transducer; from (4.25) and
(4.26) (with b = 1), the governing equations are (in the Laplace domain):
(Ms2 + Ka)x = Kand33V
s[C(1 −k2)V + nd33Kax] = I
Upon substituting x from the ﬁrst to the second equation and using the
deﬁnition (4.8) of the electromechanical coupling factor, we obtain the
admittance (inverse of the impedance):

z is the natural frequency with open electrodes. Similarly, the denomina-
tor vanishes at the poles (±jp) such that

p is the natural frequency with short-circuited electrodes. This was ex-
pected since I = 0 with open electrodes and V = 0 with short-circuited
electrodes. This is a general statement; we will see later that when the
transducer is placed in a multiple d.o.f. structure, the poles and zeros in
the admittance FRF are solutions of the eigenvalue problems (4.29) and
(4.31), respectively. Combining (4.33) and (4.34), one ﬁnds that

stacked design is in compression); this can be represented a linear spring

properties of this transducer can be obtained from those of the original one

while the constant volume capacitance remains unchanged, C(1 −k2).

4.4.5 Active enhancement of the electromechanical coupling
The electromechanical coupling factor is a very important material prop-
erty, because it controls the conversion between the mechanical energy and
the electrical energy. The role of k2 in piezoelectric transformers and in
passive damping of vibration by shunted piezoelectric transducers on pas-
sive electrical networks will be stressed later in this book. In this section,
a way of increasing the electromechanical coupling factor by shunting a
(synthetic) negative capacitance on the transducer (Fig.4.9) is examined,
and the equivalent properties of the system are established.
Consider the system of Fig.4.9 where a piezoelectric transducer is in
parallel with a negative capacitance. The joint coenergy is the sum of that
of the piezoelectric transducer and that of the negative capacitance:
W ∗
e ( ˙λ) = 1
2C(1 −k2) ˙λ2 + nd33Ka ˙λ∆−1

The equivalent piezoelectric transducer is deﬁned as having the same n,
d33 and Ka (stiﬀness with short-circuited electrodes), and a capacitance
C∗and electromechanical coupling factor k∗such that the coenergy func-
tion can be written as in Equ.(4.17):

This implies that

one must have
k2 = n2d2

k∗2 = n2d2

ducer:
C∗= C −C1
(4.43)
k∗2 = k2
C
C −C1
(4.44)
Note that since k∗2 < 1, one must have C1 < C(1 −k2). Thus if a perfect
negative capacitance can be synthesized, the composite system formed by
a piezoelectric transducer in parallel with a negative capacitance behaves
like a equivalent piezoelectric transducer (Fig.4.9) with the reduced ca-
pacitance C∗given by (4.43) and the increased electromechanical coupling
factor k∗2 given by (4.44). In these circumstances, the negative capacitive
shunting can be seen as a way of improving the conversion properties of
the piezoelectric transducer. A negative capacitance can be synthesized
as indicated in Fig.4.10; it is an active circuit involving an operational
ampliﬁer.

The constitutive equations of a general piezoelectric material are
Tij = cE
ijklSkl −ekijEk
(4.62)
Di = eiklSkl + εS
ikEk
(4.63)
where Tij and Skl are the components of the stress and strain tensors,
respectively, cE
ijkl are the elastic constants under constant electric ﬁeld
(Hooke’s tensor), eikl the piezoelectric constants (in Coulomb/m2) and
εS
ij the dielectric constant under constant strain. These formulae use clas-
sical tensor notations, where all indices i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3, and there is a
summation on all repeated indices. The above equations are a general-
ization of (4.4), with Skl and Ej as independent variables; they can be
written alternatively with Tkl and Ej as independent variables:
Sij = sE
ijklTkl + dkijEk
(4.64)
Di = diklTkl + εT
ikEk
(4.65)
where sE
ijkl is the tensor of compliance under constant electric ﬁeld, dikl
the piezoelectric constants (in Coulomb/Newton) and εT
ik the dielectric
constant under constant stress. The diﬀerence between the properties un-
der constant stress and under constant strain has been stressed in section
4.3. As an alternative to the above tensor notations, it is customary to
use the engineering vector notations

Typical values of the piezoelectric constants for piezoceramics (PZT) and
piezopolymers (PVDF) are given Table 4.1. Examining the actuator equa-
tion (4.69), we note that when an electric ﬁeld E3 is applied parallel to
the direction of polarization, an extension is observed along the same
direction; its amplitude is governed by the piezoelectric coeﬃcient d33.
Similarly, a shrinkage is observed along the directions 1 and 2 perpendic-
ular to the electric ﬁeld, the amplitude of which is controlled by d31 and
d32, respectively (shrinkage, because d31 and d32 are negative). Piezoce-
ramics have an isotropic behaviour in the plane, d31 = d32; on the con-

118
trary, when PVDF is polarized under stress, its piezoelectric properties
are highly anisotropic, with d31 ∼5d32. Equation (4.69) also indicates that
an electric ﬁeld E1 normal to the direction of polarization 3 produces a
shear deformation S13, controlled by the piezoelectric constant d15 (simi-
larly, a shear deformation S23 occurs if an electric ﬁeld E2 is applied; it is
controlled by d24). An interesting feature of this type of actuation is that
d15 is the largest of all piezoelectric coeﬃcients (500 10−12C/N for PZT).
The various modes of operation associated with the piezoelectric coeﬃ-
cients d33, d31 and d15 are illustrated in Fig.4.12.

δλk of the path between t1 and t2, where δui(t1) = δui(t2) = δλk(t1) =

the variational indicator (4.79) is equivalent to enforcing Gauss’s equation
(4.93) and the dynamic equilibrium (4.94) within the volume of the mate-
rial, and the natural boundary conditions on the part of the surface where
external loads and electric charges are applied, (4.95) and (4.96). Hamil-
ton’s principle is the starting point for the ﬁnite element formulation of
piezoelectric structures.
4.9 Rosen’s piezoelectric transformer
Piezoelectric transformers were ﬁrst introduced by Rosen in 1956; they
have been very successful for low power applications such as power sup-
ply of laptop computers. Due to the high energy density of piezoelectric
materials, the high electromechanical coupling factors and the high qual-
ity factor of the mechanical resonance (low damping), they tend to be
lighter and more eﬃcient than wire wound transformers whose eﬃciency
tends to decrease rapidly as the size is reduced. Besides, they are free
from electromagnetic interference and the solid-state nature of piezoelec-
tric transformers is the key to mass production.
The principle of Rosen’s piezoelectric transformer is shown in Fig.4.13;
the left side is the driving section; the input a.c. voltage generates an axial
vibration thanks to the d31 coeﬃcient. The axial vibration is transmitted
to the power generating section which is polarized in the axial direction
and generates the output voltage thanks to the d33 coeﬃcient. The sys-
tem is supposed to work at an axial resonance of the free-free mechanical
system. We analyze this system as an application of Lagrange’s equation,
using the Rayleigh-Ritz method discussed in section 1.10. We assume that

axial displacements are close to those of a uniform bar (Fig.4.14)

(4.97)
The system has one generalized mechanical coordinate, the amplitude
z(t) of the assumed mode, and one generalized electrical coordinate, the
ﬂux linkage λ associated with the output voltage, ˙λ = Vout. Following the
general approach of Hamilton’s principle, we write the Lagrangian as the
sum of the kinetic coenergy T ∗and the coenergy function W ∗

respectively by (4.80) and (4.81)

where A is the cross-section and ̺ the mass density of the bar. Since the
electrical states of the driving section and the power generating section;
are diﬀerent, the coenergy function is partitioned:
(a) Driving section
The input voltage V is applied between electrodes which extend over the
entire length of the driving section; we therefore assume that the electric
ﬁeld E3 is uniform over the entire volume, E3 = V/t. From (4.81),

where the use of the subscript 3 in the properties reﬂects the fact that,

Gauss’s law states that div{D} = 0, that is
∂D1
∂x = 0
Thus D1 is constant along the power generating section. Integrating

Piezoelectric laminates
5.1 Piezoelectric beam actuator
Consider the piezoelectric beam of Fig.5.1; it is covered with a single
piezoelectric layer of uniform thickness hp, polarized along the z axis; the
supporting structure is acting as electrode on one side and there is an
electrode of variable width bp(x) on the other side. The voltage diﬀerence
between the electrodes is controlled, so that the part of the piezoelectric
material located between the electrodes is subjected to an electric ﬁeld
E3 parallel to the polarization (note that the piezoelectric material which
is not covered by the electrode on both sides is useless as active material).
We denote by w(x, t) the transverse displacements of the beam; according
to the Euler-Bernoulli assumption, the stress and strain ﬁelds are uniaxial,
along Ox; the axial strain S1 is related to the curvature w
′′ by
S1 = −zw
′′
(5.1)
where z is the distance to the neutral axis. We also assume that the piezo-
electric layer is thin enough, so that E3 is constant across the thickness.

Next, we can apply Hamilton’s principle, recalling that only the vertical
displacement is subject to virtual changes, δw, since the electric potential
is ﬁxed (voltage control). Integrating by part the kinetic energy with

(5.7)
This equation indicates that the eﬀect of the piezoelectric layer is equiva-
lent to a distributed load proportional to the second derivative of the width
of the electrode.
Examining the remaining terms, one must also have

The ﬁrst condition states that at an end where the rotation is free, one
must have
e31V bpzm + Dw
′′ = 0
(5.9)
This means that the eﬀect of the piezoelectric layer is that of a bending
moment proportional to the width of the electrode. Similarly, the second
condition states that at an end where the displacement is free, one must
have
e31V b

(5.10)
Since

means that the eﬀect of the piezoelectric layer is that of a point force
proportional to the ﬁrst derivative of the electrode width. One should al-
ways keep in mind that the piezoelectric loading consists of internal forces
which are always self-equilibrated.
Figure 5.2 shows a few examples of electrode shapes and the cor-
responding piezoelectric loading. A rectangular electrode [Fig.5.2(a)] is
equivalent to a pair of bending moments Mp applied at the ends of the
electrode. A triangular electrode [Fig.5.2(b)] is equivalent to a pair of
point forces P and a bending moment Mp; note that if the beam is
clamped on the left side, the corresponding loads will be taken by the

A parabolic electrode [Fig.5.2(c)] is equivalent to a uniform distributed

As another example, consider the electrode shape of Fig.5.3. It consists
of a rectangular part of length l1, followed by a part with constant slope,
of length l2. According to the foregoing discussion, this is equivalent to
bending moments M1 and M2 at the extremities of the electrodes, and

5.2 Laminar sensor
5.2.1 Current and charge ampliﬁers
When used in sensing mode, a piezoelectric transducer is coupled to
an operational ampliﬁer [Fig.5.4(a)] to form either a current ampliﬁer
[Fig.5.4(b)], or a charge ampliﬁer [Fig.5.4(c)]. An operational ampliﬁer is
an active electrical circuit working as a high gain linear voltage ampliﬁer
with inﬁnite input resistance (so that the input currents i−and i+ are
essentially zero), and zero output resistance, so that the output voltage e0
is essentially proportional to the voltage diﬀerence e+ −e−; the open loop
gain A is usually very high, which means that the allowable input voltage
is very small (millivolt). As a result, when the electrodes of a piezoelec-
tric transducer are connected to an operational ampliﬁer, they can be
regarded as short-circuited and the electric ﬁeld through the piezo can
be considered as E3 = 0. Then, it follows from the constitutive equation
(4.63) that the electric displacement is proportional to the strain
D3 = e31S1
(5.11)
5.2.2 Distributed sensor output
If one assumes that the piezoelectric sensor is thin with respect to
beam, the strain can be regarded as uniform over its thickness,

with a constant polarization proﬁle e31. It is assumed that the sensor
extends from x = a to x = b over the beam. Thus, the amount of elec-
tric charge is proportional to the weighted average of the curvature, the
weighing function being the width of the electrode. For an electrode with
constant width,
Q = −zme31bp[w
′(b) −w
′(a)]
(5.13)
The sensor output is proportional to the diﬀerence of slopes (i.e. rotations)
at the extremities of the sensor strip. We note that this result is dual of
that of Fig.5.2(a), where the piezoelectric transducer is used in actuation
mode.
Equation (5.12) can be integrated by parts, twice, leading to

If, as an example, one considers the case of a cantilever beam clamped at
x = 0 and covered with a piezoelectric strip and an electrode of triangular
shape extending over the whole length as in Fig.5.2.b (a = 0 and b = l),
w(0) = w
′(0) = 0 (cantilever beam) and b
′′
p = 0, bp(l) = 0, b

p = −bp(0)/l
(triangular electrode). Substituting into (5.14) and (5.12), one gets
Q = −zme31
bp(0)
l
w(l) ∼w(l)
(5.15)
Thus, the output signal is proportional to the tip displacement of the can-
tilever beam. Once again, this result is dual of that obtained in actuation
mode (the piezoelectric loading is a point force at the tip). Similarly, if
one considers a parabolic electrode as in Fig.5.2(c) and if the beam is
such that w(0) = w(l) = 0 (this includes pinned-pinned, pinned-clamped,
etc), we have bp(0) = bp(l) = 0 and b

p(x) = −8b/l2 and, substituting into
(5.14),
Q = zme31
8b

Z l

w(x)dx ∼

(5.16)
Thus, the output signal is proportional to the volume displacement, which
is, once again, dual of the uniform distributed load in actuation mode.
All the above results are based on the beam theory which is essentially
one-dimensional; their accuracy in practical applications will depend very
much on the relevance of these assumptions for the applications con-
cerned. This issue is important in applications, especially in collocated
control systems.
5.2.3 Charge ampliﬁer dynamics
According to Fig.5.4.c, the output voltage is proportional to the amount
of electric charge generated on the electrode; the ampliﬁer gain is ﬁxed
by the capacitance C. This relation is correct at frequencies beyond some
corner frequency depending on the ampliﬁer construction, but does not
apply statically (near ω = 0). If a reﬁned model of the charge ampliﬁer
is required, this behavior can be represented by adding a second order
high-pass ﬁlter
F(s) =
s2
s2 + 2ξcωcs + ω2c
(5.17)
with appropriate parameters ωc and ξc. For frequencies well above the
corner frequency ωc, F(s) behaves like a unit gain.

(5.18) into (5.7) (assuming p = 0), one gets

where the sums extend over all modes. Upon multiplying by φk(x), inte-

µk( ¨zk + ω2

Z l

′′
p(x)φk(x)dx
(5.22)
The right hand side is the modal force pk applied by the piezoelectric strip
to mode k. From the ﬁrst orthogonality condition (5.20), it is readily seen
that if the electrode proﬁle is chosen in such a way that

140

all the modal forces pk vanish, except pl:

(5.24)
such an electrode proﬁle will excite only mode l; it constitutes a modal
actuator (for mode l).
5.3.2 Modal sensor
Similarly, if the piezoelectric layer is used as a sensor, the electric charge
appearing on the sensor is given by (5.12). Introducing the modal expan-
sion (5.18),
Q = −zme31

i
zi(t)
Z l

i (x)dx
(5.25)
Comparing this equation with the second orthogonality conditions (5.21),
one sees that any speciﬁc mode can be made unobservable by choosing the
electrode proﬁle in such a way that the integral vanishes. If the electrode
proﬁle is chosen according to
bp(x) ∼Dφ
′′
l (x)
(5.26)
(proportional to the distribution of the bending moment of mode l), the
output charge becomes
Q ∼−zme31µlω2
l zl(t)
(5.27)
It contains only a contribution from mode l. This electrode proﬁle consti-
tutes a modal sensor. Note that, for a uniform beam, (5.19) implies that
the mode shapes satisfy φIV
i (x) ∼φi(x). It follows that the electrode
proﬁle of a modal sensor also satisﬁes that of a modal actuator: from
(5.26),
b
′′
p(x) ∼φIV
l

(5.28)
which satisﬁes (5.23). Figure 5.5 illustrates the electrode proﬁle of modal
ﬁlters used for a uniform beam with various boundary conditions; the

part of the sensor with negative polarity can be bonded on the opposite
side of the beam, with the same polarity. The reader will notice that the
electrode shape of the simply supported beam is the same as the mode
shape itself, while for the cantilever beam, the electrode shape is that of
the mode shape of a beam clamped at the opposite end.
Modal ﬁlters constitute an attractive option for spillover alleviation,
because they allow one to minimize the controllability and observability of
a known set of modes. The limits of the beam approximation in practical
applications will be discussed at the end of this chapter.
5.4 Active beam with collocated actuator-sensor
Consider a beam provided with a pair of rectangular piezoelectric actu-
ator and sensor (Fig.5.6). They are collocated in the sense of the Euler-
Bernoulli beam theory, which means that they extend over the same
length along the beam. The system can, for example, be modelled by
ﬁnite elements; the mesh is such that there is a node at both ends of the
piezos (each node has two degrees of freedom, one translation yi and one
rotation θi). We seek the open-loop FRF between the voltage V (t) applied
to the actuator, and the output voltage v0(t) of the sensor (assumed to
be connected to a charge ampliﬁer).

5.4.1 Frequency response function
According to the foregoing sections, the rectangular piezoelectric actuator
is equivalent to a pair of torques M with opposite signs and proportional
to V :
M = gaV
(5.29)
where ga is the actuator gain which can be computed from the actuator
size and the material properties (Fig 5.2). In the general form of the
equation of motion (1.50), the external force is
f = bM = bgaV
(5.30)
where the inﬂuence vector b has the form bT = (.., 0, −1, 0, 1, ...); the only
non-zero components correspond to the rotational degrees of freedom of
the nodes located at x = a and x = b in the model. In modal coordinates,
the system dynamics is governed by a set of independent second order
equations

kzk = φT

(5.31)
where ωk is the natural frequency of mode k, ξk the modal damping ratio
and µk the modal mass. Using the Laplace variable s, we can write it
alternatively as
zk =
pk
µk(s2 + 2ξkωks + ω2
k)
(5.32)
The modal forces pk represent the work of the external loading on the
various mode shapes:

(5.33)
where ∆θa

k b is the relative rotation (diﬀerence of slope) between the
extremities of the actuator, for mode k. Similarly, according to (5.13),
the sensor output is also proportional to the diﬀerence of slope, that
is the relative rotation of the extremities of the sensor, △θs. In modal
coordinates,
v0 = gs∆θs = gs

(5.34)
where gs is the sensor gain, depending on the sensor size, material proper-
ties and on the charge ampliﬁer gain, and ∆θs
i are the modal components
of the relative rotation between the extremities of the sensor. Note that
if the sensor and the actuator extend over the same length of the beam,
they can be considered as collocated in the sense of the Euler-Bernoulli
beam theory, and
∆θs
i = ∆θa

Combining the actuator equation (5.33), the sensor equation (5.34) with
the equation of structural dynamics in modal coordinates (5.32), one eas-
ily gets the FRF between the actuator voltage V and the sensor output
v0 by substituting s = jω.

All the residues of the modal expansion of the open loop FRF are positive

ing function of ω between resonances. Near the resonance ωi, G(ω) jumps
from +∞at ω−
i to −∞at ω+
i and its behavior must be similar to that of
Fig.5.7, with alternating poles (resonances) and zeros (anti-resonances)
on the imaginary axis, Fig.5.8(a). Actually, for a lightly damped system,
the poles and zeros are slightly in the left half plane [Fig.5.8(b)].

typical experimental results obtained with a system similar to that of
Fig.5.6. Observe that G(ω) does not exhibit any roll-oﬀ(decay) at high
frequency; this indicates a feedthrough component in the system, which
is not apparent from the modal expansion (5.36) (according to which the
high frequency behavior is as ω−2). We will come back to this shortly. 1
5.4.3 Modal truncation
Let us now examine the modal truncation of (5.36) which normally in-
cludes all the modes of the system (a ﬁnite number n with a discrete
model, or inﬁnite if one looks at the system as a distributed one). Obvi-
ously, if one wants an accurate model in some frequency band [0, ωc], all
the modes which belong to this frequency band must be included in the
truncated expansion, but the high frequency modes cannot be completely
ignored. Indeed, if one rewrites (5.36)

The feedthrough component observed in Fig.5.10 is clearly apparent in
(5.42) and (5.43). Note that the above equations require the static gain
G(0), but do not require the knowledge of the high frequency modes.
It is important to emphasize the fact that the quasi-static correction
has a signiﬁcant impact on the open-loop zeros of G(ω), and consequently
on the performance of the control system. Referring to Fig.5.7, it is clear
that neglecting the residual mode (quasi-static correction) amounts to
shifting the diagram G(ω) along the vertical axis; this operation alters
the location of the zeros which are at the crossing of G(ω) with the hori-
zontal axis. Including the quasi-static correction tends to bring the zeros
closer to the poles which, in general, tends to reduce the performance
of the control system. Thus, it is a fairly general statement to say that
neglecting the residual mode (high frequency dynamics) tends to overesti-
mate the performance of the control system. Finally, note that since the
piezoelectric loads are self-equilibrated, they would not aﬀect the rigid
body modes if there were any.
5.5 Piezoelectric laminate
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, the partial diﬀerential equation governing
the dynamics of a piezoelectric beam, and the equivalent piezoelectric
loads were established from Hamilton’s principle. A similar approach can
be used for piezoelectric laminates, but it is lengthy and cumbersome.
The analytical expression for the equivalent piezoelectric loads and the
sensor output can be obtained alternatively, as in the classical analysis
of laminate composites, by using the appropriate constitutive equations;
this is essentially the approach followed by (C.K. Lee, 1990).

5.5.1 Two dimensional constitutive equations
Consider a two dimensional piezoelectric laminate in a plane (x, y): the
poling direction z is normal to the laminate and the electric ﬁeld is also
applied along z. In the piezoelectric orthotropy axes, the constitutive

constants under constant electric ﬁeld, E3 is the component of the electric
ﬁeld along z, D3 is the z component of the electric displacement and ε
the dielectric constant under constant strain (εS).
5.5.2 Kirchhoﬀtheory
Following the Kirchhoﬀtheory (e.g. Agarwal and Broutman, 1990), we as-
sume that a line originally straight and normal to the midplane remains so
in the deformed state. This is equivalent to neglecting the shear deforma-
tions S23 and S31. If the midplane undergoes a displacement u0 , v0 , w0 ,
a point located on the same normal at a distance z from the midplane
undergoes the displacements (Fig.5.11)

are the curvatures (the third component represents twisting). The stresses
in the laminate vary from layer to layer (because of varying stiﬀness prop-
erties) and it is convenient to integrate over the thickness to obtain an
equivalent system of forces and moments acting on the cross sections:

relating the in-plane resultant forces to the midplane strains; D is the
bending stiﬀness matrix relating the moments to the curvatures, and B is
the coupling stiﬀness matrix, which introduces coupling between bending
and extension in a laminated plate; from (5.54), it is readily seen that
B vanishes if the laminate is symmetric, because two symmetric layers
contribute equally, but with opposite signs to the sum.
5.5.4 Multi-layer laminate with a piezoelectric layer
Next, consider a multi-layer laminate with a single piezoelectric layer
(Fig.5.14); the constitutive equations of the piezoelectric layer are (5.44)
and (5.45). Upon integrating over the thickness of the laminate as in the
previous section, assuming that the global axes coincide with orthotropy
axes of the piezoelectric layer, one gets

The right hand side are the equivalent piezoelectric loads. If the material is
isotropic, e31 = e32, and the equivalent piezoelectric loads are hydrostatic
(i.e. they are independent of the orientation of the facet within the part
covered by the electrode). Overall, they consist of an in-plane force normal
to the contour of the electrode, and a constant moment acting on the
contour of the electrode (Fig.5.15); the force per unit length and moment
per unit length are respectively

On the other hand, if the piezoelectric layer is used as a sensor and if
its electrodes are connected to a charge ampliﬁer which enforces V ∼0
(Fig.5.4), the sensor equation (5.56) becomes

This integral extends over the contour of the electrode (Fig.5.16); the

ment normal to the contour and the second one is associated with the
slope along the contour.
Once again, the duality between the equivalent piezoelectric loads gen-
erated by the transducer used as actuator, and the sensor output when
the transducer is connected to a charge ampliﬁer must be pointed out.
5.5.7 Remarks
1. In this chapter, we have analyzed successively the piezoelectric beam
according to the assumption of Euler-Bernoulli, and piezoelectric lami-
nate according to Kirchhoﬀ’s assumption. The corresponding piezoelectric
loads have been illustrated in Fig.5.2 and 5.15, respectively; the sensor
output, when the transducer is used in sensing mode, can be deduced
by duality: a bending moment normal to the contour in actuation mode
corresponds to the slope along the contour in sensing mode, and the in-
plane force normal to the contour in actuation mode corresponds to the
in-plane displacement normal to the contour in sensing mode. Figure 5.17
illustrates the equivalent piezoelectric loads according to both theories for
a rectangular isotropic piezoceramic patch acting on a structure extend-
ing along one dimension: according to the beam theory, the equivalent

Fig. 5.17. Equivalent piezoelectric loads of a rectangular piezoelectric patch bonded
on a beam: (a) beam theory, (b) laminate theory.
piezoelectric loads consist of a pair of torques applied to the end of the
electrode (Fig.5.17.a), while according to the laminate theory, the torque
is applied along the whole contour of the electrode and it is supplemented
by an in-plane force Np normal to the contour (Fig.5.17.b). If the struc-
ture extends dominantly along one axis, and if one is interested in the
structural response far away from the actuator (e.g. tip displacement),
it is reasonable to think that the piezoelectric loads of the beam theory
are indeed the dominant ones. However, in active vibration control, one
is often interested in conﬁgurations where the dual actuator and sensor
are close to being collocated, to warrant alternating poles and zeros in the
open-loop FRF, for a wide frequency range (the perfectly dual and collo-
cated case was considered in section 5.4); in this case, it turns out that the
contributions to the piezoelectric loading and to the sensor output which
are ignored in the beam theory are signiﬁcant, and neglecting them usu-
ally leads to signiﬁcant errors in the open-loop zeros of the control system.
This issue is discussed extensively in (Preumont, 2002).
2. Similarly, experiments conducted on a cantilever beam excited by
a PZT patch on one side and covered with an isotropic PVDF ﬁlm on
the other side, with an electrode shaped as a modal ﬁlter for the ﬁrst
mode according to the theory of modal sensor developed in section 5.3,
have revealed signiﬁcant discrepancies between the measured FRF and
that predicted by the beam theory; however, the FRF could be predicted
quite accurately by the laminated plate theory (Preumont et al., 2003).

3. The Kirchhoﬀtheory presented here mostly aimed at introducing
the equivalent piezoelectric loads (5.58) and the sensor output equations
(5.60) and (5.61). Mindlin shell ﬁnite elements have been considered in
(Piefort, 2001) and implemented in an industrial computer code (SAM-
CEF). A deeper discussion of the ﬁnite element formulation of multi-layer
piezoelectric shells can be found in (Benjeddou, 2000, Garcia Lage et al.,
2004, Heyliger et al ,1996) and the literature quoted in these papers. The
newly available PZT ﬁbers (with interdigitated electrodes or not), which
are usually supplied in a soft polymer cladding, seem to be particularly
diﬃcult to model accurately, due to the stiﬀness discrepancy between the
supporting structure, the PZT ﬁbers and the soft polymer interface; this
is the subject of on-going research.
4. For beams, modal ﬁltering has been achieved by shaping the width
of the electrode. This concept cannot be directly transposed to plates.
Spatial ﬁltering of two-dimensional structures requires the tailoring of the
piezoelectric constant, which is impossible in practice (the material can be
polarized or not, but the polarization cannot be controlled). This problem
has been solved by using a porous electrode; the fraction of electrode
area is adjusted to achieve homogenized piezoelectric constants which
produce the desired spatial ﬁltering; the theory and the design procedure
is described in (Preumont et al., 2003, 2005).

6.1 Introduction
Damping is essential in limiting the detrimental eﬀects of mechanical res-
onances. This is illustrated in Fig.6.1 which shows, for a single d.o.f. oscil-
lator, the inﬂuence of the fraction of critical damping ξ on (i) the dynamic
ampliﬁcation at resonance (expressed in dB) and (ii) the number of cycles
N necessary to reduce the amplitude of the impulse response by 50%.
Typical damping values encountered in various ﬁelds of structural engi-
neering are also indicated in Fig.6.1.
In this chapter, we consider a structure with one or several piezoelectric
transducers, and investigate how they can be used to introduce damping,
actively or passively. Active damping requires the introduction of a sensor
and a feedback control loop, which brings in all the classical control issues
such as stability, robustness, etc... In this analysis, we focus on collocated
actuator/sensor pairs, to beneﬁt from the alternating pole/zero pattern
of the open-loop transfer function. Indeed, thanks to this property, it
is possible to ﬁnd control laws with guaranteed stability, irrespective of
variations in the parameters of the structure. Passive damping can also be
achieved with a piezoelectric transducer, by ﬁrst transforming the energy
of the mechanical vibration into electrical energy, and then dissipating this
electrical energy in a passive electrical network. Good performance can be
achieved if one locates the transducer in order to maximize the mechanical
energy stored in it, and if one can maximize the energy conversion from
mechanical energy to electrical energy. The former depends essentially
on the structural design; the ability of a vibration mode to concentrate
the vibrational energy into the transducer is measured by the fraction of
modal strain energy, νi; the ability to transform the strain energy into

electrical energy is measured by the electromechanical coupling factor, k;
it is a material parameter; recent improvements in piezoelectric materials
have led to electromechanical coupling factors k33 of 0.7 and more, making
them a very attractive option for passive damping. νi and k are often
combined in the generalized electromechanical coupling factor, Ki.
In the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we consider the active damping of a
structure equipped with a discrete piezoelectric transducer and a collo-
cated force sensor; the feedback control law known as the Integral Force
Feedback (IFF) is shown to have guaranteed stability. The implementa-
tions based on voltage control and current control are compared, and the
modal damping ratio is estimated via a root locus technique; it is noted
that the performances of the voltage control implementation depend only
on the fraction of modal strain energy, while the current control imple-
mentation depends also on the electromechanical coupling factor. Next,
the passive control via resistive shunting is considered and it is shown that
the problem can be formulated with the same root-locus approach as the
IFF. Passive control via inductive shunting is also considered, where a

RL shunt is added to the capacitive piezoelectric transducer, to form a
resonant circuit acting as a vibration absorber; damping performances
are signiﬁcantly enhanced when the electrical circuit is properly tuned,
but they drop rapidly below the resistive shunting when the system is
de-tuned. The chapter ends with a brief discussion of the self-sensing
actuator, how it can be used for shaping transfer functions, and a few
alternative control strategies (Lead and PPF).

6.2 Active strut, open-loop FRF
Consider the system of Fig.6.2, formed by a linear structure equipped with
an active strut consisting of a piezoelectric transducer used as actuator
and a force sensor measuring the total force f in the strut. The actuator
is connected to a voltage source or a current source, while the force sensor
can be visualized as another piezoelectric transducer connected to a charge
ampliﬁer (Fig.6.3). According to the the constitutive equation (4.6), if
V = 0 is enforced at the electrodes of the sensor, Q = [nd33]sf. Following
Fig.5.4.c, the output voltage of the charge ampliﬁer is proportional to the
force f applied on the sensor:
y = −Q
C1
= −[nd33]sf
C1
= gsf
(6.1)
where [nd33]s refers to the sensor and C1 is the capacitance of the charge
ampliﬁer; gs is the sensor gain.

The system of Fig.6.2 has already been analyzed in Chapter 4; if the
transducer is controlled with a voltage source, the dynamics of the system
is governed by Equ.(4.27):
M ¨x + (K + KabbT )x = bKaδ
(6.2)
where δ = nd33V is the unconstrained expansion of the actuator under
voltage V . K is the stiﬀness matrix of the structure excluding the axial
stiﬀness of the actuator (but including the sensor), and b is the projection
vector of the actuator in the global coordinate system. The right hand
side of this equation are the piezoelectric loads. In Laplace variable, it
can be rewritten
x = (Ms2 + K + KabbT )−1bKaδ
(6.3)
(Ms2 +K +KabbT )−1 is the dynamic ﬂexibility matrix of the system. Let
φi be the normal modes, solutions of the eigenvalue problem
(K + KabbT −ω2
i M)φi = 0
(6.4)

(6.11)
On the other hand, according to the second constitutive equation (4.6) of
the actuator,
∆= bT x = nd33V + f/Ka = δ + f/Ka
(6.12)
(this equation states that the total displacement at the end nodes of
the actuator is the sum of the piezoelectric expansion and the elastic
displacement). Combining with the collocated sensor equation (6.1),
y = gsf = gsKa(bT x −δ)
(6.13)
Substituting (6.10), one ﬁnds the modal expansion of the open-loop trans-
fer function of the system

(6.15)
is readily interpreted as the ratio between (twice) the strain energy in the
actuator and (twice) the total strain energy when the structure vibrates

164
according to mode i; νi is the fraction of modal strain energy. With this
deﬁnition, the open-loop transfer function is rewritten
y
δ = gsKa[

i=1
νi
(s2/ω2

(6.16)
and, substituting s = jω, we obtain the open-loop FRF
y
δ = G(ω) = gsKa[
n
X
i=1
νi
(1 −ω2/ω2

(6.17)
where the sum extends to all structural modes of the structure. νi is
the residue of mode i in the modal expansion of the open-loop FRF; it
can be regarded as a compound index of controllability and observability
of mode i. νi is readily available from commercial ﬁnite element codes.
This result has been obtained by neglecting the structural damping; for
a lightly damped structure with modal damping ξi, it becomes
y
δ = gsKa[

X
i=1
νi
(1 + 2jξiω/ωi −ω2/ω2

(6.18)
Combining (6.17) with (6.12), one gets the FRF between the piezoelectric
free expansion δ and the total displacement of the actuator
∆
δ =

(6.19)
Considering the static response of the system, it is readily seen from (6.2)
that, at ω = 0,
∆= bT (K + KabbT )−1bKaδ
(6.20)
Thus, writing (6.19) for ω = 0, one gets
(∆

where K∗is the stiﬀness of the system (structure + short-circuited actu-
ator) seen from the end points of the transducer (Ka < K∗). This result
is helpful if one wants to truncate the modal expansion after m modes.
Using the same reasoning as in section 5.4.3, for ω ≪ωm, one can use the
approximation

Note that the modal truncation must be considered with care if one wants
to predict accurately the performance of the control system, and the dis-
cussion of section 5.4.3 applies fully here.
6.3 Active damping via IFF
6.3.1 Voltage control
Equation (6.2) governing the dynamics of the system is rewritten in
Laplace form
Ms2x + (K + KabbT )x = bKaδ
(6.26)
The output equation of the force sensor is given by (6.13):
y = f = gsKa(∆−δ) = gsKa(bT x −δ)
(6.27)
The Integral Force Feedback (IFF) consists of
δ =
g
gsKas y
(6.28)
(note that it is a positive feedback); 1/s is the integral eﬀect; the constant
gsKa at the denominator is for normalization purpose. Combining these
three equations, one easily gets the closed-loop characteristic equation

166
[Ms2 + (K + KabbT ) −s + g(KabbT )]x = 0
(6.29)
The asymptotic roots for g →0 (open-loop poles) satisfy
[Ms2 + (K + KabbT )]x = 0
(6.30)
The solutions of this eigenvalue problem are the natural frequencies ωi
of the global structure when the electrodes of the transducer are short-
circuited. On the other hand, the asymptotic roots for g →∞(open-loop
zeros, zi) are solutions of the eigenvalue problem
[Ms2 + K]x = 0
(6.31)
which corresponds to the situation where the axial contribution of the
transducer to the stiﬀness has been removed. Note that, depending on
the design of its connections with the structure, the transducer may con-
tribute to the stiﬀness matrix by more than its axial component KabbT ;
all but the axial component must be included in K to achieve an accu-
rate prediction of the zeros zi. In particular, the rotary stiﬀness of ﬂexible
joints approximating spherical joints in precision structures may some-
times have a signiﬁcant impact on the zeros.

6.3.2 Modal coordinates
The closed-loop equation is transformed to modal coordinates by the
change of variables x = Φα, where Φ = (. . . φi . . .) is the matrix of the
mode shapes; we assume that they have been normalized in such a way
that ΦT MΦ = I; the mode shapes are solutions of the eigenvalue problem
(6.30); the second orthogonality condition reads
ΦT (K + KabbT )Φ = ω2 = diag(ω2
i )
(6.32)
where ωi are the natural frequencies of the structure with short-circuited
electrodes. The modal expansion of the open-loop transfer function has
been obtained earlier in (6.17); the fact that all the residues νi in the open-
loop FRF are positive guarantees alternating poles and zeros, beginning
with a zero (Fig.6.4(a)). The root locus plot corresponding to the IFF is
shown in Fig.6.5.

Transforming (6.29) in modal coordinates, x = Φα, one gets
[Is2 + ω2 −
g
s + gΦT (KabbT )Φ]α = 0
(6.33)
(after using the orthogonality conditions). The matrix ΦT (KabbT )Φ is in
general fully populated; assuming that it is diagonally dominant, and
neglecting the oﬀ-diagonal terms, it can be rewritten
ΦT (KabbT )Φ ≃diag(νiω2
i )
(6.34)
after using the deﬁnition (6.15) of the fraction of modal strain energy, and
(6.33) is reduced to a set of uncoupled equations:

168
s2 + ω2
i −s + gνiω2
i = 0
(6.35)
Denoting
z2
i = ω2
i (1 −νi)
(6.36)
we can transform Equ.(6.35) into
1 + g
s2 + z2
i
s(s2 + ω2
i ) = 0
(6.37)
which shows that every mode follows a root locus with poles at ±jωi
and at s = 0, and zeros at ±jzi (Fig.6.6). From Equ.(6.31), we know
that the zeros are the natural frequencies of the structure when the axial
contribution of the transducer to the stiﬀness matrix has been removed.
The maximum modal damping is given by
ξmax

(6.38)
and it is achieved for g = ωi

ωi/zi. Comparing Fig.6.6 with Fig.6.5(b),
one sees that the approximation consisting of neglecting the oﬀ-diagonal
terms in (6.34) is essentially equivalent to assuming that the zeros are
given by (6.36), and that every single loop from ωi to zi in Fig.6.5(b)
can be drawn independently of the other neighboring loops. Note that,
since equation (6.36) relating the zeros zi, the poles ωi and the fraction

of modal strain energy νi is approximate, one can use the roots of (6.31)
as zi when drawing the root locus (6.37).1

(6.39)
In this equation, δ = nd33I/sC = nd33Q/C is the free extension of the
actuator under the electric charge Q. From the constitutive equation (4.9),
the sensor equation reads:
y = gsf = gs
Ka
1 −k2 (bT x −δ)
(6.40)
which is very much the same as (6.13), except that the stiﬀness is now
that for open electrodes. We use an IFF control on the charge Q, which
is equivalent to a proportional controller on I:
δ =
g
gs[Ka/(1 −k2)]s y
(6.41)
(again, the constant at the denominator is for normalization). Combining
these three equations as we already did in the previous section, one ﬁnds
easily that the closed-loop poles are solutions of the eigenvalue problem

(6.43)
The solutions are the natural frequencies of the global structure, Ωi, when
the transducer electrodes are open. On the other hand, the asymptotic

slightly to the left along the real axis; this may help to prevent saturation due to
integral control; it is not critical if a piezoelectric force sensor is used, because the

170
roots when g →∞(open-loop zeros, zi) are again solutions of the eigen-
value problem (6.31). Following the same procedure as in the previous
section, we can transform Equ.(6.42) into modal coordinates; it is readily
found that the closed-loop poles are solutions of

s(s2 + Ω2

(6.44)
which is the same as (6.37), except that the natural frequencies Ωi with
open electrodes are used instead of ωi (with short-circuited electrodes).
The root locus is again that of Fig.6.6, and the maximum damping ratio
is given by (6.38) with Ωi instead of ωi:

6.4 Admittance of the piezoelectric transducer
The admittance of the transducer alone has already been investigated in
section 4.4.3, to establish the relationship between the electromechanical
coupling factor and the natural frequencies with open and short-circuited
boundary conditions. Here, we consider a more complex situation where
the transducer is mounted in a structure (that we assume undamped, as
usual, to simplify the equations as much as we can). The dynamics of this
system was already examined in section 4.4; with R →∞and F = 0 in
(4.25) and (4.26),
(Ms2 + K + KabbT )x = bKand33V
(6.48)
I = sC(1 −k2)V + snd33KabT x
(6.49)
The ﬁrst equation governs the dynamics of the structure, and the second
is the constitutive equation of the piezoelectric transducer. From (6.48)

(6.54)
It is represented in Fig.6.4(b). This ﬁgure can in fact be obtained by
translating the diagram of Fig.6.4(a) along the vertical axis. Again, the
diagram exhibits alternating poles and zeros (all the residues are positive),
but in reverse order (it begins with a pole at ω1). The poles are the same
as those of the open-loop FRF, that is the natural frequencies of the
structure with short-circuited electrodes. Let us consider the zeros: they
are solution of (6.49) with I = 0
0 = sC(1 −k2)V + snd33KabT x
(6.55)
Substituting V from this equation into (6.48) and using the deﬁnition
(4.8) of the electromechanical coupling factor, one ﬁnds that the zeros are
solutions of
(Ms2 + K +
Ka
1 −k2 bbT )x = 0
(6.56)
This equation is identical to (6.43), meaning that the zeros of the ad-
mittance are the poles of the system when the transducer electrodes are
open, Ωi. Thus, in a single admittance (or impedance) measurement, the
natural frequencies ωi with short-circuited electrodes and Ωi with open
electrodes can be determined.

6.5 Damping via resistive shunting
Return to Equ.(4.25)(4.26) and set F = 0 and I = 0 (the current source
is removed); the governing equations are, in the Laplace domain
(Ms2 + K + KabbT )x = bKand33V
(6.57)
[sRC(1 −k2) + 1]V = −sRnd33KabT x
(6.58)
Eliminating V and using the deﬁnition of k2, one gets the characteristic
equation
[Ms2 + (K + KabbT ) +
k2KabbT
(1 −k2) + 1/sRC ]x = 0
(6.59)
When R = 0, it is identical to (6.30), leading to the frequencies ωi (short-
circuited). For R →∞, it becomes identical to (6.43), leading to Ωi (open
electrodes). Upon transforming into modal coordinates, exactly as we did
in the previous sections, and denoting ̺ = RC, one ﬁnds that every mode
follows the characteristic equation

Thus, although resistive shunting is by no means a feedback control, the

root locus has once again the shape of Fig.6.6, with open-loop poles at

This equation points out the inﬂuence of the fraction of modal strain
energy νi and the electromechanical coupling factor k on passive damp-
ing with resistive shunting. Note that all the modes cannot be optimally
damped simultaneously, because there is a single tuning parameter ̺.
Figure 6.7 and Table 6.1 summarize the results of the three control
conﬁgurations. Column 4 of Table 6.1 gives an approximation of the max-
imum achievable modal damping based on (6.62); these expressions show
clearly the inﬂuence of the fraction of modal strain energy νi and that of
the electromechanical coupling factor k. Figure 6.8 shows a chart of the
maximum achievable modal damping for the three control strategies, as a
function of νi and k; the contour lines correspond to constant modal damp-
ing. Note that: (i) For the IFF with voltage control, the maximum damp-
ing is independent of the electromechanical coupling factor. (ii) The IFF
with charge control gives always better performances than with voltage
control; the advantage increases with k. (iii) Signiﬁcant modal damping
with resistive shunting can be achieved only when the electromechanical
coupling factor is large; piezoelectric materials with k ≥0.7 are available.

6.5.1 Damping enhancement via negative capacitance shunting
Equation (6.63) indicates that the damping performance of the resistive
shunting depends critically of the electromechanical coupling factor and
Fig.6.8(c) shows that when k is larger than 0.7, signiﬁcant damping (say
> 0.05) can be achieved for reasonable values of νi. On the other hand,
the active enhancement of the electromechanical coupling factor via a
synthetic negative capacitance has been addressed in section 4.4.5; If the
piezoelectric transducer is shunted on a negative capacitance −C1 [such
that C1 < C(1 −k2)], it behaves like an equivalent transducer with prop-
erties given by (4.43) and (4.44):
C∗= C −C1
k∗2 = k2
C
C −C1
Thus, the damping eﬀectiveness of the resistive shunting can be improved
by placing a negative capacitance in parallel with the transducer. The
performances can again be predicted by the root locus (6.61) where k∗
is used in (6.47) to evaluate Ω2
i . The maximum damping is still given by

176
(6.63) with k∗instead of k. The idea of using a negative synthetic capac-
itance to enhance the damping seems to have been originally proposed
by (Forward, 1979); some stability problems remain and this topic is still
under investigation.
6.5.2 Generalized electromechanical coupling factor
The admittance function of a piezoelectric transducer mounted in a struc-
ture exhibits alternating poles at ωi and zeros at Ωi [Fig.6.4(b)]. By
analogy with (4.35), the generalized electromechanical coupling factor (of
mode i) is deﬁned as
K2
i = Ω2
i −ω2
i
Ω2
i
(6.64)
Using (6.47), one ﬁnds
K2
i =
k2νi
1 −k2 + k2νi
(6.65)
K2
i combines material data with information about the structure; K2
i = k2
if νi = 1. Note that, in the literature, the deﬁnition
K2
i = Ω2
i −ω2
i
ω2
i
=
k2νi
1 −k2
(6.66)
is often used instead of (6.64). The diﬀerence between the two deﬁnitions
is insigniﬁcant in most practical applications, but (6.66) does not supply
Ki = k if νi = 1. Note also that the maximum performance of resistive
shunting, (6.63), is directly related to the generalized electromechanical
coupling factor.
6.6 Inductive shunting
Inductive shunting constitutes an alternative way of enhancing the modal
damping; the shunt consists of an inductor and a resistor in series which
are combined with the capacitance of the piezoelectric transducer to create
a damped electrical resonance; if the electrical resonance is tuned on the
mechanical resonance, the resonant shunt acts as a vibration absorber as
in Den Hartog’s tuned mass damper. The theory of inductive shunting
was ﬁrst developed by (Hagood & von Flotow, 1991).

(6.73)

is the admittance of the shunt. Substituting λ into the ﬁrst equation, one
ﬁnds the eigenvalue problem

in the previous sections, one ﬁnds that every mode is governed by the

be rearranged into

1 + 2ξeωe
s(s2 + Ω2
i )
s4 + (Ω2
i + ω2e)s2 + ω2
i ω2e

(6.83)
In this formulation, 2ξeωe plays the role of the gain in a classical root
locus. Note that, for large R, the poles tend to ±jΩi, as expected. For
R = 0 (i.e. ξe = 0), they are the solutions p1 and p2 of the characteristic
equation s4 + (Ω2
i + ω2
e)s2 + ω2
i ω2
e = 0 which accounts for the classical
double peak of resonant dampers, with p1 above jΩi and p2 below jΩi.
Figure 6.10 shows the root locus for a ﬁxed value of ωi/Ωi and various
values of the electrical tuning, expressed by the ratio
αe = ωeωi
Ω2
i
(6.84)
The locus consists of two loops, starting respectively from p1 and p2; one
of them goes to jΩi and the other goes to the real axis, near −Ωi. If
αe > 1 [Fig.6.10(a)], the upper loop starting from p1 goes to the real axis,
and that starting from p2 goes to jΩi, and the upper pole is always more
heavily damped than the lower one (note that, if ωe →∞, p1 →∞and
p2 →jωi; the lower branch of the root locus becomes that of the resistive
shunting). The opposite situation occurs if αe < 1 [Fig.6.10(b)]: the upper
loop goes from p1 to jΩi and the lower one goes from p2 to the real axis;
the lower pole is always more heavily damped. If αe = 1 [Fig.6.10(c)], the
two poles are always equally damped until the two branches touch each
other in Q. This double root is achieved for
αe = ωeωi
Ω2
i
= 1, ξ2
e = 1 −ω2
i
Ω2

(6.85)
This can be regarded as the optimum tuning of the inductive shunting
(note that, comparing with (6.64), ξ2
e = K2
i ; thus, the optimum electrical
damping ratio exactly matches the generalized electromechanical coupling
factor). The corresponding eigenvalues satisfy
s2 + Ω2
i + Ωi(Ω2

−1)1/2s = 0
(6.86)
For various values of ωi/Ωi (or Ki), the optimum poles at Q move along
a circle of radius Ωi [Fig.6.10(d)]. The corresponding damping ratio can
be obtained easily by identifying the previous equation with the classical
form of the damped oscillator, s2 + 2ξiΩis + Ω2
i = 0, leading to

180
Fig. 6.10. Root locus plot for inductive shunting (only the upper half is shown). The

(6.88)
This value is signiﬁcantly higher than that achieved with purely resistive
shunting [it is exactly the square-root of (6.63)]; it has been added to
Table 6.1 for comparison. Note, however, that it is much more sensitive
to the tuning of the electrical parameters on the targeted modes. This is

ξi when the actual natural frequency ω′
i moves away from the nominal
frequency ωi for which the shunt has been optimized (the damping ratio
associated with p1 and p2 is plotted in dotted lines; the ratio ω′
i/Ω′
i is
kept constant in all cases). One sees that the performance of the induc-
tive shunting drops rapidly below that of the resistive shunting when the
de-tuning increases. Note that, for low frequency modes, the optimum in-
ductance value can be very large; such large inductors can be synthesized
electronically. The multimodal passive damping via resonant shunt has
been investigated by (Hollkamp, 1994).
All the dissipation mechanisms considered in this chapter are based
on linear time-invariant ﬁlters. Recently, promising alternative nonlinear
methods based on state switching have been proposed. The transducer is
connected to a solid-state switch device which discharges periodically the
piezoelectric element on a small inductor, producing a voltage inversion
(Guyomar & Richard, 2005).
6.6.1 Alternative formulation
Throughout our analysis of piezoelectric structures, we have adopted a
ﬂux linkage formulation for the electrical variables. However, we could
also have used a charge formulation. In most cases, this would have led to

182
more electrical variables, but in the particular case of inductive shunting,
the charge formulation is in fact more compact, because there is a single
electrical variable instead of two in the ﬂux linkage formulation. Let ˙q be
the current in the single current loop of Fig.6.9; the Lagrangian of the
system is in this case 2
L = T ∗+ W ∗
m −V −We
(6.89)
where T ∗and V refer, as usual, to the mechanical part of the system, W ∗
m
is the magnetic coenergy of the inductor, W ∗
m = (1/2)L ˙q2, and We is the
electromechanical energy of the piezoelectric transducer, given by (4.13).

6 Active and passive damping with piezoelectric transducers

6.7 Decentralized control
183
6.7 Decentralized control
One way to increase the damping is to use multiple transducer systems
controlled in a decentralized manner (Fig.4.11); this allows one to preserve
the robustness properties of individual loops with respect to the paramet-
ric uncertainty, and minimizes the sensitivity with respect to sensor and
actuator failure by leaving the remaining loops unaﬀected if one of them
breaks. The dynamics of a structure with nT identical piezoelectric trans-
ducers has been analyzed in section 4.5; the governing equations are (4.49)
and (4.50).
We ﬁrst consider the case where the transducers, assumed to be identi-
cal, are connected to voltage sources, and the IFF controller relies on inde-
pendent force feedback loops with identical gains. With voltage sources, λ
are no longer generalized variables, and the system dynamics is governed
by
Ms2x + (K + KaBBT )x = BKaδ = KaBnd33V
(6.95)
where V is the vector of voltages applied and B is the (n×nT ) projection
matrix relating the end displacements of the transducers to the global
coordinate system, ∆= BT x, and δ is the vector of unconstrained piezo-
electric displacements. As in the single-input single-output (SISO) case
discussed earlier, the output equation of the force sensor is
y = f = gsKa(∆−δ) = gsKa(BT x −δ)
(6.96)
and the IFF control law is
δ =
g
gsKas y
(6.97)
These equations are formally identical to those of the SISO case, except
that δ and y are vector quantities; it is assumed that the control gain g is
the same for all control loops. Combining the above equations, we obtain
the closed-loop characteristic equation
[Ms2 + (K + KaBBT ) −
g
s + g(KaBBT )]x = 0
(6.98)
As in the SISO case, the asymptotic roots for g →0 (open-loop poles),
solution of
[Ms2 + (K + KaBBT )]x = 0
(6.99)
are the natural frequencies ωi of the global structure with short-circuited
electrodes. On the other hand, the asymptotic roots for g →∞(open-loop
zeros, zi) are solutions of

184
[Ms2 + K]x = 0
(6.100)
which, again, corresponds to the situation where the axial contribution of
the transducer to the global stiﬀness matrix has been removed. A notable
diﬀerence with respect to the SISO case, however, is the fact that the poles
and zeros are no longer guaranteed to be alternating along the imaginary
axis, and it is not always simple to determine the asymptotic value of
a speciﬁc mode without following the entire locus. The formulation into
modal coordinates follows exactly section 6.3.2, except that the fraction
of modal strain energy is deﬁned by
ΦT (KaBBT )Φ ≃diag(νiω2
i )
(6.101)
and contains contributions from all transducers. The results of Table 6.1
still apply in this case, with νi being the fraction of modal strain energy
for all the transducers.3
The case of the current sources and the resistive shunting can be
treated similarly; again, if one assumes that all shunting loops use the
same resistor, all the results of Table 6.1 apply. The actuator placement
aims at maximizing the fraction of modal strain energy in the set of modes
that are targeted for control. An interesting option consists of integrat-
ing piezoelectric transducers into a Stewart-Gough platform, which can be
used as an interface between independent substructures; this application
is discussed in (Preumont, 2002, Abu Hanieh, 2003). Another applica-
tion is the control of large trusses with cables attached to active tendons;
it has been explored in (Preumont, Achkire, Bossens, 1997-2001); once
again, the cable network is designed to maximize the fraction of modal
strain energy in the active tendons.
6.8 General piezoelectric structure
The dynamics of a general piezoelectric structure has been analyzed in
section 4.6. The governing equations are
Ms2x + Kxxx −KT
φxV = 0
(6.102)
sCφφV + sKφxx + YSHV = I
(6.103)
For passive shunting, I = 0 and V can be eliminated from the previous
equations, leading to the eigenvalue problem
3 within the limits of the approximation (6.101).

6.9 Self-sensing
185
[Ms2 + Kxx + sKT
φx(sCφφ + YSH)−1Kφx]x = 0
(6.104)
There are numerous practical situations where Cφφ and YSH are diago-
nal matrices [e.g. a structure with a set of PZT or MFC (Macro Fiber
Composite) patches shunted independently] and the foregoing equation
can be reduced to a form essentially similar to (6.59). The two asymp-
totes for YSH →∞and YSH = 0 are again the eigenvalue problems with
short-circuited electrodes and open electrodes, respectively.
6.9 Self-sensing
The active strut of Fig.6.3 consists of two transducers, one used as ac-
tuator, and one as force sensor. It is possible to combine the sensor and
the actuator into a single element called a self-sensing actuator (Dosch,
Inman & Garcia, 1992). The general principle of self-sensing has already
been discussed at the end of Chapter 3; here the special case of a piezo-
electric transducer is considered. Since the impedance of a piezoelectric
transducer is essentially that of a capacitor, the bridge structure is that
of Fig.6.12, with all elements being capacitors (C2 and C3). The control
voltage is Vc and the sensor output is V1 −V2. By an appropriate choice
of the capacitance C3, one can make the sensor output proportional to
the force f applied to the transducer, or to the strain, that is the relative
displacement ∆of its end points. Moreover, we will see that the trans-
mission zeros depend on the capacitance C3 which can therefore be used
for shaping the open-loop transfer function.

6.9.1 Force sensing
The self-sensing actuator consists of a bridge (Fig.6.12); one element of the
right branch of the bridge is the transducer itself, while the other branch
is made of known capacitors. According to the constitutive equation of
the transducer, (4.6),
I/s = Q = CV + nd33f
(6.105)
where C is the unconstrained capacitance (f = 0) and V = Vc −V1 is the
voltage diﬀerence at the transducer electrodes. It follows that
V = I

(6.106)
On the other hand, V1 = I/C2s and

(6.110)
is proportional to the force applied to the transducer.

Alternatively, let us start from the constitutive equation (4.7)
I/s = Q = CSV + nd33Ka∆

the output voltage

∆
(6.114)
is proportional to the relative displacement ∆at the end nodes of the
transducer.
6.9.3 Transfer function
We have just seen that the output of the self-sensing actuator depends of
the value of the capacitance C3 in the measurement bridge; C3 = C, the
unconstrained capacitance of the transducer, leads to an output signal
proportional to the force acting on the transducer, and C3 = CS = C(1−
k2), the blocked capacitance, leads to an output signal proportional to the
relative displacement of the end nodes of the transducer. This suggests

that the transmission zeros depend on the value of the capacitance C3.
This point is investigated in this section.
Consider the self-sensing actuator inserted in a structure as in Fig.6.13;
the capacitance C3 can be varied and its inﬂuence on the open-loop zeros
of the transfer function (V1 −V2)/Vc is investigated. The Lagrangian of
the system reads in this case

There are two electrical variables, λ1 and λ2; proceeding as in section 4.4,
the Lagrange’s equations read (in Laplace form)
Ms2x + (K + KabbT )x = bKand33(Vc −V1)
(6.116)
s[−C(1 −k2)(Vc −V1) −nd33KabT x + C2V1] = 0
(6.117)
s[−C3(Vc −V2) + C2V2] = 0
(6.118)
after substituting V1 = ˙λ1 and V2 = ˙λ2. The ﬁrst equation governs the
dynamics of the structure, while the other two express the KCR in the
two branches of the bridge. The third equation immediately provides

The transfer function between Vc and V1 can be obtained as follows; from
(6.117)
V1 = nd33KabT x + C(1 −k2)Vc
C(1 −k2) + C2
(6.120)
Introducing in (6.116), one gets easily
{Ms2 + K + KabbT [1 +

1 −k2 + r]Vc (6.121)
where we have used (4.8) and deﬁned r = C2/C. This equation is very
similar to (4.30). Upon transforming into modal coordinates as in section
6.3.2, x = Φα, one ﬁnds easily the modal equation

This equation shows that the open-loop poles lie somewhere between those
of the system with short circuited electrodes, ωi (corresponding to r →∞)
and those of the system with open electrodes, Ωi (corresponding to r = 0).
To make this equation more compact, let us deﬁne

One sees that all the residues of the modal expansion are positive; this
guarantees alternating poles and zeros in the transfer function. On the
other hand, the feedthrough component (between brackets) has a mag-
nitude which is controlled by the ratio C/C3; by making C3 a variable
element, it is possible to change the magnitude of the feedtrough and
consequently the location of the zeros. This brings a degree of tailoring
on the open-loop transfer function. To illustrate this, consider the asymp-
totic situation where r ≫1; in this case, the previous equation can be
simpliﬁed into
G(s) = V1 −V2
Vc

term is positive and smaller than k2. It follows that C3 = C leads to

to G(0) > 0. Thus, if C3 = C, G(s) exhibits alternating poles and zeros
on the imaginary axis, starting with a zero, while if C3 = C(1 −k2), it
starts with a pole. This is illustrated in Fig.6.14 which shows the eﬀect
of C3 on a typical open-loop FRF (this ﬁgure has been generated with
the following data: ω1 = 1, ω2 = 2, ω3 = 3, ν1 = ν2 = ν3 = 0.2, k = 0.5,
r = 1, and a uniform damping ξi = 0.01).
6.10 Other active damping strategies
In Fig.6.14, all the FRF exhibit alternating poles and zeros; however,
they diﬀer in the way the pole-zero pattern starts at low frequency. The
FRF corresponding to C3 = C starts with a low frequency zero and is
identical to that of Fig.6.4(a) or Fig.6.5(b); the IFF is a very eﬀective
control strategy for this situation. On the other hand, for C3 = C(1−k2),
the FRF starts with a low frequency pole, and the IFF strategy would be
unstable for this pole-zero conﬁguration; alternative strategies applicable
in this case are discussed below.
6.10.1 Lead control
The ﬁrst case to consider is that where the open-loop FRF exhibits some
roll-oﬀat high frequency, usually
40 dB/decade, corresponding to the
open-loop transfer function having two poles in excess of zeros (decays as
ω−2 at high frequency). The modal expansion of the open-loop transfer
function is
G(s) =
n
X
i=1
bT φiφT
i b
µi(s2 + ωi2)
(6.128)
This corresponds typically to the case of a point force actuator collocated
with a displacement sensor. The pole-zero pattern is that of Fig.6.15; this
system can be damped with a lead compensator:
H(s) = gs + z
s + p
(p ≫z)
(6.129)
The block diagram of the control system is shown in Fig.6.16. This con-
troller takes its name from the fact that it produces a phase lead in the
frequency band between z and p, bringing active damping to all the modes
belonging to z < ωi < p. All the branches of the root locus belong to the
left-half plane, which means that the closed-loop system has guaranteed
stability, at least if perfect actuator and sensor dynamics are assumed.

6.10.2 Positive Position Feedback (PPF)
The situation where the open-loop FRF has a roll-oﬀof -40 dB/decade is
not the most frequent one when piezoelectric actuators are used. Figure
5.10 shows a typical experimental open-loop FRF corresponding to an
active cantilever beam with collocated PZT actuator and sensor patches,
similar to that of Fig.5.6. As observed earlier, this open-loop FRF does
not roll-oﬀat high frequency, and this was attributed to a feedthrough
term in the system equation; a similar situation occurs in (6.125). When

6.10 Other active damping strategies
193
the open-loop transfer function has a feedtrough component, the system
stability requires that the compensator includes some roll-oﬀ.4 The Pos-
itive Position Feedback was proposed (Goh & Caughey, 1985, Fanson &
Caughey, 1990) to achieve just that, for systems similar to that of Fig.5.6.
The controller consists of a second order ﬁlter
H(s) =
−g
s2 + 2ξfωfs + ω2
f
(6.130)
where the damping ξf is usually high (0.5 to 0.7), and the ﬁlter frequency
ωf is adapted to target a speciﬁc mode. The block diagram of the control
system is shown in Fig.6.17; the negative sign in H(s), which produces a
positive feedback, is the origin of the name of this controller.

Fig. 6.17. Block diagram of the PPF controller applied to a structure with collocated

zeros).
Figure 6.18 shows typical root loci when the PPF poles are targeted to
mode 1 and mode 2, respectively (i.e. ωf close to ω1 or ω2, respectively).
One sees that the whole locus is contained in the left half plane, except
one part on the positive real axis, but that part of the locus is reached
only for large values of g, which are not used in practice. The stability
condition can be established as follows: the characteristic equation of the
closed loop system reads
ψ(s) = 1 + gH(s)G(s) = 1 −

s2 + 2ξfωfs + ω2

ψ(s) = s2 + 2ξfωfs + ω2
f −g{
n
X
i=1
bT φiφT
i b
µi(s2 + ωi2)} = 0
According to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion for stability, if one of the
4 in the IFF control discussed earlier, there is a feedthrough in G(s), but the controller
1/s has a -20 dB/decade roll-oﬀ.

194
eﬃcients of the power expansion of the characteristic equation becomes
negative, the system is unstable. It is not possible to write the power ex-
pansion ψ(s) explicitly for an arbitrary value of n, however, one can see
easily that the constant term (in s0) is
an = ψ(0) = ω2
f −g
n
X
i=1

In this case, an becomes negative when the static loop gain becomes larger

{

(6.131)
Note that it is independent of the structural damping in the system. Since
the instability occurs for large gains which are not used in practice, the
PPF can be regarded as unconditionally stable. Unlike the lead controller
of the previous section which controls all the modes which belong to
z < ωi < p, the PPF ﬁlter must be tuned on the targeted mode (it is
therefore essential to know the natural frequency accurately), and the
authority on the modes with very diﬀerent frequencies is substantially
reduced. Several PPF ﬁlters can be used in parallel, to target several
modes simultaneously, but they must be tuned with care, because of the
cross coupling between the various loops.

6.11 Remark
Throughout this chapter, structural damping has been ignored; this as-
sumption has led to fairly simple analytical results for the closed-loop
modal active damping. In the presence of light structural damping, the
passive and active damping can simply be added.
In the absence of structural damping, the closed-loop stability has been
achieved as a result of the collocation, leading to a ﬁxed, alternating pole-
zero pattern, and because perfect actuator and sensor dynamics have been
assumed.
For non-collocated control systems, this approach is not suf-
ﬁcient, because it is not possible to stabilize (by feedback) a distributed
ﬂexible structure if the structural damping is ignored, due to spillover
(some destabilization always occurs outside the bandwidth of the con-
troller, as expressed by the Bode Integrals). Similarly, the actuator and
sensor dynamics alters the pole-zero pattern of the control system and,
here again, structural damping is necessary to achieve closed-loop stability
with imperfect actuator-sensor dynamics.
