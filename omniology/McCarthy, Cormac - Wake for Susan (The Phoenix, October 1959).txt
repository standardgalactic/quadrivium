Wake for Susan 
"Who makes the bridal bed, 
Birdie, say trulyu"-
"The grey headed Sexton 
That delves the grave duly." 
Sm. WALTER ScoTT 
It was nine o'clock on a sparklirig Saturday morn­
ing in October. The sqmels· had apparently" retired 
for a mid-morning siesta, and Wes aroseĚ little sµfiy 
from his position beneath a towering shagbarŏhickc>ry. 
An orange sun was climbing the eastern sky rapidly 
and drenching the dripping woods with an unseason­
able warmth. Wes leaned his rifle against ·the tie 
and unbuttoned his· jacket. He felt a little .irked Ư 
having mised the squirreL He had seen foJt or five,. 
but that had ben his only god shQtƶe one that 
came" "slithering dawn. the tre ·ƭy in froi;it of him 
•. 
At the shot, the squirel .Jia.d jumped· frOm. ·the side of 
the tre and for a minute w_ es. "thoUght_· that it was hit. 
Then he "heard the squlrel scamper off among the 
dead. leaves. 
· Wes picked up bis rifie and started slowly for 
home. He stil had the yard to IOW. -A wel. worn 
path·. led through the col ·shade of seond [,growth 
hardwoods- oaks and hickories. 
-. The damp'. Ieaf­
carpeted woodland fi()()r was punctured haphazarŐy 
with mos-padded grey limestone. The path led past 
thT.remnants of an abandoned qu_any. WƳ pause4 to 
chunk. a ;rock into the gren. algaƩ ®ƪ water .of 
the .quauy hole. Th.en he nun.eel off ·onto the railwad. 
track. It-was: longer home ti;ls way md haitleő-ś"'. 
ing .am,ong the Œ t!-es an4 lechěus p.oneysucklœ. 
The saging rails were brown and rusty with disuse. 
Wes walked Ŕong. thein, placing one ,oot· -- 
in ·Ĝt of the othŕr. °faling off every fĝ ·steps. He 
followed the path of the old bed uritil it fumed.east 
acros brown harvested fields. Then he turned in.to the 
woOds a.gain. 
In a-rain-washed.red clay· guley he .stooped a,nd 
picked up a fiaĞnğ hog-iifie. bal .He sciaped:, the 
mud frQm Ʊ- oxidizĠ lead and examined . .dt.· Well. 
Wes wondered,whe_n it bad ben fu'ed;who. had fired 
it, and at what,:ot·whom.? Perhaps some Carly settler 
0r explorer haŖ aimed it at a menacing ·Indian. Moie 
3 
likely it had been intenŗed for game . for a table of 
some later date, when the. Indians wŘ ap. g0I1e. Per­
haps it had been fired only thirty or forty years ago. 
The old muzrl.e-loaders were used in  part of the 
country until fairly recently, he knew. 
· 
As Wes examined the rifle-bal, the woods became 
popUiated with ghosts of ean, rangy frontiersrilen with 
powder-horns and .bullet pouches slung . from their 
shoulders and canying long-bareled, · -brass-.trimed 
rifles with brown and ,gold maple stocks. 
. , 
. 
. 
. 
. Wes pockUted._the rellc and walked quiřtly through 
time-haunted ,woods. 
· It·was probably _the ġcovery ·of the Pfie-bal that 
prompted hin to· look· far the burial piot. He· had' 
ben there "onɮ before 
.. With the Ford boy and.thought 
that he could find it again. 
He increased his pace tUJ.til b,e. came .to. the road. 
Crosing to,the other sjde, .I?-e .climbed-ĥgh .a dis'.. 
reputable looking barbed-wire fence, and struck out 
in the direction of the bunal groƵd. ·The ·t:rceS were 
strong with glistening dew-beaded -spider webs; which 
Wes oetasionaly ran mtoĢ an· the ·sun\vas geting

The cemetery was .  nOt exactly. where he renieni­
beted it being, and ·he Stumbled ui>on it almost by·

1834, for instance, was a year oi;te could ,rem.emɯ 

ber. In this year, a stone  the Source of Life has 
·reclaimed His own.,..-0ne Susan Ledbetter. Susan had 
lived on the earth a ful seventeen -years. 
From a simple carved stone, the marble turned to 
a monument; from a gravestone, to thĈ surviving 
inte_gral tie to a once warm-blooded, live person. Wes 
pictured Susan: 
She was blue-eyed and yellow-haired, soft and 
bright in her homespun dres. ( 1834 was a year one 
could remember; not like 1215, or 1066, but a real 
year.) Susan sat at the table 
·witli her parents and 
brothers and eyed with pardonable pride the meal 
she and her mother had prepared. 
There were stacks of steaming golde:q corri.bread 
eager to soak up the fresh churned butter. A bowl of 
collard .greens and one of pinto beans, each laced 
delicately with the flavor of pork scraps, And the 
fragrait platter of fried pork tenderloin. Stewed apples 
crowded- in a chipĘ blue cbinaware Çwl, and ɪ 
earthen ·crock of cool butermilk promised respite 
from the heat . of the . day. As Susan watched her 
brothers eat she swelled with womanly pride. 
Susan should have a lover, and the lover looked 
mangely like Wes ... He· caine courtlig, a gaD:gling 18 
year old, with_ dark serious eyę anĚ a _quicě grin. · 
On M sumer evenings they sat on the front 
stoop and talked about the things they knew: neigh­
b9rs and folks and .crops and childhood. and parenĉ. 
The. _boy tried to tell_ her funy things ·he had heard 
the men _ Ċy -a,N Josh ƫƬ·.s store, but they neƤ 
had the same ring to them.·· She laughed, 0r smiled, 
but he felt an empty flatness in their ɫti.ti.ɬ. And 
so he toid her the things he dreamed· of, ƦY 
at fi'st, but alys dark eyed and senous:' He sPoke 
softly and Slowly, looking up froni the grol.ind ·ocaÈ 
sionaily tQ gl;mƨ aċ her; or inadvCrtently stop her 
heaJ;t with his quick grin: 
They É death and bas-&hing and square 
dances, Ĝd tb.e epic "of life aro:und them semed to 
unf<;>ld. Êey b:n.parted to each other a great deal of 
understanding. 
And so they fell -in 1ove; he first _with her eyes 
and hands and then her shoulclers and soft rounded 
hips; she with arpis and neck and d. own hair. 
Not that they spoke of these things. No words of 
love pased between them, and at Digb.t ·when ·he 
kised her standlig there on the stoop and wheeled 
' 
around and headed for the gate, it semed that .he 
must tell her how he· felt. He would ti.rn at the gate 
and look back· and see her standing luminescent be­
neath· the autumn stars and he wanted to
· run back 
and crush her. in his arms and whisper wild thlngs in 
her ear. But he simply ;raised his hand and she hers, 
and he ambled b.ome emptily beneath wind-tortured 
trees that spoke.in behalf of the silent stars: 
You walk here, as so many others have walked. 
The ancient oaks have seen fhem. The lifesap courses 
through these twisted li1J.bs as it 'flows hot through 
your veins-for awhile. The branching creek-rooted 
cottontood cares not for the trees- that sucked at this 
damp earth _betore its ·birth, but only for the earth, 
and the sunwarmth, and the seed. YOU walk here. 
Moonwarmed and wind-kissed,. you walk here 
• . 
• 
for awhile. 
And the boy ambled home and eased wearily into 
bed and tossed and. rolled so that the bed.;ropes had 
to be tightened for the sĝd time in two weeks. 
In October the .first frost glazed this rČote _valley. 
The harvestfug was done and POns were being 
made for ·wmtet. ··0reat stores of foo4 were being 
laid away in earthy" cellm and musty smoke-hQuses. 
The rich smell of wOod -smoke 1mig ii the valey, 
promising the peace and wamrth of winter mghts 
before a friendly ƥ- The savOr:y aroma of hog-meat 
being coked in great black outdoor. ketles spoke of 
bountiful tables end festivity within the house-warmč 
of winter. It was· a very god time of .year.- The time­
of year when one reflects with satisfaction on a well 
done sumer's work. 
For Susan it was a very·god.tim.e·of year. She 
kept busy with endles· househOld :chores and minded 
them Ii.ot in the least. _In fact, she wa8 ba.fely copscious 
of them and m<>re than once was stirprised, ·ttpon turn­
ing to some project or other, to discover that .she had 
a1readjr dOne it. 
Had she ben supe1&ti:tlous, _she ni.ight ·have in­
sisted that sOm.Ƨ kind fairy folk had Washed thcdoma.: 
toes that she left on "the "sideboard. 
Perhaps· her thoughts were a litle too much takĞn 
with a tal lean and dark-eyedĎď- (to lier he was 
very much a man, and perhaps he-was,) As yet there 
had ben ·no serious talk betwen them, -but she knew, 
and she was wiling to permit-him to, take his ti.me. 
The question of her futtire W8s setled qËte Đbly 
and 4er yo:uth told.her al wa.S well. Give him time; 
al wil be well 

The boy himself was likewise ·busy with .chores. 
It was a busy time of year, a good time-of. year. The 
crisp mornings got one out of bed almost by· force. 
Fried eggs and sausage tasted so much ·better when 
there was frost in the air. As ·he swung out the door 
swinging the milk pail the tingling air filled his ·nostrils 
with seductive promises. 
Chickens scattered at his approach, clucking ner­
vously._ He swung his pail at them and laughed as 
they broke into panic. Passfug the wood ric hɕ 
noted with satisfaction that nearly an the " logs had 
been cut and . .stackedɖ .in martial .. order between poles 
driven ·into the ground. There was a full cord of shiny 
triangular sticks of split yellow pine kindling. The 
very air seemed glutinous with rich plenty. tR.eaching 
the barn (it was a small shɗ of. ɘy əthered 
planki:1J.g), he loosened the leather thonɚ _from the 
nail and entered with -a loud and hɛ greeting for 
the surprised milch cow. 
Diurnal forces carpeted the forest floor with thick 
layers of chunchy brm\'n leaves, . tom from the lialf­
naked ·tres. Lorig enough these leaves had shaded 
the ·woOded ridges and slopes . .- Now they return.eel to 
the earth to decay and so provide life and sustenanee 
for their unformed successors. 'Long enough, leaves. 
The year ɧas 1834, ɜd .a very, fine .Yɨ it was. 
It was fal, and that is a gC?Qd time of Yɩ·-
. 
. 
In a rocky woodland glen,. a minor tragedy occur­
red.· A fox, a litle lean (evep.. foxes walk noisily in 
crisp leaves)ɝ had mɞaged to cut off a 'Very frightened 
striped · chipniUilk. froIIi . hls home among· the piled 
Stones. The. fox sprang full upon the chipmunk, :but 
before he.couJ.d get bis sharp ·little teeth into the fury 
prize, it had slipPecI between ·his legs. ·The fox whirled 
frantically and pounced again, this: time pinning ·the 
chipmunk between bis .forepaws. -Cautiously he- low­
ered bis head to complete. the capture. He opened his 
mouth. and released the pressure of his paws, but the. 
chipmunk was too quick · for him. His teth -clicked 
with a clear ringing· snap in the "frosty· airɤ 
The chipinunk was a flash of golden brown' streak':' 
ing for a creVice in the ·roeks: Just as .it gamed ·this 
refuge, ·the' fox, by a combination -Af agmty ·Ơd luck, 
pined it 'down ·witl;t. fue· paw. ··But the chipmunk was 
inside the creVice an.d thɦ fOx eould ·not get hi$ sliarp

it. Furthermore the chipmuDk '1vas wODning (ƣ 
even under the pressure of the fox's pavt, ·Until ii was 
wedged down into the rocks where the fox ·could not 
dig it out. The fox thrust his face into the crevice as 
far as it would go, which left the wann fragrance of 
the chipmunk several inches ơ front of his noseɟ and 
whined like ·a puppy. He scraped and :e!awed at the 
chipmunk until it was b!Oody and lifeless,
. 
mɠed 
loudly; and with one last despairing wliine trotted off 
through the noisy leaves, leaving the chipmunk for 
the smaller carnivores. 
The weather had grown too cold for out of do0r 
sparking. (It was October and the valley shone· With 
white glistɡg frost beneath the long slanted rays of 
the rising sun.).It was good:hunting weather and.the 
woods echoed Periodically. with the sharp crack of 
rifies or the deeper hollow sound of the fowling piece. 
But the weather had grown too cold for out of door 
.sparking. Susan and the b(?y occasionally .sat in the 
front room of her house on cbily eVenings ariƢ hared 
conversation with her parents a.nci her bi'Other8. The 
brothers were tolerant, but a little amused, and they 
made the boy uncomfortable. 
Sometimes everyone would-.go to bed and leave 
the two of them alone for a little while ®fore the 
boy had to depart. On these ocasions the boY was 
even· more ..flustered: than when the· family. was in· the 
rom.Z 
He would say, "Well Susan,· I guess Pd beter ·be 
getting along._" And she would. say, "O· don't gɥ just 
yet, it's not so late." And he would say, "Well, · tn 
have to be leaving pretty .soon," and .look darkly at 
her until she lowered her head with. an embarased 
smile and then he would reach over a.little awkwardly 
and .kis her on the cheek. She would look up, just a 
little, and he would h<ld her shoulders and kis her 
on the mouth. Nothing was ever -so. -soft . and warm 
anci sweet scented. He would.hold her for awhile; not 
speaking, but his breath catching a little in bis throat, 
distrasting bis voice altogether. 
After awhile she 
would look up at bim, rather boldly, he thought, and 
ask him woJJld she se him tomorrow, or would he 
be at Arwoodɢs Saturday night, or what, and he would 
answer -as best he could, kiss her on. the cheek and 
say he'd better be going and rise stiffly and. stand 
·there .stoically, or maybe even stretch; and .then cros 
the room, feeling awkward, and get his coat. 
At the door· her kis would be full elf meaning 
and he would tumble out into thɣ -sharp- night air and 
run most ·of ɤe way home. The stars promised they 
would be back again tomorrow night. 

Susan would stand at the dor until he was out 
of sight, breathing very quietly and imagining lrim 
stil there with his arms around her. 
Then she would cany the lamp into her room 
and look at herself to se what there was about her 
that made him think she was such a delicate piece of 
china. 
Undresing quickly in the ·cold "litle room, she 
wotld tumble into bed. She would se him again 
tomorrow night. 
The· stars -came back; if ·their-luster paled, it was 
because a part of beauty was no longer there to 
receive them. In his eyes they swam blurred and 
distorted in a salt sea. The year was· 1834 and it was 
October. · 
How had she died? The mute stone left n<? testi­
mony.· There were so many ways. 
A sea of love and pity welled up in Wes. Great 
tears pushed one another down his cheek. He threw 
his arms around the unyielding stone and wept for 
lost Susan, for al the lost Susans, for. al the people; 
so beautiful, so pathetic, so lost and Wasted .  and un­
grieved. 
Later Wes arose from the spot, drained and empty. 
He picked up his rifle and started .for home. Winds· 
were about. A. little band of dead leaves jumped up 
beneath his feet and frolicked and tumbled ahead of 
him. then did a ÿrderly right oblique and scampered 
crazily d.own a sunny woodland coridor, leaping and 
dancing before the wind in a travesty of life. 
Wes smiled. Leaves tired and droped sighing 
. from branches. 
Long enough, leaves. 
He smiled, and walked home, towering even 
m;non.g the lean tres.
