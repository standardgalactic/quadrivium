Introduction
Middle school is an exciting time of your life. It’s full of changes and challenges. By eighth
grade, you are expected to be proﬁcient in a number of areas—you’ll be required to take tests that mea-
sure your reading, writing, and math skills. So, take the time now to brush up your math skills before
you hit high school. 
 HOW THIS BOOK CAN HELP YOU
If you’re having trouble in math, this book can help you get on the right track. Even if you feel pretty
conﬁdent about your math skills, you can use this book to help you review what you’ve already learned
and practice with the same kinds of questions you’ll see on standardized and classroom math tests, so
you are sure to be prepared for the coming challenges of high school.
Many study guides tell you how to improve your math—this book doesn’t just tell you how to
solve math problems, it shows you how. You’ll ﬁnd page after page of strategies that work, and you are
never left stranded wondering how to get the right answer to a problem. You are shown all the steps
to take so that you can successfully solve every single problem, and see the strategies at work. This
book is like your own personal math tutor!
With help from this book, you will be prepared for the higher-level mathematics you’ll encounter
in high school. So, now’s the time to improve your math skills because you will use them—both now
and in the future—in school, at work, and in your personal life. As you work through this book, you
will become more conﬁdent in math and you can pass standardized tests and classroom math tests more
easily.

 HOW THIS BOOK IS ORGANIZED
This book is organized into eight sections, or major areas of math, such as fractions, decimals, algebra,
and geometry. Each section is divided into short lessons that explain the main concepts you need to
know. Each lesson tells you what kinds of key words and problems to look for when you are solving
math problems, and gives you step-by-step strategies to solve each kind of problem you will encounter.
Sometimes math books assume you can follow explanations of difﬁcult concepts even when they
move quickly or leave out steps. That’s not the case with this book. In each lesson, you’ll ﬁnd step-by-
step strategies for tackling the different kinds of math problems you are likely to ﬁnd on standardized
tests and classroom math tests. Then, you’re given a chance to apply what you’ve learned with hun-
dreds of practice problems. Answers to the practice problems are provided at the end of each section,
so you can check your progress as you go along.
As you work through this book, you’ll notice that the lessons are sprinkled with all kinds of help-
ful tips and icons. Look for these icons and the tips they provide.
Shortcut
When you see this icon, you’ll know that a quicker, easier way to
solve a math problem follows. You’ll ﬁnd this icon both in the lessons and in
the answer key, so you can practice the shortcuts and see how they work in real
problems.
Test Taking Tip
This icon tells you about tips especially useful for taking
math tests. They cover additional strategies or well-organized information you
can use as a reference, long after you’ve worked through all the lessons in the
book. 
Think About It
This icon is used to signal another way of looking at a prob-
lem or concept. You’ll get extra information and more in-depth discussions when
you see this icon.
Real World Problems
Each section ends with a set of Real World Problems. These aren’t the same
old practice problems you’ll ﬁnd in other math books. These problems apply the skills you’ve learned
in each section to situations you encounter every day. As you work through these problems, you’ll see
that the skills you’re learning aren’t important only for math tests. They are also important skills to
know for questions that come up every day.

A WORD ABOUT WORD PROBLEMS
If you’re looking speciﬁcally for help with word problems, you’ve come to the right
place! Every section of this book includes word problems and step-by-step strategies for
solving them. Not only do most of the lessons end with word problems, but every single
section ends with a set of word problems that you’ll encounter in the real world. 
In addition to including lots of word problems for you to practice on, these Real World
Problem sections include test-taking tips for tackling all kinds of word problems. That’s
not all—the answer key will walk you through solving every word problem. You’ll feel like
you have your own personal tutor.
 HOW TO USE THIS BOOK
You should get started by taking the Pretest. You’ll test your math skills and see where you might need
to focus your study.
Then, begin the lessons, study the example problems, and try your hand at the practice problems.
Check your answers as you go along, so if you miss a question, you can study a little more before mov-
ing on to the next lesson.
After you’ve completed all 21 lessons in the book, try your hand at the Posttest to see how much
you’ve learned. You’ll also be able see any areas where you may need a little more practice. You can go
back to the section that covers that skill for some more review and practice.
Good luck, and let’s get started!

Getting 
Started
 PRETEST
Before you start Lesson 1, you might want to take this short Pretest. The Pretest is 25 multiple-
choice questions that cover the basic concepts and skills covered in this book. Of course, every skill,
shortcut, concept, and type of problem in the book cannot be covered in only 25 questions; however,
the Pretest can give you a general idea of which skills you know well and which skills you might need
to work on.
You can use the answer sheet on the next page to record your answers to the Pretest. Or, you can
simply circle your answers as you work through the Pretest. If this book doesn’t belong to you, write
the numbers 1-25 on a sheet of your own paper and record your answers there.
Take your time to work through the Pretest. Don’t feel rushed. It may take a few questions to get
your mind thinking about math. When you have completed the Pretest, check your answers against
the answer key at the end of the test.

 PRETEST ANSWERS AND EXPLANATIONS
1. a.
Begin by calculating the volume of the water. Use the formula for the volume of a rectan-
gular solid to calculate the volume of the water: V = Ah = lwh. The area of the base is 16
inches2 and the height of the water is 9 inches, so to get the volume of the water in the
pitcher you plug these known measures into the formula and solve:
V = Ah = lwh
V = (16 in2)(9 in)
V = 144 in3
So, the volume of the water is 144 in3.
Next, calculate the volume of the vase. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V = Ah
or V = πr2h. So, you plug in the measures and solve:
V = πr2h
V = π(2)2(11)
V = π(4)(11)
V = π(44)
V = 138.16
So the volume of the vase is about 138 cm3, and this volume is smaller than the volume
of water in the pitcher, so the vase will overﬂow if Anne tries to ﬁll it with all the water in
the pitcher. These concepts are covered in Lesson 19.
2. d. Because 3 out of 8 total parts are shaded, you know that 3
8
, or three-eighths, of the whole
ﬁgure is shaded. This concept is covered in Lesson 3.
3. c. To change the improper fraction 1
4
2 to a whole number, just divide 12 by 4: 12 ÷ 4 = 3. So,
your answer is 3. This concept is covered in Lesson 6.
4. d. Look at the chart and ﬁnd the number of miles jogged on Tuesday and Thursday. Laurie
jogged 31
3
 miles on Tuesday and 21
3
 miles on Thursday, so you subtract: 31
3
 −21
3
. The
answer is 31
3
 −21
3
. These concepts are covered in Lessons 4 and 15.
5. c. The formula for ﬁnding an average (or mean) is as follows:
Average = 
So you need to begin by ﬁnding the total number of miles Laurie jogged for the week
given: 4 + 3 + 31
3
 + 5 + 21
3
 + 22
3
 + 3. When adding mixed numbers, ﬁrst add the whole
numbers, then add the fractions. Next, combine the whole number sum with the fraction
sum. If you add the whole numbers, you get 4 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 22. Adding the frac-
tions gives you 1
3
 + 1
3
 + 2
3
 = 4
3
. The improper 4
3
 converts to the mixed number 11
3
. So you
add 22 and 11
3
 to get 231
3
 miles. Now you are ready to plug the numbers into the average

Average = 
The fraction bar is a division sign, so you can simplify this problem by writing it as the fol-
lowing division problem: 231
3
 ÷ 7. You can further simplify your division by converting the
mixed number to an improper fraction. Multiply 23 × 3, add 1, and then put this over 3:
Now you are ready to divide: 7
3
0 ÷ 7. Write the whole number 7 as a fraction (7
1
), invert it
(1
7
) and multiply: 7
3
0 × 1
7
. Using canceling, you can simplify the multiplication:

The improper fraction 1

miles per day. These concepts are covered in Lessons 3–6 and 11.
6. a.
Begin by setting up a proportion:

Then, cross multiply and solve for x. You can simplify the multiplication by ﬁrst convert-
ing the mixed number 51

9. b. Divide the total amount ($27.90) by six students. To do this, you need to ﬁrst set up the
division problem. Begin by writing the decimal point in the answer portion of the division
problem. It should go just above the decimal point in the problem. Now you are ready to
divide:

Your ﬁnal answer is $4.65. These concepts are covered in Lesson 8.

Lesson 9.
11. c. Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
 You have the percent: 17%.
 You have the whole: 3,400. 
 You are looking for the part. 
Then, use the following equation to solve the problem: Whole × Percent = Part. Plug in
the parts of the equation that you know: Part = 3,400 × 0.17 = 578. The answer is 578.
These concepts are covered in Lesson 10.
12. d. According to the graph, 21% of total monthly expenses go toward food, so you need to
ﬁnd 21% of $1,500. Twenty-one percent is equal to 0.21 and of means to multiply: 0.21 ×
1,500= 315. So Charlie spends $315 on food each month. But the problem asks how much
he spends on food in two months, so you need to multiply 315 by 2 to get your ﬁnal
answer: $630. These concepts are covered in Lesson 14.
13. c. To ﬁnd the sale price of the scanner, you need to subtract the discount (15% of the regular
price) from the regular price. So the correct answer is $448 −(0.15 × $448). These con-
cepts are covered in Lesson 10.
14. c. Break the math symbols down as follows:

So the answer is 15 more than 3 times a number is 32. These concepts are covered in
Lessons 16 and 17.
15. d. Begin by letting x = the number you are looking for. Then, set up an algebraic equation
and solve for x. From the problem, you know that subtracting 42 from x gives you 56, so 
x −42 = 56
Then, add 42 to each side of the equation to solve for x.
x −42 =
56 
+ 42 + 42
x
=
98
So the ﬁnal answer is 98. These concepts are covered in Lesson 17.
16. b. You know that the triangles ΔRST and ΔUWT are similar because two of their angles are
congruent. Both triangles have right angles and angles 1 and 2 are vertical angles (which
are congruent). The sides of similar triangles are proportional. So you can set up a pro-
portion to solve for the missing length.

So, y = 20. These concepts are covered in Lesson 20.
17. b. From the diagram, you know that the sum of angles 1 and 2 is 90°. You also know that
angle 2 is 60° because it is vertical to (or opposite of) another 60° angle. To calculate the
measure of angle 1, you simply subtract: 90 −60 = 30. So the answer is 30°. These con-
cepts are covered in Lesson 18.
18. b. To solve this problem, you simply follow the order of operations. First, multiply and
divide numbers in order from left to right. You multiply 5 by 2, then divide 16 by 4:
5 × 2 + 16 ÷ 4 = 10 + 4 
Then, add and subtract numbers in order from left to right:
10 + 4 = 14
So, the ﬁnal answer is 14. These concepts are covered in Lesson 1. 
19. a. The problem is asking you to calculate the square root of 324 because the area of a square
is side × side, or side2. So, you ask yourself what number multiplied by itself equals 324: 18
× 18 is 324. Thus, the square root of 324 is 18, and the length of one side of a square with
an area of 324 square inches is 18 inches. These concepts are covered in Lesson 2.

20. a. First, determine the probability that each event will occur. Notice that the ﬁrst event—
drawing a purple button out of the sack—affects the probability of the second event
because it changes both the number of purple buttons still in the sack, as well as the total
number of buttons in the sack. The probability of drawing the ﬁrst purple button is 1

and the probability of drawing a second purple button is 2

21. b. Notice that ACD forms a right triangle. So you can use the Pythagorean Theorem 
(a2 + b2 = c2) to solve for the missing length. First, match up the variables a, b, and c with
the parts of the right triangle. For example, you might let a = the length of A––D
–– and b =
the length of D
––C
––. The variable c must equal the length of A––C
–– because it is the
hypotenuse. Next, plug the known lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve.
a2 + b2 = c2
62 + b2 = 102
36 + b2 = 100
36 + b2 = 100
−36        −36
b2 =   64

b = 8
So, the length of the missing leg is 8. These concepts are covered in Lesson 21.
22. a. There are four red tokens (favorable outcomes) and twelve total tokens (possible out-
comes). Plug these numbers into the equation for probability:

23. d. First, determine the missing length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Since the tri-
angle is a right triangle, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the missing

So the length of the hypotenuse is 26 cm. Now you are ready to calculate the perimeter of
the triangle: 24 + 10 + 26 = 60. So your ﬁnal answer is 60 cm. These concepts are covered
in Lessons 19 and 21.
24. d. Los Angeles to Chicago is 2,054 miles. Chicago to Boston is 994 miles. Add the two:
2,054 + 994 = 3,048. So you would drive 3,048 miles. These concepts are covered in
Lesson 15.
25. c. To evaluate an algebraic expression means to ﬁnd its value by plugging in the known val-
ues of its variables. So begin by replacing the variable n with the number 3: 
m = n (10 −3) + (15 −n)
= 3 (10 −3) + (15 −3)
Follow the order of operations and solve for m.
= 3 (10 −3) + (15 −3)
= 3 (7) + (12)
= 21 + 12
= 33
Thus, the answer is 33. These concepts are covered in Lessons 1 and 16.

LESSON SUMMARY
Many math problems require you to do more than one calculation.
This lesson will show you how to determine which calculations to
do and the order to do them in. This lesson will also help you review
adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing whole numbers.
Whole numbers are made up of ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. In this lesson, you will
work only with whole numbers. In later lessons, you will learn speciﬁc ways to deal with numbers that
come in between whole numbers. These numbers include 6.5, 1

 SOLVING PROBLEMS WITH MULTIPLE STEPS
You are familiar with the four basic operations, or ways of calculating: adding, subtracting, multiplying,
and dividing. Sometimes a problem will ask you to do more than one operation. For example, if you
are asked to solve this problem, what should you do?
8 × 3 + 20 ÷ 4 =
You could do the operations in order from left to right. That is, you could multiply (8 × 3 = 24), add
(24 + 20 = 44), then divide (44 ÷ 4 = 11) to get 11. But you would not get the correct answer. The cor-

rect answer is 29. It looks tricky, but it’s not if you know the order of operations. The order of operations
involves three simple steps. When you follow these steps, you will get the correct answer.
 THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS
Step 1: Do all the operations in parentheses.
Step 2: Multiply and divide numbers in order from left to right.
Step 3: Add and subtract numbers in order from left to right.
Example: 2 + 5 −(9 ÷ 3) × 2 =
To solve this problem, you should follow the steps in the table above. 
Step 1: Do the operations in parentheses ﬁrst.
2 + 5 −(9 ÷ 3) × 2 =
2 + 5 −(3) × 2 =
Step 2: Multiply.
2 + 5 −6 =
Step 3: Add and subtract numbers in order, from left to right.
7 −6 = 1
If you have a series of numbers to add or multiply, the order
will not affect your final answer. You can group the numbers
in a way that makes the addition or multiplication easier.
Examples:
3 + 6 = 6 + 3
9 × 2 = 2 × 9
(2 + 3) + 5 = 2 + (3 + 5)
4 × (6 × 8) = (4 × 6) × 8
So, if you were asked to solve the following problem
27 + 5 + 3 + 15 =
you might group 27 + 3 and 5 + 15 to make the math easier and
faster. Do you see how grouping can make a problem easier? How
could you group the numbers in the following problem to make
it easier?
12 × 7 × 5 =

If you know that 12 × 5 is 60, you could do this calculation ﬁrst.
Then calculate 60 × 7 (420). Notice that if you did 12 × 7 ﬁrst,
then you would end with 84 × 5, which isn’t as quick to calculate
at 60 × 7. Regrouping the numbers can speed up your calculations.
Keep in mind that all of the operations in the series must
be either addition or multiplication for this shortcut to
work. Also, remember that the order of the numbers in sub-
traction and division is important. You cannot change the
order of subtraction and division numbers and still get the
correct answer.

 CHOOSING AN OPERATION
Often a problem will tell you exactly which operation you should do. However, sometimes you will
have to translate the words in a word problem into the operations. Look for these clues when you have
to choose the operations.
You add (+) when you are asked to
 ﬁnd a sum
 ﬁnd a total
 combine amounts
Key words to look for:
 sum
 total
 altogether
You subtract (−) when you are asked to

 take away an amount
 compare quantities
Key words to look for:
 difference
 take away
 how many more than

 split an amount into equal parts
Key words to look for:
 quotient
 per
Example: Add the product of 6 and 3 to the sum of 10 and 4.
To solve this problem, begin by translating the words into math symbols. You know from the lists on
the previous page and above on this page that the word product means to multiply. So you will need to
multiply 6 and 3. You also know that sum means to add. Thus, you could write the problem like this: 
6 × 3 + 10 + 4 =
Now follow the order of operations to solve the problem you have written:
Step 1: There are no parentheses. Skip to Step 2.
Step 2: Multiply.
6 × 3 + 10 + 4 =
18 + 10 + 4 =
Step 3: Add in order from left to right.
28 + 4 = 32
Example: Elsa and Thuy went to a movie at the cinema. They shared a large popcorn. Each girl paid
for her own drink. The movie cost $6.25. The popcorn cost $4.50. Each drink cost $2. How much did
each girl pay?
Begin by translating the words into math symbols. The cost of the popcorn should be divided between
the two girls. So, each girl paid 
6.25 + (4.50 ÷ 2) + 2 =
Now solve the problem following the order of operations.
Step 1: Do operations in parentheses ﬁrst.
6.25 + (2.25) + 2 =
Step 2: There is no multiplication or division. Skip to Step 3.
Step 3: Add.
8.5 + 2 = 10.50
Each girl paid $10.50 for the movie and food.

Squares and
Square Roots
LESSON SUMMARY
Some math problems will ask you to calculate a square or a square
root of a number. This lesson will explain what squares and square
roots are and show you how to calculate them.
When you think of a square, you probably think of a box-shaped ﬁgure with four equal sides
like the one shown here. As you’ll see in this lesson, that’s a good way to think about squares and square
roots. 
 FINDING SQUARES
A square of a number is just the number multiplied by itself. So the square of 4 is 4 × 4 = 16. How does
this relate to a square-shaped ﬁgure? The area of a square is the amount of space a square takes up. To

calculate the area of a square, you multiply the length of one side by itself. That is why the area of a
square is sometimes written as s squared, or s2. Any time a number is written with a 2 raised after it, it
means to multiply the number by itself, or to square the number.
Example: What is the square of 30?
To ﬁnd the square of a number, multiply it by itself. Thus, the square of 30 is 30 × 30, or 900.
Example: Find 92.
When a number is followed by a raised 2, you should square it. Thus, 92 = 9 × 9 = 81.
Although you can always calculate the square of a number by
multiplying, it’s a good idea to memorize common squares
for standardized tests. Here are some common squares you
might want to learn.

 FINDING SQUARE ROOTS
To ﬁnd a square root of a number you have to think backwards. You will be given the area of an entire
square. The answer to the problem, or square root, is the length of only one side of the square. That is,
the square root of a number is a number that when multiplied by itself equals the number given in the
problem. Keep reading. It’s not as tricky as it sounds.
You may have seen this symbol before: . This is the symbol for a square root. When it is
written over a number, you are being asked to ﬁnd the square root of that number.
Example: What is 25
?
The problem is asking you to calculate the square root of 25. Ask yourself what number multiplied by
itself equals 25. If you have memorized the list of common squares, this problem is not very hard. Even
Finding Squares and Square Roots
LESSON 2    
IMPROVE YOUR MATH
25
 
Team-LRN

if you haven’t learned the list of common squares yet, though, you can ﬁgure this problem out: 5 × 5
= 25. So the square root of 25 is 5.
Example: What is the length of one side of a square that has an area of 121 square inches?
The problem is asking you to calculate the square root of 121. Ask yourself what number multi-
plied by itself equals 121? You know that 11 × 11 is 121. Thus, the square root of 121 is 11, and
the length of one side of a square with an area of 121 square inches is 11 inches.
If you aren’t sure what the square root of a given square is,
make a guess. Then multiply the number by itself. If it’s not
the correct square root, at least now you can make a better
guess the second time!

In this lesson, you are working only with whole numbers. How-
ever, sometimes math problems will ask you to calculate
square roots that are not whole numbers. Read the question
carefully. You might be asked to round your answer to a cer-
tain place. In other cases, you might be able to use a calcu-
lator to solve the problem.
EXAMPLE: What is 45
?
The problem is asking you what number equals 45 when
multiplied by itself. You know that 62 = 36 and 72 = 49.
Thus, the square root of 45 is a number between 6 and
7. You can find a more precise answer using a calculator.

Some word problems contain information that is not needed
to solve the problem. Read the question carefully. Then
focus only on the information you need to answer that ques-

29. First, calculate the number of hours Teresa babysat over the weekend. She babysat for 9.5 hours
(2 + 4 + 3.5). Since she charges $4.50 per hour for babysitting, multiply the number of hours
she babysat by $4.50. One way to set up the problem is as follows: (2 + 4 + 3.5) × $4.5 = $42.74.
Thus, Teresa made $42.74 babysitting over the weekend.

28. The problem is asking you to calculate the square root of 144. Ask yourself what number mul-
tiplied by itself equals 144. You know that 12 × 12 is 144. Thus, the square root of 144 is 12,
and the length of one side of a square with an area of 144 square inches is 12 inches.

 REAL WORLD PROBLEMS
1. Divide the number of pages Phat needs to read by the number of weeks he has to read them.
One way to set up the problem is as follows: 168 pages ÷ 4 weeks = 42 pages per week. Thus,
Phat should read 42 pages per week.
2. First, calculate how much each purchase costs. To buy the $85 backpack, Maria would need $100
($85 + $15). Thus, Maria should buy the $79 backpack because she doesn’t have enough money
to buy both the $85 backpack and the CD.
3. Aidan made ﬁve sales. One way to set up the problem is as follows: 5 × (2 + 3) = $25. Thus, the
club will receive $25 from Aidan’s sales. The selling prices of the clocks are not relevant to the
problem.
4. First, calculate the number of lifeguards needed for the party. Then, calculate the cost of the
lifeguards. One way to set up the problem is as follows: 60 ÷ 20 × 3 hours × $8 per hour = $72.
Thus, the lifeguards will cost $72.
5. First, determine the length of one side of the square. The square root of 64 is 8, and the length
of one side of a square with an area of 64 square feet is 8 feet. Then, calculate the perimeter of
the square: 8 feet × four sides of a square = 32 feet. Thus, they will need 32 feet of gold fringe.

LESSON SUMMARY
In Section 1, you learned some ways to work with whole numbers.
In this lesson, you will begin working with fractions—numbers that
represent parts of whole numbers. You will learn what fractions
are and how to write them. You will also learn how to reduce a
fraction to lowest terms and how to convert a fraction to higher
terms. Lastly, you will use these skills to compare fractions.
What exactly is a fraction? Imagine that you and a friend order a whole pizza for yourselves.
The pizza is cut into nine slices. 
If one of you eats the whole pizza and doesn’t share with the other one, then you would eat nine
of the nine slices, or 9
9
. But what if you ate two slices and your friend ate three slices? Then you ate 2

of the pizza, your friend ate 3

9
 of the pizza is left over. The numbers 2
9
, 3
9
, and 4
9
 are
all fractions.
 WRITING AND RECOGNIZING FRACTIONS
Notice that fractions are two numbers that represent a part of a whole. The two numbers are separated
by a bar. The bar means “divide the top number by the bottom number.”
The top number is called the numerator. The numerator tells you how many parts of the whole
are being talked about. For example, 2
9
 of the pizza shown above refers to two slices of a pizza that has
been cut into nine slices.
The bottom number in a fraction is called the denominator. The denominator tells you how many
equal parts the whole has been divided into. The pizza shown previously has been divided into nine
slices, so the denominator is 9. What if you had cut the pizza into eight slices? Then the denominator
would be 8.
You can keep the numerator and the denominator straight by
remembering that both denominator and down begin with the
letter d. The denominator is down below the bar.
Think about some other common fractions. 
 We use fractions to talk about money. For example, a quarter is 25 cents, or 1
4
 of a dollar.
Four quarters, or 1
4
, equal one dollar.
 We also use fractions to talk about time. An hour is a fraction of a day. One hour is 2
1
4 of a
whole day. One day is a fraction of a week: 1
7
. What fraction of a year is one month?
 Your school grades are probably written in fractions. If you receive a 90 out of a total of
100 possible points, then your grade is the fraction 1

. Some teachers grade out of 20

 Sometimes you will see fractions in ads. A department store might have a sale of one-half
off last season’s styles. That means that you pay only 1
2
 of the whole price.
Example: Write a fraction to represent the part of the whole that is shaded in.
To solve this problem, you ﬁrst count the number of equal parts the whole is divided into. The
ﬁgure is divided into 16 squares of equal size, so the denominator of the fraction is 16. Then count
the number of the parts that are shaded in: 4. So the fraction of the whole that is shaded in is 1
4
6.
A pizza is one thing. But sometimes a whole might refer to
a group of things. For example, a six-pack of soft drinks is
six things, but only one whole. Think of some other exam-
ples of wholes that aren’t single objects.

the assignments. What fraction of the homework assignments did you turn in? What fraction of the
homework assignments did you fail to turn in?
First, determine the denominator. There are 10 homework assignments, so the denominator of
both fractions is 10. You turned in 8 homework assignments, so you turned in 1
8
0 of the assignments.
You didn’t turn in 2 of the homework assignments, so you are missing 1

 REDUCING FRACTIONS TO LOWEST TERMS
The numerator and the denominator of a fraction are called terms. Often the directions on math tests
will tell you to reduce fractions to lowest terms. This is the standard and usual way to write fractions. Even
if the directions do not tell you to reduce to lowest terms, you should always reduce your fractions to
lowest terms.
To reduce a fraction to lowest terms, you need to ﬁnd a fraction that is equal to the one you have
and write it with a smaller numerator and denominator. Divide both the numerator and the denomi-
nator by the same whole number. The whole number must divide evenly into both numbers. Continue
to divide the numerator and denominator until there is no number other than 1 that can divide evenly
into both numbers. If only 1 divides into both numbers evenly, then the fraction is said to be reduced to
lowest terms.
Example: Reduce 2
7
8 to lowest terms.
Begin by thinking of a number that will divide evenly into both the numerator and the denominator.
You know that 4 × 7 = 28, so you can divide both numbers by 7.

The fraction 1
4
 is equal to 2
7
8. No number other than 1 can divide into both 1 and 4 ; so 1
4
 is reduced
to lowest terms.
If you don’t know where to begin to reduce a fraction, look
at the last digits of the numerator and denominator. 
■If both the numerator and the denominator end in zero,
then cross out the same number of zeros in each number.
If you cross out one zero in each number, you are dividing
by 10. Crossing out two zeros at the end of each number
is dividing by 100.
EXAMPLE: Reduce 
7

Both 300 and 7,000 end in zeros. You can cross out two

■Often when you begin reducing a fraction by dividing by a
small number, you will have to divide more than one
time. If you can ﬁnd the largest number that divides into
both numbers, you can reduce the fraction faster—often
in only one step.

same number. For example, if you multiply 5

you are comparing fractions. You will also have to raise fractions to higher terms when you are adding
and subtracting fractions that have different denominators. You’ll learn more about adding and sub-
tracting fractions in the next lesson.
When raising a fraction to higher terms, you will usually need to ﬁnd an equal fraction with a spe-
ciﬁc denominator. Here’s how to raise a fraction to higher terms with a speciﬁc denominator.
Step 1: Divide the denominator of the fraction into the new denominator.
Step 2: Multiply the quotient, or the answer to Step 1, by the numerator.
Step 3: Write the product, or the answer to Step 2, over the new denominator.

Sometimes you will be asked to compare two or more fractions.
You might be asked which of two fractions is larger, for exam-
ple. Or you could be asked if two fractions are equal. If the
two fractions have the same denominator, you simply compare
the numerators. The number with the higher numerator is larger.
EXAMPLE: Which fraction is larger, 1
5
2 or 1
8
2?
You know that 8 is larger than 5, so 1
8
2 is larger than 1
5
2.
What if the fractions do not have the same denominator?
One way to answer this type of question is to convert both
fractions so that they have the same denominator. This
is called finding a common denominator. If the two frac-
tions have the same denominator, you can compare their
numerators. 
EXAMPLE: Which fraction is larger, 5
6 or 3
4?
To answer this question, you can raise both fractions to
higher terms with a common denominator. First, you need
to find a denominator that both 6 and 4 can divide into.
You could choose 24 (6 × 4 = 24), or 12. Then raise each
fraction to higher terms with the same denominator.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn how to add and subtract fractions.
How would you add 2 hours and $5? You can’t. You can add and subtract only like objects. You
can add $2 to $5 or 2 hours to 5 hours. It’s the same with fractions. To add and subtract fractions, you
need like fractions. Like fractions are fractions that have the same denominator.
 ADDING AND SUBTRACTING LIKE FRACTIONS
If fractions have the same denominator, you add and subtract their numerators. Then write the sum
or difference over the denominator. 
Example: 1
1
2 + 1
2
2 + 1
1
2
All three of these fractions have the denominator 12. Thus, they are like fractions.
Step 1: Add the numerators together.

 ADDING AND SUBTRACTING UNLIKE FRACTIONS
Fractions that have different denominators are called unlike fractions. Before you can add or subtract
unlike fractions, you ﬁrst need to change the fractions so that they have the same number in the denom-
inator. This process is called ﬁnding a common denominator. 
There are two main ways to ﬁnd a common denominator. One way is to multiply each denomi-
nator by 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on. Then compare the lists of multiples of each denominator. The numbers
that are the same, or that are in common, are common denominators.
Example: Find a common denominator for 1
4
 and 1
6
.
List multiples for each denominator.
Multiples of 4: 4, 8, 12, 16
Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24
The numbers 4 and 6 share the multiple 12. So, 12 is a common denominator for 1
4
 and 1
6
.
Another way to ﬁnd a common denominator is to multiply the denominators together.
Example: Find a common denominator for 1
4
 and 1
6
.
Multiply the denominators together: 4 × 6 = 24. So, 24 is a common denominator for 1
4
 and 1
6
.

Using the smallest common denominator, called the lowest
common denominator, will make your calculations easier. So,
in the case of 1
4 and 1
6, 12 is the lowest common denomina-
tor. Although using 24 as a common denominator will work
just fine for your calculations, your numbers will be larger
and you will have to reduce your final answer to lowest terms.
Follow these steps when adding or subtracting unlike fractions.
Step 1: Find a common denominator.
Step 2: Change each fraction so that it has that common denominator.
Step 3: Add or subtract the fractions as indicated.
Step 4: Reduce your answer to lowest terms.
Example: 1
4
 + 1
6

Step 1: You already know that the lowest common denominator is 12.
Step 2: Raise each fraction to higher terms with the denominator 12.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn how to multiply and divide fractions.
You do not need to ﬁnd a common denominator when multiplying or dividing fractions. In this
sense, multiplying and dividing fractions is easier than adding and subtracting them. If you know how
to multiply, then you basically already know how to multiply and divide fractions.
 MULTIPLYING FRACTIONS
Follow these steps when multiplying fractions.
Step 1: Multiply the numerators. Write the product as the numerator of your answer.
Step 2: Multiply the denominators. Write the product as the denominator of your answer.
Step 3: Reduce your answer to lowest terms.
Example: 2

2 × 1 = 2
So the top number of your answer is 2.
Step 2: Multiply the denominators. Write the product as the denominator of your answer.
3 × 2 = 6
So your fraction is 2

.
Step 3: Reduce your answer to lowest terms.
Both 2 and 6 can be divided by 2:

When a fraction is followed by the word of it means to mul-
tiply.
EXAMPLE: What is 5
8 of 1
2?
The problem is asking you to multiply 5
8 and 1
2.
Step 1: Multiply the numerators. Write the product as the
numerator of your answer.
5 × 1 = 5
So the top number of your answer is 5.
Step 2: Multiply the denominators. Write the product as
the denominator of your answer.
8 × 2 = 16
So your fraction is 1
5
6.
Step 3: The numbers 5 and 16 can both be divided only
by 1. So your answer written in lowest terms is 1
5
6.
Example: Julie bought 3
4
 yard of fabric to make a dress for her baby cousin. She used only 2
3
 of the
piece of fabric. How much of the fabric did she use for the dress?
The problem is asking you to multiply 3

So the top number of your answer is 6.
Step 2: Multiply the denominators. Write the product as the denominator of your answer.
4 × 3 = 12
So your fraction is 1

You can simplify your multiplication by canceling before mul-
tiplying. Like reducing a fraction, canceling involves divid-
ing. If you can see a number that will divide evenly into one
of the numerators and one of the denominators of each frac-
tion you are multiplying, then do so. This is canceling.
EXAMPLE: Let’s look at the last problem again and try to solve
it by canceling:
3
4 × 2
3
There is a 3 in the numerator of the first fraction and in the
denominator of the second fraction. You can cancel by divid-
ing by 3:
3
4
1
 × 3
2
1
You have simplified your problem to 1
4 × 2
1. Do you see a way
to further simplify this problem with canceling? Both 4 and
2 can be divided by 2:
4
1
2 × 2

So now your multiplication is very easy: 1

 DIVIDING FRACTIONS
Dividing fractions is very similar to multiplying fractions. To divide a fraction by another fraction fol-
low these steps.
Step 1: Invert the second fraction. That is, write the numerator on the bottom and the denom-
inator on the top.
Step 2: Multiply the two fractions.
Step 3: Write the answer in lowest terms.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn the difference between a proper frac-
tion and an improper fraction and how to convert an improper
fraction to a mixed number. You will also practice adding, sub-
tracting, multiplying, and dividing when a problem includes an
improper fraction or a mixed number.
So far, the fractions you have been working with in this book have all been proper fractions. A proper
fraction is one in which the numerator is smaller than the denominator. These are examples of proper
fractions: 1
2
, 2
3
, 5
6
, 3
9
4
1, and so on. Proper fractions are always equal to less than 1. They represent a part
of whole.
 WHAT ARE IMPROPER FRACTIONS?
The numerator of an improper fraction is greater than its denominator. Here are some examples of
improper fractions: 4
2
, 2
5
5, 1
4
2, 1
3
0, and so on. Remember that the bar in a fraction means to divide the
top number by the bottom number. Now, look again at the examples of improper fractions.
Let’s try dividing the ﬁrst one: 4

2
 = 2. Now
you try 2

Example: Write a fraction to represent the shaded part of the ﬁgure.
To solve this problem, you ﬁrst count the number of equal parts the circles have been divided into.
Each circle is divided into four wedges of equal size, so the denominator of the fraction is 4. Then count
the number of the parts that are shaded in: 15. So the fraction that is shaded in is 1
4

is an improper fraction because 15 is greater than 4.

 CONVERTING IMPROPER FRACTIONS 
TO WHOLE NUMBERS AND MIXED NUMBERS
Many improper fractions are equal to whole numbers. For example, 4
2
 = 2 and 2
5
5 = 5. But some improper
fractions are not equal to a whole number. They represent a whole number plus a proper fraction. A
whole number plus a proper fraction is called a mixed number. Examples of mixed numbers are 12
3
, 31
2
,
257
8
, and so on.
Improper fractions should usually be converted to whole numbers or mixed numbers when writ-
ing your ﬁnal answer to a problem. Here’s how to convert an improper fraction to a mixed number.
Step 1: Divide the numerator by the denominator.
Step 2: Write the number of times the denominator divides into the numerator as the whole
number part of the mixed number.
Step 3: Write the remainder on top of the improper fraction’s denominator.
Example: Convert 1
3
3 to a mixed number.
Step 1: Divide the numerator by the denominator.

so the mixed number will begin with the whole number 4

 CONVERTING WHOLE NUMBERS 
AND MIXED NUMBERS TO IMPROPER FRACTIONS
When multiplying a whole number or a mixed number with a fraction, you will need to convert the
whole number or mixed number to an improper fraction. You already know how to change a whole
number into an improper fraction: you just write the whole number over 1.
Example: Convert 12 to an improper fraction.
Write the whole number over 1: 1
1
2.
Here’s how to convert a mixed number to an improper fraction.
Step 1: Multiply the whole number part of the mixed number by the denominator of the fraction.
Step 2: Add the numerator of the fraction to the product (the answer to step 1).
Step 3: Write the sum (the answer to step 2) as the numerator in the improper fraction.
Step 4: Keep the same denominator.
Example: Convert 22
3
 to an improper fraction.
Step 1: Multiply the whole number part of the mixed number by the denominator of the fraction.
2 × 3 = 6

Step 2: Add the numerator of the fraction to the product (the answer to step 1).
6 + 2 = 8
Step 3: Write the sum (the answer to step 2) as the numerator in the improper fraction.
So the numerator in the new fraction will be 8.
Step 4: Keep the same denominator.
So the denominator in the new fraction will be 3.
The answer is 8

 ADDING AND SUBTRACTING MIXED NUMBERS
When adding and subtracting mixed numbers, you add the fractions and the whole numbers separately
and then put them together at the end. Follow these steps to add mixed numbers.
Step 1: If the fractions do not have a common denominator, change them into fractions with a
common denominator.
Step 2: Add the numerators of the fractions. Write the sum over the common denominator.
Step 3: Add the whole numbers.

Example: 31

Step 1: If the fractions do not have a common denominator, change them into fractions with a
common denominator.
Both 1
5
 and 3
5
 have a 5 in the denominator, so you do not need to do anything.
Step 2: Add the numerators of the fractions. Write the sum over the common denominator.
1 + 3 = 4, so 4 is the numerator of your new fraction.
The new fraction is 4

Step 5: If your answer includes an improper fraction, convert the improper fraction to a mixed
number and add it to the whole number part of your answer.
Because 4 is less than 5, 4

Step 1: If the fractions do not have a common denominator, change them into fractions with a
common denominator.
Both 4
5
 and 3
4
 have different denominators, so you need to ﬁnd a common denominator. You
might choose to use 20 as a common denominator since both 4 and 5 divide evenly into 20.

3 −2 = 1, so 1 is the numerator of your new fraction.
The new fraction is 1

Step 5: If your answer includes an improper fraction, convert the improper fraction to a mixed
number and add it to the whole number part of your answer. Your answer does not include an
improper fraction, so you can skip this step.
In the last example, the first fraction was larger than the sec-
ond one, so you could simply subtract 1
2 from 3
4. But what if
the first fraction is smaller than the fraction you are sub-
tracting from it? If the numerator of the first fraction is
smaller than the numerator of the second fraction, you will
have to regroup. Here’s how to regroup with fractions.
Step 1: Borrow 1 from the whole number.
Step 2: Write the 1 as a fraction with the same denom-
inator as the fraction.
Step 3: Add the 1 to the fraction. Your answer will be an
improper fraction.
Step 4: Rewrite your subtraction problem. Subtract your
mixed numbers as usual.
EXAMPLE: 51
1
0 −31
8
0 =
You will have to regroup because 1
1
0 is smaller than 1
8
0.
You cannot take 8 away from 1. Follow these steps to
regroup the mixed number 51
1
0.
Step 1: Borrow 1 from the whole number.
Reduce the 5 by 1. So your whole number is now 4.

Step 2: Multiply the numerators. Write the product as the numerator of your answer.
11 × 5 = 55
So the top number of your answer is 55.
Step 3: Multiply the denominators. Write the product as the denominator of your answer.
3 × 2 = 6
So your fraction is 5

THIS SECTION WILL introduce you to the idea of decimals.
You’ll come to understand that a decimal is a special kind of
fraction that you use every day when you deal with measure-
ments or money. You’ll sharpen your skills so you know them
cold! You will learn what decimals are and how to read them.
You’ll compare them, convert them to fractions, and you will also

LESSON SUMMARY
In Section II, you learned how to work with parts of a whole that
are represented by fractions. In this lesson, you will begin work-
ing with decimals—another way of writing parts of a whole. You
will learn what decimals are and how to read them. You will also
learn how to write decimals so they are easy to add and subtract.
If you’ve ever gone shopping, then you are familiar with decimals. We use decimals to represent
amounts of money. Like fractions, decimals represent parts of whole numbers. For example, you know
that $1.50 is neither one whole dollar nor two whole dollars. It’s one dollar and one-half of another
dollar. Another way to write 1.50 is 11

.
 HOW TO READ A DECIMAL
Notice that decimals are numbers written with a dot, or a period, either to the far left or somewhere in
the middle. The dot is called a decimal point. The numbers to the left of the decimal point are whole
numbers. Those to the right of the decimal point are fractions, or parts, of whole numbers.

Although you can always convert a fraction to a decimal by
dividing the numerator by the denominator, it’s a good idea
to know common decimal and fraction equivalents for stan-

You probably already know that each digit in the number 1,234 represents a place value. A place
value is a position in the number. So, for example, the 1 in 1,234 stands for 1 thousand. The 2 stands
for 2 hundreds. The 3 stands for 3 tens. And the 4 stands for 4 ones. These are the place values that
occur to the left of a decimal point. Each digit to the right of a decimal point also has a place value. The
names and positions of several place values are shown below.

When you see a decimal, here’s how to read it.
Step 1: Begin reading from left to right. Read the part of the number that is to the left of the
decimal point as you would any other whole number.
Step 2: Read the decimal point as the word and.
Step 3: Read the number to the right of the decimal point as you would any other number. But
then follow it with the name of the decimal. You can determine the name of the decimal by
counting the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
Example: Write out the following decimal in words: 12.304
Step 1: Begin reading from left to right. Read the part of the number that is to the left of the
decimal point as you would any other whole number. The number to the left of the decimal is 12.
So you would write (or say if you were reading aloud): “twelve.”
Step 2: Read the decimal point as the word and. So you would next write “and.”
Step 3: Read the number to the right of the decimal point as you would any other number. But
then follow it with the name of the decimal. There are three numbers to the right of the decimal
point, so the place value is called thousandths. You would write: “three hundred four thousandths.”
So the decimal 12.304 can be written in the following words: Twelve and three hundred four
thousandths.
Notice that the decimal in the last example has a zero in the
middle: 12.304. This zero happens to be in the hundredths
place. It tells you that there are no hundredths in the num-
ber. However, there are tenths and thousandths, so the zero
serves as a placeholder between the 3 and the 4. When a zero
falls in between two numbers, it serves as a placeholder, and
it affects the value of the number. 
You can also add zeros at the beginning and end of a num-
ber, but they do not affect the value of the number. For exam-
ple, the following numbers are all equal:
0012.304
012.304
12.3040
12.30400

Example: Write the following number as a decimal: forty-three and sixty-seven hundredths.
To write this number as a decimal, you just have to work backwards. It’s helpful to ﬁrst locate the
decimal point by looking for the word and. Then, write the whole number on each side of the
decimal: 43.67. Check your work by making sure that your digits fall in the correct positions. 
What if the number in the last example had been: forty-three
and sixty-seven thousandths? You might have begun by writ-
ing 43.67. But when you counted the digits to the right of
the decimal point, you would have realized that you had writ-
ten sixty-seven hundredths instead of sixty-seven thou-
sandths. You need to add a zero after the decimal point:
43.067. That’s why it’s important to check your work by count-
ing the digits and making sure that the correct place values
are represented in your answer.

 ADDING DECIMALS
Follow these steps when adding decimals. 
Step 1: Write the numbers so that the decimal points are lined up.
Step 2: Make sure that all the decimals have the same number of digits to the right of the deci-
mal point by adding zeros to the end of shorter decimals. 
Step 3: Write the decimal point in the answer so that it lines up with the decimal points in the
problem.
Step 4: Add the decimals just as you would if you were adding whole numbers.
The position of the decimal point in a number makes a big
difference in its value. Always line up the decimal points
before adding or subtracting decimals. This will help you put
the decimal point in the correct place and get the correct
answer.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn how to multiply and divide decimals.
If you can multiply and divide whole numbers, then you can multiply and divide decimals. The main
thing to watch out for is the placement of the decimal point. Placing the decimal point in your answer
is just a matter of counting place values.
 MULTIPLYING DECIMALS
When you multiply decimals, you begin as if you were working with whole numbers. Then, you come
back to the decimal point. When multiplying decimals, follow these steps.
Step 1: Multiply the numbers as if you were working with whole numbers. You can ignore the
decimal points for now.
Step 2: Now count the number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point—in each
number you are multiplying.

Step 3: Beginning with the digit farthest to the right in your answer, count out the number of
decimal places you found in Step 2. Then, write the decimal point to the left of the last digit
counted. You should end up with the same number of decimal places in your answer as the sum
of decimal places in the numbers you multiplied together.
You don’t need to line up the decimal points when multiplying
decimals. In fact, you can pretend as if the decimals aren’t
even there until after you have completed the multiplication.
After multiplying the numbers together, then worry about the
decimal point. Remember, the number of decimal places in
your answer should equal the sum of the decimal places in the
numbers with which you began multiplying.
EXAMPLE: How many decimal places will the answer to this
problem have?
2.8975 × 1.0104
First, count the number of decimal places in each number
given. The first number 2.8975 has four decimal places. The
second number 1.0104 also has four decimal places. Then,
add these two numbers together: 4 + 4 = 8. So, your answer
should have eight decimal places. 
Let’s say you punch 2.8975 × 1.0104 into your calculator.
Your calculator might give you the answer: 2.927634. Wait
a minute! There aren’t eight decimal places to the right of
the decimal. There are only six. So, is your calculator wrong?
No, it’s not. If you multiply out the answer by hand, you’ll
see that the last two digits are zeros.
2.8975
x 1.0104
    
 115900

As you know, zeros at the end of the decimal do not
change its value. Your calculator omitted these zeros in its
answer. And you can, too, when you write your final answer.
Example: 0.5 × 0.5
Step 1: Multiply the numbers.
5 × 5 = 25
Step 2: Count the number of decimal places to the right of the decimal point—in each number you
are multiplying. Both numbers have one decimal place to the right of decimal point: 1 + 1 = 2.
Step 3: Beginning with the digit farthest to the right in your answer, count out the number of
decimal places you found in step 2. That’s 2 for this problem. Then, write the decimal point to
the left of the last digit counted: 0.25
The answer is 0.25.
When multiplying by a multiple of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000,
and so on, you just have to move the decimal point to the right. 
EXAMPLE: 10 × 0.5
Step 1: Count the number of zeros in the multiple of 10.
The number 10 has only one zero.
Step 2: Move the decimal point in the decimal you are
multiplying to the right the number of zeros you counted
in Step 1. You counted one zero in step one, so you move
the decimal point over one place in 0.5. 
The answer is 5.
EXAMPLE: 100  0.5
Step 1: Count the number of zeros in the multiple of 10.
The number 100 has two zeros.

Step 2: Move the decimal point in the decimal you are
multiplying to the right the number of zeros you counted
in Step 1. You counted two zeros in step one, so you move
the decimal point over two places in 0.5. 
But there aren’t two places to move the decimal point
in 0.5, so you add zeros to the right of the 5.
The answer is 50.

 DIVIDING DECIMALS BY WHOLE NUMBERS
Dividing decimals by whole numbers is very similar to dividing whole numbers by whole numbers. The
main trick is to set the problem up correctly, so you put the decimal in the correct position. Follow
these steps when dividing a decimal by a whole number.
Step 1: Write the decimal point in the answer portion of the division problem. It should go just
above the decimal point in the problem.
Step 2: Divide as if you were dividing whole numbers. Ignore the decimal point for the
moment.
Example: 4.9 ÷ 7
Step 1: Write the decimal point in the answer portion of the division problem. It should go just
above the decimal point in the problem.
Step 2: Divide as if you were dividing whole numbers.
0.7
74.9

   4 9
The answer is 0.7.
When dividing by a multiple of 10, such as 10, 100, 1,000,
and so on, you just have to move the decimal point to the left. 
EXAMPLE: 0.5 ÷ 10
Step 1: Count the number of zeros in the multiple of 10:
10 has only one zero.
Step 2: You counted one zero in step one, so you move
the decimal point one place to the left: 0.5 
Therefore, the answer is 0.05.

 DIVIDING BY DECIMALS
Some problems will require you to divide by a decimal. When the number you are dividing by is a deci-
mal, you should ﬁrst change it to a whole number. Here’s how it works.
Step 1: Make the divisor—the number you are dividing by—a whole number. You do this by
moving the decimal point to the right of the number in the ones place.
Step 2: Move the decimal point in the dividend—the number you are dividing into—the same
number of places to the right as you did for the divisor.
Step 3: Divide as usual.

Step 1: Make the divisor a whole number. 
Step 2: Move the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places to the right.
Step 3: Divide as usual.
The answer is 50.5.
What if you are dividing a decimal into a whole number and
there aren’t enough decimal places to move the decimal to the
right? You would follow the same steps, but you would add
zeros on to the end of the whole number, so you could move
the decimal point the correct number of places to the right.
Example: 0.0315
Step 1: Make the divisor a whole number. 
Step 2: Move the decimal point in the dividend the same
number of places to the right. To do this, you will first
have to add the decimal point to the whole number.

of a whole number. Then, add zeros after the decimal
point. Now you can move the decimal point over.
Step 3: Divide as usual.
The answer is 500.
Remember that adding zeros to the right of a decimal does
not change its value. So anytime you need to move a deci-
mal point more places to the right, just add zeros.

Amounts of money are represented to the hundredths place.
For example, we write one and one-half dollars as $1.50, not
as 1.5. When you use a calculator to work with amounts of
money, remember to write your final answer to the hundredths
place. This means two things:
■You should add a zero to a decimal that goes only to
the tenths place. So you would write $1.2 as $1.20.
■You should round decimals that go beyond the hun-
dredths place to the nearest hundredths place. So you
would write $1.278 as $1.28.

1. Begin by multiplying the numbers together: 15 × 10 = 150. Now you have to insert the deci-
mal point in the correct place. Count the number of places to the right of the decimal point in
each number you are multiplying. You have a total of one decimal place (1 place in 1.5 and none
in 10), so you move the decimal place one place to the left, and your answer is 15.

Percentages
NOW THAT YOU know all about decimals, it’s time to learn
about percentages. Percents are just hundredths. We’ve already
seen hundredths when we addressed fractions and decimals. In
this section, we will review how to express given percentages
as both fractions and decimals. You’ll find that you come into
contact with percentages every day with grades, sales tax, tips,
and discounts.

Percents,
Decimals,
and Fractions
LESSON SUMMARY
So far in this book, you’ve learned how to work with parts of a
whole that are represented by fractions and decimals. In this les-
son, you will begin working with another way of writing parts of
a whole—percents. You will learn what percents are and how to
convert them to decimals and fractions. You will also learn how
to convert decimals and fractions to percents.
Percents are everywhere you look. Go to the mall, and you’ll see plenty of signs announcing “20%
off” or “Take an additional 30% off.” Packages at the supermarket regularly claim to include “30%
more free.” Even your grades at school are probably percents!
 WHAT ARE PERCENTS?
Like fractions and decimals, percent is another way to represent the parts of a whole. Notice that per-
cents are written with the percent sign after a number: 10%, 25%, 30%, 50%, 99%, and so on. The
percent sign represents the words “out of 100 parts” or “per 100 parts.”

Recall that fractions represent the parts of a whole that is
divided into any number of equal parts. So, you can find frac-
tions with any whole number in the denominator: 1
2, 2
3, 4
5, 1
6
0,

2
1
1
5
2
, and so on. Decimals represent the parts of a whole that
is divided into either 10, 100, 1,000, or another multiple of
10 equal parts. Percents, on the other hand, always represent
a whole that is divided into 100 equal parts. That means that
percents can be written as fractions with 100 in the denom-
inator and decimals written to the hundredths place.
 CONVERTING PERCENTS TO DECIMALS
Changing percents to decimals is as simple as moving the decimal point two digits to the left. Here are
the basic steps.
Step 1: Drop the percent sign.
Step 2: Add a decimal point if there isn’t already one. Remember that even when it’s not writ-
ten in, whole numbers are followed by a decimal point.
Step 3: Move the decimal point two places to the left.
Example: Convert 25% to a decimal.
Step 1: Drop the percent sign.
So 25% becomes 25.
Step 2: Add a decimal point.
25.
Step 3: Move the decimal point two places to the left.
0.25
So 25% = 0.25
Example: Convert 22.5% to a decimal.
Step 1: Drop the percent sign.
22.5
Step 2: There is already a decimal point in place, so you can skip this step.

 CONVERTING DECIMALS TO PERCENTS
Changing decimals to percents is the opposite of what you’ve just done. When you change a decimal
to a percent, you move the decimal point two digits to the right. Here are the basic steps.
Step 1: Move the decimal point two places to the right. If there aren’t enough digits to move
the decimal point over two places, add zeros.
Step 2: Add a percent sign after the number.
Example: Convert 0.15 to a percent.
Step 1: Move the decimal point two places to the right.
So 0.15 becomes 15.
Step 2: Add a percent sign after the number.
15%
Thus, 0.15 = 15%.

 CONVERTING PERCENTS TO FRACTIONS
To change a percent to a fraction, you write the percent over 100. Don’t forget to reduce the fraction
to lowest terms as you would any other fraction. Here are the steps to follow.
Step 1: Drop the percent sign.
Step 2: Write the number as a fraction over 100.
Step 3: Write improper fractions as mixed numbers. Reduce the fraction to lowest terms.
Example: Convert 15% to a fraction.
Step 1: Drop the percent sign.
15% becomes 15.

There are two basic ways to convert fractions to percents. You should try both ways, and see which one
works best for you.
Method 1
Step 1: Divide the numerator by the denominator.
Step 2: Multiply by 100. (This is the same as moving the decimal point two digits to the right.)

Although you can always convert between percents, decimals,
and fractions using the described methods, it’s a good idea
to know common percent, decimal, and fraction equivalents
for standardized tests. Knowing them in advance can save you
valuable time on a timed test. Besides, working with a value
in one form is often easier than working with it in another
form. Knowing the equivalents can help you see the easier
route faster. Here are some common equivalents you might
want to learn.

Solving 
Percent 
Problems
LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will use percents to solve math problems. You
will learn about three basic kinds of percent problems and how to
solve them.
Percent problems ask you to ﬁnd one of three things: the part, the whole, or the percent. Here’s
how these three elements are related to one another.
Whole × Percent = Part
This is called an equation, or a kind of math sentence. It tells how different elements are related
to one another. You can use this equation to ﬁnd any one of the elements that might be missing. 
It’s often easier to multiply a percent if you first convert it
to a decimal.
EXAMPLE: 10% × 12
Convert 10% to a decimal: .10, or 0.1
Then, multiply: 0.1 × 12 = 1.2

 FINDING A PART OF A WHOLE
Often you will be asked to ﬁnd a part of a whole. In these problems, you are given a whole and a per-
cent, and are asked to ﬁnd the part represented by the percent of the whole. Let’s go through some
examples.
Example: What is 30% of 60?
Step 1: Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
You have the percent: 30%.
You have the whole: 60.
You are looking for the part.
Step 2: Then, use the equation to solve the problem: Whole Percent = Part
Plug in the pieces of the equation that you know: 60 × 30% = Part
Step 3: Convert the percent to a decimal to make your multiplication easier: 60 × 0.30 = Part
Step 4: Solve: 60 × 0.30 = 18.
So, 30% of 60 is 18.
Example: Only 10% of Mrs. Cunningham’s class got an A on the last test. There are 20 students in
the class. How many students got an A on the last test?
Step 1: Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
You have the percent: 10%.
You have the whole: 20 students.
You are looking for the part—the part of the class that got an A on the last test.
Step 2: Then, use the equation to solve the problem: Whole × Percent = Part
Plug in the pieces of the equation that you know: 20 × 10% = Part
Step 3: Convert the percent to a decimal to make your multiplication easier: 20 × 0.10 = Part
Step 4: Solve: 20 × 0.10 = 2.
So, two students received an A on Mrs. Cunningham’s last test.

class. How many students got a B in Mr. Hopkin’s class last year?
10. Lan’s class sold candy bars to raise money for the school French Club. Lan sold 40% of the 500
candy bars that were sold. How many candy bars did Lan sell?
 FINDING A PERCENT
In the following types of problems, you will be given the part and the whole. Your task is to determine
what percent the part is of the whole. Remember that a percent is just a fraction written over 100. You
can solve these types of problems by writing the part over the whole and converting the fraction to a
percent.
Example: 10 is what percent of 200?
Step 1: Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
You have the part: 10.
You have the whole: 200.
You are looking for the percent.
Step 2: Write a fraction of the part over the whole.
2

Step 3: Convert the fraction to a percent. Remember there are two methods for converting frac-
tions to percents. Use either method. Method 1 is shown below.
10 ÷ 200 = 0.05
0.05 × 100 = 5
5%
So, 10 is 5% of 200.

Let’s look at the equation from earlier in the lesson again.
Whole × Percent = Part
If you have already learned some algebra, you know that the
elements in an equation can be rearranged in order to solve
for one element in the equation. Thus, another way to
approach this type of problem is to go back to the original
equation and rearrange the elements, so that the equation
is set to solve for the percent. In this case, the equation would
look like this:
Percent = 
W
P
h
a
o
rt
le

Notice that when you set up a fraction with the part over the
whole, you are really just solving this equation.
Example: There are 500 people in Sandra’s 8th grade class. Fifty people in her class were chosen to
go to Washington, DC, for a ﬁeld trip. What percent of Sandra’s class was chosen to go on the ﬁeld
trip?
Step 1: Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
You have the part: 50.
You have the whole: 500.
You are looking for the percent.
Step 2: Write a fraction of the part over the whole.

Step 3: Convert the fraction to a percent. Remember there are two methods for converting frac-
tions to percents. Use either method. Method 1 is shown below.
50 ÷ 500 = 0.1
0.1 × 100 = 10
10%
So, 10% of Sandra’s class was chosen to go on the ﬁeld trip.

Sometimes, this type of problem will ask you to find a per-
cent change. The problem will give you one part of the
whole. Your task is to calculate the part of the whole repre-
sented by the difference between the whole and the part given.
EXAMPLE: Last year, Sasha could run one mile in 10 minutes.
This year, he can run a mile in 8 minutes. By what percent
did his timing improve?
Step 1: Begin by figuring out what you know from the
problem and what you’re looking for.
You have the part: 10 minutes −8 minutes = 2 min-
utes
You also have the whole: 10 minutes.
You are looking for the percent.
Step 2: Write a fraction of the part over the whole.

So, Sasha’s running time improved by 20% since last year.
When you see these types of phrases, you are probably
being asked to calculate the part of the whole represented
by the difference between the whole and the part given.

20. Kim’s average in History class went down from 100 to 95. By what percent did his average go
down?
Sometimes the problem will not directly tell you the whole
amount. Instead, you will be given enough information to cal-
culate the whole on your own. Here’s an example.
EXAMPLE: Priyanka made a beaded bracelet using 10 red
beads, 5 turquoise beads, 8 yellow beads, and 2 white beads.
What percent of the bracelet do the red beads make up?
Step 1: Begin by figuring out what you know from the

multiply, multiply the numerator (or top number) of the first
fraction by the denominator (or bottom number) of the sec-
ond fraction and the denominator of the first fraction by the
numerator of the second fraction. The result will look like this:

2. Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
 You have the percent: 90%.
 You have the whole: $800.
 You are looking for the part.
Part = $800 × 0.90 = $720—this is the part that the insurance company will pay. The question
asks for the part that Estrella has to pay: $800 −($800 × 0.90) = $80. The answer is $80.
Another way to look at the problem: If the insurance com-
pany will pay 90%, then Estrella has to pay 10% (100% −
90% = 10%). Estrella has to pay $80 ($800 × 0.10 = $80).

So, there are 25 students in the class.
8. Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.
 You have the percent: 4.5%.
 You have the whole: $26,000.
 You are looking for the part: Part = $26,000 × 0.045 = $1,170.
But the question asks for the amount she will make with this raise, so you have to add the part
to her salary: $1,170 + $26,000 = $27,170.
So she will earn $27,170.
Another way to look at the problem: Special Agent Tate will
earn $26,000 × 0.045 + $26,000 = $27,170.

 You have the percent: 35%.
 You have the whole: $12.20.
 You are looking for the part: Part = $12.20 × 0.35 = $4.27. This is the amount of mark-up
the merchant will add to the price of the product.
You have to add the part to the price: $4.27 + $12.20 = $16.47. So the selling price will be $16.47.
Another way to look at the problem: The selling price is
$16.47 ($12.20 × 0.035 + $12.20).
11. Begin by ﬁguring out what you know from the problem and what you’re looking for.

 You have the whole: $13,000.
 You are looking for the part: Part = $13,000 × 0.20 = $2,600. This is the amount of proﬁt
the car dealer wants to make.
You have to add the part to the price: $2,600 + $13,000 = $15,600. So the selling price will be
$15,600.
Another way to look at the problem: He should sell the car
for $13,000 × 0.20 + $13,000 = $15,600.

Statistics
STATISTICS ARE EVERYWHERE—in news reports, sports,
and on your favorite websites. Mean, median, and mode are three
common statistics that give information on a group of numbers.
They are called measures of central tendency because they are
different ways of finding the central trend in a group of
numbers. Ratios and proportions are ways to compare these sta-
tistics.
Similarly, you see probabilities or predictions all the time.
Listening to the weather report, you may hear that there is a
60% chance of rain tomorrow. At karate lessons, you may hear
that 19 out of 20 advanced students will attain a brown belt.
On television, you might hear that four out of five dentists rec-
ommend a certain toothbrush. These are all ways to express prob-
ability. In this section, you will also learn what probability is
and how to calculate it.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn how to find the mean, median, and
mode of a set of numbers.
Statistics are everywhere. In news reports, at the doctor’s ofﬁce, even in class at school—we get
information in the form of statistics every day. Mean, median, and mode are three common statistics
that give information on of a group of numbers. In fact, they are called measures of central tendency because
they are different ways of ﬁnding the central trend of a group of numbers.
 FINDING THE MEAN
Mean is just another word for average. The mean, or average, is one of the most useful and common
statistics. You probably already average your grades at school regularly, so you may already know the
basic steps to ﬁnding the mean of a set of numbers. 
Step 1: Add all the numbers in the list.
Step 2: Count the number of numbers in the list.
Step 3: Divide the sum (the result of Step 1) by the number (the result of Step 2).

Another way to think about the mean is in the form of this equation:
Mean = 
Example: Find the mean of the following set of numbers: 5, 7, 19, 12, 4, 11, 15.
Step 1: Add all the numbers in the list.
5 + 7 + 19 + 12 + 4 + 11 + 15 = 73
Step 2: Count the number of numbers in the list.
There are seven numbers in the list.
Step 3: Divide the sum (the result of Step 1) by the number (the result of Step 2).
7

3 = 10.4
So, the mean is 10.4.
Example: Jason has four grades of equal weight in history. They are 82, 90, 88, and 85. What is Jason’s
mean (average) in history?
Step 1: Add all the numbers in the list.
82 + 90 + 88 + 85 = 345
Step 2: Count the number of numbers in the list.
There are four numbers in the list.
Step 3: Divide the sum (the result of Step 1) by the number (the result of Step 2).

So, the mean is 86.25.

10. Philip saves a portion of his allowance each week. Last month, he saved $5, $7, $2, and $9. On
average, how much did Philip save per week last month?
 FINDING THE MEDIAN
The median is the middle number in a group of numbers arranged in sequential order. In a set of num-
bers, half will be greater than the median and half will be less than the median.
Step 1: Put the numbers in sequential order.
Step 2: The middle number is the median.
Example: Find the median of the following set of numbers: 5, 7, 19, 12, 4, 11, 15.
Step 1: Put the numbers in sequential order.
4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 15, 19
Step 2: The middle number is the median.
The middle number is 11.
So, 11 is the median.

In the last example, there was an odd number of numbers,
so the middle number was easy to find. But what if you are
given an even number of numbers? Let’s see how it works.
EXAMPLE: Find the median of the following set of numbers:
5, 7, 19, 12, 4, 11, 15, 13.
Step 1: Put the numbers in sequential order.
4, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 19
Step 2: The middle number is the median.
But there are two middle numbers: 11 and 12. In this case,
you find the mean (or average) of the two middle numbers.
That value is your median. Remember, to find the mean of a
set of numbers, you first add the numbers together (11 + 12
= 23). Then, you divide the sum by the number of numbers
(23 ÷ 2 = 11.5).
So, 11.5 is the median.

19. Jill scored the following points in her last ﬁve volleyball games: 3, 5, 2, 6, 1. What is the median
of her point totals?
20. Jack has three grades in Math. They are 82, 81, and 84. What is the median of his grades in Math?
Why would you use the median instead of the mean? Let’s
say your teacher gives everyone above the class mean either
an A or B. Here are the grades on the last test.
The class mean is 71, so only six students will receive an
A or a B on the last test. All the other students will get a C
or below. How would the result be different if the teacher
used the class median to determine who gets an A and who
gets a B? In that case, everyone with a test score greater than
a 69 would get either an A or a B on the test—that’s eight
students. About half the students would get an A or a B using
the median.
Notice that the mean was raised by the one person who
received a 110 on the test. Often, when one number changes
the mean to be higher than the center value, the median can
be used instead.

 FINDING THE MODE
The mode refers to the number in a set of numbers that occurs most frequently. To ﬁnd the mode, you
just look for numbers that occur more than once and ﬁnd the one that appears most often.
Example: Find the mode of the following set of numbers: 5, 7, 9, 12, 9, 11, 15.
The number 9 occurs twice in the list, so 9 is the mode.
Example: Find the mode of the following set of numbers: 5, 7, 19, 12, 4, 11, 15.
None of the numbers occurs more than once, so there is no mode.
Example: Find the mode of the following set of numbers: 5, 7, 9, 12, 9, 11, 5.
The numbers 5 and 9 both occur twice in the list, so both 5 and 9 are modes. When a set of numbers
has two modes, it is called bimodal.
As you can see, the mode isn’t always a middle number in a set of numbers. Instead, mode shows
clustering. Mode is often used in stores to decide which sizes, styles, or prices are most popular. It wouldn’t
make sense for a clothing store to stock up on the mean size or the median size of pants. It makes more
sense to buy the sizes that most people wear. And how would a store ﬁnd the mean or the median of
different styles of clothes? It can’t. There’s where the mode comes in.

Using Ratios

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn what ratios and proportions are. You
will also learn how to write ratios and proportions and how to work
with them in basic calculations, including those used in mea-
surement conversions.
Ratios and proportions are often found in textbooks and news reports. You’ll also ﬁnd them in
math word problems.
 WHAT ARE RATIOS?
A ratio is a way of comparing two or more numbers. There are several different ways to write ratios.
Here are some examples of ways to write ratios.
 with the word to: 1 to 2
 using a colon (:) to separate the numbers: 1 : 2
 using the term for every: 1 for every 2
 separated by a division sign or fraction bar: 1

Example: Write the following ratio as a fraction: ﬁve girls to six boys.
The question asks you to write the ratio as a fraction: 5
6
.
Keep the terms of a ratio in the order that the problem com-
pares them. Since the last example compared girls to boys,
your answer should give the number of girls to the number
of boys.
Example: Write the following ratio using a colon: 10 wins to 5 losses.
10:5
Example: Write the following ratio as a fraction: 10 wins to 5 losses.
1
5
0
Ratios often look like fractions and they can be reduced to
lowest terms just as fractions can be. However, do not change
a ratio whose numerator is larger than its denominator to a
whole number or a mixed number. A ratio that looks like a
fraction is comparing the two numbers. You will lose the com-
parison if you treat the ratio as a fraction and convert it to
a mixed number. Let’s look again at the last example.
EXAMPLE: Write the following ratio as a fraction: 10 wins to
5 losses.
1
5
0
Even though 1
5
0 looks like an improper fraction, it’s not
here—it’s a ratio comparing the number of wins to the
number of losses. You can however, reduce the ratio to
lowest terms: 1
5
0 = 2
1.

 SOLVING RATIO PROBLEMS
There are several kinds of ratio problems. The examples below show how to solve different kinds of
ratio problems.
Example: A painter mixes two quarts of red paint to three quarts of white paint. What is the ratio of
red paint to white paint?
There are several ways you could write this ratio:
2 quarts of red paint to 3 quarts of white paint, or 2 to 3
2 quarts red paint: 3 quarts white paint, or 2:3
, or 2

a. The ﬁrst part of the question asks for the ratio of games won to games lost. So, you would
write 3

.
b. The second part of the question asks for the ratio of games won to games played. First, you
need to calculate the total number of games played. Since the Tigers won 30 games, lost 6
games and tied no games, they must have played a total of 36 games. The ratio of games won
to games played is
, or 3

You could reduce 3

Often, ratios are written to look like fractions. For example,
2:3 can be written as 2
3; 7 to 8 can be written as 7
8; and so
on. In Section 2, you learned that fractions are ways of rep-
resenting a part of a whole. Usually, a fraction represents a
part over a whole:

Often, a ratio represents a part over a part:

When a ratio represents a part over a part, you can often find
the whole if you know all the parts. In the last example, you
did know all the parts, so you were able to calculate the total
number of games played last season—the whole. Let’s look
at another example.
EXAMPLE: Assume that there are 15 boys and 20 girls in your
math class. What is the ratio of boys to girls in your math
class?
You can write the ratio 15:20. You could also write it as

EXAMPLE: Assume that there are 15 boys and 20 girls in your
math class. What is the fraction of girls in your math class?
To write the fraction of girls in your math class, you have
to calculate the total number of students in the class.
There are 15 boys and 20 girls in your class, so there are
35 students in your class. That is, the whole is the total
number of students in math class (35). There are 20 girls
in your math class. So, the fraction of girls in math class
is 2

7. This fraction represents a part
over a whole.
Example: At the Pumpkin Festival last night there were 4 men, 8 women, and 20 children. What is
the ratio of men to women to children? Use colons to write your answer.
The ratio is 4:8:20. You could reduce this ratio (by dividing all the numbers by 4) to 1:2:5. This
problem asks you to compare more than two numbers, so a fraction cannot be used.
Example: At the Pumpkin Festival last night there were 4 men, 8 women, and 20 children. What is
the ratio of children to total people attending the festival? Use colons to write your answer.
First, calculate the total number of people at the Pumpkin Festival: 4 + 8 + 20 = 32. There were
20 children at the festival, so you would write 20:32. You can reduce this ratio (by dividing each
number by 4) to 5:8.
Example: At the Pumpkin Festival last night there were 4 men, 8 women, and 20 children. What is

Look at the answers to the last four example problems. Notice
that the numbers are all in different orders and represent dif-
ferent things. In some cases, they represent men, women, chil-
dren, and the total number of people at the festival. That’s
why it’s often helpful to write the words that go with the num-
bers. This can help you keep the meaning of each ratio in
mind. You may not be able to use the labels in your answer
when you are working on a multiple-choice test, but you can
use the labels as you work through the problem on your own.
Let’s quickly go through the last four examples again, this
time using the labels in the answers.
EXAMPLE: At the Pumpkin Festival last night there were 4 men,
8 women, and 20 children. What is the ratio of men to women
to children? Use colons to write your answer.
The ratio is 4 men:8 women:20 children. You could
reduce this ratio (by dividing all the numbers by 4) to
1 man:2 women:5 children. Now it’s clear what each num-
ber refers to. There was one man to every four women
and every five children.
EXAMPLE: At the Pumpkin Festival last night there were 4 men,
8 women, and 20 children. What is the ratio of children to
total people attending the festival? Use colons to write your
answer.
Fist, calculate the total number of people at the Pump-
kin Festival: 4 + 8 + 20 = 32. There were 20 children at
the festival, so you would write 20 children:32 total peo-
ple. You can reduce this ratio (by dividing each number
by 4) to 5 children:8 total people. There were five chil-
dren out of every eight people at the festival.

Use colons to write your answer.
There were 8 women and 4 men, so you would write 8
women:4 men. You can reduce this ratio (by dividing each
number by 4) to 2 women:1 man. There were two women
for every man at the festival.
EXAMPLE: At the Pumpkin Festival last night there were 4 men,
8 women, and 20 children. What is the ratio of children to
adults? Use colons to write your answer.
First, calculate the number of adults present. There were
8 women and 4 men, so there were 12 adults. There were
20 children, so you would write 20 children:12 adults.
You can reduce this ratio (by dividing each number by
4) to 5 children:3 adults. There were five children for
every three adults at the festival.
In word problems, the terms per, for every, and in (a) can also
indicate that a ratio is being used. For example, you might
see that Jacques drove 30 miles per gallon of gas. When you
see the per, you can write the ratio as follows:

Notice that ratios written using the word per are almost always
fractions over the number 1. These ratios are sometimes called
unit rates because they are written in terms of one unit.
Example: If a driver drives 100 miles in two hours, what is his average speed?
You can answer this question by setting up a ratio: 100 miles:2 hours. You can reduce this ratio
(by dividing by 2) to 50 miles:1 hour. So, the driver drove on average 50 miles per hour.

 WHAT ARE PROPORTIONS?
A proportion is a way of relating two ratios to one another. Let’s say you read in your school newspaper
that 8 out of 10 students at your school are expected to take the PSAT this year. If there are 100 stu-
dents in your school, then 80 students are expected to take the test this year. This is an example of a
proportion. Proportions can be written as equations. For example, this proportion can be written as
follows:
1
8
0 = 1
8
0
0
0

Proportions show equivalent fractions. Both 1
8
0 and 1
8
0
0
0
 reduce to the same fraction: 4
5
.
For a proportion to work, the terms in both ratios have to be
written in the same order. Notice that the numerator in each
ratio in the proportion above refers to the number of students
expected to take the exam. The denominator refers to the total
number of students.
Let’s say you didn’t see immediately that 1
8
0 would be equal to 1
8
0
0
0
. How could you have ﬁgured
out the equivalent ratio? Remember in Section 2 when you were working with fractions? You learned
the following steps to raising a fraction to higher terms.
Step 1:
Divide the denominator of the fraction into the new denominator.
Step 2:
Multiply the quotient, or the answer to Step 1, by the numerator.
Step 3:
Write the product, or the answer to Step 2, over the new denominator.

Let’s use these steps to solve for the missing term in the proportion.
Example: 1
8
0 = 10
?
0

Step 1: Divide the denominator into the new denominator. The new denominator is 100.
100 ÷ 10 = 10
Step 2: Multiply the answer to Step 1 by the numerator.
8 × 10 = 80
Step 3: Write the answer to Step 2 over the new denominator.
1
8
0
0
0

There’s another way to solve for the missing term. It’s called cross multiplying or ﬁnding the cross
products. Here’s how cross multiplying works.
Step 1: Multiply the numerator of the ﬁrst ratio by the denominator in the second ratio.
Step 2: Divide the product (the answer to Step 1) by the denominator in the ﬁrst ratio. Write
the answer over the denominator in the second ratio.
Let’s look at the example above again and solve using cross multiplication.
Example: 1
8
0 = 10
?
0

Step 1: Multiply the numerator of the ﬁrst ratio by the denominator in the second ratio.
8 × 100 = 800
Step 2: Divide the product (the answer to Step 1) by the denominator in the ﬁrst ratio. Write the
answer over the denominator in the second ratio.
800 ÷ 10 = 80
So, the second ratio is 1
8
0
0
0
.
You can also use cross multiplication to check that two
ratios are equal. When a proportion is set up properly, the
results of cross multiplication should be equal. Here’s how
it works.
EXAMPLE: Use cross multiplication to check that the two ratios
in this proportion are equal:
1

0 = 

Step 1: Multiply the numerator of the first ratio by the
denominator in the second ratio.
8 × 100 = 800
Step 2: Multiply the denominator of the first ratio by the
numerator in the second ratio.
10 × 80 = 800
Step 3: Set the answer to Step 1 equal to the answer to
Step 2. If they are equal, your proportion is valid.
800 = 800
Use cross multiplication to check your proportions as you
work.

 SOLVING PROPORTION WORD PROBLEMS
Proportions are common in word problems. Let’s look at some examples of proportion word problems.
Example: Margaret drove 220 miles in ﬁve hours. If she maintained the same speed, how far could
she drive in seven hours?
Step 1: Set up a proportion.
= 
Step 2: Solve for the missing number in the second ratio:
220 × 7 ÷ 5 = 308
Step 3: Check your work by cross multiplying:
220 × 7 = 5 × 308
1540 = 1540
Keeping the same speed, Margaret could drive 308 miles in seven hours.
Example: Harry earns $6 per hour at his job. If he works nine hours this week, how much will Harry
earn?
Step 1: Set up a proportion.
= 
Step 2: Solve for the missing number in the second ratio:
6 × 9 ÷ 1 = $54
Step 3: Check your work by cross multiplying:
6 × 9 = 54 × 1
54 = 54
Working seven hours, Harry will make $54.
Example: There are 2.2 pounds in a kilogram. If a baby is born weighing 7.5 pounds, how many kilo-
grams does the baby weigh?
Step 1: Set up a proportion.
= 
Step 2: Solve for the missing number in the second ratio:
1 × 7.5 ÷ 2.2 = 3.4 (We rounded the answer to the nearest tenth of a kilogram so that our
numbers were all parallel—accurate to the nearest tenth.)

Use proportions to convert from one unit of measure to
another. Conversion factors are ratios used to convert from
one unit of measure to another. When you know the conver-
sion factor, you can set up a proportion.
The units of the International System of Units, commonly
referred to as SI units, are used in most countries of the world
as well as by almost all scientists around the world. Some-
times SI units are called metrics. You know some of these
units as centimeters, kilograms, and milliliters. Notice that
many SI units have a prefix. The following table relates some
SI prefixes to their meanings. You can use this table to con-
vert between SI units.

You can use the information in this table to convert kilome-

a unit with the prefix kilo- (kilometer) is 1,000 larger than
a unit with no prefix (meter), so 1 kilometer = 1,000 meters.
Now try it with centimeters.

tors used to convert between the SI and conventional systems

Probability
LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn what probability is and how to cal-
culate it. You will also practice writing probabilities as fractions,
decimals, and percents.
We hear probabilities all the time. Listening to the weather report, you might hear that there is
a 60% chance of rain tomorrow. At school, you might hear that 19 of 20 students will pass math this
year. On TV, you might hear that 4
5
 of dentists recommend a certain brand of toothpaste. These are
all ways of expressing probabilities.
 WHAT IS PROBABILITY?
Probability is the mathematics of chance. It is a way of calculating how likely it is that something will
happen. It is expressed as the following ratio:
P (event) = Number of favorable outcomes

Number of total outcomes

The term favorable outcomes refers to the events you want to occur. Total outcomes refers to all the
possible events that could occur.
A probability of zero (0) means that the event cannot occur. A probability of 50% is said to be
random or chance. A probability of 100% or 1.00 is certain to occur.
Probabilities can be written in different ways:
 As a ratio: 1 out of 2 (1:2)
 As a fraction: 1
2

 As a percent: 50%
 As a decimal 0.5
Let’s look at some example problems.
Example: Aili has four tickets to the School Carnival Rafﬂe. If 150 were sold, what is the probabil-
ity that one of Aili’s tickets will be drawn?
Step 1: Plug the numbers into the probability equation.
P (event) = 
P (winning ticket) = 1

50

Step 2: Solve the equation.
There are several ways to write your answer. Here are two: You can write the answer as a
fraction 1
4
50
, which reduces to 7
2
5. Or, as a percent: 2.7% (we rounded this answer up from
2.66666 . . . .).
Example: What is the probability of getting heads with a single coin toss?
Step 1: Plug the numbers into the probability equation.
P (event) = 
There are two possible outcomes: heads or tails, so you create the following equation:
P (heads) = 1
2

Step 2: Solve the equation.
The probability of getting heads is 1
2
, or you have a 50% chance of getting heads.
Example: A sack holds three purple buttons, two orange buttons, and ﬁve green buttons. What is the
probability of drawing a purple button out of the sack?
Step 1: Plug the numbers into the probability equation.
P (event) = 
There are 10 buttons (3 + 2 + 5 = 10) in the sack.

 MORE PROBABILITY PROBLEMS
So far in this lesson, you’ve worked with situations that deal with only one event. Now let’s look at
problems that involve more than one event.
Independent Events
Sometimes, the events are independent. That is, the ﬁrst event does not affect the probability of events
that come after it. Here’s an example.
Example: You toss a penny and a dime into the air. What is the probability that both coins will land
heads up?
You could list all the possible outcomes in a table like this:
PENNY
DIME
Heads
Heads
Heads
Tails
Tails
Heads
Tails
Tails
Then, you could use this information to ﬁll in the probability equation:
P (event) = 
From the table, you know that there are four possible outcomes. Only one of those outcomes is
heads/heads.
P (heads/heads) = 1
4

Therefore, the probability of both coins landing heads up is 1
4
, or 25%.
In this problem, you had very few possible events to list. In other problems, however, you might
have many possible events to account for. Another way to solve this problem is by following these steps:
Step 1: Determine the probability that each event will occur.
Step 2: Multiply the probabilities together. The product is the probability that the two events
will occur.

Let’s redo the last example using this method.
Example: You toss a penny and a dime into the air. What is the probability that both coins will land
heads up?
Step 1: Determine the probability that each event will occur.
Each coin has two sides: heads and tails.
The probability that the penny will land heads up is 1
2
.
The probability that the dime will land heads up is 1
2
.
Step 2: Multiply the probabilities together. The product is the probability that the two events
will occur together.
1
2
 × 1
2
 = 1
4

Therefore, the probability of both coins landing heads up is 1
4
, or 25%.
Notice that the two events in the last example are indepen-
dent of one another. Tossing the penny into the air does not
affect the probability of outcome of tossing the dime into
the air, or vice versa.
Dependent Events
Sometimes the ﬁrst event does affect the probability of next event. In this case, the events are said to
be dependent. Let’s look at an example.
Example: A sack holds three purple buttons, two orange buttons, and ﬁve green buttons. What is the
probability of drawing one purple button out of the sack and then—without replacing the ﬁrst but-
ton—drawing a second purple button out of the sack?
Step 1: Determine the probability that each event will occur. First, notice that the ﬁrst event—
drawing a purple button out of the sack—affects the probability of the second event because it
changes both the number of purple buttons still in the sack as well as the total number of buttons
in the sack.
The probability of drawing the ﬁrst purple button is 1
3
0.
The probability of drawing a second purple button is 2
9
.

Problems
These problems apply the skills you’ve learned in Section 5 to everyday situations. As you work
through these problems, you’ll see that the skills you’ve learned in this section aren’t only important
for math tests, they are important skills for ordinary questions that come up every day.
After you’ve arrived at an answer for a problem, ask yourself
if the answer makes sense. For example, the answer to a prob-
lem asking for the mean, median, or mode should always be
in between the lowest and highest numbers in the series
given. If your answer is outside the range, you should take
another look at your answer.

7. To determine the median, ﬁrst put the numbers in sequential order: 8, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 17. The
middle number is the median, so the median is 10. The number 8 occurs twice in the series, so

Graphs,
Tables,
and Charts
IN CLASS, ON tests, and in your day-to-day life you see
graphs, tables, and charts everywhere. They organize informa-
tion visually, so that you can see what it looks like instead of
having a list of numbers. For example, when you watch a base-
ball game on TV, television sports producers flash tables and
charts on the screen so viewers can absorb information about
a team’s standings in the league or a player’s averages at a glance
and quickly return to the game. The goal of graphs, tables, and
charts is to explain a problem, situation, or opportunity so view-
ers can draw a conclusion, find a solution, or develop a plan.
An effective chart finds relationships that were hidden behind
the raw numbers or pages of text on which the chart was based.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn three ways data is shown visually in
graphs and charts. You’ll learn how to read and interpret pie charts,
line graphs, and bar graphs as well as how to decide when one type
of chart or graph is better suited to a set of data than another
type of graph.
When you pick up the newspaper or watch a news report on TV, you’ll often see information
presented in a graph. More and more, we give and receive information visually. That’s one reason you’re
likely to ﬁnd graphs on math tests, and a good reason to understand how to read them. Let’s look at
three common kinds of graphs—pie charts, line graphs, and bar graphs.
 PIE CHARTS
Pie charts show how the parts of a whole relate to one another. A pie chart is a circle divided into slices
or wedges—like a pizza. Each slice represents a category. Pie charts are sometimes called circle graphs.
Let’s look at some examples of pie charts and see what kinds of information they can provide.

Example: Susie is a student representative on the computer lab committee. The committee wants to
build a new computer lab at Martin Luther King, Jr., Middle School. The committee needs to raise
$50,000. The pie chart below shows how they plan to spend the money. Use the pie chart to answer
these questions.
a. How much of the money does the committee plan to spend on new computers?
b. What percent of the budget is to be spent on new computers and upgraded software?
c. What percent of the budget will not be spent on new computers or upgraded software?
Explanations:
a. The committee wants to raise $50,000. According to the pie chart, 50%, or half, of this money
will be spent on new computers. So, $25,000 is budgeted for new computers.
b. According to the pie chart, 50% of the budget will go toward the purchase of new comput-
ers and 15% of the budget will go toward the purchase of upgraded software. Therefore, the
committee plans to use 65% (50% + 15%) of the budget to buy new computers and software.
c. There are two ways of approaching this question. Since you already know that 65% of the
budget is set aside for new computers and upgraded software, you could subtract 65% from
100% to get 35%. Or, you could add up the other items in the pie chart:
Construction
20%
Furniture
10%
+Miscellaneous
5%
35%
Using either method, the answer is 35%.

portation and clothing combined?
d. If the Johnsons make $2,000 each month, how much do they save each month?
 LINE GRAPHS
Line graphs show how two categories of data or information (sometimes called variables) relate to one
another. The data is displayed on a grid and is presented on a scale using a horizontal and a vertical
axis for the different categories of information the graph is comparing. Usually, each data point is con-
nected together to form a line so that you can see trends in the data, or how the data changes over time.
Therefore, often you will see line graphs with time on the horizontal axis. Let’s look at an example of
a line graph and see what kinds of information it can provide.

Example: Julia was very excited when her baby sister was born. She made the following line graph
to chart her sister’s weight gain over the ﬁrst year. Use the line graph to answer the following questions.
a.
What variable is shown on the vertical axis? What variable is shown on the horizontal
axis?
b. During which two-month period did Isabel have the greatest weight gain?
c.
During which two-month period did Isabel have the smallest weight gain?
d. The average weight for a one-year-old girl is 20 pounds. How much more than average
did Isabel weigh at one year?
e.
How much weight did Isabel gain during her ﬁrst year?
Explanations:
a.
Look at the labels. Isabel’s weight in pounds is shown on the vertical axis. Her age in
months is shown on the horizontal axis.
b. Look at how steep the line is. The steepest part of the line represents the fastest weight
gain. The line is the steepest between 10 and 12 months. Isabel gained the most weight
during this time.
c.
Look at how steep the line is. The ﬂattest part of the line represents the slowest weight
gain. The line is ﬂattest between 8 and 10 months. Isabel gained the least weight during
this period.
d. According to the graph, Isabel weighed about 26 pounds at 12 months. Subtract the aver-
age weight from this amount:
26 −20 = 6
Isabel weighed about 6 pounds more than the average girl at twelve months.

Isabel gained about 18 pounds during her ﬁrst year.
Line graphs are often used to show the results of a scientific
experiment. The variable that the scientist is measuring and
tracking is often called the dependent variable. It is usually
measured on the vertical axis of a graph. The horizontal axis
is usually measuring time, so you can see how the data
changes over time.

 BAR GRAPHS
Like pie charts, bar graphs show how different categories of data relate to one another. A bar represents
each category. The length of the bar represents the relative frequency of the category—compared to
the other categories on the graph. Let’s look at an example of a bar graph and see what kinds of infor-
mation it can provide.

Both pie charts and bar graphs are used to compare differ-
ent categories of data. So when you have data to graph, how
do you decide which kind of graph to use? Think about what
your purpose is. If your purpose is to compare the absolute
values of each category, then a bar chart is probably better
because the amounts of each category are shown in compar-
ison to each other. If your purpose is to show how each part
relates to the whole, a pie chart is probably better.
Example: Vaughan’s teacher asked him to compare the rainfall in Cherokee County this year with
the average rainfall in Cherokee County over the last ﬁve years. He constructed the following graph
using data from his local library. Use the bar graph to answer the following questions.
a.
What does each bar represent? What is the difference between the shaded bars and the
white bars?
b. During which months is the rainfall in 2002 greater than the average rainfall?
c.
During which months is the rainfall in 2002 less than the average rainfall?

Explanations
a.
Look at the labels and the key. Each bar represents the number of inches of rainfall during
a particular month. From the key, you know that the shaded bars represent the average
monthly rainfall for 1997–2001. The white bars represent the rainfall in 2002.
b. Compare the white bars with the shaded bars. Rainfall in 2002 is greater than average dur-
ing the months that the white bar is taller than the shaded bar for that month. Rainfall in
2002 was greater than the average rainfall during January, February, and March.
c.
Compare the white bars with the shaded bars. Rainfall in 2002 is less than average during
the months that the shaded bar is taller than the white bar for that month. Rainfall in
2002 was less than the average rainfall during April, May, and June.
d. Compare the height of the white bars for January and April. In April, 6 inches of rain fell.
In January, 4 inches of rain fell. Then subtract: 6 −4 = 2. So, In April, 2 more inches of
rain fell than in January.
e.
Compare the height of the shaded bar and the white bar for January. The shaded bar rep-
resents 2 inches. The white bar represents 4 inches. Subtract: 4 −2 = 2. So, two more
inches of rain fell in January 2002 than on average during the last ﬁve years in January.
The bar chart in the last example compares the amount of rain-
fall over time. This could have been shown on a line graph.
In fact, line graphs often show the change in one variable
over time. So how do you decide when to use a bar graph and
when to use a line graph? Again, it depends on your purpose.
If you want to emphasize the trend—how the variable changed
over time—then a line graph is better. If you want to com-
pare the relative sizes of each category, a bar chart is bet-
ter. Also, if you have many categories, a line graph will be
easier for your reader to read than a bar graph.

Getting
Information
from Tables
and Charts
LESSON SUMMARY
You already know how information is presented in graphs. Infor-
mation can also be organized into tables and charts. In this les-
son, you will learn about different kinds of tables and charts and
how to read and understand the information in them.
Textbooks, almanacs, newspapers, websites, and yes, even math tests are ﬁlled with tables and charts.
Tables and charts organize information. If you take just about any kind of standardized test, you are
likely to be asked to ﬁnd speciﬁc information in several different kinds of tables and charts.
 GETTING INFORMATION FROM TABLES
Tables present information in rows and columns. Rows go across, or horizontally. Columns go up and
down, or vertically. The box, or cell, that is made where a row and a column meet provides speciﬁc
information. When looking for information in tables, it’s important to read the table title, the column
headings, and the row labels so you understand the information you are looking at. Let’s look at some
examples of tables and the types of information you might expect to learn from them.
Frequency tables are used to track how often things happen.

Example: Margie works in the school library. She keeps track of why students come to the library.
Here is the frequency table she made for the students she spoke with last week.
Based on Margie’s frequency table, why did most of the students come to the school library
last week?
Step 1: Look in the column containing tally marks. Each mark represents one student.
Step 2: Find the cell with the most tally marks in it.
If you look in the table, you will see that the ﬁrst cell has the most tally marks in it.
Step 3: Trace your ﬁnger over to the reason given. This is the reason most of the students Margie
tracked came to the school library last week. The reason most students visited the library last week
was to check out a book.
Example: Look at Margie’s frequency table in the last example. How many students came to the library
to look up information last week?
Step 1: Find the row that says, “Look up information.”
Step 2: Slide your ﬁnger over to the tally marks associated with this reason. Then, count the tally
marks. Each mark represents one student, and each group of marks with a slash through it rep-
resents ﬁve students.
If you count the marks, you will see that there are eight (one group of ﬁve, plus three more
marks). Therefore, eight students came to the library last week to look up information.
Example: Look at Margie’s frequency table again. How many more students came to the library because
their teacher told them to than the number who came to study for a test?
Step 1: Count the tally marks for Required by teacher.
There are 26 marks.
Step 2: Count the tally marks for Study for a test.
There are 12 marks.
Step 3: Subtract: 26 −12 = 14. Therefore, 14 more students came to the library because they were
required to by their teacher than those who came to study for a test.

Mileage tables are common in atlases and on maps. They tell you how many miles apart dif-
ferent places are.
Example: Maria’s family used the following mileage table to plan their summer vacation this year.
How far is it from Fairﬁeld to Center?
Find Fairﬁeld in the second row. Move your ﬁnger across until it’s under the column head-
ing Center. Or, you can begin by going to the column heading for Fairﬁeld and move your ﬁnger
down to the row label Center. The number in the cell represents the number of miles between the
two cities. The answer is 67 miles.
No matter what kind of a table you are looking at, you can
use the strategy in the last example to find the information
requested. Read the column and row labels to locate the exact
information requested.
Example: Look again at the mileage table Maria’s family used. If her family decides to drive from
Fairﬁeld to Center, then from Center to Smithville, how many miles will they drive?
Step 1: Find the number of miles between Fairﬁeld and Center. You know this already from the
last example. It’s 67 miles.
Step 2: Find the number of miles between Center and Smithville. It’s 98 miles.
Step 3: Add the two numbers together: 67 + 92 = 159.
The answer is 159 miles.

Flow Charts
Flow charts often show the steps in a process.
Example: Joachim is writing a report for school about corn. He found the following ﬂow chart in a
pamphlet from a corn processor.
What ﬁve products are made using corn?
Look at the ﬂow chart. At the bottom, the products of each process are listed. These are corn
oil, animal feed, starches, sweeteners, and alcohol and other chemicals.
Example: Look at the ﬂow chart. What three parts of corn are used to make food for animals?
Find animal feed in the chart. Then, follow the arrows to see which corn products are used
to make it. These are germ, ﬁber, and gluten.
Example: Look at the ﬂow chart again. Which is reﬁned ﬁrst, corn oil or corn syrup?
Look at the middle row of arrows in the ﬂow chart. Notice that the corn oil is reﬁned ﬁrst.
The corn syrup is reﬁned last. So corn oil is reﬁned before corn syrup.

Timelines
Timelines are used to show the sequence of events over time.
Example: Hakim found the following timeline in his history textbook.
Did NATO form before or after the Korean War began?
Look at the dates on the timeline. Find when each event occurred. NATO formed in 1949.
The Korean War began in 1950. So NATO formed before the Korean War began.
Example: Look at the timeline again. How many years passed between the division of Korea and the
beginning of the Korean War?
Korea divided into two regions in 1945. The Korean War didn’t begin until 1950. Subtract:
1950 −1945 = 5. So ﬁve years passed between the division of Korea and the beginning of the Korean
War.
Here are some things for you to keep in mind as you read a
timeline.
■Look at the time covered by the timeline. Ask yourself
these questions: When does it begin? When does it
end?
■Look at the sequence of events listed in the timeline.
Ask yourself: How much time passes between each
event listed in the timeline?

■Think about events that are not listed in the timeline.
Ask yourself: What other events were going on during
this time?
■Think about how the events are related to one another.
Ask yourself: Does one of these events cause another?
How does each event relate to an earlier or a later
event?
Venn Diagrams
Venn diagrams are used to show how things are similar and different. They are often used in math when
talking about sets of numbers. They can also be used to compare characteristics of groups.
Example: The following Venn diagram shows the kinds of socks and pants that students in Mrs. Scott’s
class were wearing on Monday.
According to the diagram, how many students in Mrs. Scott’s class were wearing jeans on
Monday?
Look at the key. The circle labeled J represents all the students in Mrs. Scott’s class who were
wearing jeans on Monday. This circle contains the numbers 19 and 4. Add: 19 + 4 = 23. So 23 students
were wearing jeans in Mrs. Scott’s class on Monday.

Example: Look at the Venn diagram again. How many students were wearing either jeans or colored
socks but not both jeans and colored socks?
The key tells you that the circle labeled J represents all the students in Mrs. Scott’s class who
wore jeans on Monday. The circle labeled C represents all the students in Mrs. Scott’s class who wore
colored socks on Monday. The part of the two circles that overlaps represents students who were wear-
ing both jeans and colored socks on Monday.
To answer this question, you need to add the number of students who wore either jeans or
colored socks, but not both. So add 19 + 8 = 27. The answer is 27.
Example: Look at the Venn diagram again. How many students were in Mrs. Scott’s class on Monday?
The box labeled S represents all the students present, or the total number of students, in
Mrs. Scott’s class on Monday. When people talk about Venn diagrams, they often call this box The Uni-
verse. It tells you what the largest set, or total, being discussed in the diagram is. 
There were 35 students in Mrs. Scott’s class on Monday.
Example: Look at the Venn diagram one last time. How many students were wearing neither jeans
nor colored socks on Monday in Mrs. Scott’s class?
To answer this question, you need to subtract the number of students wearing jeans and\or
colored socks from the total number of students in class that day. You know there were 35 students in
class. There were 31 (19 + 4 + 8) students wearing jeans and\or colored socks. Subtract: 35 −31 = 4.
There were only four students wearing neither jeans nor colored socks in Mrs. Scott’s class on Monday.

b. Clothing; 4%
c.
According to the graph, 22% of the budget is spent on food.
Transportation and clothing combined make up 13% (9% +
4%) of the budget. So, 22 −13 = 9. Thus, 9% more money is
spent on food than on transportation and clothing combined.
d. According to the graph, 10% is spent on savings. Ten percent

Look at the labels. The plant’s height is measured in inches on the vertical axis. Time in
days is measured on the horizontal axis.
b. Use a ruler or a straight edge of paper to guide your eye up from day 9 on the graph.
Then trace over to the height. The plant was probably about 4 inches tall on day 9.
c.
Look at how steep the line is. The steepest part of the line represents the fastest growth.
The line is the steepest between days 19 and 21.
d. Look at how steep the line is. The ﬂattest part of the line represents the slowest growth.
The line is ﬂattest between days 23 and 25.
e.
The plant was about 1 inch tall on day 1. It was about 10 inches tall on day 25. Subtract:
10 −1 = 9. The plant grew about 9 inches over the time that Edwin measured it.

a.
Look at the labels. The percent of workers using each form of transportation is shown on
the vertical axis. Population density in workers per acre is shown on the horizontal axis.
b. First, ﬁnd the line that represents “using public transportation to get to work.” Where is
this line highest on the graph? When the population density is highest, at 150 workers per
acre, 70% of workers use public transportation in the more populated areas, more than at
any other density. Therefore, people are more likely to use public transportation in areas
where the population is most dense: 150 workers per acre.
c.
First, ﬁnd the line that represents “using your own car to get to work.” Look for the point
where this line is highest on the graph. When the population is least dense, the line is at
100%, higher than it is at any other point on the graph. Therefore, people are most likely
to drive their own car to work in areas where the population is not very dense: 1 worker
per acre.
d. Find the line that moves down as population density increases. It’s the line representing
“using your own car to get to work.” This is the form of transportation that decreases as
population density increases.
6. a.
Read the labels. Each bar represents the amount of dog food in pounds a different breed
of dog consumed in one month.
b. The tallest bar represents the most food eaten. The mastiff ate about 42 pounds of food—
more than any other breed shown.
c.
The shortest bar represents the smallest amount of food eaten. The shih tzu ate about 4
pounds of food—less than any other breed shown.
d. Subtract: 42 −4 = 38. The mastiff ate 38 more pounds of food than did the shih tzu.
e.
Subtract the amount the shih tzu ate from the amount the beagle ate: 16 −4 = 12. The
beagle ate 12 more pounds of food than did the shih tzu.
7. a.
Each bar represents the number of millions of people who participate in a given sport.
b. The longest bar represents the most popular sport: walking.

b. The bar representing water usage for this month last year is 365. The label says that the
numbers represent hundreds of gallons. So, this month last year, the Garcias used 365 ×
100 = 36,500. The answer is 36,500 gallons.
c.
Find the amounts of water used this month last year and last month. Then subtract:
36,500 −14,600 = 21,900. The answer is 21,900 gallons.
d. You want to know the price per gallon, so divide 74.00 ÷ 35,700 = 0.002. The answer is
less than one penny!
6. a.
First, ﬁnd Alex’s little brother’s age: 24 months. Then move up to ﬁnd his weight: 28
pounds. Trace the line that his weight falls on to the percentile label: Alex is in the 50th
percentile for weight. (This means that about half of two-year-old boys weigh more and
about half weigh less than Alex’s little brother.) Now do the same things for Alex’s little
brother’s height. He’s in the 25th percentile for height. (This means that about 75% of
boys are taller than Alex’s little brother.)
b. First, ﬁnd 33 months on the height chart. Move your ﬁnger down to the 95th percentile
line. The point where these intersect is the height of a 33-month-old child in the 95th
percentile: 40 inches.
c.
Find 6 pounds and birth on the weight chart. Then follow the percentile line up to its
label. Alex’s little brother was in the 5th percentile at birth for weight. (That means that
most other babies weighed more than he did at birth.)

Introduction
to Algebra
ALGEBRA IS THE branch of mathematics that denotes quan-
tities with letters and uses negative numbers as well as ordi-
nary numbers. There are many faces of algebra. You can inter-
pret a sentence and translate it into algebra. You can take an
algebraic expression and turn it into words. You may work with
a “solve for x” question, or a “simplify the equation” question.
This section will give you a basic introduction to algebra, so
you understand how you can use it to solve problems in the real
world.

LESSON SUMMARY
This lesson will introduce you to the basic vocabulary of algebra.
You will learn what an algebraic expression is. You will also learn
how to evaluate and simplify algebraic expressions. In short, this
lesson will prepare you for the next lesson on solving algebraic
equations.
Algebra is a branch of math that uses letters to represent unknown numbers. A letter that repre-
sents an unknown number is called a variable. You often use algebra to translate everyday situations
into a math sentence so that you can then solve problems.
 WHAT ARE ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS?
An algebraic expression is a group of numbers, variables (letters), and operation signs (+, −, ÷, and so on). Vari-
ables are usually written in italics. For example, the x in the following algebraic expressions is the variable:
5x + 2
3x −8
4
9
x
Any letter can be used to represent a number in an algebraic expression. The letters, x, y, and z
are commonly used.
Algebraic expressions translate the relationship between numbers into math symbols. The fol-
lowing are some examples.

When multiplying a number and a variable, you just have to write them side by side. You don’t
need to use a multiplication symbol.
Notice that the value of an algebraic expression changes as
the value of the variable (here, x) changes. Let’s look at the
first algebraic expression listed above: x + 6.
If x = 1, then x + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7.
If x = 2, then x + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8.
If x = 3, then x + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9.
If x = 100, then x + 6 = 100 + 6 = 106.
If x = 213, then x + 6 = 213 + 6 = 219.
Example: Translate the following math relationship into an algebraic expression: the quotient of three
divided by a number plus the difference between three and two.
Step 1: You know that the word quotient means to divide, so you write
3 ÷
Step 2: The word number represents your variable, so you write
3 ÷ x
Step 3: The word plus means to add, so you write
3 ÷ x +
Step 4: The word difference means to subtract, so you write
3 ÷ x + (3 −2)
Remember from Lesson 1 (the order of operations), that parentheses are used to indicate an oper-
ation that should be performed ﬁrst.
So, the answer is 3 ÷ x + (3 −2).

 EVALUATING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
Algebraic expressions have speciﬁc values only when the variables have values. Finding the value of an
algebraic expression by plugging in the known values of its variables is called evaluating an expression.

Example: Evaluate 5 ÷ (x + y), when x = 2 and y = 3.
Step 1: Plug the numbers into the algebraic expression.
5 ÷ (2 + 3)
Step 2: Solve by following the order of operations.
Add the numbers in parenthesis: 5 ÷ (2 + 3) = 5 ÷ 5
Divide: 5 ÷ 5 = 1
The answer is 1.
Whether you are working with numbers or variables, the
order of operations is the same. Remember the order of oper-
ations from Lesson 1—Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.

THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS
STEP 1:
Do all the operations in parentheses. Then solve for exponents.
STEP 2:
Multiply and divide numbers in order from left to right.
STEP 3:
Add and subtract numbers in order from left to right.

Variables can represent any quantity. A variable might be a
whole number, a decimal, or a fraction, for example. A vari-
able can also represent a signed number—a number with a
positive (+) or a negative (–) sign in front of it. Any num-
ber can have a sign in front of it. If a number has no sign in
front of it, it is + (positive).
Signed whole numbers and zero make up a group of num-
bers called integers. Integers are often represented on a num-
ber line like the one shown below. Zero (0) is in the center
of the line, and numbers to the left of the zero are negative,
while the numbers to the right of zero are positive.
You can use a number line to add and subtract signed whole
numbers. Here’s how it works.
EXAMPLE: 8 + (−4)
Step 1: 8 is positive since there is no negative sign in
front of it.
Step 2: Start at zero. Then, move 8 units in the positive
direction (to the right), as shown below.
Step 3: The sign in front of the 4 is −(negative). So you
need to move 4 units in the negative direction (to the
left) as shown below.
Thus, the answer is 4.
On the next page are some basic rules to help you add, sub-
tract, multiply, and divide signed numbers.

 SIMPLIFYING ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS
The parts of an algebraic expression are called terms. A term is a number or a number and the variables
associated with it. For example, the following algebraic expression has three terms:
Algebraic expression: 5x2 −5x + 1
Terms: +5x2, −5x, +1
As you can see, the terms in an algebraic expression are separated by + and −signs. Notice that
the sign in front of each term is included as part of that term—the sign is always part of the term. If no
sign is given, then the term is positive (+).
Still not sure how to break an algebraic expression into its
terms? Try these. Break each algebraic expression into 
its terms.

Simplifying an algebraic expression means to combine like terms. Like terms are terms that use the
same variable and are raised to the same power. Here are some examples of like terms.
LIKE TERMS
BOTH TERMS CONTAIN
5x and 9x
x
3x2 and 8x2
x2
xy and −5xy
xy
When you combine like terms, you group all the terms that are alike together. This makes it eas-
ier to evaluate the expression later on.
Example: Simplify the following algebraic expression: 5x + 3y + 9x.
Step 1: Write the like terms next to each other.
You know that 5x and 9x are like terms because they both have x. So write them next to each
other: 5x + 9x + 3y
Step 2: Combine the like terms.
Add the like terms:
5x + 9x + 3y = 14x + 3y
You can’t simplify the 3y because there are no other terms in the expression with the vari-
able y. So you leave it alone.
The simpliﬁed expression is 14x + 3y.
Example: Simplify the following algebraic expression: 2x2 + 3y + 9xy + 3y2
Step 1: Write the like terms next to each other.
There are no like terms in this expression. It’s already simpliﬁed.
Example: Simplify the following algebraic expression: 5x(2x −1) + 9x
Step 1: Write the like terms next to each other. Begin by distributing the 5x so that you can remove
the parentheses.
Multiply: 5x(2x −1)
10x2 −5x
So now your equation is 10x2 −5x + 9x
Now you can see that −5x and 9x are like terms because each contains the x term.
Step 2: Combine the like terms.
Add the like terms: −5x + 9x = 4x
Now your equation is simpliﬁed to 10x2 −4x
You can’t simplify further because there are no other terms in the expression with the same
variable. Therefore, the simpliﬁed expression is 10x2 −4x.

When combining like terms, begin by solving to remove the
parentheses. If a negative sign comes in front of a set of
parentheses, it affects every term inside the parentheses.
Here’s an example.
EXAMPLE: 2(x  3y +2)
When you multiply each term inside the parentheses by 2,
you get the following:
2x + 6y  4
Notice that the negative sign () affects each term inside
the parentheses.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn what an algebraic equation is. You
will also learn how to solve one-step and multiple-step algebraic
equations.
A n algebraic equation is a math sentence. It always has an equals (=) sign. Algebraic equations say
one quantity is equal to another quantity. Here are a few examples of algebraic equations.
5 + x = 25
x −5 = 25
5x = 25
 HOW TO SOLVE ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS
Solving an algebraic equation means that you have to ﬁnd the value of the variable. To solve for the
value of the variable, you ﬁrst need to get it alone on one side of the equals sign. This is sometimes
called isolating the variable.

Team-LRN

You know from Lesson 1 that addition and subtraction are
inverse operations. (They “undo” each other; for example, if
3  6 = 9, then 9  6 = 3 and 9  3 = 6.) Multiplication and
division are also inverse operations. (They also “undo” each
other; for example, if 30 ÷ 6 = 5, then 5 × 6 = 30.) So, when
addition is on the variable side of the equation, you should
subtract to isolate the variable. When you see subtraction, you
should add. When you see multiplication, you should divide,
and when you see division, you should multiply. And if a vari-
able is squared, you should take the square root of it. Got it?
You want to get the variable alone on one side of the equals sign, so you perform mathematical
operations to both sides of the equation to isolate the variable. With every step you take to solve the
equation, you should ask yourself, “What operations can I use to get the x alone on one side of the
equals sign?” But remember, whatever you do to one side of the equation, you have to do to the other.
Let’s try some examples to see how it works.
Example: Solve the following algebraic expression: x + 5 = 10.
Step 1: Ask yourself: What operation is used in the equation? Addition. In order to get the x alone,
you will need to get rid of the 5. So, you should use the inverse operation and subtract. Remember,
you have to perform the operation to both sides of the equation.
x + 5 = 10
−5 −5 
Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.
Step 2: Combine like terms on both sides of the equals sign.
x + 5 = 10
−5 −5
x + 0 = 5 
All like terms have been combined.
Therefore, x = 5.
Step 3: You can check your answer by going back to the original equation and plugging in your
answer for x. If your answer makes the algebraic expression true, then it’s correct. Let’s try it out:
x + 5 = 10, and x = 5, so 5 + 5 = 10. You know that 10 = 10, so your answer, x = 5 is correct.
Example: Solve the following algebraic expression: z −3 = 8.
Step 1: Ask yourself: What operation is used in the equation? Subtraction. What is the inverse
operation of subtraction? Addition. So, add 3 to each side of the equation in order to isolate the
variable.

z −3 = 8
+ 3 + 3 
Add 3 to each side of the equation.
Step 2: Combine like terms on both sides of the equals sign.
z −3 = 8
+ 3 + 3 
z + 0 = 11 
All like terms have been combined.
z = 11
Therefore, z = 11.
Check your answer by going back to the original equation and plugging in your answer. z −3 = 8, and
z = 11, so 11 −3 = 8. You know that 8 = 8, so your answer, z = 11 is correct.
Example: Solve the following algebraic expression: 5r = −25.
Step 1: Ask yourself: What operation is used in the equation? Multiplication. What is the inverse
operation of this multiplication? Division. So, divide each side of the equation by 5 in order to
isolate the variable:
5

r = −

Divide each side of the equation by 5
Step 2: Combine like terms on both sides of the equals sign

ation of this division? Multiplication. So, multiply each side of the equation by 2 in order to iso-
late the variable.
2 × 2

 = 12 × 2 
Multiply each side of the equation by 2 to isolate the variable.

 SOLVING MULTIPLE STEP ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS
The algebraic equations you’ve solved so far in this lesson have almost all required one inverse oper-
ation. But some algebraic equations require more than one inverse operation to isolate the variable and
then solve the equation.
When solving multiple-step algebraic equations, you should ﬁrst add or subtract. Then, multiply
or divide. In other words, you follow the order of operations in inverse order! Another way to look at
it is to solve for the number attached to the variable last. Let’s look at some examples.
Example: Solve the following algebraic expression: 2m + 5 = 13.
Step 1: First, look for numbers that are being added or subtracted to the term with the variable.
In this equation, 5 is added to the 2m. To simplify, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation.
2m + 5 = 13
−5 −5 
Subtract 5 from either side of the equation.
2m

Step 2: Perform the inverse operation for any multiplication or division. The variable in this equa-

Many multiple-step algebraic equations can be solved in more
than one way. When you check your answers in the answer
key, don’t worry if you followed slightly different steps to
get to the correct answer. The main thing to keep in mind is
to add or subtract first. Then, multiply or divide.
Example: Solve the following algebraic expression: 5p + 24 = 3p −4.
Step 1: This equation has a variable on each side of the equals sign. So, you ﬁrst need to get the
variable terms on one side of the equation. You can do this by subtracting the smaller of the two
variables from each side because they have like terms.
5p + 24 = 3p −4
5p + 24 = 3p −4
−3p
−3p
Subtract 3p from both sides of the equation.
2p + 24 =
− 4
Step 2: Look for numbers that are being added or subtracted to the term with the variable. In
this equation, 24 is added to the 2p. So you subtract 24 from both sides of the equation.
2p + 24 = −4
−24 −24 
Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to isolate the variable.
2p
= −28
Step 3: Perform the inverse operation for any multiplication or division. The variable in this equa-
tion is multiplied by 2, so you divide each side of the equation by 2 to isolate the variable.
2
2
p = −
2
28

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate the variable.
Therefore, the answer is p = −14.
Example: Solve the following algebraic expression: 4(b + 1) = 20.
Step 1: This equation has parentheses, so you need to remove the parentheses by distributing 
the 4.
4(b + 1) = 4b + 4
So, your equation becomes
4b + 4 = 20
Step 2: Look for numbers that are being added or subtracted to the term with the variable. Sub-
tract 4 from both sides of the equation.
4b + 4 = 20
− 4 − 4 
Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation.
4b
= 16

Problems
These problems apply the skills you’ve learned in Section 7 to everyday situations. As you work
through these problems, you’ll see that the skills you’ve learned in this section aren’t only important
for math tests. They are important skills for questions that come up every day that you need to solve.
Don’t forget to use all the skills you’ve learned in previous chapters translating word sentences to math
sentences. Also, refer to the table Translating Math Relationships into Algebraic Expressions on p. 245 if
you need to refresh your memory.
Algebraic expressions and equations are very useful in solv-
ing the types of word problems you are likely to find on math
tests. Here are some tips for solving these types of problems.
■First, read the problem to determine what you are
looking for.
■Then, write the amount you are looking for in terms of
x (or whatever letter you want to use). You can do this
by writing “Let x =  . . . .” Write any other unknown
amounts in terms of x, too.
■Lastly, set up the algebraic expressions in an equation
with an equals sign and solve for the variable.

We can apply the 3:2:1 ratio to an algebraic formula: 3x + 2x + 1x = total number of jelly-
beans. The 3x represents the blue jellybeans, the 2x represents the red jellybeans, and the
1x represents the green jellybeans. We know that the total number of jellybeans = 12,000,
so we have:
3x + 2x + 1x = 12,000
6x = 12,000
x = 2,000
Remember, we want “red jellybeans” = 2x = 2 × 2,000 = 4,000.

Let’s call our number “N.” Looking at the statement, the ﬁrst part says “Ten times 40% of
a number . . . ”. We can express this mathematically as 10 × .40N. Remember that 40% is
the same as .40 and “of” means multiply. The next part of the statement is “ . . . is equal to
4 less than the product of 6 times the number.” This can be expressed as = 6N −4. Putting
it all together, we have 10 × .40N = 6N −4, or 4N = 6N −4. We add 4 to both sides to get
4 + 4N = 6N. Next, subtract 4N from both sides to yield 4 = 2N, thus, N = 2.

important geometry vocabulary in this section so that you’ll
understand the language of geometry. You’ll also learn impor-
tant facts to help you see how geometry fits into your every-
day life.

LESSON SUMMARY
This lesson introduces the basic vocabulary of geometry. You will
learn about points, lines, rays, line segments, and angles.
Take a moment to look around you, and you’ll see geometry everywhere. The pages of this book,
your computer screen, and your desk are all rectangular. Keep looking around and you’ll ﬁnd triangles,
circles, and other geometric shapes. In this lesson, you’ll learn some basic words in the language of
geometry.
 BREAKING THINGS DOWN
You are probably already familiar with many two-dimensional and three-dimensional shapes, but geometry
involves more than squares and cubes. Let’s begin with the basics—the pieces that make these shapes up.

7. Look at the ﬁgure below. Then, answer the questions.
a.
List as many different ways as you can think of to represent this line with symbols. (Hint:
You should ﬁnd six.)
b. Name two different rays that start with the endpoint Y. Write your answer using symbols.
 WHAT ARE ANGLES?
Now that you know about points, lines, rays, and line segments, you are ready to learn about angles.
An angle is formed by two rays that share a common endpoint. One ray forms each side of the angle
and the common endpoint is called the vertex. The ﬁgure below is an example of an angle.
There is more than one way to name an angle. The symbol for an angle is ∠. Here are some ways
to name an angle.
 You can use three letters to name an angle. The middle letter represents the vertex.
For example, the angle above could be named ∠ABC or ∠CBA. In both cases, the B is in
the middle because it represents the vertex, or the endpoint, of the two rays that make up
the angle.
 You can use only one letter to name an angle if the angle you are naming does not
share its vertex point with another angle. For example, the angle is alone. It does not share
its vertex point with any other angle. So, you could name it ∠B.
 You can use a number. Look at the angle above again. Notice that a number is written
inside the angle. Sometimes angles will be numbered in this way. When this number does
not represent the measurement of the angle (we’ll discuss that in just a minute), then you
can use the number to name the angle: ∠1.

9. Give four different names for the following angle.
 MEASURING ANGLES
Angles are measured in a unit called the degree. The symbol for a degree is °. You can use an instru-
ment called a protractor to measure an angle. Most protractors look like a clear plastic ruler with a rounded
edge like the one shown below.
Here’s how to use a protractor to measure an angle.
Step 1: Place the cross mark or hole in the middle of the straight edge of the protractor on the
vertex of the angle you wish to measure. 
Step 2: Line up one of the angle’s rays with one of the zero marks on the protractor. (Note that
there are two zero marks on the protractor. It doesn’t matter which one you use.)
Step 3: Keeping the protractor in place, trace the length of the angle’s other ray out to the curved
part of the protractor. 
Step 4: Read the number closest to the ray. (Notice that there are two rows of numbers on the
protractor. Make sure you are measuring from zero.) This is the measure of the angle in degrees.
Example: Measure the following angle using a protractor.

Step 1: Place the cross mark or hole in the middle of the straight edge of the protractor on the
vertex B.
Step 2: Line up →
BC with the zero mark on the right side of the protractor. 
Step 3: Keeping the protractor in place, trace the length of →
BA out to the curved part of the pro-
tractor. 
Step 4: Read the number closest to →
BA as shown below.
∠ABC is 70°.
When measuring an angle whose rays are shorter than the dis-
tance to the numbers on your protractor, use a ruler to care-
fully extend the lines of the rays. If you keep the rays straight,
your measurement will be accurate. The length of the rays does
not affect the measure of the angle.

middle of the straight edge of the protractor on the ray’s end-
point. Find the degree of the angle you wish to draw along
the curved edge of the protractor. Make sure you are measuring
from zero. Mark the point on your paper next to the number
of degrees you want your angle to be and, using a ruler, con-
nect the first ray’s endpoint to the dot.

 CLASSIFYING ANGLES
Angles are classiﬁed by their measures. They can be acute, obtuse, right, straight, and reﬂex. Here are
some examples of these different kinds of angles.
An acute angle is 
less than 90°.
A right angle is 
exactly 90°.
An obtuse angle is 
greater than 90° 
but less than 180°.
A straight angle is 
exactly 180°.
A reflex angle is 
greater than 180° 
but less than 360°.
This symbol
means the angle
measures 90°

Example: Classify the following angle using the terms in the table on page 287.
Begin by looking at the measure of the angle. It’s 91°. From the table, you know that an
angle that measures more than 90° and less than 180° is called an obtuse angle. So the
angle is obtuse.
PRACTICE
Classify each angle as either acute, right, obtuse, straight, or reﬂex.

When a transversal line intersects two parallel lines, eight angles form as shown in the ﬁgure below.
We call these angles different names, depending upon their relationships both to each other and
to parallel lines. For example, some pairs of angles formed by a transversal and two parallel lines are
said to be congruent. Congruent angles are equal in measure. Some pairs of angles formed by a trans-
versal and two parallel lines are said to be supplementary. The measures of supplementary angles add
up to 180°. Here is a summary of these relationships.

You can use this information to solve many kinds of problems in geometry. Let’s look at an example.
Example: Look at the ﬁgure below. If the measure of ∠1 is 115°, what is the measure of ∠6?
Step 1: Find an angle that is related to both angles. You know that ∠1 and ∠5 are congruent because
they are corresponding angles. You also know that ∠5 and ∠6 are supplementary because they
form a straight line (180°).
Step 2: Find the measure of the angle that has a relationship to both ∠1 and ∠6. You know that
∠1 and ∠5 are congruent because they are alternate exterior angles, and you know that ∠5 and
∠6 are supplementary angles (so, together, they add up to 180). Because you know that ∠1 is 115°,
you also know that ∠5 is 115°.
Step 3: Find the measure of the unknown angle.
∠5 + ∠6 = 180°
So, ∠6 = 180° −115° = 65°
Your ﬁnal answer is 65°.

LESSON SUMMARY
In this lesson, you will learn how to measure different parts of
geometric shapes. You’ll learn how to find the perimeter, circum-
ference, area, and volume of shapes.
Standardized tests often expect you to be able to measure different parts of geometric shapes. But
this is not a skill you need to know only to pass a test. You need to know the perimeter of your yard if
you want to enclose it with a fence. You need to know the area of your room if you want to carpet it.
This lesson will not only help you pass any math test, it will also help you improve skills you will use
for many different practical tasks.
 FINDING PERIMETER AND CIRCUMFERENCE
Perimeter is the distance around a ﬁgure. You can calculate the perimeter of a ﬁgure by adding up the
length of each side.

Example: Find the perimeter of a square whose side is 5 cm.
You know that each side of a square is equal. So, if you know that one side of a square is 5 cm, then you
know that each side of the square is 5 cm. To calculate the perimeter, add up the length of all four sides.
5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 20
So, the perimeter of a square whose side measures 5 cm is 20 cm.
Another way to calculate the perimeter of a square is 4 × s,
where s = the length of one side of the square. So, the perime-
ter of a square whose side measures 5 cm would be 4 × 5 =
20 cm.
Example: Find the perimeter of the following ﬁgure.
Add up the lengths of each side of the ﬁgure.
22 + 3 + 5 + 15 + 45 + 4 + 5 + 18 = 117
The perimeter of the ﬁgure is 117 meters.
When you are solving problems with units, be sure to always
include the unit with your measurement. Numbers are not very
useful or meaningful measurements unless you know the units
in which your measurements are being made.

The perimeter of a circle is called its circumference. You can calculate a circle’s circumference using
either its radius or its diameter. 
The diameter is a line segment that goes through the center of a circle. The endpoints of the diam-
eter are on the circle. Any line that begins at the center of a circle and ends on a point on the circle is
called a radius. A circle’s diameter is twice as long as its radius. So, if you know either the radius or the
diameter, you can easily ﬁnd the other.
To calculate circumference, use either of these formulas, where π = 3.14 (π is a Greek symbol,
spelled pi, and pronounced pie), d is the circle’s diameter, and r is the circle’s radius:
C = πd
C = 2πr
Example: Find the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 5 inches.
Since you know the diameter, use the formula that include the diameter: C = πd.
C = π (5)
= (3.14)(5)
=  15.7
The ﬁnal answer is 15.7 inches.
If you’re not allowed to use a calculator on a test, you can
estimate the circumference of a circle by substituting 3 for
π.

Find the perimeter or circumference of each ﬁgure. You can check your answers at the end of the section.
1. a square with one side equal to 10 in
2. a rectangle with height equal to 3 ft and length equal to 5 ft
3. a triangle with sides 3 mm, 4 mm, and 5mm

7. The measurements given below are in meters.
8. The ﬁgure below is exactly a quarter circle with a radius 8 cm.
Sometimes your answer may be given in terms of π. You treat
the π symbol as an algebraic variable, and leave it in your
answer. For example, if you were asked to find the circum-
ference of a circle where r = 2, you would plug the 2 into your
equation 2πr: 2π(2) = 4π. 4π would be your final answer.

h(b1 +b2).
Step 2: Plug in the measures for the variables in the formula and solve.

Notice that to calculate the area of a figure, you need two
measurements. Multiplying the units of each measurement
together gives you square units. That’s why area is measured
in square units. (Perimeter was measured in linear units.)

Example: The ﬁgure below has an area of 40 cm2. Find the height of the ﬁgure.
Step 1: Choose the correct formula.
From the table you know that this ﬁgure is a parallelogram. So, you need to use the fol-
lowing formula: A = bh.
Step 2: Plug in the known measures for the variables in the formula and solve for the height.
A = bh

 FINDING VOLUME
Volume is a measure of the amount of space inside a three-dimensional shape. Three-dimensional shapes
are sometimes called solids. Examples of three-dimensional shapes are shown below.
In this lesson, you will learn how to calculate the volume of a rectangular solid, a cube, and a cylin-
der. The formula for calculating the area of these solids is the same.

Notice that to calculate the volume of a figure, you need three
measurements. Multiplying the units of each measurement
together gives you cubic units. You can imagine a cubic unit
as a cube with one unit edges.
Example: Find the volume of a cube that is 3 inches long on each edge.
Step 1: Choose the correct formula. The problem tells you that you are measuring the volume
of a cube. You know from the table that the formula for the volume of a cube is V = Ah or V = s3.

So the ﬁnal answer is 27 in3.

V = πr2h.
Step 2: Plug in the known measures and solve.

V = π(5)2(10)
V = π(25)(10)
V = π(250)
V = 785
So the ﬁnal answer is 785 cm3.

Congruence
and Similarity
LESSON SUMMARY
This lesson introduces the concepts of congruence and similarity.
You will learn how to tell if two triangles are congruent or if they
are similar. You will also learn how to use these concepts to solve
basic geometry problems.
Two ﬁgures that are exactly the same shape and the same size are said to be congruent—they are
exactly identical to one another. Congruent ﬁgures are often used in constructing buildings, quilt pat-
terns, and other things. In contrast, similar ﬁgures are the same shape, but they are not always the same
size. Instead, their sides are in proportion to one another. You can use similar ﬁgures to determine mea-
sures that would otherwise be very difﬁcult to measure—such as the height of a tall building. In this
lesson, you’ll learn about congruent and similar triangles.
 CONGRUENT TRIANGLES
Triangles are congruent if they are exactly the same size and the same shape. You might look at two tri-
angles and guess whether they are the same—you’re probably a pretty good judge as to whether two
triangles are the same size and shape. Or, you could cut out one of the triangles and see if it ﬁts exactly
on top of the other one. If so, they are congruent.

However, geometry is largely about proving things, not guessing about them. So, you need to be
able to use basic geometry rules, such as theorems (formulas or statements in mathematics that can be
proved true) to show that two triangles are congruent. 
Though geometry rules come in different forms, they can be generally understood as statements
that all mathematicians have agreed to accept as true or that can be proved true. Postulates are state-
ments that are accepted without proof. Theorems are statements that can be proved true. You will learn
more about these principles when you take a geometry course. For now, you just need to know that
you must follow certain steps to prove that two triangles are congruent.
In fact, there are three rules for proving that two triangles are congruent to one another. Notice
that the symbol ≅means congruent. When you see this symbol, say the word “congruent.”

RULE NAME

Side-Side-Side (SSS)
If three sides of one triangle are 
congruent to three sides of another 
triangle, then the two triangles are 
congruent. (Note: The lines on each 
side of both triangles corresponds 
with the side of the compared 
triangle that is equal.)

RULE NAME
WHAT IT SAYS
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE
Side-Angle-Side (SAS)
If two sides and the angle they form 
are congruent to the corresponding 
parts of another triangle, then the 
two triangles are congruent.
Angle-Side-Angle (ASA)
If two angles and the side in between 
them of one triangle are congruent to 
the corresponding parts of another 
triangle, then the two triangles are 
congruent.
What does corresponding part mean? This term refers to the
part that is being compared in both triangles. So, if you are
comparing two triangles, you’ll want to name the parts in the
same order in each triangle. You’ll want to compare the
hypotenuse (the side of a right triangle that is opposite the
right angle) of one right triangle with the hypotenuse of
another triangle. You’ll want to compare the 75° angle of one
triangle with the 75° angle of the other triangle. Notice in
the table on pages 308–309 that the parts with the same rel-
ative position (the same number of marks on the side) in each
triangle are always compared.

Here’s how it works.
Example: Is ∠ABC ≅∠FED? (The ≅symbol means congruent.)
Step 1: Ask yourself: which corresponding parts of the triangles does the problem tell me are con-
gruent? You know from the symbols on the triangles that
AB ≅FE
BC ≅ED
∠B ≅∠E
Step 2: Ask yourself: Is one of the rules needed to prove that two triangles are congruent met?
Yes, the given information matches the rule for Side-Angle-Side.
Step 3: Answer the question. Since the criteria for Side-Angle-Side are met, the two triangles are
congruent.
Therefore, the two triangles are congruent: ΔABC ≅ΔFED.
Example: Is ΔPQR ≅ΔZYX?
Step 1: Ask yourself: which corresponding parts of the triangles does the problem tell me are con-
gruent? You know from the symbols on the triangles that PR ≅ ZX and ∠P ≅∠Z.

Step 2: Ask yourself: Is one of the rules needed to prove that two triangles are congruent met?
Not yet. You know only one side and one angle so far.
Step 3: Figure out what information you still need to know to make a decision. You need to know
the measure of ∠X. You know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. So you can deter-
mine the measure of ∠X as follows:
180° −75° −65° = 40°
The measure of ∠X is 40°.
Step 4: Answer the question. Now you know that Angle-Side-Angle is true, so the two triangles
are congruent.
ΔPQR ≅ΔZYX.

If two triangles you are comparing are turned in different
directions and it’s hard to keep track of which parts corre-
spond, quickly redraw one of the triangles so it’s oriented
the same way as the other one. For example, in the last exam-
ple, you might have redrawn the second triangle as shown
below to make the problem easier.
Example: Is ΔABC ∼ΔXYZ?
Step 1: Ask yourself: which corresponding parts of the triangles are likely to be similar? You know

Step 2: Ask yourself: Is one of the rules needed to prove that two triangles are similar met? Since
you do not know the measures of the any of the angles of either triangle, you will have to com-
pare the sides of the triangles. To ﬁnd out if the sides of the triangles are in proportion, you need
to set up a proportion and see if it is true, as shown below.

To test whether the proportion is true, you can cross multiply:
3 × 10  4 × 9
30 ≠36
Because the two sides of the equation are not equal, the sides are not proportional. Side-Side-
Side is not true.
Step 3: Answer the question. Since none of the rules that prove two triangles are similar are met,
the two triangles are not similar.
ΔABC and ΔXYZ are not similar triangles.
Another way to tell if a proportion is correct is to reduce both
ratios to lowest terms. If they reduce to the same ratio, then
they are equal. Let’s look again at the last problem to see
how this works.
You started with the following possible proportion.
3
4  1
9

You know that 3
4 is already reduced to lowest terms. Can 1

0
be reduced to lower terms? No. Since 3
4 ≠1
9
0, you know that
the proportion is not true. So again, you can conclude that
the two triangles are not similar.
Example: At 3 P.M. a ﬁve-meter pole makes a shadow that is 3 meters long. At the same hour, a tree
makes a 21-meter shadow. How tall is the tree? Assume that the two triangles are similar.
Step 1: You know from the problem that the triangles are similar. So you can set up a proportion
to solve for the missing length (the height of the tree).
= 
Step 2: You are looking for the height of the tree, so let x = the height of the tree. Then, plug in
the measures and solve for x.

The
Pythagorean
Theorem
LESSON SUMMARY
This lesson introduces the parts of a right triangle. You will also
learn what the Pythagorean Theorem is and how to use it to cal-
culate the unknown lengths of the sides of right triangles.
You know that a triangle is a ﬁgure made up of three sides that come together to form three angles.
In Lesson 18, you learned that an angle measuring exactly 90° is called a right angle. A triangle that
has a right angle is called a right triangle. The sides and angles of right triangles have special relation-
ships. In this lesson, you will learn about one of those relationships, which is called the Pythagorean
Theorem.
 THE PARTS OF A RIGHT TRIANGLE
Before you can use the Pythagorean Theorem, you need to know the basic parts of a right triangle. As
you know, a right triangle has three sides. Two of the sides come together to form the right angle. These
two sides are called legs. The third side of the triangle is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always
the longest side of a right triangle. It is directly across from the right angle. Here are some examples
of right triangles.

A right triangle has two legs. In ΔABC, the legs are A

side and is directly across from the right angle. In ΔABC, the hypotenuse is C

2. Name the legs of ΔHTP.
3. Name the legs of ΔXYZ.
4. Name the hypotenuse in ΔHTP.
 THE PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM
The equation below summarizes the Pythagorean Theorem.
a2 + b2 = c2
In the equation, a and b are the legs of the right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse. In words, the
Pythagorean Theorem says the following:
In a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs is equal to the square of the length of
the hypotenuse.
Let’s see how this works in a few examples.

16 + 9 = c2

So, the length of the hypotenuse is 5.

Let b = the length of L

Let c = the length of H

Step 3: Plug the known lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem.
a2 + b2 = c2
122 + b2 = 152
Step 4: Solve.
122 + b2 =   152
144 + b2 =   225

So the length of the missing leg is 9.
You can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to determine if a
triangle is a right triangle or not. Plug in the lengths of the
sides of a triangle. If a2 + b2 = c2 is true for that triangle,
then you know it’s a right triangle. You must know the
length of all three sides for this to work. You can also mem-
orize some common, small numbered groups of triples (such
as (3, 4, 5); (5, 12, 13), and (9, 12, 15)) to help you solve

Problems
These problems apply the skills you’ve learned in Section 8 to every day situations. As you work
through these problems, you’ll see that the skills you’ve learned in this section aren’t only important
for math tests. They are important skills for the kinds of questions that come up in daily life.
Geometry is logical. When solving a geometry word problem,
always look for logical ways to reason your way through the
problem. Remember, when solving geometry problems, draw-
ing a figure is often the most helpful tool you can use.

9. From the table in Think About It, you know that this angle has four different names as follows:
∠KBT, ∠TBK, ∠B, and ∠2.
10. a.
To measure the angle, begin by placing the cross mark or hole in the middle of the
straight edge of the protractor on angle’s vertex. Then, line up one of the angle’s rays with
one of the zero marks on the protractor. Keeping the protractor in place, trace the length
of the angle’s other ray out to the curved part of the protractor. Read the number on the
protractor closest to the ray. The angle measures 45°.
b. To measure the angle, begin by placing the cross mark or hole in the middle of the
straight edge of the protractor on angle’s vertex. Then, line up one of the angle’s rays with
one of the zero marks on the protractor. Keeping the protractor in place, trace the length
of the angle’s other ray out to the curved part of the protractor. Read the number on the
protractor closest to the ray. The angle measures 75°.
c.
To measure the angle, begin by placing the cross mark or hole in the middle of the
straight edge of the protractor on angle’s vertex. Then, line up one of the angle’s rays with
one of the zero marks on the protractor. Keeping the protractor in place, trace the length
of the angle’s other ray out to the curved part of the protractor. Read the number on the
protractor closest to the ray. The angle measures 100°.
d. To measure the angle, begin by placing the cross mark or hole in the middle of the
straight edge of the protractor on angle’s vertex. Then, line up one of the angle’s rays with
one of the zero marks on the protractor. Keeping the protractor in place, trace the length
of the angle’s other ray out to the curved part of the protractor. Read the number on the

OF. Since →
AO is at 0° and →
OF is at 180°, you know that
∠AOF measures 180°.
c.
Begin by ﬁnding →
BO. Then, ﬁnd →
OD. Since →
BO is at 20° and →
OD is at 100°, you have to
subtract (100 −20 = 80). So ∠BOD measures 80°.
d. Begin by ﬁnding →
CO. Then, ﬁnd →
OE. Since →
CO is at 70° and →
OE is at 135°, you have to
subtract (135 −70 = 65). So ∠COE measures 65°.
12. Begin by looking at the measure of the angle. It’s 89°. From the table, you know that an angle
that measures less than 90° is called an acute angle. So the angle is acute.
13. Begin by looking at the measure of the angle. It’s 180°. From the table, you know that an angle
that measures 180° is called a straight angle. So the angle is straight.
14. Begin by looking at the measure of the angle. From the table, you know that an angle with this
symbol measures 90° and that a 90° angle is called a right angle. So the angle is right.
15. Begin by looking at the measure of the angle. It’s 45°. From the table, you know that an angle

16. Begin by looking at the measure of the angle. It’s 150°. From the table, you know that an angle

18. a.
Interior angles are those inside the parallel lines. There are two sets of parallel lines in the
ﬁgure: a and b and c and d. For lines a and b, the interior angles are 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14,
and 15. For lines c and d, the interior angles are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
b. Exterior angles are those outside the parallel lines. There are two sets of parallel lines in
the ﬁgure: a and b and c and d. For lines a and b, the exterior angles are 1, 5, 9, 13, 4, 8, 12,
and 16. For lines c and d, the exterior angles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 13, 14, 15, and 16.
c.
Corresponding angles on the same side of the transversal line and either both above or
both below the parallel lines. When line a is considered the transversal line, ∠1 corre-
sponds to ∠9. When line c is considered the transversal line, ∠1 corresponds to ∠3.
d. Alternate interior angles are inside the parallel lines and on opposite sides of the transver-
sal line. When line a is considered the transversal line, ∠5 and ∠10 are alternate interior
angles. When line c is considered the transversal line, ∠5 is an exterior angle.
e.
Alternate exterior angles are outside the parallel lines and on opposite sides of the trans-
versal line. When line c is considered the transversal line, ∠5 and ∠4 are alternate exterior
angles. When line a is considered the transversal line, ∠5 is an interior angle.
f.
Vertical angles are directly across or opposite from each other. The ﬁgure includes the fol-
lowing vertical angle pairs: 1 and 6, 2 and 5, 3 and 8, 4 and 7, 9 and 14, 10 and 13, 11 and
16, and 12 and 15.
g.
Supplementary angles add up to 180°. The following angle pairs are supplementary
because together they form a straight line: 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, 7 and 8, 9 and 10, 11
and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, 4 and 8, 9 and 13, 10 and 14, 11
and 15, 12 and 16. The following angle pairs are supplementary because they are same
side interior angles: 5 and 9, 6 and 10, 7 and 11, 8 and 12, 2 and 3, 6 and 7, 10 and 11, 14
and 15. The following angle pairs are supplementary because they are same side exterior
angles: 1 and 13, 2 and 14, 3 and 15, 4 and 16, 1 and 4, 5 and 8, 9 and 12, 13 and 16.
19. You know that ∠12 and ∠16 are supplementary, so together they must add up to 180°. You can
ﬁnd the measure of ∠16 by subtracting the measure of ∠12 from 180. So, 180 −70 = 110. Your
ﬁnal answer is 110°.
20. Begin by ﬁnding an angle that is related to both angles 1 and 4. You know that ∠1 and ∠3 are
congruent because they are corresponding angles. You also know that ∠3 and ∠4 are supple-
mentary because they form a straight line (180°). Then, ﬁnd the measure of the angle that both
angles have in common. You know that ∠1 and ∠3 are congruent. You also know that ∠1 is 120°.
So, ∠3 is also 120°. Lastly, ﬁnd the measure of ∠4 by subtracting: ∠4 = 180° −120° = 60°. So,
your ﬁnal answer is 60°.

 LESSON 19
1. You know that each side of a square is equal. So, if you know that one side of a square is 10 in,
then you know that each side of the square is 10 in. To calculate the perimeter, add up the length
of all four sides: 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 40. So, your ﬁnal answer is 40 in.
2. Add up the four sides: 3 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 16. So, your ﬁnal answer is 16 ft.
3. Add up the lengths of the three sides: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. So, your ﬁnal answer is 12 mm.
4. You are given the radius, so use C = 2πr. Plug in the radius and pi and multiply: (2)(3.14)(5) =
31.4. So, your ﬁnal answer is 31.4 cm.
5. You are given the diameter, so use C = πd. Plug in the diameter and pi and multiply: (3.14)(10)
= 31.4. So, your ﬁnal answer is 31.4 cm.
6. Add up the lengths of each side: 2 + 7 + 7 + 2 + 10 + 10 = 38. So, the perimeter of the ﬁgure is
38 ft.
7. Add up the lengths of each side: 4 + 6 + 2 + 4 + 9 + 5 + 3 = 33. So, the perimeter of the ﬁgure
is 33 m.
8. Begin by calculating the perimeter of the curved side of the ﬁgure. You know that the perime-
ter of the whole circle is 2πr, or (2)(3.14)(8) = 50.24. Remember, it is a quarter circle, so mul-
tiply 50.24 by 1
4
 (or .25) to get 12.56. Both straight edges of the ﬁgure are radii, which you are
told are 8 cm long each. So the total perimeter of the ﬁgure is the curved edge plus the two
straight edges: 12.56 + 8 + 8 = 28.56. The ﬁnal answer is 28.56 cm.
9. Begin by choosing the correct formula. You know this is a triangle, so use A = 1
2
bh. Then, plug
in the numbers and solve for the area of the triangle. The base is 7 cm; the height is 6 cm: A =
1
2
(6)(7) = 21. Write your answer in units squared. So, your ﬁnal answer is 21 cm2.
10. Begin by choosing the correct formula. From the table, you know this is a parallelogram, so
use A = bh. Then, plug in the numbers and solve for the area. The base is 12 mm; the height is
10 mm: A = (10)(12) = 120. Write your answer in units squared. So, your ﬁnal answer is 120
mm2.
11. Begin by choosing the correct formula. You know this is a circle, so use A = πr2. Before you can
solve for the area of the circle, you have to ﬁnd the radius. The diameter is 16 inches, so divide
by 2 to get the radius: 1
2
6 = 8. Then, plug in the radius and solve for the area: A = π(8)2 = 64π.
Use π = 3.14 to get 200.96. Write your ﬁnal answer in units squared. So your ﬁnal answer is
200.96 in2.
12. Begin by choosing the correct formula. From the table you know that this ﬁgure is a trapezoid.
So, you need to use the following formula: A = 1
2
h(b1 + b2). Then, plug in the measures for the
variables in the formula and solve for the missing variable (b1). It’s helpful to ﬁrst eliminate the
parentheses as you learned in the last section.

10 = b1
So, the ﬁnal answer is 10 cm.
13. First, calculate the area of each circle. To calculate the area of circle A, use A = πr2. Plug in the
measure of the radius (2) and solve: A = π(2)2 = 4π. To calculate the area of circle B, again use
A = πr2. Plug in the measure of the radius (3) and solve: A = π(3)2 = 9π. Then, subtract the area
of circle A from the area of circle B: 9π −4π = 5π. Finally, use 3.14 for π: 5π = 15.7. Write the
ﬁnal answer in units squared: 15.7 cm2.
14. The shaded portion of the ﬁgure is the square minus the portion taken up by the circle. So,
you ﬁrst need to calculate the area of the square and the area of the circle. To calculate the area
of the square, use A = bh. You know that the base and the height have the same value in a square
and this will be equal to the diameter of the circle. The radius of the circle is 1, so the diam-
eter of the circle is 2. Thus, the area of the square is (2)(2) = 4. Next, calculate the area of the
circle. Use A = πr2 where r = 1. So, A = π(1)2 = π. The area of the shaded portion of the ﬁgure
is equal to the area of the square (4) minus the area of the circle (π, or 3.14). Written in square
units, the ﬁnal answer is 0.86 ft2.
15. You know that side AB is equal to the diameter of the circle. So begin by calculating the diam-
eter of the circle, using the formula for the area of a circle: 
A = πr2. Plug in the known measures and solve for r.
100π = πr2
100π
π = π
π
r2

100 = r2
To ﬁnd the value of r take the square root of each side: 10 = r. Then, calculate the diameter of
the circle. The diameter is twice the radius, or (2)(10) = 20. So, the ﬁnal answer is 20 cm.
16. Begin by choosing the correct formula. From the table you know that this ﬁgure is a rectan-
gular solid and that the formula for its volume is V = Ah = lwh. Then, plug in the known mea-
sures and solve.
V = Ah = lwh
V = (6)(6)(3)
V = 108

So, the ﬁnal answer is 108 cm3.
17. Begin by choosing the correct formula. From the table you know that this ﬁgure is a rectan-
gular solid and that the formula for its volume is V = Ah = lwh. Then, plug in the known mea-
sures and solve.
V = Ah = lwh
V = (12)(4)(9)
V = 432
So, the ﬁnal answer is 432 in3.
18. Begin by choosing the correct formula. From the table you know that this ﬁgure is a cube and
that the formula for the volume of a cube is V = Ah = s3. Plug in the known measures and solve.
V = Ah = s3
V = 53
V = 5 × 5 × 5
V = 125
So, the ﬁnal answer is 125 m3.
19. Begin by choosing the correct formula. From the table you know that this ﬁgure is a cylinder
and that the formula for its volume is V = Ah = πr2h. Then, plug in the known measures and
solve.
V = πr2h
V = π(3)2(12)
V = π(9)(12)
V = π(108)
V = 339.12
So, the ﬁnal answer is 339.12 m3.
20. The water ﬁlls half the cylinder. So, you could calculate the entire volume of the cylinder and
divide by 2. An easier approach might be to directly calculate the volume of the water. To cal-
culate the volume of the water directly, keep in mind that the height of the volume of the water
(4 cm) should be used instead of the height of the entire cylinder (8 cm). Begin by choosing
the correct formula for the volume of a cylinder: V = Ah = πr2h. Then, plug in the known mea-
sures and solve.
V = πr2h
V = π(5)2(4)
V = π(25)(4)
V = π(100)
V = 314
So, the ﬁnal answer is 314 cm3.

from the symbols on the triangles that
AB


BC
 ≅D
A

In order to prove that the triangles are congruent, you still need one piece of information.
Since both triangles share a side (AC

Side is true, so the two triangles are congruent.

The given information matches the rule for Side-Angle-Side. Since Side-Angle-Side is true,
the two triangles are congruent.
3. Begin by asking yourself: which corresponding parts of the triangles are congruent. You know
from the symbols on the triangles that FG
 ≅IG

∠F ≅∠I
You need to know the measure of ∠1 is congruent to the measure of ∠2. Recall from Lesson
18 that angles directly across from each other (also called vertical angles) are congruent. Using
this information, you know that ∠1 is congruent to ∠2. Since Angle-Side-Angle is true, the
two triangles are congruent.
4. Begin by asking yourself: which corresponding parts of the triangles are congruent. You know
from the symbols on the triangles that 
∠1 ≅∠4
∠3 ≅∠2
In order to prove that the triangles are congruent, you still need one piece of information. Since
both triangles share a side (KM
), this side must also be congruent with itself. Thus, Angle-
Side-Angle is true. The two triangles are congruent.
5. Begin by asking yourself: which corresponding parts of the triangles are congruent. You know
from the symbols on the triangles that W
Z
 ≅Y
Z
. Because the two triangles share a side, you
know this side is congruent with itself. You also know that X
Z
 and ZV
 form a 90° angle, which
is supplementary to the angle formed by X
Z
 and ZW
. So these two angles must also be con-
gruent. Thus, Side-Angle-Side is true. The two triangles are congruent.
6. Begin by asking yourself which corresponding parts of the triangles are likely to be similar. Since
both triangles are right triangles, you know that ∠C ≅∠F. In order for the triangles to be sim-
ilar ∠A ≅∠D and ∠B ≅∠E. Since ∠A is 20° and ∠D is 21°, it’s not possible for these two tri-
angles to be similar. Therefore, the two triangles are not similar.
7. Begin by asking yourself which corresponding parts of the triangles are likely to be similar. You
know from the measurements given that ∠T ≅∠L. From the shapes of the triangles, you know

that RT
 corresponds with M
L
 and ST
 corresponds with L
N
. (Redrawing one of the ﬁgures
would make this easier to see.) Then, ask yourself: if one of the rules needed to prove that two
triangles are similar is met. To ﬁnd out if the sides of the triangles are in proportion, you need
to set up proportions and see if they are true, as shown below.

5  1

0
To test whether the proportion is true, you can cross multiply:
8 × 10  15 × 6
80 ≠90
Because the two sides of the equation are not equal, the sides are not proportional, and Side-
Side-Side is not true. Since none of the rules that prove two triangles are similar are met, the
two triangles are not similar.
8. Begin by asking yourself which corresponding parts of the triangles are likely to be similar. Since
they share ∠I, you know this triangle is congruent. You also know that ∠H ≅∠L and ∠J ≅∠K.
(Remember that corresponding angles formed by a transversal and two parallel lines are con-
gruent.) Because Angle-Angle is true, the two triangles are similar.
9. Begin by asking yourself which corresponding parts of the triangles are likely to be similar. Since
∠1 and ∠2 are vertical angles, you that they are congruent and are both equal to 75°. In order
for the triangles to be similar you have to show that either ∠A ≅∠D or ∠C ≅∠E. Since ∠2 is
75° and ∠D is 20°, you know that ∠C is equal to 85° (180 −75 −20 = 85). This proves that
both ∠A ≅∠D and ∠C ≅∠E. Therefore, the triangles are similar according to Angle-Angle.
10. You know from the problem that the triangles are similar. So you can set up a proportion to
solve for the height of the ﬂagpole.

5. Begin by ﬁnding the legs and the hypotenuse in the right triangle. The legs are D
F
 and FE
.
The hypotenuse is D
E
. Then, match up the variables a, b, and c with the parts of the right tri-
angle. For example, you might 
Let a = the length of D
F
.
Let b = the length of FE
.
Let c = the length of D
E
.
Next, plug the known lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve.
a2 + b2
= c2
82 + 152 = c2
64 + 225 = c2
289         = c2
289

17           = c
So, the length of the hypotenuse is 17.
6. Begin by ﬁnding the legs and the hypotenuse in the right triangle. The legs are JL
 and L
K
.
The hypotenuse is JK
. Then, match up the variables a, b, and c with the parts of the right tri-
angle. For example, you might
Let a = the length of JL
.
Let b = the length of L
K
.
Let c = the length of JK
.
Next, plug the known lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve.
a2 + b2
= c2
a2 + 122 = 152
a2 + 144 = 225
a2 + 144 = 225

7. Begin by ﬁnding the legs and the hypotenuse in the right triangle. The legs are R
T
 and T
S
.
The hypotenuse is RS
. Then, match up the variables a, b, and c with the parts of the right tri-
angle. For example, you might
Let a = the length of R
T
.
Let b = the length of T
S
.
Let c = the length of RS
.
Next, plug the known lengths into the Pythagorean Theorem and solve.
a2 + b2
= c2
62 + b2
= 102
36 + b2
= 100
36 + b2 = 100

So, the length of the missing leg is 8.
8. If the triangle with sides, 5, 6, and 9 is a right triangle, its sides will follow the pattern of the
Pythagorean Theorem, where a2 + b2 = c2, where c is the hyponteneuse. You just need to plug
the given variables into the equation and solve: 
a2 + b2 = 92
52 + 62  92
25 + 36 ≠81
61

= c2

Because the legs do not follow the Pythagorean Theorem, the triangle is not a right triangle.
9. If the triangle with sides 6, 8, and 10 is a right triangle, its sides will follow the pattern of the
Pythagorean Theorem where a2 + b2 = c2, where c is the hypoteneuse. So, you plug the vari-
ables into the equation and see if the math works out.
a2 + b2 = c2
62 + 82  102
36 + 64 = 100
Because the legs follow the Pythagorean Theorem, you know that it’s a right triangle.
10. If the triangle with sides 3, 5, and 9 is a right triangle, its sides will follow the pattern of the

 REAL WORLD PROBLEMS
1. Begin by determining what you need to ﬁnd out. The performance area will form a rectangle.
The ribbon will outline the rectangle, so you need to ﬁnd the perimeter of the performance
area. To ﬁnd the perimeter of the rectangle, add up the lengths of the four sides: 34 + 20 + 34
+ 20 = 108. So, 108 feet of ribbon will be needed.
2. Begin by calculating the perimeter of the room. Since the room is a square, you can calculate
its perimeter using the formula 4s, where s = the length of one side of the room, or 9 feet. So,
the perimeter is 4 × 9 = 36 feet long. Bridget will need three garlands to cover the perimeter
of the room because 2 garlands (2 × 15 = 30) will be too short. Your ﬁnal answer is three gar-
lands.
3. Begin by visualizing the situation. The ponies walk in a circle. The radius of the circle is equal
to the length of the wheel spoke, or 10 meters. So, ﬁrst you need to calculate the perimeter, or
circumference, of the circle that the pony walks in one turn of the wheel. The formula for the
circumference of a circle is C = 2πr. Plug in the numbers and multiply: C =(2)(3.14)(10) = 62.8.
Now you are ready to calculate the distance a pony travels in one ride: (3)(62.8) = 188.4. So,
one pony ride is 188.4 meters long.
4. Begin by calculating the area of the walls that needs to be covered. First, calculate the area of
the walls. The room has four walls, each 12 feet long and 10 feet tall, so the area of each wall
is 120 square feet (10 × 12 = 120). There are four walls, so the area of all four walls is 480 square
feet (4 × 120 = 480). Only the walls will be covered with wallpaper, so you need to subtract the
area that the window and the door take up in the room. The window takes up 12 square feet
(3 × 4 = 12). The door takes up 21 square feet (3 × 7 = 21). So, the total area that Louise needs
to cover with wallpaper is 480 −12 −21 = 447 square feet. Since each roll of wallpaper covers
100 square feet, she will need to buy ﬁve rolls of wallpaper.
5. Think about which area formula will work in this problem. The problem tells you the radius,
which gives you the clue that you are looking for the area of a circle. The formula for the area
of a circle is A = r2. So, plug in the numbers and solve: 
A = πr2
= (3.14)(45)2
= (3.14)(2,025)
= 6,358.5

So, the total search area is 6,358.5 square miles.
6. The sidewalk is a rectangular solid and you are asked to determine its length. You know that
the length is six times longer than the width. Let x = the width of the sidewalk. Then, use the
formula for the volume of a rectangular solid to solve for the sidewalk’s length. The formula
for the volume of a rectangular solid is V = Ah = lwh. So,
V = Ah = lwh
27 = (6x)(x)(0.5)
27 = (6x2)(0.5)
2
3
7 = 3
3
x2

9 = x2
3 = x
This tells you that the width of the sidewalk is 3 feet. The length of the sidewalk is six times
longer, or 18 feet long (3 × 6 = 18). So, your ﬁnal answer is 18 feet long.
7. You are looking for the volume of a rectangular solid. The formula for the volume of a rec-
tangular solid is V = Ah = lwh. The length is 10 minus 2 inches on each side, or 10 − 4 = 6 inches
long. The width is 7 inches minus 2 inches on each side, or 7 −2 −2 = 3. The height is 2 inches.
V = Ah = lwh
= (6)(3)(2)
= (18)(2)
= 36
So, the box’s volume is 36 cubic inches.
8. Begin by calculating the volume of each box shown. Both boxes are rectangular solids. The for-
mula for the volume of a rectangular solid is V = Ah = lwh. To calculate the volume of the smaller
box, plug in the dimensions shown in the ﬁgure.
V = Ah = lwh
= (20)(18)(16)
= (360)(16)
= 5,760
So, the box’s volume is 5,760 cubic inches.
To calculate the volume of the larger box, add 2 inches to each dimension shown in the ﬁg-
ure.
V = Ah = lwh
= (22)(20)(18)
= (440)(18)
= 7,920
So, the box’s volume is 7,920 cubic inches.

The difference in the two volumes is 2,160 cubic inches (7,920 −5,760 = 2,160). So your ﬁnal
answer is 2,160 cubic inches greater storage volume.
9. The distances given form a right triangle, so you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve
for the missing distance. The missing distance will form the hypotenuse of the triangle because
it comes directly across from the right angle. So, plug the variables into the equation and solve
for c: 
a2 + b2
= c2
602 + 802
= c2
3,600 + 6,400 = c2
10,000           = c2
10,000

= c2

100                = c
So, a direct route from Plattville to Quincy is 100 miles.
10. The distances form a right triangle, so you can use the Pythagorean Theorem (a2 + b2 = c2).
The distance from Macy to the rock wall is 120 m, so a = 120. The hypotenuse of the triangle
in the diagram is 241 m, so c = 241. Using these values yields the equation 14,400 + b2 = 58,081. 
Now, solve the equation for b: 
b2 =   58,081
−14,400
b2 =   43,681
Then, you take the square root of both sides: b2
 = 43,681

So, your ﬁnal answer is b = 209. The climber was 209 meters off the ground.

1. a.
You know that you need to multiply three dimensions to get the volume of something, so
you multiply the numbers in the answer choices together in order to see which number
matches Pedro’s answer. You can begin by multiplying each set of dimensions given in the
answer choices: Choice a is: 2.7 ft × 2.9 ft × 4 ft, which equals 31.32 ft3. Since answer
choice a matches the volume given in the question, you don’t need to multiply the other
answer choices. If you missed this question, you might want to review Lesson 19.
2. c.

Then, use the following equation to solve the problem: Whole × Percent = Part. Plug in
the parts of the equation that you know: Part = 30 × 4.00 = 120. The answer is 120. If you
missed this question, you might want to review Lesson 10.
9. b. According to the graph, 15% of the total monthly expenses goes toward Liam’s car, so you
need to ﬁnd 15% of $2,000. Fifteen percent is equal to 0.15 and of means to multiply: 0.15
× 2,000 = 300. So, Liam spends $300 on his car each month. If you missed this question,
you might want to review Lesson 14.
10. d. Break the math symbols down as follows:
So, the answer is eight less than three times a number is 25. If you missed this question,
you might want to review Lessons 16 and 17.
11. b. Begin by letting x = the number you are looking for. Then, set up an algebraic equation
and solve for x. From the problem, you know that ﬁrst 5 is subtracted from the number,
then 13 is subtracted from the number, so your equation should be:
x −5 −13 = 41
First, you combine like terms.
x −18 = 41
Then, you add 18 to each side of the equation and solve for x:
3x − 8 = 25
eight less than
three times
a number
equals 25
