Ways on Becoming Successful
This practice workbook is designed to work best when it’s paired together
with my video course “The Complete Course on Math Fundamentals” to
help you succeed in Pre-Algebra and Math Fundamentals.   You can use
this book as a solo practice workbook for math fundamentals or for middle
school math or to get ready for high school math but to get the most from
this book,  I would highly recommend you to do the following 5 things:
Step 1) Sign up for my “The Complete Course On Math
Fundamentals” on Udemy because this video course is created with over
25+ hours of videos that I teach, explain and go over thoroughly the
exact questions, topics, quizzes, and final exam that are in this practice
workbook- Step by Step on Videos!
In the videos, I explain important vocabularies and definitions for you
to know.  Then I also explain the concepts of each topic and work out
example problems, step by step, as I go along  for each sections in this
practice workbook.  And if you're stuck on any question in the course and
don't know how to work it out, there are videos of me working out ALL
of the EVEN questions for this practice workbook (that is over 500
Even Questions!) along with videos of me working out ALL of the
questions for the quizzes and also for the final.  So this means that in
this course, I'll be with you every step of the way.
Also, inside the videos, you’ll find tips, tricks, strategies that I have
developed over many years and I have taught and they had helped
thousands of my students.  These tips will help you memorize vocabularies
faster, understand math better, and solve questions quicker and
easier.    Also, Udemy often has a sale every month so you can usually find
the price of my course for less than the price of a meal.  Here’s the link to
sign up Click Here.
Step 2) Practice by doing all of the practice questions in the book. 
There are over 1000 practice questions (along with answers for each.)  I've
been doing math for over twenty years, and every day I still have to review
math or else I'd forget.  Math is like a muscle, the more you practice the 
more you begin to see how certain patterns come together and the quicker
you'll be able to solve the questions.  It's like working out - if you watch

someone else working out, you would not become fit and you would
not have muscle.  If you want to improve, you cannot just watch me do it. 
You also have to do it.  
Step 3) Review.  For every problem in this course, an answer will be
provided in the answer key.  There are over 1000 questions and over 1000
answers, an answer is provided for every single question.
You should check your answer with mine to see if you got the right
answer. 
Step 4) Write down notes into your notebook.  Any vocabularies,
definitions, concepts, or example problems that you think are important,
you can write them down or print them out.  And you can also get a
calculator to double check your answer.
Step 5) Review your math every day.  The amount of time that you need
to review is based on how strong is your current math skills.  I would
recommend you to take about 15-20 minutes a day to review math. If
you're already strong in math  you can review less, if you're new or haven't
taken math in a while, you might want to spend more time, like 25-
30minutes a day or so, until you feel more comfortable with math.
Those are the 5 things to help you get the best out of this course.  If you
follow them, by the time you're done with this course, you'll understand
math much better and become much stronger in math.  Thank you and I
hope you’ll enjoy the course.

Tips and Strategies
Invisible 1 in Front:   When there’s no number in front of a
variable (any letter in the alphabet) then there would be an
invisible 1 in front of it.
Example:     A  is same as:    1A
So for example if the direction tells you to simplify  A + 2A
then to do it we put an invisible 1 in front of A, we’ll get:        
1A + 2A = 3A
The answer is 3A.
2ND example:
Simplify B + 5B .
To do it we put an invisible 1 in front of B, we’ll get: 1B + 5B 
= 6B
The answer is 6B.
Invisible 1 Under:  When there’s no number underneath a
variable or number, there would be an invisible 1 under it.
Ex: A is same as   
and B is same as   and 5 is same as    
Strategies:   Group like things (things that share common

characteristics) together.
Example:
Simplify  4A + 2A + 3B + 5B
Step 1)  Look to see what they have in common and group
them together.  For example the 4A and 2A are similar
because they both have the letter A behind them.  While 3B
and 5B is similar because they both share the same letter B
behind them. So group 4A with 2A and 3B with 5B.
Step 2) Do the operations after you group them.
4A + 2A + 3B + 5B
6A + 8B
Step 3) Since 6A and 8B have different variable (letter)
behind them (one is letter A the other is letter B) you cannot
combine them together.  You just leave it like it is.
So answer is  6A + 8B.

Ratio Notes
A ratio is used to compare two or more things.  We
write ratio in simplest form. 
Ratio can be written in regular (proper) fraction format
(ex:  )
Ratio can also be written in improper fraction format
(ex: )
However, Ratio cannot be written in Mixed Number format.
(ex:  1 )
A rate is a ratio of two unlike things.  A
rate is also known as a unit rate because it’s often be
simplified to a “per unit” form (meaning: something

over 1) For example: A new car gets 30 mile per
gallon.  This is a rate of 30 miles for 1 gallon.  Also
known as unit rate.

A unit rate is when the denominator of a rate is 1.   For
example.  If you drive 60miles per hour.  This is a unit rate
because the denominator is 1. It can be written in fraction form
as  
. “Per” “Every” and“each” is another word for “1”. 
Find the unit rate.

FOIL is a technique for getting polynomials through the multiplication of
binomials.  FOIL is an acronym for First, Outer, Inner, and Last.  First
represent the multiplication of the terms which appear first in the
binomials.  Outer represents the multiplication of the outermost terms. 
Inner represents the multiplication of the very interior terms.  Last
represent the multiplication of the last term of each binomials.   
Simplify each expression:  (5a + 2)(6a – 4)   =
             5a(6a) + 5a(-4) + 2(6a) + 2(-4)  =   Answer = 30
