About the Author
Dirk Zeller, who as an agent rose to the top of the real estate field quickly,
has been on a meteoric rise since he began his career in 1990.
Throughout his sales career, Dirk was recognized numerous times as one of
the leading agents in North America. He has been described by industry
insiders as the most successful agent in terms of high production with life
balance. His ability to sell more than 150 homes annually, while only working
Monday through Thursday and taking Friday, Saturday, and Sunday off
weekly, is legendary in the real estate field.
Dirk turned his selling success into coaching significance through founding
Real Estate Champions. Real Estate Champions is the premier coaching com-
pany in the real estate industry with clients worldwide. Dirk’s clients average
more than a $200,000 increase in their income annually. Dirk has created such
revolutionary programs as “Protect Your Commission,” “Stewardship Selling,”
“The Champion Listing Agent,” and “Positioning Yourself as the Expert.”
These programs and others like them have changed the lives of hundreds of
thousands of real estate agents worldwide.
Dirk is one of the most published authors in the areas of success, life balance,
sales training, and business development in the real estate field. He has more
than 250 published articles to his credit. His weekly Coaches Corner newslet-
ter is read by over 200,000 subscribers each week. His book Your First Year 
in Real Estate (Prima Publishing) has sold just shy of 100,000 copies in just a
few years.
Dirk is also one of the most sought-after speakers in the real estate arena. 
He has spoken to agents and managers at the local, regional, national, and
international level for most of the large real estate brands, such as Coldwell
Banker, RE/MAX, Century 21, ERA, and Prudential. He has shared the stage
with such notable speakers as Zig Ziglar, Brian Tracy, and Les Brown.
Besides contributing to the real estate agent community, Dirk and his wife of
16 years, Joan, are very active in their church. They live with their 4-year-old
son, Wesley, and 8-month-old daughter, Annabelle, in Bend, Oregon.


Dedication
So many people have contributed to my success in life, from my parents to
my two brothers, my mentors and coaches, and now my two children, Wesley
and Annabelle. No one, however, has contributed to my success in the real
estate field more than my wife, Joan. I dedicate this book to her: my supporter,
encourager, coach, role play partner, accountability partner, and best friend.
The success that has been achieved in real estate sales, writing, speaking,
training, and coaching was achieved only through our partnership. We did it
together! Some 16 years later, I’m still amazed at God’s grace in giving me a
wife without compare.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Just as a successful business is always a collaborative effort, so is a book.
While I receive the unfair lion’s share of the credit, countless others are
behind the scenes making me look good.
To Barbara Schenck, who took my experiences, strategies, thoughts, and
techniques and put them into the Dummies format you enjoy, thank you. This
book would not exist without your enduring effort and patience.
To the team at Real Estate Champions, an incredible group of people who
change people’s lives each day, you are the best. Thank you to our support
staff of Judy Cox and Julie Porfirio whose loyalty all these years means so
much to me and to Luci Hamilton and Mary Stewart whose passion to serve
others is unparalleled. A special thanks to Rachelle Cotton who arduously
read every unreadable handwritten word and typed, corrected, and revised
the whole manuscript while enduring every last-minute induced deadline . . .
Thanks.
To our coaches and salespeople who really change the lives of everyone they
touch; to our marketing staff of Dan Matejsek and Shaylor Murray; everyone
at Real Estate Champions had a hand in this book.
I also need to thank the team at Wiley. Tracy Boggier, acquisition editor,
Chrissy Guthrie, project editor, Jessica Smith, copy editor, and the Composi-
tion Department. You are truly pros at what you do. I also want to thank Ken
Edwards, technical reviewer, as well as my literary agent, Barry Neville, of
The Neville Agency.
Lastly, I must thank my personal clients and our Real Estate Champions
clients. With you constantly challenging us and wanting passionately to
improve, you drive us to work so hard to stay ahead. It would be easy to
become complacent, but you don’t let us. Thanks!

Success as a Real Estate Agent For Dummies

Introduction
W
elcome! You’re about to move into the league of the most successful
real estate agents.
Real estate sales is the greatest business in the world. In my more than 20
years as a business owner and entrepreneur, I’ve yet to find a business equal
to real estate sales when it comes to income potential versus capital invest-
ment. In any marketplace, a real estate agent has the opportunity to create
hundreds of thousands of dollars in income. (I coach many agents who earn
more than one million dollars per year.) An agent’s income is especially sig-
nificant when viewed against the capital investment required by the business.
Most agents need as little as $2,000 to start up their practices. Compare that
to any other business and you’ll find that most involve sizeable investments
and burdensome loans to buy equipment, lease space, create marketing
pieces, develop business strategies, and hire employees — all to achieve
what is usually a smaller net profit than what a real estate agent can achieve
in the first few years. It’s almost too good to be true!
Real estate sales paved the way for me to become a millionaire at a very
young age. It has provided a solid income, many investment opportunities, an
exciting lifestyle, and a platform from which I’ve been able to help many
others achieve their own goals and dreams in life.
About This Book
This book is about becoming a successful real estate agent, for sure. It’s also
about acquiring sales skills, marketing skills, time-management skills, people
skills, and business skills. It’s about gaining more respect, achieving more
recognition, making more money, and closing more sales. It’s a guide that
helps you achieve the goals and dreams that you have for yourself and your
family.
I’m delighted to share with you the keys I’ve found for real estate success and
to allow you to learn from the mistakes I’ve made along the way. (I’m a firm
believer in the idea that we often learn more from failures than successes,
but that doesn’t mean you have to repeat my failures.)

The techniques, skills, and strategies I present throughout this book are the
same ones I’ve used and tested to perfection personally and with thousands
of coaching clients and hundreds of thousands of training program partici-
pants. This book is not a book of theory but of “real stuff” that works and is
laid out in a hands-on, step-by-step format. You can also find time-tested
scripts in most sales-oriented chapters. The scripts are designed to move
prospects and clients to do more business with you. (If you’re a junior
member of the grammar police, you may find that some don’t perfectly align
with your expectation of the English language. The objective of sales scripts,
though, is not perfect sentence structure but rather maximum persuasion of
the prospect or client.)
If you apply the information contained in this book with the right attitude,
and if you’re consistent in your practices and in your success expectations,
your success in real estate sales is guaranteed.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book I’ve incorporated a number of style conventions, most
aimed at keeping the book easy to read and a few aimed at keeping it legally
accurate:
 Throughout this book, I use the term real estate agent rather than Realtor
unless I’m talking specifically about members of the National Association
of Realtors (NAR). Realtor is a registered trademark owned by the NAR,
which requires that the term appear either in all capital letters or with
an initial capital R. For your information, all Realtors are real estate
agents, but only those real estate agents who are members of and sub-
scribe to the Association’s strict code of ethics are Realtors.
 The word agency describes the relationship that a real estate agent has
with members of the public, or as they’re sometimes called, clients. When
clients list a home for sale, they enter a contractual relationship with the
agent who will represent their interests. That agreement is called an
agency relationship. Every state and province has a unique set of laws
stipulating how consumers and real estate agents work in an agency rela-
tionship. These agency laws have been reworked and clarified over the
past decade. In earlier days, agents didn’t formally represent homebuy-
ers. Instead, agents were obligated solely to the sellers, for whom they
worked basically as sub-agents. That’s all ancient history, though, and
throughout this book when I refer to agency agreements, I’m describing
the real estate agent’s relationship with buyers or sellers, depending
upon whether the agent is the listing agent or the selling agent.
 Bulleted and numbered lists present important information in a quick-
skim format. Watch for lists marked by numbers or checkmarks. They
contain essential facts, steps to take, or advice to follow.
2
Success as a Real Estate Agent For Dummies 

 Whenever I introduce a new term, I italicize it and follow it up with a
brief definition.
 Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont to make them stand
out on the page.
What You’re Not to Read
Personally, I think you should read every word of this book. (I wrote it, after
all!) However, if you’re the bare-bones info type, you can skip the sidebars
that appear throughout the book. You know when you come upon a sidebar
because it appears in a gray box. The sidebars contain interesting, often
anecdotal, information that’s related to the topic but not essential to under-
standing it.
Foolish Assumptions
As I compressed a career’s worth of real estate experience and coaching
advice into these pages, I had to make the following assumptions about you,
the reader:
 You’re already a licensed real estate agent. If you haven’t yet taken the
real estate license exam, consider the book Real Estate License Exams
For Dummies by John A. Yoegel (Wiley).
 You’re looking to rev up your real estate business, whether you’re just
starting out or have been in the business for a while. Some of you may
be deciding whether to specialize in commercial or residential real
estate and may be considering which real estate company to join.
Others have already launched careers, hung licenses with good compa-
nies, and are now looking for advice on how to climb the success curve
faster and higher. Still others are interested in refining specific skills,
such as prospecting, selling, running their businesses more efficiently, or
building customer loyalty.
How This Book Is Organized
Each of the five parts of this book deals with a different aspect of your real
estate career: making fundamental career decisions, attracting clients, clos-
ing sales, building a strong business, and tapping into the best resources and
advice available.
3
Introduction

Every part of the book is a self-standing component. You can scan the table
of contents and flip directly to the chapter or section that addresses your
interests, or you can search the index and go straight to specific pages that
answer your questions. I think you can benefit the very most by reading the
entire book, but you don’t have to read it sequentially from cover-to-cover to
make sense of the contents.
Part I: Acquiring the Keys 
to Real Estate Success
The four chapters in this first part pave the way for your real estate success.
The first chapter provides an overview of the skills you need, gives advice 
for acquiring expertise, and shows what steps to take to swing the odds for
success your way. The second chapter helps you understand and decide
between residential and commercial specialties. Chapter 3 guides you
through the process of evaluating, choosing, and joining a real estate com-
pany. And Chapter 4 helps you research and understand the marketplace in
which you are working.
Part II: Prospecting For Buyers and Sellers
This five-chapter part unlocks the secrets of client development. It starts
with a chapter dedicated to how, when, and why to prospect. Following chap-
ters focus on how to mine gold from referrals, how to win business from
expired and FSBO listings, how to use open houses as the ultimate prospect-
ing approach and, finally, how to convert all that prospecting effort to sales
action by perfecting your skills at presenting and closing contracts.
Part III: Developing a Winning 
Sales Strategy
This part is all about sales. It begins with a chapter that helps you establish a
home’s ideal sales price based on current market conditions, your own pric-
ing philosophy, and what I call my magic marketing formula. The next chap-
ter is about getting the house ready to show. It’s followed by an essential
chapter on how to market properties online and in print. The part ends with
an important chapter on how to negotiate contracts and close deals.

Part IV: Running a Successful 
Real Estate Business
In this part, I go into coaching mode and help you position yourself for suc-
cess. The first of the three chapters in this part gives you tools, systems,
strategies and techniques to understand your marketplace and define where
you stand in it, and stake your own competitive position. In the second chap-
ter, I share advice for building client relationships, developing client loyalty,
delivering unbeatable service, and winning client relationships that last a life-
time. This part ends with an invaluable chapter that is packed full of how-to
techniques and advice for generating the greatest return on the time you
invest in your real estate career.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This final part sends you off with four fast ten-part lists. Chapter 17 presents
ten tools that are essential for any real estate agent’s success. Chapter 18 is a
round up of top ten tips for working with buyers. Chapter 19 tells you how to
avoid the ten big real estate sales mistakes. Finally, Chapter 20 closes the book
with ten great Web sites to click on for a wealth of additional information.
Icons Used in This Book
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without the handy symbols that sit in
the outer margin to alert you to valuable information and advice. Watch for
these icons:

Where to Go from Here
The beauty of this book is that you can start wherever makes most sense 
for you.
If you’re a newcomer to the field of real estate sales, I suggest you start with
Part I, in which I’ve consolidated all the start-up information that you’re likely
to be looking for.
If you’ve been in the trenches for a while and simply aren’t having as much
success as you’d like, start with Chapter 5 and go from there.
If you’re time-pressed, facing a crucial issue, or grappling with a particular
problem or question, turn to the table of contents or index to find exactly the
advice you’re seeking.
Wherever you start, get out a pad of yellow sticky notes or a highlighter pen

Chapter 1
Discovering the Skills 
of a Successful Agent
In This Chapter
 Defining financial success
 Understanding the role and importance of a professional real estate agent
 Knowing the importance of customer creation and sales skills
 Choosing the right path to real estate success
E
ach agent defines success slightly differently. Some agents set their goals
in dollars, some are attracted to the opportunity to be their own bosses
and build their own businesses, and some want the personal control and free-
dom that a real estate career allows. Achieving success, however, requires the
same basic fundamentals regardless of what motivates your move into real
estate. Agents who build successful businesses share four common attributes:
 They’re consistent. They perform success-producing activities day in and
day out. Rather than working in spurts — making 50 prospecting calls in
two days and then walking away from the phone for two weeks — they
proceed methodically and steadily, day-after-day, to achieve their goals.
 They believe in the law of accumulation. The law of accumulation is
the principle that says with constant effort everything in life, whether
positive or negative, compounds itself over time. No agent becomes an
overnight success, but with consistency, success-oriented activities
accumulate momentum and power and lead to success every time.
 They’re life-long learners. The most successful agents never quit
improving. Their passion for improvement is acute, and they commit the
time, resources, and energy it takes to constantly enhance their skills
and performance.
 They’re self-disciplined. They have the ability to motivate themselves
to do the activities that must be done. A successful agent shows up daily
for work and puts in a full day of work on highly productive actions such
as prospecting and lead follow-up. They make themselves do things that
they don’t want to do so they can have things in life that they truly want.

You’re already on the road to real estate success, demonstrated by the fact that
you’ve picked up this book to discover what it takes to become a great agent.
This first chapter sets you on your way to success by providing an overview of
the key skills that successful real estate agents pursue and possess.
Having a Financial Goal
One of the first steps toward success is knowing what you want out of your
real estate career. However, “financial independence” is not a specific-enough
answer.
I’ve been in real estate, either in direct sales or teaching, speaking, training,
writing, or coaching people, for nearly 20 years. I’ve met tens of thousands of
agents and nearly every one started selling real estate with the same goal of
financial independence. Countless times I’ve asked the question: “Tell me, how
do you define financial independence?” What I usually hear in response is some
variation of the answer, “So I don’t have to worry about money anymore.”
The key to eliminating money worries is establishing a financial goal — an
actual number — that you need to accumulate in order to achieve the quality
of life you want to enjoy. Financial independence boils down to a number. Set
that number in your mind and then launch your career with the intention to
achieve your goal by a specific date.
10
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 
My own auspicious beginning
As an original dummy in real estate sales, I’m
the perfect author for this book. On my very first
listing presentation, I went to the wrong house.
Can you imagine arriving at the wrong address
for your first presentation? The worst part is that
the man who answered the door let me in. To
this day, I’m not sure why he let me in and let me
begin my listing presentation. I was nearly
halfway through my presentation before I fig-
ured out the mistake! He just sat quietly listen-
ing to me talk about listing his home. He actually
did have an interest in selling his home in the
near future, so he just listened. I finally realized
I was in the wrong house when I glanced over
and saw the address on a piece of mail on 
the table. I had transposed a number on the
address, which put me in the wrong house. All
the while, the real seller was waiting for me
down the street. The good news was that I suc-
cessfully listed the man’s home a few months
later.
In the end, it really doesn’t matter where you
start in your career or what mistakes you make
in the early stages. Everyone makes mistakes in
new endeavors. What matters most is having a
plan or process that keeps you moving down
the track toward your goals. Most people would
have quit with such a rocky start as mine.
However, the sure way to lose is to quit. The
only way you win is to keep going.

By having your financial goal in mind, you find clarity and can see past the
hard work that lies ahead of you. When you have to endure the rejection,
competition, disloyal customers, and challenges that are inevitable along the
way, your knowledge about the wealth you’re working to achieve helps you
weather the storms of the business.
Acting and Working Like a 
Top-Level Professional
Real estate agents join doctors, dentists, attorneys, accountants, and finan-
cial planners in the ranks of licensed professionals that provide guidance and
counsel to clients. The big difference is that most real estate agents don’t
view themselves as top-level professionals. Many agents, and a good portion
of the public, perceive themselves as real estate tour guides, as home inven-
tory access providers, or even as just necessary cogs in the wheel of the
property sale transaction. The best agents, however, know and act differently.
Real estate agents are fiduciary representatives and financial advisors — 
not people paid to unlock front doors of houses for prospective buyers. A
fiduciary is someone who is hired to represent the interests of another. A 
fiduciary owes another person a special relationship of honesty, commit-
ment, exclusivity in representation, ethical treatment, and protection. Build
your real estate business with a strong belief in the service and benefits you
provide your clients, and you’ll provide a vital professional service while
being recognized as the valuable professional you are.
Serving as a fiduciary representative
Real estate agents represent the interests of their clients. As an agent, you’re
bound by honor, ethics, and duty to work on your client’s behalf to achieve
the defined and desired results. This involves the following functions:
 Defining the client’s objective. To serve as a good fiduciary representa-
tive, you need to start with a clear understanding of the objectives your
client is aiming to achieve through the sale or purchase of property. Too
many agents get into trouble by starting out with uncertainty about the
interests of the people they’re representing. To avoid this pitfall, turn to
Chapter 9 for advice and a questionnaire you can use when interviewing
and qualifying prospects.
 Delivering counsel. In the same way that attorneys counsel clients on
the most cost-effective way to proceed legally, it’s your job to offer simi-
larly frank counsel so that your clients reach the real estate outcomes
they seek.
11
Chapter 1: Discovering the Skills of a Successful Agent

An attorney may encourage a client to proceed with a lawsuit when the
client has a high probability of winning, or she may recommend an out-
of-court settlement when odds point toward a court loss that could
leave the client with nothing but legal bills to pay. Likewise, you need to
be able to steer your clients toward good decisions regarding the value
of their homes, the pricing strategies they adopt, the marketing
approaches they follow, and the way their contract is negotiated in
order to maximize their financial advantage. The chapters in Part III of
this book help you develop the knowledge you need in these areas.
 Diagnosing problems and offering solutions. A good agent, like a good
doctor, spends a great deal of time examining situations, determining
problems, and prescribing solutions. In an agent’s case, the focus is on
the condition and health of the home a client is trying to buy or sell. The
examination involves an analysis of the property’s condition, location,
neighborhood, school district, street appeal, landscaping, market com-
petitiveness, market demand, availability for showing, and value versus
price. The diagnosis involves an unvarnished analysis of what a home is
worth and what changes or corrections are necessary.
Some say that agents should present all of the options available to their
clients and then should recommend the course of action that they feel is
best. By doing this, agents allow their clients to make the final decision.
While many experts praise the virtues of this approach, I prefer the diag-
nostic and prescriptive approach because it positions you better as the
expert. When clients make poor choices such as setting the wrong price
on their home or making an initial offer that is too low, you may still
receive some or all of the blame even though you were merely giving
them options and they chose the wrong one.
Many agents get into trouble because they lack the conviction to tell
clients the truths they don’t want to hear. If a home is overpriced or not
ready for showing, or if an offer is too low for seller consideration, it’s
the agent’s job to speak up with sound advice. In these situations, you
could get blamed for a poor outcome. You may also run the risk of doing
all this work and not getting compensated for the time you invested.
To prepare yourself for the task, flip to Chapter 10, which helps you
determine and advise sellers regarding a home’s ideal price, Chapter 11,
which helps you counsel clients regarding changes they need to make
before showing their property, and Chapter 13, which helps you counsel
clients through the final purchase or sale negotiation.
 Troubleshooting. Unavoidably, many times as an agent, you have to be
the bearer of bad news. Market conditions may shift and the price on a
seller’s home may need to come down. A buyer may need to sweeten ini-
tial offers to gain seller attention. A loan request may be rejected, or, you
may need to confront sellers because the animal smells in their home
may be turning buyers away. Or, a home that buyers really wanted may
end up selling to someone else. 
12
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

At times like these, your calm attitude, solution-oriented approach, and
strong agent-client relationship will win the day. Chapter 15 is full of
advice for achieving and maintaining the kind of relationship excellence
that smoothes your transactions and leads to long-lasting and loyal
clients.
Guiding financial decisions
When you help clients make real estate decisions, your advice has a long-last-
ing effect on your clients’ financial health and wealth.
In most cases, home equity is the single largest asset that people own. Your
ability to guide clients to properties that match their needs and desires, that fit
within their budgets, and that will give them long-term gain from minimal initial
investment will impact their financial health and wealth for years to come.
Your influence as a wealth advisor reaches far beyond clients who are in a
position to own investment real estate. In your early years, many of your
clients may be first-time buyers who are taking their first steps into the world
of major financial transactions. Advise them well and they’ll remain clients
and word-of-mouth ambassadors for years to come. See Chapter 15 for more
information about keeping clients for life.
Avoiding the role of a home
inventory access provider
Back in the days of the early 1990s, before the advances of the Internet, the
consumer’s only avenue to information about homes for sale was through a
real estate agent. Every other week, agents received phonebook-sized period-
icals presenting information on properties for sale, with each new entry
accompanied by a small, grainy, black and white picture.
Today, consumers can go online instead of going to a real estate office to
launch their real estate searches. With a few keystrokes and mouse clicks,
they have access to a greatly expanded version of the kind of information
that agents used to control. However, once consumers discover a home they
want to see, they must contact either the owner or an agent to gain inside
access. This is where things get tricky.
Often a consumer signs off the Web and contacts an agent to get inside the
home, as if the agent is simply an entry device. As an agent, you need to
demonstrate special skills to first qualify the consumer’s interest and ability
to buy and then to convert the inquiry into a committed buyer client for your
business. Chapter 18 gives you ten quick tips to adopt when working with
buyers.
13
Chapter 1: Discovering the Skills of a Successful Agent

Winning Customers
Imagine you’re on the game show, Jeopardy, and you’re given seconds to pro-
vide the most important response of your career. Imagine that you’re asked
to write down the question that prompts the answer: The function that makes
or breaks a real estate agent’s success. (If this book contained music, you
know what tune would be playing right now.) Okay, time’s up. How did you
respond?
The moneymaking reply is: What is creating customers? How did you score?
Did you answer: What is customer service? If so, you gave the same answer
that more than 95 percent of new agents give. In fact, more than 90 percent of
experienced agents don’t win points with their answers, either. Only a rare,
few agents see customer creation as the golden approach that it is.
Understanding the importance of customer
creation over customer service
Before you put down this book or send me a note of protest about the title of
this section, understand this caveat: You have to be excellent at customer
development and customer service. However, in terms of priority, you have
to be exemplary at client creation. Following are a few reasons:
14
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 
Agents as necessary evils: A mindset 
that comes and goes
The mindset that agents are overpaid and
unnecessary to the real estate sale process
takes hold of consumers every now and then.
This mindset gains momentum especially when
a robust market leads to low home inventories
and the quick sale of homes that often receive
multiple offers during the short time they’re on
the market.
When times are booming, a segment of con-
sumers and new homebuilders begin to ques-
tion the value of the agent’s services against the
associated fees. During the best of market
times, some homebuilders even go so far as 
to sell their houses without allowing agent 
representation — or compensation.
The silver lining is that when times are good, so
many properties are moving that the few listings
affected by the agent-is-unnecessary mindset
hardly limit opportunity. Plus, booms don’t last
forever. When the market swings back to neu-
tral, you can bet that competition for buyers will
again intensify, inventory levels will expand,
days on the market will lengthen, and sellers —
including homebuilders — will start courting
and even listing with agents again.

 You can’t serve customers if you don’t create customers in the first
place. And because customer service excellence results from customer
service experience, customer development is a necessary prerequisite
to outstanding customer service.
 Most consumers have been provided such poor service that their
expectations are remarkably low. When service providers do what they
said they’d do in the time frame that they agreed to do it, consumers are
generally content with the service they receive. Certainly you want to
develop the kind of expertise that delivers exemplary, outstanding ser-
vice, but if you commit, from the get-go, to do what you said you’d do
when you said you’d do it, your delivery will be better than most.
 Between creating customers and delivering service, customer creation
is the more complex task. Customer creation requires sales skills and
ongoing, consistent, and persistent prospecting for clients. To develop
customers, you have to gain the level of skill and comfort necessary to
pick up the phone and call people you know (or even people you don’t
know) to ask them for the opportunity to do business with them or to
refer you to others who may be in the market for your service.
 If you attract the right kinds of customers into your business, your
clients will match well with your expertise and abilities, and service
will become an easier and more natural offering. If you attract the
right type of customers, you’ll also reap greater quantity and quality of
referrals.
 The only alternative to devoting your time and energy to customer
development is to guide people to your Web site, office, or phone line
through costly advertising and promotional programs. This approach
requires a lot of money and often generates low-quality and reduced-profit
leads and a long sales cycle. Because this is hardly an effective formula to
get a newer agent up and running in a hurry, I don’t recommend it.
Developing sales ability to win customers
The single most important skill for a real estate agent is sales ability, and
sales ability is how you win customers. Your sales ability is based on how
effective you are in generating prospects, following up on those prospects to
secure appointments, qualifying those appointments, conducting the
appointments to secure an exclusive agency contract, and then providing ser-
vice to that recently created client. People also base your ability on how
quickly you can accomplish all this.
Because you’re holding this book, I’m willing to bet that you’ve either just
come out of training to receive your real estate license or you’re in the early
days of your career. In either case, decide right now to master the skills of
selling in order to fuel your success.
15
Chapter 1: Discovering the Skills of a Successful Agent

It’s hard to believe that probably 95 percent of agents lack top-level sales
skills. In my career in training and coaching, I’ve met tens of thousands of
agents. Very few, even at the top echelon of earnings, have had any formal-
ized sales training. Whenever I speak to agents, I always ask the audience
how many have taken any formalized sales training, and I usually see only a
few hands out of the hundreds in the room.
The other reason I know sales skills are lacking is because I coach some of
the best and highest-earning agents in the world, and even they believe their
sales skills can use improvement. Many agents tape their prospecting ses-
sions or listing presentations, but I have yet to meet one who feels that
they’ve nailed their sales skills. The difference between these high-earning
agents and other agents is that the high-earning agents realize that sales
skills are vital to success and they continuously seek excellence in this area.
To follow the high-earning agent’s example, make it your priority to develop
and constantly improve your sales skills for the following reasons:
 To secure appointments. Chapter 5 provides practically everything you
need to know about winning leads and appointments through prospect-
ing and follow-up activities.
 To persuade expired and for-sale-by-owner listings to move their prop-
erties to your business. Chapter 7 is full of secrets and tips to follow as
you pursue this lucrative and largely untouched field.
 To make persuasive presentations that result in positive buying deci-
sions. Chapter 9 helps you with every step from prequalifying prospects
to planning your presentation. It’s packed with tips for perfecting your
skills, addressing and overcoming objections, and ending with a logical
and successful close.
Gaining customers no matter 
the market conditions
According to the National Association of Realtors, over half of current real
estate agents have been in the business less than three years. That means
more than one out of two of today’s agents (probably including you) have
never experienced a marketplace where homes sat on the market for 60, 90,
or 120 days, where agents faced stiff competition to move listings, and where
it took real work to find and create client leads.
In robust market conditions, leads are abundant and relatively easy to
attract, especially buyer leads. But when the market slows, as it inevitably
will, real estate success becomes less automatic. Only great sales skills guar-
antee that you — instead of some other agent — will win clients no matter
the market conditions. The best agents make more money in a challenging
market than they do in a robust market.

Regardless of economics, every market contains real estate buyers and sell-
ers. No matter how slow the economy, people always need and want to
change homes. Babies are born. Managers get transferred. Couples get mar-
ried. People divorce. And with these transitions, real estate opportunities
arise for those with the best sales skills.
The way to build immunity to shifting market conditions is to arm yourself
with skills in prospecting, lead follow-up, presentations, objection handling,
and closing. The information in Part II of this book guides you to success.
Becoming a Listing Agent
In real estate, there’s a saying that “you list to last.” In your early days, you’re
likely to build your business by working primarily with buyers. But in time,
you begin to develop your own listings, and following that you begin your
climb to real estate’s pinnacle position, which is that of a listing agent.
To create long-term success, a high quality of life, and a strong real estate
business, set as your goal to eventually join the elite group — comprised of
fewer than 10 percent of all agents — who are listing agents. The advantages
are many:
 Multiple streams of income. Listings generate interest and trigger addi-
tional transactions. Almost the minute you announce your listing by
putting a sign in the ground, you’ll start receiving calls from neighbors,
drive-by traffic, and people wanting to live in the area. These calls repre-
sent current and future business opportunities that only arise when you
have a listing with your name on it.
 Promotional opportunity. A listing gives you a reason to advertise and
draw the attention of prospects that you can convert to clients or future
prospects. And when your listing sells, you can spread the word of your
success with another round of communication to those in the neighbor-
hood and throughout your sphere of influence.
 A business multiplier. Talk to any listing agent and you’ll have this fact
confirmed: One listing equals more than one sale.
On average, over the course of my career, every listing I took resulted in
1.68 closed sales as a result of additional business generated by ad calls,
sign calls, and the fact that the listing seller wanted to buy another
home. In other words, I won more business than I offered for sale.
If you gave your financial adviser a single dollar and in a few months you
received the dollar back with an additional 68 cents, you’d do back flips.
In fact, you’d probably be rifling through sofa cushions looking for addi-
tional dimes and dollars to send toward similar investments. And that’s
17
Chapter 1: Discovering the Skills of a Successful Agent

the same motivation that propels the best agents into the field of list-
ings. The multipliers vary by agent, but they always result in a pretty
impressive return on investment.
 A free team of agents working for you. The moment you post your list-
ing, all the other agents in your area will go to work on your behalf. And
the best part is they don’t require payment until they deliver a buyer,
and then they’ll be paid not by you but by your seller through the com-
mission structure.
Much of the information in this book focuses on developing listings, because
to achieve top-level success listings are the name of the game.
Pathways to Success: 
Which Will You Take?
Agents typically follow one of these four basic approaches in the quest to
achieve real estate success:
 Become a workaholic. More than 80 percent of agents who generate a
reasonable income achieve their success by turning their careers into a
seven-day-a-week, 24-hour-a-day job. They answer business phone calls
day and night, they make themselves constantly available to prospects
and clients, and they work on-demand with no restraints.
 Buy clients. The second-most frequent pathway to success is to buy
business through massive marketing campaigns. Some agents buy or
brand their way to top-level real estate by investing in billboards and
bus benches with their names and faces on them, thousands of direct
mailers, expensive ad schedules, and all kinds of promotions. Others
buy their way to the top by discounting their commissions. By offering
themselves at the lowest prices, these agents eliminate the need to
emphasize their skills, abilities, and expertise.
 Take the shady road. Another avenue to real estate financial success is
to abandon ethics and just go for the deal and the resulting money.
Unlike the vast majority of agents who advise and advocate for their
clients, agents who take this route choose not to be bound by ethics or
any codes of conduct. They put their own needs first and put their
clients’ best interests in distant second place. Fortunately, these agents
are few and far between.
18
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

 Build a professional services business. The fourth and best pathway is
to create a well-rounded, professional services business not unlike that
of a doctor, a dentist, an attorney, or an accountant. Fewer than 5 per-
cent of all agents follow this route, yet the ones that do are the ones who
earn the largest sums of money — some exceeding $1 million annually
while also having high-quality lives and time for friends and family. Plus,
when they’re ready to bow out of the industry, they have a business
asset they can sell to another agent. (See the upcoming sidebar, “Mining
gold from your professional services business,” for more details on cre-
ating an asset you can sell.)
This is the route I urge you to follow. Each of the following chapters in
this book tells you exactly how to build your own professional services
business.
19
Chapter 1: Discovering the Skills of a Successful Agent
Mining gold from your professional 
services business
The best professionals provide ongoing ser-
vices to clients who wouldn’t think of taking
their business elsewhere. These professionals
develop reputations and client loyalty that
reside in their company names, even after the
founding professionals move on to other ven-
tures or into retirement. Doing more than just
earning an income and building a clientele,
these professionals build an asset that they can
sell, which allows them to receive compensa-
tion from the value of the successful businesses
they’ve built.
As a favorite example, my father was a dentist
for 30 years. When he decided to retire, he sold
his practice to another dentist. He sold his build-
ing and equipment, but most importantly, he sold
his patient roster, which raked in the majority of
the money he received.
A real estate agent who builds a well-rounded,
successful business can enjoy a similarly lucra-
tive sale. In fact, your objective should be to
build the kind of business that you can sell at the
completion of your real estate career.
I worked with a coaching client a few years ago
as she prepared her business for sale. She
tracked lead-making strategies, lead conver-
sion rates, client satisfaction, listings, buyers,
and net profit. Then for two years, we worked
together to improve all the facets of her busi-
ness until they were fine-tuned to perfection.
She was among the minority 5 percent of all
agents who built a truly well-rounded business.
The result: Her real estate practice sold for well
over $1 million. How’s that for a goal?

Residential versus Commercial:
Deciding Which Type of Real
Estate Is Right for You
In This Chapter
 Differentiating between commercial and residential real estate specialties
 Understanding the risks and rewards in each field
 Choosing the right specialty for you
T
he worlds of residential and commercial real estate agents are as different
as night and day. Each arena offers its own set of opportunities, advan-
tages, and challenges. Surprisingly, you find little overlap in terms of the
types of clients served, the emotional involvement of buyers, the sales
process, and the real estate agent’s financial return against time invested.
Count on the info in this chapter to help you sort through the differences and
decide on the real estate field that best matches your personal goals for
career advancement, income, wealth, challenge, and overall opportunity.
Sizing Up the Differences between
Residential and Commercial Agents
When I decided to become a real estate agent in 1990, I didn’t even consider
residential real estate sales as a career path. I wanted to wear the nice suits,
drive the fancy cars, and meet over power lunches with those who made the
business world turn. I wanted to sell and lease commercial real estate.

Fortunately, I called a long-time friend, Kerry Gilbert, who at the time was one
of the most successful commercial agents in my market area of Portland,
Oregon. He listened to my aspirations and responded with candid advice
about the direction I’d chosen. He gave it to me straight then, and I give it to
you straight now.
Of all the wisdom he shared with me that day, one thing he said really stuck
in my mind: “Making $100,000 a year is easiest in the arena of residential real
estate. In fact, you can reach that goal in your first year.” He’d been there and
done it all — residential real estate, commercial real estate, and land develop-
ment. Independently or through syndications or joint ventures, he’d had a
personal stake in every facet of commercial real estate including sales of
retail buildings, apartments, undeveloped land, and office and industrial
spaces. He knew the game from firsthand experience and I knew he was
speaking the truth. I followed his words and broke into the residential arena.
The following information helps you weigh your options and make a decision
for yourself.
Comparing commercial and residential
real estate: It’s apples to oranges
Comparing commercial real estate to residential real estate is like comparing
apples to oranges. Both are from the same genre, but that is where the simi-
larities end. The following are general descriptions of the two types of real
estate:
 Commercial real estate is business-focused. It involves property that is
sold, leased, or used to achieve a predetermined business objective. It’s
used as an investment to achieve an anticipated rate of return on the
funds invested.
 Residential real estate revolves around the wants and needs of a
homeowner and his family. It involves property purchased for individ-
ual use, most often to provide housing for families.
The selling process for commercial real estate hinges on numbers and return-
on-investment calculations. Residential real estate is nowhere near so cut-
and-dried because it’s more of an emotional purchase. Many buyers make
decisions based on the fact that the house just feels right to them. I’ve sold
homes to people who insisted they needed a fourth bedroom, an island
kitchen, a family room off the kitchen, or a three-car garage. Yet when they
fell in love with a home that lacked their must-have amenities, they pur-
chased anyway and were thrilled with the decision. In commercial real estate,
however, feelings and emotions account for little in the purchase. The key
factor is the return on investment.
22
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

What is residential real estate?
Residential real estate is focused on personal use. For the most part, residen-
tial agent’s represent the buyers or sellers of single family, primary homes.
Within the residential real estate arena, agents also engage in the following
specialties:
 Selling secondary homes to people seeking a “home-away-from-home”
to get away from it all. The second home market is one of the fastest-
growing segments of the residential real estate arena. More than 21 per-
cent of the sales in 2004 were second home purchases for use by the
purchaser or for investment purposes.
 Working exclusively for a builder of new homes, usually by serving as
the on-site salesperson for a new home community. In this role, the
agent sells only the builder’s homes. If buyers need to sell an existing
home outside of that community, usually another agent handles that sale.
 Representing residential real estate investors who are looking to
increase wealth through the ownership of homes, duplexes, triplexes,
and fourplexes. Small-scale multiplexes are handled by residential
rather than commercial agents for the following two reasons:
• Often the purchaser lives in one segment of the multiplex, creating
a residence as well as an investment property.
• Usually a purchaser can buy up to a fourplex with a conventional
mortgage.
Residential agents rarely represent buyers or sellers of multiplexes with
more than four dwelling units. Purchasers of larger complexes must
qualify for and secure commercial real estate loans — which involve a
more restrictive set of conditions, including higher interest rates,
shorter amortization schedules, and considerably higher initial equity
positions or down payments.
What is commercial real estate?
Commercial real estate centers on business or investment use of real estate.
In commercial real estate, you can buy, sell, lease as a lessor (the person who
owns the property for lease), lease as a lessee (the person who’s trying to
lease the property for their use), syndicate, joint venture, develop, option,
and invest in a wide range of commercial real estate categories, including
retail, office, industrial, apartments, investments, and raw-land leasing.
Commercial real estate agents are usually familiar with many of the commer-
cial real estate areas, but they generally specialize in one of the following
areas or disciplines:
23
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

 Representing tenants or lessees by finding, selecting, and negotiating
new space for client businesses.
 Representing building owners or lessors by working to lease out build-
ing space for the highest possible price and with the most favorable
terms. Frequently a commercial agent represents one owner or even one
building exclusively in order to ensure the building is leased to capacity.
 Representing investors who want to buy and sell commercial property
by finding opportunities that offer the lowest risk to the client, the best
return on investment, and the best capitalization rate, which is the net
operating income of the property divided by the sales price or value of
the property.
Weighing advantages and disadvantages
Before you launch your career in residential or commercial real estate, you
need to objectively weigh the pros and cons against your own goals and
interests. Making a U-turn after the wrong initial selection could take at least
one year. The upcoming sections help you view the two paths with an objec-
tive eye, without getting wrapped up in the excitement of either.
Exploring the pros and cons of a commercial real estate specialty
Landing a job at a commercial brokerage house is much like being hired into
a Fortune 500 company. Expect to attend a series of interviews, answer a
number of questions about your history and educational background, and
endure a careful assessment of your ability to succeed in the field. Once you
land a job, most commercial real estate companies pay you a salary while
you cut your teeth in your new career. They want you to succeed, and they
stake a monetary investment in your success.
The pros
Commercial agents work in a far more respected business environment than
that of residential agents. They’re part of the circle of movers and shakers in
their towns or cities. They present a polished and positive image and dress
for success in power suits. And, compared to residential agents, they’re held
in higher regard by their prospects and clients. Following are some of the
many positive aspects of a commercial real estate specialty:
 You join an elite group. Expect to find fewer real estate companies and
fewer job openings in the commercial field than in the residential arena.
The good news is that when you land a job, you encounter fewer people
to compete against.
24
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

 You benefit from a professional, well-managed environment. I believe
that most commercial real estate companies are managed more effec-
tively than residential real estate companies. Because of this effective
management, you benefit from the following distinct advantages:
• Smaller staff size. While a residential office may have 150 to 200
full- and part-time agents, most commercial offices range in size
from a few people to 50 agents, all of whom work full time as seri-
ous professionals in the field. Fewer agents translates to fewer neg-
ative interpersonal issues and more time that managers can invest
in training and coaching new agents.
• Training and performance monitoring. Commercial brokers treat
new agents like long-time employees by requiring performance of
certain tasks or activities within a specific time frame, holding
agents accountable, and monitoring sales outcomes. As a result,
new agents continually improve their skills and expertise.
• Support staff. Most commercial brokerages have a larger support
staff than residential companies, which fortunately provides more
administrative assistance to agents.
• Research services. Most large commercial brokerages include
research departments that monitor every influence on the local
and national market, including jobs, economic conditions, business
expansion, and investment trends. The research departments also
produce reports on inventory of properties, sales, tenants, absorp-
tion rates, and marketplace activity, which provides you with
advanced tools to position yourself as the expert.
 You work with in-house listings. Commercial brokerages sign contracts
with local, national, or international companies to represent their real
estate interests. The brokerages may serve as the exclusive tenant rep-
resentative for a company, as the exclusive listing agent for an investor
who owns multiple buildings, as the exclusive leasing agent for a major
building, or as the representative of a major firm’s real estate interests
nationwide or even worldwide.
As a newer agent, you may be assigned to serve as your company’s
junior representative. As a junior representative, you work alongside one
of the best salespeople in your firm. Your job is to help the salesperson
represent a client — and likely it will be a client that you never would
have been able to land on your own. This experience provides you with
a tremendous opportunity to explore the field while earning a stable
income.
 You earn larger commission checks. On average, commercial brokers
earn larger commission checks per transaction than their residential
counterparts. Sometimes, a commercial broker earns a six-figure income
from a single transaction. This is due to the size of the transaction sales
amounts, which can top $5 million.
25
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

 You can earn a large income without selling a thing. Commercial real
estate affords an agent many ways to receive compensation without ever
selling property. The most common specialty is to become a leasing
agent, where you represent a lessor over an extended period of time. In
most commercial leases, the tenant terms and conditions cover a series
of years with monthly payments escalating at predetermined points
along the way. When the lessee and lessor extend or renew the lease, the
original agreement stipulates that the commercial agent earns a commis-
sion for the next contract period, with no new “sale” necessary.
In commercial real estate sales transactions, the listing agent receives
only the revenue from the purchase commission. The selling agent, how-
ever, receives not only the sale commission revenue but also the inside
track to represent the new owner in tenant negotiations, which can
deliver lease commissions for years to come.
 You work normal business hours. Commercial clients are leaders who
generally conduct business on a 9-to-5, Monday-through-Friday sched-
ule. Commercial real estate agents rarely find themselves working on
evenings or weekends.
26
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 
Balancing the best and worst of real estate sales
If you’re like most people who go into real estate
sales, you want to be an independent contrac-
tor with the freedom to choose your path, des-
tiny, and income. That’s one of the best things
about real estate sales: No one can tell you
what to do, how to do it, or when to do it.
The flip side of that same truth is one of the
worst things about real estate sales: No one 
can tell you what to do, how to do it, or when to
do it — except in commercial real estate where
most new agents work against clearly defined
performance standards with consistent moni-
toring that leads almost directly to dramatic
increases in the probability of success.
Performance management experts cite two
well-known adages: “When performance is
measured, performance improves,” and “When
performance is measured and reported, perfor-
mance improves faster.” The training you’ll
receive as a new commercial agent works to
your benefit on both fronts. Your performance
will be measured, your progress will be
reported, and you will learn and change your
approaches in response.
In my company, Real Estate Champions, we
require members of our sales staff to make a
certain number of sales calls on the phone each
day. We also require a predetermined number
of presentations daily and weekly. And each
person is required to make a specific number 
of sales. Weekly, all sales staff members hand
in to the sales manager a tape of their calls,
contacts, and presentations to show that they
have complied with the minimum standards of
activities, monitoring, and results. No ifs, ands,
or buts.
Tackling the worst thing about real estate sales
— forcing yourself to do what you should do
even when you don’t feel like doing it — will
deliver the best thing about real estate sales:
personal and economic freedom. If you go into
commercial real estate, your manager will help
you define what to do, how to do it, and when to
do it. If you go into residential sales, be ready to
set and monitor your own high objectives.

The cons
Based on the preceding section, you must think that commercial real estate
sounds pretty terrific: You get treated better, earn larger fees, get a base
salary from day one, and receive repeated payments well into the future for
relationships you created years ago.
But you find downsides to the commercial real estate business, too.
Following are a few realities to consider:
 Commercial real estate is a risky environment. As a commercial real
estate agent, your exposure to marketplace and economic swings, on
top of the pressure you feel to get space leased or sold, knows no com-
parison in the residential world. A building owner with a 50 percent
vacancy rate may lose tens of thousands of dollars each month.
Generally speaking, when such a situation continues for a few months,
you can expect the owner to demand performance, now!
 The marketplace can change rapidly. A national or regional economic
slowdown, or even a softening at the local level, can trigger dramatic
market swings that negatively affect commercial agents and their clients.
An economic sector may slow down and flood your market with com-
mercial space. A large company may close or move, driving excess office
space onto the market. Or, new space may even come onto the market at
the same time the economy is slowing, resulting in a tough environment
of overbuilt sectors and tons of losses and falling values.
 Maintaining control of the deal can be a struggle. Commercial clients,
as a whole, aren’t very controllable. The people who own buildings, fac-
tories, industrial sites, flex space, and retail strip malls are high powered
and are most comfortable when in control. In most cases, they’re
shrewd investors who are attracted to a deal based on its value and
income potential, with little, if any, emotion involved. They don’t really
care who brings them the deal and whether it is served on a silver plat-
ter. They just want the deal. This “just the facts ma’am” approach 
doesn’t breed loyalty on anyone’s part.
Commercial clients also know that large commission checks result from
their transactions with the agents. Never mind that the agents may work
months or even years to earn that commission or that they may not
have received a commission check over the last six months. To many
investors the commission simply represents a large line item in the cost
of the sale, and in the offer and acceptance process they aren’t shy
about asking the agent to reduce the commission percentage.
 Budget skills are essential. Commercial real estate commission checks
arrive only sporadically. To offset the gap, you need strong money man-
agement ability, including the discipline to store up commission income
since it may be several months before the next check comes through.
27
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

 Don’t count on much independence. Compared to residential agents,
commercial agents have a lot less independence in deciding which
market they’ll work in. Your commercial brokerage company generally
assigns you to a market sector. Whether you end up in retail, invest-
ments, apartments, industrial, or office leasing depends on your com-
pany’s needs. Wherever they have an opening is where you’re going to
be sent.
 Commission splits are weighted toward commercial brokerage compa-
nies. The standard fee split arrangement generally divides commercial
commission revenue on a 50/50 basis between the brokerage and the
agent. However, when you’re working on a company account as a new
agent, your portion is usually less than half. This split makes sense
because you’re still training and because you didn’t secure the relation-
ship or the deal, but rather had it handed to you (along with a base salary
and company-provided administrative support and research assistance).
However, once you’re a trained agent, the 50/50 arrangement doesn’t
change as drastically as it can in the residential arena.
 You construct your own database. Commercial real estate is a database
business. For example, in office leasing you have to create a database of
all the buildings in the marketplace and all the information about the
buildings: Tenant lists, when leases are up, building features and ameni-
ties, ownership information (whether owned by an individual, a com-
pany, an insurance trust, or a real estate investment trust), and owner
contact information. Unearthing this information takes considerable
time — imagine what’s involved just to find the decision-maker of a
building owned by a distant company or trust.
Brokerages don’t provide this collection of information, and most com-
mercial agents don’t share information even within their own company.
You’re left to construct your database on your own, which takes large
bites of time out of your calendar.
 Acquiring what you’re selling can be difficult. Even if you could afford
it (see the next bulleted item in this list for more on the sky-high eco-
nomic threshold), large brokerage companies don’t want you to buy the
commercial real estate you’re selling. They believe that doing so could
create a conflict of interest with their best clients, to whom they have a
fiduciary responsibility to present the best opportunities.
 Commercial clients are few and far between. In most large market
areas, the commercial real estate arena usually only involves large insti-
tutional investors or extremely wealthy individuals. I believe that a
person must be at least a deca-millionaire to enter today’s commercial
ownership game on a large scale.
Sure, small business owners can buy the buildings they occupy, but for
them to go beyond that in today’s marketplace is largely outside the
realm of possibility. The marketplace was vastly different 10, 15, or even
25 years ago. Back then, commercial real estate was an open playing
field. But today it’s hardly a place for what I call little guy investors.
28
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

Pros and cons of a residential real estate specialty
Let me own up to a personal bias: I firmly believe that while commercial real
estate is a wonderful business opportunity, you find more and better benefits
in residential real estate. Even though getting there wasn’t entirely my own
choice, I spent my whole career in this arena.
Originally I set out to become a commercial agent, interviewing with
Portland’s big firms, including CB Richard Ellis, Coldwell Banker Commercial,
Grubb & Ellis, and Cushman & Wakefield. I thought I was close at Cushman &
Wakefield but didn’t get a job offer. I called the manager back several times a
week for weeks on end until he gave me a final brushoff — a fact that I now
look back on and laugh at . . . all the way to the bank. I ended up making more
money in residential real estate than 99 percent of those in commercial real
estate.
The pros
The favorable aspects of residential real estate stack into four main cate-
gories. Following is a look at these categories and how each gives an edge to
the residential real estate agent:
 Low risks and high gains. While other business owners have to buy
equipment, sign leases for space, amass costly inventory, and develop,
build, and market products, a residential agent needs only a computer,
contact management and MLS software, a high-speed internet connec-
tion, a phone line, a reliable car, and a stack of business cards.
Compared to the thousands (or hundreds of thousands) of dollars that
other businesses risk before they even open their doors, a residential
agent risks little, yet has the opportunity to make hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars a year.
Today’s agents add Web sites, marketing pieces, and many other sup-
port documents to help fuel their success, but I can tell you from experi-
ence that with little more than the initial list, I made over $100,000 in my
first full year in the business.
I can also tell you that within the real estate arena, the relatively low
volatility of the market is another huge benefit for residential agents.
Volatility is the large swinging in property values and in buying and sell-
ing activity. Unlike in commercial real estate, market swings are driven
more by inventory levels than by economic factors. Houses are sold pri-
marily to the people who will be living in them. Regardless of the econ-
omy, they need somewhere to live. Even if homes decline in value,
homeowners aren’t likely to walk away from their homes and lose their
investment value. This low volatility of the residential real estate market
helps soften the effects of market swings and also reduces risk.
29
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

 Tremendous opportunity. As a residential agent, you can profit in a
number of ways. First, of course, you can list and sell houses. No matter
what market conditions are present in your marketplace, some people
always want to buy and sell. For example, your marketplace could be
declining in value, but people would still be buying and selling in the
area. Beyond that, you can reap benefits from the following avenues:
• Residential agents have easy access to lucrative investment
opportunities. Many of these opportunities are available with lim-
ited or even no money down. I know many agents who secured
good properties by using the resulting commission check as the
down payment. With a little time and effort, you can easily find and
finance residential deals from single-family homes to fourplexes.
If I had a dime for every time someone has said to me, “If you can
find me a really good deal, I’ll buy it,” I could buy a few good deals
with the proceeds. What they’re really saying is that if you find a

Wanna make $100,000 in residential real estate?
Anyone can make a bundle in residential real
estate. I truly believe that and say it every time
I speak to a group of new agents. I add this
caveat here: If you work hard, apply the tech-
niques in this book, and follow these four rules
of real estate success, you will make $100,000 
a year.
1. Show up. To achieve success, show up, and
show up early. Show up consistently to do
the activities that create revenue. Put in
enough hours to achieve success. The vast
majority of people never show up. You can’t
expect to make $100,000 a year in a new
career by working 10 hours a week.
2. Focus mentally. When it’s time to do
prospecting or lead follow-up, focus intently
on the outcome you desire and then take
action. Do it — and then prepare to do it
even better. Don’t make the mistake of all
those who fall short of their goals and who
stop reading and learning when they com-
plete their formal educations. Continuously
improve your skills, your personal philoso-
phy, your ability to focus, and your intent to
succeed.
3. Tell the truth. Tell the truth to a seller who
wants to overprice a property. Tell the truth
to a buyer who wants a purchase price that
doesn’t exist. When you need to “get real,”
it’s better to have the honest and frank dis-
cussion as early as possible.
4. Don’t be attached to the outcome. Don’t let
yourself get derailed for hours, days, or
even weeks because of some negative
event. Maybe buyers you thought were
loyal to you buy with someone else. Or, per-
haps a pending transaction you were
counting on goes up in flames and CPR
won’t even bring it back. Then, out of
nowhere, you lose a listing when you
thought the seller was working with you.
Welcome to the game of real estate. Play it
long enough and expose yourself to enough
transactions, and these events, plus plenty
of others, are sure to happen. When they
do, just scream at the top of your lungs a
good four-letter word: NEXT!

property for $50,000 below market they’ll buy it — as if they’re
doing you a favor by giving you a chance to earn a commission
check.
The fact is that if you find a property priced $50,000 below market,
as an agent you can buy it yourself. Residential real estate affords
you the opportunity and the access to make those kinds of deals
possible.
• You can leverage your efforts. As a residential agent you really
aren’t a one-person team. You’re an economic engine. Fortunately, I
adopted this philosophy early in my career. By becoming a listing
agent, I, in effect, could hire the 6,000 other licensed residential
agents in Portland, Oregon, to work for me on a contingency basis
at no risk to my business. For example, they would show my list-
ings to prospective buyers and I didn’t have to split my fee or pay
them until the sale closed and I calculated the commission.
During a typical transaction, you spend far less time with a seller
than with a buyer. That’s why many of the most successful agents
leverage their efforts by working with buyers’ agents rather than
working directly with buyers.
Another easy way to leverage your efforts is to hire an assistant to
handle administrative tasks so you can invest a greater portion of
your time in prospecting, lead follow-up, and other sales functions.
• As you earn more, your commission splits increase, as well. In
your early years as an agent, expect an agent/company commis-
sion split arrangement somewhere in the neighborhood of 50/50,
based on your experience and production and the services that
your company provides.
Once you become a seasoned agent, a good thing just keeps get-
ting better. As your production increases, so does your portion of
the commission. When you’re able to produce income on your own
without company floor time, company leads, and company open
houses, your company may offer 90 percent or 100 percent com-
mission options. In return, the best producers pay a monthly flat
fee to the real estate company.
• Successful residential agents actually build and run a business.
As a successful residential agent you handle sales and marketing,
leadership of people, vision casting, financial management, and all
other aspects of small business management.
• You can build and sell your practice. When doctors, dentists,
accountants, attorneys, or other professionals retire, they sell their
practices (basically their clients) to other professionals. Then they
work jointly over a six-month or yearlong transition period turning
over the reins and bowing out of the business. Residential agents
can follow the same track.

Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

Over the last few years, a number of my clients have sold their
practices for substantial amounts of money. They had built strong
businesses and quantified their production, gross commission
income, and net profit over a period of years. They could show
prospective purchasers exactly where and how they generated
prospects and sales, and they could prove what their businesses
were worth in terms of revenue and profit.
 A readily accessible clientele. Unlike commercial agents, who have to
construct databases, do research, and invest considerable effort to find
people who may want their services, residential real estate offers a large
and ready pool of prospects. In fact, almost anyone could be a prospect
for home ownership. However, the key word in that sentence is could.
See Chapter 5 for a look at who is and who isn’t a likely prospect, and
how to reach those who are.
Here are some tips for gaining prospects:
• As a start, you can work with people you already know, which
makes finding new clients in the early stages of your career more
comfortable.
• You can attract prospects via ads, Internet sites, and open houses.
(See Chapter 8 for open house information and Chapter 12 for mar-
keting advice.)
• You can work to win the listings of homes currently (and unsuc-
cessfully) for sale by owners. As a mentor early in my real estate
career said, “All you have to do is open up the Sunday newspaper
and you find a whole lot of prospects. All you need is enough guts
to call them.” He was right. Most homes being sold directly by
owners are advertised in the Sunday paper and are grouped
together with prominently presented phone numbers staring right
at you. No searching required.
• You can convert expired listings to new listings for your business.
To find expired listings, pull up information on the MLS service
daily.
• You can also conduct title only searches to find contact informa-
tion for absentee owners, owners in specific neighborhoods, or
people who have owned in an area for three, five, or seven years,
who may be ready to reenter the real estate marketplace as buyers
or sellers.
The residential real estate agent’s ability to have a constant stream of new
prospects to work with is like no other sales industry or sales profession.
 It’s wonderfully lonely at the top. When it comes to competition in resi-
dential real estate, success-minded individuals find the field close to
wide open. If you want to conduct a competitive analysis, the best place
to start is by looking in your own mirror. I’ve always felt that I was my
only competition. No one was preventing me from achieving my listing,
sales, or income goals except for me.

Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

The vast majority of agents survive only in positive market conditions.
When market activity swings to neutral, the exodus begins and only the
serious professionals remain.
The road to the pinnacle of residential real estate success is open and
definitely worth driving. As a residential real estate agent you can earn
more than the highest paid surgeon. I have a handful of coaching clients
who now earn more than $1 million a year. You read that correctly: one
million dollars. You won’t find many other professions where someone
who didn’t finish college has the unlimited opportunity to make $1 mil-
lion a year. All you have to do is commit to continuously improving your
skills, abilities, knowledge, organization, and systems over where they
were last year, last quarter, last month, and even last week.
The cons
By now you may think that I’m so obviously sold on the benefits of a residen-
tial real estate career that I can’t render an objective opinion about the field’s
negative aspects. This section proves otherwise. I’ve packed it with truths
you need to know about the residential real estate work environment, profes-
sionalism, and work hours. Here are some cons to consider:
 A distracting work environment. You may hear the work environment
of many real estate offices described as chaotic, emotional, and in some
cases toxic. Nice, huh?
As a result, more and more agents work from their homes. They use
company offices to meet clients but conduct day-to-day activities in self-
contained home office biospheres that leave the distractions of a typical
real estate office behind.
As a newer agent, you may be required to work out of the company
office initially. However, you benefit from access to your broker or man-
ager, and you have the opportunity to train with the other agents.
When in the company office, watch for these three major problem areas:
• Beware of the bullpen. The bullpen is the large work area in the
center of a real estate office that’s filled with little cubicles where
new or low-producing agents work. Each workspace is reminiscent
of the desklike carrels in an elementary school library. Since most
agents aren’t the size of third graders anymore, working with their
knees at their chins has proven to be quite the challenge.
Within the bullpen, walls reach only high enough to block views
when a person is seated. They provide only minimal privacy and
dull practically no noise, which makes focusing on tasks extremely
difficult. It’s particularly challenging to place outbound sales calls,
your most important task each day, when you have other conver-
sations happening around you.
33
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

• Beware of the coffee and doughnut bunch. You won’t have to
look hard to find this group in any real estate office. They’re more
interested in the social restructuring of the real estate office than
in sales, and they’re always seeking new members. Their mission is
to solve the world’s problems and, if they have time, sell a few
homes. Talk to any one of them (if you dare!) and you hear that the
next big deal is right around the corner if: the market would
improve; this fickle buyer would just buy; my deal (as in my one
and only deal) would close; the company would do more for its
agents; and on and on. They carry around a laundry list of prob-
lems and issues that block their success, and they’re always happy
to share them with you, at length.
It’s easy to get sucked into their black hole because they want you
in their group and you, as a new agent, want to build relationships.
On the surface, they also seem to know what they’re talking about
because they often cite their years of experience. The problem is
that an eight-year agent in this group likely has one year of true
experience, repeated eight times.
• Beware of the open-door policy. Some companies still allow
anyone to wander in: mortgage originators, escrow officers, title
representatives, termite inspectors, home inspectors, ad salespeo-
ple, Web site developers, and closing gift catalog purveyors.
Opening the doors to everyone results in a constant stream of
people trying to sell you something. They’re all working to win
your business while it’s still early in your career, and they won’t
stop trying to maintain it for years to come. (This principle of early
loyalty comes straight out of the credit card industry playbook:
Why else would college-age individuals receive more credit card
offers than the rest of the population combined?)
Even if your office has a closed-door policy, you’re still susceptible
to intrusion by salespeople. They make an appointment with one
agent and then roam the office distributing brochures and
notepads and pens and issuing invitations for lunch, dinner, or
coffee. You could eat lunch for free forever if you played your cards
right. However, for your own success, protect your time and spend
it selling rather than being sold.
 Low professional standards and practices. Lack of professionalism in
residential real estate stems from the following three root causes:
• Low barrier to entry. In most states, once you complete around 90
hours of training you’re ready to sit for the real estate exam. Log
onto an Internet course and you don’t even have to show up at an
actual school or for a set of classes.
34
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

In many states, you pay less than $1,000 for training. Simply put in
the hours, memorize the material, take the test, write the checks to
cover the state licensing fees, board dues, and the MLS fees, and
you’re ready to roll. Many real estate companies even rebate some
of your upfront costs when they issue your first commission checks.
• Constant turnover of agents. Hand-in-hand with the low barrier to
entry is the revolving door that allows agents to constantly come
and go as they please. They enter the field, try to make it, and then
wash out. Fewer than 20 percent of all new agents — not even one
out of every five — actually stay and experience success in the field.
Many people (including myself) gravitate toward careers in residen-
tial real estate when they can’t get a job anywhere else. My story is
that I couldn’t get hired after months of trying to get a “good” sales
job. I didn’t have a college degree, and no larger company was
going to take the risk on me, so I went into real estate sales.
• Part-time operators. It’s difficult to rise above the rank of amateur
when you’re only partially devoted to an activity. The residential
real estate arena teems with part-time agents — many of whom
have obvious deficiencies when it comes to skills, abilities, knowl-
edge, commitment, service, expertise, and access.
The biggest problem is that consumers and even other agents often
don’t know that the people they’re working with are part-timers.
Obviously agents don’t advertise the fact. I wouldn’t exactly con-
sider it a badge of honor to admit, “I’m just part-time agent trying to
earn enough money to take my family to Hawaii next fall.”
35
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You
The case for full-time professionals
In my view, as residential real estate profes-
sionals, we owe more to our clients and our
industry than part-time participation. Starting
part time to get your feet wet is alright.
However, after six months or a year, at the most,
if you can’t cut the apron strings from your other
job, do yourself, the real estate industry, and
your prospects and clients a service and end
your attempt to become a real estate agent.
Buying or selling a home ranks in the top five
most stressful events in a person’s life. On the
emotional ladder, it sits right up there with
divorce. As a real estate agent, you’re respon-
sible for one of the biggest decisions your
clients make.
An emotional nature exists in the residential real
estate business due to the stress levels of the
buyer, seller, and the other agent. Sadly, agents
often fuel negative emotions if they don’t have
control of their clients, if they don’t have time to
do the job right, or if they’re motivated more by
the need for a commission check to cover a
past-due car payment than by the successful
outcome of the real estate transaction.

For example, if a part-time agent is working as the selling agent for
your listing, you may not discover that fact until you can’t make
contact with the agent, you find horrible errors in the paperwork,
or you have your broker breathing down your neck to get the deal
cleaned up.
 Lack of training. I believe that lack of training is the cause of our indus-
try’s low success numbers, low customer return rates, and low per agent
income. Most companies offer only a couple of weeks of introductory
training for new hires. For the most part, after that the company says,
“Here’s your desk and here’s your phone . . . go get ’em!”
Agents look to their companies for success and motivational tools, while
companies (somewhat rightfully) say, “Hey, you’re an independent con-
tractor, so it’s your obligation to build your strengths and pay for your
training.”
I think that the ball is in the agent’s court. It’s your business — you’re
the one who needs to invest and make it grow. The best money you can
spend is on training to improve your realty skills, knowledge, attitude,
philosophy, and business skills.
 24/7 work hours. As a residential agent, you can count on working some
nights and weekends. Some agents follow a round-the-calendar schedule
for the duration of their careers. A select few bring their night and week-
end hours down to almost zero as their success takes hold.
36
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 
Increased volume can equal 
decreased work hours
By my third year in the business, I was down to
a four-day workweek. I was able to sell more
than 150 homes annually while working Monday
through Thursday and taking Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday completely off, with no interrup-
tions from the cell phone, pager, fax, or e-mail.
On Thursday, around late afternoon to early
evening, my wife, Joan, and I would get into our
car and drive to our vacation home in Bend,
Oregon, some three hours away, for three days
of downtime in recreational paradise. On
Sunday afternoon, we would head back to
Portland refreshed, relaxed, and ready to go.
Over the weekend, my buyers’ agents would
handle buyer calls and inquiries. The other
agents that wrote offers on my properties would
have to wait until Monday for them to be pre-
sented to my sellers. I know that frustrated a
few agents, but since I had well-priced homes,
they would wait. As a listing agent, I had the
control and quality of life that most agents could
only dream about.
I only worked one evening a week (Tuesdays),
which is when I met with clients or caught up
on prospecting with people I couldn’t reach
during the day.
The truth is, over time you can build a high-
volume practice that doesn’t require nighttime
and weekend hours. I’m living proof that it can
be done and so are all of my clients.

 The public’s perception of unlimited access. Real estate clients think
that their agents should be available at the drop of a hat largely because
agents have trained them to expect service 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.
The National Association of Realtors ran a huge marketing campaign a
few years ago. They circulated brochures, ran newspaper and magazine
ads, and aired national TV commercials touting the theme “Real Estate Is
Our Life.” I was furious when I first saw it. I thought they set us real
estate agents back another 10 years with a campaign perpetuating the
myth that real estate agents should be constantly on-call for our clients.
Real estate is an excellent vehicle to fund the lifestyle you desire, but it’s
not your life! Well, it certainly isn’t my life.
The most frequently traveled path to real estate success is to become a
workaholic and to spend large chunks of time paying the price to be
wealthy. No doubt about it, you have to work harder than the other
agents to reach the brass ring, but you don’t have to make yourself avail-
able to clients every hour of every day. If you regularly work 50 hours a
week — five 10-hour days — and if you focus on the right activities
during those hours, I guarantee you can make a significant income in
residential real estate.
 Lack of respect. Real estate agents rival Rodney Dangerfield when it
comes to generating respect from consumers because of our lack of
business skills and ease at which people can become real estate agents.
The lack of respect can be seen as self-inflicted because both as individ-
uals and as an industry, agents do little to illuminate the true benefits
they provide to buyers and sellers. Instead, promotional messages focus
on availability and accessibility, which feeds the notion that real estate
agents are on-call order-takers rather than professional advisors and
experts.
Especially during prosperous market cycles, consumers view the resi-
dential real estate agent’s job as easy and the resulting fees as excessive.
The mindset that real estate agents are raking in “easy money” is fueled
by well-publicized national statistics. When the ranks of the National
Association of Realtors swell from 650,000 members to over 1.2 million
members over a 48-month period, as it did recently, it’s obvious that a
whole lot of agents must also believe a pot of gold is within reach and is
worth chasing.
Many of those 550,000 new agents join consumers in believing that real
estate agents are paid to simply sell houses. No wonder they view resi-
dential agents as overpaid.
What’s more, almost every consumer has a friend or relative who has
recently broken into real estate. If their personal acquaintances are held
in low esteem, you can bet their impressions transfer to other agents,
including you — unless you prove them wrong. It may not be fair, but it
is what it is.
37
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

To earn the respect you deserve, communicate that the value you
deliver reaches far beyond the creation of a sale. Help prospects realize
that as a professional real estate agent the value you deliver includes
protection and security of your client’s interests, expert guidance about
the marketplace, and many other facets that have nothing to do with
producing a buyer and everything to do with producing a favorable out-
come for your client.
Selecting Your Specialty
After wading through the pros and cons of each real estate specialty, take the
time to decide which path you should take. Before setting anything in stone,
consider how your own risk tolerance aligns with the demands of each arena.
Then take the upcoming 7-question litmus test to evaluate how well each
field aligns with your personality and personal interests.
Evaluating your risk tolerance
No question about it, agents in commercial real estate experience a much
stronger risk-and-reward connection than those in the field of residential real
estate.
Residential agents minimize their risk by earning many smaller commission
checks as the result of numerous deals each year. With only a few deals and
larger, but infrequent, checks, commercial real estate agents face a greater
threat when a deal goes awry.
When I sold residential real estate, my average commission check was $3,900.
If a buyer or seller was a problem, it was easy to push the F10 button, which
in the old days of computers was the delete key, and move on to another
opportunity. If I lost a transaction that was set to close, financially I knew it
wasn’t a killer.
You have to take your own feelings toward risk into account as you select
your field. If simply thinking of risks makes your heart stop, take the hint and
steer clear of the high stakes that come part-and-parcel with a commercial
specialty.
38
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

Taking the 7-question litmus test
Most successful business leaders adhere to the tenet that if you ask the right
questions you arrive at the right answers. The following seven questions are
designed to elicit answers to determine whether your personality, interests,
and career goals are best suited to a career in residential or commercial real
estate.
Although no one is likely to answer every question for commercial or for resi-
dential, you can tell which way you’re leaning by tallying up your score and
weighing which questions are most important to you.
 Question 1: What’s your risk quotient?
Do you like to take risks or are you more conservative? Would losing a
large commission check fry your brain or would you view it as part of
the game? The higher your risk tolerance, the better fit you are for a
commercial specialty.
 Question 2: Are you willing to work nights and weekends in the initial
stages of your career?
If you can’t answer yes to this question then you have no choice but to
steer your career toward commercial real estate sales. In residential real
estate, you won’t become successful without working some nights and
weekends during your first couple of years.
 Question 3: What part does your ego play in this decision?
What drives you? Is it important that you’re more recognized as a pro-
fessional? Do you measure success by the respect you receive from
others? Does your ego trump your desire for income? Or vice versa?
As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, my own ego controlled
my decision to become a commercial real estate agent. However, once I
removed my ego and focused on the financial rewards of residential real
estate, I made the right decision for myself.
For many people, the right decision is based largely on ego gratification.
If you’re in that group, opt for a commercial career and commit to being
comfortable with the amount of money that eventually follows.
 Question 4: Do you need a structured work environment to succeed?
If so, how much structure do you need in order to reach your potential?
If you’re among those who need or prefer a strong structure, note that
the environment in commercial real estate is much more structured.
39
Chapter 2: Deciding Which Type of Real Estate Is Right for You

 Question 5: Are you a facts and figures salesperson or do you use feel-
ings and emotions to sway someone’s decision?
This question gets to the heart of the differences between how commer-
cial real estate agents and their residential brethren sell. Commercial
agents deal with buyers and sellers that are predominantly facts-and-fig-
ures oriented. Residential customers base their buying and selling deci-
sions more on emotions and feelings.
 Question 6: Do you need to be part of a team?
If you’re a person who prefers to work as a team member, pause here for
a moment so you can think. Real estate sales, whether it’s residential or
commercial, is an individual sport. The only way it becomes a team
sport is if you form your own team, which is easier to do in residential
than in commercial.
I truly believe that one of the reasons I was successful at residential real
estate was because, as a young adult, I played only a few team sports.
Most of the time, I competed in individual sports where the ultimate win-
ning and losing was done by me.
 Question 7: Do you eventually want to own investment property?
Very few people answer “no” to this question. However, key differences
exist between your ability to purchase what you sell in residential real
estate and what you can purchase in commercial real estate. First and
foremost, it’s much easier to purchase residential real estate than it is to
purchase commercial real estate. It takes less money down and the
financing is more flexible. Also, the investments in residential are easier
to spot and secure than in commercial.

In This Chapter
 Weighing the pros and cons of different types of real estate companies
 Knowing the roles of agency players and the rules of the house
 Choosing and joining your agency team
B
efore you sign on with a real estate company, you need to take time to
look well below the surface and beyond first impressions to determine
whether the company is, in fact, the right one for you.
Most agents, whether new or experienced, don’t invest enough time evaluat-
ing and analyzing companies, owners, and key managers before they commit
to a real estate firm. In this chapter, I help you to do the homework, compare
the opportunities, make the choice, and establish a winning partnership.
Weighing Your Agency Options
An agent choosing an agency isn’t a whole lot different than a consumer
choosing an agent. All the choices look good (often they all look very much
the same!), and they all offer a wide variety of opportunities. What’s more,
they all tell you that they’re the best. So how do you choose?
Choose by weighing benefits. What advantages can you count on in terms of
training, education, floor time, ad calls, sign calls, and market share by join-
ing one company over another company? It’s fair to ask the broker you’re
interviewing with, “What’s in it for me?”
As you assess company choices, use the upcoming advice to evaluate how
office attributes and company size match with your own interests and 
priorities.

Enthusiasm, coffee, and doughnuts: 
What makes a good office?
When I look at a real estate office, I evaluate how they rank based on the fol-
lowing list of attributes:
 Energy and enthusiasm. It takes passion to succeed at essential real
estate activities like prospecting. If you surround yourself with agents
who lack energy and enthusiasm for the business, it will affect your per-
formance.
When trying to determine if an office has energy and enthusiasm, find
out if agents are excited to come to work. Also find out if the office has a
public board where the agents record their listings and sales for all the
other agents to see. If the office does have a board like this, look to see if
it’s full or empty. Are only a few names covering the entire board or are
all the agents represented?
 Reputation. While you can’t count on your company’s reputation to do
your work for you, you can bet that your company’s positive reputation
will help you open doors.
 Experienced manager. As a newer agent, you’ll benefit greatly from a
manager who knows the ropes and who has experience taking agents to
higher levels of production. Ask the following questions: What is the
manager’s track record in raising agent productivity? How long does it
typically take the manager to reach different production thresholds with
agents? The right answers can dramatically affect your career arc.
You’re looking for a manager who has a track record of building success-
ful agents from new agents. Effective managers will have low failure rates
with new agents and will see more than 40 percent of their new agents
become successful. That percentage may seem low, but according to the
National Association of Realtors (NAR), less than 20 percent of the
agents last more than two years. A manager that can give you time
frames and statistics on his agent’s success is a serious candidate for
your manager. Most of them could not tell you the stats.
 Listings inventory. Does the company offer you the opportunity to
establish some income over the early months by working someone
else’s inventory while you’re creating your own? An established inven-
tory gives you the opportunity to create buyers and income by working
open houses, ad calls, and sign calls. For guidance in increasing your
listing inventory, turn to Chapter 5.
42
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

 Training focus. Look into how well the company handles the two major
areas of training: Initial training (so you can earn an income) and on
ongoing training (so you can build and grow your business).
I feel that when they’re selecting an agency, most new agents don’t focus
enough on the company’s training programs because they get wrapped
up in the “what’s my split” game. If, through good training, you’re able to
master the skills you need to excel, your income is unlimited. However, if
you don’t, you have no chance.
Every company says it offers good training. It’s your job to look under
the hood to see for yourself. To do that, ask these two questions:
• What’s the loss ratio for new agents? The loss ratio is the number
of agents who fail after completing the training program. This ratio
tells you the effectiveness of the company’s new agent training 
program.
• How do the agents segment into income brackets? The answer
tells you whether the company’s ongoing training is building the
capabilities of all agents, or of only a few. As an example of a break-
down you want to avoid, check out Table 3-1, which shows how
agents in a 200-agent company segment into earning categories.
Table 3-1
Agent Segmentation by Income Bracket
Income Segment
Number of Agents
$500,000+
1
$250,000+
2
$200,000+
2
$100,000+
5
$50,000+
10
$25,000+
100
$25,000 or less
80
Here’s my advice: If you’re considering a company with a segmen-
tation chart like the one in Table 3-1, run away fast. Opt instead for
a company where a reasonable group of agents earn your desired
income. If 80 percent of agents are making less than $50,000 a year,
the company is a poor fit for a success-oriented agent.
43
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

Considering the rules you’ll be playing by
Real estate agents follow two basic sets of rules:
 The body that governs real estate in your state, which is usually
called The Real Estate Agency, establishes one set of rules. This group
sets laws regarding how to handle the earnest money you collect from a
purchaser, the deadlines for the paperwork that is involved with each
transaction, who is to receive original copies, and what timeline the
legal aspects of the transaction are to follow. The focus of The Real
Estate Agency is centered on consumer protection.
 The second set of rules that most agents follow is the code of ethics
established by the NAR. The code of ethics dictates how agents with
NAR member companies should conduct business and how they should
deal with prospects, clients, and other agents. Obtain a copy of the code
of ethics from your broker, your local real estate board, or online at
www.realtor.com.
However, there are also rules of individual agencies. The following sections
fill you in.
The rules of the house
Most company rules are based on the absolutes presented by state laws and
the NAR code of ethics, but some rules will vary from office to office.
To protect themselves, some companies shorten the legally dictated time
frames to ensure that agents turn paperwork into brokers with time to spare.
Once paperwork is submitted to the principal broker, it gets stamped with a
date that provides evidence of receipt. The Real Estate Agency can audit a
real estate company’s files at any time and, if paperwork doesn’t conform to
regulations, they can levy fines or, worse, close the firm down until lapses are
corrected.
When you’re interviewing with a company, request a copy of their set of
rules, their operational/procedural manual, or their new agent handbook to
find out how they expect you to work. If they can’t produce one, read the lack
of response as a clue about the organizational level of the company.
A penny for you, a penny for me: Commission split arrangements
Media reports advise consumers that seller/agent commission splits are
negotiable. Likewise, buyer/agent commission splits are negotiable as well.
You’re the one that determines your fees. Some agents charge more because
they’re worth more.

New agents all seek a universal formula for commission splits, but none
exists. Each broker establishes a unique formula, usually beginning with a
split that apportions 50 percent of the commission to you and 50 percent to
your broker, moving gradually upward in your favor over time as you achieve
different earning levels.
The following list presents some of the most common commission options
you may see in the industry:
 The graduated split: The graduated split is the most common compen-
sation package. You start at a 50/50 split, which is increased to 60/40 and
upward incrementally as you become more productive and your earn-
ings reach company-established levels for graduation.
 The graduated split capped: Some companies put an annual cap on the
revenue the company derives from the graduated split arrangement.
Once they collect the established amount of company commission
income, the rest is yours.
 The graduated split rollback: Under this increasingly popular compen-
sation arrangement, which is structured primarily for the benefit of the
company, you receive a graduated split, but at the end of each year you
roll back to 50/50 or some other established allocation. With this type of
rollback, the company has a better chance of making decent earnings
from all earnings. Too often, company expenses and profits are covered
by too small of a group of agents. By rolling splits back at the beginning
of each year, companies ensure that their costs are covered by commis-
sion revenue received early in the year. It also motivates agents to
increase productivity over the early months to increase their splits over
the rest of the year.
 100 percent commission: Colloquially, this is known as the rent-a-desk
arrangement. Agents on 100 percent commission pay a flat amount
monthly to rent space and a few services from the company. From there,
they cover all their own costs and retain 100 percent of all the commis-
sions they generate.
You need to be well established and pretty darned successful to do well
under this system, and for that reason I don’t recommend it for new
agents. The risk is too great for beginners, due to their lack of experi-
ence in creating leads and opportunities for income.
Brokerage fees: Don’t bite the hand that feeds you
After compensation arrangements are in place, most brokers add fees to help
cover their expenses. Among the most common fees to expect are transaction
fees, fees to cover errors and omissions insurance costs, and franchise fees.
 Transaction fees: Many brokers charge agents a per transaction fee of
somewhere between $75 and $400 to cover the cost of processing the
paperwork that accompanies a real estate sale.
45
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

 Errors and omissions (E&O) insurance fees: Many brokers charge an
E&O insurance fee on a per deal basis, which often adds $75 to $150 to
each transaction to cover premium costs. E&O insurance protects pro-
fessionals should they make a mistake in service or representation. In
such an event, the insurance company covers legal fees and settlement
costs.
 Franchise fees: If you join a real estate franchise, expect to pay approxi-
mately 6 percent of your gross revenue every time you complete a trans-
action. The percentage is established by the franchise contract. It
doesn’t graduate or fluctuate based on your productivity.
Does size really matter?
Personally, I think size can make up for other deficiencies in real estate com-
panies, and here’s why:
 Companies with a large number of agents create a large listing inven-
tory. As a newer agent, you’ll find it easier to get other agents to let you
work open houses for them if they have 15 rather than two listings apiece.
 Large companies enjoy economies of scale, allowing them to provide a
greater degree of service at a lower price per agent. As a result, they
can offer more training, more advertising, and more exposure than
smaller companies can afford to provide.
46
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 
Passing the buck
I started charging my clients a transaction fee
of $150 in 1993. At that time, I was among the
first in the country to do so, joined only by a few
other high-producing agents. Over the years, I
raised the amount to $495. Today, it’s the real
estate companies who are charging the trans-
action fees to the agents. However, with a little
advance planning and sales tact you can pass
the transaction fees along to your clients.
The first step in being able to charge a transac-
tion fee is believing you’re worth the additional
money. You can’t charge the fee if you don’t
believe in your extra value because you won’t
be able to defend why you’re worth more.
Everyone is quick to point out that real estate
commissions are negotiable. If that’s the case,
why not charge more? If your service is better,
your skills are better, and the outcome for you’re
your clients is achieved with less risk, you’re
worth more money.
To show my value, I explain to clients that when
I first started real estate sales, agents had
three-page agreements, whereas now they
have eight-page agreements. I also note that
agents now have three inspections while before
only one inspection was performed. More pro-
cessing is involved in transactions than ever
before.

 Due to their size, large companies can negotiate better rates for news-
paper ads, Web sites, development costs, click-through ad banners,
and mortgage rates. However, large companies follow no hard and fast
rule for how they direct their savings. Some companies decide to turn a
larger profit margin for the company. Others — the ones you’ll most
want to join — pass on the benefits to their clients and agents.
 Large companies hold a dominant portion of market share in their
communities. As a result, they have the most prominent reputations and
earn the greatest slice of regional business.
In the end, you should base your choice on the office attributes instead of on
the size of the real estate office. However, when two companies have equal
attributes, let size tip your decision to one or the other.
Prioritizing your values and expectations
Before you can determine whether a company is a good match for you, you
have to be clear about your own values and expectations so you can see if
they’re shared and supported by the company you choose to work with.
Know your values
Ask yourself: What are your core values? What beliefs and principles guide
your life? What would you hold dear even if it proved to be a competitive dis-
advantage in the marketplace? Even if the marketplace or business climate
changed, what aspects of how you work are nonnegotiable?
Here’s an example. In my company, Real Estate Champions, one of our core
values is “exceptional execution of the fundamentals.” I believe in and have
seen the truly astounding results that occur when people apply the funda-
mentals of sales and business consistently, without reliance on shortcuts or
miracle marketing systems. In truth, our company commitment to the funda-
mentals means that we attract fewer people. Obviously, it’s easier to sell
agents on magic formulas that require no work, energy, discipline, or rigorous
activity. But, in spite of the competitive disadvantage it presents, our com-
pany belief in disciplined fundamentals doesn’t ever change. It’s a core value
and it’s a truth we adhere to.
When choosing an agency, know what you stand for, what you honor, and
what you believe in. Once you study yourself, you can then study the values
of the company you’re considering to ensure that your belief systems align.
Establish your expectations
What do you expect from yourself over the next 6 to 12 months? What do 
you expect from your company over the same time period? What will your
new company expect from you? What do they consider to be the minimum
47
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

standard for new agent production? What do they consider to be average, or
good, production? What is the most that anyone has ever produced in the
company?
Before you choose a company, align your expectations with the company’s by
taking these steps:
 Set your goals and expectations for the upcoming year. Establish your
targets for gross income, number of transactions, number of listings
taken and sold, and number of buyer sales.
 Know the expectations and typical production levels that exist within
the company you’re considering. If your targets are high, you need to
join a company where established inventories and support systems help
you jumpstart your business for quick success. If your aims are lower,
you need to be sure that they match company expectations for new
agents.
Once you establish your goals, keep them in front of you at all times. Carry
them with you. Put them on your screen saver. Write them on index cards
and stick them on your sun visor, bathroom mirror, TV set, or anywhere else
they’ll catch your eye repeatedly throughout the day.
Narrowing Your Agency Short List
With all the options for where to “hang your license,” you’ll want to shrink
your list down to your top two or three firms quickly so you can really study
each one. The upcoming section will help you winnow it down to the top two
or three.
Do your homework
Follow these steps as you research each of your top-choice companies:
1. Rank your top-choice agencies based on your views as a consumer.
Before you color your opinion with facts or market statistics, ask your-
self: What is each company’s reputation? Based only on information
available to the general public, what impression does the company
make? I tell you to do this because once you join a firm, you automati-
cally acquire this reputation.
2. Evaluate each company’s market share. Determine the portion of all
real estate business that each firm captures in its geographic area. Then
figure out what percentage of the market it commands in the specialized
area in which you’ll be working. (See the sidebar titled “Determining
market share” for some how-to information.)
48
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

Like many real estate agents, I knew I couldn’t cover my whole market
area of Portland, Oregon. I knew that I needed to specialize in specific
bedroom communities and suburbs in order to serve my clients well. In
selecting a company, I first evaluated the firm’s overall Portland market
share to discover its general market strength, but then I also evaluated
the market share it held in the suburban communities I selected.
3. Assess how production is distributed within each company. Ask
whether a number of agents contribute to the company’s success or
whether production is carried by a few agents or even just one person.
I have a coaching client who creates 27 percent of the revenue and 42
percent of the listings in her office. Her leaving would be a huge blow to
the company and the agents whose income is reliant on her presence
and listings. I would advise new agents to steer away from this type of
situation.
49
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency
Determining market share
Before selecting a real estate company, find out
how well it competes in its market area by
determining the share of the market it com-
mands. (If the company you’re considering has
more than one office, work out the numbers for
the office you’re likely to join.)
To assess market share, first get answers to the
following questions:
 How many listings did the company you’re
considering take last year? How many list-
ings did it sell? How many houses did it fail
to sell?
 How many buyer-represented sales did it
make?
 How many agents work at the company?
Then obtain similar statistics for the entire
market area. By dividing the firm’s performance
by the total market area performance, you dis-
cover the firm’s market share. For instance, if
the market area produced 1,000 listings and 400
came from a single company, that company has
a 40 percent market share (400 ÷ 1,000 = .40).
To obtain information, begin by asking each
company to provide you with its statistics. Any
company with a competitive advantage knows
and wants to share its statistics, and many are
also willing to provide comparisons between
themselves and their competition.
Also check with your local board of real estate
agents, where you can access several varieties
of information, including the total number of
agents in the marketplace and the number of
agents per company.
The multiple listing service, or MLS, which com-
piles information on all homes for sale, shares
information on sales, listings, pending transac-
tions, and homes that failed to sell — both on a
market, company, and individual office basis.
For another good resource, consult your local
business journal. Most produce annual lists
ranking companies by industry, and nearly all
have special sections devoted to the real estate
business.

4. Drive around your market area to determine each company’s visibil-
ity. Count the number of signs you see for each firm you’re considering.
Also, evaluate the quality and array of homes presented by each com-
pany. You may discover that a firm has a lot of signs but that they’re all
concentrated in a small geographic area or a specific price range.
Beware of these firms, because they could limit your opportunity. For
example, if a company’s business is concentrated at the lower end of the
marketplace, securing higher-priced listings may be more difficult.
5. Evaluate each company’s advertising. Monitor media for at least a
month to gain a good perspective of the scope and nature of ads being
run. While monitoring the media, do the following:
• Study the large display ads carefully. Often they feature individual
agents. Could you see yourself in these ads?
• Go to the grocery store and pick up copies of real estate maga-
zines. Are the companies you’re considering featured? What do
their ads look like?
If you see many ads paid for by individual agents of your selected
company, each featuring their own listings, you’ll have proof that
you’ll be working with agents who are willing to invest in them-
selves and their businesses.
If you see ads featuring the listings of a number of agents from
your selected company, you’ll know that agents who don’t have
enough listings to fill a whole page (like you in the early days) can
achieve advertising visibility by buying into a company ad on a per
slot basis.
6. Visit the company’s Web site. More than three-quarters of all con-
sumers now search the Web for properties. Is the company’s Web site
easy to use? Are the listings easy to find and navigate? Are agents fea-
tured on individual pages within the company site?
Act like an online shopper and find out if the site performs well in online
searches. Go to major search engines and directories, such as Google,
Yahoo!, MSN, and AOL, and conduct a search for real estate in your
market area. How well a company’s site ranks in the search results will
affect the number and quality of leads you generate.
12 questions to ask each broker
Your moment in front of a prospective broker is a pivotal one: The broker will
be sizing you up to determine whether you fit well in the company. Rather
than treating the session like a job interview, use it to ask questions and
obtain information that allows you to understand the unique attributes of the
agency. Ask the following questions:
50
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

1. What is your training program for new agents? The old school
approach of “Here’s your desk. Here’s your phone. Go get ’em.” won’t
prepare you for success. You’re looking for a legitimate, established,
multi-week training program that extends beyond contract writing and
gets into the fields of prospecting, lead follow-up, sales presentations,
objection handling, and closing techniques.
2. When was the last time you updated your training program?
Follow this question with: What did you change about the program?
Growing companies regularly update training and techniques. If a com-
pany is still teaching the philosophies and techniques of the 1970s in
today’s dramatically changed environment, that’s about all you need to
know.
3. How many new agents do you train annually?
Companies that regularly recruit and train new agents usually have
better training programs than those that don’t.
Find out the success rate of the agents who completed the program. Ask
what percentage of trained agents continues with the company for at
least one year. What percentage lasts two years? As you evaluate the
responses, remember that the North American real estate industry is
coming off the best 36-month run in its history. Because of this record
success, you have to remember to attribute some of the agents’ success
to market conditions rather than to training program quality or agent
skill.
4. Can I talk with a few of your agents?
Try to get the perspectives of four to five agents, including a fairly new
agent, an agent who is struggling to produce, a solid producer, and a top-
performing agent. This diverse group will provide a wonderful view of
the company’s training, education, support, and pathway to success or
failure.
5. How will you help me generate business?
Ask this question and then wait. Give the broker time to think, and
expect to hear responses that fall all over the map. Some make specific
mention of open houses and floor time. Some discuss the frequency and
scope of marketing efforts. Some offer to pay for business cards. Some
send flyers announcing your association with the company to those in
your sphere of influence.
Use the answers to this question to assess
• Whether the company is committed to helping you succeed.
• Whether the company has a system or process that works to gen-
erate business for new agents.
51
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

6. Who do I turn to when I have a question or problem?
As you climb the steep learning curve ahead of you, you need to know
who will help you find solutions to your problems. You need assurance
that the person will be accessible. Make sure to ask whether this person
is available during regular office hours.
7. What type of computer and software is provided for me?
Some companies make numerous high-quality computers available to
agents. Others provide only a dumb terminal, which is merely an access
point for MLS searches. The dumb terminal doesn’t perform any other
type of computer work. Some companies support agents with company
database management programs, intranet sites, Internet sites, and even
electronic marketing pieces or e-cards. With other companies, you’re
completely on your own to purchase the technology tools you need.
8. Do you have regular office meetings?
Most companies still hold weekly sales meetings and, based on the
assessment of our coaching clients, most aren’t very useful. When bro-
kers or managers prepare and conduct staff training, however, the meet-
ings rise to a whole different level of effectiveness. So, be sure to ask
whether the meetings are training or informational sessions.
9. Do you have an agent coaching program?
The hottest, quickest way to improve performance is through coaching.
Coaching provides structure, accountability, performance measuring,
training, and expert guidance. Find out whether the company you’re
considering embraces coaching as a way to increase agent performance.
10. What does it cost me to have my license with you?
Most agents enter real estate with limited cash to invest in a new busi-
ness. Yet they need to fund business cards, errors and omission insur-
ance, MLS fees, board of real estate agents dues, and licensing fees —
which can easily total more than $1,000. Some of these costs must be
paid up front, and others can be withheld from your first commission
check.
11. What’s my commission split?
Save this question until late in your interview. Certainly the answer
affects your immediate-term income, but I think far too many agents put
undue emphasis on the commission split as they make the decision to
“hang their license” with a certain company.
Whether you receive a 50/50 split or a 60/40 split for the first year means
very little over the course of your career. What’s more important to your
success is the investment the company is willing to make in terms of
your training, education, services, leads, and opportunities. The com-
pany deserves a return for the investment it’s making and the risk it’s
taking.
52
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

12. Why should I select this company?
In essence, you’re asking: Why should I join your company over all my
other options? What makes your company better, different, and more
successful?
Raise a caution flag if the broker hesitates, struggles, or rambles with
the answer. If the broker can’t convincingly display belief and conviction
that the company is better, you may have a similarly difficult time
answering if a prospect later asks you the same question.
Making agency comparisons
Once you complete your interviews with company brokers, put your assess-
ments down on paper. On a single sheet, list all your final company candi-
dates, along with their 1 to 10 rankings in each of the following key areas:
 Initial training
 Ongoing education
 Marketplace reputation
 Market share
 Office environment
 Advertising
 Web presence
 Lead generation
 Other agents in the company or office
 Competence of the broker or manager
As you compare companies, weigh a few areas more heavily than the others.
Especially in the early phase of your career, put special emphasis on a com-
pany’s training and education offerings. As a close second, pay attention to
how much the company is prepared to help you with lead generation — based
on the strength of the firm’s Web presence, advertising, and market share.
And the winner is . . .
As you add your scores for each company, give extra points to companies
that rate particularly high in training and lead generation.
Then compare your findings with your initial, first-take impression of each
company’s consumer reputation. Do those with the best reputations also
rank the highest in your assessment?
53
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

If two companies rank extremely closely in your assessment, you may want
to re-interview the broker or another high-ranking manager. Explain that
you’re deciding between two companies. I even suggest that you inform each
company of your other top-contender. This will allow them to prepare their
benefits in direct competition to the other company, which in turn gives you
an indication of their ability to train you in selling based on their presenta-
tion against a direct competitor. Then, once again, ask why you should select
their company over the other. And carefully weigh the answer.
Once you make the final selection, send handwritten thank-you notes to the
companies you didn’t select. Thank each one for the considerable time and
help they provided you. This act alone will position you in the top 5 percent
of agents they’ve ever met. It’ll also keep the door open in case you seek to
work with another firm in the future.
Joining Your New Agency Team
When joining a new team, the objective is to blend in with the team. As an
inexperienced agent, expect scrutiny by your associates. Many will greet you
with a wait-and-see attitude for the simple reason that fewer than one out of
five agents succeed in the long term while the rest wash out of real estate
sales. Your fellow agents are waiting to see which category you’ll fit into.
Building a relationship with your manager
I rarely see a broker or manager with high expectations of a new agent.
Instead, they focus on potential. They believe that a new agent can become a
top producer, but they cautiously reserve judgment until they see the quality
of the agent’s action. The key to success is to quickly move from “potential”
to “performance.”
Even though he’s cautious of judging your performance, your manager is on
your side, rooting and pulling for you to realize your goals, dreams, and
potential.
The best way to build a relationship with your manager is to achieve results
by taking the following steps along the way:
1. Involve your manager as you set your goals.
As you establish specific, concrete, attainable, and exciting goals, ask
your manager for input regarding what you should do daily, weekly, and
monthly to achieve your desired outcomes.
54
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

2. Seek your manager’s input as you lay out an activity plan.
Gain advice regarding which avenues you should follow to achieve suc-
cess and what you should do daily to bring you closer to your goals.
3. Ask your manager to help monitor your activities.
By asking your manager to monitor and coach your performance, 
you separate yourself from 90 percent of the other real estate agents.
While nearly all other agents want to improve, few are willing make the
changes necessary for success.
4. Request a weekly meeting.
Aim to sit down with your manager at the same time and on the same
day each week. Some weeks the meeting may last only 15 minutes,
during which time your manager can review your performance based on
the contacts made, leads generated, appointments booked, appoint-
ments conducted, and properties listed or sold. Other weeks there may
be specific topics for training that you will be working on.
Your manager’s role in your success
Of course you hope for a positive manager who supports you with a high
level of encouragement, but even a negative manager can play a positive role
in your success. It’s counterintuitive, but when a sad-sack manager tells you
that you can’t accomplish your aims, the comment often ignites conviction
and taps into a huge reservoir of “I’ll show you” attitude.
A number of years ago, I coached an agent in Medford, Oregon, named Sheila
Gunderson. She had a burning desire to close $24 million in sales over the
next year. This amount was up from a current sales volume of about $10 mil-
lion and was well above the top performance level of any Medford agent to
date.
Together we constructed a business plan outlining how she would achieve
her $24 million goal. With total excitement she took it to her broker. He
laughed, telling her that no one in the market area had ever come close to
$24 million, and asked her, “Who do you think you are?”
When I heard her manager’s comments, I immediately knew that they would
only fuel Sheila’s fire. And they did. She blew right past the $24 million that
she had projected and she closed at over $27 million, adding more than $17
million in sales to her previous year’s performance.
Whatever input your manager gives you — even if it’s negative — use it to
fuel your fire.
55
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

Earning respect from your manager
Follow this simple formula to earn respect from anyone, including your 
manager:
 Do what you said you would do. Get to the office early each day and be
proactive about prospecting and generating leads. The vast majority of
agents wait for business to come to them and then make excuses for
why it never showed up. Take action instead.
 Improve your knowledge and education. The vast majority of agents
attend training courses to earn continuing education credit (or CE
credit), instead of to learn specific new skills or abilities.
I can’t even count how many times I’ve been asked if the training course
I teach is CE credit approved. I always answer with the same response
and follow-up question. My response is that my course isn’t CE certified
because those who evaluate courses don’t grant CE credit to courses
that teach attendees how to make more money. My follow-up question is
always, “Do you really want a CE credit course, or do you want a course
that teaches agents how to make more money?”
To earn your manager’s respect, attend courses and education sessions
that teach you to make more money. Then implement what you discover
after the session.
Forming partnerships
To get the real estate job done, you’ll form many partnerships — some of
which will last as long as a single deal and others that’ll last for years and
years. In this section, I take a look at those who will join you in the dance of
real estate sales.
Earning respect from your peers
The sales arena — and certainly the real estate sales arena — is a magnet for
those with big egos. To earn the respect of other real estate agents, you have
to perform and succeed. Your peers will base their respect on how they feel
you perform in the following three areas:
 Production growth. When you produce, you get noticed. In fact, many of
your associates will notice your success even before you see a commis-
sion check, because they’ll notice your name on the company listings
board.
At first, they may attribute your success to luck, thinking “He got good
floor calls,” or “He hit a hot streak,” but as your listings keep appearing,
their respect will build.
56
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

Few agents perform consistently over the long haul. Most have a good
month, or quarter, or year, but only a rare few constantly finish at the
top of the income list. However, when you do, your peers will most defi-
nitely notice and share their respect.
 Business ethics. Because the commissions can be large, many people
feel that acting unethically is acceptable. For many agents, money, or the
opportunity to make money, too often exposes character flaws.
Be an exception. Maintaining your values even in the most competitive
situations enhances your own self-respect while also earning the respect
of your peers.
 Life balance. Agents notice and respect other agents who have their pri-
orities in order; who manage not to be controlled by their businesses;
and who carve out good chunks of time to spend with their friends and
families. Few agents manage to earn a large income while also protecting
their personal time. You’ll be recognized and respected as one of the
best agents in the country if you can strike this important balance.
(Check out Chapter 16 for more on making the most of your time.)
Working with agents in your office
Nearly all agents are independent contractors earning no base salary and
depending entirely on their own skills, actions, and activities to create income.
This pay structure breeds competition within the industry and within each
company. The trick is to balance that competition with cooperation.
Striking this balance isn’t always easy. Invariably, you’ll end up competing
with agents inside your own firm for clients and dollars. One example of
many is finding that the agent in the next cubical over is working on the same
lead you are. This situation is usually the result of a prospect who chose to
work with several agents at one time but who didn’t reveal the lack of alle-
giance to any of them. Later, when one agent writes the contract — after both
showed the home — well, you can imagine the office arguments I’ve seen.
This situation certainly presents a moment where a good broker makes a dif-
ference. A good broker can mediate the issues between the agents, making
sure that the client is getting good service while handling all the interper-
sonal issues between the agents.
To succeed in this competitive office environment, follow this advice:
 Use the other agents as mentors. Nearly all agents owe a debt to some
other agent who helped them along the road to success, and they feel a
sense of obligation to repay the favor by being similarly helpful to a new
agent like yourself. Find a mentor. When you do, be respectful of the
mentor’s time, take action on the mentor’s advice or counsel, report
back on the success you achieve, and say thanks over and over again.
57
Chapter 3: Pairing with the Right Agency

 Help other agents serve their clients better. Agents announce their
“haves and wants” — the homes they’re working to sell and the homes
they’re seeking for clients — and few agents even tune in. Be an 
exception. 
I made a lot of money matching haves and wants for other agents. When
I’d hear an agent describe a buyer seeking a three bedroom, three bath-
room, $250,000 home in the Riverside School District, I’d share informa-
tion on my two listings that could work and would ask if they’d shown
them. I’d also mention that I’d seen a great house on Elm Street listed by
another firm that meets the description. By helping the other agent
better serve his clients, I was also serving my clients by generating
showings for them.
 Hold open houses for other agents. Open houses can be burdens on the
schedules of busy agents. Offer to serve as a stand-in host, supporting
your associates while also giving yourself an opportunity to create
prospects and business.
 Ask other agents to work with you on listings. If you lack skill or experi-
ence in a certain price range or geographic area, you risk losing a listing
to a more established agent. Be preemptive instead. Ask a more estab-
lished agent in your firm to co-list the property with you. Through this
short-term partnership you’ll capture the opportunity to expand your
business while you learn and earn.
Cooperating with agents in your marketplace
More than 90 percent of all real estate transactions come through the MLS,
which exposes their availability to agents throughout the marketplace. As a
result, you’re constantly working jointly with agents from other firms to
achieve sales. As you work with these agents from other firms, form coopera-
tive relationships by following this simple advice:
 Deal with the other agents honestly and fairly. Give them the informa-
tion they need about your client or the property without giving too
many details. Always remain aware of the fiduciary responsibility and
privacy protection you owe your client.
 Involve brokers when necessary. If problems arise between you and
the other agent, enlist the help of your broker. If paperwork comes back
too slowly or you feel you’re not getting the full facts, get your broker, or
the other agent’s broker, involved. Move quickly if you sense that a lack
of cooperation is affecting your client’s security in keeping the transac-
tion together.
Developing strategic partnerships
Mortgage originators and loan officers lead the list of strategic partners who
can help you get real estate deals done. These people play an essential role in
securing your clients’ loans. They can help you expand your business
through several avenues:
58
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

 They can help you serve lower-credit clients. Mortgage originators
who are skilled and have a broad line of loan products are open to loan
requests from a broadly diverse economic segment, which increases
your pool of prospects.
 Some mortgage originators invest in joint marketing efforts. These
programs may consist of sending mailers to your sphere of past clients
or to prospects in your geographic area, buying e-mail lists and respond-
ing with e-mail marketing messages, buying Web site ads, or paying for a
banner along the bottom of your real estate magazine ads. Depending on
the arrangement, the mortgage originator may pay for some or all of the
costs involved.
 Mortgage originators can help convert leads. Most agents make the
mistake of getting the mortgage originator involved in a transaction too
late. They wait until after they’ve secured the client relationship to intro-
duce their loan partner. Make the introduction earlier in the lead conver-
sion process. Tandem lead conversion is a powerful strategic partnering
technique.
The odds of lead conversion rise significantly when two strategic part-
ners are working the same contact. Once one of you achieves a face-to-
face meeting, you both win, because either of you can cross-sell the
services of the other.
 The mortgage originator can play the role of a prospect’s professional
advisor. While most prospects view agents as salespeople, their psy-
chology toward mortgage originators is quite different. They tend to see
and trust mortgage originators as consultants rather than as the sales-
people that they truly are. By forming strategic partnerships with your
mortgage originator, you can put that psychology to work and secure
more clients more quickly. I’ve seen agents increase their closed transac-
tions by over 25 percent through this simple tandem lead conversion
approach.
Also form a strategic partnership with your title company. Title representa-
tives can help you conduct research and establish geographic mailing lists.
They also can provide statistics that help you see what homes have sold and
at what prices over past years, including which areas and neighborhoods
have seen the highest number of sales.
Each state and province has different rules regarding how much information
they can share. Check with a title representative or your broker to find out
the possibilities in your market area.

Researching and Understanding
Your Marketplace
In This Chapter
 Discovering the three core rules of real estate
 Collecting and analyzing information on your market area
 Using market knowledge to build your clientele and your personal reputation
H
ere’s a fact: Most real estate agents know too little about the markets in
which they operate. That’s one reason consumers think they know
more than — or at least as much as — their agents do and why they don’t
hold their agents in higher regard.
Now, here’s a tip: You can give yourself an edge over other agents and estab-
lish yourself as a regional real estate expert simply by doing your homework,
researching your market area, and gaining a good understanding of the reali-
ties and trends that affect the real estate decisions of your buyers and sellers.
A new or newer agent faces a steep learning curve to acquire market knowl-
edge. Developing a sixth sense takes time, and that’s what most agents use to
understand the marketplace. However, instead of waiting to acquire the
instincts to make good guesses, you can begin today to acquire data and
knowledge that translates almost immediately to power and influence.
In this chapter, you look at the realities that affect real estate in every market,
regardless of location. Then you discover the steps involved in compiling a
profile of your specific market area, including where to find facts and figures,
how to analyze your findings, and how to put your knowledge to work to
build both your reputation and your clientele.

Three Truths That Rule Every 
Real Estate Market
Whether you’re in a major metro market or a small town and regardless of
the country, the economy, or even the day and age in which you’re doing
business, when you’re in the field of real estate, three core rules apply to
your business:
 Real estate is governed by the law of supply and demand. This rule is
absolute and without exception. The appreciation of a market, the
expectations of buyers and sellers, and the velocity of market sales are
all dictated by the supply of — and the demand for — real estate for
sale.
As a recent example, agents saw rapid appreciation and a frenzied
response by buyers in the U.S. real estate market in the years 2002–2005.
This response was caused by the fact that demand for real estate was at
an all-time high while the supply was limited. This supply and demand
caused rapid appreciation, with home sellers receiving multiple offers
within days or even hours. At one time during that period, homes in
southern California were selling, on average, at 18 percent above the
listed price — the result of a market condition where demand out-
stripped supply.
 Real estate is governed by the law of cause and effect. Put differently,
positive situations cause positive outcomes, and vice versa. For exam-
ple, a vibrant economic growth leads to a vibrant real estate market and
strong appreciation of homes, while loss of jobs and a languishing econ-
omy produce exactly the opposite effect.
As a specific example, as the baby boom generation matured, it fueled
an explosion in second home purchases so strong that more than 21 per-
cent of 2004 U.S. home sales were second home purchases, most
acquired by aging baby boomers. This surge created desire for addi-
tional housing that affected the construction and home values in second
home markets nationwide.
 History repeats itself. In any marketplace, you have cycles. Periods of
rapid real estate appreciation are followed by stagnant periods where
values stabilize or even decrease. By acquiring marketplace knowledge,
you can foresee trends both for your own benefit and for the benefit of
your clients.
For example, in a number of key U.S. market areas, more than 40 percent
of new home loans are being written as low money down, interest-only
mortgages. These limited-equity position purchases are being made on
62
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

the assumption — the gamble — that the recent rapid-appreciation
cycle will continue and that housing prices will climb ever higher. When
the growth trend stops, as it has many times before, home values will
decline, mortgage balances will exceed resale prices, and a large group
of home buyers will be forced to walk away from their homes as banks
foreclose on a significant number of loans. This trend will further lower
values and stagnate growth, as it has many times before.
Acquiring Knowledge about 
Your Marketplace
By knowing your market and watching regional statistics, you’re prepared
and proactive. This section helps you acquire the necessary information.
Think of your marketplace as your playing field, not unlike an athlete views a
football field, basketball court, or hockey rink. The better you know every
inch of that playing field, the more you can exploit it to your advantage.
Collecting marketplace information 
from key sources
The most challenging aspect of gaining market knowledge is determining
what facts to collect and where to find the information you need. Fortunately,
a number of readily accessible resources are available to real estate agents.
All you have to do is contact the right people and ask the right questions.
The following sections help you on your data quest.
63
Chapter 4: Researching and Understanding Your Marketplace
The importance of home field advantage
Before I became a real estate agent, in my early
twenties, I was a racquetball professional. I
played hundreds of tournaments over my sports
career, and always my best games were at my
home club. There, we had a court with floor-to-
ceiling glass on the right side and back wall,
making it particularly difficult to see in the back
right-hand corner where the two walls of glass
converged.
When players came for tournaments at my club,
they struggled to pick up the ball in that corner,
giving me a significant home field advantage. I
rarely lost a match on that court.
Real estate is like any other competitive
endeavor. If you discover all there is to know
about your playing field, you acquire a com-
petitive advantage that distances you from 
the competition and builds the basis of your
success.

Your local real estate board
Most professional agents belong to associations that compile and make avail-
able a wealth of statistical information. The facts you can obtain from your
local board include:
 The number of agents working in your marketplace. This information
helps you to understand your competitive arena. It also allows you to
track whether your competition has expanded or receded over recent
years.
 The production of the average agent in terms of units and volume
sold. By obtaining this information and comparing it with your own pro-
duction units and volume, you’re able to contrast your performance
against the other agents in your local board. This information is useful in
your effort to calculate your share of the market (see Chapter 14 for
more on this topic). It also helps you understand how well you stack up
against the other agents your prospective customer may be considering.
 Experience levels of agents in your field. Most real estate boards keep
information regarding the percentage of agents recently licensed and
those agents with three, five, and ten years in the business. This infor-
mation provides you with another factor against which to measure your
competitive position.
Meet with the executive director of your local board of real estate agents to
find the extent of information that’s available to you, how frequently new
research is released, and how you can obtain copies for your ongoing review.
Your local multiple listing service
The multiple listing service, commonly called the MLS, keeps statistics of all
the listings and sales in your area that are processed through the MLS.
The MLS doesn’t cover every sale due to the fact that some sales bypass the
system. Often, new construction builders, particularly in very robust mar-
kets, don’t submit their inventory into MLS. Agents also sometimes sell prop-
erties themselves or in-house, without submitting those sales to MLS.
However, the MLS in most markets covers more than 95 percent of all market-
place sales, and it represents the surest indicator of real estate activity in
your region.
The MLS can give you key market statistics, including:
 Days on the market averages
 Listing price to sale price ratios
 Listings taken versus listings sold ratios
 Geographically active markets inside your service area
64
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

Nearly all real estate agents recognize the MLS for its significant role in
increasing communication and exposure of real estate properties. Fewer real
estate agents recognize the MLS for its powerful but underutilized role in
reporting trends and performance of agents, companies, and subsets of the
marketplace. Access this information and put it to work to your advantage.
The National Association of Realtors
You can obtain a wealth of knowledge and statistical trends from a number of
national resources. The best is the National Association of Realtors (NAR),
which produces some wonderful studies, reports, and market statistics that
most agents never use. The truth is that most agents don’t even know they’re
available.
The NAR’s monthly Web-based publication, Real Estate Insights, provides a
national view of real estate sales: What’s happened in terms of sales and days
on the market, what people are purchasing, what financing they’re using,
emerging trends, and predictions for the future. This Web-based publication
is a powerful tool in the hands of a successful agent. If you aren’t currently
receiving and reading it, put it into your information arsenal immediately.
The NAR also conducts annual surveys and studies of home sellers and
homebuyers. They delve into why consumers select particular agents; what
services they seek from agents; and what geographic areas, home amenities,
and features cause them to buy. This type of knowledge enables you to pro-
vide the highest level of counsel and value to your clients.
NAR also issues reports on second home markets, investment properties,
financing options, and many other topics. It’s one of the best services that
NAR provides, but it’s the service that agents use the least. Make yourself an
exception and dive into this deep pool of information.
Visit the NAR Web site at www.realtor.org to obtain an overview of the
association, to access quick links to useful sites including REALTOR Magazine
Online, and to subscribe to receive e-mail updates on real estate topics and
statistics.
Other sources of marketplace information
Consult your broker about company-compiled statistics on regional trends
and also on your firm’s market share and market penetration. Especially if
you work for a regional or national real estate company or franchise, your
organization has likely commissioned studies that can be useful to your fact-
gathering efforts.
Also, if you live in a state where sellers provide title insurance to buyers, the
title companies often conduct market trend reports that allow agents to
better understand the marketplace they work in.

Chapter 4: Researching and Understanding Your Marketplace

Analyzing the facts and figures
When you have access to solid facts and figures, take the time to interpret
your findings in order to arrive at conclusions that can steer your business in
the right direction.
This section helps you seek and analyze answers to three important questions:
 What proximate real estate markets are influencing your market area?
 What migratory pattern is your market area experiencing?
 What market trends are you seeing that can help you prepare yourself
and your clients for success?
Determining the influence of other regional markets
Real estate in your market area is affected by influences outside of your own
region.
For example, when I sold real estate in Portland, Oregon, what was happening
in terms of inventory, appreciation, and activity in Seattle, Washington, had
an effect on my own marketplace. The two metropolitan areas are less than
200 miles apart and one influences the other due to the easy and frequent
population movement between the two cities.
The largest regional influence for my market, however, was California. This
influence was caused by a massive influx of people from California to Oregon,
particularly from the bay area of San Francisco and the greater Los Angeles
area. These geographic areas drove tens of thousands of people into the
Portland metro area annually, increasing the demand for homes and raising
values and prices as a result.
The population exodus started because the difference in price between the
Portland market and the California market triggered the law of cause and
effect. The appeal of Oregon’s lower real estate prices caused California resi-
dents to want to move, either to cash out of expensive California properties
and apply the profits to better homes at lower prices in Oregon, or to relo-
cate to an area where they could finally achieve first-time home ownership.
To determine how neighboring regional markets are affecting your market
area, study migratory patterns and then research the reasons behind the
population movements you discover.
Studying population migration patterns
To quantify population migration trends that affect the buyer and seller pool
in your market area, determine the answers to these questions:
66
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

 Is your marketplace growing in population or are people migrating into
your area (possibly due to births, migration, or immigration)?
 Is your marketplace losing population or are people leaving your area
(possibly due to deaths, migration, or immigration)?
 Where are new residents coming from geographically?
 Where are current residents going when they move away?
 At what rate are people arriving or leaving your area?
 What economic factors are driving population changes (such as jobs,
unemployment, and business growth) in your marketplace?
If your answers lead you to believe that a population boom is pending, pre-
pare yourself and your clients to take advantage of a seller’s market and the
positive effects of a high demand, low supply market situation.
Conversely, if your answers lead you to believe that a population exodus is
beginning to take place, you can steer buyer and seller decisions with that
knowledge in mind.
Identifying and capitalizing on market trends
To understand your marketplace and its economic condition, compare cur-
rent market activity with correlating statistics from the previous year:
 Compare number of sales and total sales volume, both on a year-to-
year and on a year-to-date basis. This comparison helps you under-
stand and forecast trends in your marketplace and answer the following
questions:
• Is the number of sales going up or down?
• Is total sales volume going up or down?
• Is the marketplace ahead of or behind the pace of sales from the
previous year?
 Compare the number of listings taken. The available inventory in a
marketplace is the supply half of the supply and demand equation. Now,
ask yourself these questions:
• Is the number of listings up or down? Fewer listings indicate a sell-
ers’ market; many listings indicate a buyers’ market. Do you see
more or less competition for buyers than in previous years?
• Is the selection better for buyers than last year at this time?
• Is the inventory of homes for sale growing or shrinking as com-
pared to this time a year ago?
67
Chapter 4: Researching and Understanding Your Marketplace

 Compare last year’s average sale price to this year’s average sales
price. Determine your market’s average sale price by dividing total sales
revenue by the number of homes actually sold. Knowing the average
price helps you answer the following:
• Is the average sale price going up or down? If a marketplace is
healthy and vibrant, the average sale price is increasing.
• Is your marketplace appreciating or depreciating in value? For
instance, if the average sale price has gone from $249,000 to
$257,000, your marketplace is appreciating in value.
Be aware that the average sale price must be viewed on at least a
quarterly basis. A one-month change in this particular statistic a
month doesn’t indicate a sustainable trend. This fact is especially
true in small market areas.
• How well is the inventory of homes aligned with demand? If you
have an appreciating marketplace, the inventory probably is lower
than the demand for homes. In a flat or depreciating marketplace,
the inventory or supply probably exceeds demand at this time.
 Compare the percentage of appreciation of average sales price this
year versus last year and year to date.
• Is the appreciation percentage increasing or decreasing compared
to this time last year?
• Is the marketplace gaining strength in appreciation or losing its
power?
To understand your marketplace and its economic condition, create a market
trends analysis by comparing current market activity with correlating statis-
tics from the previous year.
68
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 
Using facts to enact change
A few years ago a large national real estate
brand conducted a survey of all their buyers and
sellers. They studied the satisfaction levels of
clients before, during, and after the sale. They
then surveyed the clients to discover what, if
anything, they thought was missing in the serv-
ices they were receiving.
And then they went a step further. Instead of
stopping with success and resting on their lau-
rels, the researchers looked to see what new
opportunities the facts were unveiling.
From this study and others like it came the birth
of one-stop shopping in real estate.
Today, one-stop shopping — where the con-
sumer can find a real estate agent, mortgage
originator, and escrow and title insurance all
under one roof — is proving a huge conve-
nience to consumers and a major business
expansion opportunity to agents. All because
someone took the time to ask, listen, interpret,
and then act on market research and findings.

Compiling a marketplace analysis
Before delving into your own marketplace analysis, check to see whether
your local real estate board or MLS compiles monthly reports on your mar-
ketplace. If so, save yourself a lot of time by using the statistics they can pro-
vide on the current homes for sale in your area, which are often broken into
regional geographic areas.
If the essential data isn’t available, sharpen your pencil, clear some calendar
time, and follow these steps to construct the analysis on your own on a
monthly basis:
1. Segment your marketplace by area.
You need to acquire both a macro view of the whole marketplace and
micro view of selected neighborhood or school boundary areas. The
broader view is helpful, but the close-in view on specific market areas is
essential when you’re showing particular properties to clients.
I feel the easiest way to create segmented market profiles is to track real
estate performance using the existing MLS segmented geographic regions,
because the real estate data is already aligned in that format. Or, as an
alternative, use the same segmentation featured in your newspaper’s real
estate classified ads, as that aligns with common market knowledge.
2. Determine available inventory levels.
Know the level of competition for your buyer’s dollars by tracking the
number of active listings on the market for sale. In most normal market-
places, about 65 to 70 percent of the inventory sells. However, these per-
centages climb higher (even to 90 percent) when inventory levels are low.
These sale percentages are affected by the market’s inventory levels.
3. Calculate the number of transactions in the last 30 days.
To get an accurate picture of marketplace activity, look at the number of
pending transactions for properties that are in the process of closing
and transferring ownership. In most markets, a property remains as a
pending transaction for 30 to 60 days, after which time the money and
ownership is transferred, and the deal is referred to as closed or sold.
Analyzing the market based on pending rather than closed or sold prop-
erties is important because the completed transactions reflect the activ-
ity of the marketplace 30 to 60 days ago rather than right now.
In a marketplace that’s active or even volatile, dramatic changes can
occur over a time span of 60 days. Earlier this year in one of my client’s
marketplaces, the inventory of homes for sale went up by over 40 per-
cent in less than 60 days, and pending sales went down by 29 percent. If
my client had been tracking sold or closed properties, she wouldn’t
have understood the reality of the marketplace for another 60 days.
Because she was watching pending activity, though, she was able to
counsel her clients about the changes and acquire price reductions on
69
Chapter 4: Researching and Understanding Your Marketplace

her listings before other agents in her marketplace recognized what had
happened. She ended up saving her sellers money by acting quickly and
decisively.
4. Calculate the absorption rate, or how many months it takes for the
currently available inventory to be purchased.
This last calculation is an important one. By taking the current inventory
level and dividing it by the number of pending properties, you can calcu-
late how many months worth of inventory are for sale in your market
area. This calculation provides a snapshot of current supply and demand.
For example: If 250 homes are for sale in a given geographic area with 50
of them pending this last month, take 250 divided by 50 to end up with 5.
This number means the marketplace has five months worth of inventory,
provided that no other homes come on the market in that time. You know
that more homes will be listed for sale, but you have to use some baseline
for analysis. The resulting determination that the market has a five-month
housing inventory indicates a good market, but certainly not a great one.
In contrast, one of my clients in southern California sent her market stats
recently, showing 110 properties available with 228 pending on a monthly
basis. That’s quite a different and more robust marketplace than one with
250 actives and 50 pendings. One has five months worth of inventory, and
one has less than two weeks. Now ask yourself these questions:
• Which market do you think is appreciating faster?
• Which market allows the seller greater control?
• In which market do homes spend fewer days for sale?
• In which market do buyers have the least control and the greatest
need to meet seller demands in order to make the purchase?
• Which marketplace inspires the greatest seller greed?
• In which marketplace do the sellers put more pressure on agents
to cut their commission rate?
The marketplace with two weeks of inventory is the right answer to all
these questions.
If you know the numbers, you can know the future of your marketplace. The
trends are predetermined by your monthly analysis. Don’t leave your office
without one!
Projecting trends on the horizon
Most real estate trends are a reaction to the law of supply and demand. As
you project trends, study your market analysis for hints of changes in your
market’s inventory. At the same time, study your region’s economic growth
and stability for hints at what’s taking place to influence consumer demand.
70
Part I: Acquiring the Keys to Real Estate Success 

In general, a low inventory of homes leads to increased appreciation and
more competition for “high demand” properties, which include homes that
are in superior condition and in superior locations. In a low inventory mar-
ketplace, sellers can often overreach in terms of pricing. When inventory
levels are high, the competition for buyers slows appreciation. It also extends
days on the market and can even drop sales prices due to a lack of purchaser
urgency to “buy now.”
Putting Your Findings to Work
Most agents, even the good ones, are far from being experts in their field.
They create clients and sales through strong relationships rather than
through superior knowledge and expertise. To differentiate yourself, acquire
a deep understanding of current and emerging market trends and then share
your findings with prospects, current and past clients, and others in your
sphere of influence. Doing so helps you position yourself as a leading expert
in your market area. (For more on the important topic of how to stake your
market position, flip to Chapter 14.)
Whether you’re making contact by phone or in person, get the conversation
going by presenting questions that prompt interest, inspire urgency, and
convey your market knowledge and authority. For example:
 Are you aware that we have less than two weeks of inventory in the
price range you’re looking for?
 Did you know that the average home price has appreciated over 15 per-
cent in the last six months, meaning that this same home you called
about today would have been $25,000 less six months ago?
 Has anyone told you that, on average, a high-demand house is on the
market only 21 days in today’s environment?
After you seize a client’s interest, immediately ask for an appointment to
meet due to the marketplace inventory being low or high, appreciation being
low or high, the days on the market being low or high, or other market condi-
tions that work to your favor.
Let me share with you a script example.
“Bob, did you know that the average home price in your area has risen over
15 percent in the last six months? Here’s what that means to you: This same
home we’re talking about right now would have been $25,000 less if you’d
called me six months ago. Based on the trends in the marketplace, we
should get together right away. I’m sure you don’t want to lose another
$25,000 in the next six months. Would Wednesday or Thursday this week be
better for you to meet?”
71
Chapter 4: Researching and Understanding Your Marketplace

Sharing your market research 
to build prospect relationships
The use of key statistics, such as list price to sales price ratios, days on the
market averages, and absorption rates, demonstrate your mastery of market-
place knowledge. It also creates a competitive gap between you and your
competition by establishing you as the one who can use market forces to
your client’s advantage, raising the probability of a higher sales price, a
shorter the time on the market, and increased net proceeds.
To put your findings to work, do the following:
 Use your marketplace knowledge to prompt prospects to act now
instead of procrastinating until a time when market conditions may
not be so ideal.
 Share your market analyses as a way to stay in contact with past clients
and others who can positively influence your business. Most of these
individuals already own real estate, so they’re “vested” and interested in
the local marketplace. For many, their single largest investment asset is
their home. They care about the market’s equity position and apprecia-
tion. What’s more, most aren’t in their final home for life. They at least
secretly wish for a better house in a better neighborhood. By establishing
and reminding them of your expertise, you place yourself in position to
counsel them on future home or investment property purchases.
 Quarterly, assemble and mail your most recent statistical findings to
your business contact list. While other agents are sending out recipe
cards and other trash and trinket items, you’re sharing something of real
value: the state of the real estate market and the state of your recipients’
major financial holdings — their homes.
Distributing your findings 
to gain publicity
Another way to enhance your credibility and public image is to publish your
monthly or quarterly market analysis in the form of a newspaper display ad.
A week before the ad breaks, deliver your market analysis and trends projec-
tion to the journalist who handles real estate coverage for your local newspa-
per. Your findings may or may not make their way into a news story, but by
furnishing the report on a regular basis, you establish yourself as a regional
authority who can be called upon for real estate quotes or interviews. The
effort costs you nothing but pays off by elevating your stature in the commu-
nity. Nothing is better than a third party validation to cement your status as
an expert in your marketplace.

Prospecting for
Buyers and Sellers

In this part...
P
rospecting is the one and only sure-fire pathway to
real estate success, and this part gives you the road
map to follow. The chapters in this part tell how, why, 
and when to make contact with prospects, how to turn
prospects into leads, how to secure face-to-face appoint-
ments, and how to convert prospects to buyer or listing
clients.
I’m a prospecting enthusiast because I know from experi-
ence that prospecting drives sales and that sales drive
you straight to your income goals. In the next five chap-
ters, I share how to establish and follow your prospecting
plan, how to mine gold from referrals, and how to tap the
wide-open prospecting opportunities presented by expired
listings and FSBOs, or homes listed for sale by owners.
Chapter 8 focuses on nothing but open houses, which are
considered by most successful real estate agents as long-
shot selling tools. However, I’ve found that open houses
serve as  solid prospecting opportunities.
Chapter 9 winds up the prospecting cycle with a complete
rundown of the steps and techniques you need to know in
order to qualify leads, make presentations, handle objec-
tions, and close the listing or selling contract, thereby
securing the business and moving yourself a giant step
closer to a sales commission.

P
rospecting is one of the easiest but most misunderstood concepts in the
field of sales.
Daily, sales trainers try to sell their “prospecting-free systems” on worldwide
speaking circuits saying, basically, “You will never have to prospect again if
you use my system.” And because salespeople secretly don’t like prospect-
ing, they readily buy into the too-good-to-be-true no-prospecting philosophy.
As a salesperson, if you buy into the myth of a prospecting-free sales system,
failing to learn sound prospecting approaches and abandoning the need to
continually develop new leads, you end up chasing false promises and endan-
gering your livelihood in the real estate business.
What Prospecting Is — and Isn’t
Webster defines prospecting as “seeking a potential customer; seeking with a
vision of success.” Notice that nothing in that definition deals with waiting or
hoping. Starting with the word “seeking,” the definition revolves around
action being taken by the salesperson. In its most basic sense, prospecting
involves finding people to do business with.

The other key phrase is “with a vision of success.” Prospecting requires positive
expectations. It requires a positive-results mindset, in part to overcome the
influences of all the other agents who don’t prospect, don’t value prospecting,
and stand by to negatively influence your vision and expectation of success.
Take a look at Table 5-1 to get an idea of which agent activities are considered
prospecting and which aren’t.

Prospecting is the pathway to sales success
As a new real estate agent in 1991, I joined an
office full of experienced agents who were
doing well. I knew that to succeed I needed to
prospect. I didn’t know much more than that,
but I understood the value of prospecting
based on the results I’d experienced in my pre-
vious sales jobs.
I’d come into the office at 7 a.m. and by 8 a.m.
I’d be talking to expired listings, FSBOs, people
within my sphere of influence, or whoever else
I could reach on the phone. The snickering from
the other offices didn’t escape my notice, nor
did it redirect my efforts. The laughing died
down within six months when my listings and
sales put me on the top-performing lists — and
it stopped altogether when I made over six fig-
ures in my first year in the business. I became
the number one agent in that office after my
third year in the business. And my commitment
to prospecting hasn’t stopped yet.

Prospecting for Listings versus Buyers
The purpose of prospecting is to develop prospective clients for your busi-
ness. The real estate prospecting process involves the following two-steps:
1. Identifying and creating leads by establishing contacts with people
who have interest in what you’re offering and who have the ability 
to become clients of your business.
2. Securing face-to-face appointments for predetermined times in the
future.
Real estate agents seek two categories of clients: sellers, who become listing
clients, and buyers, who become real estate purchasers. The following sec-
tions provide tips for how to prospect for clients in each group.
Prospecting for listings
Listing leads come from past clients, those in your sphere of influence,
expired listings, FSBO conversions, open houses, lead cultivation, and door
knocking, but they rarely come without some effort, and here’s why: The ten-
dency when people send you referrals is to send you prospective buyers. The
public’s perception is that real estate agents sell houses by putting people in
their cars and driving them around to look for a home to buy.
To generate listing leads, you have to do some pretty active prospecting
work, such as the following:
 Use your networking skills. Specifically ask those within your sphere of
influence, your circle of past clients, or your referral groups to share the
names of people who need or want to sell real estate.
77
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales

 Gather up expired and FSBO listings. To achieve a greater listing inven-
tory and develop a specialty as a listing agent, cultivate listing prospects
by working with expired and FSBO listings (flip to Chapter 7 for the full
rundown on how to excel in this area).
 Prioritize your efforts. You must prioritize your investment of time
based on the probability of your success. Prioritizing must be done
based on activity as well as the prospect. Some prospects warrant a
larger investment of time and resources because of their short time
frame, their higher level of commitment to you, or the amount of com-
mission you will receive from them.
Prospecting for buyers
Prospecting for buyers is easier than prospecting for listings because refer-
rals arrive more naturally and because open houses attract prospective
buyers and provide you with a great prospecting platform.
If you’re short on buyer prospects, increase the frequency of your open
houses. (Chapter 8 provides a complete how-to guide.)
The type of houses you choose to show determines the kinds of prospects
you generate. Obviously, higher priced and more exclusive properties draw
more discerning buyer prospects, while lower priced properties attract less
affluent prospects.
To build your business quickly, work to generate leads from more first-time
home buyers by planning more open houses in the low range of your market-
place. First-time buyer prospects benefit your business because they
 Can be sold into homes quickly, since they aren’t burdened with the
need to sell homes in order to make purchases possible.
 Lack experience with other real estate agents. They don’t have current
agent affiliations, and they don’t approach a new agent relationship with
the baggage acquired from a less-than-stellar past experience.
 Acquire strong loyalty when good service is rendered. This allows you
to establish a long-term relationship that may span 10 to 15 years with
multiple home sales and purchases over that period.
 Provide you with an opportunity to establish relationships with their
friends who may also be considering first-time purchases.
78
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

The Four Pillars of Prospecting
For long-term prospecting success, apply the following four disciplines that
are common to agents who consistently achieve their revenue and quality of
life goals.
1. Set a daily time and 
place for prospecting
You can’t work your prospecting around your day. You have to work your day
around your prospecting. You have to establish the habit and engage in the
discipline of prospecting on a daily basis and from a controlled environment
where your prospecting tools are available and readily accessible. To para-
phrase from the ’60s hit Batman, prospecting success is all about the “same
bat time, same bat channel.”
In my private office, I set up a prospecting station that included a stand-up area,
a computer, and telephone with a headset. Knowing that body language com-
prises 55 percent of the power of communication, even when communicating by
phone, I kept my intensity and focus high by standing up. The headset — which
I consider an absolutely essential prospecting tool — enabled me to keep my
hands free so I could gesture or accentuate points as if I were speaking directly
to my prospect in person.
When making an investment in a headset, don’t get the cheapest one you can
find. Spend a few hundred dollars to get one of high quality. Otherwise, you’ll
end up with such poor sound quality that your prospect won’t be able to
hear you clearly — that would hardly be a formula for prospecting success.
To increase my efficiency, I tacked scripts on one wall of my prospecting sta-
tion for use when contacting expired listing and FSBO prospects, past clients,
those in my sphere of influence, and those who I reached via cold calls. On
another wall, I posted all of my objection-handling scripts, including a few
options for each objection. Having these scripts handy kept me prepared for
any dialogue or for any direction the conversation took, and allowed me to
avoid fumbles. For more on objection handling techniques, turn to Chapter 9.
2. Fight off distractions
The truth is that most agents welcome distractions that take them away from
prospecting obligations. An inbound phone call, a problem transaction, a
79
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales

home inspection question, an incoming e-mail, an agent who wants to talk, a
broken nail — anything will do. This tactic is called creative avoidance, and
agents (like college students) generally excel at this art form.
Whether you’re just starting out or whether you’re a top agent in your
market, distractions never go away. In fact, the best agents have even more
potential for distraction because of the volume of business they carry, the
number of staff members they manage, the size of their client roster, and the
scope of the responsibilities they juggle.
The difference between prospecting avoidance and prospecting success
comes down to the following question: What do you do when the distractions
hit? Do you postpone prospecting while you put out fires? Do you decide to
make just a few calls to settle the pending issue? If you said yes to any of
those questions, you’re practicing creative avoidance.
To fight off distractions, you have to bar their access by doing the following:
 Turning off your e-mail so the “you’ve got mail” icon doesn’t tempt you.
 Asking the receptionist to take messages for inbound calls during your
prospecting sessions.
 Turning off your cell phone and pager.
 Putting a sign on the door that basically says, “Don’t bother me. I’m
prospecting.”
 Telling anyone who asks for a meeting during your prospecting period
that you already have an appointment, because you do — you have an
appointment to find a potential prospect.
3. Follow the plan
Success boils down to taking the right steps in the proper order.
To get your prospecting steps and order correct, you must have, and follow, a
prospecting plan. You must know who you’re going to call each day and for
what reason. The best approach is to set up each day’s prospecting plan a
day in advance.
If you wait to put your prospecting plan together at the beginning of your
prospecting session, chances are too high that you’ll talk yourself out of
more calls than you make. Your mental process will get in the way of action,
causing you to think things, such as “This person will think I’m calling back
too soon” or “This person won’t buy or sell right now.”
80
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

If you establish a plan in advance, you’ll be ready for action, rather than for
second-guessing. To be successful in your prospecting, follow these steps:
1. Do your research, establish your plan, and set up for the next day’s
prospecting a day in advance.
Before you leave your office for the day, determine the prospecting calls
you’re going to make the next day. Assemble everything you’ll need for
the calls and put the information on your desk so it’s ready for your
attention as soon as you walk in the door.
2. In the morning, quickly review your calls and your daily goals.
A word to the wise: Don’t take too long to review! You could be setting
yourself up for creative avoidance.
3. Spend 20 minutes before each prospecting session practicing scripts,
dialogues, and objection-handling techniques.
Establish a pre-call routine and create a pattern or plan that you repeat
over and over again before each prospecting session or call.
As an analogy, think of how professionals warm up before performances.
Whether you’re watching musicians, actors, or athletes, you expect them
to be fully prepared and ready to go when their concerts, plays, or games
begin. Follow the same rule. Warm up in advance so that by the time you
pick up the phone, practice is over and you’re ready for the real thing.
4. Review a few affirmations like:
• “I’m a great prospector.”
• “When I prospect, people love to talk with me and set appoint-
ments with me.”
• “I will generate leads and appointments before I’m through today.”
You’re now ready to pick up the phone with focus, intensity, and an expecta-
tion of success.
Make sure you’re staying within the bounds of the No Call laws. See the side-
bar titled, “Keep it legal! Following the rules of the No Call law” in Chapter 7
for more details.
4. Be faithful to yourself 
and finish what you start
Stay faithful to your daily objectives by completing all of your prospecting
contacts down to the very last one. Don’t settle for less than your daily goal.
81
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales

If you set a goal to make five contacts a day, make the five. Don’t stop at four
and say that you had a good day.
For example, when you’re running a race, you have to run the whole way. No
one remembers who was ahead at the 80-meter mark of the men’s 100-meter
race at the Olympics. The winner has to complete the full circuit before he
can claim his medal. Don’t drop out early; finish what you start.
Putting Prospecting to Work for You
You can work harder. Or you can work smarter. Most successful agents don’t
go into a secluded room, pick up the phone, and toil away making hundreds
of random calls nonstop over an 8-hour period. Few people would even con-
sider that approach. I know I wouldn’t, and I doubt you would either.
Instead, those who win at prospecting begin by targeting who they’ll call and
why. They don’t waste their time or effort calling iffy contacts that may or
may not even be in the real estate market.
Prospecting is only effective if it generates a lead from a truly qualified
prospect — someone who is interested in what you offer, needs the service
you provide, and has the ability and authority to become a client of your
business or to refer you to someone who could.
And that’s where targeting, and the upcoming section, comes to your rescue.
Targeting prospects
In targeting, you’re looking for the prospects that have the highest probability
of buying or selling in the shortest amount of time. Some easy sources that all
agents should target are past clients and those in their sphere of influence (the
people they know). Also worth targeting are expired listings, FSBO’s, and refer-
ral sources, which generate referral business for you.
Market conditions also can create targets for agents. With each change,
opportunities are created for a segment of the marketplace. You may have a
marketplace where the high-end properties aren’t selling quickly. However,
maybe the middle range is robust in activity and sales. The prospect who
sells in the middle of the marketplace to move to the high end has an oppor-
tunity to sell high and buy low due to inventory and activity levels of the mar-
ketplace. This type of prospect would be a great target.
82
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Setting and achieving prospecting goals
In setting your own prospecting goals, focus on three core areas:
 The number of contacts you should make each day and week
 The number of leads you should develop
 The number of personal appointments you should set
Start with easily attainable numbers so that you can build up your energy, 
intensity, focus, and discipline slowly and steadily. You wouldn’t decide to run a
marathon without working your daily and weekly mileage up over time, and the
same premise applies when establishing and meeting your prospecting goals.
83
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales
Right on target: Real-life targeting success
Here’s a recent example of the power of target-
ing. I work with an agent on the East Coast.
She’s an ace when it comes to monitoring her
marketplace (see Chapter 4 to conduct your
own market research) and as a result she
wasn’t surprised when she saw her market’s
housing inventory swell significantly over a 90-
day period. For months she’d watched the
momentum of the marketplace wane, but over
the most recent 90 days the effect had shown
up in the box score. During a coaching call she
said, “It’s over.” What she was saying was that
the rapid appreciation and insane marketplace
frenzy had come to a rapid end.
In the face of the market correction or bubble
break, I asked her, “Based on this market
change, who should become your new target
for prospecting?” After a few minutes of dis-
cussion, she aimed her focus on her next
prospects: Absentee owners, which are people
who don’t live in the property that they own.
They may be homeowners of a second home
that is only used seasonally or on a part-time
basis or may be investors who rent the property
for income and appreciation. My client correctly
determined that once they became aware of the
changing tide, absentee owners would most
likely want to realize their profits before prices
dropped further.
My client made a decision to call these listing
prospects. She would share the market evalua-
tion, inventory, and absorption rates. Then she
would ask if they wanted to risk all the equity
and appreciation they had gained or if they
wanted to sell and lock in their gains. As part of
her script, she would also ask owners whether,
with appreciation flattening or potentially
declining, they might find the rental manage-
ment, headaches, and repair hassles not worth
the benefits of continued ownership.
Almost immediately, my client launched her
new prospecting plan. Within 90 days of our
call, she had listed ten absentee-owner proper-
ties, with another 50 leads that she expected to
list in the next 12 months.
Her success was based largely on focused
target-based marketing. She went after the right
people at the right time and achieved tremen-
dous results.

Number of contacts made
When I take on a new coaching client, I almost always start them with a goal
of five contacts a day, and I would suggest the same for you. Make a goal of
five contacts a day without fail, resulting in the completion of 25 contacts a
week. Note: A contact is a personal conversation with a decision maker who
can make a purchase or sale or who might refer you to someone who could. 
A contact is not a conversation with the babysitter, a 10-year-old neighbor, a
friendly teenager, or an answering machine.
It may take three to four weeks for you to get into the habit of contacting five
prospects a day. However, once you’re able to achieve that goal for three weeks
straight (without missing a single workday), you can raise your goal to seven
or ten contacts a day.
Number of leads established
Leads are contacts that have demonstrated through their dialogues that they
possess the basic motivation and desire to make a change in their living
arrangements. When prospecting, until you either pre-qualify them yourself
or they secure an appointment with a lender that determines they have the
financial capacity to make a purchase, assume they have the ability to buy.
To advance your business, you should aim to develop at least one lead per
day and five leads per week.
Number of appointments secured
An appointment is a face-to-face meeting with prospects during which you
 Discuss their needs and wants.
 Share your working style.
 Aim to gain their commitment to work with you in an exclusive relation-
ship to sell their home or find them a home to purchase.
An appointment is the launch of the agent-client relationship. It isn’t a meet-
ing during which you show a property.
Like your lead-generation goal, your appointment goal should be set at a rea-
sonable level: A goal of one appointment a week is a solid start. If you acquire
two appointments, terrific, but make sure you can secure at least one.
Putting it all into perspective
If about now you’re wondering, “Hmm, five leads and only one appointment a
week from all those calls,” realize that these are starting goals. It’s far better
84
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

to begin with aims that you can actually achieve rather than ones that over-
whelm you from the onset. As you gain consistency and skill in prospecting,
both your numbers and your ratios will improve.
Too many agents burn out quickly when trying to prospect because their
expectations, in terms of numbers of contacts and the results of those con-
tacts, are too grand. Start small and work up to avoid frustration and burn
out. Overestimating what you can do in a day or even a week is easy to do.
But, remember, it’s just as easy to underestimate what you can accomplish 
in a month, quarter, or year.
Even if you simply maintained the goals and sales ratios of leads and appoint-
ments you set from the start, you would have a good year as a newer or inex-
perienced agent. At the end of the year, you would have made 1,250 contacts
and created 250 leads. You also would have set and conducted 50 appoint-
ments and would have had two weeks off with your family to boot.
If only half of the appointments turned into listings or sales, you would have
25 deals in your first year. In most companies, that would make you rookie 
of the year. You would also earn more than $125,000 in gross commission
income. I don’t know too many people in real estate or in any other profes-
sion that make that type of money in their first year.
Shattering the myths
You’ve heard at least some of the reasons that agents use to avoid adopting
sound prospecting techniques. “My market is different” or “You don’t under-
stand how we do things here in Mayberry” are among the many. The truth is
that the techniques in this chapter work in every market area, everywhere in
the world, at any point in time. So, bury the myths, especially with the ones
that follow.
There’s a magic pill . . .
Real estate success is built on a series of fundamentals. One of those funda-
mentals is prospecting.
Plenty of people work to sell agents on some magic pill they can take to avoid
the fundamental need to prospect. These people are greeted by a willing
market, since many agents secretly want, and hope for, a prospecting-free
existence — just as people secretly hope those guys on the late-night
infomercials are right that they can buy a home for no money down at below
market prices, or that if people pop one pill they can eat whatever they want
and not have to work out, while still losing weight and gaining a sculpted
85
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales

body. Dream on. You won’t find a magic mailing program, calendar, magnet,
marketing piece, or Web site that makes up for the fundamental need to pick
up the phone and start prospecting for new clients.
Success without work: Does it really exist?
Agents are quick to share with you how they got where they are today, pas-
sionately describing their techniques, the people who helped them, or the
products that made the difference.
While a few of these agents can tell you the cause and effect link between
their actions or techniques and their sales and revenue, more than 95 per-
cent truly have no idea or can’t quantify their success for you.
Your job is to pull the curtain back to reveal the truth about gimmicks. In the
movie The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy, The Tin Man, The Scarecrow, and The
Cowardly Lion were all mesmerized and scared of the great and powerful Oz.
It took a small dog named Toto to reveal that Oz was a little man pulling
levers and using a sound system to produce the semblance of greatness and
power. The same is often true in real estate sales: The magical marketing,
advertising, and promotion gimmicks only work when someone is doing the
behind-the-scenes work. The guys pulling the prospecting levers will always
make their own magic.
In the future, when someone approaches you with great and powerful business-
generating techniques, pull back the curtain with these questions:
 How many transactions does this technique generate for you annually?
 How much time do you need to invest to set this technique up and main-
tain it?
 How much does it cost you to use this marketing service to generate
leads?
 What is the conversion ratio on this technique?
 What percentage of your business comes from this activity?
 How many buyers have you gained from this approach?
 How many sellers have you gained?
 What is your net profit from this activity after all your costs are 
subtracted?
 Have you included the value of your time in that equation?
86
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Most people (whether they’re other agents, your broker, other trainers, or
sales gurus) won’t be able to answer most of these questions. However,
they’re all sure that what they’re advocating is the cat’s meow for you and
your business.
Top producers don’t prospect . . .
This myth is based on some truth. Many top-performing agents don’t prospect
once they’ve “made it” as agents. But you’ll be hard-pressed to find top pro-
ducers who got where they are without prospecting at earlier stages in their
careers. And you’ll be even harder-pressed to find top producers who can
weather the swings and changes of the marketplace without going back into
prospecting mode at least occasionally.
To become a top producer, you must prospect. And to remain at the top of
your game, you must continue to prospect. Don’t ever quit prospecting!
As you become more and more successful at real estate sales, you may even
do more prospecting, in part because prospecting becomes more natural and
is easier than ever. As you acquire name recognition and market presence,
the people you contact are increasingly honored and pleasantly surprised to
receive your calls. They know that you’re busy and successful, and they
respond not only with their own business, but with many referrals as well.
87
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales
If it seems too good to be true, it probably is
I recently received a marketing piece from an
agent touting his approaches to business. He’d
sold 60 homes in his third year in the business —
a very respectable number. Based on his per-
sonal success, he was promoting his lead-gen-
eration model as better than prospecting
because he did 60 deals and generated over
1,200 leads a month. The average agent would be
frothing at the mouth to achieve those numbers.
I immediately grabbed my calculator and did the
math. He generates over 14,400 leads a year,
which means his 60 transactions represents a
lead-conversion rate of .004167 — that’s less
than 1⁄2 of 1 percent. In other words, he has con-
verted only one person out of 240 leads that
were generated through his so-called “prospect-
ing technique.”
You can come to only two logical conclusions:
The leads he’s generating are marginal at best,
or he’s really poor at securing face-to-face
meetings and subsequent deals. I’ll leave you to
draw your own conclusion.

My clients and friends don’t want to be bothered . . .
Agents who use this excuse are focusing almost exclusively on the canvass-
ing (asking the friend or client to make another purchase from you), or refer-
ral portion of the call, rather than on the connection the call allows with a
long-established associate.
Wouldn’t you be delighted to get a call from your accountant, doctor, dentist,
or insurance agent, asking about you and your family, thanking you for your
business, and seeing if you needed anything?
I bet you can count on one hand the amount of times in the last 20 years you
have received a call like that. If you have received a call like this, you were
probably stunned, but appreciative. Your sphere of influence, past clients,
and other associates would feel the exact same way.
Every time I work with a new client, I hear the same excuse for not prospect-
ing: They don’t want to bother anyone. Then they prospect for a week and
when I talk with them again, they always say the same thing: “I was amazed
how easy it was. My clients were really happy to talk with me. I couldn’t get
them off the phone. It was great to catch up.”
Finding Safety and Success in Numbers
Real estate sales is a numbers game. Prospecting is a numbers game, as 
well. The problem is, too few agents actually know their numbers and how 
to track them.
This section helps you understand and set objectives for your ratios of con-
tacts to leads, leads to closings, appointments to contracts, and contracts to
closings. Knowing this information moves you almost immediately into the
league of our industry’s most productive agents.
The law of accumulation
The law of accumulation basically says that achievement is the result of ongo-
ing and constant effort. Everything in life, whether positive or negative, com-
pounds itself over time.
An illustration of this involves money. If you want to be a millionaire, all you
have to do is save a little on a consistent basis and the law of accumulation
88
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

takes over. If you put away $2.74 a day from the time you were 20 until you
were 65 and you received an average rate of return of 9 percent over those
years, you would be a millionaire. You would’ve saved about $45,000 over
those 45 years; the law of accumulation did the rest. If you asked most people
whether they would trade $45,000 for $1 million they would, of course, say
yes, but few people would make the effort of saving consistently on their own.
You can expect an equally incredible return when you invest in prospecting.
The catch is that the reward for your miniscule investment of prospecting
effort doesn’t happen overnight. You have to prospect for 90 days before the
law of accumulation does its thing. The benchmark is 90 days because it
takes that long to build up enough leads in your database. Agents also only
get paid at the end of the transaction, and it usually takes at least 30 days to
close a transaction once a buyer and seller agree to terms. Finding a home for
a buyer or finding a buyer for a property you’ve listed often takes at least 30
days. You have to put in the effort before you can expect compensation. As
my good friend Zig Ziglar says, “Life is like a cafeteria. First you pay, and then
you get to eat.” In other words, life isn’t like a restaurant where you eat your
fill and then the bill comes.
The power of consistency
Marginally successful agents take a binge approach to prospecting. Highly
successful agents are far, far more consistent in their efforts.
I can’t think of an agent who better exemplifies the power of consistency 
than a man I met in 2000 by the name of Rich Purvis. Rich had entered the
field of real estate after 25 years in a fire-fighting career. His goal was to earn
$100,000 that year, and when I met him in March his income was standing at a
disappointing $2,500. I told him, “If you call ten contacts within your sphere
of influence each day, you’ll get your $100,000 before the year’s end.”
I can count on one hand the number of times he failed to make the ten con-
tacts. He blew by his goal of $100,000 in less than nine months and ended up
earning more than $120,000 that year. In 2001, Rich crossed the $200,000 mark.
All of this was the result of his extraordinary consistency in prospecting.
The never-ending prospecting cycle
You can easily find time to prospect when you have no listings, no pending
transactions, and no buyers to work with. The secret, however, is to continue
to prospect even when you’re busy with all the other activities.
89
Chapter 5: Prospecting Your Way to Listings and Sales

Look at a typical agent’s annual income stream and you’ll see that it goes up
and down like a yo-yo. Most agents have four to, at the most, six good income
months per year. The rest of the time: nada. If you could overlay their rev-
enue streams with their prospecting numbers, you would see that when
prospecting tapers, revenue decreases, leading directly to the business void
that follows.
Your job as a salesperson is to fill a pipeline of leads so you always have new
prospects to work with. And the only way to keep a healthy pipeline or con-
veyer belt of leads is to prospect consistently.
Tracking daily goals and results
Any business in sales can be broken down to a series of repeatable numbers
that, over time, will produce a predetermined result. Once you establish
goals and track your performance over a few months, you’ll be able to 
determine the activities you need to earn the income you desire.
When I was selling real estate, I decided that I needed one appointment per
day in order to reach my income goal. I knew through tracking my numbers
that I needed three leads to create one appointment. What’s more, I knew I
needed to make twelve contacts to generate one high-quality lead, since I
knew that two of three leads would be “tire kickers” — contacts who didn’t
have the desire, need, ability, or authority to either list or buy in the reason-
ably near future.
Based on that knowledge, I determined that I needed to make 36 contacts a
day: 12 for each of the three leads I would need to result in one appointment.
Yes, 36 is a miraculously large number of contacts, but in the long-run, you’ll
find that reaching that number is well worth your time. Use Figure 5-1 to
establish and track your own prospecting numbers.
The law of averages evens out your numbers over time. Don’t evaluate your-
self on a single day’s achievements. Even a week is too short of a period for
evaluation. I’ve had days when I didn’t set a single appointment. Matter of
fact, I probably endured weeks of getting skunked. Over a three-month period,
however, I was always within a 5 percent margin of error on my numbers.

Managing contacts
To store your prospecting information and ensure your prompt and ongoing
follow-up, use contact management software, such as GoldMine, ACT!, or sales-
force.com. Also, look into real estate-specific software packages, such as TOP
PRODUCER or Online Agent, which are designed to help you with your sales
functions and also with business management, including market reports, corre-
spondence templates, and even tracking your closings.
Regardless of the system you select, you must be able to access your contact
database with reliability and ease.
Don’t apply a shoestring budget when managing contacts. Minimally, you’ll
want to invest in a computer (preferably a laptop) and all the software neces-
sary to build and run your business, from contact management to MLS
access, to agency management.

Message in a Bottle: Staying in Touch
A quality contact management system can be a powerful tool. It can trigger
your next call to a prospect. It can keep all your notes in one place for easy
retrieval. It can make interaction with your prospects, sphere of influence,
and past clients simple. Here are some tips on how to use contact manage-
ment software effectively no matter what brand you select:
 Each time you’re ending a prospecting call, determine your prospect’s
time frame and decide when you need to speak again. Schedule the next
contact right then and there.
 When talking to a past client or another prospect within your sphere of
influence, schedule yourself to make the next call, but don’t worry about
asking the prospect. That way, the next time you call, they’ll be pleas-
antly surprised to hear from you.
 In addition to calls, send e-mails to thank contacts for their time and to
reiterate your service offer.
 Obtain permission to add contacts to your monthly e-mail newsletter
mailing.

Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 
Budgeting for success
You should always budget for ongoing self-
improvement. Start with a budget for a ward-
robe that presents you as a successful agent.
Some people will make assumptions of who
you are based on the way that you’re dressed.
For that reason, always dress for success.
Budgeting to attend every business seminar
you can make time for is just as important as
how you’re dressed. Your personal education
and skills-based training is fundamental to your
climb up the ladder of success.
In between, buy books and tapes, download
podcasts, and get your hands, eyes, or ears on
every piece of media that can help you develop
and efficiently use sales skills, mental focus,
leadership, discipline, and motivation to
increase your success.
The most significant asset in your business
right now is you, and ten years from now, the
most significant asset in your business will still
be you. Don’t fail to invest in yourself. I suggest
to most of my clients that they should invest 10
percent of their income in personal develop-
ment. This 10 percent is for advancement of
their skills and their team member’s skills. As a
newer agent, a couple thousand dollars a year
to improve your knowledge, skills, systems, and
techniques is not too much. I can say that I
invested at that level and beyond, and it made
the difference in the speed in which I achieved
top producer status.

 Follow up with first-time contacts by sending them a copy of your
agency brochure or a marketing piece. Or, send a just-listed or 
just-sold card to demonstrate your success as an agent.
 Craft a personalized business letter that is perfectly typed onto your let-
terhead and sent out in a matching envelope.
But wait! Great as all of the above suggestions are for your business, none of
them beat the all-time winning touch of a hand-written thank-you note. This
type of note says to the receiver, “You were so important that I took the time
to pen this in my own hand rather than touching a few buttons on my com-
puter or spitting out a preplanned, standard issue, regurgitated letter that I
have sent to 1,000 other people just like you.
Most people get hundreds of e-mails a day — many of which they don’t even
want. They also receive hundreds of pieces of junk mail a month, mostly from
credit-card and mortgage refinance companies.
The hand-written thank-you note breaks through the clutter. It looks like an
invitation to something special and keeps the relationship active until you talk
again in a few days. It’s still the best way to keep in touch in our technology-
driven world.

Mining Gold from Referrals
In This Chapter
 Discovering the ins and outs of a referral-based business
 Developing a referral strategy that works
 Establishing and maintaining relationships with your referral base
S
alespeople love referrals. They’re the sincerest form of compliment a
client can give, and they’re a remarkably cost-effective route to new 
business.
The idea of attracting referrals is so popular that sales trainers who bill them-
selves as referral gurus make fortunes promoting magical systems that sup-
posedly deliver more referrals than an agent can handle, all in return for
tuition at a three-day seminar. What they talk about for three days is a mys-
tery to me. Referrals are really pretty simple. In this chapter, I tell you all you
need to know. Success comes from perfect practice of the scripts and the
referral-generating and referral-cultivating tactics that you find in the upcom-
ing sections.
Referral Truths and Consequences
Before you turn even a moment of effort away from prospecting activities,
and before you put all your hopes into winning business through a full-tilt
referral-generation program, be aware that in addition to all the benefits that
come with referrals, a 100 percent referral-based business has some down-
sides. Proceed with awareness of these ironclad truths:
 Truth #1: Especially for newer agents, over-reliance on referrals results in
slow-growth simply because early in the agents’ careers they don’t have a
large enough database of existing clients and contacts to draw from.

 Truth #2: Relying entirely on referrals for client development is a
narrow, exclusive, and unbalanced approach. For one thing, if incoming
referrals decline your services, you won’t have other prospecting sys-
tems in place to bail your business out of trouble. What’s more, when
referrals do come in, most will be for buyer prospects rather than seller
prospects. What the referral gurus never reveal is that their approach
develops buyers’ agents — not sellers’ agents (or listing agents), which
are the ones who experience greatest success and build the strongest
long-term real estate sales businesses. (Turn to the section “Becoming a
listing agent” in Chapter 1 for more information about the benefits of
becoming a listing agent.)
Building a Referral-Based Clientele
At its core, a referral is a recommendation. In its best form, a referral is a
high-quality lead and a high-probability prospect that is introduced to you 
by someone both you and the prospect regard highly.
A referral-based business is a business that generates most of its leads as a
result of contacts provided by friends, family, clients, colleagues, and other
associates. Sounds great, doesn’t it? It is great, if — and here’s a big if — you
have a large sphere of influence and enough patience to wait out a lag time of
at least 90 days (and most of the time longer) between when you begin to culti-
vate referrals and when referrals begin to generate revenue for your business.
Building a referral-based clientele is a long-term strategy rather than a quick-
fix tactic. If you’re looking for near-term results (and what newer agent isn’t?)
you’re better off developing clients through a traditional lead-development
program that involves prospecting (see Chapter 5), conversion of expired
and FSBO listings (see Chapter 7), and open houses (see Chapter 8).
Relying exclusively on referrals, especially when you’re a new and undercapi-
talized agent, is a quick form of business suicide that will move you out of the
real estate industry within a year, guaranteed. Instead, consider referrals a
second-stage strategy — one that follows your initial round of business devel-
opment and contributes to the long-term growth and success of your business.
Sources of referrals
Most referrals come from current clients, past clients, people you’ve met
through networking situations, and people you know through social or business
96
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

dealings. The upcoming sections provide information for working with each
group of potential referral contacts.
Current clients
Current clients are people you’re actively representing, in real estate transac-
tions. Current clients are a rich pool of referral opportunity mainly because,
more than any other group, they have real estate on their minds. They’re in
the midst of deals that they’re constantly talking about with their friends,
associates, families, and neighbors. Their conversations revolve around their
real estate wants and needs, their moving plans, and the latest real estate
trends and market activity.
If you don’t ask your current clients to recommend you to their friends or to
refer their friends to you for follow up, you’re really missing out on a huge
opportunity to reach potential prospects. You can bet that your name comes
up in your clients’ conversations, even if it’s just to say they have an appoint-
ment or that they’re awaiting information from you. Putting in a few good
words on your behalf would be a natural and easy thing for them to do. You
just have to ask. You talk to your clients regularly to communicate about the
sale of their home, the process of finding a home, their transaction progress,
or their progress toward closing. During the course of those conversations,
ask for referrals.
Past clients
Past clients are the people you’ve helped through real estate transactions in
the past. They have firsthand knowledge of the quality of service that you
provide. You need to show them that you want to provide the same level of
excellent service to their friends and family by requesting their referrals.
Clients you’ve recently served provide the most fertile opportunity, both
because their experiences are fresh in their minds and because they’re still
buzzing about their recent move to anyone who will listen. Flip to Chapter 15
for more info on how to best follow-up with your clients.
Networking
In sales, networking is a buzzword for building business contacts into referral
alliances.
The objective of networking is to meet success-oriented people with whom
you can exchange referrals, advice, counsel, contacts, and even wisdom.
Ideally, networking results in professional relationships with others who 
are committed not only to their success, but to your success as well.
97
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

The truth is that most salespeople talk about networking more than they
actually do it. They attend a Chamber of Commerce or Rotary Club meeting,
have an enjoyable lunch, visit with a few friends, and chalk the time up to net-
working even though no new alliances were formed, no existing alliances
were deepened, and no referral sources were generated. In other words, no
true networking took place.
To make networking work for you, follow these tips:
 Network with the right mindset. When you network, set your sights on
developing prospect recommendations, not just the names of leads. A
recommendation or phone call to a prospect from someone that you
have a referral relationship with is more valuable than just getting the
name of someone thinking about moving.
Many referral alliances are established with the single objective of gener-
ating leads. Attendees hear of the names of new businesses, new man-
agers, newly arrived residents, or others who are possibilities for your
future contact. A lead from a networking associate is better than no lead
at all, but it’s a long cry from the name of a prospect provided by a refer-
ral alliance who shares extensive background and then offers to put in a
few good words on your behalf.
 Acquire warm referrals. A warm referral begins when a networking
associate makes contact on your behalf with a person who is in the
market for your services. Warm referrals involve calls or correspon-
dence that convey your qualifications, the quality of your service, and
reasons why prospects should at least interview you for the opportunity
to represent their interests in real estate transactions.
When establishing networking relationships or referral alliances, work 
to gain a mutual agreement that those in the network will engage in the
practice of exchanging warm leads.
Business and social contacts
Many people you meet socially or through business dealings never become
clients. They may have previously established agent relationships or they
may not be in the market for a real estate transaction. Nonetheless, they’re
important to your business because they’re in a position to give and receive
referrals.
Notice the words “give and receive” in the previous sentence. The law of reci-
procity is alive and well in 21st century business circles. It’s the old tenet of
“I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine.”
98
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

In his book, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People (Free Press), Stephen
Covey talks about emotional bank accounts into which successful people
must make deposits before making withdrawals. Apply that wisdom as you
build your referral network. Start by sharing business referrals, counsel, help,
and wisdom with others, and before long the recipients of your kindness will
repay you with similar efforts. By helping your friends, family, and associates
build their own businesses, you’ll, in time, gain their help in building yours.
When dealing with your referral sources, your goal should be to provide more
service and value than is expected. Also be sure to keep your accounts with
others in the black, rather than in the red.
Constructing a referral database
One of the best ways to start generating referrals is to construct a referral
database that includes all the people (and their friends) likely to help you by
referring your services.
If you’re like most agents, your first list of business and social contacts will
be embarrassingly short. That’s because few people dig deep enough to think
of all the people with whom they have business and social ties.
To jog your memory, use the worksheet in Figure 6-1. Then list the names of
people in each category who know and respect you and may be willing to
refer prospects your way.
Three golden rules for cultivating referrals
To win referrals, you have to follow three important rules, and in this arena,
close isn’t good enough. Follow just two of the three rules and growth of your
referral-based business will be stunted. Follow all three, and you’ll open the
floodgates to success.
1. Be referable
Unless you’re referable, it’s next to impossible to generate large numbers of
quality referrals. And being a pleasant person isn’t enough. To attract refer-
rals, follow these tips:
 Do what you say you’ll do and do it with excellence. People known 
for mediocre results never win the kind of accolades that lead to 
recommendations.

Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Know your client’s expectations. The only way you can know what your
clients expect from you is to ask. The typical agent thinks a client simply
wants to get a home sold or find a home to buy, when in fact that end
result tells you nothing about the client’s service expectations. Ask 
your clients these questions:
• What do you expect from the agent you choose to work with?
• What are the top three services I could provide that would add
value when working with you?
• If you’ve worked with other agents in the past, what did you like
best and least about the experience?
 Deliver exemplary service that exceeds expectations. Meet and exceed
your client’s service expectations and they’ll become ATM machines for
referrals. Follow these steps to secure clients for life:
• Survey your clients on a regular basis to find out whether their
needs are being met and how you can serve them better.
• Become a recognized real estate expert and share your expertise
by calling clients regularly with reports on market trends, equity
growth, and investment opportunities.
• Continue serving your clients after the sale closes.
• Get to know your clients beyond their real estate needs.
For more advice, flip to Chapter 15, which is full of tips for using service
and follow-through to win clients, and their praise, for life.
 Say thank you. This step is so simple, but in our what’s-in-it-for-me
world most service providers overlook the power it possesses. When
was the last time your attorney, accountant, or banker thanked you for
your business? When was the last time the person who pumps your gas,
handles your dry cleaning, or bags your groceries thanked you for con-
tinuously directing your service dollars into their paychecks?
Extend your thanks verbally and put it into hand-written notes. Find
simple and creative ways to express your appreciation to the people
that put food on your table, gas in your car, dollars in your retirement
account, and tuition dollars into your children’s college education
accounts. Your thanks will be rewarded with referrals.
 Admit and correct mistakes. If your service falls short, admit it, apolo-
gize, and quickly make amends.
101
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

Sometimes, your most loyal clients — and strongest referral alliances —
result from perfectly corrected mistakes. When things go awry, too many
people put more effort into covering their tracks than righting the wrong
and helping the client. Instead of wasting your energy trying to hide mis-
takes, follow these steps:
• Find out what the problem is and solve it quickly.
• Once the problem has been identified, admit it was your fault.
Diffuse frustration or anger by saying, “You’re right; I blew it, 
and I’m sorry.”
• Tell him how you’ll make amends. Once he knows that you’re com-
mitted to his satisfaction, the healing of the relationship can begin.
• Follow up to find out whether the problem was resolved to the
client’s satisfaction and whether there is anything else you can 
do for him.
2. Mine your contacts
The first step toward mining — or extracting value from — your referral con-
tacts is to segment your database into manageable subgroups.
To mine your resources effectively you have to put most of your effort
toward contacts with the highest referral potential. Contrary to popular opin-
ion, you can’t afford to treat all referral sources with equal attention. Unless
you establish priorities, you won’t have the time or energy to devote to those
sources who will benefit your business the most.
 Start by creating a top-level, or platinum, group of contacts. This cate-
gory includes clients that were a delight to work with, people that are in
key strategic positions, and friends and associates who are strongly
likely to refer business your way. Go through your complete database
looking for those contacts with the following traits:
• People who understand your need for business referrals.
• People who really like you and want to help you.
• People who did business with you in the past and were highly sat-
isfied by your service.
• People who have previously sent referrals to you, even if the refer-
rals never resulted in a commission check.
The platinum group is your best group of referring partners or referral
alliances, and you must treat them accordingly. They deserve personal
attention and personal interaction from you on a regular schedule. You
102
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

may want to contact this group by phone on a monthly or bimonthly
basis. The secret is personal contact by phone or in person.
You may even create a Top 20 or Top50 list within this group. This super-
elite list merits your highest level of attention. Send them special and
personal correspondence a couple times a year, and see them personally
on a face-to-face basis a few times a year as well. Invite them to special
client-appreciation events — or invite them in very small groups to
attend functions or special activities with you — to further crank up the
referral machine.
 Create a second-tier gold level of contacts that you want to cultivate
into platinum affiliates.
This group will include influential people that are likely to refer but only
if you meet a few conditions. You may need to ask them for referrals con-
sistently over a period of time before they come through. Or you may
need to achieve greater familiarity or top-of-mind consciousness before
they’re comfortable with the idea of sending business your way.
To develop this group, take time to establish your credentials and com-
petitive position (the information in Chapter 14 will help). By proving
that you save clients more money, sell quicker, and handle smoother 
and better transactions, you’ll, in time, develop advocates that send you
referrals for years to come. You may want to contact this group once a
quarter by phone or in person.
If you give contacts in this group a stack of your business cards to hand
out like candy, you’re wasting your time. See the sidebar titled “How to
trash your business card, fast.”
 Create a silver level of contacts for future cultivation.
This group will include contacts that may refer someday, but the jury is
still out regarding when and if. Still, because you know them and they
know you, they deserve your attention and follow-up.
The people in this group are in a position to refer business, but they may
not be overly excited about you or, in some cases, any service provider.
Include in this group people that you’ve only recently met, introverts,
people with limited social circles, and people who are tremendously ana-
lytical or demanding and whose need for proof and perfection may put
the brake on their willingness to share referrals with others. Phone
these silver level clients at least once or twice a year to maintain the
personal contact with them.
I believe that the key to driving referrals out of these groups is personal
touch or interaction. Your ability to engage yourself in prospects’ personal
103
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

lives and to provide them with more than just the usual monthly newsletter
will set you apart from the other agents in your area.
Anyone that doesn’t fit into the platinum, gold, or silver category has limited
referral value to your business. Some trainers suggest purging iffy contacts
out of your database, but I don’t share that view. After all, how difficult is it to
include the extra names when you distribute your e-mail newsletter monthly,
at absolutely no extra cost? Once the data is collected and contact permission
is obtained, the hard work is over. All you have to do is click “send” on a regu-
lar basis, and then stuff and send an occasional snail mail communication.
Consider creating a bronze category just to keep remote possibilities in your
contact circle. Especially when your overall database is small, you want to
wring potential out of every hope. Inexpensive, regular contacts are a step in
the right direction toward engaging the interest of these contacts and con-
verting them into future referral sources.
104
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 
How to trash your business card, fast
To rev up referrals, stop handing out your busi-
ness cards.
Before you write me off as crazy, let me clarify:
Don’t completely stop using your business
cards. Continue using them to share your con-
tact information following personal encounters.
However, the trick is to completely stop asking
others to hand them out on your behalf to those
who may only be iffy prospects (at best) for your
business. Understand this truth: Putting a busi-
ness card into someone else’s hands with the
hope it’ll get passed along is not the route to a
new business relationship. It’s only the begin-
ning of a quick trip to the trash can.
Many salespeople were taught to hand five
business cards to clients with the request that
they pass them out to friends that wanted 
to buy or sell real estate. Tracking studies 
have delivered the verdict on this approach: It
doesn’t work. Even if (a big if) your client is suc-
cessful at passing your cards out to others, the
recipients will rarely call you, and sales never
follow. This low return (and high trash rate)
makes this practice worthless.
Instead of papering the world with business
cards in a futile effort to get your contact infor-
mation into the hands of prospects considering
moves, turn your thinking upside down. Quit
worrying about distributing contact information
and start worrying about collecting it.
When working with referral sources, make it
your objective to secure names, addresses,
phone numbers, cell phone numbers, work num-
bers, and e-mail addresses for those in the
market to sell or buy. From there, you can reach
out to pursue the leads. Instead of asking your
referral sources to distribute a card, ask them to
make a personal contact on your behalf. They
can meet with or call the prospect in advance of
your call and share your name and a little about
the success you helped them achieve.

3. Leverage your relationships
In your everyday dealings, you come into frequent contact with people who
you can easily lead up your relationship ladder and cultivate into referral
sources.
For some agents, these daily encounters revolve around the lives of their 
children — through meetings with teachers, participation in school events,
visits with other parents, sideline conversations at soccer and T-ball prac-
tices, and on and on. If you don’t have children, don’t forget all the people you
meet in church groups, golf or athletic clubs, neighborhood associations, and
other social outlets. Cast your net carefully, and you’ll bring many of these
people into your referral circle.
These social sources don’t develop into referrals automatically. It’s your
obligation to let people know what you do, why you’re the best, and how you
deliver successful outcomes. Flip to Chapter 14 if you need help defining and
presenting your competitive strategy.
As you begin leveraging personal relationships, start by setting a high expec-
tation for the quality of communication and service you’ll deliver. At the
same time, set moderate to low expectations for quick referral results.
Cultivating acquaintances into referral alliances takes time, patience, 
and persistence.
Developing Your Referral Strategy
To develop referrals, you need to start with a referral mindset. You’ll know
you have an effective referral mindset when the following occur:
 Every prospecting, marketing, and customer service action is accompa-
nied by the realization that the contact could lead not only to new busi-
ness, but also to positive word-of-mouth and to the recommendation of
your service to others.
 You create, believe in, and implement strategies that purposefully gener-
ate referrals as a regular part of your business development activities.
 You know that prospecting is the best route to referral success. You
understand that in the same way (and often at the same time) that you
prospect for client leads you also need to prospect for referrals. Chapter
5 is jam-packed with advice on how to do just that.
105
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

Generating referrals is among the easiest, most cost-effective ways to gain
new business leads, but success doesn’t happen overnight. Even your 
platinum-level referral sources need to be constantly contacted and reminded
to send business your direction. The upcoming sections help you set your
objectives and develop a system that first delivers the kind of service that
wins recommendations and then transfers that value, through ongoing com-
munication, into new business opportunities.
Helping people send you the 
type of referrals you seek
Before you launch a referral-generating effort, you need to know what you’re
looking for. After you know what you’re looking for, you then have to let
others know as well. In a sentence, you need to be able to tell your referral
sources exactly what your ideal real estate prospect looks like. Include the
following information:
 Moments when people become great prospects. Help your referral
sources notice the signs that indicate that their friends are in the “think-
ing about moving” stage, because your goal is to enter the game before
the transaction is already underway. Universal signs to watch for include
pregnancy, recent adoption, promotion, transfer, trouble with aging par-
ents, a recent empty nest, or trouble in a marriage or relationship.
Left to their own good intentions, many people will call to tip you off
about people they’ve just heard are in the process of buying or selling.
By the time that a mutual friend hears that someone is actively looking
to buy or is in the midst of selling, it’s too late. By then, the prospects
probably already have an agent relationship.
 Your interest in helping people sell their homes. The standard con-
sumer view of real estate agents is that they put people into their cars,
drive them around, and sell them houses. If you don’t expand this initial
impression, most of your referrals will be for people seeking to buy
rather than sell homes. Buyers are great clients and important sources
of revenue, but the best agents build their businesses through listings.
By cultivating referrals for those clients thinking about selling their
homes, you’ll put your business on a faster track to growth.
 Your real estate niche. If you’re particularly effective at serving a spe-
cific niche of real estate clients, such as investors, seniors, younger-
generation buyers, or first-time buyers, let your referral sources know.
Likewise, if you want to gain more of a certain kind of buyer or seller,
106
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

you need to inform your sources about your expertise in the desired
segment and what prospects in that category look like.
When communicating your market niche interests, start by sharing your
overall competitive market advantage and inviting all referrals. Then
explain the particular niche market expertise that you’ve developed and
they’ll think of you when they hear that their contacts have interest in
your specialty area.
The point of all this guidance isn’t to get your referral sources to screen leads
for you. Instead, the goal is to educate your sources. Make sure they know
that you still want them to recommend the names of anyone who has interest
in buying or selling property. In this case, less is not more.
Setting your goal
In an especially effective referral-development program, you may aim to
achieve two referrals a year, on average, from each of your platinum-level
sources, one a year from those in your gold group, and one every other year
from those in the silver category. Referrals from sources at the bronze-level
are too hard to project, but for all other categories, you need to give yourself
an annual goal to aim for. (For more on these levels, refer to the section,
“Three golden rules for cultivating referrals,” earlier in this chapter.) In the
beginning, you may just pluck your goal from thin air. However, after you
establish your first year expectations (or hopes), you’ll have a good bench-
mark against which to measure progress and set your future goals.
As you set goals and track progress, consider these tips:
 The number of referrals you aim to generate from platinum-level sources
should be double what you expect from gold-level sources, and your
expectations from gold-level sources should be double what you expect
from silver-level sources.
 Whenever you receive a referral, note whether the source is listed in
your platinum, gold, silver, or bronze categories. This will help you track
whether those in each category are performing at the projected levels. If
they’re not, you’ll know to enhance communications and general referral
efforts accordingly.
 As you qualify and work with referrals, note which of your database
groups — platinum, gold, silver, and bronze — are delivering referrals
that lead to business. If you notice that some categories are generating
referrals that are dramatically more or less qualified than other cate-
gories, study your own communications to see how your messages to
those various groups may be contributing to strong or weak leads.

Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

Approaching your referral sources
Marketing for referrals with mailers, calendars, recipe cards, and other out-
reach and appreciation efforts is nowhere near as effective as prospecting for
referrals by making personal calls and requests.
The hard truth is that most consumers stand a far better chance of finding a
poor agent than a great one. Once you personally convince your sources that
you’re among the best in the field, referrals will definitely follow.
When cultivating referral sources, realize that most people who send refer-
rals your way do so for a variety of reasons. Above all, they recommend you
for the following two reasons:
 To create friendship and trust. People like to help those they like and
believe in. Take time to get to know the contacts in the platinum and
gold levels of your database, and let them get to know you. Share the
vision you hold for your business. Let them catch your enthusiasm and
buy into your dream. As a result, they will have a vested interest in your
success and will be excited to help you achieve your goal.
 To be champions. Every time you deliver superb service and an excel-
lent outcome you create clients who are willing to champion your busi-
ness. What’s more, based on your exemplary performance, you create
clients who know firsthand that by recommending you to others they’ll
become champions in the minds of their friends and family members.
It’s never too early in the agent-client relationship to begin building referral
relationships. You can start during the first meeting or phone call with any
prospect by using a script similar to the following:
“Fred, I build my business primarily based on referrals from clients. The bene-
fit to you is my focus will always be to give you the best service possible. The
reason is I want to earn the honor to talk with you in the future about who you
know that would benefit from my service. The only way I deserve to have that
conversation is based on the job I do for you. I know that if you are delighted
with my service, you will want to help me and your friends out.”
When approaching referral sources, keep a few important rules in mind.
Rule 1: Respect the referral process
When you ask for referrals, you enter the hallowed territory of another
person’s treasured relationships. In ancient times, people would go through
108
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

extensive purification ceremonies before even stepping onto holy ground.
Asking for referrals is just about that special.
Don’t ask for referrals by simply adding a throwaway line onto the end of
another conversation. For example, don’t say, “Oh, by the way” before you
ask for a business referral. That tactic minimizes the importance of the refer-
ral, instead of raising it to the high level of honor and respect it deserves.
A quality referral request should be take least five minutes. Ten minutes may
be even more effective.
My friend Bill Cates, a referral coach and author of the book, Ultimate
Referrals (Thunder Hill Press), advises that you precede your referral 
request with the statement, “I have an important question to ask you.” This
statement forces a pause, builds anticipation, and sets the tone for a mean-
ingful conversation.
Rule 2: Ask for help
If you’re soliciting referrals, you are, in fact, asking for help. So say so. The
trouble here is that many agents’ egos get in the way. These inflated egos
won’t let the words out of most agents’ mouths. “I need your help” or “I 
value your help” are powerful keys for opening the referral floodgate.
Rule 3: Ask permission
In particular, ask permission to explore your client’s contact database — 
not by rifling through computer files but by hearing of and gaining access 
to associates you may be able to serve. When asking for permission, use a
script like this one:
“I’m delighted that I’ve been able to serve you. I was wondering about others
you might know in your life that would also benefit from my service. Could
we explore for a few moments who else we might be able to serve?”
The final question in the script is an important one. Too many agents ask for
referrals and then leave the burden of thinking up names on the shoulders of
their clients. The truth is that your referral sources don’t want to work that
hard. They’ll work that hard with you, but they won’t do it alone.
Rule 4: Get specific
Don’t just make a general request for referrals and leave it at that. Saying, 
“Do you know anyone you may like to refer to my business” is sort of like a
department store clerk who asks, “May I help you?” The automatic response,
at least 90 percent of the time, is “No, just looking.”
109
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

Sharpen the focus of your request by leading clients into areas or niches in their
lives where they have day-to-day relationships. Ask clients about potential refer-
rals among the families at their church or workplace, people they know through
their children’s soccer team, or prospects they’ve met through school affilia-
tions. If you know they’re members of certain associations or groups, pull out
the member roster and spend a few minutes talking about the names on the list.
Asking the right questions 
at the right time
Once they’ve asked for and received a referral, most salespeople stop and
wait for the magic to happen. However, this moment is when Phase 2 of the
referral-generation process kicks in.
After a referral comes through, you want to thank your referral source imme-
diately. After that, you need to determine the nature of the referral in order to
determine the level of lead you’ll be dealing with. To find out, ask the referral
source the following:
 How do you know this person?
 How would you describe your relationship?
 What type of a personality will I encounter with this person?
 What are a few of this person’s personal interests?
 What organizations does this person belong to?
 Do you see anything that we have in common?
Getting more than the prospect’s name and number by asking questions and
going the extra mile allows you to move the referral lead up to a higher prob-
ability of conversion.
Once you’ve found these answers, you can slot the referral into one of the
four referral tiers:
 C Level: Referrals in this category are cold. Your referral source has pro-
vided you with the name and phone number of a potential prospect, but
the source asks that you not use his or her name to create an opening.
 B Level: This referral is lukewarm. You have the prospect’s name and
phone number and permission to use the name of your referral source
to open the door. Unfortunately, from now on, you’re on your own.
110
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 A Level: This is a warm referral. You have the prospect’s name and
number. You have permission to use the name of your referral source as
a door opener. To top things off, your source gave you time to ask ques-
tions about the lead. This extra bit of time can improve your odds of
connection with the prospect on the first call.
 AA Level: This referral is the whale in the referral fishing game. With a
AA-level referral, you have all the resources that you have at the A level,
plus you also have the insider’s edge because your referral source agrees
to contact the prospect in advance of your call to introduce you. This
advance contact paves the way for a welcomed first call. It also can lead
to a lunch or face-to-face meeting where you, your referral source, and
your new lead get together to transfer the relationship into your hands.
When you have the answers you need, thank your referral source again and
offer your assurance that you’ll provide the same level of quality service that
he or she has received from you in the past. And don’t forget to follow up
with a handwritten thank-you note!
Handling the referrals you receive
Not all referrals turn into transactions. In fact, not all referrals possess the
desire, need, authority, and ability necessary to qualify as likely prospects for
your business. That doesn’t mean that every referral isn’t important to your
business; it just means that not every referral demands the same follow-up
approach.
When handling referrals, take these steps:
1. Qualify the lead and determine the odds that your investment of time
and resources will result in a commission check.
Turn to the sections titled “Why and how to qualify prospects” and
“Checking your prospect’s DNA” in Chapter 9 for help.
2. Develop only qualified referrals into client prospects.
When working with referrals, agents often feel compelled to work with
every lead, regardless of the person’s qualifications or willingness to
commit to an exclusive agency relationship. I believe this is an error. Ask
yourself: If this person came from an ad call, sign call, open house, or
any other lead generation system, would I pursue the business given the
person’s qualifications and commitment? Don’t change your standards,
expectations, or code of conduct simply because the lead was referred
to you.
111
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

3. Thank and reward your referral sources for every single lead they
provide.
Too many agents reward referral sources only when the leads they pro-
vide produce a return in the form of a commission check. This is a huge
mistake. If you train friends and associates to think that you only value
referrals that result in closed deals, you run the risk of them prescreen-
ing leads and passing along only the ones they think will result in sales.
Reward and acknowledge each and every referral you receive.
4. Keep your referral sources informed of the lead’s progress.
Especially if you’re faced with the need to drop a prospect, let your
referral source know what’s happening. Explain that although this time
the match didn’t work out, you sincerely appreciate the recommenda-
tion and are honored by the referral. Try to avoid the gory details as you
walk the tightrope, sparing yourself wasted time while preserving the
strength of your established referral relationship.
Developing Referral Relationships
After you’ve received a referral, gathered information, and ranked the lead,
it’s time to pick up the phone. The advice and scripts in the upcoming sec-
tions help you at each step of the lead-conversion process.
Making first-time contact
The first call is the hardest one to make. Until you make first contact, you
really don’t know the quality of the lead. It could turn out to be a huge busi-
ness opportunity — or nothing at all. You have to hope for the best because
the referral lead could result in years of business and in an important new
referral alliance. However, it could all go into the trash 60 seconds after you
make the call. As you initiate contact with a new referral, heed the upcoming
advice.
Know the two objectives of your first call or visit
The primary objective of your first contact, like the objective of any other first
sales call to a new prospect, is to book an appointment. The first appointment
may take the form of an exploratory session aimed at determining the wants,
needs, and desires of the lead, or it may be an appointment to conduct a
buyer consultation or listing presentation.
112
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

The secondary objective of your first contact is to open the door to establish-
ing trust and respect, demonstrating your knowledge, and staking your posi-
tion as a reliable resource.
In your first contact, you’re not trying to make a sale; you’re just trying to
achieve a face-to-face meeting.
Use the name of your referral source to open doors
The best way to break through your prospect’s defenses is to share the name
of your referral source. By presenting the name of your mutual associate, you
establish immediate rapport and credibility. In your opening statement,
include a reference to your referral source by using a script such as this:
“Hello, Mr. Smith, this is Dirk Zeller with Real Estate Champions. The reason
for my call is that your name came up in a conversation yesterday with Bob
Jones with the Acme Delivery Company.”
Then continue by using a linking statement, such as:
“He said you’re neighbors,” or “He said you use to work together,” or “He
said your sons play soccer on the same team.”
“Well, Bob Jones is a very valuable client. Bob knows I primarily work with
referrals; he suggested I give you a call. He thought it would be worth a few
minutes of our mutual time to see if we should meet.”
You can also use the following variation:
“Bob was pleased with the service I provided to him and his family. He
thought you’d like to evaluate how I might be able to assist you in the
future.”
Converting referrals into clients 
or referral sources
Once you’ve established a solid opening connection, it’s time to ask probing
questions that help you determine the wants, needs, desires, and expecta-
tions of the lead. Depending on your findings, the lead may result in a quali-
fied prospect that you convert into a client. Or you may determine that while
the lead isn’t ready to buy or sell or to commit to an exclusive agent relation-
ship, the person is a valuable resource to be added to your referral database.
113
Chapter 6: Mining Gold from Referrals

Use the techniques shared in Chapter 5 to assess the lead’s business poten-
tial and to gather the information you need.
Personal visits and calls
Leads generated through referrals come with a higher client-conversion prob-
ability than leads received from ad calls, sign calls, or any other cold sources.
Due to that fact, consider investing some additional time as you launch the
relationship. Instead of, or in addition to, a personal call, consider stopping
by to personally meet your new leads in their home. Once they attach a face
and voice to your name, they’ll find it more difficult to reject you or select
someone else to represent their interests.
If a personal visit isn’t possible, aim to enhance the sense of personal connec-
tion through an increased number and frequency of calls. It takes, on aver-
age, four to six calls for you to leave a lasting impression.
Written notes, e-mail messages, and mailers
Between calls and personal visits, build a bridge with personal notes and
e-mail messages. Written communications will never replace the personal
touch of phone calls or face-to-face visits, but in between live contact they 
do a great job of keeping the connection alive.
Send market updates, testimonials, letters from other satisfied clients, infor-
mation on your current listed properties, and news about key awards or
recognition you’ve received.
Treat leads as if they’re already your clients by adding them to your newslet-
ter list and to insider mailings lists that share news from your office.

Winning Business from Expired
and FSBO Listings
In This Chapter
 Converting expired listings into new listings for your business
 Securing for-sale-by-owner, or FSBO, listings
 Staying targeted, competitive, and resilient
I
f you’ve been in the real estate business for any time at all, you’ve proba-
bly already sensed that many agents have a preconceived negative impres-
sion of expired listings and for-sale-by-owner listings, or FSBOs. These agents
act as if these listings represent second-hand goods that aren’t worthy of
their interests and abilities. These same agents may also look down on fellow
agents who work expired or FSBO listings. As a result, they turn their backs
on tremendous revenue potential and literally thousands of annual listings.
And that’s great news for agents like you who can reap great success by con-
verting expired and FSBO listings to new listings for your business.
I honestly believe that agents who work, or have worked, expired and FSBO
listings with successful outcomes are the best salespeople in the real estate
industry. They prove they’re skillful in sales, time management, prospecting,
lead follow-up, presentations, objection handling, and closing. They know how
to put their sales skills to work to book appointments, make presentations, and
persuade potential customers to become clients. As a result, they make more
money and have more listings than agents who don’t work these two areas.
Even though both expired listings and FSBOs are great sources for generating
listings, these must not be the only revenue streams you spend your time
generating. You must have at least three areas from which you create leads,
revenue, and listing opportunities. Expired listings and FSBOs can be time-
consuming if done correctly, but they’re certainly worth it. You have to find a
mix that works well with the amount of time, effort, and energy you plan to

spend working these and other areas of business generation. The truth is that
you can’t attack ten different lead generation models as once. You have to
select the best handful to use to generate your listing business.
If you like the idea of being a successful agent who works these areas, read
on. This chapter reveals why and when to pursue expired and FSBO listings
and how to convert others’ past real estate sales failures into your own suc-
cess stories.
Three Reasons to Work Expired 
and FSBO Listings
Any new agent with aspirations to climb all the way to the top tier of success
in residential real estate should consider working expired and FSBO listings
for three good reasons:
 They’re easy to find. You don’t even have to ask the owners if they’re
considering selling. All you have to do is notice the For Sale By Owner
ads or signs or scan the MLS files for property listings that expired with-
out buyer offers. It’s hardly rocket science.
 They exist in any kind of market condition. You read that correctly. If
you’re skilled at converting expired and FSBO listings, market conditions
will have little bearing on your income and overall success. Here’s why:
In a market that is experiencing sluggish sales, buyers are in control and
listings move slowly, if at all. As a result, a large number of listings expire
each day, week, month, and year, providing you with a near-endless
supply of conversion opportunities. On the flip side, when the market-
place is robust and listings are moving briskly, sellers enjoy quick sales,
high list-to-sold ratios, and multiple offers. In this environment, an abun-
dance of FSBOs sprout up. Consumers, due to what they see and read in
the media, think selling a home is easy. So, they devalue the services of
real estate agents and try to sell on their own.
Agents who work expired and FSBO listings can make their businesses 
bulletproof by simply shifting their listing emphasis to fit market trends —
focusing on expired listings in sluggish markets and on FSBOs in brisk 
markets.
 Working expired listings and FSBOs provides the best training an
agent can get. No question about it, if you’re going to convert four, five,
or even six expired or FSBO listings a month, you’re going to become a
116
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

great salesperson. I’m not going to whitewash the truth: You’ll work hard
getting there. But, the rewards — in terms of self-discipline, time man-
agement, sales skills, personal confidence, and, last but certainly not
least, a whole lot of money — make the effort well worth the investment.
Turning Bad Listings to Good Business:
The ABCs of Expired Listings
When an owner and agent agree to work together to sell a property, they sign
a listing agreement that is valid for a specific length of time. Unless the home
sells and closes within the specified time period, or unless the owner and
agent agree in writing to extend the time period, the listing expires.
Many agents don’t even try to win listing extensions because they’re embar-
rassed to ask for them. They didn’t get the home sold during the term of the
listing, so they assume the owner will not grant them additional time to sell
the property. To avoid the owner’s rejection, they avoid the conversation
altogether. Their reluctance leads to the opportunity for the assertive agent
to move in and convert the expired listing to a new piece of business.
Securing an expired listing is a pretty simple process that many agents make
more complicated than necessary.
Basically, to win an expired listing, all you have to do is make a phone call or
series of phone calls. Yet agents create complex and elaborate systems
involving extensive postcard mailings followed by sales letters and direct
mail packages. They jam the owner’s mailbox with cute, clever, and even
corny packages, postcards, and letters. They create envelopes that look like
they contain express deliveries. I’ve even seen agent-created mailers shaped
to resemble firecrackers which, when opened, reveal the message, “Bang!
Your listing is dead.” And you wonder why people call it junk mail.
The agents who actually take the time to work expired listings and rely exclu-
sively on direct mail win a distant second place behind those who call directly
or use a call and mail combination. An owner with a ready-to-expire listing is
flooded with direct mailers, all competing to be the one that grabs the owner’s
attention and interest. However, what grabs attention is personal contact.
Finding expired listings
If you’re a listing agent, the two biggest questions you face are: “Who do I
call?” and “Where do I get seller information?” If you’re working to convert
expired listings, the answers are right here at your fingertips.
117
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

Follow these suggestions:
 Read the daily MLS hot sheet, where each day most MLS systems post
newly expired listings under the category, “expired listings.”
 Search the MLS file by entering “expired” as your search parameter.
 See if your market’s MLS system is among the few that allow agents to
identify in advance the date listings are set to expire. Most MLS systems
block an agent’s ability to see when another agent’s listing will expire;
however, some don’t. If your MLS provides the expiration date, you can
print information on properties that are due to expire within the next
few days and be prepared to move when the time arrives. Don’t jump the
gun, though — make sure you let listings expire before declaring them
dead.
I admit that I’m not a fan of agents being able to see in advance when a listing
will expire. Access to too much information is bad for a couple reasons:
 Knowing the expiration date can be detrimental to sellers: When
agents know that a listing is about to expire, showings diminish. For one
thing, agents consider the property “picked over.” Also, they sometimes
hold off showing it to prospective buyer clients, hoping that by waiting
they can win the listing and therefore represent both the seller and the
buyer.
 Knowing the expiration date can be tempting to some agents:
Contacting a seller in advance of a listing expiration is a clear violation
of the code of ethics for real estate agents, but unfortunately that doesn’t
stop some agents who wander into the gray area when they’re desperate
for a listing. The vast majority of MLS systems block agents from viewing
the expired listing before its time, but when the date is revealed a few
agents use the information and lower the standard of ethics for the
whole industry.
Treating expired listings as 
high-probability leads
With the seller’s information in hand, you’re ready to proceed with what I call
a high-probability lead. Leads come from many sources: Internet inquiries, ad
calls, sign calls, and cold calls. Some deliver possible leads; others deliver
probable leads. The difference lies in the likelihood that the leads will con-
vert to business. For example:
118
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Possible leads convert less than half the time
 Probable leads convert far more often.
Working probable leads is much more efficient for a real estate agent, and it’s
difficult to find a more probable lead than the owner of a home with an expired
listing. The owner has demonstrated the desire or need to sell and shows the
existence of a problem you can help solve. The problem, of course, is that after
waiting out the entire listing period, the owner’s home didn’t sell. However, the
problem, in most owners’ eyes, is that the previous agent didn’t perform well.
In more than 90 percent of the cases, though, the real reason the home didn’t
sell is because it was overpriced. More than half of the time, these homes go
right back on the market with a different agent — why not you?
Engaging an expired listing
Working expired listings is an all-or-nothing game. However, this shouldn’t be
the only area you generate leads from. Instead, make expired listings just one
of your pillars of business. Also, you can’t proceed in a half-hearted, here-
today-gone-tomorrow fashion. Either you work expired listings — every day
and on a consistent basis — or you don’t. You can’t try to work expired list-
ings for a few days when you find yourself low on listings, and then quit for a
few weeks only to return to the effort again later. You won’t find a business
card stating that an agent is a kind-of-expired agent. If you want to capitalize
by converting expired listings, be ready to make working expired listings
your way of business life.
As a new agent, my work life revolved around expired listings. I realized that
in any given month a majority of listing expirations occurred over the course
of a few days, and that is still the case today. Up to one third of all the listings
that expire occur over the last few days of the month and the first day of the
new month. If you’re going to work expired listings, get ready to make those
days very long work days.
I followed this routine:
 I’d arrive at the office around 6:00 a.m. and immediately print out the
expired listings. Some days I’d end up with more than a hundred listings
on my desk.
 At 6:30 a.m. one of my staff members, who usually arrived at 7:30
a.m., came in to start researching phone numbers that weren’t listed
on the MLS printout. We searched four different sources for missing
numbers: We first searched the Coles directory. Then we would move on
119
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

to the MLS Metro-scan search. If we still didn’t have the phone number, we
would search the Internet through the Yahoo! people search. Finally we
would package the rest up for the title company to search the tax records.
We asked that the title company have those back to us before 9 a.m.
At times, I have also called the previous agent to ask for the seller’s
phone number. I’d offer them some of the commission if they were will-
ing to give it to me. The reason I did this is because if I get the number,
and few other agents in the market have it, I have a higher probability of
securing the listing.
 Based on gut instinct, market knowledge, and the information con-
tained in the MLS printout, I’d sort the properties by quickly deter-
mining why each didn’t sell and putting the ones that offered the
highest probability of listing conversion and sale on top. Also, I’d
move to the top of the list promising properties located in areas 
where I really wanted listings.
 I would then practice my scripts and dialogues, taking time to antici-
pate the objections I may hear from the seller and practicing how I’d
overcome the barrier. I knew before placing a phone call to the owner
that my objective was to move beyond any objections and to secure an
appointment.
 After 30 minutes of practice, by 7:45 a.m., I was on the phone, aiming
to reach people before they went to work and before other agents
began making contact later in the morning.
Today, your schedule is dictated by limitations stipulated by state and
national No Call Laws. For information, see the upcoming sidebar titled,
“Keep it legal! Following the rules of the No Call Law.” If you can’t secure
the phone number because of the No Call Laws, or you simply can’t find
the number, go to the door directly using the scripts, dialogues, and sur-
veys in this chapter. You’ll see fewer people, but you’ll be more effective
because you’re face to face (and many people prefer talking face to face).
 My goal was to be the first to get through to the owner of every
expired listing, but obviously that isn’t always possible, especially on
a day when the pile of listing printouts reaches a hundred or more.
Once I got through, scheduled an appointment, and established a good
connection and sense of trust, I’d warn the owners about the number of
calls they’d receive over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours. I’d sug-
gest that to avoid interruptions they unplug their phone for the day. I
knew that if the owner could dodge the calls over the first day or two 
following the listing expiration, most agents would quit trying to get
through. See the upcoming section “Calling the seller: What to say and
how to say it” for more info about contacting owners of expired listings.
120
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

The key to success with expired listings is to work them consistently and with
commitment. Most agents who claim to work expired listings do so only at the
end of the month and, even then, only sporadically. I never took a vacation at
the end of the month, because I didn’t want to miss the flood of expired listings
121
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings
Keep it legal! Following the rules 
of the No Call Law
Many agents cheered when the No Call Law
took effect. With the stroke of a political pen,
they were handed an excuse for not picking up
the phone. When real estate company execu-
tives asked me what the law would mean to our
industry, I answered truthfully: The effect will
be negligible; 97 percent of all agents don’t
prospect anyway, so the new call restrictions
affect only a miniscule segment of agents. The
consumers are delighted with the No Call Law,
but most salespeople are even happier with the
built-in excuse.
Today, with over 100 million people on the No
Call list, it’s here to stay. The only salespeople
who aren’t affected are charities, fund raising
organizations, consumer surveying groups, and
politicians. Imagine that! Politicians created a
loophole for themselves.
Within the law, you can still prospect. You just
have to follow the rules:
 You can turn your call into a survey. You
can collect information on home buying
trends, real estate services, consumer
expectations of real estate agents, or a mil-
lion other aspects of the industry.
 You can gain advance permission, prefer-
ably in writing, to place calls. For example,
at the bottom of your open house sign-in
sheet, buyer interview data form, or e-mail
newsletter subscriber form, include a per-
mission statement. By signing, prospects
grant you permission to call them with
updates on market activity and their equity
position. With this signed statement in
hand, you have carte blanche permission to
call the prospects until they tell you to stop,
at which time you must stop immediately.
 You can call within the boundaries of the
law’s inquiry provision. This provision
allows a salesperson to make follow-up
calls for 90 days after the initial contact.
Use this 90-day period to make the sale or
prove your value so that the prospect
grants you written permission to become a
regular contact.
 You can call within the law’s 18-month
after-the-sale provision. This provision
allows a salesperson to make contact over
the 18-month period that follows the last
purchase, last payment, or last delivery of
services. In some cases, this provision cre-
ates a never-ending prospecting opportu-
nity. For instance, every single month you
make a credit card payment, you essen-
tially give your credit card company per-
mission to contact you for another eighteen
months — permission that won’t expire
until 18 months after the date when you
finally make your last payment.
Every three months, obtain from your broker a
current list of all contacts that your company
has permission to call with a sales script. As a
real estate agent, it’s essential that you work
inside the parameters of the law. The fine for
one offense is $11,000.

when they came through. And, in between, I also watched for the three, four, or
five listings that expired on a daily basis. Only a small group of agents work
expired listings as a way of life, but I can vouch for the fact that those who do
build great businesses.
Qualifying expired listings
When working expired listings, get ready to work with owners who are frus-
trated that their homes didn’t sell and who, in most cases, blame their agent
and, by association, all agents in their real estate market. Many also blame
the marketing strategy, the marketplace, and the lack of effort put forth by
the real estate community. They’re not happy campers.
In most cases, the blame is misplaced. The real culprit is usually the price the
owners expected to reap from their property sale. If you help them dive back
into the market with the same unrealistic price expectations, you’ll set your-
self up for another unhappy ending.
Your ability to qualify the owner’s level of motivation to sell at this time,
along with the current market conditions, will determine your likelihood 
of receiving a commission check. To help qualify your clients, find out the 
following:
 Are they determined to acquire a buyer at their current inflated sales
price?
 Which is more important: To obtain their desired price or to secure a
sale?
 Are they open to discussing the true market value of their home?
What you’re trying to find out with these questions is whether the owners
have to sell or just want to sell. Someone who is forced to sell is a higher-
grade prospect, and is more likely to result in a sale — and a commission
check — than someone who is just testing the market. Sellers who are being
transferred to another part of the state or country, who have financial diffi-
culties, who are expecting a child and living in a home that is too small, or
who are going through a divorce usually have to sell. While some of these sit-
uations are uncomfortable and unfortunate, they create opportunity for an
agent who can help them come to a successful conclusion.
Take time to ask questions and probe answers to find out the client’s situa-
tion. Many prospects are reluctant to reveal the reasons behind their deci-
sion to sell. Some feel an agent may try to take advantage of them — and
122
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

unfortunately in a few select cases, they may be right. The vast majority of
agents I’ve ever met, however, want to help people achieve their dreams and
desires.
The best way to extract the information that you need from clients is to keep
asking questions. If you don’t manage to get the answers but you feel that the
prospect has motivation, ask for a quick appointment to preview the home.
By getting in the door and meeting face to face with a seller, you stand a
better chance to get your questions answered while also having a look
around the property.
Calling the seller: What 
to say and how to say it
When you call the owner of a home with an expired listing, you have one
objective: To secure an appointment for a face-to-face meeting. Remember,
the owners will likely be contacted by dozens, if not hundreds, of other
agents, so you need to move quickly and skillfully by following this advice:
 Address their situation. Quickly convince the owners that if they
choose to work with you, the outcome will be different than the last
time. Explain why working with you provides them a higher probability
of sales success than they’ll receive by working with any other agent.
(Turn to Chapter 14 for help defining and concisely explaining your
unique and strong competitive position.)
 Be proactive. The most serious sellers will re-list their home within a
couple of days of a listing expiration. To land the listing, you can’t be
low-key with your dialogue and delivery. These owners are ready for
action. You must convey power, conviction, and belief in your ability to
achieve success.
 Leave yourself wiggle room. At this stage in the game, you may not be
aware of all the factors. You don’t know the condition of the home, the
neighborhood layout, the level of access the owners are granting to
buyers, the price and time frame they’re trying to achieve, the probabil-
ity that their expectations can be met, and what the previous agent
really did over the course of the listing term.
Because so much is up in the air, you have to leave yourself a little
wiggle room by not overcommitting to what you can and can’t do for the
client. You also don’t want to commit to what you would charge in terms
of commission. You need to be flexible depending on the market and
motivation of the prospect.
123
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

 Turn the most frequently asked questions to your advantage. Be ready
to answer the questions, “What will you do differently?” and “Why did
my home not sell?” by saying that you don’t have enough information to
give an accurate answer. You can say something like: “Are you asking me
to guess, or do you really want to know for sure?” When they say, “I want
to know for sure,” you book an appointment to see the house and have a
friendly discussion. With that helpful move, you get your foot in the
door.
 Gain information. The owners need to understand clearly that, without
firsthand knowledge of their situation, it’s impossible for you to deter-
mine which specific approaches would achieve their desired outcome.
You need to see their home in order to review its features, benefits, con-
dition, and curb appeal.
You also need to figure out the previous agent’s marketing strategy. Ask
the seller what the other agent did to market their property. If you can,
get previous agent’s flyers, ads, and brochures. Taking a look at the pre-
vious agent’s Web site may also help. Finally, you need to gain an under-
standing of the owners’ expectations regarding time frame, listing price,
sales price, and access for showings, as well as their interest in your
evaluation of the competition they face in the current marketplace.
 Differentiate yourself. Use your track record (or your firm’s track
record if you’re new in the business) to gain credibility with the owners.
(See Chapter 14 for tons of advice on how to use the Big Three Statistics
to differentiate and position your service.) As you present your success
story, do so with the caveat that your success is based on your outcome
with clients who sought your counsel, accepted your recommendations,
and implemented your advice. Tell the owners that you want to con-
tribute to a similarly successful outcome on their behalf. You may even
want to supply references of satisfied clients — especially those clients
whose listings were also expired before you began working with them.
 Provide the option of an easy exit. The seller with an expired listing
most likely wanted to fire the agent long before the listing term was up,
but in most cases, was bound by the contract terms to wait out the
agreement. Acknowledge your understanding that the owners feel cau-
tious about tying their home up for another long period of time. To put
the owners at ease, offer them an easy-exit listing agreement or include a
100 percent satisfaction-guaranteed clause. Either approach allows the
owner to sever the agreement any time before it expires, which greatly
reduces the perception of risk they may have about committing to
another agent.

Sales skills
Winning expired listings is the result of superb sales skills, including the 
following:
 Daily prospecting
 Focused dialogue
 Strong delivery
 Solid ability to handle objections
 Compelling description of the unique benefits you offer
 Ability to win appointments that end in listing agreements
As you initiate contact after the owners’ previous listing has expired, your
first objective isn’t to convince the owners to re-list with you. Instead, your
initial aim is to pique their interest and to make a compelling argument
regarding why they should take the time to see your presentation. The
sample scripts in the following section can help you plan your approach.
Sample scripts
Following are some sample scripts that you can build on when making initial
contact with the owner of an expired listing. No matter which script you
follow, remember this: Don’t get sidetracked. Stay focused on your single
objective, which is to secure an appointment with the owner.
Expired Script
Hi, I am looking for __________ (re-state the name). This is __________ with
__________.
Is your home still available?
OR
When do you plan to meet with agents about the job of selling your home?
OR
I noticed your home was no longer on the MLS. I was calling to see if you
still wanted to sell?
1. When you sell this home where are you hoping to move to?
2. Did you have a time frame to get there?
3. What do you think caused your home not to sell?
4. How did you select your previous agent?
125
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

5. What are your expectations of the next agent you choose?
6. Has anyone shared with you the real reason your home failed to sell?
7. There are only a few reasons homes fail to sell: exposure, changes in
market competition, and price. One you control, one the agent controls,
and one no one controls. Which do you think it is?
8. Let me ask you . . . do you want to know which one for sure?
9. All we need to do is meet for fifteen to twenty minutes and take a look at
your home. Would __________ or __________ be better for you?
Response to the objection that all agents are alike
Boy, I can sure understand where you get that impression and feeling. And I
know the kind of frustration you feel, because I’ve felt it myself when I’ve
taken over listings like yours only to find poorly written and prepared offers.
Mr. and Mrs. Seller, there really is a difference in agents. If there weren’t, we
would all be doing the same level of business in terms of listings, sales, time
on the market, and list-to-sale price. And we’d all have the same level of
client satisfaction. Wouldn’t you agree?
So the real question is what’s the difference, right? I would be delighted to
spend just a few minutes with you to help you understand the differences.
Would __________ or __________ be better for you this week?
Response to the question “Why are you calling me now?”
It sure seems like a lot of people are calling, doesn’t it? Your home’s listing
came up as expired, so I am calling to see if I can be of service. In order for
me to accurately assess my ability to help, I need just a few minutes of your
time and to see your home. Would _____________ or ____________ be better
for you this week?
Response to the question “Where were you when my home was listed?”
That’s a great question, and I’m sure this is a source of frustration for you
right now. I can assure you that I personally take the responsibility of selling
someone’s home very seriously. In many cases, my clients have entrusted
their largest asset to me.
Because of that trust, I work almost exclusively to ensure their sale. With a
98% success rate against the market average of 68% success rate, I must be
doing something right. Wouldn’t you agree? When would be the best time for
us to meet to evaluate your situation? Would __________ or __________ be
better for you?

Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Entering the For-Sale-By-Owner World
Converting FSBO listings involves a process that in a number of ways is simi-
lar to working with expired listings. However, the key differences between the
two areas are
 Timing. Most expired listings are re-listed and back on the market within
a matter of days while FSBOs convert at a much slower pace. If you con-
tact the owners of a FSBO, you can usually expect them to take at least a
few additional weeks to try and sell on their own before they commit the
listing to you.
 Sales approach. When working to convert an expired listing, you need
to take control in order to prevail over a bunch of other unknown agents
who are vying for the same listing. The owners of the expired listing
rarely have an agent preference at this point. Their “first-choice” agent
was the one whose sign just came down. This isn’t always the case with
FSBO owners, who sometimes have an agent in the wings just in case
they don’t have success on their own. For this reason, you need to take
a lower-key approach and work to build a relationship in order to win
over the FSBO listing.
Why bother with FSBOs?
When the marketplace is active and everything in sight seems to be selling, as
has been the case over the last few years, FSBO listings abound and FSBO
owners achieve a reasonable sales success rate without the services of an
agent. So, you may be wondering why an agent would even spend time trying to
convert FSBOs to agent-represented listings. Here are just a few good reasons:
 FSBOs are simply too tempting and attractive a market segment not to
work. You know who these owners are because they’re actively market-
ing their presence in the marketplace. You also know they have motiva-
tion or they wouldn’t be spending the money to advertise their home for
sale. It doesn’t make sense to ignore this great market segment, though
most agents do.
 Owners of FSBOs are qualified, motivated sellers. Clearly, they want to
sell, but they likely don’t realize the odds of the game they’re playing.
According to NAR, less than 30 percent of the people who try to sell
their own homes accomplish the task of selling and closing their 
transactions.
127
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

 Owners of FSBOs are viable client targets. Unlike other prospective
clients, you don’t have to wonder whether they own their home,
whether they’re serious about selling it, and whether they have the
authority and ability to conduct the deal.
 Owners of FSBOs are easy to find and reach. One of the most difficult
steps in the sales process is locating prospects in need of your service.
With FSBOs, like expired listings, you know who your prospects are, and
you know how to get in touch with them. Reaching FSBOs is easier than
reaching expired listings because FSBO sellers want to be found, as
detailed the section “Finding FSBO listings” later in this chapter.
 The vast majority of FSBOs fail to sell without an agent. Even in a
robust market, fewer than 30 percent of FSBOs sell themselves. This
means that more than 70 percent of the owners, if they want to sell, will
eventually enlist the services of a real estate agent.
 FSBO sellers often net lower prices than those achieved by agent-rep-
resented sellers. Among the 30 percent of FSBO homes that result in a
sale, most are priced right at or below fair market value. In fact, to FSBO
sellers, price is the primary marketing ammunition. The only reason a
buyer would take the additional risk of working with a FSBO is that
they’re trying to buy a home for less money than they’d spend on a tra-
ditional transaction. The problem is that low price is exactly the oppo-
site of what the homeowner is trying to achieve.
More than eight out of ten serious FSBOs end up as agent listings within a
reasonable period of time — usually four to five weeks. Originally, owners set
out to sell their own homes for one reason: They want to save money by not
paying the agent commission. They view the real estate commission that an
agent earns as too much pay for such an easy job. They think that money
would be better spent when put toward an additional down payment or a get-
out-of-debt plan. They ask themselves, “How hard can it be?” as they pound
the FSBO sign into their front yard. In the back of their minds, many think,
“Let’s give it a go. We’ll probably meet a few agents along the way, so we can
always change our minds.” And most do. After a month of the hassle, time,
energy, emotion, and stress of trying to sell their own home — after running
ads, fielding phone calls, holding open houses, and showing parades of
people through their home — 90 percent of homeowners rethink their situa-
tion. Fortunately for agents, selling a home isn’t all that easy.
Finding FSBO listings
Because FSBO owners want to be found, you don’t have to look far. Just do
the following:
128
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Check the newspaper. Because one of the primary advertising avenues
for FSBO owners is still print media, the newspaper is a great place to
look for FSBOs. The serious ones advertise regularly, spending a couple
hundred dollars a week on classified ads to promote their home. Most
don’t realize how fast the expense will mount up. They start out with an
advertising blitz for the first few weeks and then scale back as the reality
of the expense they’re incurring becomes apparent. You can use their ad
volume to gain information and to track sale progress.
 Drive around. Some owners quit advertising after a few weeks, and
others never start. But they all put signs in their yards. So that you don’t
miss out on any FSBOs, drive through your geographic area and area of
business at least once a month.
 Enlist the help of family and friends. Ask family members and friends
to be on the lookout for FSBOs. When I first got into real estate sales,
and I worked FSBOs, I would get a call each week from my mother and
my older brother, each calling with the addresses and phone numbers of
FSBOs they’d recently seen. They’d even share their first impressions
and offer to fax me the home flyers that they pulled from the yard signs.
Without my army of helpers, it would have taken longer to learn about
many of the FSBO homes I subsequently listed for sale.
 Subscribe to Landvoice. Landvoice is a company that compiles informa-
tion from FSBO newspaper ads, FSBO Web sites, and other real estate

Converting FSBO listings: The 
successful agent’s approach
Plan to take a patient approach to FSBOs. Realize that you can’t do or say
anything — short of offering to give your services away — that will rush the
owners’ decision to abandon the idea of selling their own home. Basically,
you’re playing a waiting game that you can’t win in a hurry, but that you can
quickly lose if you’re pushy or confrontational.
129
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

Agents who are filled with hyperbole about themselves and their service, or
who try to tell owners that FSBOs fail to sell themselves, use the wrong tactic.
Owners don’t want overly-confident agents making them feel like idiots for
trying to sell on their own — even if they are!
The best approach is to dial back your sales pitch and enhance your empha-
sis on service. Focus on helping the owners in their effort. Always encourage
them and wish them success, but don’t give away all your valuable services
without a signed contract.
Organizing your plan of attack
Confine your efforts to a concise geographic area that allows you to stop by
the FSBOs and see the owners as regularly as once every two weeks. When it
comes time for them to convert to an agent listing, they’ll find it harder to
reject you or choose not to interview you if they’ve met you and know you
personally.
If you work a large geographic area and are unable to whittle it down to a
more concise area, expect to encounter a great many FSBOs. The easiest way
to organize the opportunities is to track each home by the owners’ phone
numbers. Owners will change their ads and their asking prices, but they’ll
rarely change their phone numbers, and so by filing each home under its
phone number you’ll eliminate the risk of duplications.
I kept a lead sheet for each FSBO prospect and attached clippings of all ads
the owner had run. Whenever possible, I called the sellers and talked with
them about their ads, making suggestions about how they could improve
effectiveness. Then I’d watch for revisions. When they implemented the
changes I’d suggested, the update indicated that I had built a level of trust
with the prospect and that the likelihood of an interview was beginning to
skyrocket. As long as you keep them simple, you don’t need to worry about
making too many suggestions. Because the sellers are only accessing a very
small percentage of the marketplace of buyers, the chance of them selling
because of your guidance is small. However, you’ll gain trust a lot faster
through the appearance of helping them save the commission.
Remember, all you’re trying to do is gain a commitment that if and when the
owners decide to turn the job of selling their home over to an agent they will
interview you for the job.
Targeting your prospects
In targeting FSBOs for conversion, use the following selection criteria:
130
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Clear motivation to sell
 A short selling time frame
 A specific place they need to be by a certain date
 The capacity to sell at fair market value with a commission
 A high-demand home in a high-demand neighborhood
 Owners who don’t have a best friend or relative that is a real estate
agent
You need to ask owners these questions to understand how they fit into your
criteria. By asking, you then know which client to invest your time in.
The best approach to target FSBOs for conversion is to create a Top 10, Top
20, or even Top 30 list. If you try to work much beyond 30 FSBOs, excellent
service becomes a very difficult proposition. If you pursue the best 30 FSBOs,
knowing that 80 percent — or 24 of the 30 — are likely to list in the next 60
days, then you have 24 solid prospects, or about 12 a month.
If you provide solid advice, counsel, service, and care, you can get half of
those 12 to interview with you. Depending on your skill in the interview, you
could convert anywhere from two to five into listings each month. Think
about it: A business source that generates five listings a month is a great
source of business. And even if it delivers only two a month, that’s still 24 list-
ings a year. Not bad!
Making the initial contact
Making initial contact with owners of FSBO homes is the toughest step for
most agents, so I recommend that you make calls as soon as you see a FSBO
come onto the market. I’ve had coaching clients who would buy the Sunday
paper on Saturday afternoon just to get the FSBO classifieds. By doing this,
they could call owners of new listings to have a professional conversation
before the onslaught of calls from other agents began to come through.
By being the first to place a call over the weekend, before other agents made
their calls on the next workday, my clients found owners more open to dia-
logue. They also found it easier to distinguish themselves when they were the
first to get through, rather than after 50 other agents had already done so.
Another benefit to calling FSBO owners early on Saturday or Sunday is that
you leave your afternoons free to drop in on some FSBO open houses.
Meeting owners face to face in their own homes presents an effective way to
establish contact. The owners are sure to be home, they’re expecting visitors,
and they’re ready to make contact and discuss the sale of their home.
131
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

Putting the mail carrier to work
Due to the four-to-five week sales cycle involved in converting FSBOs to list-
ings, you can use mailers more effectively with them than you can when deal-
ing with expired listings. By mailing helpful items once or twice a week, you
give yourself a reason to make follow-up phone calls on a regular basis.
After every face-to-face or phone contact, follow up with a handwritten thank-
you note. The owners are getting mail from many other real estate agents, so
to avoid the round file (aka the trash can), personalize your notes with hand-
written exterior addresses.
Also, use your mailers to send useful information that the sellers may need.
Too often, agents act like adversaries of FSBO sellers. Take a different and
better approach by helping them out. Most have no idea what they really need
to do to complete the sale. For example, if they receive helpful advice from
you every five days, when it comes time to sign their home over to a listing
agent they’re more likely to think favorably of your interview invitation.
To use mailers effectively follow the following suggestions:
 Send the owners a property disclosure form and information on disclo-
sure laws, including how the law affects the value and sale of their home.
Buyers can back out even at the last minute if the owners don’t handle
this detail properly.
 Send a sample purchase and sale contract and maybe a counter offer
form, along with the explanation that nothing ever gets agreed upon in
the first contract.
 Send owners of older homes a lead-based paint disclosure form to give
to the buyer of the home, if appropriate.
 Ask your lender to prepare a financing sheet that the owners can give to
the buyer.
 Send numerous other items to service FSBO sellers and create a connec-
tion, including:
• Sample net revenue sheets
• Sample walk-through inspection forms
• Updated market analysis reports of comparable properties
• Sample brochures or photos of the owners’ home
• Guest registers for use at showings
• Lead tracking forms to log information on people who call about
the home
132
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

• Lists of homes that would meet the owners’ needs if they’re look-
ing to purchase a new home in the area.
• Free reports about selling their home.
Free reports are an effective device because they enable owners to educate
themselves and increase their likelihood of success while simultaneously
positioning you as the expert. By sending these reports, you establish your-
self as a strong resource to help them succeed. Then, when they don’t suc-
ceed, you’ll be there to pick up the pieces and list and sell their home.
As you prepare to send free reports, consider using titles such as: “Selling
your home yourself for the highest possible price” or “The seven mistakes
most FSBO homeowners make that cost them thousands in their sales price.”
For free downloadable samples of these types of reports, go to our Web site
at www.realestatechampions.com.
Dialing for dollars
As you work your high-priority FSBO homeowners, make phone or in-person
contact at least twice a week. Use these communications to see how sales
activity has been, whether a weekend open house is scheduled, whether they
received your latest mailing, and, most importantly, whether they got the
home sold.
A portion of FSBOs sell on their own, but a big difference lies between getting
a home sold and getting it closed. The fact that the owners achieved a sale
doesn’t mean that they’ll get their money. The quality of buyers that shop
FSBOs is lower than that of those who shop homes listed in the MLS. For this
reason, when FSBO sellers report that they’ve sold their home, keep follow-
ing up. A large number of these sales fall apart before closing. When that hap-
pens, sellers who thought they were on the downhill slope wave a white flag
and call in a real estate agent. Make sure that you’re still in touch when that
moment of frustration arrives.
Overcoming rejection and staying resilient
FSBO sellers will reject you because they would prefer not to use your ser-
vices. But if you maintain a steady, professional relationship, offering help and
staying in contact for four to five weeks, you’ll usually be able to win an inter-
view. From there, if you have excellent presentation skills, a listing follows.
Increase your odds of success by taking these two precautions:
 Limit the number of FSBOs you cultivate. Focus only on the best
clients, as described in the section titled “Targeting your prospects” ear-
lier in this chapter
133
Chapter 7: Winning Business from Expired and FSBO Listings

 Avoid prospects with low motivation or unrealistically high price
expectations. These sellers are usually the most toxic, and too often
they’ll try to take their frustrations out on you.
134
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 
When most salespeople quit
The reason that agents who pursue expired list-
ings and FSBOs are so effective in securing list-
ings is because most agents either don’t
attempt to compete or, if they do, they compete
on a haphazard basis, usually quitting long
before the sale is made.
If you’re going to succeed in sales, you have to
get used to hearing the word “no” more often
than you hear the word “yes.”
If prospects always said yes, real estate agents
wouldn’t be salespeople. Instead they would be
called order takers. They would just take some-
one’s order, confirm its accuracy, and fulfill it as
if they’re working the counter at the local
McDonald’s, with no selling involved.
Beyond that, if prospects always said yes, our
income or payment for services would plum-
met. One of the reasons that real estate agents
usually get paid so well is that they’re compen-
sated for dealing with prospect rejection and
finding solutions when answers aren’t readily
available.
Study after study has confirmed that most
salespeople quit long before the sale occurs
because they can’t take the rejection. For
example:
 44 percent of salespeople quit trying the
first time the prospect tells them no. In
other words, at the first point of resistance,
nearly half of all salespeople quit trying to
win the sale and earn a commission.
 22 percent of salespeople quit the second
time the prospect says no. That means that
two-thirds of salespeople eliminate their
chance of a paycheck after two small road-
blocks.
 14 percent of salespeople quit after the
prospect says no for the third time.
 12 percent of salespeople quit and go home
after a fourth no.
Imagine that! 92 percent of salespeople bail out
after four attempts to get the sale. That means
that only 8 percent of all salespeople continue
after the fourth rejection.
Here’s the amazing number: The studies further
prove that more than 60 percent of all sales are
completed after the prospect has said no at
least four times. Maybe the prospects said no
due to the terms and condition, maybe they
needed more information and clarification,
maybe their schedules didn’t allow for the pur-
chase, or maybe the timing was just plain lousy.
In any case, the end result is that 92 percent of
salespeople were missing in action by the time
the seller was ready to say yes. That means
that 8 percent of the salespeople control 60 per-
cent of the business, simply because they’re
there to ask for the sale when the buyer is
ready.

Playing the game of lead follow-up
Working FSBOs fundamentally turns into a game of lead follow-up. You need
to personally and regularly contact your FSBO leads to discover their motiva-
tion and qualifications, book face-to-face meetings, disqualify prospects as
necessary, provide regular service and communication, and schedule presen-
tation appointments. Then you need to repeat the service and communica-
tion steps several times weekly until the listing is in hand.
Coming face to face
To make personal contact, begin by asking the FSBO seller if you can come by
and see the home. You can ask them in a few different ways. You can explain
that you want to stay informed of the regional housing inventory, you can say
that you’re working with buyers who may be interested, you can present
yourself as a potential investor, or, when you can, you can use the reverse-no
technique. The idea of this technique is to get your client to say “no,” which
you end up reversing into a “yes” for business. For example, you can ask your
client the following: “Would you be offended if I came by to take a look at
your home?” “No” is what she really wants to say, but instead, you end up
reversing the “no” into a “yes.” Following are sample scripts for each
approach.
Script for keeping up with the inventory:
Mr. Seller, your home is located in my core area of sales. Because it is, I
would like to come by and preview your home. Would there be a time on
__________ or __________ to do that this week?
Script for working with the prospective buyer:
Ms. Seller, I understand you are selling your home on your own. Let me ask
you this: Are you cooperating with real estate agents? What I mean is, if a
real estate agent brought you a qualified buyer at an agreeable price to you,
would you be willing to pay a partial commission?
We are working with a few buyers for your area that we have not been able
to place yet. May I come by on __________ or __________ later this week to
see your home?
When you use the above approach, understand that you’re not interested in
reducing your commission. What you’re really trying to do is achieve a face-
to-face appointment to collect more information on their sellers’ motivation
in order to determine the probability of securing a listing in the future.

Script for a potential investor:
Mr. Seller, your home is located in a solid area for real estate investment. I
was wondering if I could come by to see your home as a principle for possi-
ble purchase, to see if it is a property that would meet my investment needs.
Would __________ or __________ be better for you?
In using the above approach, realize that the key phrase is “investment
needs.” You’ll rarely find a FSBO that meets your investment needs. My per-
sonal investment need is a home that can be acquired at a 70 percent dis-
count below fair market value, whereas most FSBOs are trying to sell their
homes at 110 percent of fair market value. However, this technique will get
you in the door to see the home and talk with them.
Script for a reverse-no:
Ms. Seller, would you be offended if I came by to take a quick look at your
home?
The reverse-no technique can be used with any script. It capitalizes on the
normal reflexive human reaction of “no” in order to achieve a positive
response. It opens the door and allows you to then set an appointment.
FSBO Survey Script
Hi, this is __________ from __________. I am looking for the owner of the
home for sale.
Your home is in my core area. I am doing a quick survey of the FSBOs in
this area. May I take a few minutes to ask you some questions?
The ad in the paper said that you had _____ bedrooms and _____ bathrooms.
 Do you have a two-level or one-level home?
 Are all the bedrooms on the same floor?
 Are they good-sized rooms?
 How is the condition of the kitchen?
 Are the bathrooms in good condition?
 Can you describe your yard for me?
 Is there anything else you feel I should know?
 It sounds like you have a great home; how long have you lived there?
 Why are you selling at this time?
136
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Where are you hoping to move to now?
 What is your time frame to get there?
 How did you happen to select that area to move to?
 How did you determine your initial asking price for the home?
 What techniques are you using for exposure and marketing of your
home?
 Are you aware that over 86 percent of the buyers for properties begin
on the Internet now?
 If there was a clear advantage for you in using me to market and
expose your home, and it cost you very little, would you consider it?
 Let’s simplify. Set a time to get together for fifteen to twenty minutes,
so I can see your home and understand your objectives. I have time
available __________, or would __________ be better for you?
Building relationships
FSBO relationships are built over time. By introducing yourself to the owners
the first weekend their FSBO is announced, before the masses start calling on
Monday, you create a good connection. By sending them tools, educational
materials, free reports, and forms, you become an ally. By taking a personal
interest in them and their situation, you create a solid connection that, in
many cases, pays off when the owners decide to go with an agent they know
and trust — preferably you.
Over the course of building a relationship with the owners, you’ll be able to
get them to understand that in every real estate transaction a commission is
paid. In the end, FSBO sellers don’t save the commission. Rather, they try to
earn the commission by doing an agent’s job. In doing so, they spend a great
deal of their money and time to perform, as best they can, the duties of an
agent. Those duties include exposing the home through marketing, present-
ing the home to buyers, building a sense of buyer urgency in order to prompt
an offer, scheduling home inspections, handling qualification checks with the
lender, supervising repairs, and facilitating the closing.
FSBO owners unwittingly let buyers basically steal the “saved” commission
through under-priced offers. People don’t shop FSBOs because it’s the cool
thing to do. They do so because they know they can secure a low price and a
high initial equity position.
By building a relationship over time, you’ll demonstrate your value to the
FSBO seller. Whether you’re working with FSBOs or expired listings, your goal
is simply to be one of the two, three, or four agents that the owner will inter-
view when the time comes. You just want the opportunity to compete and
make your presentation.

Planning and Hosting a
Successful Open House
In This Chapter

I
f you’re one of the many real estate agents who think open houses are only
good for selling the home being shown — or if you judge success by the
number of sales you generate as a result of your open houses — expect this
chapter to redirect your thinking.
Well-documented research shows that fewer than 5 percent of all buyers pur-
chased a home they visited during an open house. This finding proves the
open house to be, at best, a pretty ineffective sales approach.
Despite this research, open houses are an important tool in an agent’s 
business arsenal for a very good reason: Open houses give you a setting to
show your audience what a great agent you are, ultimately providing a terrific
opportunity to generate prospects. And all savvy agents know that prospects
are the lifeblood of real estate business success.
Count on this chapter to help you plan, stage, and host open houses that gen-
erate buyer prospects, listing prospects, and — if the stars align just right —
perhaps a buyer for the home you’re showing.

Why Host an Open House?
Open houses aren’t the best vehicles for selling homes. So why do real estate
agents bother with them? For the following reason: Open houses are a great
means for prospecting.
An open house provides a real estate agent with a neighborhood store front
from which to do business for a day. Each time you host an open house, you
set up shop in a client home and open the doors to the opportunity to meet
prospects, establish relationships, and expand your real estate clientele.
If your real estate business could benefit from an influx of buyer or seller
prospects, start staging more open houses. You can hardly find a more effec-
tive way to generate leads face to face. And, as a bonus, occasionally your
efforts will net a sale. Not a bad bonus for a solid prospecting tool.
Think of the open house as the real estate agent’s equivalent to the retailer’s
loss leader, which is something that creates the initial opening for a sale. In
the same way that a grocery store manager offers milk at a discounted price
to draw shoppers into the store, a real estate agent invests time and money
in an open house to build traffic, attract prospects, hand out business cards,
and cultivate sales of other products.
When I was selling real estate, I wasn’t a big fan of open houses. I wanted 
to keep Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays free so that I could take a scenic 
three-hour drive and enjoy the weekend with my family at our vacation home.
Obviously, I couldn’t have it both ways, so I opted out of open houses. But that
was then and this is now. A lot has happened to change the way real estate
agents work. The impact of the Internet, the time-draining effects of dual-income
families, and the record low number of homes for sale have combined to put a
new emphasis on the importance of open houses and why you should host
them. Open houses rarely lead directly to the sale of the house in question, 
but as the following sections explain, they present many other benefits.
A chance to meet potential 
clients face to face
The explosion of online real estate marketing and shopping has led to a 
dramatic drop in the number of phone-to-phone and face-to-face meetings
between real estate agents and their prospects. The open house provides a
proven way to gain clear and easy real-time access to prospects that are
ready to buy or sell homes.
140
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

In addition to giving you the opportunity of meeting all the home shoppers
who drop in, an open house gives you the opportunity to meet neighbors and
friends of the home’s owners — all of whom may end up in the real estate
buyer or seller market in the future. Take time to figure out the needs, wants,
time frames, and motivations behind each person’s home-shopping experi-
ence. Form a connection with the home shoppers. Once they meet and visit
with you, home shoppers find rejecting you as “just a salesperson” much
more difficult.
141
Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool
So, what’s in it for the sellers?
You’re probably asking yourself, “But what’s in
this open house thing for the seller?” Why
would homeowners agree to be booted out of
their houses for the afternoon so that their
agents can throw open the doors in an effort to
attract prospective new clients? And why do
sellers care if their agents generate new leads,
anyway?
While you may have these questions, sellers
rarely, if ever, ask them.
That’s because most sellers have no idea of the
limited results that are likely to result from an
agent holding an open house in their home. In
fact, if you survey most sellers, you find that
they desperately want their agent to hold an
open house for their home. They hold fast to the
belief that an open house may sell their home.
However, the odds are low: Homes are sold
directly through open houses only one out of
every twenty times. And it seems that every
seller knows someone whose home was one of
those few open house sales success stories.
They inaccurately apply one owner’s experi-
ence as the rule instead of the exception. As a
result, they want an open house, ASAP.
To sellers, an open house is a tangible way to
see agents doing something to earn their fees.
The selling of real property is a mystery to most
people, but they can easily understand an open
house because it isn’t part of the behind-the-
scenes magic that an agent performs to get the
home sold.
Sellers actually see some real advantages from
the open house experience. Open houses do
sell homes — just not the featured home and
not usually to a prospect who attended the
open house. For example:
 An open house attendee may share her
home-buying interests with the hosting
agent, who proceeds to sell her a home
featured at an open house a week ago.
 A couple attending an open house may find
that the featured home isn’t right for them
but that it matches the wish list of some
good friends, who end up making a pur-
chase offer.
What’s more, an open house prompts the
owners to get their home ready for prime-time
showing, and that alone makes it worthwhile
for all parties involved. Whether the home sells
as a result of the open house (as only a few do)
or afterwards, the effort provides a worthwhile
dry run for all the showings that’ll follow.

A way to meet the needs 
of dual-income families
The ever-growing number of dual-income families has put leisure time at an
absolute premium. Getting a prospect from this category into your office is a
feat. However, motivated buyers frequently attend open houses on their own,
as couples, or as families. When they do, you have the advantage of watching
them react to a home. You can discover a lot by observing them in the house,
noting the features that interest them, overhearing their concerns, and visu-
ally tracking their reactions. You also have the chance to visit with them,
which is the beginning of turning a casual open house visit into a lasting 
business relationship.
A means of catering to the do-it-
yourselfer’s home-buying needs
Over recent years, much of the U.S. has experienced a record low inventory
of homes for sale. As a result, consumers are programmed to believe that
finding a good home for sale is a tough task and that when a good home
comes on the market it won’t last long.
For that reason, more and more prospects have taken home searches into
their own hands in the following ways:
 They actively search out listings online.
 They aggressively shop the swelled ranks of homes for sale by owner,
which are also known as FSBOs.
 They spend their weekends doing home shopping “leg work.”
 They attend open houses in droves.
When do-it-yourself home shoppers drop into your open house, you’re safe
to bet on two things:
 They’re serious about finding a home for sale.
 They aren’t represented by agents.
In other words, they’re great buyer prospects.
142
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

A high-touch opportunity 
in a high-tech world
One of the big challenges facing real estate agents in today’s wired world is
learning the identities of their prospective clients. Home shoppers cruise and
click their way around hundreds of real estate Web sites, requesting informa-
tion via e-mail from scores of agents without ever revealing more than an
e-mail address.
As an agent, you can respond with an e-mail that provides the requested
information, but it hardly allows you the chance to provide your professional
counsel and to establish a professional relationship.
For one thing, it’s almost impossible to distinguish yourself from other agents
via e-mail. Also, while e-mail allows you to communicate promptly, it doesn’t
allow you to easily determine the desire, need, ability, and buying authority
of the prospect. Communicating over e-mail also stops you from determining
the prospect’s motivation and time frame and from customizing your advice
to the prospect’s unique situation.
That’s where open houses come to your rescue. Open houses cut through 
the electronic interface and put you right in front of prospective buyers 
and sellers — from there you can distinguish yourself, define your prospect’s
interests, and begin the professional relationship that leads to real estate 
success.
143
Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool
How many open houses should I host?
Real estate agents always seek a magic for-
mula that defines how many open houses to
host and when to host them. I hate to disappoint
you, but I haven’t found a pat answer. However,
here are a few good guidelines to follow:
 If you’re a new agent trying to build a clien-
tele and get your business off the ground,
host open houses weekly, or at least regu-
larly and frequently. Volunteer to hold open
houses for the listings of other agents in
your company.
 If you’re an established agent working to
increase your business and win market
share (see Chapter 14 for more on the topic
of market share), add up how many open
houses you’ve hosted over recent months
and aim to increase that figure at least pro-
portionately to the amount you’re working
to increase your business.
 If open houses are fundamental to your
lead-generation strategy, you should hold
an event at least several times each month.

Setting and Achieving Your 
Open House Objectives
Regardless of the nature of your business or the frequency of your open
houses, don’t proceed with another open house before establishing your
objectives and expectations for each open house event.
The main purpose of an open house is to attract solid buyer and seller
prospects, so when setting your objectives for each open house, you need to
shift your focus away from selling the featured home and toward acquiring
prospects.
Before each open house, set your prospecting objectives, including the
following:
 Number of visitors you hope to meet and greet. Your answer depends
on the size of your market area and the appeal of the home. Once you
establish an objective for the number of visitors you expect to host, set
the percentage of guests you intend to personally meet. The closer that
percentage is to 100, the more effective you’ll be in using the open house
as a prospecting tool.
 Number of contacts from whom you hope to collect information for
use in future mailings and other forms of follow up. Not everyone is will-
ing to share personal contact information, but with skill and effort you
can expect to gather lead information from at least 50 percent of guests.
For success, follow these tips:
• Have a sign-in sheet and tell guests that you’ve been asked by the
seller to track the attendees from the open house, and ask if they
would they please help you keep that commitment to the seller.
Don’t pounce on them when they enter the door. Instead, wait 
until they settle in for a moment.
At the bottom of the sign-in sheet, be sure to state that by signing
in on this sheet they’re agreeing to allow you to contact them in
the future with real estate information. This helps you stay legal
with the “no-call” laws that are in effect.
• Have your business card ready to hand to people that walk in. As
you hand it to them, ask for theirs at the same time. Often without
thinking they’ll dig into their purse or wallet and automatically
hand you their contact information.
 Number of buyer interviews you hope to schedule. Again, no single magic
figure exists, but my recommendation is that you aim to achieve interviews
144
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

from at least 25 percent of the guests who provide you with follow-up con-
tact information. To achieve interviews, consider these steps:
• Ask for the opportunity to meet. You could use a script like this:
“Bob and Mary, in order for you to maximize you initial equity posi-
tion and minimize your upfront costs in securing a new home for
your family, we simply need to meet. Would ________ or__________
be better for you this week?”
• Most people at open houses also are sellers. They need to sell their
current homes in order to make a new home purchase possible.
Ask to come by and take a look at their home. Use script such as:
“Bob and Mary, would you be offended if I came by to take a look
at your home? Would _______ or ___________be better for you this
week?”
• If you can’t secure a face to face appointment, aim to at least set a
specific time that you can contact attendees by phone. Then you
can work to at least acquire an over-the-phone appointment for a
specific day and specific time to speak next. Simply agreeing to call
them later in the week is not good enough.
Refer to the upcoming section titled “Being the Host with the Most: Effectively
Managing the Open House” for help planning the strategy to follow to achieve
your attendance, lead-generation, and prospecting objectives.
Planning Your Open Houses 
to Gain Maximum Exposure
Open house success follows five clear rules in order to ensure the greatest
return on your investment of time, money, and resources. If one of your current
listings doesn’t meet the following five criteria I wouldn’t hold the home open:
 Rule 1: Feature an attractive home in a high-demand area.
 Rule 2: Choose a home with great curb appeal.
 Rule 3: Market to the neighbors.
 Rule 4: Play the risk/reward odds by selecting a home in the upper-
middle price range. (See the section titled “Don’t skimp: Featuring a
home in the upper-middle price range” for more details.)
 Rule 5: Lead prospects to the home with easy-to-follow signage.
145
Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool

The following sections provide advice on how to achieve each of these five
success factors.
Featuring a high-appeal home
Here’s a hard truth to swallow: No one comes to an open house to meet the
agent. They come to see an appealing home, and your role as the hosting
agent is to make that house shine. Your reward is the list of prospects you
amass, and, one out of twenty times, a home sale to boot.
As you prepare for an open house, think of the home you’re featuring as the
headliner of the show. Choose a home with star power by following these
points:
 Select a home in a high-demand, low-inventory area. Scarcity is a well-
proven marketing strategy. People line up to get into crowded restaurants.
They respond enthusiastically when told they’re limited to “one per cus-
tomer.” And they’ll show up at your open house in flocks if the home you’re
showing is one of only a few for sale in a well-regarded neighborhood.
 Do your homework before making your selection final. Study the
inventory levels in the neighborhood you’re considering for your open
house. Obtain the prices of recent sales to be sure that your home is
within the acceptable range. Research the number of days that recent
sales and current listings have been on the market. Then compare your
findings with research on nearby neighborhoods to be sure that the
home you’re considering competes well.
The statistics you compile provide you with information you should be
tracking anyway, so even if you rule out the home you’re studying, the
time you spend on the effort is worthwhile.
Open house selection isn’t a time for guesswork. Use your market knowledge
to choose a home with high appeal and demand. Rely on gut instinct only
when you’re deciding between two homes with equal market appeal.
Looking good: Leveraging 
the power of curb appeal
All agents have seen it happen: A prospect pulls up alongside an open house,
touches the brakes, takes a careful look, and then drives off without ever
going inside. Nine times out of ten, the house lost the drive-by test. It lacked
curb appeal.
146
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

It’s your job as an agent to counsel the home sellers to turn the house exte-
rior into a perfect 10.
In preparation for an open house, you at least want to work with the owners
on the two areas that most significantly affect the home shopper’s first
impression: landscaping and paint color and quality. (For complete informa-
tion on getting the house ready for showing, flip to Chapter 11.)
Landscaping for fun and profit
Typical landscaping reaches maturity after about six to eight years, and after
that it needs to be thinned and reshaped.
If the home you’re showing is in a mature neighborhood and the landscaping
is overgrown, convince the owner to enhance curb appeal by following these
steps:
 Spend a day trimming and removing overgrown and excessive plants.
Hosting an open house in a home blocked from the street by a jungle is a
formula for disappointment. Your drive-by prospect will see only
untended bushes and trees — hardly a great first impression.
 Plant or place seasonal flowers that add color, warmth, and an invit-
ing first glance. A few hundred dollars of seasonal flowers can dramati-
cally change the appearance of a “plain Jane” house.
Choosing paint color that flatters
Exterior paint color and condition is often the first thing that a prospective
buyer notices about a home. To make the first impression a good one, urge
the homeowner to consider this advice:
 Installing shutters in a complimentary accent color can transform
even the most boring ’50s-style ranch house.
 Adding an alternate type of siding in a small, strategic area in the front
can improve the look of the home. By adding fish scale siding or a shake
siding accent on a wood exterior face or over the garage gable, you can
transform the home’s first impression from ordinary to extraordinary.
 Painting the home in a widely acceptable color scheme helps it appeal
to the greatest number of prospective buyers. Face it, while a few
people may fall in love with a home painted robin’s egg blue with pink
trim, most buyers have a hard time imagining it in any other color, and
so they drive right on past after the first glance. (Don’t laugh. I once sold
a home with exactly those paint colors.)
147
Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool

Inviting the neighbors
Many agents achieve greater open house results from neighborhood market-
ing efforts than from general public exposure. As you plan your open house
announcement strategy, pay special attention to your nearest prospects by
marketing to those who live right around the house you’re showing. Follow
these steps:
 Consider a neighborhood “sneak preview.” Invite neighbors into the
house an hour before the home opens to the general public.
 Send at least 25 invitations to generate an adequate neighborhood
response. Better yet, hand-deliver 25 invitations. Before you allow 
yourself to assume that door-to-door delivery is too time-consuming,
realize that this simple touch will increase your invitation response 
rate dramatically.
 Use neighborhood events to gain access to prospects in restricted-
access neighborhoods. Restricted-access neighborhoods include gated
communities or condo complexes that require the public — including
real estate agents — to gain permission before entering. This entry bar-
rier makes prospecting in these areas difficult at best. So whenever you
achieve a listing in a restricted-access neighborhood, leverage the
opportunity to stage an open house neighborhood preview that allows
you to meet and establish relationships with surrounding homeowners.
Don’t skimp: Feature a home in 
the upper-middle price range
Every marketplace can be broken down into the following real estate price
categories: Lower-end, lower-middle, middle, upper-middle, and upper-end.
Build your real estate practice around the upper-middle price point position
to allow yourself the greatest sales flexibility and business success. The
upper-middle price point provides the following:
 Risk-reward benefit. All prospects require similar amounts of time and
energy, yet those that result in the sale or purchase of an upper-middle
or upper-end property deliver far higher commission revenue.
 Positioning flexibility. By positioning yourself to serve the upper-
middle price range, you won’t get pigeonholed. You won’t get painted as
148
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

that snobby agent who sells only the upper-end and you won’t get
tagged as the agent who works only the low-end. You can easily move
within all five price segments, migrating to wherever the market is most
robust at the moment.
 Quality clientele. By specializing in upper-middle properties, you’ll
attract quality middle-range prospects who aspire to own more exclu-
sive properties, even if they can’t quite afford them. Plus you also
attract buyers with the financial ability to migrate to the upper-end.
 Quality lead generation. By working the upper-middle price bracket
and by holding open houses that serve the upper-middle price category,
you set yourself up to collect buyer and seller leads and grow your busi-
ness within that lucrative price range.
Showing the way: Leading prospects 
to the open house
Open house advertising is important, but it pales in comparison to the impor-
tance of a well-selected open house site and a signage strategy that leads
prospects to your open house front door.
In choosing your open house site, make sure you do the following:
 Select a home near a well-traveled street to gain exposure from the
traffic volume.
Be careful that the home isn’t too close to the traffic or you’ll get traffic
by the home but not to the home. Remember that buyers are reluctant to
live too close to a thoroughfare or busy street.
 Hold your open house in a home that is no more than three direc-
tional signs away from a well-traveled street. Otherwise you’ll lose
prospects as they try to navigate what feels like a maze.
 When running ads, announce the open house using on-the-hour start
times. For instance, announce that the open house runs from noon to 3
p.m. or from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., rather than from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. or
from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.
On-the-hour start times help prospects remember the time of your open
house, and it enables them to fit it into the schedule of open houses
they’re visiting in a single day.

Being the Host with the Most: Effectively
Managing the Open House
A successful open house requires a well-chosen and presentable home, a well-
organized host, and an impeccable follow-up plan so that no prospect gets lost
in the post-event period. Use the following information to guide your planning.
In addition, you may want to use the worksheet featured in Figure 8-1 to be
sure you cover all the planning bases and arrive ready to open the doors to a
successful event.
Doing your homework before 
prospects arrive
Before you swing open the doors to open house guests, be sure the home is
clean, bright, and welcoming — and be sure that you’re ready to present not
only the home you’re showing but other homes that may better fit the inter-
ests of your prospects.
Presenting the home you’re featuring
Arrive at the open house with flyers or feature sheets presenting the prop-
erty you’re showing. Bring enough copies to provide one to each visitor as a
way of reminding the prospect of the home and, especially, of you. A few tips:
 Keep the feature sheets simple.
 Include a picture of the home and information about bedrooms, bath-
rooms, square footage, and amenities.
 Include your picture and contact information.
Research proves that most guests will not buy the home you’re showing, but
they may very well buy into the idea of working with you on their future
home sale or purchase. The feature sheet will provide prospects with infor-
mation on how to contact you.
Discussing other available properties
Before the open house, arm yourself with information on about half a dozen
other homes that are similar in price, amenities, neighborhood status, and
geography to the one you’re showing. Then, when an open house guest indi-
cates a lack of interest in the home you’re showing, you’re prepared to
quickly and easily shift the discussion to another possibility.

Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool

The best research approach is to personally tour each home so that you fully
understand and can quickly describe its attributes and how it differs from the
home you’re showing. Then, if a prospect expresses to you that the open
house home wouldn’t work because the back yard is too small, for example,
you’ll have first-hand knowledge with which to describe the large yard of
another home you can recommend.
Shooing the homeowners out the door
Having the seller underfoot during an open house only causes barriers
between you and the potential prospects. You must make arrangements for
the seller to be away during open house hours and here’s why:
 Without intending to do so, the owner may convey to the prospect a
strong desire to move, causing the prospect to believe that the owner is
anxious to sell, which may prompt a lower initial offer.
 The seller may say something that raises a red flag about the condition
of the property.
 The seller may describe his or her favorite things about the house. If
these features are ones the buyer dislikes and was thinking about chang-
ing, the seller’s input may simply shut down interest in the home.
Most sellers want to help you sell their homes and, the truth is, the best help
they can provide is being absent during the open house.
Setting the mood with last-minute touches
Right before opening the doors to your open house, take a few moments to
enhance the warm, welcoming feeling attendees want to feel upon arrival.
 Throw open blinds to expose nice views.
 Turn on lights to brighten corners.
 Burn candles and plug in air fresheners to scent air.
 Play soft music to fill the air.
 Set out simple but tasteful refreshments to encourage attendees to
linger. (For some thoughts regarding refreshments, see the sidebar titled
“Gaining customers without home-baked cookies.”)
 Place a guest book or sign-in sheet, along with a pen, in the entryway or
at a point where guests gather.
 Keep a stack of business cards and house flyers in a visible location.

Wallflower or social butterfly: Meeting
and greeting during the open house
Your primary objective during the open house is to meet guests and sell guests
on meeting with you. Your measurement for success is how many appoint-
ments you book for after-the-open-house buyer interviews, which are meetings
during which you determine the prospect’s motivation, time frame, wants, and
needs, and the prospect learns how you work and what services you provide.
Successful buyer interviews conclude with a prospect commitment, which takes
the form of a signed buyer-agency agreement. This agreement is a contract to
exclusively represent the buyer. At its core, the buyer-agency agreement is like
a listing agreement where your compensation is guaranteed if the buyer buys.
If the buyer buys any home (one that is listed and on the MLS or that is an FSBO)
you’ll be compensated for your time, effort, and energy. The single best way to
obtain a buyer interview is to convince the prospect when you’re face to face at
the open house that you’re the best real estate resource based on:
153
Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool
Gaining customers without home-baked cookies
Certainly, one objective of an open house is to
get the prospect to linger in the home.
Obviously, the more time the prospect spends
at your event, the more time you have to estab-
lish a relationship and communicate the value
you can bring to that person’s sale or purchase
transaction. And a great way to get customers
to stay a while is to serve refreshments. On that
point, nearly all agents agree.
The debate starts when the discussion turns to
which kinds of refreshments are best.
Some agents insist that the single best
approach is to serve warm cookies straight
from the open-house oven. The result is a two-
for-one: Refreshments plus an aroma-filled
home. I know of one husband and wife team
that takes the idea even further, filling the house
with the scent of a roast dinner, which they
cook for their sellers while the open house is
underway. As you might imagine, they generate
a waiting list of people wanting them to hold
open houses in their homes.
I personally believe that all this kitchen activity
advances the wrong message to prospects.
They aren’t looking for the next Emeril. They’re
looking for a sales professional to represent
them in the largest single transaction of their
lives.
My advice is to save the time you’d spend
baking cookies and invest it instead into devel-
opment of your sales skills. Find out how to con-
vert an open house guest to a buyer or seller
prospect by addressing that person’s interests
and needs, and you’ll never need to don an
oven mitt.

 Your superb knowledge of the marketplace
 Your high level of professional service
 Your ability to deliver a buyer advantage in the marketplace
 Your ability to facilitate the best lender arrangements and the smoothest
closing transaction
 Your experience saving buyers’ money in the short run via lower sales
prices or initial down payments, or in the long run via reduced payments
 Your commitment to delivering the quality representation that the
prospect truly deserves
Most agents who host open houses are too interested in obtaining contact
information so they can initiate rounds of mailings and follow-up activity.
Don’t let your objective get off-track. Your aim is to get an appointment (not
just contact info) so that you can make a personal presentation.
The big difference between highly and marginally successful agents can be
measured by the number of appointments they schedule and conduct daily,
weekly, monthly, and annually. When you host an open house, keep your eye
on the prize, which is the chance to sit down following the event in a quality
one-to-one appointment with the most valuable asset your business can
acquire: a quality prospect.
As you work to develop prospects, consider these tips:
 Invite attendees to sign the open house guest book or sign-in sheet.
Many guests may be reluctant, at first, to provide you with the informa-
tion you want and need — which includes their names, addresses, e-mail
addresses, and work, home, and cell phone numbers. However, the
longer you visit with the guests and the more they see that you can pro-
vide them with valuable information, the more willing they are to pro-
vide the information.
 Present your business card to introduce yourself and create a profes-
sional impression. Use the simple act of transferring your card to open
the dialogue door with the prospect. Then, once you get a conversation
going, begin getting the information that you can use as you convert the
guest to a buyer or seller prospect. Use the following tips:
• Ask the prospect a time-frame question. How long have you been
looking? Have you seen anything you’ve liked? How soon are you
hoping to be into a new home? The answers tell you not only about
the prospect’s time frame, but also about her motivation. If a
couple says that they’ve been looking for six months, you know
154
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

that they’re not very motivated buyers or that they’re slow to
make a decision. Either one is not a good answer.
• Ask the prospect a dream question. What are you looking for in
your new home over your present home? What features do you
want in your new home? Describe your perfect new home for me.
By getting the prospects to share what they want, you open up the
dialogue. You also show that you care and are there to help them.
• Don’t be a tree. In other words, don’t be rooted in the kitchen or
family room. Wander the house and stay close to the prospects
without hovering around them. You have a secondary responsibil-
ity to protect the home and the property of the seller. If the open
house guests are in the master bedroom and you are in the
kitchen, they could be in the jewelry box and you wouldn’t even
know it. Make sure that you’re in the general area of your guests at
all times. If the bedrooms are at one end, meander down the hall-
way and ask a question, simultaneously checking on the where-
abouts and interests of your guests.
• Ask the prospect to buy. Before open house guests leave, ask them
to buy the home. If you’ve not yet secured their information, you
have nothing to lose. If they’re not interested, ask them what about
the home causes them to feel it’s not right for them. Doing so
opens up the opportunity for you to share information on other
listings.
Securing the deal by following 
up after the open house
Promptly after the open house, send hand-written thank you notes to every
single person who provided you with contact information. In today’s world of
e-mail and computer-generated correspondence, the power of a hand-written
note is multiplied many times over.
When following up, don’t assume that your event was the only open house
your prospect attended. I guarantee you that this isn’t the case. Realize that
you’re in a competition with other agents, and one way to prevail is to prove
that you’re the one most skilled at lead follow up. Once your hand-written
note is received by your prospects, take the following steps:
 If the prospect requested additional information, or you offered to
provide specific information, send it promptly. But send it separately
from and following your hand-written note.
155
Chapter 8: A Time-Tested Prospecting Tool

 On the afternoon or evening of the day that your hand-written note is
expected to arrive in the mail, place a phone call to the prospect. If
the open house was on a Sunday, your hand-written note should be in
the mail on Monday, and you should make your phone call the next day,
usually on Tuesday. The objective of the call is to book a buyer presenta-
tion appointment in your office. If the note hasn’t arrived when you call,
don’t sweat it. Proceed with your questioning and appointment-setting
focus. Your note will arrive the next day to the surprise of the prospect.
 Later that same week, probably on Thursday or Friday, phone again.
This time, tell the prospect that you’ve found a property that is similar
to what he or she is looking for in a home. Explain that you would like to
meet to evaluate its suitability. Aim to have the meeting take place in
your office. Remember, you’re in competition with other agents.
Whoever gets the prospect into their office first dramatically improves
the odds of acquiring a commission check.
 Repeat the previous step weekly for a few weeks. If you’re unable to
get the prospect into your office within a few weeks, the quality of the
prospect is probably lower than first thought. It’s probably time to cut
loose and move on to more motivated buyers.
When you prospect at open houses, among the leads you acquire are people
who hope to move but never will. I call these hope-to prospects rather than
have-to prospects, and it’s your job as an agent to determine which prospects
fall into which category. That way you can turn your time, attention, and
talent to the needs of the more motivated prospect group.
156
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 
Keeping low-cost contact with “iffy” prospects
Sometimes you want to maintain relationships
with moderately motivated prospects, in hopes
that they choose to work with you when they’re
finally ready to buy or sell.
A good, low-cost way to stay in touch with
these contacts is to send an e-mail version of
your real estate newsletter or some other form
of cyber-correspondence that costs you noth-
ing for delivery or printing. (See Chapter 6 for
advice on creating and distributing your
newsletters.)
Don’t expect a high percentage of these long-
term prospects to convert into listings or sales
based on this contact technique, but your cost
is almost non-existent, so any success is nearly
pure profit. However, be reasonable with your
expectations. If you achieve a 3 percent return,
consider yourself fortunate.

Listing Contracts

 Addressing and overcoming objections
 Bringing presentations to a logical and successful close
P
rospects are potential clients who are interested in considering the ser-
vice options you provide. That’s the good news. The not-so-good news is
that prospects seem to assume that all agents are cut from the same mold; that
all agents do the same things in the same way. They’re truly unaware of the dif-
ferent skills, systems, and philosophies various agents bring to the job — and
the huge difference in results they achieve.
Too many consumers view agents with a commodity mindset. A commodity is
an interchangeable, difficult-to-differentiate offering selected primarily based
on price. Want an example? I was pushing a grocery cart through the produce
section of the grocery store a few days ago, and I put one brand of bananas in
my cart that were priced at 79 cents per pound. In the next aisle, I saw another
brand of bananas for 39 cents a pound. Guess what happened? I took the 70-
cents-per-pound bananas out and put the 39-cents-per-pound bananas into my
cart. I’m not brand-sensitive when it comes to 40 cents a pound. That’s a com-
modity mindset!
Too often, real estate agents are viewed as a bunch of bananas — in other
words, with a commodity mindset. Most agent-listing presentations sound
about the same, so it’s no big surprise that prospects select their agent based
on highest listing price and lowest commission rate. This chapter helps you
set yourself apart. It provides the steps to follow as you convey your differ-
ences, distinctions, and competitive advantages in presentations that are

planned, practiced, rehearsed, and perfected. No more winging it! You’re
about to move into the league of the best, most preferred real estate agents.
Qualifying Your Prospects
The success of a listing presentation is largely determined by what you do
before you even walk through the door. Many agents enter the meeting flying
blind, ill-prepared, and oblivious to the needs, wants, desires, and expecta-
tions of the prospect.
Make this pledge to yourself right now: Before you enter another listing pre-
sentation, qualify your prospects in advance. When scheduling your listing pre-
sentation, ask questions that allow you to obtain important information
about the customer’s desires, time frame, and expectations. Without this
information, you can’t possibly serve the client well.
Many salespeople, especially in real estate sales, think they’ll offend the cus-
tomer if they ask questions. Here’s an analogy that should put your mind at
ease: Imagine you’re sick and you schedule a doctor’s appointment. You
arrive, the doctor enters the examining room, and you look up and say,
“Guess what sickness I have today?” From across the room, the doctor is sup-
posed assess your symptoms, diagnose your ailment, and prescribe a cure
without checking your ears and throat, listening to your lungs and heart, and,
most importantly, asking you questions about what’s wrong and about how
you feel. It sounds ridiculous, but it’s what real estate agents do when they
try to serve clients without first asking questions to qualify their wants,
needs, and expectations.
Without good client information, a listing presentation becomes just another
explanation of your services and service delivery systems. But what if the
prospect sitting in front of you wants to be served differently? Then what?
The customer ultimately determines whether your service is excellent or
poor. Since the customer rules on the quality of service received, the only
way to start the service process is to find out what customers want, instead
of trying to guess their desires and expectations.
Why and how to qualify prospects
You want to qualify prospects for two main reasons:
158
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 To safeguard your time. By qualifying prospects you assess their moti-
vation, desire, need to take action, ability to act, and authority to make
buying or selling decisions. You also assess the odds that the prospect
will result in income-producing activity. The qualifying process increases
your probability of sales success by determining which prospects are
likely to result in commission revenue and which are likely to consume
hours without results.
 To determine their service expectations. What kind of service do they
expect? What buying or selling approach do they follow? Is there a
match between your philosophy and theirs? If there isn’t, can you con-
vince them through persuasion that your approach is better than their
preconceived notion of what and how you should represent their inter-
ests? If not, are you willing to turn down the business? The only way to
address these issues is to figure out what your prospects are thinking
before you make your presentation.
Before you enter a listing presentation, diagnose the situation you’re entering
and the opportunity it presents by examining the prospect’s answers to the
qualifying questions. I recommend you ask the prospect the qualifying ques-
tions over the phone when you’re scheduling the presentation appointment. If
you wait until you’re face to face with the prospect, it’s too late. By then you
want to be offering a tailored presentation, not acquiring baseline information.
159
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts
When the philosophy gap can’t be bridged
Sometimes, a prospective client relationship
just doesn’t feel right. That doesn’t mean the
prospect is a bad client. It means the prospect
is a bad client for you. The only way you’ll know
whether the client is good for you is to do your
qualifying homework by having a listing
appointment with the client.
You should enter the listing appointment with a
clear understanding of your own service
approach and philosophy and use that as the
basis for determining whether the prospective
client is a good match for your business. For
example:
 If your philosophies and attitudes mesh
easily, proceed full steam ahead.
 If you uncover philosophical differences,
work to iron them out by presenting the
benefits of your approach and seeking
agreement to proceed along the path you
know will result in success.
 If you can’t find common ground and the
relationship doesn’t feel right, walk away
from the opportunity. I think you should
walk away from a bad client match at least
one time to see how it feels to take control
of your life and career. Sadly, most agents
are too scared to do this. Instead they plow
ahead through a nightmarish situation with
toxic clients.

Focus your qualifying questions around the following four topics:
 Motivation and time frame: Ask questions that allow you to gauge how
excited the prospect is to buy or sell, and in what time frame they’re
hoping for. Sample questions include:
• Where are you hoping to move?
• How soon do you need to be there?
• Tell me about your ideal time frame. When do you want this move
to happen?
• Is there anything that would cause you not to make this move?
 Experience: A prospect’s view of the real estate profession is filtered
through personal previous experience and experiences related by
friends and family members. The following questions help you under-
stand your prospect’s real estate background and preconceptions:
• How many properties have you sold in the past?
• When was your last sales experience?
• What was your experience like with that sale?
• How did you select the agent you worked with?
• What did you like best and least about what that agent did?
 Pricing: Asking questions about money will help you gauge the
prospect’s motivation. They’ll also help you determine whether the
prospect is realistic about current real estate values and whether he is
ready to sell or is just fishing for a price. Listen carefully to the answers
to the following two questions:
• How much do you want to list your home for tonight?
• If a buyer came in today, what would you consider to be an accept-
able offer for your home?
Here’s an old real estate sales truth: The higher the list price, the lower
the motivation; the lower the list price, the higher the motivation.
 Service expectations: Learning your prospect’s service expectations is
absolutely essential to establishing a good working relationship, but I’ll
warn you that when you begin to ask the service-related questions you’ll
likely hear dead silence. Your prospect has probably never met a service
provider concerned enough to ask what the customer wants, values, and
expects. As a result, you may have to probe and ask follow-up questions
160
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

to help the prospect open up and enter into the conversation. The 
following are some sample questions to help figure out what you’re
prospect is looking for:
• What do you expect from the real estate agent you choose to 
work with?
• What are the top three things you’re looking for from an agent?
• What would it take for you to be confident that my service will
meet your requirements?
Following your phone interview or listings appointment, use the answers to
questions in each of the above four categories as you compile a qualifying
questionnaire on the prospect. See Figure 9-1 for a good format to follow.
Checking your prospect’s “DNA”
Based on your qualifying efforts, determine the likelihood that your prospect
will convert into a good client for your business by conducting a “DNA”
analysis. This involves measuring the prospect’s level of desire, need to take
action, and ability and authority to make a purchase or selling decision.
D for desire
Desire, or motivation, is the strongest indicator of a successful business 
outcome. A prospect’s burning desire can overcome all other deficiencies,
including a lack of financial capacity or purchase ability.
Desire is not the same as interest. Anyone can have interest. Interest doesn’t
reflect intent, and it doesn’t indicate a high probability of action. If a prospect
simply says, “I have an interest in selling,” probe deeper to see if the prospect
actually has a real desire to sell, or is just interested in possibly selling. I’ve
found that many “interested” shoppers are looking for something that doesn’t
exist. I’ve heard interested prospects basically say, “If you can get me $50,000
above market value for my house and you can find one I can buy at $75,000
below market value, I’ll list my home with you.” Get real! The truth is, if I
could find a property for $75,000 below market I wouldn’t sell it to him; I’d
buy it myself and so should you!
N for need
A need is a specific and identifiable problem that your service can help a
prospect fulfill.

Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Many prospect’s needs stem from lifestyle changes that prompt environmen-
tal changes. A family expecting another child needs a larger home. Empty
nesters tired of yardwork and home upkeep want to move to a maintenance-
free condo. A divorce requires one household to become two households,
sometimes forcing a home sale and several purchases in the aftermath. The
need to buy or sell based on environmental changes such as these prompt
the majority of real estate transactions each year.
One of the reasons I worked expired listings was because the owner’s level of
need was so apparent. After being stuck with an unsold home for months or
even years, the seller’s need to find an agent who could solve the problem
was pretty clear. My job was merely to convince the seller that by working
with me her problem would be solved and that I would deliver a different and
positive outcome.
A for ability and authority
Clients need both ability and authority to conduct a real estate transaction.
Ability relates to the financial capacity of your prospects. Do they have the
financial stability to sell their current home and buy the one of their dreams?
Do they have enough equity in their current home? If not, can they borrow a
larger sum to buy the one they want, or do they have access to additional
funds to achieve their goal?
Authority means the prospect has the power to make the decision — the
power to say yes or no to the deal. Ask if the prospect is working with the
ultimate decision-maker or decision-makers, or if someone else is also

The power of desire
The summer before my junior year in college I
painted houses to earn money for my tuition,
books, and room and board. When I started
work on the last house of the summer, I learned
that the owner was selling a 1976 BMW 2002. I
wanted that car, even though buying it would
take all my summer earnings and college sav-
ings. My parents tried to counsel me away from
this foolish idea. My ability to buy was limited
due to money, but my desire was greater than
my lack of ability. I ended up borrowing the
money for the car and still covering my college
costs. This creative ingenuity didn’t please my
parents at all. Looking back, it wasn’t one of the
smarter decisions I have made in the last 25
years. But it did teach me a lesson about the
power of desire or motivation to compensate for
all other shortcomings.

involved. Also find out if the prospects will decide autonomously or if they
will they seek the guidance or advice of others as they make their decision.
Agents make a huge mistake when they make listing presentations to a
prospect whose spouse or significant other isn’t in attendance. It doesn’t
matter whether both names are on the title. In our family, we own properties
that show only my wife’s name on the title, and others that show only mine.
This is purely an estate-planning move on our part. If we decided to sell, I
guarantee that our input would be equal in decisions about pricing and about
who should represent our interest in the sale.
Fundamentals for Presenting Listings 
to Qualified Prospects
A quality listing presentation involves considerable planning, careful
research and analysis (see Chapter 10 for details on performing a competitive
market analysis), and highly developed presentation and sales skills. By
taking these measures, you derive maximum impact from the little time you
have to present yourself and your recommendations, close the deal, and
obtain signatures on a listing agreement.
This section guides you as you prepare a presentation that displays all of
your sales skills and abilities and helps you win your prospects’ confidence
so that you can secure their listing.
Know the purpose of your presentation
Be crystal-clear on this point: The objective of a listing presentation is to
secure a signed listing agreement before the meeting ends. It’s not to pave
the way for a be-back listing, where you plan to return at a later date to handle
paperwork and secure final prospect approval. Your purpose is to make your
case, close the deal, and get ink on the paper right then and there while
you’re face to face with your prospects. If you don’t, I guarantee that the
odds of securing the listing start to swing away from you.
If you let even a few days or weeks slip by, your prospects will have a difficult
time separating your presentation from those of the other agents they met in
the meantime. And the moment they lose sight of your distinguishing attrib-
utes they’ll revert to a commodity mindset, focusing on price and selecting an
agent based on who offered the lowest commission or the highest list price.
164
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

I’ve personally made more than a thousand listing presentations, and I’ve
coached and listened to the presentations of hundreds of other agents.
Because of these experiences, I’m totally convinced that a quality listing pre-
sentation can, and must, result in a signed contract at the presentation.
Here are two reasons you need to have the listing signed during the 
presentation:
 The moment you leave the appointment, anything can happen. A
buyer could appear out of nowhere, knocking on your prospect’s door
with a direct offer. An agent who interviewed your prospect a few days
ago could be desperate enough to call with an offer to cut their fee by
another percent. At church or at chamber of commerce or Rotary meet-
ings your prospect could meet another agent. Or, after a few days or
weeks she may begin to confuse you with a different agent whose pre-
sentation she didn’t like at all. The list of possible scenarios goes on and
on. The only thing you know for sure is that if you don’t get the signed
listing at the appointment, you leave it up for grabs.
 You need to feel the win. The win in the listing game is when the con-
tract is signed. Don’t underestimate the power of that personal victory.
Selling involves the risk of rejection. If it didn’t involve risk, it would be
called order taking and you wouldn’t be paid so well because it would be
so easy. A listing presentation gives you the chance to go for the win, per-
fect your close, and attain the victory. Give yourself the satisfaction and
adrenaline rush of walking out of the home with a signed contract. Your
drive home will be the shortest ever known. However, if you don’t get the
contract signed, it will be the longest few minutes you’ve ever endured.
Make your presentation 
useful and interesting
Most agent presentations put sellers to sleep, mainly because most presenta-
tions lack interest, usefulness, and structure.
The presentation advice in the preceding section provides all you need to
know to overcome the structure and usefulness issues. To increase the inter-
est quotient, follow this advice:
 Share market knowledge. Become a student of the local marketplace
and share meaningful statistics. Also, track trends in the national mar-
ketplace, both to enlighten your prospects and to distinguish yourself as
a well-read, well-connected, and well-informed agent.
165
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

 Ask questions. Listen in on typical listing presentations, and you’ll hear
the agent talking 80 percent of the time, with the prospect hardly getting
a word in edgewise. I guarantee you that the seller finds that monologue
uninteresting.
 Watch the clock. Don’t let your presentation run too long and don’t save
the information the seller most wants to receive until the very end. If
you put your price recommendation at the very end of a 90-minute pre-
sentation during which you did 80 percent of the talking, well you can
pretty well predict that your seller will be tuned out.
What the prospect has to say is more important than what you have to
say. Great salespeople do less than 25 percent of the talking. You already
know all that you need to know about what you’re thinking. You need to
figure out what your prospects think, know, and desire so you can match
your service to their wants and needs.
Keep it short and sweet
Let’s get right to the point: A 90-minute presentation is neither short nor sweet.
What in the world an agent finds to talk about for 90 minutes I have no idea, but
I do know for sure that sellers don’t want to sit through a 90-minute appoint-
ment, and they most certainly don’t want to listen to an agent for that long.
Within the first few minutes of the appointment, inform your sellers that your
listing presentation will take no more than 45 minutes. Based on my own expe-
rience, I can tell you that more than half of the sellers will thank you when you
tell them that your presentation will be brief. Many times, I’ve had clients
thank me again when I was walking out the door with their signed contract,
and while they do, I share their appreciation that I wasn’t there all night!
An effective, brief presentation results from a proper structure and a clear
presentation plan, and from knowing what to say and how to say it.
Many agents translate the terms “structure” and “plan” to mean a canned 
presentation. They say, “I don’t want to sound mechanical and scripted.”
However, people sound mechanical and scripted because of lack of practice,
not because they have a pattern or process to follow. In fact, most people
expect professional service providers to follow plans or patterns. For exam-
ple, when I board a plane you can bet that I want the pilot to follow a canned
preflight checklist, landing checklist, flight plan, and so on. I’m not working to
“can” anyone, but the necessity to plan your presentation is essential. Every
time you present, you need to have a framework that you’re comfortable with
and that allows you to deliver key facts, findings, and segments by using key
166
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

phrases and dialogues. While I don’t suggest canned presentations, I would
rather an agent err on the side of canned than to just wing it.
The upcoming section, “Giving a Quality Presentation: A Four-Phase Formula,”
provides the structure you should follow as you work to prepare a great pre-
sentation. Additionally, follow this advice:
 Know your prospects. If you aren’t completely clear on your prospects’
interests and needs, flip back to the first pages of this chapter. One of
the reasons I constructed the opening section on qualifying prospects so
meticulously is because acquiring prospect knowledge is truly the key to
a good presentation. You absolutely have to secure the right information
before going into the appointment.
 Set a goal to keep your presentation to 45 minutes or less. Look at
every piece of sales material you plan to present and put it to the test:
Does it demonstrate clear benefits to the seller? Does it truly need to 
be used? Will the seller understand it? Does it create differentiation
between you and the other agents? As the saying goes, “When in doubt,
leave it out.”
 Limit the number of PowerPoint slides or color presentation binder
pages that you use because they eat up your presentation time and
your chance to talk directly with the sellers. Typically, each page in
your presentation — whether it’s on a computer screen or on paper —
represents two minutes of presentation time between turning the pages,
talking about them, emphasizing key points, and asking for questions to
confirm your prospect’s understanding. Do the math: 30 pages times two
minutes a piece eats up an hour, putting you well over your time limit.
And that’s before you even get to the contract!
Focus on four keys to a great delivery
One study after another has shown that your body language and tonality
account for over 90 percent of your presentation’s effectiveness. What you
actually say accounts for less than 10 percent of the delivery. If you’re scram-
bling to find the right words, as most salespeople are, you’re spending your
energy in inverse proportion to what impacts your effectiveness.
The solution is to plan what you’re going to say beforehand, so that during
the presentation you can focus on language, tonality, and the following four
items, which help provide a great delivery.
167
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

Conviction
Webster defines conviction as a fixed or firm belief. I’d add that nothing is
more compelling than conviction because it shows your client the level of
passion in your beliefs.
Your belief that you can get the job done draws the client to you. Your belief
in the value of his home or how his home should be sold earns his trust. Your
firm belief about where the marketplace is headed, backed by statistics that
prove your point, sells you and your recommendations.
Before you go face to face with sellers, determine the three things that you
want to express with absolute conviction. If your sellers share your views,
(you’ll know based on your prospect qualifying work) that’s a bonus. If their
views are the opposite of yours, be doubly persuasive and resolute so that
you can convince them to adopt your point of your view and gain their signa-
ture on the listing contract.
In my presentations, I expressed my conviction that sales skills were an
essential skill that I had that most agents didn’t. I also was passionate about
my conviction that open houses didn’t sell homes. I told my sellers that I
wouldn’t inconvenience them with open houses like most agents would.
Finally, I told them that an agent with high sales numbers in units sold was a
more skilled agent than one with a high sales volume because they had a
higher average sales price. 
Enthusiasm
Enthusiasm sells in spades. People want to work with those who are enthusi-
astic about their home and the market. If the market is tough, you have to be
frank; you can’t just hide market realities. But you can still be enthusiastic
and show that you’re excited about the opportunity to “beat the odds” of the
marketplace.
Your listing presentation will be more interesting if you’re enthusiastic about
your career, your business, their home, and the sellers as people. Follow the
old sales adage: “Enthusiasm is to selling as yeast is to bread. It makes the
dough rise!”
Confidence
I believe that confidence was the secret edge in my early sales career. Even
when I was new to the game, I was confident that I was the best agent for the
seller. This confidence was the result of a deeply grooved expectation of vic-
tory that came from my participation in athletics.
168
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Where have you experienced victories? Tap into those past experiences as
you pump up your confidence in preparation for prospect presentations.
If you lack confidence, determine what you need to do to establish belief in
yourself and your ability to achieve success. What activities would help
increase your confidence? What skills do you need to master to dramatically
affect your confidence? What one thing, if you did it with excellence, would
change your self-confidence?
The great success motivator Napoleon Hill says, “What the mind can con-
ceive and believe, it can achieve.” I saw evidence of this truth a few years ago
working with a great agent in North Carolina. She didn’t have confidence in
herself, nor did she think she was a great agent. Even when she closed 100
units a year, she was still self-sabotaging her success. I asked her to write out
her standard of a great agent. She did so with great and specific clarity. Six
months later she had met the standard to a tee, but was still in self-sabotage
mode. Fortunately, I’d saved her written document and presented it to her as
proof of her success. Since that day, she has believed in herself and has never
looked back.
Assertiveness
Agents don’t want to come off as pushy or aggressive in their sales approach,
and by mistake they shy away from assertiveness as well.
A great salesperson is a person who convinces someone to do something
that is beneficial to him or her or who convinces that person to do it faster.
Going for the close is not pushy. It’s assertive. As a real estate agent, your job
is to persuade prospects that you have the best service, the best value, and
the highest probability for their success and to convince them to sign up for
the benefits you provide, now!
One of the easiest ways to exert your assertiveness is to tell the prospect it’s
coming. Early in the presentation say something such as, “At the end of my
presentation tonight, provided we’re all in agreement, we’ll finalize the paper-
work so I can begin to work for you right away.” This bit of foreshadowing
may come in useful should you encounter resistance at the time of the close.
If you do encounter resistance you can use one of these scripts:
“This should be no surprise. I told you I would ask for your business. You
want me to follow through on what I commit to you, don’t you?”
“I’m proving to you right now that I follow through, right?”
“Listen, Mr. and Mrs. Seller, homes are sold, not bought. The reason conver-
sion of leads is so low is because many agents lack assertiveness with the
buyer. So my question is: Do you want an agent that you know for sure will
169
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

ask every buyer to buy or an agent you hope will do that? Which gives you
more comfort?”
Being assertive in selling, especially real estate selling, is a good thing.
Stay in control
Agents lose control of the listing presentation when they allow the seller’s
agenda to take over the discussion. I have listened to agents who have lost
control to the seller in the first five minutes. The problem for most agents is
that once they lose control they don’t have the skill to wrestle it back.
The seller’s agenda is simple: He wants to know what his home is worth, what
you do to sell it, and what you charge for your service. And for sure he wants
to know what he’ll put in his pockets when the deal is done. If you allow the
seller to take control and force you to orient your presentation to the order
of his interests, I guarantee you won’t walk out with the listing.
If you talk about the price of the home and your fee structure before you’ve
built trust, credibility, and value for your service, you’ll lose every time. Don’t
ever follow the seller’s agenda! Flip to Chapter 15 for more information on
how to build trust and keep clients for life.
Setting the agenda early on
The most powerful technique for an effective presentation is to have an
actual order or agenda to follow. I would further suggest that you create it
according to the presentation guidelines earlier in this chapter. After you
determine your agenda, type it out so you can hand it to the seller, saying
something like the following:
“Ms. Seller, I have found this presentation order to be most effective for my
clients like you. It allows me to present to you the important facts, market-
place strategies, and benefits you receive as my clients. In addition, there
will be plenty of time to answer all your questions so you are completely
comfortable with your decision. Would it be all right with you if we follow
this agenda for our meeting?”
Keeping on track
Your agenda might look like this:
1. Review agenda for the meeting
2. Visual inspection of the property
170
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

At this point, you simply need to ask the seller if they would show you
around their home. They’ll usually be delighted to show you all the
nooks and crannies that the home has. Often along the way you’ll find
sellers who stop to tell you what they think are the selling features of
their home.
3. Discuss the client’s goals, needs, and expectations of me
4. Discuss my professional credentials
5. Determine listing price
6. Complete the paperwork so I can begin serving the client
The last item needs to be on your agenda. It alerts the clients in advance of
how you’re going to close. In fact, etch all six items in stone — don’t move or
rearrange them. You have to build trust, credibility, and value in that order or
you’ll lose.
When the seller brings up a point that would cause you to abandon your pre-
sentation plan, pick up the agenda sheet and ask:
“Would it be all right to discuss that when we get to this point in the 
presentation?”
Giving a Quality Presentation: 
A Four-Phase Formula
A quality presentation follows these four phases: You begin by building trust
and then you move into a demonstration of the benefits and advantages that
you bring to the prospects, present your pricing recommendation and ration-
ale, and move to close the deal by presenting a listing agreement and getting
the prospects to sign on the proverbial dotted line.
The appointment itself takes under an hour. The preparation involves a good
deal more. The upcoming sections guide you through the preparations that
go into each segment of the presentation.
Getting off to a good start
Paving the way for a good listing presentation involves only three steps, but
you can’t afford to skip a single one:
171
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

1. Make sure all decision-makers are present.
This first step is more like an overarching rule. If one of the decision-
makers can’t attend because an emergency arose, reschedule for
another time. If a decision-maker is absent, you’ll have to rely on the
other party to relay your presentation, complete with paraphrasing, mis-
interpretations, abbreviated points, and omissions. Not a good option
for you.
2. Based on your pre-appointment interview, enter the meeting with a
presentation that incorporates your prospect’s needs, desires, and
expectations.
3. Open the presentation by building trust with your prospects.
Forget about finding common ground or seeking to establish rapport by
talking about your common interest in fishing, hunting, water skiing, or
horses. Prospects see right through this disingenuous effort to establish
a pseudofriendship. They’re looking for business associates. So, get to
the point.
To build trust, summarize what the prospects have told you about their
values, their goals for this move, the motivations behind the move, and
what they hope to accomplish. Refer them to your qualifying questions
and reconfirm the answers they shared with you. Confirm that you’ve
correctly understood their input, and communicate that what is impor-
tant to them is also important to you.
This introductory and trust-building segment at the beginning of your presen-
tation should take 10 to 15 minutes, at the most.
The success or failure of your presentation can usually be traced back to this
initial segment. If prospects don’t feel that you understand and relate to their
needs, wants, and desires, they’ll tune you out after just the first few minutes,
which is long before you get to the part where you tell them how great you
and your company are!
Setting yourself apart from 
the real estate agent pack
In this part of the presentation, you demonstrate the benefits and advantages
prospects can count on when they sign with you. You demonstrate these ben-
efits by doing the following:
172
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Selling benefits instead of features
 Proving your competitive edge
 Presenting the strongest statistics to your advantage
This segment of your presentation should be no more than eight to twelve
minutes of your presentation. If it takes longer than that, you’re talking too
much about you and your services. The client will get bored before you begin
the value discussion.
Most agents make a big mistake by either omitting this segment or using it to
present features of their business rather than benefits derived by clients.
Many agents don’t realize the difference between features and benefits.
Examples of features are air conditioning in a home or anti-lock brakes on a
car. The benefits of air conditioning include comfort, coolness, and ease of
sleep at night. The benefits of anti-lock brakes are safety, protection, and
quicker stopping.
Sell benefits, not features
The vast majority of salespeople, especially real estate agents, sell features
instead of benefits. Look at image ads for agents or listen to listing presenta-
tions and all you’ll see and hear are features:
 I sold 150 homes last year.
 I’ve been in the business for 20 years.
 I work for the #1 company in the marketplace.
 I’m a member of the million-dollar club.
 I put my clients first.
 I’m honest and have integrity.
 Blah, blah, blah!
In these kinds of feature lineups, prospects don’t hear anything about what’s in
it for them — they don’t hear what advantages they reap as a result of the
agent’s attributes. As a result, they tune out much of the presentation, and the
rest sounds just like what they heard from other agents. No wonder clients
revert to the tendency of making decisions based on list price and commission.
If you want prospects to listen and care, don’t talk about yourself. Instead,
talk about what you offer them. Turn every feature of your business into a
benefit for the customer. For example, “I sold 150 homes last year” might
become “I sold 150 homes last year and what really matters to you was that
173
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

nearly 80 percent were on the market for far fewer days than the regional
average. This reduction in time on the market reduced the number of home
payments that my sellers made on homes they no longer wanted to own.” See
the difference?
Prove your competitive edge
Compare your performance against regional averages to prove your competi-
tive edge. By citing industry averages, you clearly position yourself. You also
give yourself the opportunity to demonstrate your superb market knowledge,
which indirectly builds your reputation and directly benefits your clients. For
help honing your market knowledge, go back to Chapter 4 where you find
advice on collecting and analyzing regional facts and figures and presenting
your findings.
As you prepare to present your distinct edge, ask yourself:
 What makes me different?
 Why should someone hire me?
 What are my strengths?
 How do my distinct attributes result in unique client benefits?
Also, take time to assess weaknesses in your service and then find ways to
compensate for your shortcomings. For instance, if your stats are weak, pre-
sent the benefits your client derives from your company’s strong perfor-
mance record. Or, if your time in the real estate field is short, present how the
experience gained in your pre-real estate career benefits your clients. For an
idea of how it works, look at these two examples of scripts that give you a
positive spin:
“One of your needs as a seller is an agent who understands how to create a
successful transaction and satisfied client. While I don’t have ten years expe-
rience in the real estate business, I am not new to our mutual goal — your
satisfaction. One of the reasons I chose to work with ____ real estate com-
pany is because of their long and widely recognized success helping families
like yours to achieve their goals and dreams. Our firm has led the region in
successful transactions for XX years, and we bring that capability to your
transaction.”
“One of your needs as a seller is an agent who understands how to create a
successful transaction and satisfied client. While I don’t have ten years expe-
rience in the real estate business, I’m very accomplished at achieving our
mutual goal — your satisfaction. In my previous career, I served over _____
clients with a customer satisfaction rate of well over ___%.”
174
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Use the power of your strongest statistics
To set myself apart from other agents, during every presentation I always
pulled out the power of my “Big 3” — the three key statistics that demon-
strated my personal success and my company’s success in the marketplace.
Here’s the approach I used:
1. Start by acknowledging what the prospect already knows: Agents all
provide similar service. I’d say: “Every agent will put your home into
the MLS.” (In today’s environment, I might say, “All agents advertise
homes on personal and company Web sites.”) Then I’d add, “If those tac-
tics were all it took to achieve success, then every agent would sell hun-
dreds of homes. And, over 98 percent of listings would turn into closed
deals, rather than the board average of 68 percent.” With this introduc-
tion, I basically admit that agents all do basically the same thing, yet
they achieve vastly different results.
2. Then set yourself apart. I’d say something like, “Do you want to hear
what really creates the difference for my sellers compared to clients of
other agents? It’s the power of the Big 3: Sales skills, conversion ability,
and conversion of leads to clients.” Since my performance in those three
areas was significantly better than the board’s average, I knew I was cre-
ating a sustainable, competitive advantage over the competition.
3. Share a success story that shows the benefit your Big 3 advantages
deliver. In my case, I’d share that the average agent converts fewer than
2 percent of leads into clients. I’d then present the volume of leads my
business and company generate and the corresponding conversion rates
we achieve. However, I never quit at that point, since all it did was pre-
sent a feature of our service. I had to show the prospects how this fea-
ture benefits them.
4. Show how your success story translates to client benefits. I’d show
prospects how more leads results in greater exposure for each client’s
home. I’d explain that because my team and I converted leads at 16 per-
cent, as opposed to the 2 percent average, my clients have a higher
probability of selling their homes. I proved the point by showing that I
sold 150 homes a year and that the average agent sold only four. These
agents sell so few largely because the average agent develops far fewer
clients to work with. While the average agent sells 9 percent of her own
listings, our firm sold over 32 percent of our own listings.
I would tell my clients that my track record resulted in higher probabil-
ity of sale, higher sales prices, and less hassle for the seller working with
me. To emphasize the point, I’d present this logic:
175
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

Increased clients = Increased showings
Increased showings = Increased competition for the sellers’ home
Increased competition = Higher probability of sale or higher sale
price, or both
As a newer agent, you may not be able to show your own strong numbers,
but you can present your company’s Big 3 instead. For instance, you may
focus on the fact that your company sells more units than its competitors,
that your company has more agents to create more exposure, and that your
company has high market share, which leads to increased ad and sales calls.
Then present this logic:
 Increased exposure for your client = Higher quality and increased
number of leads
 Increased number and quality of leads = Increased showings
 Increased showings = Higher probability of sale or higher sale price, or
both
Gaining confirmation
Once you’ve conveyed your benefits to the seller, pause to confirm that they
understand and agree with the points you’ve made. Do this through a confir-
mation close or trial close, using the following scripts as a guide:
“Do you see how our company delivers the benefit of greater exposure and
higher probability of sale for our clients? Is that what you want?”
“Do you see why we have such a large market share, and does it make
sense how our market dominance benefits you? Do you want that type of
edge in the marketplace?”
Presenting prices
The moment you receive confirmation that the prospect understands the
unique benefits you deliver, move into the pricing segment of your presentation,
during which you share your findings regarding the value of their property.
This part of the presentation should take only about 20 percent of the meet-
ing time. You make your clear recommendation, present the strong, concise
rationale behind it, and seek the prospect’s agreement. Keep it short by fol-
lowing this advice:
176
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

 Keep it simple when telling the prospect the truth about the value of
his home.
I’m a firm advocate for giving the prospect a single price rather than pro-
viding a range. If you’re a little unsure, you can give him a range, but
make sure it’s a very tight range — less than a $50,000 variance.
I suggest staying away from a range because invariably, if you use a
range as many agents do, the seller will select the price in the highest
part of the range, or even above it. When this happens, you risk having a
property that is overpriced because you weren’t strong enough to tell
the seller the truth. You then have to invest the next few weeks, and in
some cases months, getting the home down to a price that will allow it
to sell.
 After presenting your price recommendation and your case for its
value, ask the prospect if he understands why his home is worth the
amount you’ve recommended. Asking this question is the surest way to
discover whether your prospects agree with your number.
An alternate tactic is to prepare a full net-proceeds sheet, which shows
the list price minus all closing costs. Walk him through each cost of clos-
ing based on the price you suggest. Then when you get to the bottom
line — the estimate of how many dollars will go into his pocket — ask,
“Is this enough to get you where you want to go?”
 Proceed to the close based on the answer you receive. Sometimes a
prospect will agree with your recommendation, sometimes he won’t, and
sometimes he’ll want to negotiate the number.
If he agrees, the gate is open for you to go for the close and get his signa-
ture on the listing agreement.
If he says no or wants to negotiate, you have to find out how far apart
you are. Ask him what he’ll do if he can’t get the extra money he’s
hoping for. Why does he feel your number falls short? Is his price goal
based on the down payment requirement on the next home he’s buying,
or on his desire to obtain an 80 percent loan-to-value mortgage in order
to avoid mortgage insurance? You can only work on solutions if you
know your prospect’s frame of reference, financial objectives, and the
reasons behind his pricing needs. Keep in mind that what the seller
needs or expects out of the sale has nothing to do with what the prop-
erty is worth.
If you don’t gain agreement on price, you have nothing more to talk
about during the listing appointment. There’s no point in going further
unless you can arrive at a meeting of minds on price.
177
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

Going for the close
As soon as you have agreement on price, go for the close and get a signed
contract.
You may be thinking, “When do I tell the seller about the marketing plan?”
You don’t. It’s immaterial to the discussion. The listing presentation is about
the results that you achieve, not how you achieve them. If your key statistics
and the distinguishing benefits of doing business with you aren’t strong
enough, no marketing plan will fill the gap.
Prove that you and your company are the best. Convince the seller of her
home’s value. Know her expectations of service and results and guarantee
that you’ll meet and exceed them. Then close the contract.
Closing is the natural ending to a great presentation.
Dealing with Sales Objections
Sales objections are part of selling. For most people in sales, objections pre-
sent an immovable object in the road to your success. Real estate agents
often freeze when presented with a sales objection. They don’t know what to
do or say in the face of this perceived danger.
Let me share with you a radical concept: Sales objections are actually good.
Now that I’ve blown your circuits, let me explain. You won’t sell anything sig-
nificant without sales objections. Sales objections indicate an elevated level
of interest, desire, or motivation to buy what you’re offering. Objections are
merely a request for more information.
The prospect is saying, “I need more information. If I like the information you
give me, I will do business with you.” What could be better than that?
Delaying objections
One of the best ways to delay sales objections is to refer back to your
approved agenda, saying:
“Mr. and Mrs. Seller, would it be all right if I answered your concern when
we get to item number 5 on our agenda? That’s where we discuss _____.”
178
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

More than 40 percent of the time, the seller won’t bring the sales objection
up again. You handled the sales objection by delaying its arrival.
Using your agenda to delay objections is particularly important when the
concern deals with the home price or the cost of your service. Don’t ever
respond to pricing concerns until you have determined the sellers’ wants,
needs, and expectations and have established the value for your service.
Handling objections in four easy steps
Objections are inevitable, and if you can’t delay them, be ready to deal with
them by following this four-step system.
1. Pause
When an objection arises, hear the client out completely and then pause.
Pause to collect your thoughts and, for many salespeople, to lower what
might feel like rising blood pressure. Pause to ensure that you heard the
objection completely. Don’t try to cut the person off. I’ve watched salespeo-
ple interrupt, as if they’re hoping to stuff the words back into the client’s
mouth before they’re even out. This is the biggest mistake you can make. It
demonstrates rudeness and insensitivity.
2. Acknowledge concerns
After hearing the objection and pausing to consider it, acknowledge the con-
cern. This confirms that you understand what the client said, and it also
gives you a few moments to consider and prepare your response.
Nothing in the previous paragraph advises you to agree with the client. You
can acknowledge the concern and thank the client for bringing it up without
saying that it’s correct.
You can acknowledge the client by using any of these phrases:
“I understand your concern in this area.”
“That’s a really terrific question. I’m glad you asked it.”
“I can see where that might cause you concern.”
One of my favorite techniques is to follow acknowledgement of a concern
with a question or comment that probes for more information. The following
responses give you an opportunity to find out more while also buying a few
moments to develop a response:
179
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

“I understand your concern in this area. Why do you feel that way?”
“I can see where that might cause you concern. Tell me more.”
3. Isolate concerns
By now you might be ready to pounce on the objection with your best
answers. Hold off, if you can, while you isolate the concern. Isolation at its
fundamental level, asks: “If it weren’t for this concern, we would be working
together, right?”
By isolating the objection, you cause the prospects to lay all their concerns
on the table. Through this one step you figure out everything that is standing
between you and a signed listing contract.
Use any of these isolation scripts as you help sellers get their concerns out
into the open:
“Is that the only concern that holds you back from moving forward with me?”
“Suppose we could find a satisfactory solution to this important concern of
yours. Would you give me the go-ahead?”
“If this problem didn’t exist, would you be ready to proceed right now?”
By isolating the concern, you find out exactly what you’re up against. You
might surface another objection in the process — which is why many agents
shrink away from this step — but you would have heard it later anyway.
4. Respond with confidence
By now you’ve heard the objection, paused, acknowledged, and isolated. Now
is the time to respond.
The most commonly stated objections center around agent commission,
price of the home, length of the listing term, and the need for extra time to
make the listing decision. More than 80 percent of the objections you’ll hear
over the course of your career stem from these key concerns, so prepare
yourself by outlining and mastering your responses that convince the sellers
you’re able to handle the concern more effectively than other agents.
Ask your broker for scripts that the company recommends you use to handle
sales objections. If they don’t have them, make an investment in your career
and buy them from an expert.
180
Part II: Prospecting for Buyers and Sellers 

Asking for the Order
After you have overcome seller concerns or objections, ask for the order. In
sales terms, this means ask the prospects to do business with you.
At the end of a presentation, a typical salesperson’s close is something like,
“Well, what do you think?” It’s obvious to me why the typical salesperson
sells very little. Winding up with a question like, “What do you think?” is
hardly asking for the order or closing.
Closing is making a definitive statement about your conviction that you’re the
right person for the job and that the client should take action now. A good
closing statement goes like this:
“Mr. Seller, based on your goals, needs, and expectations, I’m confidant that
I’m the right person to handle the sale for you. Let’s get started now!”
As you say, “Let’s get started,” you slide the listing agreement in front of
them. Hand them the pen to sign with and smile. Most importantly, shut up!
Don’t utter a word. You want them to think and you want to let the moment of
anticipation resonate.
Bringing the Presentation 
to a Natural Conclusion
Following any major sales transaction, people feel a bit of uncertainty, a feeling
of, “What did I just do?” Preempt fear by addressing and controlling concerns.
Before you leave the meeting, recap what steps will happen next and what
you’ll be doing for your clients in the next 24 to 48 hours. Then reassure them
that they made a great decision. Tell them that you look forward to serving
them and working with them, that the goals they set will be achieved, and
that they selected the right agent for the job.
If you don’t get the contract signed at the appointment, it now comes down
to follow-up after the presentation. Be sure to inquire about the time frame of
their decision before you leave.
181
Chapter 9: Presenting and Closing Listing Contracts

Send a handwritten thank-you note the next day (at the very latest). Call 
them the day after your presentation and ask them if they need any additional
information from you to help with the decision. Ask them if you’re still in the
running for their business. Is there anything that would swing the decision in
your favor? The answer to this question may bring up your commission, but
you should try to avoid that topic. If you can get a second appointment to
meet face to face with them in the next 24 to 48 hours, you stand a better
chance of securing the listing.

O
ne of your primary jobs as a real estate agent is to assess the value of
property for your clients. Arriving at an ideal price is hardly the result
of guesswork. Skilled agents recommend purchase or sales prices only after a
carefully considered review of the property’s condition, location, structure,
amenities, and functionality. This review is tempered by the realities of
regional competition and the economic environment.
The best agents follow a structured process as they evaluate properties and
render pricing opinions, systematically balancing the features and benefits of
the home against the attributes of competing homes, recently closed homes,
homes that have been sold and are pending, and currently for sale homes.
This chapter guides you through the field of real estate evaluation and helps
you establish your own pricing approach and strategy.
Examining Pricing Approaches
The real estate world relies on three basic approaches to property valuation:
 Appraisal: The vast majority of prospective property purchasers seek
financing from a bank or financial institution. These financial entities
require an appraisal in order to certify the value of the property and to
ensure that the funds being lent cover a certain percentage of the real
value of the property as assessed by an impartial third party (and not a

percentage of some pie-in-the-sky figure set by an aggressive seller or
agent). An appraisal analyzes and documents the condition and attrib-
utes of a property, and analyzes its value through a process that usually
involves comparing the property with sales of comparable properties in
the market area.
Appraisers arrive at a home’s value by issuing deductions and credits
for features the home either has or doesn’t have when compared to simi-
lar properties in the market area. For example, if the subject home has a
fireplace and comparable homes don’t, the home’s value is bumped up.
Investigate the values an appraiser is likely to either credit or debit to a
property in your area based on the amenities it has or doesn’t have. Talk
with appraisers in your area, and find out how they judge the worth of a
fireplace, an extra bedroom, hardwood floors, an extra-large lot, an extra
garage, upgraded finish work, landscaping, a sprinkler system, a deck, a
hot tub, a spa bathtub, and other amenities or features. Because values
vary greatly from one market area to another, compile a list of the items
that affect pricing in your area along with the credits or debits that
accompany each entry. This information arms you with your own valua-
tion resource and allows you to offer valuable counsel to your buyers
and sellers.
 Broker price opinion (BPO): A BPO is a property value assessment
increasingly required by relocation companies that help employees trans-
fer to new communities. Each relocation company has its own BPO form
and process to complete, but nearly all aim to achieve the same objec-
tive: to understand the value of the employee’s currently owned prop-
erty, the likely sales time frame, and the probability of a sale at a certain
price. Based on the BPO, an employer can craft a moving package offer
that’s based on a sound value opinion. The last thing an employer wants
is to offer a transferring employee an unreasonably optimistic buyout
offer that leaves the company saddled with an overpriced home.
 Competitive market analysis (CMA): Competitive market analyses are
fundamental to all professionally listed real estate deals. Agents skilled
in conducting CMAs stand head-and-shoulders above their competitors,
both in terms of client confidence and sales success. The next section,
“The ABCs of CMAs,” has the lowdown on CMAs, including what they are
and the steps to follow as you perfect your CMA-performance skills.
The ABCs of CMAs
CMA is shorthand for competitive market analysis, a market review that stud-
ies the prices of sold properties, pending sales, and active and expired list-
ings to arrive at the current fair market value for a given property.

Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Most agents approach the CMA process with the mindset that the report’s
primary purpose is to educate sellers about the value of their property. I take
an opposite view and suggest you do the same.
I believe that the primary purpose of the CMA is to educate you, the agent,
about the prices at which comparable homes are being listed and sold. Only
by completing a competitive market review and analysis can you obtain cer-
tainty and conviction about the value of the property you’re getting ready to
list. With this knowledge, you can proceed with confidence as you share your
view of the marketplace and persuade the seller to accept your home pricing
recommendation.

Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price
Did someone say “bubble”?
In terms of equity growth and sales volume,
agents have just passed through the most pros-
perous years in the history of real estate for
North America. Recent years have logged
record sales numbers, with each year topping
the year before when it comes to number of
units sold and gross sales revenue.
Value appreciation in recent years reveals even
more shattered records: Many North Ameri-
can markets have seen property appreciation of
more than 75 percent over the last four years.
As a result, real estate owners have seen their
wealth grow dramatically — at least on paper.
Many have made more money than they ever
imagined possible with no effort beyond simply
holding on to properties purchased before
prices started climbing skyward.
In this environment, the following unrealistic
expectations arise:
 Many real estate owners expect prices 
to continue their current escalation 
with no end in sight. This view isn’t just 
improbable — it’s impossible. Real estate
appreciation will grind to a halt, and the
marketplace at large is already showing
signs of a slowdown.
 Many real estate owners unreasonably
believe that the large, unearned equity
homeowners 
enjoy 
(the 
difference
between what they paid and what their
property is currently worth) will always 
be there. This kind of thinking is fool hardy
and economically dangerous. You don’t
have to subscribe to the bubble-busting
theory to see that slower appreciation or
even a slight value correction is certain to
take place.
Consumers and agents must face and deal with
the truth that home prices go through periods 
of robust appreciation followed by periods of
marginal or minimal appreciation or even depre-
ciation in value.
Given the unrealistic views about value and
appreciation, take extra care to clearly inform
your clients that any current market analysis is
valid for only a short and specific time period.
As the marketplace changes, so will prices. By
covering this point early in your pricing discus-
sions you not only educate your clients, but you
also prepare sellers for the possibility that they
may need to consider price reductions in the
future.

Staying current
The key to the CMA, and in fact any valuation, is that it’s current. Whether
you analyze or interpret the value of a property using your own CMA, a
broker price opinion, or a third-party appraisal, you’re assessing the current
value of the property. In other words, you’re looking at what it’s worth right
now. Every time you use CMA results to counsel a seller or buyer on price,
take pains to explain that the evaluation is based on today’s market condi-
tions and today’s market timing and that many factors can influence the
value assessment either positively or negatively in the future.
Treat the CMA as a time-sensitive tool, and preface its results accordingly. Too
many consumers and even agents are misled into believing that a pricing value
opinion reflects the least a property will ever be worth, totally ignoring the pos-
sibility of market fluctuations that impact price regardless of the assessment
approach used to arrive at the valuation. For example, if you render a value
opinion and then the regional inventory of homes for sale explodes 30 days
later, you need to sharpen your pencil and start a new CMA, pronto. If you wait,
or if you stick to an outdated analysis, the increased inventory of homes for
sale could dramatically affect your seller’s ability to compete at the previously
established price.
Factors that contribute to a CMA
A competitive market analysis involves a review of all homes similar to the
one you’re selling that have recently sold or that have sales pending, active
listings, or recently expired listings in your marketplace. Activity in each of
these four categories contributes to your analysis; however, some categories
deserve greater importance or weight in your pricing assessment.
Sold properties
Often referred to as solds, sold properties provide the most valuable demon-
stration of market value. They’re properties for which sales goals have been
accomplished, transactions have closed, and ownership has transferred. The
sellers have their cash in hand, so you can be certain that the prices reflect
values that won mutual consent from a willing buyer and a willing seller. Use
these properties as the cornerstone of your presentation of value to the
seller. Use entries from all other categories primarily to support the pricing
position you recommend based on comparable sold properties. Solds also
demonstrate the original list price and the number of days on the market,
which shows you how competitive the home was in the marketplace.
Especially in markets undergoing active appreciation or depreciation, review
only homes that have sold and closed in the last six months or less. Sales
before that period aren’t likely to be an accurate indication of current values.
188
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Pending properties
Pending properties are homes that have been secured by a buyer, but the sale
hasn’t closed and ownership hasn’t transferred. Deals linger in the pending
stage for 30 to 60 days. When you study the pricing of comparable pending
sales, realize that the information is less reliable than that of sold homes
because:
 Anything can still happen to derail the transaction. The buyer can walk
away from the deal, or financing can be denied if either the owner or the
house doesn’t meet lending requirements. (For more on derailed trans-
actions, turn to Chapter 13.)
 The price on a pending deal is the price the seller initially asked, not
the final closing price. You won’t know the final closing price agreed
upon by the seller and buyer until the deal is completed. In some cases,
the closing price is substantially less or more than the asking price.
If a pending home is very comparable to the home you’re selling and its pric-
ing is very important to your CMA, contact the listing agent and ask if he or
she can tell you whether the seller received close to the asking price. Expect
only to receive general information; the agent can’t give you the sales price
due to fiduciary responsibility owed to the seller, but you’re likely to receive
enough information to help qualify the information received from pending
sale documents.
Active properties
Your seller’s eyes will wander straight to this part of the CMA because it usu-
ally contains the highest prices in the report. Without good counsel, sellers
look at the prices being asked for other homes and want to place their prices
right at the top of the range. To avoid unrealistic expectations, take the fol-
lowing actions:
 Explain that active properties are accompanied by asking prices that 
will be affected by the outcome of buyer negotiations and final price
adjustments.
 Present comparable active listings as a good indication of the level and
intensity of current competition for the buyer’s dollars rather than as a
clear indicator of current house value.
 Remind your seller that while she has only one house to sell, the buyer
in a neutral market has many homes to choose from. Use active listings
to help competitively position each house within the current available
inventory.
Expired listings
Expired listings are homes owned by sellers who, in effect, lost the sales game.
In a CMA, these listings provide a very good bookend against the prices of
189
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

sold properties. Presenting both categories lets you show your seller the
pricing path to success, as indicated by sold properties, and the path to fail-
ure, as indicated by expired listings.
For an especially instructive pricing example, find an expired listing that also
shows up in your sold category of properties. Use the example as a graphic
illustration of the first-time failure that can result from overpricing and the
eventual success that results from on-target pricing.
Creating a CMA
Real estate agents approach the CMA process in a number of different ways,
using various software tools and assembling findings in anything from plain
reports to impressive presentations filled with photos and jazzy graphics.
The real value of the CMA, however, isn’t in the packaging (although a great-
looking report is almost sure to help you communicate your findings more
clearly).
In my opinion, the real magic of the CMA process is that by gathering data
and making comparisons, you develop your marketplace knowledge and your
conviction and belief in your pricing recommendation. That knowledge and
certainty translates to client confidence and wise decision-making.
To prepare a CMA, you must first choose your CMA software tools and then
perform a little research and data assembly.
Choose your CMA software tools
Most MLS (multiple listing service) systems offer CMA software and classes
for agent use. I suggest you take advantage of any of courses that help you
gain familiarity and skill with the programs.
The software available through most MLS offices usually results in a basic
CMA template. If your real estate company provides software that results in a
fancier presentation, ask your broker or broker manager whether the com-
pany offers training and, if so, take advantage of it. Also, consult with other
agents about the software they use to produce their CMA reports.
Develop your data-gathering system
Whether you decide to use MLS-provided software, company-provided software,
or some other software tool, the outcome of your CMA really depends on the
data you put into it. Follow these steps to create an information-development
system that you can use over and over again each time you analyze the market
conditions for a new property:
190
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

1. Search for recently sold properties that are similar to the one you’re
selling in terms of square footage, number of bedrooms and bath-
rooms, and garage size.
In real estate lingo, these homes are called comps, short for comparable
properties. You don’t have to find homes that identically match the
offerings of the home you’re pricing but rather homes falling within a
reasonable range of the home in terms of square footage and number of
rooms. When you have a number of comparable homes to review, you
can tighten the range and reduce the number of comps that meet your
predetermined criteria. You may even take into account the age of a
property when selecting comparable homes. This is especially true with
newer or much older or historic types of homes.
When I was preparing CMAs and needed to pare down the number of
properties under review and achieve an accurate CMA, I’d tighten the
range requirement by adding search fields. For instance, I’d screen for
comparable homes in a certain school district or even within the bound-
aries of a specific grade school. In some areas of North America, being
within the boundaries of a certain grade school or middle school can
significantly influence the value of a property.
If the home you’re selling has a particularly distinctive attribute, such as
a very large yard or even acreage, add that feature to your search crite-
ria in order to find comparable properties for analysis.
2. Narrow your review down to 10 to 15 comparable homes, and evalu-
ate each property by comparing its features with those of the seller’s
property. Make a list of similarities and differences.
3. Estimate the value of the seller’s home by comparing its features to
each comparable home under review, applying pricing credits or
debits based on the differences you discover.
For instance, if a comparable property has one more bathroom than the
home you’re selling but is otherwise comparable, debit the value of that
bathroom from the comparable home’s sale price to arrive at a likely
value of the house you’re selling.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 with comparable pending sales, active list-
ings, and expired listings.
Expired listings will likely comprise the smallest group of properties you
review, but take special care to study each and every one. Check to see 
if the expired listing also appears on your list of recently sold, pending,
or active listings. Frequently, you’ll find that a listing that expired under
one agent or at one price was later picked up, re-priced, and re-offered
by another agent. The difference between the selling price at which it
became an expired listing and the price it’s currently listed at or at which
it finally sold provides a very clear indication of the home’s actual current
market value.
191
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

5. When you have a list of comparable homes from all four categories,
select four to six of the best, most comparable ones from each cate-
gory for study, evaluation, and inclusion in the CMA report you pre-
sent to the seller.
Your final selections should be very similar to the seller’s property, with
differences reflected by reasonable credits and debits.
6. Print out a complete listing for each of the properties you’ve selected
as comparable to your seller’s home.
You may not show each and every one to the seller, but you need to
have them on-hand at the appointment in case you need further ammo
to prove your point.
From start to finish, expect the creation of a CMA to take you somewhere
between a half hour and several hours, depending on your market area and
the kind of property you’re selling.
For example, suppose you’re listing a home in a production builder develop-
ment in which hundreds or even thousands of homes all feature one of only
six different floor plans. If your seller’s home is the Magnolia plan, guess
what? It’s going to end up with a price comparable to the price of every other
Magnolia home on the market or recently sold, regardless of differences in
finish work, fixtures, carpet, tile, or landscaping. The Magnolia plan will only
sell for so much — even if it has gold floors and gold toilets!
In technical jargon, neighborhoods filled with similarly designed homes by
the same builder are described as homogenous. If you’re selling homogenous
properties, you can conduct straightforward, easy-to-execute CMAs in almost
no time at all. But when you’re listing a unique property with no obvious
equivalent in the marketplace, plan to invest several hours assembling a
lengthy list of comparables and then conducting follow-up analyses to arrive
at an accurate pricing recommendation.
CMA mistakes to avoid
Agents commonly make three major mistakes in the CMA preparation
process: They work to establish a high sales price, they include too many
comparable homes in their comparison, and they overemphasize the price
per square foot. This section tells you how to avoid these traps.
Overpricing
If you approach a CMA with the desire to establish the highest sales price for
the seller, more often than not you end up with an overpriced listing. Remem-
ber, the goal of a CMA is to determine a demonstrated indication of the true
current value of the home. You’re not developing an opinion of what a buyer
192
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

may consider a reasonable value; you’re working with facts to arrive at an
objective, accurate valuation.
Explain the purpose of the CMA to your seller and achieve a meeting of minds
that you aren’t working to justify the highest price but rather to reflect
market conditions and arrive at an accurate value in order to present and sell
the house in a timely manner.
Presenting too many comps
I’ve seen agent-produced CMAs that include 10 or 15 comparable homes in
each category: sold, pending, active, and expired. Do the math — that adds
up to at least 40 home prices to review, which is more than enough to con-
fuse even the most analytical seller.
Beyond confusion, when presented with too many comps, many sellers latch
on to the most unreasonably priced homes in the review. Your seller may
wonder why he shouldn’t at least start at the price the people on Mulberry
got, even though that price is $20,000 over current market value.
To sidestep the pitfalls of too many comps, after you select four to six comps
for each category, stop gathering information and begin assembling your
CMA into final form.
Putting too much emphasis on “price per square foot” findings
When comparing prices, agents often calculate the price per square foot of
comparable properties. They arrive at this figure by taking a sale or listing
price and dividing it by the home’s square footage. For instance, a 1,500
square-foot home listed at $425,000 has a price per square foot of $283.33.
I personally believe price per square foot has a limited effect on value. For one
thing, it doesn’t account for the quality of a home — the quality of the finish
work, baseboards, casings, moldings, marble floors, granite countertops, ele-
gant appliances, top-grade bathroom fixtures, and landscaping extras. It doesn’t
factor in such features as stone exteriors, paved patios, extra garages, or archi-
tectural design features. Price per square foot treats each home like a box on a
plain vanilla lot, ignoring anything that really makes a house a home. Yet agents
and consumers use the calculation as if it were gospel — often using it to defend
low offers — when in reality, a long list of other factors make the price per
square foot calculation either meaningless or erroneous.
Taking CMA results with a grain of salt
I suggest you make “Stop and smell the roses” your mantra during the CMA
process. At some point during your review of real estate records, home
photos, and computer analyses, take a break and get out to actually look 
193
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

at comparable properties in order to form a good old-fashioned first-hand
opinion.
Don’t expect data sheets and digital photos alone to present the strengths,
weaknesses, and permutations of each comparable property. Some homes
just plain feel better than others, and that’s a distinction you have to experi-
ence live and in real time. Follow these suggestions:
 To view an active property, make an appointment with the seller.
 For a pending property, you can call the agent or the owner to gain entry
in order to evaluate the house against your seller’s home.
 Call owners for permission to view homes that have recently sold or that
have expired listings. You may even be able to turn a tour of an expired
listing into a prospecting preview. Play your cards right and your
research for one seller’s CMA may secure another seller’s listing.
If you can’t gain access to a home, at least take a few minutes to drive by any
of the comparables you’re studying. The drive gives you a chance to review
the neighborhood as well as the exterior condition, landscaping, and curb
appeal of each property.
Developing Your Pricing Philosophy
Ask a dozen agents to explain their home pricing philosophies and you’ll get
a dozen different approaches. And if the talk reveals frank responses, you’ll
also discover that the most common pricing strategy is no strategy at all.
Break out of the ranks by establishing and following a specific strategy for
arriving at the ideal selling price for each home. The best strategy to adhere to
is the one that says a properly priced home is practically sold. Adopt the phi-
losophy that in real estate sales, price is king. Price trumps all other factors —
including marketing approaches, home condition, market competitiveness,
and sales approach. I believe that in the end, marketing and condition of the
property are controlled by the price.
The alternative strategy, advocated by many agents, most sellers, and even
some sales trainers, is to emphasize marketing over pricing. Instead of work-
ing to set the ideal price, they believe success will come from optimizing the
home’s condition and presentation and then marketing it with skill and savvy.
Based on years of experience working with sellers who wanted unrealistic
prices for their homes and therefore experienced first-time sales failures, I
stick to the “price is king” approach. Over my sales career, I resurrected and
re-listed more than 600 expired listings — nearly 75 a year. In all those trans-
actions, I never met an owner with an expired listing who thought an unrea-
sonable price had anything to do with home’s failure to sell. They all blamed
194
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

the previous agent and that person’s approach to marketing. Each sought
some magic marketing strategy to change the reality of the law of supply and
demand. There is a magic strategy: Price the home correctly.
Price is the only factor that can overcome sales obstacles, compensate for a
home’s deficiencies, and motivate a purchaser even if the condition of the
property and your marketing approach are less than perfect. If you take and
price a good listing competitively, it will sell. You can’t keep a well-priced list-
ing a secret!
Avoiding overpricing just 
to please the buyer
Hope isn’t a successful pricing strategy, and the please-the-client mindset is a
difficult one to abandon. Agents who achieve listings with unrealistic prices
find it difficult to later counsel their clients honestly.
Does this scenario sound familiar? An agent (usually a newer agent) is short
on business or maybe even desperate for the chance to stake a sign in some-
one’s yard. The agent wants a listing at any price — even if the chance to seal
a deal on the listing erodes the likelihood of actually selling the property.
This is commonly referred to as buying the listing. To gain a seller’s nod of
approval, the agent makes a flatteringly high pricing recommendation, throw-
ing out a number the client wants to hear, and then hopes something good
will result from the bad situation. I can think of few examples, if any, in which
this approach actually works.
I have a friend with a home for sale where I live in Bend, Oregon. He selected
an agent who clearly demonstrates the “get the listing at any price” mentality.
The result: His home is for sale at a price at least $200,000 over market value.
Every agent in town knows it’s overpriced. The listing agent knows it, too, but
he’s more interested in the For Sale sign than the Sold sign. He’s hoping some-
thing good will come out of this poorly priced situation, but the only way the
seller and listing agent can come out on top is to find a two-suitcase buyer —
a buyer with one suitcase full of money and another suitcase full of stupidity!
The pitfalls of a please-the-client approach are many and significant. By over-
pricing, you can practically count on a reduction in your productivity, prof-
itability, and salability (your sales and success track) because
 It’s impossible to keep your productivity high when your time is spent
in conversations with an unsuccessful seller who lacks motivation to
take corrective action. The seller’s negativity, concerns, and phone calls
only increase with each week or month the house remains on the market.
As time goes on, you devote more and more time unsuccessfully trying
to create a sale, not only for your seller but also for yourself. This extra
work pulls you away from activities that are more likely to deliver income,
195
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

and the ensuing frustration strips your motivation and stunts your ability
to secure better appointments that create other income opportunities.
 An unsold, overpriced listing costs you time and money to service
while it delivers no revenue to your business. The situation only gets
worse the longer the listing languishes on the market. You’ll end up
deducting the expenses of this in-limbo listing from the proceeds gener-
ated by any revenue-producing deals you manage to close in the mean-
time, reducing your net profit and business success.
 Unsold homes that linger on the market seriously diminish your sala-
bility. Your salability is based on such key statistics as your average
ratio of listing price compared to sale price and the average number of
days your listings are on the market. Obviously, these statistics, which
prospects rely on when choosing one agent over another, can be
crushed if you want to get listings at any cost; they’re also harmed by
the tactic of starting high and reducing the price later, which I focus on
in the next section. You can also develop the reputation of being an
agent who only pounds For Sale signs into yards. People notice when
you haven’t posted any sold signs.
Steering clear of starting 
high and reducing later
No matter whether you’re selling real estate or any other offering, pricing
must reflect what the market will bear, not what the seller needs to net. Your
pricing deliberation should focus only on the value as determined by your
CMA (see “The ABCs of CMAs” earlier in this chapter).
I can’t count the number of times I’ve heard a seller start pricing discussions
by saying, “I really need to net this amount of money.” The declaration usu-
ally goes hand-in-hand with the seller’s instruction to “try this price, I don’t
want to give it away,” which is usually followed by the caveat, “We can always
come down but we can never go up.”
If you allow yourself to be swayed by a seller’s need to start higher than the
property should be priced, you set yourself up for a costly error.
As an example of the situation you want to avoid, review the anecdote in the
previous section about my friend’s overpriced home. You can bet his agent
didn’t arrive at a price $200,000 above market value based on research or
analysis. He listened to his client’s pricing input, which was based on what
my friend wants to net in order to buy another home for cash and avoid a
mortgage. Does the prospective buyer of his home care what he needs to
net? Absolutely not. Starting high is truly a ridiculous approach, but it’s all
too common. Most people who want to start high and reduce later are moti-
vated by the need to net a certain amount. Sadly, the approach is nearly
always counterproductive. Aiming too high rarely works.
196
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

The only market environment in which you can afford a seller who wants to
start high and come down later is when prices are rapidly appreciating and
inventory is low. Even then, be sure you’re working with an owner who really
wants to sell; otherwise you’re apt to waste time while your client tests the
market’s pricing tolerances.
If you find yourself facing a start-high seller, here are a few script suggestions
to help you get the seller on the right track:
 To figure out why the owner wants to sell and what role price plays in
the decision, ask, “Mr. Seller, is your motivation to sell your home
greater than your motivation to achieve a certain price?”
This powerful question unlocks the seller’s motivation vault. Going back
to the example I share in the “Avoiding overpricing just to please the
buyer” section, my friend’s motivation to obtain an inflated price
exceeds his motivation to sell. As an agent, I’d categorize him as a home
lister or market tester as opposed to a seller.
 If the seller’s stuck on his own profit motive, work to shift his mindset
to a buyer’s point of view by saying, “When we go out looking for a
home for you to buy, are you, as the buyer, concerned with what the
seller needs to net? Don’t you think that other buyers are going to feel
the same way you do?”
If necessary, add, “Then we can all agree that what a seller needs to net
truthfully has no real connection to the actual market value of the home.”
This script works well when housing inventory is normal or when an
oversupply creates a buyer’s market. It’s less effective in a seller’s
market, where housing inventory is in short supply. In that market, the
seller’s greed drives everything.
Coming in on-the-button
Even though too few agents use it, I personally believe that on-the-button
pricing — that is, pricing a home at market value — is the single best pricing
strategy.
Most agents pad listing prices by adding 5 to 10 percent to a home’s current
market value. This strategy is detrimental because even though sellers real-
ize the overpricing is meant to provide a negotiating allowance, they begin to
hope to receive at least some of the padding in their own pockets. They rarely
share that fact with their agents, but it’s a true underlying expectation and a
real downside of padding. The upside is that padded listings create a real
pricing advantage for homes that come on the market priced at their fair
market value.
197
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

A home that’s listed at market value stands out from the competition. Compared
to all the overpriced options, it strikes buyers as a rare value and leads to
traffic and a high number of showings by other agents. On-the-button pricing
also leads to a high increase in new business opportunities for the listing agent,
who meets numerous prospective clients as a result of to the home’s ads, sig-
nage, and online posting.
Troubleshooting Advice 
for Pricing Problems
Pricing recommendations hit troubled waters at two predictable times:
 When clients have unreasonable price expectations that need to be
brought in line before the home can be sold
 When an agent gets ready to list a property that owners want to sell at
an inflated, unrealistic price
Both circumstances require caution. The following sections offer advice as
you troubleshoot your way through to a successful pricing decision.
Reducing prices: A five-step formula
When a client has her mind set on a price that’s out of line, the following
steps can help you bring her thinking back to reality.
1. Nip it in the bud
If you’re dealing with a prospective new client, address the pricing issue at
the listing presentation. Don’t think the difference of opinion will just go
away, and don’t think you can make an easy adjustment later.
Be proactive. Present your analysis of market realities as they are, not as your
client may wish them to be. If you delay the discussion, you’ll just lose time,
effort, and emotion later on when you could and should be focusing your
energy on new business development and other income-producing activities.
2. Get the client to agree to come down
If a client suggests that she “start high and come down later,” have her agree
at the listing presentation to a scheduled price reduction. In order to start at
their desired prices, sellers often say something like, “I’ll reduce the price to
your recommendation in 30 days.” When they make such a statement, usually
198
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

they’re simply trying to end the discussion, hoping they can hold out and
ultimately achieve their target prices. You need to take action and lock in a
price-reduction agreement there and then in order to avoid the same discus-
sion a month into the future.
Use the following script as you respond to the seller’s willingness to take
action in 30 days:
“Mr. Seller, what I hear you saying is that you’ll reduce your price in 30 days.
Is that correct? You want to try your price for 30 days, but after that, we will
move to the price I recommended, correct?”
When your client answers yes to both questions (as clients do in nine out of
ten presentations, mainly because they’ve been able to delay the pain and
want to move on), proceed with the locking technique, using this script:
“Mr. Seller, since we’re both in agreement about a price reduction in 30
days, and due to your business schedule and mine, let’s go ahead and
acknowledge your approval of the scheduled price adjustment, post-dated
for 30 days from now.”
Although all you’re doing is formalizing your client’s suggestion, the above
script will likely be met by a long moment of silence, perhaps accompanied by
a confused look. The key to a successful outcome is to sit silently — whoever
speaks first will lose this battle of wills. If you break the silence, almost cer-
tainly your client won’t sign the price adjustment form. Wait patiently, and in
more than half the cases, you’ll get a signed form agreeing to the upcoming
price adjustment.
In other cases, you’ll at least pave the way for the future reduction, although
some sellers develop selective amnesia on the subject. If you talk to your
seller 30 days later and hear, “I don’t remember ever talking about having to
reduce our price,” remind her that you asked her to sign a price reduction
the night of the listing.
3. Compile pricing feedback from Day 1
Begin compiling pricing feedback the day the listing hits the market. When
other agents show the home, follow up by asking them to share their pricing
opinions. Continue reviewing the prices of comparable homes that have sold
while your listing’s been on the market.
When interviewing another agent, you may have to really probe to obtain
useful feedback. For example, ask what top three things the agent’s client
liked about the home. Ask for suggestions for enhancing the salability of the
home. Most importantly, ask if the price seems competitive with other homes
shown. If the agent says the price feels out of line, ask what price seems more
199
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

reasonable, and then ask if the agent would be willing to scratch out a quick
note summarizing the opinion. In future price-reduction discussions with
your seller, you can back your own recommendation with recommendations
from other experts. In essence, you can demonstrate that the marketplace
has spoken in favor of your advice.
4. Revisit the price-reduction discussion
Revisit the price-reduction discussion within weeks of the listing. If you wait
until 30 days have passed you will have waited too long, and here’s why. It
usually takes one or two weeks to re-open the pricing subject, gain a price-
reduction agreement, obtain a signature on a price-reduction form, and get
the new price posted. Therefore, if you wait a month to get started the price
likely won’t be reduced until week six. Studies repeatedly prove that once a
home’s been on the market six to eight weeks, showing activity drops signifi-
cantly. So if you wait until 30 days to revisit the pricing conversation your
window of marketing activity will be almost closed by the time you finally
post the reduction.
5. Schedule a price-reduction meeting if you have to
If a phone conversation with your seller doesn’t prompt an agreement to a
price reduction, schedule a meeting in your office. You raise the odds for a
successful outcome exponentially when you make the pricing recommenda-
tion in a face-to-face meeting on your own your turf and in a professional
environment. As a last resort, you may have to show the sellers the competi-
tion. Make arrangements to take them on a tour through the other homes
they’re competing against.
When you call to arrange the meeting, use the following script (in which the
key word is “exposure”):
“Mr. Seller, I need to meet with you later this week to discuss the strategy to
increase the exposure of your home. Would Wednesday or Thursday be
better for you?”
The word “exposure” leads the seller to think you’ll be rolling out a whole
new marketing strategy for her home. For that, she’ll gladly clear her calen-
dar. If you say the meeting is to talk about a price reduction, chances are
good that the seller will try to stall and may even start ducking your calls.
You have to use the right script and right approach.
Truth is, the meeting will in fact lead to increased exposure for the listing,
because price is the factor that most controls exposure. If you can move the
price into the competitive zone, agents are more likely to show the home,
and ads more effectively reach a larger group of better buyers.
200
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Accepting over-priced listings
If a seller’s motivation is high, you may still want to take the listing. If she
wants to list her home at a price that exceeds current market value, be sure
she meets the criteria I cover in this section. Otherwise, you’re gambling with
your time, effort, money, and energy and with the odds of a Powerball win.
Strong motive to sell
Your client’s motivation to sell is the key indicator of whether you’ll earn a
fee for your service on an over-priced listing. You get paid only when your
client’s property sells and closes, so evaluate and re-evaluate the seller’s
interest and determination to complete the transaction.
If a client absolutely has to sell — because of a job transfer, divorce, financial
difficulty, a growing family, or a new home purchase for which sales proceeds
are required — the odds of a successful closing swing strongly in your favor.
The pressure of the pending circumstances pushes the seller to complete the
deal even if it involves a necessary price adjustment.
A client who has already purchased another home becomes increasingly
motivated to sell as the pressure of making two house payments comes to
bear. I’ve seen clients undergo complete attitude adjustments regarding the
price of their sale property around the first of the month, when they had to
write two mortgage checks. Ultimately, the pain of that second check is
greater than the pain of the price reduction.
Financial capacity to sell at “true” market value
If a seller owes more on the mortgage than the home is currently worth, she
needs to come up with the difference between the sale proceeds and the loan
balance at the time of closing. If she doesn’t have the necessary resources,
don’t take on the listing at any price.
Over the past few years, many homeowners have pulled cash out of their
homes and have taken new mortgages based on appreciated home values
that have already stagnated or declined. When sellers in this situation get
ready to sell, they owe more on their mortgage balances than they’ll reap
from the equity they’ve accumulated. This situation can cause problems for
the agent. You must be sure that the seller has the equity or funds from
another source to sell at fair market value and pay your fee as well.
Set this rule in stone: Take on listings only for owners with sufficient equity
to sell at real market value or sufficient other assets to make up the shortfall.
201
Chapter 10: Determining a Home’s Ideal List Price

Willingness to make a long-term commitment
If you agree to list a property at a price that exceeds its current market value,
insist on a listing term of at least six months. Six months gives you enough
time to market the property, reduce the price if necessary, and even put a
second transaction together if the first one doesn’t close.
Too often, sellers who want to stretch beyond top dollar value also want to
give you a short time frame in which to prove yourself. Follow this rule
instead: Insist that the term of your listing align with the price of the listing.
For example, take a 30-day listing only if it’s backed by a 30-day price — with
a 30-day price defined as a price that is 5 to 10 percent below fair market
value. Most sellers want a 30-day listing at a price that is 10 to 15 percent
above market value. No deal! Use the following script to align the listing
period with the sale price:
“Mr. Seller, based on the price you want for your home, I’m going to need a
12-month listing agreement. You’re asking a 12-month price, so I will need
12 months to accomplish a sale. Now, if you want to set a 90-day price of x
dollars, then I would be able to take a 90-day listing. What is your desire?
Which of these options do you prefer?”

for presenting
 Tips for helping a home make a great first impression
G
etting a home ready for the big show is necessary to achieve a sale. The
more competitively the home is priced and prepared, the sooner the
rigor of showing will end. And, the sooner the sale takes place, the sooner
your clients can return to their normal routines — except for that little chal-
lenge of packing and moving. This chapter helps you guide clients as they
transform their homes from how they look most of the time to how they need
to look to win attention and positive decisions from prospective buyers.
Advising Different Kinds of Sellers
All home sellers come with their own personalities and personal quirks, but
when it comes to preparing a home for presentation you’ll find that nearly all
sellers fit into one of five categories. As you begin to counsel clients regarding
changes and repairs that they must consider, it won’t take long to recognize
whether you’re working with a Mr. Fix-It, a gung-ho renovator, a stuck-in-the-
’60s lover of the past, a do-nothing couch potato, or a human calculator.
At the point of staging a home for sale, each of these personality types brings
favorable and unfavorable qualities to the task. The secret is to prepare your-
self and your advice by figuring out early in the relationship just who you’re
working with. The following sections help you understand each of these per-
sonality types.

Mr. Fix-It
This seller is ready, willing, and even enthusiastic to dive in and go way over-
board completing projects before the home is ready to be shown.
Think of Tim “The Tool Man” Taylor and you’ll have a good idea of this seller’s
enthusiasm and approach. Then think of the results you’ve seen on the Home
Improvement show for a good sense of the kind of outcome that may be in the
script. Your only problem is that Al won’t be around when you need him.
 The Downside: Mr. Fix-It has all the tools and is ready to use them at the
drop of a hat. The problem is the work may not be done to industry
standards, and so instead of an improved condition, the home could end
up with more problems than it had to begin with.
 The Solution: When you spot a Mr. Fix-It, discuss changes in detail
before any work begins. Discuss industry standards of quality with Mr.
Fix-It. Ask him if he knows what the finished product would look like if a
licensed and bonded contractor did the work. Ask about industry stan-
dards for nailing, painting, gluing, plumbing, tiling, dry walling, roofing,
and other tasks that may sound easier than they really are.
You want to ask Mr. Fix-It the questions about quality to ensure he has
the skill to produce a product that meets or exceeds industry standards.
Poorly executed repair work is obvious to potential buyers and can stop
them from making an offer on the property. Or, they may offer a lower
price due to the low-quality repairs.
Bring the seller’s spouse or significant other into the conversation. The
person who lives with a Mr. Fix-It understands where the power tool
obsession ends and repair ability begins. With luck and skill, together
you’ll keep enthusiasm in check and help put a damper on the idea to
jack up and rotate the house so that the front yard becomes the back
yard, giving the kids more room to play.
The gung-ho renovator
Gung-ho renovators are owners who do everything way over the top. When
it’s time to prepare their home for sale, they practically create a whole new
house before marketing begins. Once their makeover is complete, they some-
times find the results so impressive that they pull the property off the market
and stay to enjoy the outcome of their efforts.
 The Downside: Without good counsel, these owners cross the line
between repairs and remodeling. Along the way, they spend way too
much time and far more money than they can recover when they sell.
204
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

 The Solution: Be clear about the seller’s objective when preparing a
home for sale. Impress upon the owners that the aim is to economically
increase the warmth and desirability of the home and to remove poten-
tial objections that buyers might have against the home. The goal is not
to achieve perfection. Remind them that in home fix-up, repair, and stag-
ing they’ll find a point of diminishing return. It’s easy for the gung-ho
seller to cross that line.
Stuck in the ’60s
With no further description, you know the look of a stuck-in-the-’60s seller’s
home. From furnishings to artwork to floor coverings and color schemes, the
entire place is decades out of style and, worse still, the owners love it the
way it is. I know firsthand, because I watched the family home I grew up in sit
too long on the market because it was stuck in the past. My mother loved the
colors of the ‘60s and was resolute to keep them in place for as long as she
was alive.
 The Problem: The décor is so overwhelmingly dated that buyers have a
difficult time getting past the aesthetics and imagining what it would be
like to redecorate and move into the home.
 The Solution: Somehow, you have to point out to the sellers that the
look of the ’60s (or the ’70s and ’80s, for that matter) needs to be toned
down, dialed back, or moved forward a few notches in order gain buyer
interest in the home. Younger buyers have no nostalgia for the “old
days” and many older buyers don’t care to remember the décor from
that era.
Most times, sellers won’t do a complete redecoration. Often the best you
can hope for is removal of the shag carpet. From that point on, you may
have to artfully sell around the avocado-colored appliances.
The couch potato
Coach potatoes want top dollar for their homes but don’t want to lift a finger
to get it. Their favorite tool is the remote control.
 The Problem: Sellers in this category claim complete satisfaction with
their home just the way it is. They don’t want to clean it up, pick it up, or
repair it so it works better. They feel that someone out there is willing to
pay top dollar for the home, regardless of its mediocre condition. They
simply want the agent to find them the right buyer. Couch potatoes are
also the people who insist they always win when they go to Las Vegas.
205
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing

 The Solution: Seek a compromise. Make a list of recommended repairs
and get the owner to take action on at least some items, because some-
thing is better than nothing. Then work to adjust the owner’s price expec-
tations in light of the property conditions you’ve exposed. The owner
either has to settle for repairs or a lower asking price — they can’t have
it both ways without hurting the agent’s stats.
The calculator
Of all the types of sellers, human calculators can be the most difficult. They
can tell you, in detail, every investment they ever made in their home. If you
want, they’ll be happy to provide you with receipts.
 The Downside: These sellers expect to recoup every dollar they ever
spent fixing up their home. If you counsel that additional work is needed
to prepare the home for sale, they’ll expect the sale proceeds to reflect
at least a dollar-for-dollar reimbursement of the expenses involved.
 The Solution: Reorient the sellers’ view of the task at hand — preparing
the house for sale. Explain that the recommended investment covers
improvements that bring the home back up to expected consumer stan-
dards and make it competitive in the current marketplace. Help the
owners understand that they’re preparing their home not to achieve a
higher sales price, but to gain buyer consideration that leads to a timely
purchase offer.
Counseling Clients on 
Home Improvements
Before you start to counsel owners about home improvements, remember
these two rules:
 First and foremost, never counsel before you’re hired. Counseling hap-
pens after a client-relationship is established. Attorneys don’t offer legal
advice before their services have been officially retained. Doctors don’t
diagnose without assurance of compensation. Real estate agents should
follow suit. Wait until the listing agreement is signed. After it’s signed,
begin giving counsel regarding how the owner can achieve a quicker sale
or higher price by making recommended home improvements and
implementing staging advice.
206
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Too frequently, agents give away their expert counsel during listing presen-
tations in hopes of proving their ability and expertise to sellers. More often
than not, though, the sellers simply take the counsel with them when they
link up with an agent who is less skillful but promises a cheaper fee.
 Second, tell the truth. If the sellers need to clean the home, tell them. If
they’re smokers and the house reeks from cigarettes, or if their pets are
causing odor problems, tell them.
Likewise, appearances can kill buyer interest. If the home is crowded
with too much stuff, say so. If the pink exterior color may cause people
to drive right on by, speak up. Holding your tongue only delays the day
of reckoning. What’s more, it’s easier to be totally frank when you first
notice the problem — though only after the listing contract is signed). If
you counsel before you gain commitment, your advice may offend the
sellers and cost you the listing. This is another reason to follow Rule #1
and get a signature before giving counsel.
Improvements that contribute 
to the sales price
When it comes to preparing a home for sale, worthwhile and necessary
improvements fall into three categories:
 Improvements that bring a home back to standard.
 Improvements that correct defects.
 Improvements that enhance curb appeal or first impressions.
The following sections provide guidelines for each area.
Bringing a home back to standard
Before you present a home with horribly dated décor, counsel the sellers to
modernize the interior look to align it with the expectations of current-market
buyers. Sellers don’t have to go overboard; they just need to use a reason-
able color scheme and provide enough of an update so that new owners feel
they can move in without having to undertake an immediate facelift. Share
the following advice with sellers:
 Keep improvements simple. A total redecoration isn’t necessary or
even advisable. The objective is to arrive at a widely-acceptable and 
reasonably-current color scheme with paint, counters, and floor 
coverings.
207
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing

 Don’t aim to create a design showpiece. Realize that following the pur-
chase buyers often change a home significantly to make it their own.
The sellers’ objective is to allow prospective buyers to feel that their
changes can happen over the next few years — that they’re not glaringly
and immediately necessary.
 Focus on the big stuff. If the interior of a home looks current and the
landscaping, yard, decks, and patios are well kept and serviceable, the
buyers’ need to make significant, immediate changes lowers greatly. As a
result, they’ll be more likely to buy the home. They may also make a
more competitive initial offer than would be the case if the home pre-
sented obvious exterior or interior color or repair issues. If buyers have
to make changes to a home, they have to pay for them with their own
personal funds, not with money they borrow. Many buyers consider this
fact when deciding which home they should buy.
 A little paint makes a huge difference. Repainting is one of the most
cost effective ways to freshen the look of a home. It can even disguise
design shortcomings.
 Steer clear of the latest trends. Counsel clients to shy away from the
current rage in deep wall colors. Advise them to create a warm, blank
canvas that any prospective buyer can work with.
Correcting defects
If a home has defects, the seller has two choices: Fix them or provide equal
monetary compensation to the buyers.
For example, if a roof needs repair or replacement, the improvement will be
expected by both the bank and the buyer. The seller can offer one of the fol-
lowing two remedies:
 Handle and pay for the repair or replacement.
 Provide the buyers with sufficient compensation to cover the cost and
hassle of correcting the defect themselves. Hassle compensation is
money above what it costs to professionally correct the problem. The
amount extended for hassle compensation differs by task and buyer. In
most cases, though, if buyers have to collect and decide between con-
tractor bids, arrange for repairs, and check the work of the contractor,
they’ll want some compensation for their time and effort.
Other items that may need to be addressed are excessively worn carpet
or windows whose seals have been broken and condensation has built
up between the panes.
Enhancing first impressions
Any cost-effective improvement that adds curb appeal or enhances first
impressions can increase the sales price. Here are a few improvements the
seller can do:
208
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

 Create dimension on the exterior of the home by adding shutters or fish
scale over a garage gable, selecting a better color pallet, and, certainly,
spending a few hundred dollars to plant annuals to brighten the exterior
walkways. The effect will increase the probability of a sale and positively
influence the sale price.
 Inside the house, after improving the home’s paint color scheme, advise
sellers to assess the quality of the home’s hard surfaces, including
carpet, tile, vinyl, and counter tops. Replacing surfaces is often far less
costly than buyers anticipate. Many choices look expensive but aren’t. A
seller doesn’t need to put slab granite on the kitchen counters. Simply
updating old, cracked, and chipped Formica will deliver a great improve-
ment and pay off when it comes to price negotiation. Choosing a light
surface can create a feeling of a larger, brighter room.
 When working with a limited budget (as most sellers do) counsel the
sellers to improve surfaces in core areas first. Focus on the areas most
used by buyers, which include the kitchen, family room, bathroom
(especially the master bath), and master bedroom.
Improvements to skip
As a general rule, I advise sellers to skip any improvement that isn’t simple or
doesn’t affect curb appeal.
209
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing
The myth of the bargain in the basement
Advise sellers who want to increase home
value by finishing their basements to proceed
with caution for the following reasons:
 Any remodel returns only a portion of its
cost at the time of sale, and historically
basement remodels yield the lowest return
of all.
 Even if the home is on a sloping lot that
allows for a really nice walk-out or daylight
basement, in many areas of the U.S. the
value of the basement square footage is
half that of ground-level or above-ground
level square footage.
 Too many sellers calculate home price or
value on a square foot basis, and therefore
they see an unfinished basement as a kind
of lotto ticket. This is especially true for Mr.
Fix-It and gung-ho personality types, who
see the unfinished basement as an easy
route to a higher home price.
Use these facts to help your sellers understand
that their finished basement is likely not going
to return the dollars they put into the remodel,
and that the resulting additional square footage
will almost certainly be worth less than they
envision.

When sellers ask about replacing cabinets, remodeling rooms, building book-
shelves, replacing siding, adding decks, and even finishing basements, share
the following facts:
 According to Remodeling magazine and the National Association of
Realtors, the average major investment update on a home recoups 81
percent at resale, or only four out of five dollars spent.
 The highest average rate of return results from a minor kitchen remodel,
which yields 93 percent of the costs incurred.
 The lowest average rate of return comes from finishing a basement,
which yields a 76 percent return. See the upcoming sidebar titled “The
myth of the bargain in the basement” for more details on the risks of fin-
ishing a basement.
 The more money spent, the higher the risk for the seller and the lower
the chance of making a return or even breaking even.
Passing the Curb Appeal Test
As a listing agent, one of the first rules of real estate you need to remember is
that you have to get prospective buyers and other agents into the house that
is for sale. They won’t buy it — or advise others to buy it — if they don’t step
inside to see it. Real estate investors are the only exception to this rule:
They’ll often buy a house without ever looking at it. However, most sellers
don’t want to settle for the price a shrewd investor would pay. To get top
dollar, you must win the curb appeal game.
As an agent, nothing is more discouraging than giving up your Saturday or
Sunday afternoon to host an open house, only to watch cars drive by without
stopping all afternoon. The culprit is almost always a lack of curb appeal —
or first-glance pizazz. The second most common reason is that the home is in
a less-than-desirable neighborhood.
Few people have the gift to see what a home could look like. My wife, Joan,
has that gift. She can look at a listing that I know isn’t quite right and tell me
exactly what to suggest to the seller. The upcoming sections provide similar
advice for you to follow.
Landscaping
Landscaping recommendations depend largely on the age of the home you’re
getting ready to show. Newer homes are frequently so under-landscaped that
they look remarkably like the surface of the moon. Meanwhile, older homes
210
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

are surrounded by such overgrown trees and bushes that they look like the
jungles of Brazil.
Know the age of the home you’re listing and more often than not you’ll imme-
diately know what kind of tool your sellers need to use to ready their prop-
erty for showing: a machete or a shovel.
The most frequent curb-appeal obstacle comes from overgrown landscaping,
which needs to be attacked with the following steps:
 Trim trees to create openness in the yard area. Large fir or evergreen
trees can make a yard look smaller than its actual size, particularly if
expansive branches hang close to the ground. Advise the seller to
remove some of the limbs of larger trees so that there is a 12 to 15 foot
gap off of the ground.
 Use the space opened by tree trimming to plant colorful annuals,
which will brighten up the yard. You should also use annuals to
brighten the sidewalks and paths to and around the front door.
 If the seller’s yard features grass, make sure it’s healthy and green.
Recommend that sellers put down extra seed or replace sod in troubled
spots if necessary. You want to achieve a look that’s more like a golf
course than a motocross course.
 Add landscape dimension to otherwise flat lots with plants, berms, or
rocks. Don’t overdo it, but do add a little height and depth to break what
otherwise might look like a dull lot.
 Create dimension through color. The landscaping can look pretty
monochromatic if you’re presenting a home in a season other than
spring. Colorful plants go a long way toward adding visual interest and
strengthening curb appeal.
Exterior paint condition and color
In a split-second, the color and condition of a home’s exterior paint can
either attract or repel a prospective buyer.
 Color: Recommend that sellers think long and hard about pastel colors
like robin’s egg blue or baby pink, or color schemes that resemble the
uniforms of their college or university teams. Just as with hard surfaces
on the inside, the exterior of a home for sale should be painted in clas-
sic, muted tones, such as taupe or beige with a soft accent color that is
slightly darker than the body of the home.
The architecture of the home can contribute to the decision regarding
what colors are appropriate for the home. For example, white paint on a
211
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing

colonial-style home can enhance the property’s visual impression from
the curb, evoking the image of great, stately homes such as the White
House or President Washington’s Mt. Vernon home. However, the same
white paint on a 1950s or 1960s ranch home may result in a house that
looks like a plain little box with no character.
 Paint condition: Buyers are quick to cross homes in need of new paint
off their lists, whether the chipped paint is on the body or trim of the
home or on fences or railings.
The worst outcome is when a prospective buyer drives by, but doesn’t
stop. However, even if he decides to stop and look at the house, trouble
still lurks. If the exterior paint condition is poor and buyers consider the
home anyway, you may wish they hadn’t, and here’s why: Once buyers
notice that paint is peeling, cracking, chipping, or stripped down to bare
wood, they go into high-scrutiny mode and begin to pick the home
apart. Rather than looking for wonderful things about the home, they
fixate on what they think is wrong. They assume that because something
as obvious as the paint is in poor condition that other aspects of the
home were also neglected. A buyer determined to find faults will suc-
ceed. No home can withstand a microscopic faultfinding inspection.
Even if the home passes the inaugural buyer examination, the sellers
aren’t out of the woods. If the buyer decides to make an offer, almost cer-
tainly it will be accompanied by an extensive repair list and the request
that every minor offense be rectified before the closing. Then a home
inspector will enter the picture, providing a more extensive report and
the chance for the buyer to hit the seller up all over again. All this hap-
pens because of a little chipping paint that could (and should) have been
fixed before buyers ever drove by to view the home in the first place.
Prepping the Interior of the Home
Once prospective buyers are through the door, you need them to be greeted
by a good first impression. Help sellers achieve the lightest, brightest, and
largest interior possible by taking the upcoming advice to heart.
In preparation for this chapter, I put myself in the seller’s shoes and looked
around our own home, asking myself what we’d need to do if we wanted to
sell. Big surprise: We’d need to rid each room of our home of tons of belong-
ings, decorations, and furniture. We all have too much stuff. We have kids
whose toys are broken or aren’t played with anymore. We have clothes that
hang in closets for years while we await the miracle weight-loss drug. One of
the reasons homes over the years have grown in size is because we need
more and more room to put our stuff.
212
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

To help sellers prepare their home interiors for showing, have them take two
initial steps:
 Get them to rent a drop box or large dumpster and throw away any-
thing they haven’t used in a while. In fact, you may benefit by doing the
same thing in your own home. You’d be amazed at how invigorating it is
to have that drop box in the driveway for a weekend. It’s almost like a
game to see how far and how fast you can fill it to the top. For most
people who’ve lived in the same home for a while, it won’t take long.
 Convince the sellers to rent a storage unit. After filling a dumpster to
the gills they may still have things that should be moved out of the
house even if they don’t want to move them out of their lives. A storage
unit provides an inexpensive, readily available solution.
After these initial steps are taken, you and the sellers can focus on other
ways to make the home more appealing to potential buyers. Read on for 
suggestions.
Staging a home
The term staging a home describes the process of rearranging and decorating
a home’s interior in an effort to downplay deficiencies and accent strengths.
In its simplest form, staging involves adding specialty accessories like towels,
candles, throw rugs, bedding, pillows, dishes, napkins, and stemware. Staging
at its most extensive level involves rearranging or replacing furniture or even
adding specialty furniture pieces to create a feeling of comfort and livability.
Before you advise clients on the staging process, gain knowledge about basic
staging techniques and outcomes by visiting newly developed neighborhoods
with model homes. Invest the time to see how new homes are being shown.
Notice how the most appealing homes present master baths. Take a close
look at desirable kitchens to see what is and isn’t on the countertops. Note
how towels, dishes, and glassware are displayed. Most of all, study how furni-
ture is arranged in variously shaped rooms to create an environment that is
open, warm, and comfortable.
If you’re really challenged by staging and design, turn to pros for help. In
most real estate markets you’ll find people who specialize in staging homes
for sale. Many interior decorators offer hourly consultation. Others offer, for
a fee, full-service staging, where they work up a design plan, bring in the 
furniture and accessories, handle the installation, and dismantle it all after
the sale.
213
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing

Find out the names and experience levels of staging or interior design spe-
cialists in your market area. Then be ready to convince your sellers that it’s
in their best interest to invest in their home’s interior look. Remind them that
well-staged homes attract not only buyer prospects but also agents, who
want to show attractive homes. In many cases, the investment pays off in two
ways: A faster sale and a higher price.
Clearing the clutter
When buyers are house shopping they’re given the challenge of mentally
removing the seller’s stuff before deciding whether they actually want to
move in. This type of mental gymnastics helps buyers assess how well the
home they’re viewing will accommodate their own possessions. (See the sec-
tion “Helping the buyer ‘move in’” later in the chapter for tips to help buyers
with these mental gymnastics.)
Some sellers’ homes are so full of garage sale and flea market finds that the
buyers honestly can’t see the home through the clutter. They can’t “move in”
because they can’t see anywhere for their own things to go.
If you’re working with sellers who are surrounded by clutter, do the following:
 Advise them to remove excessive amounts of accessories and knick-
knacks. Whether they get rid of them altogether or pack them up in
preparation for their anticipated move, get them out of sight. The result
can do wonders for a home’s interior appearance.
 Dismantle what I call the “shrine wall.” A wall of pictures of children,
grandchildren, nieces, nephews, friends, acquaintances, and snapshots
of every experience the owners fondly remember adds clutter with little
to no buyer appeal.
 Follow the design rule, “When in doubt, take it out.” Advise sellers to
keep clutter, wall décor, and placement of figurines and mementos to a
bare minimum.
What “stuff” to keep and what to remove
The point in showing a home is to allow prospective buyers to mentally move
in and assess how well the home fits with their lives and possessions. Real
estate agents know to listen and watch for buying signals, and one of the
clearest and best signs is when buyers discuss how their own belongings
may fit in various rooms.
Buyers can hardly think about where their piano, china cabinet, or most-
treasured family heirloom will go when they can’t get their eyes past the
visual onslaught of furnishings, accessories, and clutter of the current
owners. Use the following information to guide your recommendations
214
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

regarding what sellers should leave in place and what they should move out
prior to home presentation.
 Pictures: Suggest that the owners pack up all but a few of the personal
photos in the home. If they have a wall covered with pictures, advise
them to pare down to just a few.
 Appliances: Except the ones that get used daily, store all small kitchen
appliances. Leave the coffee maker on the counter, but lose the blender
and maybe even the toaster.
 Vanity items: Remove most of what is on the bathroom vanity, including
decorations and toiletries. A collection of items draws attention to a
small vanity size.
 Closets: Thin clothes out of closets to create the illusion of greater
space. Even a good-sized closet that is crammed with clothes looks
undersized and inadequate.
 The garage: Too often, what gets removed from the home goes into 
the garage. Don’t let your sellers make this mistake. Ask them to move
household items into a rented storage unit instead. While they’re at it,
they can move garage items — from extra sets of tires to out-of-season
recreation equipment — to the storage unit. Then advise them to orga-
nize what’s left. Suggest that they hang bicycles from the ceiling and
install a few inexpensive pre-made cabinets to hold paint cans, tape,
shop rags, toolboxes, and the rest of the amazing collection of stuff that
ends up in most garages. The objective is to end up with a clean, spacious
garage that adds openness and perceived square footage to the home —
and dollars to the seller’s final sales price.
If you encounter seller resistance, remind your clients that they’re going to
have to pack their stuff up anyway. By preparing their home for presentation
they eliminate visual clutter and get a leap on the packing process at the
same time.
Simplifying traffic flow
The design rule, “When in doubt, take it out,” applies to furniture as well.
Rooms that feel cramped and hard to move through usually have too much
furniture in too little space.
To make a diagnosis and suggest recommendations, do the following:
 Walk through the home to find the spots that feel cramped. Where do
transition areas from room-to-room, or from one part of a room to
another, feel restricted?
215
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing

 Make recommendations to improve traffic flow. The sellers can’t move
walls (without great expense), but they can move furniture that restricts
movement.
 Evaluate the number of pieces of furniture in each room and note the
sizes of each piece. Ask yourself the following questions:
• Are too many pieces of furniture crowded into one room?
• Are furnishings too large and beefy for the room?
• Does the furniture arrangement work in terms of space and flow?
 Be on the lookout for small, decorative pieces of furniture. These
pieces are often the biggest culprits when it comes to restricting walk-
ways and creating a crowded feeling.
Most people have too much furniture in too small of a space. Be ready to 
recommend that the sellers remove furniture to create more open spaces,
which makes the home appear larger and more comfortable.
Your furniture-removal recommendations will most likely be met by owner
resistance. Sellers will resist because they think that there won’t be any place
for people to sit. Stick to your story: Tell them a home with too little furniture
almost always shows better than a home with too much.
Toning it down
Themed bedrooms — those with wallpaper, wallpaper borders, sheets, pil-
lows, comforters, and wall hangings that all match — are very popular for
children today. The problem is that buyers walk in and can’t see an alternate
use for the room. If they can actually see an alternate use, they may also see
the considerable expense and effort it will take to get the room from where 
it is to where they’d like it to be in terms of decoration and usability. As a
result, the seller will likely offer a lower price, if they make an offer at all, in
order to cover the costs they anticipate when replacing the theme with a
more neutral design.
Be on the lookout for the following red flags:
 Loud or outlandish paint colors or wall coverings
 Immediately visible and highly personalized themes. For example, a
vibrant pink bedroom with lots of stuffed animals might be off-putting to
empty nesters or a family that has only boys.
Explain to the sellers that some buyers may be design-challenged and may
have little sense of how to redecorate or of how much it costs to paint or
wallpaper a room. Tell them that a more neutral design will attract more
buyer interest and command a higher price.

House clean-up checklist
Don’t assume that buyers understand what needs to be done before a show-
ing, even if they have bought and sold a home before. Take a proactive stance
by providing a detailed step-by-step checklist of the steps they need to take
before the first buyer presentation. The chart in Figure 11-1 provides you
with a good sample to follow as you provide your clients with valuable coun-
sel and help them ready their home for presentation.

Final Ways to Make a 
Great First Impression
Selecting a home is not a logical undertaking for most buyers. Instead, it’s more
of an emotional upheaval. Most buyers are swayed by the initial emotions they
feel when they first walk through the door of a potential new home. Almost
instantly, the home either feels right or feels wrong.
Rarely do people warm up to a home. Once buyers receive a first impression,
they soon figure out whether or not a home is “the one.” That first impres-
sion can be the beginning of a sales success, or it can be a prohibitive factor
that will be difficult to overcome.

Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

I remember hearing my mother tell the story of helping my grandmother find
a home to buy. They had looked at many homes before they walked into one
that my grandmother actually liked. In fact, within two minutes she was danc-
ing around the house saying, “This is the one I am going to buy. I want to this
house now.” All logic went out the window the moment she found the com-
fort, warmth, and space for her large dining room furniture. It didn’t matter
that the home was next door to a car wash with loud air blowers (fortunately,
my grandmother was hard of hearing). It also didn’t matter that it was about
100 feet from a major street with heavy traffic. It felt right to her, and she
bought it that day.
Good first impressions, feelings, and emotions control the sale, and logic
takes a distant second place in the decision process. For this reason, you
want to ensure that your home makes a good first impression with potential
buyers. In the following sections, I share a few finishing touches that can
make all the difference.
Enhancing the first glance
A home has ten seconds to make a good first impression. All the senses are in
play, and either a home passes or fails the initial test.
Use this advice to positively engage all the senses in the first moments of the
buying experience:
 Scent: Fill the home with smells that invoke feelings of comfort, warmth,
and calmness. Suggest that the sellers bake cookies or bread or some-
thing that fills the home with a warm honeylike aroma prior to presenta-
tions. If your clients aren’t quite Martha Stewart types, suggest that they
put a few drops of vanilla on some aluminum foil in a warm oven. Or,
create a positive aroma with potpourri or incense.
Don’t overdo it with the scents. A scent that is too strong can drive
buyers out of the home before they even get a good look.
 Sound: Play soft, soothing music that is considered pretty-much univer-
sally acceptable, such as classical pieces with limited instruments or
even just piano music. Gangster rap or loud rock would be unadvisable.
If the home has a sound system wired throughout each room, your
music selections also give you an opportunity to demonstrate this fea-
ture of the home.
 Ambiance: Ask the sellers to create a visually inviting environment by
preparing a nicely set dining room table. Suggest that they place small
flower arrangements in various rooms. You may even recommend that
219
Chapter 11: Getting the House Ready for Showing

they build a fire in the fireplace if the home’s for sale during the fall or
winter months.
 Brightness: Open all the blinds and draperies to let in natural light and
make the home appear larger. Also turn on lights in corner areas to 
pull the eye to the perimeter of the room and provide a sense of
expanded space.
Helping the buyer “move in”
When showing property to buyers, your job is to help clients imagine living in
the home. The quicker you can get them thinking about actually moving into
the house, the more quickly you’ll help them make their decision.
The way to help the buyer mentally move in is to ask questions like these:
 Susan, would you arrange your furniture this way?
 Which of these bedrooms would be best for Bobby?
 Where would you place the swing set?
 How would your oval nook table fit in this nook area?
 Where in the garage would you put your workbench?
 Where do you think the big-screen TV could go?
 What do you feel is the best location for your piano?
Any question that engages the buyer’s imagination is a good question. If the
answers convey negative feedback, the home is probably not the right one
for the buyer. After you realize this fact, you can cross if off the list and move
on to another home.
I’ve watched too many agents walk buyers through a home making absurd
comments like, “This is the family room,” as if the client may have mistaken it
for a kitchen. Assume, quite safely, that buyers know which rooms are living
rooms, kitchens, and bedrooms. They don’t need an agent to tell them what’s
what. But, they do need you to help them trigger their imaginations so they
can decide if the rooms are right for them.

M
arketing is the one topic that gets all agents to stop and listen. It’s a
big field that takes time, money, and an almost bewildering number of
decisions. Marketing, as it should be, is high on the To Do list of anyone
trying to make a sale.
I’m willing to bet that most agents spend more time wondering and worrying
about how to market than they spend actually marketing. And the confusion
is well-founded. The choices you face as an agent are practically without
limit, and you have to compete with every other company that markets to
consumers on a daily basis. Hundreds of times each day consumers are inun-
dated with television and radio commercials, newspaper and magazine adver-
tisements, direct mail marketing (including a flood of junk mail), online
marketing (too much of it in the form of spam), outdoor signs, and countless
other marketing messages.
The solution is to focus. Focus on what you want to accomplish, what you
want to communicate, and who you want to reach with your message.
At its core, real estate marketing is simply a matter of communicating a mes-
sage about what you have to an audience that may or may not want what
you’re offering. If that sounds like a simple definition, it’s because marketing
real estate services and products is really not all that complex, as long as you
take a focused approach. In this chapter, I share with you some advice on
how to proceed.

Targeting Your Marketing Message
Agents turn off on the wrong marketing road when they try to take communi-
cation shortcuts by blitzing the market with their ad messages. This route
leads to a dead end for two reasons:
 You don’t have the budget of McDonald’s or Anheuser-Busch, so you
can’t compete well in the mass media environment.
 Your prospective customer is already drowning in daily marketing mes-
sages. Simply lobbing another ad missile into the general market arena
is hardly the way to target the person you’re trying to reach.
Due to the successful efforts of media salespeople, agents get roped into
spending huge sums of money on image- or brand-building marketing cam-
paigns that reach large, untargeted groups of consumers and that produce
zero sales results.
Agents at the top of their games may want to reinforce their dominant market
positions and enhance their strong reputations by shifting some of their mar-
keting dollars into image advertising. But, if you’re an agent just beginning to
ascend the ladder of real estate success, image advertising is not what you
need. At this point in your career, you need to reach highly targeted
prospects with messages about specific offerings that align perfectly with
their interests and needs.
As you plan your marketing communications, think in terms of who, what, and
why: Marketing communications is anything that you mail or e-mail to the gen-
eral public, your sphere of influence, or to the people on your past client list.
You must have a plan and an objective before you slap on that stamp.
 Who is your target audience?
 What are you offering to your target audience?
 Why is the product you’re offering a good fit for the wants, needs, and
purchase abilities of your target audience?
In this section, I help you target your marketing audience, define your prod-
uct, and determine the position your product fills in the marketplace.
Defining your target audience
Before you can choose how you’re going to communicate your message and
what you’re going to say, you need to know who you’re trying to talk to.
222
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

The single biggest mistake in advertising — not just real estate advertising,
but in all advertising — is that marketers create ads without a clear concept
of the people they’re trying to influence. As a result, they use the wrong
media, say the wrong things, and fail to inspire the right outcome.
Before you risk a similar mistake, begin by answering these questions:
 Who are you trying to reach with this particular message? Be specific:
What age and what income level and where do members of this group
currently live?
 Will this message be going to people you know? If so, it can (and
should) be more personal than an ad reaching brand-new prospects.
People that already know you will most likely be the ones to consider
doing business with you. Move them toward action by stressing your
results and professional credentials while also conveying the benefits
and features of the offer you’re presenting.
 Is this marketing message targeted to specific buyer groups, such as
first-time homebuyers, empty nesters, second home purchasers, or
investors? If so, you need to focus your message toward the interests,
needs, and motivations of that specific group.
 Is the market for this message comprised largely of consumers in a
specific age group or generational demographic? If so, decide whether
the offering you’re promoting will be of primary interest to one of the fol-
lowing groups of consumers:
• The senior generation, whose members are now 65 years old 
and over
• Baby boomers born into Western societies post-World War II
between the years of 1946 and 1964
• The post baby-boom generation born between the mid-1960s and
early 1980s, who are sometimes referred to as Generation X or
Generation Next
• People born between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, labeled by mar-
keters as Generation Y, the Echo Boom, or the Millennial Group
The prospects in the older generations still remember the Great
Depression, World War II, Kennedy’s assassination, man landing on the
moon, and Watergate. Younger audiences have never known a world
without MTV, cell phones, and the Internet. Obviously, you’ll want to
develop different messages and choose different media approaches to
reach each group.
The National Association of Realtors (www.realtor.org) and most of
the large real estate companies have conducted extensive research to
define how the prospects in each of the various generational groups
223
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

relate to real estate marketing, sales, and servicing. Training courses on
this topic are ongoing. Watch for one, enroll, and invest a few dollars and
a few hours to refine the strategies and tactics you use with consumers
in each of these generational age groups.
Positioning your offering
In today’s cluttered marketing environment, consumers are trained to tune
out messages that don’t seem to address their real and unfulfilled wants and
needs. In other words, if your message doesn’t clearly deliver a solution to
your prospect’s exact problem — if it doesn’t position itself into an open slot
in your prospect’s mind — then your efforts, dollars, and time will go down
the marketing drain.
Positioning is the marketing art of knowing what available space or position
you and your offering fill in the market and then getting that message to
exactly the people who want what you’re offering.
By first figuring out the position your offering fills, you can easily decide who
you want to talk to, what you want to say, and what marketing vehicles —
from advertising to direct mail to online to personal calls — you need to use
to reach the people you’re targeting.
Positioning the property you’re selling
Understanding your product position can make the difference between reach-
ing your prospect and not, between motivating interest and action and not,
and between making a sale and not.
In real estate, price is the cornerstone of positioning. In my experience, 85
percent of your marketing strategy is set during the listing presentation when
you and the seller agree on the right price and, therefore, the right market
position for their home.
After you’ve worked with a seller to agree on the right listing price, your mar-
keting strategy unfolds naturally following these steps:
 Creating a description of the home’s likely buyer
 Listing the home’s benefits and the reasons why likely buyers won’t
want to let the home go to anyone else
 Selecting media channels or communications approaches that are most
apt to get your marketing message in front of your target audience of
likely buyers
224
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Knowing your product position and the nature of your likely buyer puts you
in a better position to select the right media vehicles to carry your message
to your market. Consider the following generalities in your planning:
 If you’re marketing a lower-end home in your marketplace, many of
your prospects may not be technologically savvy. With limited resources,
they probably haven’t invested in computers or included Internet con-
nections to their monthly budgets. Therefore, you probably won’t want
to weight your marketing efforts toward online ads that your prospects
may never encounter. You’d be better off placing ads in penny-saver or
nickel-ad publications that are readily available for free pickup. One seg-
ment of these buyers that is tech savvy is the first-time homebuyer cate-
gory. Young professionals can also fit into this category. You may often
find them stretching out of this bracket into the next or at least to the
upper end of the bracket.
 If you’re marketing a home in the mid-price range, you can be fairly
confident that your prospects are searching for properties online.
Studies show that 80 percent to 90 percent of middle-income home shop-
pers have Internet access and that most make the Internet their home-
shopping starting point. To reach this audience, an effective Internet
marketing strategy is essential. See the upcoming section, “Spreading
the Word Online,” for more details on Internet marketing strategies.
 If you’re marketing a high-priced home, one-to-one communications
may be the most effective tactic. Especially with one-of-a-kind, top-priced
properties, you may find that mailing a high-quality brochure to care-
fully selected prospects nets the greatest success. Likely buyers for a
property in this market position are likely too busy to spend hours on
the Internet or poring through print ads.
225
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print
Using positioning to your competitive 
sales advantage
Take time to look inside some of the other
homes that compete for the same product posi-
tion as your listing in terms of price and location.
See how their features and benefits compare.
Especially when handling ad and sign calls, 
this comparative information will be valuable in
two ways:
 By expressing with certainty your listing’s
benefits compared to the benefits of other
available properties, you’ll convince callers
that they must see and consider the home.
 By offering information on other homes in
addition to the one you’ve listed, you’ll
increase the odds of converting callers into
buyer clients by establishing yourself as a
skilled agent and valuable home-buying
resource.

Product positioning only works if the home you’re selling is priced appropri-
ately. If you give in to a seller’s desire to set an unreasonably high listing
price, your marketing task will be vastly more difficult because
 You’ll be forced to market to the wrong audience. In order to reach
buyers who can afford the price the seller is asking, you’ll be talking to
people seeking a higher-level home than the property you’re offering.
 Your product will lose in competitive comparisons. It won’t take long
for buyers to realize that the home you’re offering is inferior to others
they can buy with the same amount of money.
When you list an overpriced property, you have only two hopes for success:
that the marketplace will heat up dramatically and lead to escalating prices,
which brings your listing price in line with others, or that your seller will
agree to a rapid price reduction.
Positioning yourself
Contrary to the opinions of consumers and a good many agents, not all
agents offer the same or even similar services. It’s safe to say that all agents
work to bring real estate transactions to successful closings, but from there
the differences in approach, style, and effectiveness vary wildly.
As the owner of a real estate business, you must help prospects and clients
realize the unique and beneficial position you hold in the marketplace.
People need to know clearly why they should hire you. Chapter 14 is full of
information that helps you define and claim your market position. As you
communicate your position through your marketing efforts, remember these
three points:
 Tell and remind people that you’re in the real estate business. After
your business achieves a high level of success, people will contact you
based on your reputation. As a newer agent, however, you must notify
everyone you know that you’re in real estate sales, and then you must
keep reminding them at regular intervals.
 Say and prove that you’re good at what you do. In a service business
where all choices cost basically the same amount of money, as is the
case in real estate sales, agents must differentiate themselves based on
the expertise and service quality they provide. Client success stories,
references from past clients, presentation of statistical advantages,
results of satisfaction surveys, and glowing testimonials break you free
from the crowd.
 Remind consumers that their choice of agent matters. Agents need to
band together to get this message into the minds of all real estate buyers
and sellers. Agents as a whole in the real estate industry haven’t con-
vinced clients that the right agent makes a difference in terms of down
226
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

payment, sales price, purchase price, net equity at closing, ease of trans-
action, level of satisfaction, after-sale service, and countless other bene-
fits. Make it your job to convey to the public that the right agent makes 
a difference, and that you’re the best agent to make a difference in 
their deal.
Creating and Placing High-Impact Ads
Successful real estate advertising is the result of doing three things right:
 Creating ads that grab your target prospects’ attention
 Saying the right things to generate interest, prompt responses, and
move the prospect closer to the buying decision
 Placing your ads in publications that reach your target prospects
These techniques work well with both print and online ad strategies. Read on
for advice.
The power of a great headline
Great marketing materials start with great headlines. Whether you’re creating
a print ad, a property flyer, a Web page, or a brochure, the headline that 
sits above your copy can make or break your communication effort, and
here’s why:
 Four out of five people read nothing but the headline.
 Only the most compelling headlines tempt readers to discover more by
reading further down into your ad copy.
 You can write amazing ad copy, but if your headline is weak, 80 percent
of people will pass right over your ad.
The objective of a headline is to be provocative and to get the reader to pick
up the phone. Here are a few examples of powerful headlines:
!!! My Pain Is YOUR Gain!!!
!!! No Bank Qualifying, Easy Financing, Owner Will Carry with possible Rent-
to-own.

Some of you may be asking why I’m using so much punctuation in improper
places. If I was writing an English paper, this improper punctuation would be
a problem, but in real estate ads, it’s not. The first call I got when I published
these ads was from my mother who is a former English teacher. She was not
happy with her son publicly demonstrating such poor English composition. I
explained to her the purpose of the punctuation overkill was twofold.
Excessive punctuation is important because ads placed in newspapers or on
the Internet are usually set up alphabetically by headline. If you start your
headline with “Zillion Dollar Value,” your ad will most likely be the last one. If
you start your ad with a headline such as “A1-Class Home,” your ad will be
one of the first. However, if you start it with punctuation you’re almost guar-
anteed the first spot in that section. Your ads are more likely to get read and
achieve a higher response rate when they’re at the beginning of the section
rather than at the end.
By using extra punctuation, you also cause the reader to pause and linger on
the sentence. Many direct response studies have concluded that these types
of ad headlines create high response rates from readers.
Writing high-impact advertising copy
The body of the ad, called ad copy, is the descriptive part of the ad. When
preparing copy you want to remember a few essential points. Read on for
details.
Engaging the reader’s imagination
Let readers imagine what it would be like to live in the home. For example,
instead of factually stating that a home has a patio and large backyard, say
that the large back-yard includes a spacious patio designed for perfect
summer evenings. Or, suggest that owners can “BBQ on the spacious patio
while watching the kids play in the enormous backyard.”
In newspaper ads, where you’re paying by the word or inch, you need to limit
the number of words you use. However, you can still pick one powerful fea-
ture to describe in terms that evoke a compelling owner experience.
Emphasizing benefits versus features
A large kitchen, a spacious backyard, a three-car garage, and air conditioning
are all descriptions of a home’s features. Not one of these descriptions tells
buyers what’s in it for them. Not one conveys a benefit that the buyer 
gets from the feature. However, these terms fill most real estate marketing
communications.
228
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Add impact to your ads by converting features to benefits by following these
examples:
 Instead of simply announcing the feature of a three-car garage, advertise
a three-bay garage with abundant storage space. Note in the ad that this
feature makes a rental storage unit (with the accompanying $750 annual
fee) a thing of the past and provides a workshop where the owner can
fix kids’ bikes and perfect shop skills.
 Translate the feature of air conditioning into the benefits of comfort,
coolness, and the restful feeling that results from a good night’s sleep in
an air-conditioned home.
Calling for action . . . now!
What distinguishes great marketers from good marketers is the ability to
build a sense of urgency and to prompt prospects to take immediate action.
Every time you create an ad, give readers a reason to take action and provide
instructions on how to take the next step.
Describe the exclusive nature of a property and say that this type of unique
home rarely comes onto the market and that when it does, it generally moves
quickly. Make sure you prompt prospects to call for an appointment.
You can use low inventory levels or rising interest rates to urge quick action
and phone calls. Even a simple closing line that reads, “Don’t delay, call right
away” can spur more action than an ad that ends without a similar instruction.
Staying legal
When they’re marketing properties, agents can run into trouble by using
terms or descriptive language that violates the Federal Fair Housing Laws
that govern the sale or rental of properties to individuals. These laws fall
under the jurisdiction of HUD, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which is very serious about the ethical and honest treatment
of all real estate consumers.
The fair housing anti-discrimination stance applies to all public communica-
tions, including advertising. All of the text on Web sites, in newspaper and maga-
zine ads, on flyers, or in other printed materials must adhere to HUD guidelines.
Following are a few words and phrases, which are used in everyday conversa-
tions and are considered normal real estate jargon, that can’t be used in print
advertising. The moment these terms appear in printed marketing materials,
the ad is in violation of federal law:
 Able-bodied
 Adult community
229
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

 Adult living
 Bachelor pad
 Churches nearby
 Couple
 Couples only
 Empty nesters
 Any ethnic references
 Families
 Newlyweds
 Traditional neighborhood
Ask your broker or your newspaper-advertising representative for a list of the
prohibited words. Many newspaper reps are in tune with the housing laws
and will correct your ads to make them comply. However, when in doubt, the
safest advice is to restrict ad copy to a description of the property for sale
while steering far clear of any descriptions of the type of person or people
that you or the sellers think would be good buyers or occupants.
Discrimination in housing because of race or color, national origin, religion,
sex, family status, or handicap is illegal for both real estate agents and sellers
and carries stiff penalties and fines. If you think that a seller is discriminating,
run, don’t walk, away. For complete information, visit the Fair Housing Web
site at www.fairhousinglaw.org/.
Choosing the right media outlets
You can create the most extraordinary ad possible, but if it reaches the eyes
or ears of people who aren’t interested in or capable of buying your offering,
your efforts are wasted. That’s why media selection is so essential to effec-
tive real estate marketing.
For example, suppose that you have a listing for a home that has specially built
wheelchair access, an elevator, and is on a golf course. You’ll find very few
people out there who are golfers, who have the need for wheelchair accessibil-
ity, and who have the assets required to buy a home with an elevator. If you
place your ad in a publication that predominantly reaches 20-somethings who
are starting new families, you can bank on little to no response to your efforts.
On the other hand, if you place your advertisement in golf publications, or if
the golf course is private and you advertise in the monthly newsletter or send
direct mailers to the membership list, your marketing messages immediately
230
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

reach the prospects in your target audience. Even better, if you were to dis-
cover a magazine with a good many handicapped golfers among its sub-
scribers, you could safely bet your advertising dollars on the publication to
serve as an ideal vehicle for sharing the targeted benefits of your listed prop-
erty with the perfect target audience for this home.
The key to effective media placements is to know the following:
 The profile of the target prospect you’re trying to reach, including the
prospect’s geographic location, demographic facts (which includes age,
gender, ethnicity, income level, education level, marital status, house-
hold size, and other facts), and lifestyle characteristics, which includes
personal interests and activities, behavioral patterns, and beliefs.
 How well the media vehicle you’re considering reaches your target
audience. If you’re targeting families that have young children and have
income levels of $75,000 or more, ask the media representative what per-
centage of the publication’s audience matches that description. The
answer can help you determine whether an ad in that publication would
be effective.
Converting ad interest to action
Your ads need to include a response mechanism, which is a fancy way of
saying that you need to tell people what to do next and how to do it. Every
single communication — whether through an ad, a mailer, a Web site visit, an
open house, or any other outreach effort — needs to include a call to action
that motivates prospects to take the next step. One call to action is having
prospects provide you with an e-mail address, a home or work mailing
address, a phone number, or some other way that you can be in contact.
To generate responses and harvest prospect information, consider the fol-
lowing ideas:
 Invite ad respondents to call or go online to request free reports on
such attention-getting topics as “Ten Mistakes Sellers Make When Selling
a Home” or “Ten Tips for Buying Property under Market Value.” You’ll
gain names and mailing addresses as a result.
 Use call capture technology to harvest information on prospects who
request information about properties you’ve listed or are featuring in
your marketing. Call capture allows you to promote a toll-free number
that prospects can call for prerecorded information on a property. When
they do, the technology grabs the caller’s phone number and sends it to
you within minutes so that you can call them back. It’s truly a brilliant
innovation for lead generation. For more information, visit the www.

Promoting Properties by Using Flyers
Agents have made promotional flyers a marketing staple for years and years,
and their use is still valid today. What has changed over the years is the way
flyers are designed and produced.
Today, instead of using flyers simply to promote listings, agents use flyers to
promote their personal brands. In addition to presenting information on the
home being promoted, agents prominently present their own brand images —
in the form of logos, pictures, slogans or taglines, and contact information.
Most importantly, they include their Web site addresses in an effort to use
property flyers as a mechanism to drive traffic to agent sites.
Creating outside-the-home flyers
When creating flyers that sit in yard boxes outside of homes for sale, follow
this advice:
 Include property basics, such as age of the home, square footage,
number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and a few amenities that make the
home special.
 List a few amenities that make the home special, but don’t divulge all the
details. Remember, the purpose of the flyer is to entice prospects to call
you for a showing appointment. You want your phone to ring. However,
the more information you share, the greater the chance that prospects
will cross the home off their consideration list before they ever call you
to get inside.
 Include the address of the property and a picture of the home’s exterior.
This way, when the prospects get home after looking at a half dozen or
so properties they can keep your listing straight from the others they
may be considering.
 Include your contact information, company information, Web and e-mail
addresses, and a picture of yourself to advance your brand and drive
traffic to your business.
 You may also consider including the listing’s MLS number. If prospects
are working with an agent, their agent won’t have to call you and waste
your time to provide information that is available on the MLS.
 Consider using the back of the flyer to present one paragraph each on
five or six other properties listed by you or others in your office that are
similar to the home featured on the flyer front. These profiles won’t be
as extensive or descriptive as the information presented on the featured
home, but they’ll give prospects a lineup of additional reasons to call you
for additional information. Your objective is to increase the odds of receiv-
ing a call or a number of calls for each flyer that goes out of your flyer box.
232
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Creating inside-the-home flyers
The flyers that you hand out inside the home at open houses or home tours
are similar to the outdoor flyer with these variations:
 Inside-the-home flyers include a full description of the home’s amenities
rather than a partial list of amenity highlights.
 Include more photos so that following the home tour prospects can
recall their favorite features.
 Feature the price.
Most buyers tour a number of homes in a short period of time. The purpose
of the indoor flyer is to provide complete information that jogs memories
after prospects leave a showing.
Design and production tips
Creating flyers from scratch each time you have a listing is far too consuming
of an agent’s time. To save hours while also creating better materials, use
flyer templates to speed up the process. You can use ready-made templates
that are available for use by real estate professionals, or you can create your
own personalized templates to use over and over again.
Available software resources for easy-to-personalize home flyers include
ProFlyers, Real Estate Marketing Flyers, and ProForce Software, all currently
available at prices under $130.
Many real estate-specific customer relationship management, or CRM pro-
grams, such as Instant Impact Gold, TOP PRODUCER, and AgentOffice,
include templates to create customized flyers as part of their software 
packages. So, before buying new programs, check to see what functions are
included in the software you already own.
233
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print
What about including the price?
Whether or not to include the listing price on the
yard box flyer is an issue that raises a heated
debate in the agent community. The agents who
advocate including the dollar figure say that if
you don’t include the price, you’ll upset some
prospects by providing everything but the
number they most want to know. However, you’ll
receive more calls, and the chance to develop
more leads, if you leave the price off the flyer.
You’re in the business of selling real estate. If
you state the price and it causes prospects to
cross the home off their list without ever calling
you for more information, you won’t have a
chance to sell anything. Neither you nor your
seller will benefit if prospects take a flyer and
never call you.

Spreading the Word Online
Over the past decade, the Internet has revolutionized real estate marketing
approaches. Ten years ago the primary mechanism for advertising properties
was the local newspaper. Not so today. Over recent years, the newspaper’s
classified section has shrunk dramatically while the number of agent Web
sites has exploded, and for good reason. Agents are going where their
prospects are, and their prospects are online.
Today, with more than 80 percent of consumers using the Internet to view
properties, presence, prominence, and promotion on the Web are essential to
your success. The upcoming sections help you to develop online presence
and devise an online strategy that accomplishes three aims: brand building,
information distribution, and lead generation.
Types of agent Web sites
You can create a single site that aims to build your brand, distribute listing
information, and generate leads, but the most successful sites are targeted to
specific audiences and interests, as described in the upcoming sections.
Brand-building sites
The aim of brand-building sites is to enhance your credibility and stature in
the marketplace. They feature information about your success in the busi-
ness by showing the number of units you’ve sold, the number of years of
experience you have, the designations you’ve achieved, and the awards
you’ve received. They also feature testimonials from past clients who have
worked with you.
Information-distribution sites
Information-distribution sites present information about neighborhoods,
schools, housing areas, and specific properties. Consumers visit information-
distribution sites to find out about the houses for sale in their area. For that
reason, the sites need to include search functions that are easy for consumers
to use. To increase your success, information-distribution sites should also
include at least a minimal level of lead-harvesting ability. As an agent, you
want to be able to get your prospects’ contact information so that you can
provide service follow-up.
When it comes to the topic of lead generating and lead harvesting, agents split
into two schools of thought. Some advocate setting a low barrier of entry to
an information-distribution site — which means a user has to input only a
234
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

little information before entering the site. Setting a low barrier of entry encour-
ages the greatest number of people possible to enter the site. On the other
hand, some agents prefer to set the entry bar higher, requiring a greater
amount of information, including name, address, and phone number, so that
the prospects who gain access to information also enter the agent’s prospect
information base.
I personally prefer the higher barrier of entry approach. Opponents to this
approach are right that it delivers fewer leads, but the leads you gather are of
higher quality. Plus, you’ll collect complete prospect information, enabling
you to stream site visitors into your usual sales channel. By requiring your
site visitor’s name and phone number, you’ll gather the information you need
to follow-up with a phone call and seek an appointment. The alternative is to
obtain only an e-mail address. However, building connection, urgency, and a
call to action in the text of an e-mail is much more difficult than it is through
a personal phone call.
Lead-generation sites
Lead-generation sites attract prospects through links, banner ads, and offers
of free reports and articles that appear on other Web sites.
If you’re a newer agent with limited cash resources, or if you lack polished tech-
nological skills, build your lead-generation site using an existing site template
instead of trying to design and create a custom-designed site. Most templates
include areas for your personalized copy and content and opportunities to cus-
tomize the look so your site won’t look like a carbon copy of another agent’s.
Attributes of a good site
One site attribute overshadows all others: accessibility. Your site must be
easy to use. Many agents mistakenly create sites that are pretty but not 
user-friendly.
Before you commit to a site template or design, make sure it can achieve the
following standards:
 The information is clearly presented and well-organized so that visitors
can quickly find and get to site sections and content.
 The site loads quickly. No one wants to wait 30 seconds for a site to
load. Your site should load within a few seconds.
 The site is easy to navigate so that users can move from section to sec-
tion without confusion.
235
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

 The site gives you the opportunity to categorize prospects into buyer
and seller groups, and possibly by price point as well. After your site is
online, you want to quickly lead users to the information they seek, and
you want to know the nature of the visitor you’re serving.
 The focus of the site is on the properties you offer. Online real estate
shoppers are looking for homes, and your site needs to give them what
they want or they’ll bail out in a matter of seconds. The show is not
about you, but instead about the homes you represent and about the
homes you can access through the MLS. Anything that takes the focus
away from the properties is a costly distraction.
More than anything else, you want your Web site to create and harvest leads.
To enhance user responses, consider making an offer of value, perhaps in the
form free reports for buyers and sellers. Don’t create a Web site that is only a
glorified electronic business card. If you do, you won’t get the results you’re
hoping for.
Creating domain names
Your domain name is the key that drives traffic to your site. If you don’t already
have a domain name, follow these steps to get one — or several — as quickly
as possible:
 The first domain name you need to register is your own name, as in
www.yourname.com/. I recommend that you go to www.godaddy.com/
to determine whether your name is available, and then register it as
your domain name. The site is an easy and cost-effective resource, cur-
rently charging only $8.95 a year for your domain name and a lineup of
other complimentary services.
 Consider registering a number of additional domain names that all lead
to your Web site through a function called URL forwarding, which redi-
rects multiple Web address to one site. You could have 100 URLs that
forward to just one site. At $8.95 per year, cost shouldn’t be a deterrent.
In addition to your original domain name, you can create some names
that describe your service area. For instance, you may want to register a
domain name that features your hometown name followed by the words
real estate or homes for sale, following these examples:
www.anywhereusarealestate.com/
www.anywhereusahomesforsale.com/
Or, you can put your own name in front of your hometown name, follow-
ing this example:
www.dirksellsbend.com/
236
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

 You can even register domain names that feature the names of specific
real estate areas or neighborhoods in your market. For example, if you
specialize in a hypothetical region called Perfectville, you may register:
www.perfectvillehomesforsale.com/
www.movetoperfectville.com/
www.perfectvillesubdivision.com/
When you use a multiple domain name strategy, you invest in a single Web
site that carries your primary domain name and then use a number of names
to get people to your Web space.
When online real estate shoppers enter the name of your hometown or the
name of a special neighborhood in your hometown, chances are good that
one of your domain names will appear in their search results.
Driving traffic to your site
Unfortunately online, you can’t rely on the old saying, “Build it and they will
come.” You need to drive people to your site by doing the following:
 Feature your Web address on every mailer, ad, flyer, or promotional
piece you send into the marketplace. You may even consider adding
your Web address to your yard signs.
 Put search engines to work. Search engine optimization is a complex
field that usually requires professional assistance. Most agents don’t
understand the language and strategy required to move their sites up
high in online search results. Luckily, a whole industry of technology
propeller heads does. Before hiring anyone, check out the abilities of the
person you’re considering. Ask to see hard data regarding the results
she has achieved for other clients, including ranking stats, page views,
and lead generation numbers.
If the person you’re interviewing reports success rates by citing the
number of hits, beware. Often people refer to hits when they don’t have
positive results in the other areas or when they haven’t tracked the
results. You only want to pay for results you can measure.
Converting lookers to leads
Site visitors are known as eyeballs. The aim of your online strategy is to con-
vert eyeballs to leads by creating and promoting a clear path they can follow
from your Web page to your business.
237
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

You’ll never turn every online visitor to a lead, but you can increase your con-
version rate dramatically by presenting an effective call to action. These calls
to action can be in the form of a specific request for a free report, an offer to
request additional property information, or an invitation to fill out a survey.
After you present these calls to action, track the number of lookers you con-
vert to leads. For example, if a thousand users visit your site and 150 request
a free brochure titled “How to buy property in our market for 70 cents on the
dollar,” your conversion rate is 15 percent. Not bad!
Converting leads to clients
After you capture a lead, you need to go into full court press to convert the
name and contact information into a prospect for your business. For some
reason, agents don’t follow up with Internet leads as aggressively as they do
with ad call or sign call leads. I consider this a mistake because in today’s
world you stand to generate more leads online than from any other source.
To get a feel for the way online leads accrue to build your business, look at
this follow-up to the example in the preceding section:
 If your site draws 1,000 visitors and 150 of those visitors request your
free report, you’ll have a 15 percent visitor-to-lead conversion ratio.
 If you convert 5 percent of the resulting 150 leads to buyer-consultation
interviews, you’ll generate 7.5 interviews from the 1,000 site visitors, or
a .75 percent site visitor-to-interview conversion rate.
 Based on your online conversion rates, you’ll have a base from which to
work with as you adjust your marketing and conversion strategy. For
instance, if you want to generate 15 instead of 7.5 interviews, you’ll have
to either double the number of visitors to your site or double your con-
version rate. It all boils down to the numbers.
To improve your Web marketing, visit other agents’ sites to see how they build,
use, market, promote, and track responses. Most importantly, observe how the
other agents prompt calls to action. You may even register and request a few
offered items to see how they follow-up on leads. Most use automatic respon-
ders, which send out messages via e-mail without the touch of a human hand,
so they won’t even know that you, a competing agent, got their stuff.
Using Realtor.com
Realtor.com attracts more home buyer and home seller visits than any other
Web site. Owned by the National Association of Realtors, this site helps
238
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

member agents promote their offerings to the public. As a first step, visit
www.realtor.com/ to explore the different packages and features available.
Then make sure to post all of your listings, along with multiple pictures, on
the site.
Amazingly, at times, fewer than half of the site’s listings feature even a single
picture. What a mistake, especially given the fact that most consumers imme-
diately abandon interest in properties if they can’t see at least one picture.
To further increase exposure for your listings, you may even want to include
a link to a virtual tour. See the upcoming section, “Enhancing Exposure via
Virtual Tours” to get how-to advice.
Putting your agency’s Web site to work
As a newer agent, you may not be able to afford an elaborate site of your
own. Here’s where your company’s site can come to your short-term rescue.
Eventually you have to build your own site, but in the meantime, a page on
your company’s site, with an address such as, www.bananarealestate.com/
dirkzeller, can at least give you online presence.
Whether it’s your only online space or whether it’s in addition to your own site,
be sure to create an agent page on your company Web site. Include your pic-
ture, qualifications, education, designations (if you have any), and degrees. You
may also want to include a personal mission statement or series of service-
based beliefs for prospects to view. Additionally, feature listed properties,
along with as many photos as possible.
Enhancing Exposure via Virtual Tours
The term virtual tour applies to either a video presentation or a series of digi-
tal pictures “stitched” together to create a 360 degree panoramic view of the
living space of a home.
With a virtual tour, a prospect in Nome, Alaska, can go online to experience
the feeling of being inside a home in Palm Desert, California.
When the idea of virtual tours was introduced about a decade or so ago, it
was billed as the home-buying approach of the future. Technology forecast-
ers said that prospects would use virtual tour capabilities to view their
selected home and that they would then simply click to make the purchase.
Obviously, the sales predictions were wildly off course, but the popularity of
virtual tours as a marketing device took off nonetheless.
239
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

At a time when consumers are demanding more information, more pictures,
and a greater ease of access, virtual tours are the fastest-growing innovation
in real estate marketing. Studies of online home shoppers show that homes
accompanied by virtual tours receive more hits, higher page views, and
longer view times per page than homes featured in only a few grainy pictures.
Virtual tours help your property get noticed.
Be sure that your listing is ready to show and that it competes well in its
competitive environment before posting a virtual tour or the tour can back-
fire on you and drive interest away. If your listing pales in comparison to
competitive offerings, you won’t get anyone into the home. Flip to Chapter 11
for advice on how to get a listing ready for showing.
Producing a virtual tour
Whether your tour takes the form of video or stitched-together digital
photos, my advice is “don’t try this at home” unless you’re willing to invest in
some sophisticated equipment and training. Either way, consider this advice:
 Be prepared to invest some money. You can piece together provided
photos for practically nothing, but to produce a true virtual tour with a
360-degree visual presentation, you’ll need to spend at least several hun-
dred dollars per tour.
 To create your own video tours, you need the right equipment. If you
don’t already have video equipment, you can buy a system for under
$1,000. IPIX is the industry leader and is the provider of the equipment
used by the majority of professional producers of 360-degree tours.
Many smaller companies are just resellers of the IPIX equipment.
After the virtual tour is completed, put it to work. Feature it online, show it in
your CMA presentations, use it when working with out-of-area buyers, and
include it in the portfolio you use to present yourself to prospects and FSBO
sellers.
Important questions to ask
Some agents are quick to spend money, even if they don’t have a plan or set
of objectives in place. Along the same lines, if not approached properly, vir-
tual tours can cause agents to spend hundreds of dollars, without much
return, for each of their listings. Each time you produce a tour, begin by
answering these questions:
 What is your objective for the tour? Will you use it to generate leads,
close appointments, build your image as a real estate agent, or for some
other purpose?
240
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

 Who is your target audience? Will the tour be shown primarily to low-
end, mid-range, or high-end home buyers? The answer will help you
match the presentation to audience expectations, and will help you
arrive at your budget as well.
 What type of tour do you want to produce? Choose either 360-degree
video or digital photos.
 How much time and effort can you and your staff invest in producing
and maintaining the tour? Be aware that to produce your own 360-
degree video tours, you’ll need at least one in-house camera expert and
one person to upload, create, and maintain the tours.
 Will you hire a professional company? If so, be prepared to interview
firms and compare resources based on company costs, the caliber of
solutions the company provides, the way its services match your needs
and expectations, and how easy the employees are to work with.
Mistakes to avoid
The biggest mistake you can make is to try to create virtual tours on the cheap.
If you attempt to create your own virtual tours, chances are good that they,
and by association you, will look cheap. They’ll look cheap to potential
buyers, potential sellers, and potential leads and prospects who will see your
work online from around the world.
The quality of the production will be interpreted as an indication of the qual-
ity of your character and your service. Aim high.
Resources
Whether you’re planning to do it yourself or planning to hire professionals, the
resources available are practically countless. Recently, I searched for the term
“Virtual Tour” with an online search engine and 2,800,000 hits popped up.
Following are a few Web sites you may want to consider:
 FlyInside.com (www.flyinside.com): This site provides a free digital
slide show with audio capability. It delivers a pretty nice, but basic prod-
uct. However, this site doesn’t have enough bells and whistles for use
with million dollar homes.
 ImageMaker360.com (www.imagemaker360.com): This group produces
the Cadillac of virtual tours. It provides every feature imaginable from
360-degree viewing with enhanced audio to interactive floor plans, traffic
analysis, open house features, and countless other options. This com-
pany is top of the line in terms of price, as well. But, if money is not a
worry for you, this Web site may be a good bet.
241
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

 RealTourVision.com (www.realtourvision.com): You’ll need your
own equipment for this option, but it does offer a 360-degree solution.
 VisualTour.com (www.visualtour.com): This company is probably the
largest player in the virtual tour industry. For a reasonable upfront fee
and monthly rate, this company produces a digital slide show with your
photos “stitched” together to simulate a 360-degree view.
Leading prospects to your virtual tour
To drive prospects to your virtual tour, use these promotional channels:
 When you produce outside-the-home flyers, include your Web address
and virtual tour information.
 Include a virtual tour link on the MLS.
 Arrange links or connectors from other sites that attract visitors who
match your target prospect profile. This approach is especially effective
in hot resort market areas where visitors are looking for in-depth
regional information.
 Feature the site address for your virtual tour in your print ads. Just be
sure that your tour doesn’t reveal the home address. Your aim is to gen-
erate interest so that prospects call you for additional information and
home access.
 Use post cards as direct mailers to promote both the property and the
virtual tour. Don’t send a letter that may or may not be opened. Send a
postcard that automatically makes an immediate visual impression.
A Picture’s Worth a Thousand Words
Thank goodness for digital technology that allows you to e-mail pictures of
homes to prospects far and wide with the simple click of a mouse. The right
picture can heighten interest, prompt purchase decisions, and deliver thou-
sands of dollars in commission income. For that reason, a digital camera and
photography expertise are necessary in your business.
Choosing your camera
Select a digital camera for taking pictures inside and outside the homes
you’re representing. If you’re on a tight budget, you can find a solid camera
for around $200. Just be sure it includes the following features:
242
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

 Point and shoot. Cameras with this function focus and adjust for available
lighting. They’re easy to use, and therefore you’re likely to use them often.
 A reasonable number of mega pixels. Mega pixels determine photo res-
olution, which is essentially image quality. The bad news is that the
more mega pixels you get, the more money you’ll spend. The good news
is that you don’t want to go overboard because with mega pixels, you
can actually have too much of a good thing. They use storage space in
your camera and in your computer. They also result in larger files that
take longer to e-mail. A camera with 3.1 mega pixels is enough to get the
job done well.
 Easy transfer and storage capability. Select a camera with an easy-to-
use memory card that you can insert into your computer, or select a
model that connects via a USB cable so that you can easily transfer your
images to your computer.
Taking digital photos
The key to success in taking digital pictures is to take a lot of them. With digi-
tal cameras you’re not spending money on film and development, so each
photo is basically free. When you’re at a property, snap freely. You can always
edit, resize, crop, rotate, and enhance your photos with special effects when
you’re back at your computer.
Capturing the best images
For exterior photos:
 Photograph when natural light is abundant. If you live in a climate with
long, dreary winters, you may have to take a first round of photos on a
gray day just to capture an image to use when you announce the listing.
Plan to go back on a brighter day (as soon as possible) to take a second
shot that will replace the original one.
 Position yourself so that the sun is directly behind, or at an angle
behind, your back. Otherwise your photo will have a glare that you may
have to remove during editing.
For interior photos:
 Create shots that give the illusion of spaciousness. Do so by incorpo-
rating transitional areas, such as hallways or entryways, in with rooms
in the same photo.
 Take lots and lots of shots. Don’t edit on the spot or become paralyzed by
second-guessing. Don’t use the camera’s viewing screen to evaluate the
pictures at length. Capture as many images as possible, and then wait until
you download them into your computer to analyze, cull, select, and edit.
243
Chapter 12: Marketing Yourself and Your Properties Online and in Print

Choosing the best shots
The whole point of featuring photos is to entice prospects to come see the
real thing. So, select and use only those images that convey comfort, warmth,
and unique quality, and that are capable of evoking a “wow” response.
If a photo shows a unique aspect of a bedroom, like an angled nook or archi-
tecturally unique wall, use it. If the master bath — always a selling feature —
is well beyond plain Jane in its look, show it. When selecting shots, choose
quality over quantity.
Creating and organizing photo files
Set up a system so you can store and access the images you may need in the
future. Following each photo shoot, first delete the pictures you don’t want to
use, and then store the rest. When storing your pictures, your camera auto-
matically suggests a file name. Rename each picture by choosing a name that
depicts the home or its address. Then move the images into folders that are
labeled by property address.

Negotiating the Contract 
and Closing the Deal
In This Chapter
 Preparing your buyer or seller for the negotiations ahead
 Handling the negotiation process
 Forming an effective closing team to seal the deal
M
ost sellers think that an agent’s real work involves finding the right
buyer, and most buyers think that the agent’s real work involves find-
ing the right house to buy. In fact, the real work involves bringing the deal to
a successful close, and that’s what this chapter is all about.
The public doesn’t see the hurdles an agent must overcome when reaching
contract agreements and closing the transactions, but if that step goes awry,
no other step in the real estate sales process matters. The process of negoti-
ating a transaction involves fiduciary responsibility, market knowledge, client
relations, honesty, disclosure, and enormous skill and tact. Sometimes suc-
cess means your client is the one selected over other interested parties to
buy a particular home. Sometimes success is a negotiated reduction in a
home’s sales price. Always it reflects the realities of the market and the best
terms and conditions the buyer and seller can achieve.
This chapter lays out the rules of negotiating, starting with knowing all about
the market environment so you can convince your client to accept terms and
conditions you believe are the best to be had at the present time, based on cur-
rent market conditions. Often, you have to persuade a less-than-enthusiastic
client who was hoping for a better outcome, so the following sections help you
prepare for the task.

Informing Clients (and Yourself) 
of What Happens Next
At the listing presentation or buyer interview consultation, after the client
commits to a buyer’s agency agreement or listing agreement by signing either
contract, take a few minutes to outline what happens next in the real estate
sales process. Cover the following two points:
 Briefly describe how you’ll work to represent your clients’ interests
when it comes to negotiating and closing their transaction. For example,
I always used this final discussion to explain that my typical approach was
to handle negotiations during an appointment in my office or, as an alter-
native I would fax copies to each party prior to a phone meeting during
which we would review the documents. I found these two approaches to
be most convenient for my clients and most time-efficient for me and for
them. By explaining my process in advance, my clients knew exactly
what to expect.
Some agents still travel to the client’s home to present the offers and
handle negotiations. I found it to be a large investment of time that was
quite unnecessary. I couldn’t have sold 150 homes a year and met all the
clients in their homes to present offers. It would have also created more
time away from family in the evenings — only to accomplish the task that
could be handled well by fax during the course of a normal business day.
 Advise your clients to expect most initial offers to come in below the
asking price. I always told my clients that they should expect a below–list
price offer and that I rarely saw a transaction that didn’t require a coun-
teroffer. This information adjusts expectations and averts disappointment.
Your objective is to set the stage for the negotiations that lie ahead.
Preparing your client for what’s in store is an imperative final step that will
save you time, energy, and even emotion in the future.
Along with being truthful and realistic with clients, great real estate agents
set an optimistic tone and create an expectation that all parties will work
together to achieve a negotiated win/win outcome for both the seller and the
buyer. In addition, the agents for both parties need to feel as though they’ve
won as well, not just in terms of commissions earned but also in terms of feel-
ing that they’ve earned the satisfaction of their clients.
An unbalanced marketplace makes it harder for all parties to feel as if they’ve
won. In recent years, most of North America experienced an unbalanced real
estate environment; the inflated seller’s marketplace left buyers feeling that
they were at a disadvantage in sales transactions. They had to act quickly,
pay more than the asking price, and assume more risks, such as released
earnest money, no inspections on the home, and no contingent sale offers.
246
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Fortunately, we’re exiting that arena and entering back into an environment in
which win/win outcomes are more possible and probable.
One of your jobs throughout the transaction is to serve as a calming influ-
ence. When emotions run high — as they’re sure to do — be the one to
remain focused on the outcome and to settle down the buyer, the seller, and
all involved agents. Take the approach followed by the best emergency room
doctors: They display confidence and skill while reassuring their patients and
other medical staff that everything is under control. If an emergency room
doctor flew into a frenzy, the entire clinical setting would likely spin out of
control on the tide of unchecked emotion. The same is true in the final throes
of a real estate transaction. Commit to serving as the calming influence
throughout the deal.
Keys to Representing a Seller
Sellers have plenty of reason to be emotional during the final negotiation.
They’re undergoing changes, making huge decisions, and dealing with trans-
actions that involve major (if not the most major) investments they own.
Your role in this environment, and the key to your success, is twofold: Be pre-
pared and protect the seller at every step along the way.
Be prepared
Careful preparations before you present a buyer’s offer to your client can
shorten the meeting, help you craft a better counteroffer, keep seller emotions
in check, and focus your client’s attention on the next important steps in the
sales process. Prepare yourself for negotiations by following this advice:
 Remain calm no matter how high or low the offer starts.
 Go through the buyer’s offer carefully and note any key issues that
need addressing.
I rarely advise that the buyer’s representative be present to deliver the
news to the seller directly. In my experience, it only increases the time
invested on my seller’s part (and on my part). My seller could say some-
thing that may weaken their position in negotiating with the buyer that
the agent picks up on.
 Flag any contract points that merit your seller’s attention so you can
easily reference them during the meeting.
If you’re faxing the document to your client, also summarize the key
points on the fax cover sheet so that your seller doesn’t have to dig
through every line of the contract.
247
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

 If your meeting will take place by phone rather in person, fax the
offer to the seller within 15 to 30 minutes of your conversation. You
don’t want the seller to spend hours brooding if the price is low, and you
certainly don’t want him to call you with questions, concerns, and panic
attacks six times prior to the scheduled phone conference.
Protect the seller at all times
The worst thing that can happen to a seller is to have the transaction fall apart
a few days before closing. By then, she’s emotionally invested in another prop-
erty. She’s already made plans to move. She’s excited about the future. And
then, wham, everything falls apart, and everyone loses market time, marketing
momentum, and a considerable investment of time and money.
In the aftermath of this kind of disastrous situation, I’ve had the chance to
look at the contracts that were written and have seen things that make me
cringe. Ultimately, the agent didn’t protect the client, and all parties paid
dearly for the mistake in the end.
Even the most thorough approach results in a broken deal once in a while. By
taking the following precautions, however, you can do a better job of protect-
ing your client and you can keep disasters to a bare minimum:
 Require the prospective buyer to deposit enough earnest money to
secure your client’s position. Set the earnest money high enough to
make it difficult for the buyer to purchase another home if she walks
away from the deal after all contingent conditions are satisfied. You may
be thinking that this advice conflicts with your objective to achieve a
win/win outcome, but in fact, it simply requires the buyer to uphold her
end of the deal or sacrifice her deposit.
Few buyers will walk from a deal when an amount like $5,000 is at stake.
Yet many agents allow initial deposits of as low as $1,000 or $2,000 to
squeak by. The rationale is that the buyer won’t have the cash available
to make a higher deposit; however, if she needs $15,000 to close in 30
days, depositing $5,000 upfront won’t kill her.
Consider accepting part of the deposit in the form of a short-term note,
but only do this if there’s no other way to increase the earnest money. If
the buyer really does have a problem with available cash, get a few thou-
sand dollars deposited immediately and make arrangements to receive
the balance within a few weeks, securing the latter portion with a note.
Never secure the initial earnest money with a note for more than 24
hours, and if you accept a note for additional earnest money, be sure it’s
redeemed within a stipulated short period of time.
Don’t accept notes redeemable at closing. If the closing never happens,
your seller will never be able to redeem the note. It becomes a worthless
248
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

piece of paper because the transaction never closed and, technically,
the note never came due. Even legal action can’t fix this agent mishap.
 Require the buyer to provide proof of loan approval with no conditions.
You want proof-positive that the buyer can and will perform within two
weeks of acceptance of the offer. Lending institutions are notorious for
writing loan approval letters with conditions or clauses that protect both
the institution and the buyer, so make it clear on the counteroffer that no
contingencies or conditions are acceptable after two weeks.
 Tighten the language of the deal every step of the way. Remember at all
times that your job is to protect and secure the interests of your client,
the seller. The broader the language you allow, the greater the number of
interpretable clauses — commonly known as weasel clauses — that make
it into the transaction, each one endangering the level of security you can
provide your client.
Keys to Representing a Buyer
The buyer’s agent is responsible for crafting, presenting, writing a proper
contract for, and prompting acceptance of a good offer. In order to best repre-
sent your client, the buyer, follow these recommendations:
 Guide your client toward a competitive offer. Perform at least a quick
competitive market analysis, or CMA, to determine the value of the prop-
erty. (If you need help with this task, turn to Chapter 10.) Among the 
factors to weigh are the home’s current value based on the value of com-
parable properties, regional housing inventory levels, and the competi-
tive nature of the current marketplace. Your findings help your client
arrive at a reasonable price decision and help you to counsel him as he
makes a competitive offer.
 After your client decides on a competitive offer, properly prepare the
contract you will present on his behalf to the seller. Your goal must be
to protect your client by writing terms and conditions that convey his
intentions and meet his goals. Work with your client to understand all the
terms and conditions that the contract covers and the language you use.
For most people, a home purchase represents the largest investment
they make, the biggest purchase in their lives, the greatest and longest-
lasting debt they assume. The purchase agreement you write must pro-
tect them by addressing every issue: the price being offered, the items
to be included in the purchase price, the amount to be deposited, the
closing date, the date the offer becomes null and void, and any condition
that accompanies the offer, including contingencies based on the out-
come of inspections, approval of financing, and personal property trans-
ferring with the sale or other issues.
249
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

 Present the offer and your buyer to the seller as the best in the mar-
ketplace. Presenting the offer favorably to the seller can mean the differ-
ence between your client or other bidders buying the house. The
stronger you can position your buyer by presenting his financial capac-
ity, superior commitment, motivation, and human connection, the more
you swing the negotiation in favor of your client.
For some sellers, a human connection is the tipping point in choosing
one buyer over others. For example, an offer from a family the seller
imagines will create cherished memories in the home may trump
another offer that’s missing the human connection, even if the former
results in equal or even slightly less money.
Partnering with the Other Agent
Whether you represent the seller or buyer, you and the other agent in your
transaction are obligated to cooperate with each other; that’s why you’re
called co-op brokers. At the same time, you’re both obligated to represent the
interests of your own clients, which works wonderfully when you both seek a
win/win outcome but can be troublesome when the other agent comes to the
deal with a we win/you lose mentality.
Before talking with the other agent at length, I suggest you do some home-
work. I always made it a point to find out in advance all I could about the
agent I’d be dealing with. Unless I already knew the agent personally, my staff
would conduct some research. They’d start at the MLS computer where
they’d look at the number of listings and sales the agent had completed over
the last few years. This information provided an indication of the agent’s
experience, which enabled me to better define my role in the negotiation. For
example, if the other agent is experienced, successful, and skilled, I’d expect
to share power equally. If the other agent was very new to the field, however,
I knew I’d have to take the lead and guide the negotiation along.
250
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 
Become your own “other agent”
The easiest other agent to work with is you. You
know you. You know you want win/win out-
comes. You know whether your listing has
padding or your purchase offer has room for
negotiation. You know how you work and that
your skills are up to the task. And you probably
know it’s easier for you to work with you than
with any other agent.
Make your real estate sales life easier by selling
more of your own listings. Represent both the
buyer and the seller to avoid the challenges of
working with another agent to complete the
transaction.
The biggest bonus of being both agents is that
you don’t have to split fees and earn more for
the sale!

When you’re ready to talk with the other agent, do the following:
 Explain your desire to create a win/win transaction. Tell the other
agent that you’re counting on him to create a win for both the buyer and
seller and that you intend to do the same. Broaching this topic should
help you identify an agent who believes his job is to achieve a win only
for his own client.
 If you’re the listing agent, let the other agent know that the home is
competitively priced at fair market value with no padding in the
asking price. If your client counters a low offer at full price or close to it,
the response won’t be a surprise to the agent or prospective buyers.
 If you reach a snag, challenge, or impasse with the other agent or with
the agent’s client, test the situation by asking the agent one of these
questions:
• “If you were representing my client, would you counsel him to
accept this offer?”
• “If you were in my shoes, would you want your client to accept
these terms and conditions?”
If the answer to either question is yes, ask “Why?” or “How would you sell
this to my clients if you were in my shoes?” If the agent can’t give you an
answer, the silence lets you know that he knows his client’s offer is unrea-
sonable. If he can defend his position with cogent arguments, you know
you must convince your client of the validity of the buyer’s offer.
Advancing or Accepting an Offer
When working on offers that represent the seller, you want to take control from
the beginning. You want to dictate the time of meeting and the delivery method
of the information (meeting in person or faxing the offer). It’s also advisable to
try and control the other agent in this process. Sometimes the other agent can
get anxious, so informing her of the times frames of your meetings and when to
expect a response will help her and her buyers remain calm.
As a buyer’s agent, you want to try to influence the presentation timeline of
your offer, especially if the home is well-priced and in a competitive price range.
The truth is that buyer’s agents have little control in this process. The listing
agent has all the power because they make the rules up as to when and where
the offer presentation will be. I personally didn’t like the lack of control, which
was another reason that I worked exclusively with sellers for the better part of
my career and had buyer’s agents who worked with the buyers on my team.
When representing sellers, I always requested that offers be faxed rather than
personally presented to my clients by buyer’s agents. I was one of the first
agents in the country to take this approach nearly 15 years ago, and today
251
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

it’s commonplace. Receiving a buyer’s offer by fax allows the agent and the
seller time to consider the offer before responding to it.
When representing buyers, I preferred to present the offer personally
because I could clearly express my buyer’s intentions rather than have them
relayed through the seller’s agent. By presenting personally, I also could
gauge the seller’s response by watching facial expressions. I could express
my view of the property value. Also, I could share information about the
prospective buyers in an effort to build the human connection that so often
sways the sellers’ acceptance decision.
Presenting a buyer’s low offer
When presenting an offer below the asking price,
 Discuss the overall offer before revealing the price. First, work
through and find common ground on the other stipulations in the offer.
Then negotiate the price after you and the seller (or seller’s agent) have
agreed to or adjusted the other items that aren’t related to price, such
as time of possession, closing date, and any personal property included
in the sale like the swing set or the washer and dryer.
 When discussing price, identify the difference between the asking and
offered prices, and focus the discussion only on that number. Ask the
seller, “If the buyer had come in here with cash and closing was in a
couple of weeks, would the offer have been acceptable?” If they say that
they would take $345,000 now, use the $345,000 number as your discus-
sion price. Don’t deal with the big numbers, like a $350,000 asking price
and a $335,000 offer. Instead, break it down to a comparison between the
$345,000 they would take now if a buyer walked in with cash and the
$335,000 offer. The real difference is $10,000. Talk and plan in terms of a
$10,000 difference between the seller and buyer.
 Break the cost of the difference down to a daily rate. The effect of this
technique is to reduce the difference to a ridiculously small amount. For
example, suppose the difference is $10,000. Ask the seller to consider the
actual impact of the difference; the majority of sellers end up as buyers,
so what you’re really asking him to consider is the cost of borrowing
$10,000 more for his next house. In fact, the cost of that $10,000 is about
$750 a year, or $62.50 a month, or $2.08 a day. With this information in
hand, you can ask, “Is it worth $2.08 a day to know that your home is sold
and that you have the freedom to move into your next home?” This same
technique works well to raise the offer on the buyer’s side or even to
reach a midpoint agreement, in which each party can pay $1.04 a day, for
example, to create a win/win outcome for the buyer and seller.
 Explain how the buyer arrived at her offer price. Show current comps to
validate her thinking. The property may have been listed months ago, and
in the meantime, the market environment may have changed considerably.
252
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Presenting a current market analysis can help justify and win acceptance
of the offer.
 If appropriate and true, explain that the buyer has another home in
mind, saying, “She wanted to try to work with you first.”
 If the offer is the highest the buyer can go, express that fact by saying,
“The buyer would really love the home, but she understands if there’s
not an opportunity for a win for everyone.” This kind of statement
defuses emotions before they arise.
Above all, when presenting a low price, convey that the offer is based on a
realistic assessment of the market environment or the buyer’s capability, not
a personal reaction to the seller or the home.
After you extend an offer below the asking price, be prepared to present off-
setting benefits in an effort to make the offer attractive and valuable to the
seller. Alternate redeeming qualities you can mention include:
 Solid earnest money
 Buyers with impeccable credit
 Buyers with good, solid employment history
 Buyers with ample funds and a low loan-to-value ratio
 Buyers with the flexibility to close quickly or wait as long as 90 days
Receiving a buyer’s low offer
If you did your job way back at the conclusion of the listing presentation (see
Chapter 9), your seller should be well aware of the likelihood of a low offer.
When one comes in, call the buyer’s agent to discover more about the buyer.
Ask whether she has the funds to close, whether she’s selected a lending
institution, and where she is in regards to securing a loan (if she’s just start-
ing and hasn’t even met with a lender yet or if she has loan approval and is
just working to find the right house).
Your job is to explain this information to the seller so she clearly under-
stands the risks of each buyer that makes an offer on a home. The risk can be
the mitigating factor between two offers. A buyer who is preapproved and
has a loan waiting may have a lower offer and still win the home due to the
fact that the buyer already has preapproval (instead of just having talked
with a lender).
If the buyer has already initiated the loan process, ask the agent what loan
amount she’s been approved for. You may find out that the buyer can obtain
a loan higher than the amount shown on the offer contract, which alerts you
to the fact that she’s qualified to pay more but is choosing not to. Your job
253
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

then is to demonstrate that the home has a higher value than the price
offered. On the other hand, if you find out that the buyer has been approved
for exactly the loan amount listed on the contract, ask, “Is this the maximum
she qualifies for?”
If the buyer’s agent can’t provide the loan answers you need, present the
same questions to the mortgage originators the buyer’s working with. The
“Working with a Closing Team” section later in this chapter gives advice for
working with lending and other partners in the transaction.
Taking the insult out of an insulting offer
The first step toward taking the sting out of a low offer is assuring your client
that the offer is financial, not personal. Most likely, the prospective buyer
doesn’t know your seller or your seller’s family. The buyer may not even
know the rationale behind the number presented, having relied on poor
counsel, too much counsel, or an unskilled agent, in which case a well-
presented counteroffer is in order.
On the flip side, the seller’s house may be overpriced, either because the
seller insisted on a high price or because the market environment changed
between when the home was listed and when the offer arrived. If a home is
radically overpriced, a fair offer can look insulting when it really isn’t.
If your seller’s home is overpriced, you must shift the focus to the gap between
the low offer and fair market value, not the difference between fair market
value and the inflated listing price. This calculation alone is likely to remove
tens of thousands of dollars of “insult.” If that doesn’t work, ask the cooperat-
ing agent to share the burden by explaining the rationale behind the offer.
A good agent won’t write an insulting offer. I was asked many times to write
ridiculously low offers, and I consistently refused to represent those buyers on
the equivalent of a fishing expedition. One client chastised me, saying I was
required by law to write whatever she wanted to offer. I corrected her misinter-
pretation of my responsibility. Agents are required by law in most states to pre-
sent all offers they write, but nothing forces agents to write garbage that’s
embarrassing to present, wasteful of their time, and costly to their reputations.
Getting beyond emotion
People get emotional during the weeks leading up to a closing for a number
of reasons. Money is at stake, both parties are anxious to get the deal done,
and time is ticking away. Plus, home inspections and low-priced offers reveal
opinions about a home’s value that can feel jarring to a seller who has viewed
the home with pride and joy for a number of years.
254
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

The only antidote to an emotional uprising is a pragmatic focus on every-
one’s goals and a renewed commitment to find common ground and get the
deal done.
A few years ago, my father sold the family home I grew up in. My mother had
died six months earlier, and he wanted to start a new life. Fortunately, I didn’t
represent him in the sale, but he did call to discuss an offer he’d received. We
talked for 45 minutes one night while I was driving through mountain passes
on my way to a speaking engagement in Vail, Colorado. (By the way, I would
never talk with anyone but my dad for 45 minutes about a contract.) He was
such a typical seller! His big issue was the sales price; I asked him the ques-
tion I often pose to get to the core of what’s affecting a sale negotiation: “Dad,
is the reason you want this price for the house based on your ego, or do you
really need the money?” The silence on the other end of the phone was my
answer. Of course, I knew he didn’t need the $20,000 he was so emotional
about. From that point, he was able to find common ground with the buyer
and get the home sold.
When you hit a buyer-seller impasse, ask, “Is this about ego or income? Do
you want the bragging rights that come with a high price, or do you need the
money?” Usually, you bring your client back down to earth in a hurry. In
essence, you’re asking, “What are you really fighting for?”
Turning concessions into victories
Buyer offers are usually accompanied by home inspection conditions that
require the seller to make concessions before the deal is closed. Usually,
these concessions take the form of repairs that the seller needs to make
before the buyer takes possession. The presentation of repair concessions is
one of the toughest steps in the negotiation process. Buyers often use the
home inspection step to wring a bit more value out of their offers. Sellers,
who feel they already gave at the office when they accepted the price offer,
aren’t in the mood to give more.
No matter whether you’re representing the buyer or seller, bring the focus
down to the value of the requests. By itemizing the concessions and assign-
ing value in terms of dollars, hassle, and time invested, you can maneuver a
transaction to the end. Follow these recommendations:
 Of the items on the list, select more than half of the easiest, least
expensive issues to act upon. For example, if the list has ten items, pick
six or seven of them. By dealing with more than half the requested
items, you demonstrate your client’s goodwill effort to meet the other
party more than halfway.
 Call the other agent and say, “I doubt that I can be persuasive enough
to get the seller to handle all your requests. If your client had to have
a few of these concessions to keep the deal together, which ones would
255
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

they be?” This strategy enables you to know which requests represent
potential deal-killers.
 Explain to the other agent that while you can’t guarantee you’ll get
your seller to agree, you’ll see what you can do. This lets the other
agent know that you’re working for the win/win for all. But remember,
you’re setting a low standard upfront and when you come back with
more than half you can explain it as a victory for them.
 Focus on what your client’s gaining out of the deal. If your seller’s
pocketing a huge equity increase, focus on that fact. Urge her not to let
$1,500 worth of repairs stand in the way of $300,000 cash in her pockets.
If your buyer’s moving to a terrific home in the perfect neighborhood for
her family, focus on that. You may want to say something like this:
“Mr. and Mrs. Buyer, we spent days and looked at over 40 homes to find
this one that you described as perfect. Do you really want to start that
process over again?”
To turn concessions into victories, focus your clients on what they’re gaining
rather than on what they’re giving up.
Dealing with I win/you lose clients
Some clients, and some agents for that matter, only feel satisfied if they win
and someone else loses.
The best way to handle I win/you lose situations is to avoid them. If you
can’t, then deal with them professionally, powerfully, and from a position of
control. No matter what, don’t back down. Most I win/you lose clients are
perpetually testing the water to see how much they can get away with.
I once took on an expired listing for a seller I knew had an I win/you lose person-
ality, but I thought I could overcome her tendencies. I got the price right and
was confident I could sell and close quickly. What I didn’t know was that I was
dealing with what I call a “toxic client.” I managed to sell her home to one of my
own buyer clients in a reasonable time for full price and free rent back. She got a
great deal. Then she called me three days before closing to inform me that she
wouldn’t close the transaction unless I cut my fee by $4,000. I informed her that
I understood her request but wouldn’t reduce my fee. I explained that she had
the right to not sell but that I had the right to lien her property for my fee and
potentially take legal action to collect. I also indicated that the buyer may take
legal action to force her to complete the sale if she didn’t close the deal in a few
days. I told her, “As your agent, I would advise you to close the sale as sched-
uled.” Three days later, she did what I expected her to do. She closed.

Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

Working with a Closing Team
Most sellers and buyers think of the agreement as the tricky part of the trans-
action and the closing as the part they can take pretty much for granted.
Agents know otherwise. As an agent, your work isn’t done and your payment
teeters in the balance until you successfully complete this final, challenging
part of the real estate transaction.
The closing involves an army of people, and a good closing team can help
you increase your prosperity by letting you efficiently wind up one deal so
you to move on to the next.
Work diligently during the weeks leading to the close to see that the loan,
title work, and escrow or document preparation are handled by people on
your own closing team. Make it your objective to direct the business to com-
panies and individuals you know will perform in a timely, professional
manner. Doing so assures your clients good service and fewer surprises and
reduces the time you and your staff invest in closing the transaction.
The following sections introduce the closing team lineup and advise how to
work with everyone to make the closing a smooth process.
The loan officer
The loan officer holds a front-line position on your closing team. He or she
secures the appraiser, verifies deposit of funds, verifies employment, and,
ideally, completes the loan package for the buyer within a few days of con-
tract acceptance.
Make sure that the loan officer on your team is a great salesperson backed 
by a highly organized team that’s able to push transactions through to a
seamless close. A good loan officer can smooth out problems before you
even hear about them, averting landmines and sparing you significant and
time-consuming challenges.
Loan officers can add considerable value to your business even beyond the
sales closing. When you form a relationship with a loan officer, you can work
in concert to land clients. You can follow up on leads together, or you can
refer clients to each other; ultimately, you both win more business as a result
of the relationship.
257
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

The home inspector
The home inspector is hired to evaluate the condition of the property, spot cur-
rent or potential defects, and give guidance regarding the proper remedies.
On your closing team, you want a home inspector who can quickly produce
an easy-to-read report written in everyday language. If technical jargon is nec-
essary, insist on plain-English translations. Nothing concerns buyers more
than problems they don’t understand.
Work with home inspectors who are thorough and who fully disclose all defects
and items in need of repair without throwing gasoline on potential problems.
Beware the home inspector who’s an alarmist, and instead look for someone
who resembles Sergeant Joe Friday with his “just the facts, ma’am” approach.
The appraiser
Because lending institutions often have the largest stake in a home — greater
even than that of borrowers — they hire appraisers to determine the value of
property.
Most lenders have relationships with a number of appraisers. Each appraiser
follows a unique valuation approach and, as a result, each interprets the
value of a home slightly differently. If you’re working a deal and having trou-
ble getting the property to appraise out at the sales price, ask your mortgage
originator if another appraiser may be called upon.
Some appraisers have low-cost, limited-level memberships in the local MLS
and therefore don’t receive lockbox keys. The membership saves them money
but creates an inconvenience for agents on whom they have to rely for access
to homes. Follow the once dumb–twice stupid rule: If you have to drive out to
a home just to open a door for an appraiser or, worse yet, to stand around and
wait until the job is done, make it a point to work with a different appraiser in
the future! You’ll find plenty of great appraisers that don’t waste your time
opening doors.
The escrow closer
An escrow closer is a neutral third party who coordinates the preparation and
signing of documents, holds and distributes funds, and records the documents
and deeds involved in a transaction. Some states are non-escrow states, which
means the real estate company provides these services or, in some states, an
attorney prepares all the legal documents. Check with your broker to clarify
the standard operating procedure in your area.
258
Part III: Developing a Winning Sales Strategy 

A good escrow officer keeps the transaction on track for an on-time closing.
He or she also provides a second point of reassurance for your client by
doing the following:
 Staying in close communication with you and the client throughout the
weeks leading up to closing
 Sharing updates that confirm things are going well
 Underscoring what a great agent you are and how lucky the client is to
be working with you
The escrow company can also be associated with the title company, which
researches the home’s previous owners and searches for liens and encum-
brances on the property. Most lenders require title searches to ensure that
titles are clear before they issue loans for properties. Lenders are in what’s
called first position, meaning that they take control if buyers default on loans.
Avoiding Derailment
Like a train, a transaction can be derailed at any point on the track. A trans-
action can be hit by a clouded title, a home not appraising for value, a rapid
change in interest rates, an undisclosed credit or income issue, or one of
countless other unanticipated choke points.
Choke points cause delays, and delays cause all kinds of problems for buyers,
sellers, and agents. Moving plans are thrown into disarray, interim housing or
early-possession requests become necessary, contingency plans need to be
thrown together, and nerves get jangled. The resulting situation can be not
only a nightmare for even the most seasoned agent but also a productivity
killer.
Eighty percent of the problems in closing transactions fall into the following
three basic areas. Stay on the lookout for these problems and solutions to
steer your transactions clear of as much trouble as possible:
 Documentation and verification: Lenders need to assemble consider-
able paperwork and complete dozens of documents based on informa-
tion submitted by loan applicants. Then, lenders need to verify all
information for accuracy by checking the applicants’ employment
status, funds on deposit, and income levels. The document preparation
and information verification process takes time. Counsel your buyers
that if they fail to submit the required information on a timely basis, or if
they turn it in piecemeal, delays are inevitable.
 Repairs, repairs, repairs: Good advance planning can avert this choke
point: When you’re representing the seller, state clearly in writing that
only lender-required repairs will be made. If you don’t spell this out, you
259
Chapter 13: Negotiating the Contract and Closing the Deal

leave the seller open to the risk that the buyer will come back with a
laundry list of items to be done.
A lender-required note in the listing agreement for the other agent to see
usually limits repairs to structural, mechanical, or health and safety
issues, with not a word about nicks in a wall or non-matching door
knobs. Having a lender-required note doesn’t imply that the other agent
won’t ask for more, but it does serve notice that the seller is willing at
this point to only remedy lender-required repairs only.
Consider writing a dollar limit for repairs into the initial contract. The
number isn’t etched in stone, but it helps keep a lid on the potential
amount for which your seller is responsible. The buyer may still refuse
to lift the home inspection contingency until additional lender-required
issues are dealt with, but the limit helps most sellers most of the time.
 Underwriting of the buyer’s loan: The underwriter has complete power
to approve the loan, approve the loan with additional conditions, or sus-
pend the file until certain conditions are met, in which case the bor-
rower starts the underwriting process all over again.
Underwriters check to make sure that a loan meets guidelines for debt
ratio, loan-to-value ratio, credit score, employment history, and other
qualifications. They also evaluate the loan based on whether they can be
bundled with others in a big loan package that can be sold to Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac, or another entity that buys mortgages.
Very few lending institutions hold their loans to maturity. Most write
loans, realize profits through origination fees, document preparation
fees and margins on basis points, and then sell the loans within 30 to 60
days, recouping the loan amount to sell again as part of the next loan
deal. If an underwriter approves a loan that can’t be resold, the lending
institution has to keep the loan in its portfolio. If that situation occurs
too often and too many loans can’t be resold, the lending institution
runs out of money to loan, driving it out of business.
Of all the choke points in a transaction, the underwriting process can
cause the biggest delays. Expect there to be times when underwriters
slow things down with requests for second appraisals or additional doc-
umentation of value, especially if the home is in a high price range. After
you clear the underwriting hurdle, the documents can be drawn and
sent to closing.

Let’s get on with the show!

Chapter 14
Staking Your Competitive Position
In This Chapter
 Understanding your marketplace and competitive position
 Knowing what statistics to calculate and monitor
 Determining and conveying your competitive advantage
A
sk most agents how they’re different or better than their agent colleagues
or competitors and get ready to hear either a whole lot of hemming and
hawing, or a lineup of platitudes about how they care more, work harder, make
clients happier, or whatever.
What you’ll rarely hear is a summary of how the agent is statistically more
effective than other agents, or how that statistical advantage translates into a
strong position in the overall market and a dominant position in a particular
market niche.
If any of those terms sound foreign, read on. This chapter gives you a leg up
by showing you how to analyze your marketplace, calculate your performance
statistics, compare your statistics with market norms, and stake out your own
competitive territory by knowing — based on clear calculations — exactly
how you excel and what market territory you control better than anyone else.
Competitive Positioning Defined
If you don’t know how you stack up against your competitors or how your
performance is different or better than the average, take comfort in the fact
that you’re certainly not alone. It amazes me how even very successful
agents often can’t define their competitive positions. As a new agent you’re
certainly lacking in your track record. I show you later in the chapter how to
create your competitive positions using your company to your advantage.
In a sentence, your competitive position defines how your real estate practice is
better than all others in some unique and meaningful way. You may be dominant
when it comes to selling ranch-style homes, or you may excel in high-end or
low-end properties or properties in a certain neighborhood or design category.

In all cases, your competitive position must be real, defensible, and definable,
which means it must be based on statistics, and that’s what the following sec-
tions of this chapter explain.
The best agents — the most powerful, experienced, high-volume agents —
share a single advantage: They know the statistics of their market, the statis-
tics of their own performance, and their statistical position in the overall
marketplace or in a particular niche market area. The truth is, however, that
a very small percentage of real estate agents fit into this category. I estimate
that this group is less than 1 percent of all agents.
Recently I was on a coaching call with a powerful agent in the San Diego mar-
ketplace. Her business was going great, but she was looking to the future and
planning how to grow to an even higher level. She had compiled her sales sta-
tistics, and we took some time to analyze her performance, define her position,
and create a marketing strategy to build upon her competitive advantage:
 Performance: In 2005, 56 homes were listed and sold in one of her
market niches. Of those, 17, or more than 30 percent, were her listings;
her nearest competitor listed two. By listings alone, she was 8.5 times
more successful than any other agent in her competitive sphere. She
also sold more homes in her niche than anyone else. Her closest com-
petitor was a company of 75 agents that listed and sold five homes.
 Position: It didn’t take long for the numbers to prove that she owned a
dominant position in her market niche. She knew she was strong, but
until she did the math she didn’t realize just how strong a position she’d
staked out. By the end of our call, she had the facts she needed to posi-
tion herself as the Emerald Heights real estate expert.
 Marketing strategy: Emerald Heights includes 700 homes. Annually it
sees an ownership turnover of 8 percent, which means that somewhere
between 50 and 70 homes are bought and sold each year almost as pre-
dictably as clockwork. To increase income, my client knew she couldn’t
just convince more people to sell. Her revenue growth would need to
result from winning a greater portion of the existing business in the
market, and that’s what she’s prepared to do. She plans to grow her slice
of the market-share pie (which is discussed later in this chapter) by
taking listings and sales from other agents. By presenting herself as the
regional expert — with the indisputable statistics to back the claim —
she’s ready to attract an even greater number of qualified leads and con-
vince an ever-growing number of clients to select her services based on
the proven advantage she offers.
If you’re a newer agent, you probably don’t yet have the stats to stake your
competitive position. However, if you selected your real estate company well
(see more on this topic in Chapter 3), your company likely does. Work with
your broker to find out how your company excels in the marketplace and pre-
sent your company’s advantage while you build your own success story.
264
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Calculating and Analyzing Real 
Estate’s Big Three Statistics
Three key statistics reflect real estate sales success better than any other
indicators. These statistics are: Average list price compared to average sales
price, average number of days on the market, and average number of listings
sold versus listings taken. The following sections look at the value and power
of each calculation.
Average list price to sales price
The average list price to sales price ratio quantifies your skill and success in
achieving the result you and your client expected when you priced and placed
a home on the market. By presenting a strong list price to sales price ratio,
you clearly illustrate your effectiveness for your sellers.
Doing the math
To calculate your average list price to sales price ratio (or as I call it, list-to-
sold ratio), follow these four steps:
1. Make a list of all your listed homes that sold and closed over a span of
at least three months, though a year is better.
2. Add up the list prices of all the homes.
Let’s say that you listed three homes that sold in the last quarter. If
those listings were priced at $259,000, $349,000, and $429,000, you had a
total listed inventory of $1,037,000.
3. Add up the sales prices of all the homes.
If your listed homes that sold last quarter closed at $245,000, $337,000,
and $405,000, then your total sold inventory was $987,000.
4. Calculate your average list price to sale price ratio by dividing your
total sold inventory by your total listed inventory.
Using the above example, divide $987,000 by $1,037,000. The calculation
results in a list-to-sold ratio of 95 percent. Based on your recent perfor-
mance, a seller who lists with you can expect an average of 95 percent of
the sales price.
Total sold inventory ÷ Total listed inventory = List-to-sold ratio
Your list-to-sold ratio proclaims from the mountaintops your level of success.
It’s one of the first calculations I ask a coaching client to figure. The ratio
265
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

establishes a clear benchmark of how an agent’s doing at pricing and negoti-
ating, and it provides a clear indicator of an agent’s skills, abilities, knowl-
edge, and systems.
Using your ratio
Regardless of the nature of your marketplace, the list-to-sold ratio for all
good agents varies only by a few percentage points.
My view is that 95 percent is the bottom of the good range. An agent with a
list-to-sold ratio of 95 percent loses $5,000 for every $100,000 in sales price. If
you’re selling a $600,000 home and settle for 95 percent of list price, the
resulting reduction is $30,000! Aim for a ratio of 98 percent or above.
Beyond achieving a list-to-sold ratio of 95 percent or higher, aim for a ratio
that places your performance in the top tier of all agents in your marketplace.
When you can prove to prospective sellers that you consistently achieve a
higher-than-average list-to-sold ratio for your clients, their decision to entrust
their home sale to you becomes vastly easier.
To determine how your list-to-sold ratio compares in your marketplace,
follow these steps:
1. Figure out the average list-to-sold ratio for all agents in your 
marketplace.
Most MLS services provide this statistic for each geographic area they
serve. Call your local MLS office, your local real estate board, or ask
your broker to find the information.
2. Compare your ratio with the market average.
For example, over my career, my average list price to sales price was
between 98 percent and 99 percent. My market’s average was between
91 percent and 95 percent.
3. Use your outstanding performance statistics to prove numerically that
clients will net more money working with you than with other agents.
If your average is 98 percent and your market average is 91 percent, then
sellers listing with you are likely to put 7 percent more in their pockets.
If you’re a new agent with few listed properties, rely on your company’s list-
to-sold stats while developing your individual performance.
Whether you’re presenting your own or your company’s stats, you’ll want to
present numbers that are higher than market averages; otherwise they indicate
serious problems with your business. If your stats are low, you need to work to
improve your performance as explained in the next section. Until your stats are
higher, omit talking about them during your listing presentations.
266
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Improving your ratio
Your list-to-sold price ratio shows your skill in pricing a home properly.
Obviously if you take vastly overpriced listings and deal with the conse-
quences later, your list-to-sold ratio will suffer accordingly. Chapter 10 is full
of advice on how to avoid this trap.
The list-to-sold ratio is also a strong reflection of your skill in negotiating on
behalf of a seller. In a neutral market, most initial offers come in at less than 95
percent of the list price. For instance, a home listed at $259,000 might gener-
ate an initial offer in the low $230,000 range. Whether it sells at that price or
higher depends on the listing agent’s ability to demonstrate to the buyer and
buyer’s agent the value of the property, with the aim of bringing the offer up to
$250,000 or even $255,000, at which point the list-to-sold ratio climbs back to
98 percent. For advice on how to deal with low offers, turn to Chapter 13.
Finally, the list-to-sold ratio is affected by your marketing, staging, and expo-
sure of the property. If these are some of your sticking points, see the follow-
ing chapters for more details: Chapter 8 will help you plan successful open
houses, Chapter 11 is full of staging advice, and Chapter 12 is all about mar-
keting the properties list.
Average days on the market
Your ability to sell a home, on average, in fewer than 30 days clearly conveys
to potential sellers your skill and success level. It further indicates your knowl-
edge of competitive pricing. The 30-day mark is a good benchmark to shoot for
provided that your marketplace is either a neutral marketplace or a seller’s
marketplace. If you’re in a buyer’s marketplace, you may see that number push
up a little higher.
An agent with a strong track record for quickly selling homes presents a clear
competitive advantage to sellers for the following reasons:
 Agents that sell properties quickly generally achieve higher sale
prices and put more money in their sellers’ pockets. Buyers in today’s
marketplace are extremely sophisticated. One of the first questions they
ask an agent is, “How long has the house been on the market?” Buyers
realize that the best homes sell quickly. If they find out that a home has
been slow to sell, they adjust their initial offer downward accordingly.
 Sellers with newly listed properties have a stronger negotiation position
when an offer comes in. If the home has only been on the market a few
days, buyers realize that the seller is less likely to offer price concessions.
 Sellers with slow-to-sell homes sacrifice dollars through a lower sale
price and through ongoing expenses for a home they no longer want
267
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

to own. This two-edged sword is the one agents need to point out in
order to shorten the time a home languishes on the market. Sellers often
want to hold out for a higher offer, but as time goes by, that higher offer
becomes less likely. Contrary to the beliefs of many clients, sellers don’t
make more money by waiting, say, 120 days rather than accepting an
offer in the first 30 days from listing. In fact, studies show that sellers
receive less and less over time. And while they wait, they have to make
additional mortgage payments that do little to reduce their debt or
increase their equity.
By showing that your listings spend a lower-than-average number of days on
the market, you’ll present proof that prospective sellers gain a significant com-
petitive edge and financial advantage when they choose to work with you.
Doing the math
To calculate the average number of days your listings spend on the market,
follow these steps:
1. Make a list of all your listings that sold during the last three months.
Alongside each listing, note the number of days that passed between
when the home was listed and when a sale contract was signed.
2. Add up the days on the market for all homes on your list.
For example, if you had five sold listings, one that sold after 33 days on
the market and the others after 45, 62, 21, and 84 days, your total would
be 245 days.
3. Divide the total number of days on the market by the number of list-
ings sold.
If you had five sold listings last quarter that were on the market for a
total of 245 days, your average number of days on the market per prop-
erty over that period would be 49.
Total number of days that all your sold listings were on the market ÷ Number
of sold listings = Average days on the market ratio
If you’re a new agent and don’t yet have a significant number of listings, find
out the average number of days that your company’s listings were on the
market and present that figure while you’re building your own business.
Working the numbers
When comparing your average days on the market ratio with market-wide
real estate averages, take into account the following considerations:
 After calculating the average number of days your own listings were
on the market, conduct the same calculation for your overall MLS area
or real estate board.
268
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

As a new agent your initial numbers should be at least consistent with
the market averages. You want to be able to sell your own individual sta-
tistics as early as possible in your career. Selling your company stats
exclusively will lead to trouble if you’re still doing it 18 to 24 months
after you begin your career.
 Be aware that the price range you sell in can affect the average number
of days on the market. In general, homes in an area with a higher price
range result in a higher average number of days on the market.
If you have a high number of listings, consider creating average calcula-
tions for various price ranges or geographic market areas. By doing this,
you can create apples-to-apples comparisons with other agents by ana-
lyzing performance in specific segments of the market.
 When comparing your performance with market-wide averages,
strengthen your competitive position by including in your calcula-
tions homes that failed to sell. When doing so, be sure to disclose that
expired listings are included in your calculations. By factoring in expired
listings, you reflect the most comprehensive view of how many days
homes sat on the market, whether they ultimately sold or not.
By including expired listings in your average calculations, the market
average will likely go up sharply because the vast majority of expired
listings will have been on the market for 120 days or more. Therefore, if
your overall market saw a number of expired listings and you personally
had none, the gap between you and your competitors will stretch con-
siderably and to your great advantage.
Average listings taken versus listings sold
The average listings taken versus listings sold statistic is a competitive
number that demonstrates to the world how well you do your job of selling
homes. When you can say to a seller that you sell more than 98 percent of all
the homes that sellers list with you, you present strong evidence to your
clients that they can assume a greatly lowered risk when working with you.
One of the greatest fears a seller experiences stems from these concerns:
“What if I pick the wrong agent? What if I’m hearing fast talk from a salesper-
son who wants to pound a “For Sale” sign in my yard even though he doesn’t
have the experience to get the job done?” By presenting your track record in
the form of a high percentage of listings sold versus listings taken, you quickly
erase those concerns and provide comfort and relief to prospects.
In a neutral marketplace with good sale activity, the average listings taken
versus listings sold ratio historically hovers around 65 percent. When you
look at the number of sales against the number of expired listings and proper-
ties withdrawn from the marketplace, the average is 65 percent. Think about
269
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

it: That means one-third of the listed homes fail to sell for some reason or
another. This is an astonishing figure that average agents and most sellers
don’t realize, and it’s a nugget you can use to your competitive advantage.
Doing the math
To calculate your listings taken versus listings sold ratio, follow these steps:
1. Add up the total of all properties you listed over the last three months.
2. Of all properties listed over the last three months, add up how 
many sold.
3. Divide the number of sold listings by the total number of listings to
get your listings taken versus listings sold average.
Number of all listings sold ÷ Number of all properties listed = Average listings
taken versus listings sold ratio
Benefiting from a sky-high average
When I was selling homes, I took more than 120 listings a year, of which only
a couple failed to sell. I knew this average distinguished me and created a
strong competitive position that I used in my listing presentations. I would
ask the sellers: “Based on my average listings sold versus listings taken percent-
age of 98 percent, would you agree that you really have no risk listing your home
with me?” If I encountered hesitation or resistance after that statement, I’d pre-
sent an analogy like this: “Mr. and Mrs. Seller, if Bobby came home with his math
test next week and showed you that he scored a 98 percent, would you consider
that an outstanding result?” If they didn’t answer that last question with a strong
“yes,” I had to question whether they were the type of clients I wanted to win
over. If they did say yes, I’d continue, saying something like: “So, that means
you agree that 98 percent of listings taken versus listings sold is outstanding as
well, correct?”
Agents are paid to achieve results. The truth is that you can be the nicest
person in the world, and you can call your sellers weekly, send them stuff in
the mail, share marketing reports, and hand out coffeehouse gift certificates.
You can fawn over them as much as anyone can. However, if you don’t sell the
home within the listing period, in their view you didn’t do your job and you’re
incompetent. Not only will you not get paid for the sale of their home, but
you’ll also lose future sales from all the friends they would have otherwise
referred to you. Sellers base their assessment of an agent’s service solely on
results. Did the home sell? Did they achieve the expected sales price? Did it sell
in a reasonable time frame? Were they able to move when they wanted to?
During a listing presentation, sellers obviously can’t figure out exactly what
their experience with you will be like. But the statistics and competitive posi-
tions you present give them a pretty clear idea of what they can expect. Per-
formance ratios tell your story in numbers and give prospects the facts they
need to make good decisions.
270
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Over the course of my career, I regularly went head-to-head against a strong
competitive agent who did almost as much business as I did. Frequently, we
both sought the same expired listings and our calls and mailings to the owners
often arrived almost in sequence. Yet when all was said and done, I ultimately
never lost a listing to him. He never knew why, and I am sure it bugged him. My
secret weapon was my list-to-sale ratio. His was terrible, sitting somewhere
below 60 percent. When the client was making the decision, all I had to do was
show the list of my active, pending, sold, and expired properties. Then I would
put his list next to mine for the seller to review. I knew what I was up against
when I was competing with him. I had the facts to present, and they worked in
my favor every time.
Sellers want to know their odds of success. Use your stats to show them the
proven competitive advantage you bring to the table. Your list-to-sale ratio
goal should be at least 95 percent.
Interpreting the Findings
Be ready and willing to invest time to analyze and interpret yours and your
company’s competitive position in the marketplace. Your broker may have
useful stats to contribute, but you’ll likely need to do additional work to cal-
culate the Big Three ratios (which are described in the preceding section of
this chapter) and apply their resulting stats to various segments of your mar-
ketplace, including geographic areas and specific price ranges.
Without solid facts, you can’t possibly know, define, or describe your com-
petitive advantage. Most agents try to create their advantage through a rela-
tionship with a prospect or client. However, a relationship isn’t enough to
carry the day in a competitive marketplace. Read on to find out how to ana-
lyze your competitive position.
Finding your edge
Maybe your competitive edge is that you sell the most units, that you have
the highest sales volume, or that your Big Three stats top the charts in a spe-
cific geographic region or price range. Once you know your edge, you can
market and leverage your point of difference to expand your business (and
your income!).
For instance, you may find that you rank in the top five for units sold in your
area. You can leverage that strength as you expand into a nearby geographic
marketplace with similar types of homes. Instead of starting from zero in the
new market area, you can use your current dominant stats as a bridge. Instead
of ranking in the top five for units sold in your current market area, spread
your numbers over your current and future market areas, and you’ll probably
271
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

rank in the top ten for the combined area. Then you can work from that
respectable statistical position to gain more market share in your new, and
currently weaker, area.
Once you know your numbers, you can put them to work strategically and
tactically as you devise a plan to expand your market share. The key is to
start with the facts, dig to find your edge, interpret your edge, and exploit it
to your advantage. No one is going to present you listings and sales on silver
platter; you’re going to have to win them yourself.
Positioning yourself against other agents
Knowing how your competition is performing and how you rank in the field is
paramount to your success. Follow these suggestions:
 Find out the Big Three stats — average list price to sales price, average
days on the market, and average listings sold versus listings taken —
for other companies and agents. These numbers provide you with a
basis for comparison and help you begin the process of positioning
yourself and your company with the consumer.
 Define your competitive advantage. Keep in mind that how you state
your advantage is often as important as what you say. How you present
your argument and how much confidence and conviction you have in
your beliefs can make the difference between a listing and a futile effort.
The common belief for the masses until the 1500s was that the world
was flat. Facts aside, those who believed in the flat-world theory were
more effective in presenting their argument than Galileo was in his day.
 Convince your prospect of your advantage.
When I was a new real estate agent, I certainly had fewer reasons to pre-
sent as to why sellers should list with me than I did later in my career.
But that didn’t stop me from securing listings — largely because my con-
viction about the advantages I could offer sellers was so strong. I would
tell prospects that selling their home required a partnership with a
focused, passionate, successful, and sales-oriented agent. I would
explain that personal service, attention to detail, and creation and con-
version of leads would sell their home, and that I was the agent for the
job. I contrasted myself positively with other, more-established agents
by explaining that sellers hardly benefit from working with an agent who
passes them off to interact with a series of assistants who handle the
paperwork, marketing strategy, and ad calls, sign calls, and open houses.
My conviction regarding the advantage I offered sellers changed dramat-
ically after a few years in the business. By then, I had assembled a service
team and developed an excellent system for serving the client through
others. Obviously, my argument changed as well. I explained to clients
272
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

that one person couldn’t possibly do, with skill and precision, all the
activities that a seller needs and demands from an agent. With so many
hats to wear, a lone ranger agent can’t possibly provide the level of
exposure, communication, customer service, and expertise that the
team of experts I represented could deliver.
Both positions were truthful. Both had merit. The difference stemmed
from my position at the time and from the way I felt and articulated how
that position benefited my prospect.
 Use numbers to demonstrate the clear advantage you present to clients.
Realize that if prospects can’t see a clear difference between you and
other agents, they’ll gravitate toward the easy choice, which is to select
the agent offering the lowest commission rate or highest initial list price.
Creating sales and sales volume comparisons
Evaluating your performance against other agents or companies in your
market segment is a great starting point, but it’s rarely enough to uncover
your unique edge or point of difference.
When you compare your numbers to MLS stats for the number of units sold,
number of listings taken, number of listings sold, and total sales volume in
your market area, you arrive at a picture of how you did compared to the
market at large. However, chances are good that your business is focused on
certain segments of the total market — likely you specialize in certain neigh-
borhoods, certain price ranges, and even certain types of residences. To posi-
tion yourself against other agents, you need to segment, or what I call slice
and dice, the market-wide numbers. For example:
 You can shrink the geographic area down to a concise neighborhood or
region in order to compare your own performance with market perfor-
mance in that niche region.
 You can expand the geographic area to include several neighborhoods,
or even towns, in which you operate.
 You may want to analyze only real estate activity that falls in a certain
price range.
 You can choose to focus only on a segment that includes a particular
property type.
You must be ethical and fair when you segment the numbers. You need to
create true comparisons and honest evaluations of the sales numbers and
sales volume in each category you create. So long as you disclose the
approach you took and define the segment you analyzed, I personally feel
that focusing your analysis on a specific market segment is a fair way to
define and present your strong competitive position. See the sidebar titled
“Using statistics ethically and to your advantage” for a case in point.
273
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

Calculating per-agent productivity
Often, the largest company in a market will account for the largest sales
volume and sales numbers, creating a strong market presence that eclipses
the performance of small companies and individual agents. If you face a
David and Goliath situation, reach down and pick up the per-agent productiv-
ity stone to put in your slingshot.
Calculate per-agent productivity by dividing a company’s total sales numbers
by the number of agents working at the firm. You can use this calculation to
allow prospects to see listings taken, listings sold, total unit volume, sales
volume, or buyer-represented sales at a per-agent basis. Suddenly, Goliath
won’t look quite so dominant.
Using market-area statistics 
to set your goals
Always know the average agent success numbers for your marketplace.
These are the numbers you want to eclipse by the end of your first six
months in the business — at least.
274
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 
Using statistics ethically and to your advantage
When you compare your sales performance
with that of other agents, sometimes you want
to show how well you rank in terms of all the
sales in your entire market area, and sometimes
you want to focus on your dominant position in
a specific segment of the market. You can
expand or contract the portion of the market you
focus on, so long as you’re drawing a valid con-
clusion that you explain clearly to your client.
For example, consider an agent who is making
a listing presentation to sellers in a specific
development. She knows that if she presents
her track record solely in the seller’s home area
she will rank squarely in the middle of the agent
pack. This is hardly a winning position.
However, if she expands the market area to
include the seller’s development and the devel-
opment called Arrowwood, her ranking will
shoot straight up to the top of the list, since 
she outsells her nearest competitor two-to-one
in the Arrowwood area. She decides to show
her sales performance based on market activity
in both developments. When presenting her
findings — and her dominant market position —
she explains to the sellers that she expanded
her market study to include transactions in
Arrowwood, as well as in the sellers’ develop-
ment, because most buyers consider both of the
developments when selecting a home similar to
the type the sellers’ will be listing.
Her approach put her in a strong position.
However, note that the approach was also eth-
ical and clearly explained and was the basis for
a valid comparison that was useful to her and to
the sellers.

Know the Big Three statistics (if you’re not crystal clear about what these are
and how to calculate them, turn back to the first pages of this chapter for def-
initions and formulas) and know exactly how your own performance stacks
up against market averages. I tell agents: Knowing thyself and thy competi-
tion is the first rule to follow when you want to gain a competitive advantage.
Once the stats are in front of you, you can compare your performance to the
market area average. Ask yourself the following questions:
 What doesn’t look positive at first glance?
 Where are you falling behind?
 If you broaden or shrink the criteria, does your positioning improve?
 How can you craft a position from which to sell if you’re stuck with 
these stats?
Use the first two questions to set improvement goals. Use the third question
to determine a segment in which you excel. Use the fourth question to pack-
age the facts, whatever they are, into a position that you can present with
confidence and conviction.
Increasing Your Slice of the Market
Market share is the percentage of sales that you control in your marketplace.
Market share can be based on listings taken, listings sold, buyer sales, sales
volume, or sales by units. In any case, your share reflects the portion of total
market activity that is represented by you or your company.
Nothing attracts business more easily than dominant market share. When
you’ve increased your slice of the pie to the point that it dwarfs your compe-
tition, the prospects begin to seek you out.
I coach an agent on the East Coast who, in the two towns she dominates,
single handedly sells more homes than the number two and number three
companies in sales and unit volume. Last year she listed and sold 66 proper-
ties in her market areas. Over the same amount of time, the top competing
companies together sold 59 properties. The balance just keeps tipping in her
favor because success breeds success, and nothing indicates success better
than dominant market share.
How to calculate market share
To calculate your market share, simply divide your production (or your com-
pany’s production) by the overall production of your marketplace. Your broker
should be able to provide this information.
275
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

For example, say 575 homes were sold last year in your market area. If your
company sold 215 of those 575, then your company handled 37 percent of all
transactions and controls 37 percent of the market activity (215 ÷ 575 = .37).
Your broker should be able to provide this information to you.
Also, calculate market share in various market segments by following the
“slice and dice” advice in the section titled “Creating sales and sales volume
comparisons” earlier in this chapter. You may find that your overall market
share is low but that you have a commanding market share in a certain neigh-
borhood or price category.
How to increase market penetration
Market penetration is another way to describe market share. If you command
a large share of your market, you’ve achieved significant market penetration.
If your market share is minimal, your penetration is minimal as well.
A single agent can’t expect to penetrate a broad market overnight, if ever. For
years, I worked the east side of Portland, Oregon — a geographic area that
was home to 750,000 people. Even as productive as I was, with 150 home
sales a year, my market share was miniscule when compared to the size of
the marketplace. I barely scratched the market surface, so penetrating it was
out of the question. But within the market niche I’d carved out for myself, I
was a dominant force.
A niche is a segment of the overall market. Niche marketers serve a select
group of consumers whose interests and needs are distinctly different from
the needs of the market in general. Think of niche marketers as big fish in
small ponds.
You can create a market niche by serving consumers in a particular geo-
graphic area or consumers seeking a certain property type. Or you can serve
a certain type of buyer or seller or a certain income category — the list goes
on and on. You can create a niche by focusing your efforts and increasing
your penetration of FSBOs, expired listings, properties not occupied by
owners, or small multiplexes.
The key to gaining penetration in a niche is focus. You have to decide which
smaller section of the marketplace you want to work in, and you have to quit
trying to be all things to all people. After you identify your niche, you need to
create presence, penetration, and dominance by following these steps:
1. Make contact with prospects in your niche not just once but repeat-
edly over a compact period of time.
Studies show that it takes six impressions for a consumer simply to rec-
ognize who you are. By increasing the number and frequency of contacts
276
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

with prospects, you can increase your market awareness, which is a first
step in achieving niche market penetration.
2. Make personal contact.
For most agents, the preferred method of contact with people located in
a geographic segment is mail. They mail their prospects to death. They
send refrigerator magnets, note pads featuring the agent’s name and face,
local football, baseball, or basketball game schedules, annual calendars,
and more. Guess what? That’s not enough to achieve market penetration.
A few years ago, I started working with a client who wanted to penetrate a
large gated community where the turnover of homes was brisk and the sales
prices were high. She’d given herself a tall order because another agent domi-
nated the market and controlled more than a third of all the community’s real
estate business. Luckily, though, the dominant agent had become lazy and
reverted to easier contact approaches than face-to-face visits. My client
moved in with well-designed marketing pieces for use in mailing, but also
with a well-crafted personal contact strategy. When all was said and done,
and her market share goal was met and exceeded, she determined that her
success didn’t stem from marketing pieces that were better than the other
agent’s pieces. Her success came from the fact that the people who lived in
the gated community saw her frequently.
Whenever anyone in her firm listed a property in the community, she’d ask
and receive permission from the listing agent to hold its open house. Then,
prior to the open house, she’d walk around the neighborhood personally invit-
ing the neighbors. In between open houses, she provided the neighborhood
with regular market updates. She was constantly visible in the community
because she personally spent a few hours each week meeting and greeting her
prospective clients. When an expired listing came off the market, she showed
up at the owners’ front door. When a FSBO sign appeared in a front yard, she
was there as well. In fewer than 20 months she went from a single-digit market
share to a share of over 30 percent. Meanwhile, the once-dominant agent went
from 37 percent to less than 20 percent. She had been beaten by the effective-
ness of personal contact.
How to achieve market dominance
To become a dominant market force, you need to take market share from
someone else. Dominance involves growing your percentage of the overall
marketplace until you control a greater share of market business than any
competitor. In some markets, which are shared by a great number of competi-
tors, a 10 percent share may be dominant. In other situations, where fewer
competitors exist, you may need 30 percent, or an even higher share, to be
the dominant player.
277
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

To gain market share dominance, first you need to gain recognition, which
results almost automatically from simply doing more than you’re expected to
do. For example:
 Do more personal prospecting.
 Create more useable market and industry information.
 Communicate more with your clients.
 Get involved in your community by sponsoring picnics, baseball or
soccer teams, or community events.
Going above and beyond what is expected will earn you recognition and create
a buzz about how different you are. You’ll enhance your reputation. Suddenly,
rather than being an unknown agent, you’ll be a “name,” or a known entity.
With the confidence you build through your awareness-development efforts, go
one step further: Dare to do things that no one else is willing to do.
My client from the anecdote in the preceding section was willing to take the
risk of rejection by calling on and meeting people face-to-face. Her competi-
tor, even though she was the market’s dominant force at the time, was unwill-
ing to subject herself to the potential rejection. Of all the approaches I’ve
seen, I believe that establishing more personal contact is the easiest, most
cost-effective way to move to a position of dominance in a real estate market.
By taking each of the preceding steps — choosing a market segment, estab-
lishing contact, gaining awareness, establishing personal rapport, going
beyond what’s expected, and daring to be different in your communication
approaches — you’ll penetrate your target market niche and be well on your
way to achieving market dominance within 18 to 24 months.
Conveying Your Competitive Advantage
in Prospect Presentations
The bottom line is that the whole purpose of a prospect presentation is to
establish your competitive advantage. In the least time possible you want to
communicate what makes you different from the more than 1.2 million other
real estate agents in the United States. You want your prospects to see
exactly why they should hire you, what’s in it for them, and why they should
sign your listing agreement with confidence.
278
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Most agents spend the presentation explaining what they’ll do for the client
instead of focusing on the results the client can expect the agent to deliver.
Newspaper ads, Web site pages, home magazines, dazzling flyers, and a lineup
of other marketing items are tactics that, in truth, nearly all agents use in the
normal course of business. However, they’re not competitive advantages. In
fact, you must assume before a listing presentation that every agent will
promise a near-identical marketing plan.
So why will they hire you over the others? They’ll hire you because they see
what’s in it for them. And what’s in it for them is the set of benefits they’ll
receive as a result of your proven competitive position.
Defining your unique competitive position
To differentiate yourself in the field of real estate sales you need to create,
define, and consistently convey a competitive position that positively distin-
guishes you from your competition.
By knowing and exploiting the difference between your products and serv-
ices and those of your competitors you’ll attract more prospects, win more
clients, grow your market share, increase your revenue, expand your profits,
and, eventually, weaken your competitors.
To pinpoint your unique competitive position, answer these questions:
 Do any key statistics set you apart from your competitors and provide
you with a clear point of difference?
 Do any of your Big Three statistics create a unique competitive position?
 What benefits or values will consumers receive only when they deal 
with you?
 Do you have dominant or strong market share in a geographic region?
 Do you specialize in a particular property type, such as small multi-
plexes, or a certain style of home?
 Is your market share success tied to a particular price point?
 When representing sellers, do you achieve quantifiably higher sale
prices?
 When representing buyers, do you achieve quantifiable savings in sales
price, down payment, monthly payment, or interest rate?
279
Chapter 14: Staking Your Competitive Position

Your answers don’t need to lead to 20 unique competitive positions. You only
need half a dozen reasons why the consumer — whether you’re presenting 
to a buyer or a seller — should choose you over everyone else. Focus only on
advantages that matter to your prospect. Keep in mind the old sales adage: “It’s
easier to sell someone what they want to buy than what you have to sell them.”
Proving your excellence: You don’t 
get paid for second place
A Fortune 500 company CEO who doesn’t increase his company’s revenue
will likely watch the company’s stock price plummet. A quarterback who
throws for lots of yards but doesn’t win games will be benched or traded. A
real estate agent who doesn’t sell listings or find and secure the right home
for buyers will be pushed out of the business.
In the real estate world, results are the name of the game.
Anyone can make money in a steady marketplace where everyone wants to
buy and sell, but only the excellent agents thrive in a competitive market-
place. Follow the advice in this chapter to define, present, and defend your
unique competitive position and to secure your place in the group of excel-
lent agents who consistently increase their market share and enhance their
market dominance.

Keeping Clients for Life
In This Chapter
 Realizing your client’s lifetime value
 Creating lasting, loyal client relationships
 Winning client loyalty with an amazing after-the-sale service program
E
very businessperson wants to win clients for life and for a good reason: 
It costs energy, time, and money to gain a prospect’s awareness, win his
attention, convince him of your benefits, and bring him into your business
circle through an initial sale. If that first sale is the only sale you ever make
with the prospect, your sales investment has only a one-time payoff. But if
that client buys from you on a repeated basis — and refers others to you as
well — your investment grows with each transaction and money-making
opportunity.
The key to winning clients for life is to avoid suffering defections, such as
when a customer decides to buy or sell with another agent or when a client
doesn’t join your referral team.
Professionals in other businesses sometimes have an easier time keeping
clients in their business circles simply because they have more opportunities
to see and serve their customers. For instance, a car dealership sells a car
and then, even if the buyer doesn’t purchase another car for an entire decade,
the dealership has the opportunity to see the customer face to face every
time the vehicle is due for service, oil changes, or tire rotations.
Like a car salesperson, a real estate agent makes big sales to clients on an
infrequent basis. The difference is that in real estate, after-the-sale service
isn’t automatic. You have to create strategies to keep in contact with your
clients and to continually remind them of the value you deliver. This chapter
helps you do just that.

Achieving Relationship Excellence
As a real estate agent, your success depends on the quality and durability of
the relationships you build with your clients, and the one and only way to
build solid, enduring relationships is to deliver excellent, unrivaled service.
To be an outstanding agent you need to lavish your clients (from the get-go
and throughout the long haul) with service that exceeds their expectations.
The challenge is that not all clients expect or want the same kind of service.
What constitutes excellent service to one client may seem inadequate or
even like overkill to another. You may not believe it, but an agent could sell a
client’s home in less than one week, at full price, and still have a dissatisfied
customer due to some action during the negotiation, inspection, or closing
that simply didn’t match with the client’s service expectations.
To avoid service mismatches, figure out each person’s service expectations
by doing something that few agents take time to do: Ask. Then put your find-
ings to work by following these suggestions:
 Find out each person’s service expectations. Before you enter a new
prospect presentation, make it a rule to discover everything you can
about what your prospects are looking for in an agent and how they
define excellent service. For help, refer to the prospect qualifying tech-
niques in Chapter 9. Keep in mind that many times there are two people
making the decision to work with you as their agent. Be sure to under-
stand each one’s service expectation.
 Customize and personalize your service delivery. In your initial presen-
tation and in subsequent contacts — whether you’re working to make the
sale, providing service to the client, building an after-the-sale relationship,
or requesting a referral — refer to your initial research and highlight the
service aspects that each client finds important.
Weave in the words you heard the client use to define great service, and
highlight the communication points he described as essential service
attributes. Let him know that you understand his needs and are focused
on exceeding his expectations.
 Never become complacent. Don’t assume that your best clients will
simply turn a blind eye if your service falls a bit short. And by all means,
don’t think that your clients will say something to you if they want more
or better service. They won’t say anything because they don’t want to
endure the confrontation. They’d rather just go away quietly and never
come back.
282
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

I’ve met agents who are successful in spite of their “my way or the highway”
approach to service delivery. Rather than focusing on customized service and
long-term relationships, these agents prefer to serve a stream of here-today-
gone-tomorrow clients that they acquire through relentless prospecting and
high-volume lead development. These agents have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude
about service. They practice what I call a fast-food joint philosophy: “We sell
hamburgers and fries and if you don’t like hamburgers and fries, pick another
restaurant.” The difference, of course, is that the number of people who want
hamburgers and fries is huge, and if the fare is good, most customers automat-
ically come back for more. The same is hardly true when it comes to home-
buyers and sellers. While this approach does create sales, it does not build
business for the future. This approach creates fewer referrals and less lever-
age, so the agent will need to prospect relentlessly during their whole career.
As an agent, your prospect universe is limited, and your customers aren’t apt
to become repeat customers unless you treat them with the kind of unparal-
leled, consistent, and customized service that turns them into clients for life.
(For an example of how you can build your business through relationship
excellence, see the sidebar titled “Leveraging your client relationships.”)
283
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life
Leveraging your client relationships
Real estate agents can build business in one of
two ways: Through nonstop prospecting and
high-volume lead development that results in
one-time clients, or through development of
high-quality, durable client relationships that
are leveraged into long-term business opportu-
nities and invaluable referral sources. In a
heartbeat, I’d suggest you take the latter route,
and the following example demonstrates why.
Say that over your first decade in the real estate
business you serve, on average, 36 clients a
year. In other words, over the course of your first
10 years you help 360 clients into their homes.
If you close each of those deals, cash your 
commission check, and never look back, all
your effort will add up to exactly 360 business
transactions.
But if you cultivate those 360 clients with excel-
lent after-the-sale service and the kind of 
genuine concern that results in long-term rela-
tionships, you can turn your 360 past clients into
a future-business gold mine, both in terms of
repeat business and referral opportunities.
The National Association of Realtors recently
conducted research proving that the average
consumer moves once every eight years. With
that fact in mind, divide your 360 past clients by
eight and you’ll see that 45 of your past clients
are likely to move in any given year. In other
words, your own client base represents 45 new
business opportunities — provided that you’ve
maintained strong relationships with each one.
And it’s impossible to even count the number of
referrals that come from 360 totally satisfied
past customers.

Defining your service standards
One of the keys to relationship excellence is to define and communicate the
kind of service you stand for before you share service delivery responsibility
To help you define the level of service you want your clients to receive,
answer the following questions:
 How frequently do you communicate with sellers?
• How frequently do you make calls, send e-mail, or mail written
reports?
• What is your process for sending sellers copies of your ads for
their property?
• Do you provide sellers with links to virtual tours or to Web sites
promoting their property?
• How often do you meet face to face, and do the meetings take
place in the sellers’ home or in your office?
The number one complaint consumers have about real estate agents isn’t
that they charge or make too much money. The number one complaint is
that they’re bad or infrequent communicators. If you’re representing the
seller, understand that your client wants consistent communication. If
you aren’t making a weekly call to provide an update on the process of
the sale, you risk a poor customer relationship.
 How do you receive and share showing feedback?
• Do you call the showing agent once, twice, or three times in hopes
of a response, or do you keep calling until you reach the agent and
receive feedback?
• Do you relay showing feedback to the seller right away, or do you
collect feedback to share in a once-a-week meeting?
 What marketing strategy do you employ for each property you list?
• What steps do you take to expose the home to cooperating agents?
• What tools or systems do you employ to raise awareness of your
listed property within the real estate community?
• How do you generate awareness and interest within the public
pool of real estate buyers?
• What marketing techniques and systems do you use to attract
qualified buyers to your seller’s property?
• In what order do you execute your marketing plan?
See Chapter 12 for more guidance on marketing.

Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

By delivering excellent service on a consistent and ongoing basis, your cur-
rent client relationships will spawn repeat business and referrals that can
draw new clients into your business. As a result, your success will reap even
more success, your business will grow bigger, and you’ll be expected to pro-
vide superb service to an ever-growing number of people. At some point
you’ll face the important but difficult task of transitioning from an individual
service provider to a service provider who works with a team that helps com-
municate with and serve clients.
Making the shift from do-it-yourself service delivery to delivery that’s lever-
aged through a team is an essential turning point in a successful agent’s busi-
ness. However, it’s also a dangerous point for the following reasons:
 Even though you know it’s necessary to leverage your service ability 
by assigning tasks to others on your team, you may find it difficult to
release ownership. This inability to let go can result in service lapses
and frustration among both staff members and clients.
 Unless you clearly establish and communicate your service philosophy
and program to those on your team, you’ll risk delivering an inconsis-
tent or lower level of service to your clients.
Figures 15-1 and 15-2 toward the end of this chapter help you as you create
checklists that everyone on your team can use and follow. Once you’re clear
about what you stand for and how you deliver service to clients, you’re in a
position to train those on your team to deliver that same service on your
behalf and, of course, to your standards. At that point, your transition from 
a one-person service provider to professional service team is complete.
Congratulations!
Promising, and then flawlessly delivering
It’s one thing to have a service delivery plan. It’s another thing to actually
implement your plan on a never-fail basis. I’ve seen marketing packages from
countless agents, and most of them include 15-point, 21-point, or 30-point 
service action plans provided by the national franchise or large company 
the agent works for. I always ask, “Do you really do all of these things?” The
sheepish response from most agents is that they implement and do fewer
than 30 percent of the service tasks listed on their marketing plans.
The truth is that most agents don’t follow through for two reasons:
 They over-promise.
 They lose track of what they said they’d do because they lack a concrete
system to follow.
285
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

Here’s my advice: Go through the multi-point action plan you currently use
and separate out the highest-value activities that you know you can perform
with total consistency. Then commit to flawlessly performing those tasks 
and to performing others when you can. In other words, be ready to under-
promise and over-deliver.
The separation between marginal performance and stellar performance doesn’t
come from an abundance of magical extras. Instead, it’s the result of keeping
your commitments. For the vast majority of consumers, a professional who
keeps commitments is a rarity.
Viewing the closing as a starting 
point, not a finish line
Great agents know that their job isn’t over when the transaction closes. After
you’ve achieved the sale, closed the deal, cashed the commission check, and
spent the money, it’s time to start fortifying your client relationship. Sure you
need to get on to the next income-producing activity. But, as you cultivate
your next deal, don’t make the mistake of turning your back on the clients
you just served.
In fact, your clients could need you more after their closing than at any previ-
ous point in your relationship for any of the following reasons:
 After moving into their new home, the clients may have discovered
repair issues that need attention. They may need the name of someone
who can fix their roof, or they may want names of service providers that
do quality work and are honest, trustworthy, and fair.
 Their home taxes may have shot up substantially and they may need
you to evaluate the marketplace, research comparable properties, and
complete a report of your findings that they can use to contest the
increase in their property’s taxable value.
 Your clients’ home purchase may have sparked their interest in build-
ing wealth through real estate investments. They may be thinking about
how to secure their retirement or how to create a nest egg for their chil-
dren’s college educations. If your clients view real estate as a piece in
their build-the-wealth puzzle, they may seek your advice about how to
acquire and retain properties as a key step toward wealth creation.
 Your clients may simply be interested in how the market around them
is doing. When you call these clients to chat, you’re likely to get the ques-
tion, “What’s happening in the marketplace?” Now that they’re homeown-
ers, your clients are vested in the local real estate marketplace. Become
their resource and you’ll be first in line when they’re ready to make the
next physical or investment move.

After reading this list you may wonder why an agent needs to be told that the
closing must be viewed as the first step toward securing a long client rela-
tionship and countless service opportunities. The reason is that research
shows this is an area of agent deficiency.
The National Association of Realtors completed a study over a series of years to
gauge the public’s perception of real estate agents. They found that 69 percent
of consumers rate the service they received from their agent as satisfactory or
better. However, only 24 percent of clients used the same agent on an upcoming
deal that they used on their previous transaction. The fact that fewer than one
out of four clients went back to use the same agent, even though the majority of
clients felt that their previous transaction was handled satisfactorily, is a shock-
ing testimony to the fact that agents aren’t developing long-term relationships.
And from here, the figures get even worse. In 2004, the total number of real
estate transactions hit an all-time high, resulting in 6.8 million sales in a single
year. Of those 6.8 million sales, 21 percent, or approximately 1.4 million deals,
involved experienced buyers and sellers who conducted investment or second
home transactions. When asked whether they used an agent they had previ-
ously worked with, only 13 percent, or 884,000 of these experienced clients, 
said yes. A full 87 percent, or 5.9 million sales, were handled by an agent the
consumer had never used before.
These stats reek of poor after-the-sale communication and woefully short
relationship development. The only logical conclusion is that, in general,
after-the-sale service in the real estate industry really stinks. The next 
section helps you break the stereotype.
Creating After-the-Sale Service
If you don’t plan for it, after-the-sale service won’t happen. You’ll get so con-
sumed with the next deal and with the task of earning the next commission
check that you’ll overlook the opportunity to create long-term revenue
through your past clients.
An after-the-sale service program is like many things in life: difficult to start
and difficult to maintain. People get derailed before they take the first step
and if they don’t take the first step — the step that involves establishing the
program they commit to follow — they can’t begin to meet the objective.
Use this section to guide you as you create your own after-the-sale service
plan. It helps you define exactly what you need to do in the first 30 days after
the sale, and shows you how to maintain the plan on an ongoing basis.
287
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

Laying the groundwork during 
the transaction period
When working a real estate transaction, you have two prime opportunities to
develop interpersonal connections and high-grade referrals:
 During the transaction period when you’re working with your client to
buy or sell a home and close the deal
 During the 30 to 45 days that follow the closing
If you do a poor job during the transaction you’ll be hard pressed to recover
lost ground after the closing. An attorney that blows a case doesn’t get a
second chance from the client, and the same holds true for real estate agents.
Your service during the transaction must be stellar or you’ll sacrifice the
chance for repeat and referral business, which is the easiest and least costly
business to acquire. If that isn’t bad enough, you’ll also lose the opportunity
to collect client testimonials and generate positive word-of-mouth.
During the transaction period you’re in frequent contact with your clients
and have ample opportunities to provide excellent service; make a strong,
positive impression; and develop the basis for a long-term relationship. For
instance:
 When you first begin to work with clients to buy or sell a home, their
enthusiasm is high. They fully anticipate and expect that they’ll be able
to find a buyer or the perfect home and that you’re the ideal agent to
accomplish the task. During this initial period, your clients think about
little other than their real estate hopes. Your presence becomes woven
into the fabrics of their lives and their conversations with friends and
family members. This is an ideal time to ask for and win referrals. For
more on asking for referrals, turn to Chapter 6.
 If the sale or purchase process drags on, expect your clients’ level of
excitement and energy to ebb. At the same time, expect their focus on
their purchase or sale to intensify. The most important thing you can do
during this potentially dangerous time — when your clients are experi-
encing concern and talking nonstop about their real estate issues with
others — is to stay in frequent communication, offer solutions, provide
calm, professional advice, and retain the clients’ confidence in you and
your abilities.
Refer to the section “Defining your service standards” earlier in this chapter
as you establish a plan that ensures frequent and professional contact
throughout the transaction period.
288
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Setting a service agenda for the 
first 30 days after the sale
If you did everything right during the transaction (which I’m going to assume
you did), then your clients were likely totally satisfied with your service when
the deal closed. Now you have a decision to make: Do you wish your clients
well and walk away, or do you begin an after-the-sale service program that
turns them into clients for life? You’ve seen this chapter’s title, so you already
know the answer: You begin turning them into clients for life. How? I’m glad
you asked.
Calling your clients regularly
Begin by personally calling your clients at least four times during the 30 days
after the closing. Following are some suggestions:
 Call in the first few days after the closing to thank them for allowing
you the opportunity to serve them. Tell them how excited you are 
for them to be moving into their new home. Share an anecdote about
working with them that will make you all laugh and that will touch their
hearts.
After the call, send a hand-written thank-you note further expressing
your thanks and asking for future business or referrals.
 By the end of the first week, call again. Once again, thank them for
trusting and allowing you to be their agent. Then ask how the move went
and whether anything got broken. You can also ask whether the kids like
their new rooms and whether they’ve met any of the neighborhood kids
yet. Finally, find out whether the seller left the home properly, which
allows you to ask whether your clients need your help with anything.
This last question can open a Pandora’s box of issues, and that’s exactly
the reason to ask it. If the sellers caused problems when they left and
you don’t know about them, you may be blamed for the mishaps without
any opportunity to make them right. Most issues will be between the
seller and the buyer, and, unfortunately, power over the seller — unless
legal action is involved — is gone because the transaction has closed.
Sometimes all you can do is provide a listening ear and sympathetic
voice. Other times you can make a few phone calls to help right the
wrong. The fact that you’re willing to listen and try to help speaks louder
than any demonstrable action — it shows that you care.
At the conclusion of the second call, send another hand-written note.
Express concern for the unresolved issue, and again thank them for their
trust and for taking the time to talk with you.
289
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

 Call again at the two-week mark. Ask how the unpacking is going and
how they’re settling into their new home. Update them if you’ve made
progress on the issue that was concerning them. Ask about the kids and
their transition. Before hanging up, ask if your service is needed. Also,
ask them for referrals.
 On their 30-day anniversary in the home, call again. Congratulate
them on their great decision in selecting this home. Check on the kids
and their progress settling in to the house and neighborhood. Thank
them again for the honor to serve them.
This approach sounds simple, but don’t underestimate the power it has in
enabling you to lock your clients in for life. You’ll not only gain a lifelong
client, but you’ll also open the door to referral business that flows freely.
Calling the other buyer or seller involved in the transaction
While you’re at it, call the other party involved in your real estate transaction
as well.
Every real estate deal involves a buyer and a seller. In most cases you repre-
sent only one of the two parties, but why not call and offer after-sales service
to both? Do you think the other agent is doing this? For your answer, you
only have to look at the National Association of Realtors’ 2004 finding that
only 13 percent of real estate clients used an agent they had used previously
to represent their interests. My estimation is that fewer than 10 percent of
agents actually call their clients after closing.
When calling to follow up with the party represented by the other agent in
your transaction, be ready for a response of surprise and great appreciation.
The fact that you’re willing to call four times in one month, while the agent
who got paid to represent their interests hasn’t called even once, will posi-
tively awe most people. By the end of your 30-day after-sale service period,
the names of the other agent’s clients will be in your database, and you’ll be
the one receiving their referrals.
Sending your client a gift
You may want to consider delivering or sending a gift to your client, congrat-
ulating them on their new home and thanking them for letting you do busi-
ness with them. This gift is usually called a closing gift.
Don’t take the gift with you to the closing. Here’s why:
 At the closing, your clients will be focused on the transaction and think-
ing about their impending move and all the challenges that lie in front of
them. Your gift will get lost in the shuffle.
290
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

 The papers presented at the closing put the amount of the real estate
commission in writing, causing your clients to focus on exactly how
much money you made from the transaction (see the upcoming sidebar,
“The problem with commissions,” for more on this topic). If you give
your gift at the same time, they could make a negative comparison
between the value of the gift and the money you received.
If you want to give them something at closing, give them a hand-written
thank-you note.
Personally, I think that sending a closing gift is optional. For many agents,
doing so is common practice. However, other agents view their services as
similar to those of doctors, dentists, attorneys, and so on — you don’t usually
get a gift basket from your surgeon after he does your gall bladder surgery. If
you feel that sending a gift is a useful tool for opening the door to future busi-
ness and referrals, by all means go for it, but never think that you have to.
If you have decided that giving a closing gift is a strategy that you’re going to
implement in your business to open the door of referrals, here are some sug-
gestions for finding the right gift to use:
 In choosing your gift, don’t go overboard. Save any over-the-top ges-
tures you may want to extend until after your clients have settled in and
after your commission has long-since been paid. The more you deliver
after you get paid, the more your gift communicates that you care about
your clients, not just your commission check.
 Find a closing gift that reminds clients of you and your service. Give
them something that can be used rather than consumed. A great bottle
of wine or gift basket quickly disappears. A customized mailbox, door
knocker, or yard plant will last almost forever.
 Deliver the gift to your clients’ new home. By taking or delivering your
gift to your clients’ new home, you’ll put it in their hands at a time when it
can create the most significant feelings of goodwill, warmth, and referrals.
Another nice gesture is to help your clients notify their friends of their move.
Offer to create and print a couple hundred postcards with a picture of their
new home on the front. Then offer to mail them out on your clients’ behalf.
You’ll save them the cost of postage, and you’ll enlarge your database to
boot. You may even call people on the list to make sure they received the
card you sent for your client. You could then offer them a market conditions
report that you create for your clients for free (turn to Chapter 4 to find out
how to research and understand your marketplace). Ask them if they would
like that mailed or e-mailed to them. You’re hoping that they say e-mail, so
you can get their e-mail address. This first step can lead to a relationship
with a new potential prospect.
291
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

Establishing an ongoing 
communication strategy
After your clients have completed their moves and put their real estate trans-
actions behind them, you still need to be in touch at regular intervals if you
want to remain on their radar screens.
Unless you develop a pattern of frequent communication with phone calls,
e-mail, direct mailings, and other forms of contact, too many clients (even
your best ones) may not remember you at the important moment when they
need real estate counsel or when their friends need it. You need to constantly
remind them that you’re still in the business and ready to be of assistance.
I have a coaching client in New Jersey who happens to be one of the best
agents in his state. During a recent conversation he shared with me his disap-
pointment with the number of referrals he was receiving from past clients. He
follows a good system to communicate with his clients frequently, but when
it came to referrals the results weren’t what he wanted. He emphasized his
frustration by saying that he had been in the business for seven years and
hadn’t received a single referral from his own mother! I followed up with an
obvious question: “Have you ever asked her for a referral?” His response was
similar to the one I hear from most agents: “She’s my mother. She knows I’m
in real estate. I didn’t think I had to ask.” You can replace the word mother
292
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 
The problem with commissions
When closing time arrives, sellers basically
receive, right there on the closing papers, a bill
for the agent’s services. By the time they see
that big 6 percent figure staring them in the
face, chances are they’ve already forgotten the
risk you took with your time and money to
market their home. When they see how much
the commission slices into their home proceeds,
they’ve likely forgotten about many of the ser-
vices you provided. Not to mention they never
even knew about the other countless efforts you
provided — calls to lenders, title companies,
attorneys, repair contractors, other agents,
appraisers, and all the other partners involved
to achieve the sale, or purchase, of the clients’
home. Since most agents do little after the sale,
the clients’ parting memory is how much you
got paid, which isn’t exactly a great way to
launch a long-term relationship.
I really believe that the way we collect our
income, or fee, makes it more difficult to
achieve warm feelings from our clients, and I
think it hardly encourages customer retention.
However, I’m not advocating changing the com-
pensation structure. In fact, I’m a true believer
in the plan. But I caution you to remain aware of
its inherent challenges and to make doubly sure
that your last contact with your clients isn’t on
the day you get paid. After-the-sale service is
the best antidote.

with best friend, little brother, older sister, favorite cousin, aunt, father, wife’s
boss, accountant, attorney, pastor . . . you get the idea. The lesson is exactly
the same. You may think that the people you know should remember your
business and assume that you welcome referrals, but they don’t. That’s why
ongoing communication is essential.
Now here’s the rest of my coaching client’s story. He agreed to add to his
upcoming week’s action plan a call to his mother, during which he’d ask for a
referral. The next time we talked, he seemed subdued. When I asked if some-
thing was wrong, he answered sheepishly, “I called my mother. A day later,
she called me with a referral. I’ve already listed and sold that home. She called
me yesterday with another, and I’m going out tonight to list that home.” He’d
waited seven years to get his first two listings and sales from his mother’s
referrals.
If my coaching client’s mother can forget to recommend her own son because
he lacked an ongoing communication strategy, anyone can forget you’re an
agent (or may not realize the importance of referrals). See Chapter 6 to find
out the best way to ask for a referral.
Using direct mail
Direct mail is still one of the best ways to generate business, but only if it gets
to the right people and only if it gets opened and read (instead of thrown
directly in the trash with the other junk mail). To get your mail to the right
people, create a carefully developed list that includes the addresses of past
clients and people within your sphere of influence, which basically consists
of the people you know.
To get your mail opened, make it look personal. People sort their mail with
the garbage can close by. They rifle through the pile and within seconds put
pieces into an A pile that definitely gets attention, a B pile that has a 50/50
chance of getting opened, or straight into the trash. You should strive to get
into the A pile.
293
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life
Don’t let distance become a barrier
Too often agents make the mistake of ignoring
people that have moved out of their area. Some
sales training programs even advocate forget-
ting about them. I find that approach to be short-
sighted. Most people continue relationships
with others even after moving away. This is
especially true with the advent of e-mail com-
munication. My advice is to keep calling and
sending e-mail newsletters as you usually
would for other clients. These people may send
referrals, move back, or even move somewhere
else. You could refer them to an agent who
could sell their home or help them find another
home and receive a referral fee for doing so.
Not a bad way to earn 25 percent of the com-
mission for each sale by keeping in touch.

To get your mail into the A pile, try putting these tips to work:
 Send your correspondence on notecard-sized stationery. Notecard
stock is very different in size and quality from the bulk of other mail, 
so it naturally stands out. The notecard stock seems like an invitation 
to something special. This approach makes clients feel different and 
special, and it starts the minute they see the envelope.
 Handwrite the envelope address. To avoid sending mail that resembles
junk mail, don’t use computer labels. If you have to use labels because
your writing resembles hieroglyphics, use clear labels that are almost
invisible. At a glance, clear labels allow your address to appear typed
onto the envelope.
 Send special occasion cards. Use the clients’ anniversary, the anniver-
sary of the day they moved into their home, Mother’s Day, Father’s Day,
and birthdays to reinforce your connection with the clients and to
remind them that you care. Also send thank-you or “just-thinking-
about-you” cards.
 Send mail to their children. Separate yourself from nearly all of your
clients’ other business contacts by taking an interest in their children. I
didn’t understand the value of this connection until I had children. Now I
know firsthand that someone who transfers value, service, and kindness
to my kids is someone who will get my business forever. Send your clients’
children birthday cards. Include a certificate for a treat at the local ice
cream parlor and you’ll really get noticed, both by the kids and their
parents.
Don’t expect your direct mail program to just happen spontaneously. Plan it
out a year in advance. Select about a half a dozen dates over the course of
the year to send handwritten cards to past clients or people in your sphere.
Program the dates and nature of the mailers into your database to remind
you when to do it. Just make sure to follow through.
Staying in touch via e-mail
E-mail provides an easy and cost-effective way to deliver correspondence to
your prospects and clients. To be as effective as possible, create a list full of
addresses of recipients who want to receive your mailings. However, make sure
that new prospects have given you permission to send them your mailings.
I suggest that you establish at least two databases of e-mail addresses:
 One database should include the names and addresses of all
prospects that have given you permission to send them e-mail mes-
sages. When you send e-mail to this set of people you’re trying to gener-
ate interest and confidence and to coax them into a working relationship
with you. The text in their messages is sales-oriented and articulates
reasons why they should immediately take action in the real estate
294
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

market. Mailers may focus on appreciation rates, inventory levels, inter-
est rates, and projections of future rate increases. Additionally, each
mailer should include a concise statement about the value of doing busi-
ness with you, why they should hire you, and the benefits they’ll receive
from working with you instead of the competition.
 A second database should include the names and addresses of past
clients and those in your sphere of influence, which includes friends,
family members, and professional associates. When mailing to this
group, tone down your sales message. You still want to provide an update
on current and emerging market conditions, and most certainly you still
want to convey the value you deliver, but you want to do it all with a
softer, more personal approach. Your purpose when mailing to this group
is to generate referrals. By sharing marketplace facts, you provide them
with information they can use in their conversations with their friends.
When compiling your databases, make sure that you obtain and include
e-mail addresses for each person you want to reach in a home or business.
For instance, my wife and I each have our own e-mail addresses. If you only
send to my e-mail address, she would never see your mailer because I wouldn’t
take the time to forward it to her. I guarantee that we’re not an unusual couple
in this respect.
When mailing to your prospects, put the following advice to work:
 Send a monthly newsletter. Choose a template from your word process-
ing program or one of the countless third party resources. Then all you
have to do is fill in the text area with your customized message.
 Develop content that is solid, helpful, positive, and valuable. The text
doesn’t have to be earthshaking in terms of news value. And it doesn’t
have to be written in award-winning prose. It just needs to be current,
customized to your local market conditions, and capable of making a
good impression over the few minutes between when it’s opened and
when it’s deleted.
Note: It should be free of spelling and grammatical errors, however.
Nothing shows a lack of intelligence or attention to detail as correspon-
dence with poor spelling and grammar. If you’re like me and aren’t
skilled in grammar and sentence construction, make sure that you have
someone who can help you make your correspondence look top notch.
 Avoid e-mail blasts that send the identical message to a long list of
addresses. The exception is when you’re sending a newsletter or news
flash to your full list. In all other cases, work to personalize the notes
you send. Your clients are well-versed in e-mail and know exactly how
much (or little) time and effort goes into a communication that involves
absolutely no personalization. Subconsciously, they’ll translate the mass
mailing as a definition of the quality of your relationship with them. For
that reason alone, use mass e-mailings sparingly.
295
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

When e-mailing market updates, don’t become lazy when relaying market
facts. When the MLS shares that the average home price went from $205,458
to $221,497 over the last year, the numbers really don’t mean much to clients
or prospects. But if you take the time to do some math, you can tip your
e-mail recipients off to the fact that home prices in the local market area
increased by 7 percent in the past 12 months. That kind of figure is memo-
rable and gets passed along, with your name as the source.
Spam, or e-mail that isn’t requested or wanted by the recipient, is the dirge of
the online world. In 2003, the U.S. federal government passed the CAN-SPAM
Act, which requires, among other things, that anyone who sends commercial
unsolicited e-mail must follow some clearly stated rules. The mailer must be
clearly identified, it must include a valid physical postal address, it must pre-
sent a means for the recipient to opt-out or unsubscribe, and the person or
organization sending the mailer must honor unsubscribe requests within a
specific time frame. Be sure your mailings comply.
Picking up the phone
In your effort to stay in touch, add value, and generate referrals, you want to
pick up the phone and call some of your contacts weekly, some monthly, and
maybe some only one time each year. If you don’t reach them, leave a message
so they have a record that you called them. To organize the effort, create phone
lists that are segmented by the level of connection and frequency of contact you
have with each group. Use the following as guidelines:
 Your star clients and closest friends and associates deserve star treat-
ment. These people are sold on you and the service you provide. They
want to help you advance your career. They’re happy to hear from you
and they’re likely to send you more referrals than any other group on
your contact list. It’s okay to treat them differently from everyone else.
In fact, it’s good business. Call the people in this category monthly or at
least one time every other month, and weave a referral request into each
conversation.
 Past clients and those in your sphere of influence should be called at
least once a year. Unless you have an enormous database, anyone you
have serviced in your career should hear from you personally and over
the phone at least once every 12 months.
Don’t hesitate to pick up the phone and make calls just to thank people for
their business, see how they’re doing, and ask if you can do anything for
them. Most consumers, when called by a service provider, are delighted and
honored by the contact. If you got a friendly call out of the blue from your
insurance agent, attorney, accountant, or financial advisor, you’d be both 
surprised and pleased. The same is likely to be the case when you call your
clients.
296
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Showing appreciation
The National Association of Realtors now includes more than 1.3 million
members. Obviously your clients have a choice! Do you thank them often
enough for choosing you?
I have to admit that I’ve become aware of how little common courtesy is
extended in our society as the result of our efforts to instill the “magic”
words — “please” and “thank you” — into the conversations of our four-year-
old son, Wesley. I’m amazed at the positive responses we receive from wait-
ers, grocery store clerks, bank tellers, and other service providers. They
heap praise about what a polite little boy he is when he displays courtesies
that should be standard fare in everyday exchanges.
From watching the reactions to my son, I’m more certain than ever that you
can set yourself apart by conveying courtesy and appreciation to your clients
on an ongoing basis. Express thanks several times during the transaction and
again after the closing. Say thank you every time clients sign anything like 
a listing agreement, buyer agency contract, or an offer or counter offer.
Frequently affirm that they’ve made a good decision by working with you 
or choosing to buy their home.
The power of a thank-you note
I truly believe the most powerful force in the business world is a handwritten
thank-you note. That may sound terribly “old school” to techno-savvy agents,
but it’s exactly what you need to send if you want to set yourself apart.
I remember my mother sitting down with me and my two brothers at the
kitchen table each year after Christmas to write thank-you notes for the gifts
we received. Over our protests, she insisted that by accepting the gifts, we
accepted the responsibility to write a thank-you note.
Back then, writing thank-you notes was a standard operating procedure.
Today, thank-you notes are rare, and as a result they carry far more weight.
They convey, in essence, “You matter so much that I took the time to craft a
message with my own hand.”
Select note cards that are simple both inside and outside. If you work for a
national franchise there will be hundreds to choose from in multiple cata-
logues that encompass your company’s logos. Don’t select cards with too
many words on the inside. The words on the inside should be your own. 
The key is handwritten and notecard size not letter size.
Exceeding expectations
The keys to exceeding expectations are few and pretty obvious: Extend cour-
tesy. Say thanks. Demonstrate appreciation. And always be professional and
keep in mind that little gestures go a long way toward building strong rela-
tionships. You don’t have to go overboard. Small gifts like ice cream cone 
297
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

certificates for the children, movie tickets for the adults, or coffee shop
coupons make the point that you appreciate working with your contacts and
receiving their referrals, whether they result in business or not.
My only caution is to be sure that every gesture you make further enhances
your professional reputation. A few years back, the Wall Street Journal fea-
tured a profile on the service styles of three real estate agents. One bought
groceries for out-of-town clients before they arrived to enjoy their vacation
home. Another would personally mow the lawns of out-of-area sellers. A third
reduced his fees to accommodate client requests. Each exceeded expecta-
tions in a way that lowered the professionalism and status of the real estate
agent community. I can’t think of a doctor, dentist, attorney, or accountant
that would provide these types of services to exceed expectations.
Keep your efforts in line with your professional image — you don’t want to be
known as a personal shopper or a lawn boy. Getting groceries for out-of-town
clients is thoughtful but inappropriate for a professional. However, helping

Customizing your messages
From an early age, every child learns the Golden Rule: Treat others the way
you want to be treated. Customer service pros replace the Golden Rule with
the Platinum Rule: Treat others the way they want to be treated.
The Platinum Rule was coined by speaker and trainer Tony Alessandra, who
explains that a salesperson’s job isn’t to treat and serve clients as you want
to be treated but as they want to be treated. The only way to know how a
person wants to be treated is to ask and observe. Different kinds of cus-
tomers have different values and service expectations. A one-time transac-
tion client expects a different level of attention than is expected by a long-time
relationship client. A busy executive expects more efficiency than is expected,
or even desired, by a person with a fairly empty calendar.
By discovering and recognizing a person’s communication style, decision-
making style, and expectations, you can supercharge your business. Visit

approach to business building and client building.
The difference between junk mail and personal mail boils down to a single
question: Is the message targeted and tailored to the interests of the recipient,
or could it just as easily have been sent out to any other home in the city?”
The more you segment your database, the better you’ll be able to customize
the messages you send. Prospects, clients, and those in your sphere have dif-
ferent information needs. Likewise, those with various interests will respond
to different kinds of messages.

Segment your mailing list by the nature of your relationship with the contact
and also by the recipients’ lifestyle facts, such as age group, special interests,
spiritual faith, and whether they have children. Then with a few keystrokes
you can pull up address lists of people with shared interests and information
needs. You can send a great article on golf to all the golfing enthusiasts in
your database. You can send an invitation to a family-oriented event to all
prospects with children. You can be sure that every mailer that leaves your
office conveys that you know and care enough about the recipients’ interests
to send appropriately tailored information.
Establishing Awesome Service
Awesome service is essential to keeping clients for life, and the essentials of
awesome service are positive service encounters, having a service plan, and
making sure you meet the customer’s expectations of what awesome service
is. This section shows you how to do just that.
Ensuring positive service encounters
A service encounter happens any time that a consumer interacts with a servic-
ing organization. Every Web site hit or incoming ad or sign call is a service
encounter. When a prospect talks to anyone on your service team — you,
your staff, your company receptionist, your closing coordinator, or your
broker, owner, lender, escrow or title attorney — he or she is having a service
encounter.
If one person in the long chain of people who help you get your job done says
or does anything negative, it affects the prospect’s impression of the entire
service encounter. You can’t separate yourself from your colleagues if they
mess up. It’s even possible for your service to be tainted by those outside of
your service team. For example, say that a buyer uses a lender other than the
one you recommend. If the transaction closes late and with a higher interest
rate than originally quoted, that client will leave with a bad impression about
the whole transaction and everyone involved in it. Because of the actions of
someone outside of your influence, your future business and referral oppor-
tunities will be on the line.
To direct your service toward superb outcomes, follow these suggestions:
 Control service encounters by using your own people to conduct
transactions. Direct and drive as much business as possible to the best
providers. Work hard to convince the client to use people on your team
when securing a mortgage or closing the deal. Some may call this “steer-
ing,” but I view it as taking care of your clients.
299
Chapter 15: Keeping Clients for Life

 Make sure that your client works with the lenders who know their
stuff and are responsive. Be aware that the lender triggers the choke
point in most transactions. Take time to counsel your client and guide
him toward a resource you know will perform.
 Have a plan for recovering from service disasters. If your client is rea-
sonable, no situation is too far gone to salvage. In fact, handle the prob-
lem well and you’re apt to turn a disgruntled client into one of your most
vocal supporters. Follow these guidelines:
• Do what is necessary to right the wrong. This seems obvious, 
but too many agents fail to heed this advice. For example, if your
ad is wrong for a property, run an additional one even if it costs
you money. If you forgot to ask for the refrigerator as the buyer
asked you to in the offer, buy one for them. You must do what is
required to make the client whole if you make an error.
• Find out from the client what it would take to turn the unsatis-
factory situation into a satisfactory one. Ask what it would take
for them to be delighted. However, be cautious here. I don’t really
believe that forgoing a fee or reducing a cost ever creates a more
satisfied client — they’ll just be unhappy customers with more
money in their pockets. The service and the cost aren’t linked at
this stage of customer satisfaction.
• Avoid the blame game. If you point out that it was the client’s
decision to use the service provider who caused the problem, you
only make the situation worse. Using the I-told-you-so attitude is
never a way to soothe feelings.
• Follow up. Eventually sore feelings will wane, but the only way to
replace the negative impression is to make a better one through con-
tinuous and professional contact. In the early stages after the sale
mishap you may not see many referrals, but when they start to
come through you’ll know that your service recovery plan was a
success.
• If you can’t turn the situation around, don’t concede your profit.
Some clients only feel placated if they get into your pocketbook and
win cash compensation. If you did something that caused them to
be hurt financially, you may have to buck up. However, agents rarely
are the cause of a client’s financial hardship. Before you give up your
hard-earned money, I caution you to ask yourself three questions:
1. Will offering cash really turn this client into a raving fan?
2. Is there another way to turn this client into a raving fan?
3. Is there a reasonable chance that I will win future business and
referrals from this person?
If your answers don’t cause you to feel confident that giving up
money will net a future return at a low risk, keep the cash in your
pocket.

Developing a service plan
The best way to provide the level of service you and your client agreed on is
to create two checklists, a new listing checklist that details the steps you will
follow throughout the process of accepting a listing, and a sale agreement
checklist that details all the steps that happen from contract to close.
Figures 15-1 and 15-2 present samples of each of these checklists to guide you
as you develop forms that work for your own business. Standard procedures
vary from state to state and MLS board to MLS board. While the samples
included in this book will be 90 percent accurate for your situation, you’ll
need to customize them to fit the requirements of your state, region, or local
laws and code of ethics.

Extra touches that create gold-star service
Whole books have been written on the topic of
customer service. For a great resource, pick up
Customer Service For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by
Karen Leland and Keith Bailey (Wiley). The
basis for customer service in real estate is
accomplishing a sale if you represent the seller
or securing the right property for the client if you
represent the buyer. Short of doing those things,
you won’t have a customer to service. This seg-
ment assumes you have done that and want to
provide that little bit extra for your clients.
Ask the agents in your office what extra touches
work for them. Also, ask your broker what
actions she thinks are considered extra touches.
Following are two of my favorites — one that is
extended right after the closing and one that 
is extended to long-term clients:
 Right after closing, arrange for two hours
of complimentary home repair work. The
cost of this extra touch will run only about
$100 and the perceived value is huge. More
often than not, clients will use more time
than the amount covered by your gift, and
so the repairperson will acquire new clients
and will probably give you a great deal on
the time he sells to you as a result.
By sending in a repairperson, you help the
clients resolve small issues that the sellers
didn’t handle before they left. If these issues
aren’t dealt with, they may fester into some-
thing bigger that leads to frustration with
the transaction, which could lead to frus-
tration with you. This idea is an inexpensive
win-win for all involved.
 For long-term clients, consider buying four
season tickets to an event series that you
enjoy in your town — perhaps to the sym-
phony or the theatre or to professional or
college sports games. Be sure that the
events are ones you enjoy attending and
that the activity is consistent with your pro-
fessional image. (Tickets to WWE wrestling
probably won’t make your list.)
Shortly before each of the event dates, invite
clients to attend the event with you. Don’t
issue invitations when you first buy the tick-
ets. Wait until a few days or a week before
each event. At that point your invitation will
seem spontaneous and genuinely friendly.
Some of your invitees will already be booked
and will have to decline. You may have to call
six to ten people to give the tickets away.

Chapter 16
Maximizing Your Time
In This Chapter
 Steering clear of time-wasting activities
 Putting an end to procrastination
 Generating the greatest return on time you invest in your business
T
he most significant challenge in an entrepreneurial business like real estate
sales is managing time effectively. The daily battle against procrastination,
distractions, interruptions, low-priority activities, and ingrained customer
expectations of instant accessibility can exhaust even the most energetic 
agent and can derail the plans of all but the most disciplined time manager.
This chapter helps you to take control of your calendar, which will give you
the time you need to build skills, prospect, follow up with leads, plan and
make quality presentations, market properties, and position and present
yourself successfully. Your ability to manage your days and invest your time
for the highest return will separate you from the other agents who are vying
for top-producer status. Not to mention that managing your calendar also
enables you to earn your desired income.
Spending Less Time to Accomplish More
Many real estate agents invest too much time and too little intensity in their
businesses. They commit well over 40 hours a week to the job and they put
themselves on call seven days a week. They spread themselves thin and then
in order to sustain themselves over this endless schedule, they dilute their
intensity. Few other professionals work so many hours. Even doctors have a
lighter on-call schedule than most agents choose to accept.
I suggest that you commit right now to becoming more effective while work-
ing way fewer hours each week. Consider this advice:

 Set aside at least one day a week to recharge and refresh yourself.
Before you say you can’t afford the day off, realize this truth: Work
expands to fill the time you give it. Reduce your work hours appropri-
ately and you’ll automatically be forced to squeeze more productivity
into shorter spans of time.
 Increase your productivity by increasing your intensity. Give yourself
deadlines with no option for procrastination. If you know you need to
accomplish a lineup of goals over the course of a five-day workweek,
your focus will automatically zoom in, you’ll sweep away distractions,
and you’ll get the job done in the time allowed.
I watched my own focus and productivity intensify as I went from a
seven-day workweek to a six-day workweek to a five-day workweek. The
largest production increase I experienced, though, was when I moved to
a schedule of four days of work followed by three days off. I experienced
no correlating reduction in my income or success objectives during this
transition. How’d I do it? Given my goals, I knew I had to work with
incredibly high intensity and could allow no options for procrastination.
What’s more, I couldn’t change my mind and add a workday to my
schedule because my wife and I were constructing a vacation home
some three hours away in Bend, Oregon, and we had to be on-site every
Friday to check the progress. Joan was the general contractor, so reorga-
nizing the eight-month construction schedule was impossible. You want
to know the most amazing outcome of the situation? Once the home was
done, I saw no need to revert to a five-day workweek.
 Take away your time-wasting options. Commit to taking time off and
working during established, reasonable work hours. Automatically,
you’ll force yourself to eliminate time-wasting activities like too much
socializing in the office or lunch with people trying to sell you their 
services.
 Give yourself no option to add hours back to your workweek. If you
allow yourself the option to add time back to your workweek, you leave
yourself open to time-wasting choices.
 Begin treating time as your most valuable asset. Real estate agents
tend to be too casual with their time, which leads to career, relationship,
or bank account casualties that could’ve been avoided by treating time
as the most precious resource in their life.
A resource is something that’s available in a limited or finite supply.
Money and energy are among your personal resources, but time is your
most precious resource of all. You can judge your resource supply in all
other areas. You know, or can easily figure out, how much money is in
your bank account. You know or sense your energy levels and what you
have left to use.

Applying Pareto’s Principle: 
The 80:20 Rule
In the late 1800s, an Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto observed that in
Italy a small group of people held nearly all the power, influence, and money,
which they used to create a significant advantage over the rest of the popula-
tion. He theorized that in most countries about 80 percent of the wealth and
power was controlled by about 20 percent of the people. He called this a
“predictable imbalance,” which eventually became known as the 80:20 rule.
Throughout the 1900s, researchers realized that the 80:20 rule applies across
many fields of expertise. Most certainly, it’s true when it comes to time
investment, and here’s what that means to you:
 80 percent of your results will be generated by 20 percent of your
efforts. Conversely, 20 percent of your results will be generated by 80
percent of your efforts. In other words, one-fifth of your time-consuming
activities will deliver four-fifths of your gross sales or gross commissions.
 You can increase the productivity that results from your time investment
by assessing which activities achieve the highest-quality results. Too
many agents allow their time to be consumed by activities that generate a
mere 20 percent of their revenue. The moment they shift their time invest-
ment into higher-return activities, they see dramatic income results.
The 80:20 rule holds true across a spectrum of life activities. Whether you’re
investing in your career, relationships, health, wealth, or personal develop-
ment, 20 percent of your efforts will deliver 80 percent of the results you
seek. The secret is to figure out which activities deliver the highest-quality
returns and to invest your time accordingly.
As a real estate agent, do you make time for the few activities that return the
most significant results? Or are you, like most people in the world, giving
your time to the time-gobbling 80 percent of activities that deliver a meager
return? Top performers in nearly any field quickly discover which actions
account for the great majority of results and they weight their time toward
those activities, performing them with great regularity and intensity.
Making time for the things 
that impact your success
Everyone would be making big money in real estate sales if controlling time
and gaining discipline to invest hours in better, higher-value activities were
easy. However, facts prove otherwise. On average, newer agents make less
307
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

than $20,000 a year. These low-income statistics correlate with poor time-
allocation choices.
To allocate larger amounts of time to success-generating actions, follow what
I call The Four Ds:
1. Decide that your time management skills, habits, and activities are
going to change.
This is a challenging first step for most people because changing a behav-
ior, such as time usage, isn’t easy. To avoid change, people search around
for solutions that allow them to keep doing what they’ve always done. In
doing so, they waste yet more time by wavering between the change they
know they must face and the hope that they won’t have to face it.
I believe that the biggest waste of time occurs between the moment
when you know you need to do something and when you actually set out
to do it. That’s why you need to make an immediate commitment to
change your time management patterns and habits.
2. Define what needs to change.
This step involves two phases. First you have to determine the specific
activities that are causing you to waste time or sacrifice productivity.
Then you have to figure out how you can remedy the situation.
For example, say you need to get to your office earlier each day because
you’ll spend less time in traffic and, well, you’re just more motivated and
focused in the morning. To accomplish this goal, you may need to go to
sleep earlier each night and find child care for an extra hour in the morn-
ing. Or maybe you need more prospecting or lead follow-up time. This
may mean that you need to turn off your cell phone to minimize distrac-
tions when you’re trying to undertake these activities.
3. Design a time management plan.
Get proactive rather than reactionary. Typical day planners and PDAs
(personal digital assistants) are reactionary time management tools.
They allow you to schedule time for client needs, appointments, and lim-
ited activities, but they don’t help you take control of time for your own
priorities and purposes. You need to do that part on your own.
To master your time, you need to adopt a time-blocking system that dedi-
cates predetermined periods of time to your most valuable activities. (See
the upcoming section, “Time Blocking Your Way to Success” to discover
time blocking in detail.) The key point is that you can’t leave your days
vulnerable to the time needs of others. You must block out periods of time
for your own most important activities. Otherwise, you risk giving your
days away to the appointment or time requests of clients and colleagues,
leaving you with no time for your own needs. No wonder so many agents
feel burned out and as if they’re being pulled like taffy by others.
308
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

4. Just Do it!
Don’t wait until you’ve analyzed every aspect of every problem and
designed the absolutely perfect solution to take action. Waiting only
results in unrealized income, unfulfilled potential, and limited wealth.
Instead, just do it. Decide what to change, define how to change it, and
design a time management plan that allows for change.
Weighting your time to what matters
No real estate agent will argue with the fact that the activities of prospecting,
lead follow-up, listing presentations, buyer interview presentations, showing
property, and writing and negotiating contracts account for the greatest
results in real estate sales. I call these tasks your direct income-producing
activities, or DIPA.
Following is the list of the half-dozen important activities that I share with all
of my real estate coaching clients:
 Prospecting
 Lead follow-up
 Listing presentations
 Buyer interview presentations
 Showing property to qualified buyers
 Writing and negotiating contracts
309
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time
Early to bed, early to rise. . .
I worked with a client a few years ago who had
difficulty getting into the office early enough to
begin his day. We tracked his difficulty back to
the fact that he was going to bed too late to be
able to reach his office consistently by 8 a.m.,
which is when he needed to start his day.
We further determined that he needed a set
amount of time in the evening to have dinner
with his family, play with his children, and have
time with his wife before their bedtime. He
needed to be home from work by a certain hour
for all of this to happen efficiently and consis-
tently for him.
Once he made the necessary changes, by
coming in earlier and leaving the office on time,
his income shot up dramatically. His quality of
life with his children and wife skyrocketed as
well, all the result of defining the problem,
designing a solution, and managing time
accordingly.

If you dedicate yourself to the above six activities, you’ll see high returns on
your time investment. I’ve studied the time allocation of agents for more than
15 years. I know for certain that on average real estate agents spend fewer
than two hours a day engaged in the activities on this list. Instead, they work
long hours, often putting in more than ten hours a day, and spend 80 percent
or more of their time on activities that generate less than 20 percent of their
revenue. Flip the principle to your advantage. Begin spending more and more
of your time on the activities that are proven to deliver results, and refuse to
be crushed by the weight and waste of those that don’t. (Low production
activities are basically anything that is administration based. Mailing, stamp-
ing, filing, writing ads, creating flyers, and even processing transactions to
close all are activities that are low-production and don’t directly produce rev-
enue. At best, they support the production that has already been done.)
I have no doubt (and neither will any other agent) that if you invest more
time in DIPA activities you’ll dramatically increase your income and probabil-
ity of success.
Invest the bulk of your time in direct income-producing activities. Committing
your time to tasks that deliver results is the easiest, quickest, and most prof-
itable way to earn big bucks in real estate sales.
Focusing on income-producing activities
In order to achieve success, any newer agent must commit a minimum of 15
hours a week to DIPA. That means you need to dedicate 15 hours every single
310
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 
Time management can earn you money
I have a coaching client in Eugene, Oregon, who
doesn’t have a big team of buyers’ agents or
administrative staff. In fact, she works on her
own with one administrative assistant. However,
through her small-scale operation she achieves
higher production growth, income, sales
volume, quality of life, and net profit than prob-
ably any agent in North America.
In 2004, she increased her income by 119 per-
cent, and then experienced another 42 percent
increase in 2005 — or an average annual
income increase of 80 percent over the two
years. Her success story goes well beyond
income figures. Other agents have had similarly
large production increases, but the difference
with my coaching client is that she works an
average of 42 hours a week. She never works
weekends, takes at least one three-day week-
end a month, and takes more than four weeks
of vacation a year.
Her secret? She spends 80 percent of her time
in DIPA activities. I know because she tracks
and shares her time allocation with me. Her time
management is the number one reason for her
income, quality of life, and wealth. She’s a living,
breathing testament to the statement, “It’s not
how many hours you work but what you do in
the hours you work.”

week — three hours every day — to prospecting and lead follow-up. If you do
that, you assure your success and income. Fail to do so and your success will
be in question.
Don’t cheat by trying to replace DIPA tasks with what I call IIPA tasks, or indi-
rect income-producing activities. IIPA tasks include things like making client-
development marketing pieces, producing direct mailings, creating or fiddling
with your Web site, optimizing your search engine placement, publishing
hardcopy or e-mail newsletters, and a near-endless list of other efforts that
agents invest in to indirectly produce income.
The problem is that IIPA activities are difficult to control in terms of the time,
effort, energy, and dollars they require, and they’re almost impossible to mea-
sure in terms of outcome. Often, countless hours result in pieces that go
straight to the trash bin or are deleted with a single keystroke.
Indirect marketing efforts result in a high quantity of contacts. Direct market-
ing efforts result in high-quality contacts — and sales success is the result of
quality rather than quantity.
Aim to spread your time between DIPA and IIPA tasks on at least a four-to-
one ratio: For every hour you spend in IIPA, spend at least four hours in DIPA.
Veer from that ratio and you’ll risk dramatic income swings instead of achiev-
ing consistent revenue growth.
Addressing the challenges of completing production-support activities
Agents spend an undue amount of time on production-supporting activities, or
PSA. These activities include all the steps necessary to support such direct
income-producing activities as prospecting, lead follow-up, taking listings,
and making sales. You can’t avoid the administrative functions that support
your sales and customer service efforts, but you can and should handle them
in the fewest number of hours possible. Here’s how:
 Handle PSA tasks in dedicated blocks of time so they don’t eat away at
your whole day. Errands, MLS searches, MLS input, home flyer creation,
filing, copying, faxing, meeting home inspectors or appraisers, getting
feedback from showings, and purchasing supplies are only a sampling of
the necessary tasks that support your production efforts. Keep a list of
PSA tasks that need to be done and block time to do all of them at once
rather than periodically throughout the day. This will cut back on the
constant number of interruptions that slow down your workday.
 Realize that PSA tasks produce little new revenue, so don’t let them take
over your day or you’ll never get to income-producing efforts. I know of
agents who take a whole day or even a whole week of time to work on the
tasks that support their deal. Yes, deal, as in one! This is a superb example
of procrastination. Get your support work done quickly so you can invest
the bulk of your time to finding and working on the next deal.

Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

The power of the 11 a.m. rule
The 11 a.m. rule goes like this: The world around a real estate agent gears up
at 11:00 each morning. The attorneys, title officers, loan officers, other agents,
appraisers, home inspectors, repair contractors, and clients will most likely
call you after or close to 11 a.m. Because of this, you need to come into the
office early and complete your prospecting and lead follow-up before the
clock strikes that hour.
I even suggest the extreme approach of not answering your phone until 11
a.m. in order to minimize the chance of being distracted during your most
important production hours.
Dealing with time-consuming fires
Time-consuming fires are the hot issues that result from the emotional tur-
moil involved in many real estate transactions. Sometimes they require you
to stay calm and cautious; other times you need to put on a firefighter’s hat
and start dousing the flames of a delayed closing, an emotionally frustrated
buyer or seller, a problem co-op agent, or a slow moving inspector, appraiser,
or loan officer. Let the following rules guide your responses:
 Rule #1: Closing issues can always wait an hour. When your transac-
tion hits a snag, don’t let it dramatically change your day’s schedule.
Wait to resolve the issues during the time you’ve blocked for administra-
tive tasks.
 Rule #2: A frenzied reaction only adds fuel to the fire. More often than
not, when one closing party gets riled it’s because someone else in the
transaction is riled — and hysteria is catchy. Aim to serve as the calming
influence in the transaction. If the problem arises two hours before your
predetermined administrative time slot, calmly inform the parties that
you have prescheduled appointments that you can’t change, but that
you’ll be able to take action when you get out of the appointments in
two hours.
 Rule #3: Fires often burn themselves out. Rather than jump into the
mess, give the issue a bit of time to simmer down. Remember that your
prospecting and lead follow-up tasks are appointments to which you’ve
committed. Sticking to your daily plan may give the issue time to cool or
even resolve itself.
 Rule #4: Don’t wait for a three-alarm fire to call for the pump truck. If
the fire becomes too hot to handle, suit up your broker right away.
Before the transaction flares out of control, ask for help. The longer you
delay, the more effort you’ll spend getting the situation cooled down.

Time Blocking Your Way to Success
A time-blocked schedule reserves and protects slotted time segments for 
preplanned and predetermined activities. The objective of time blocking is 
to increase the amount of time you can invest in direct income-producing
activities.
In more than 20 years as a business owner, I’ve yet to run across a more reli-
able method for seizing control of time and boosting productivity than time
blocking.
Many people have heard of time blocking, but few master its use. The chal-
lenge isn’t in creating the schedule; that’s the easy part. The challenge is
staying on schedule. This is the difficult part because most people set their
time-blocking expectations very high, reserve large portions of time, and
then can’t maintain the schedule.
Setting your schedule in time blocks
Efficient time blocking starts with a schedule grid. See Figures 16-1 and 16-2
for a blank grid and sample to follow. In the beginning, create a grid that
breaks your schedule down into 30-minute segments. As your skill pro-
gresses, you may shift to a 15-minute grid format.
As you complete the grid, I strongly suggest that you block your entire daily
schedule, including personal time, not just your workday. Follow these steps:
1. Block time for your personal life first.
If you don’t, you’ll be hard pressed to squeeze in personal time after
scheduling everything else. Decide what the most important personal
activities in your life are and block them out before you allow any other
obligations onto your calendar. Set aside a date night with your spouse
or partner. Block time for working out, quiet time, prayer time, personal
development time, and family time. If your daughter has soccer games
on Tuesday and Thursday evenings, put those in your schedule. If some-
one wants to see you during those times, tell them you’re booked with
previous appointments.
For my personal schedule, I reserve a weekly date night with my wife,
Joan. I block workout times and set 30 minutes daily of floor time — time
to play on the floor with my four-year-old son, Wesley. I set aside Friday
mornings for breakfast with my family.
2. Decide which full day you will take off each week.

Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

No ifs, ands, or buts. You must take at least one day off. The reaction of
new agents is, “Oh! I couldn’t do that.” Give me a break. God even took
the seventh day off.
A few words on the definition of a day off: It means no real estate calls,
no answering your cell phone, no negotiating offers, no taking ad calls,
no taking sign calls, and no meeting with clients or prospects. The
minute you do any business activity, it’s a workday, even if you only
work for five minutes. Honor yourself and your family with one day a
week away from real estate. The 24/7 weekly approach to the real estate
business leads to family frustrations and burn out. Try receiving the love
you need from a pile of money.
3. Decide which evenings you will and will not work. Again, set bound-
aries. I suggest that you make no more than three or four nights a week
available to clients. Designate them during the time-blocking stage and
then move prospects only into those evening time slots. I limited my
own evening work to Tuesdays only. Every other night of the week my
wife could expect me home for dinner no later than 6:30 p.m. if I had a
5:15 p.m. listing appointment.
4. Begin blocking time for direct income-producing activities.
• Block time for prospecting and lead follow-up first and preferably
early in the day. I know what you’re thinking, “Aren’t more people
home in the afternoon and evening?” Yes, probably so. But will you
prospect consistently when you have to do it in the evening? After
nearly two decades in real estate, I know for a fact that the answer
is no. The fact that more people are home at night doesn’t matter if
that’s not when you’re picking up the phone to call them. Schedule
calls for morning hours when you can and will actually make the
contacts. (See Chapter 5 for more prospecting tips.)
• Schedule time slots for appointments next. Determine how many
appointments you need to hold and how long they need to run. For
example, how long do you need for a listing presentation? How
much time do you need to show a buyer homes in a specific area?
I scheduled appointment slots in one-hour increments, which
worked because after my second year in the business I didn’t work
with buyers. When you work with buyers, you need to plan on
longer-lasting appointments. With sellers, I figured that my typical
listing presentation lasted about 30 to 45 minutes. The hour block
gave me at least 15 minutes of drive time to reach my next appoint-
ment. I scheduled appointments in the afternoons at 3:15, 4:15, and
5:15, Monday through Thursday. Tuesdays I worked late, and I
scheduled appointments at 6:15, 7:15, and 8:15. Whenever I didn’t
have a 5:15 appointment, I transferred that block to prospecting
time so that I could catch up with people after work.
316
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Once you block appointment slots, you know exactly when to ask
people to meet with you. You can imitate a doctor’s nurse or den-
tist’s receptionist, saying, “I have an opening at 5:15 p.m. on Tuesday
or 4:15 p.m. on Wednesday. Which would be better for you?”
5. Schedule time for administrative tasks.
Make a list of your regular, necessary activities, such as phone calls,
office meetings, and company tours, and put them into your time
blocked schedule.
6. Finally, block some flextime.
Flextime helps you to stay on track. It allows you to put out fires, make
emergency calls, handle unscheduled but necessary tasks, and still stay
on your schedule.
As you start out, block about thirty minutes of flextime for every two
hours of scheduled time in your daily grid. You can always reduce or
remove the flextime blocks as your skills and discipline increase. Most
agents who are new to time blocking create schedules that are too rigid.
The lack of flexibility causes them to be off their schedules before 10:30
in the morning. When they get off schedule early, they’re then off sched-
ule for the rest of the day.
Time-blocking mistakes to block out
Sales professionals in the top 10 percent of their industries share a common
trait: They control, use, and invest their time more wisely and effectively than
their lower-performing associates. Among sales professionals, time usage
determines income.
The most significant challenge for most sales professionals is time control.
Through years of study and coaching sales professionals, I’ve compiled the
following list of challenges that most sales people experience when trying to
master their time-block schedule.
Making yourself too available
The biggest error that sales people make is getting sucked into the interrup-
tion game. You need times in your schedule that are free of interruptions,
during which you bar access to all but those to whom you grant exceptions.
Follow this advice:
 Use an effective gatekeeper to screen your calls. Have the gatekeeper
redirect all minor issues, problems, challenges, and interruptions that
can be handled by an assistant or some other person.
 Limit the number of people who have unfiltered access to you. Create
a short list of the few important people who can interrupt your schedule
317
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

at any time of the day, and don’t let anyone else in during time blocked for
interruption-free activities. My short list includes my wife, my father, my
attorney, and a few key associates. Period. As you make your own list,
include only those who are extremely important to your personal life. Very
few clients find their way onto the short lists of truly successful people.
Choosing the wrong office location and setup
The nature of your physical office has a dramatic effect on your time manage-
ment and productivity. Give serious consideration to the following two issues:
 See that the size of your work environment matches the size of your
practice. If you don’t have enough square footage for yourself and your
staff, your production will be stunted.
I had a coaching client a few years back who worked out of 150 square
feet of office space with three associates. Amazingly, even as they were
tripping over each other, they managed to do 150 transactions a year.
However, when they moved into a new 500 square-foot office, they
watched their production soar. Each team member could control time
better, limit interruptions, access files, and hold meetings. The expanded
space allowed for an increase in discipline, talent, skill, and production.
Don’t let your physical space limit your growth opportunities. If you’re
crowded by your staff, you’re in the wrong physical location.
 Your personal office must be private. Top-producing agents need to do
too many focused activities in a day to be in the bullpen of activity. If
you’re surrounded by the buzz of staff members, inbound phone calls,
problems, and challenges, it’s easy to be tempted to jump in and help,
tackling the service issues at the expense of new business creation. The
only way to control your planning and prospecting environment is to
house your practice in a private office away from distractions and staff.
Failing to operate on an appointment-only basis
Too many agents are willing to meet at all hours of the day and night and on a
moment’s notice. By time blocking, you can create appointment slots and drive
prospects into those slots, just as your doctor, dentist, or attorney does.
Studies show that 80 percent of all prospects are willing to fit into the schedules
of their professional advisors. But when prospects aren’t alerted to an advisor’s
schedule, they take control on their own, dictating the appointment time and
leaving an agent like you juggling your schedule to adapt to their needs. Real
estate agents accept this knee-jerk scheduling approach as a necessary aspect
of a service-oriented business — as if total availability equals service.
Operate as a professional on an appointment-only basis. Schedule all appoint-
ments during time-blocked periods when you know you’ll be available,
focused, and uninterrupted by any issue other than the one your client is
sharing.
318
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Bowing to distractions
Real estate sales is among the most interrupted and distracted professions
on the face of the planet. Agents are distracted by the constant jangle of desk
phones, home phones, and cell phones.
If the phone isn’t ringing, you have the distraction of e-mail, which usually inter-
rupts you with some unsolicited miracle offer or, less often, with a new lead
opportunity. Here’s a tip: Don’t derail your day just because your computer tells
you that you’ve got mail. The conversion ratio of Internet leads is less than 1
percent. If you’re engaged in productive activities, don’t stop what you’re doing
for a 1 percent opportunity. Control distractions following this advice:
 Block time in your day for the distractions you know you’ll encounter.
If you want to socialize with other agents, plan a set time to do that. Just
remember to keep the coffee klatch short and within the time you allot-
ted for it.
 Create a list of no more than five people that are granted instant
access during your workday. Have your assistant memorize the names.
If you don’t have an assistant, work with your receptionist so that only
those few people are granted unfiltered access.
Killing the Time Killer 
Called Procrastination
The number one obstacle between real estate agents and higher production
is interruptions. A close second is procrastination.
Procrastination is the direct result of a lack of urgency to do what needs to be
done and to do it now. Urgency is directly linked to success. You can increase
your output by about 30 percent if you work with urgency in mind.
My friend Brian Tracy shared with me years ago the law of forced efficiency.
This law is based on the premise that you never have enough time to do
everything you want or need to do, but that in every day you can always find
enough time to accomplish the most important tasks. Obviously, you won’t
get to the most important tasks if you’re bogged down with tasks of low
importance (which could easily wait until later). Nor will you get to the most
important tasks if you procrastinate.
Once you set your priorities, take action without procrastination by following
these two pieces of advice:
319
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

 Limit the time in which you can get the job done. Too much time to
complete work can lower urgency and lead to procrastination. By identi-
fying days off and time off, you raise the efficiency and effectiveness of
your production on the days you’re working.
 Give yourself deadlines. Have you ever noticed how much gets done
when you’re leaving on a vacation in a day or so. I’ve seen people double
or triple their work output in the days leading up to a vacation. What if
you operated every day at that pace and urgency? By setting deadlines
that encourage urgency, your income and quality of life would explode
to heights you never imagined.
Moving forward with a clear vision
A good deal of procrastination results directly from a lack of clear vision or
clarity about what to do. If you don’t know what you want, you can’t possibly
achieve it. You won’t likely hit a target that you can’t see.
Clarity of purpose kills procrastination, yet fewer than 3 percent of all people
define and write down their life goals.
If you haven’t written down your own life goals, answer these questions:
 What do you want to be?
 What do you want to do with your life?
 What do you want to have?
 Where do you want to go?
I know you want to be financially independent. Otherwise, you wouldn’t be in
real estate sales. But what does financial independence mean to you? How
much money do you need to live the lifestyle you dream about? The famous
success motivator Napoleon Hill expresses the importance of identifying
your goal when he says: “There is one quality that one must posses to win,
and that is definiteness of purpose . . . the knowledge of what one wants and
a burning desire to achieve it.”
Clarify your desires in life. Once you’re certain about what you want to
achieve, you’ll find it far easier to set and follow an action plan that isn’t 
hindered by procrastination.
Knowing your objectives
You’ll set annual goals, of course. But also view each day that you work or
play in terms of daily objectives. What do you want to accomplish today?
What big-picture results do you want to achieve by day’s end?
320
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

I coached a young real estate agent, in Portland, Oregon. He had a high sense
of urgency to succeed but struggled with establishing the plans and objectives
necessary to achieve his goals. In 1998 he wanted to make $250,000 in income.
He was less than a third of the way to his goal when we began working together
in July of that year. Then, over the next five months he closed deals for another
$175,000! The key was setting a daily objective. Each morning he asked and
answered the question: Who has the highest probability of buying or selling
today? Then he focused single-mindedly on those prospects.
Setting your priorities
Your priorities are the most important actions or steps you must take in
order to achieve your objectives for the day. Objectives and priorities aren’t
one and the same. Objectives are results you intend to achieve and priorities
are steps you must take to achieve success.
By prioritizing the importance or value of the tasks on your to-do list, you
greatly increase the probability that you’ll be motivated to overcome pro-
crastination and get the job done.
Most people go about creating task lists in the wrong way. They write down
all of the things that they must do each day and then go to work, proudly
ticking off items as they’re completed. These people equate their level of suc-
cess with the number of items they check off their list. Success, however,
doesn’t result from how many things you get done. It results from getting the
right things done. In other words, you need to know your priorities.
Following is an outline for the prioritization system I’ve used with success for
years:
1. Create your daily task list as you normally would.
Don’t think at all about what is most important. Just think about what
needs to get done over the course of the day. Put yourself in brainstorm-
ing mode and get your thoughts down on paper.
2. Once you have your list, create task categories.
You’re not prioritizing during this step. This isn’t about what to do 
first, second, or third. All you’re doing here is sorting tasks into these
categories:
A. You’ll suffer a significant consequence if you don’t complete these
tasks today. Even if you have to work all day and all night, these
items must get done.
B. These tasks trigger a mild consequence if they aren’t completed
today. You probably wouldn’t stay late in order to finish them.
C. These tasks have no penalty at all if they aren’t done today.
321
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

D. These tasks can be delegated. They involve low-value activities
that could be performed by someone who has a lower hourly
dollar value than you.
E. These tasks can and should be eliminated. They probably made
their way onto your list out of tradition or habit. They aren’t neces-
sary, so you need to figure out how to get them off the list. I call it
pruning.
My friend Zig Ziglar tells a story of a little boy who asks his mother
as they’re preparing a holiday meal why she cuts the ends of the
ham. She says, “I don’t know. My mother always did it this way.”
Now this four-year-old boy said, “Let’s call Grandma right now and
find out why.” So they call Grandma and ask why she always cut
the ends off the ham. Her reply: Her roaster was too small!
3. Once your list is categorized, prioritize the tasks.
Begin with your A category and determine which item deserves A-1
status. Follow by designating A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5, and so on. Then repeat
the process for the B, C, and D categories. Go to work in the order of
these priorities and you’ll be amazed at how much you can accomplish
in less time than ever and without falling into the procrastination trap.
As you master the art of prioritizing, expect to see fewer cross-offs or check-
marks on your task list because you’ll complete fewer activities. However,
they’ll be the more important activities — and quality comes before quantity
in this case.
Every day that you achieve closure on all your A-category items, consider
yourself a terrific success. If you complete your A items every single day this
year, I guarantee that you’ll see your production and income explode.
Giving yourself deadlines and rewards
Human instinct makes us move away from pain and toward the pleasures of
life. That’s why you have to link deadlines with rewards if you want to keep
yourself motivated to complete your work in a consistent way. Without a
reward, it’s darned difficult to face the rigor of a complex task.
Each day when you set your objectives and priorities, set deadlines as well.
Then link completion of your tasks with a clearly defined reward.
For example, set a deadline to get all your prospecting and lead follow-up
calls done by 10:30 a.m., and then reward yourself with a trip to your favorite
coffee shop or lunch restaurant. Beyond daily rewards, promise yourself that
if you meet your deadlines and complete all your priorities for a full week,
you’ll reward yourself with a massage, facial, or special evening out.
322
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

Realize these two truths about rewards:
 You have to give them to yourself. Don’t expect to receive them from
your broker, clients, prospects, staff, or even family.
323
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time
What’s an hour of your time worth, anyway?
Your hourly rate, or hourly value, is one of the
most important numbers in your life, yet only
one out of a hundred real estate agents can say
what their time is worth. Ask members of a real
estate agency’s administrative staff and you get
the answer down to a penny. They know exactly
what they’re paid on an hourly basis. Your
broker manager, who’s on salary, can answer
the question as well. And certainly most people
in the world around you, including your clients,
can tell you what an hour of their time is worth.
It’s time that you get with the program!
Most respected professionals, including doctors,
dentists, accountants, or attorneys, fundamen-
tally sell time for a price. The higher their profes-
sional skills and the greater their reputations and
success levels, the more they’re able to increase
their hourly rates in order to earn even more
income. A successful attorney can decide to
charge $300 an hour instead of $225. A dentist
can decide that a gold crown will cost a patient
$1,200 instead of the former $900 price tag.
Unfortunately, as an agent, you can’t simply
decide to start charging, say, an 11 percent
commission rate rather than the rate that is con-
sidered normal in your marketplace. But you
can raise your income and the value of each
hour invested in your business by increasing
your productivity.
To calculate your hourly value, follow these 
formulas:
Hours worked per day × days worked per
week × weeks worked per year = total
hours worked
Gross commission income ÷ total hours
worked = hourly rate
Calculate the gross commission income
you earn in a year by either asking your
broker or adding all the transactions and
multiplying it by your commission rate. If
you’re a new agent, use your income goal
instead of your actual gross income.
If you’re a full-time real estate agent, you prob-
ably work somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000
hours. If the number is closer to 4,000, then I’m
safe to wager that your hourly rate is very low.
I’ve met with agents who make $400,000 a year
by basically working round-the-clock, but it
turns out that their hourly value barely reaches
$100 an hour. Other agents limit their work hours
and maximize productivity, earning hourly rates
well over $1,000 an hour — that’s better than a
surgeon’s rate!
To raise your hourly rate, raise the productivity
of each hour you invest in your business.
Watch your hourly value as a key indicator of
your business success. Use your current hourly
rate as a current benchmark, and then set a
goal to double, triple, even quadruple the value
you wring out of each hour.

 You have to set interim goals to keep yourself moving forward on a
consistent basis. If your reward for yourself is financial independence,
your payoff may not arrive for 10 or 20 years. That’s way too long to wait
for a pat on the back.
Sales involves high pay, for sure, but also a fair amount of rejection and dis-
couragement in between. Rewards encourage you to do the things you know
you should do even when you don’t feel like doing them.
Carpe Diem: Seize Your Day
One of the most identifiable characteristics of high performers is that they’re
action-oriented. They don’t wait around to see what will happen or how
things will turn out. They seize each day, wringing all the possibilities, perfor-
mance, and profit possible out of every encounter. They treat each moment
as a gift. As the saying goes, “That’s why we call today the present!”
Stop wasting time
To quote Napoleon Hill again: “Do not wait; the time will never be ‘just right.’
Start where you stand and work with whatever tools you may have at your
command, and better tools will be found as you go along.” In other words:
Get to work!
If you’re a newer agent, don’t waste time fretting over the fact that your skills
or tools aren’t at the level of other agents. Work with what you have and know
that your abilities will improve with use. At the worst, you’ll make a mistake
from which you’ll learn a good lesson. Finding out early in your career what
not to do delivers value that will pay off again and again in your future.
Stop letting others waste your time
Too many consumers feel no loyalty or obligation to agents. They have the
idea that agents are well paid through commissions, but they don’t seem to
acknowledge that we’re not paid at all if no sale occurs. For that reason, you
should only work with clients who are serious about buying or selling and
who agree to work exclusively with you to accomplish their real estate objec-
tives. Otherwise, you’re letting real estate shoppers waste your time.
324
Part IV: Running a Successful Real Estate Business 

The biggest loss that most agents experience is lost opportunity. Each time
you invest in helping a prospect who fails to take action or, worse yet, leaves
you for another agent, your investment results in absolutely no financial com-
pensation. That’s like a personal injury attorney losing all his cases — he’d
surely be out of business if he didn’t ever win.
Manage constant interruptions
The best way to handle interruptions is to stop them from happening in the
first place.
Turn off your cell phone when you’re conducting direct income-producing
activities — for example, prospecting or lead follow-up. Tell the receptionist
to hold your calls and take messages instead. Turn off your e-mail program so
the “you’ve got mail” icon doesn’t pop onto your computer screen. Sign out
of your online instant message program. Hang a sign on your office door
advising that you’re not to be interrupted.
Follow the same rules when you’re with a client. Nothing is more impolite than
an agent who handles phone calls while driving around showing clients prop-
erty. At the very least, set your cell phone to vibrate rather than ring when
you’re in buyer interviews, showing property, or on listing appointments.
Eliminate distractions for your own good and for the good of the relationship
with the client you’re serving.
Keep phone calls short
When you’re making or taking transaction-servicing calls or production-
support calls, you need to conduct business in the shortest amount of time
possible. Otherwise you’ll erode the time you need for high-value income-
producing activities. To keep calls short, employ these techniques:
 Establish an indication of the time available as you begin the call. For
example, say something like, “I have an appointment in 15 minutes but
your call was an important one and I wanted to get back to you as
quickly as I could.” This technique alerts the call recipient to your time
limitation and says, nicely, “Get to the point quickly.” The technique
shows that you value the caller and made a special effort to make time
for the conversation.
If you’re on a time-blocked schedule everything is treated as an appoint-
ment, including times for returning phone calls, so you’ll be speaking the
truth. You do have another appointment in 15 minutes. This technique is
particularly appropriate for prospect or client calls.
325
Chapter 16: Maximizing Your Time

 Offer an alternative to a short phone call. If you think your client or
prospect wants or needs more than a short return phone call, follow the
above technique but then go one step further: Assure the other person
that 15 minutes should be more than enough time but, if it’s not, you can
schedule a phone conference when you’ll be available for an appoint-
ment later in the day. I’ve made this offer many times, and I’ve never had
to talk with the client later. We’ve always managed to resolve the issues
during the short conversation.
 When possible, handle production-support calls with voice-mail mes-
sages. Since you want to establish personal relationships that lead to
face-to-face meetings, you don’t want to rely on voice mail with prospects.
But when you’re handling service calls, voice mail is a time-effective
option for both you and the other party. Make a call, leave a message,
and offer the option to call you back (with the assurance that if your
message resolves the issue there is no need for a return call). Follow a
script such as this one:
“Bob, I know that you’re busy. I believe that this resolves the issue. If you
agree, there’s no need for you to call me back. If you do need to speak with
me, I’ll be available later today between 3:30 and 4:15. Please call me then.”
Use your car to gain efficiency 
and career advancement
One of the greatest assets in my early career was my car. It wasn’t because I had
such a glamorous vehicle. It’s because I turned it into my skills-development
classroom. I never turned on the engine without playing something that would
teach me something (except when I had clients with me, of course).
I’m a firm believer in the auto-university. You have a large learning curve
ahead and plenty of drive time during which you can “go to school” with CDs,
CD series, and now podcasts that help you improve your business, sales, and
personal skills.
In contrast, listening to the radio is a waste of time. It teaches you nothing
about how to improve or change your thinking, talents, bank account, and
life. Use your drive time as learning time, instead. You’re success-oriented or
you wouldn’t have bought this book. Keep acquiring new ideas by turning
your commute into skills-development time, and get ready to watch your
career take off.

Real Estate Agent

 Dressing for success
 Investing in a quality telephone headset
T
here are certain tools that I believe that every agent must acquire to help
them be more effective in their business. These can be accumulated over
time but the best approach is to get them now.
A Good Contact Management System
As a salesperson, you have to be able to keep in touch with prospects and
clients easily and effectively. You need to be able to find names, addresses,
phone numbers, and e-mail addresses in an instant.
You can track your contacts the old-fashioned way (on notecards), but you’ll
outgrow that quickly. My advice is to invest in a CRM (short for customer rela-
tionship management) software package. Many of the software packages avail-
able, such as ACT!, GoldMine, SharkWare, and www.Salespeople.com, are
specifically designed for salespeople. The purpose of a good CRM is to coor-
dinate your leads and lead-management activities. An agent with a CRM can
send e-mail, mail merge letters, and make phone calls with the touch of a few
keys. They are able to track and follow-up on leads without having to remem-
ber to do it. The CRM does the work of reminding them and generating the
contact with the prospect.

Another option is to buy a software package that is specific to the real estate
industry. These programs that are specific to real estate agents hold many
advantages over the general sales programs. They’re usually programmed
with form letters and other sample correspondence that an agent may need
to use. They also have sample lead follow-up and client follow-up plans already
built in. Most have plans you can apply when marketing a property. They also
have plans you can launch once you’ve secured a buyer for your listing.
I recommend TOP PRODUCER or Online Agent. Both programs are real estate
agent specific, and with TOP PRODUCER, you can choose to pay a small
monthly fee (per user) for an Internet-access only version. This saves you all
the upfront costs of the software, and you get the updates for free. You can
also access your database from anywhere in the world as long as you have a
high-speed Internet connection.
A Real Estate Calculator
An agent must have the ability to help her client figure out the approximate
mortgage payment, net proceeds after the sale, and down payment amount
needed based on loan to value ratios.
Most importantly, an agent needs to be able to figure out her commission
amount. When selecting a calculator, select one that has the features you
want. I suggest features like payment calculation functions and ammortiza-
tion functions. Also, ensure that you can easily figure out how to use it. Some
have so many different (and unnecessary) functions and keys that figuring it
out can take forever.
Professional Attire
Each real estate area or region has a set level of professional dress. Your first
impression to a prospect can carry a lot of weight. If you’re dressed well,
they’ll assume you’re successful, even if you aren’t. The public will make a
judgment of you and your services, fairly or unfairly, based on how you dress.
In most markets except resort or tropical markets, I think that a suit (a 
professional-looking dress would also work for female agents) is the correct
attire for a professional real estate agent. I rarely went to work without putting
on a suit. You feel better and more powerful when you’re dressed well. When
buying clothes, start off by buying classics that will never go out of style. Stay
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

away from the ultra-trendy colors and styles. By investing in classics, you can
mix and match and stretch your wardrobe. 
I also recommend having your shirts (or blouses) professionally laundered.
There’s nothing as crisp, clean, and professional as a well-starched shirt. It
reeks of success.
Personal Web Site
With more than 85 percent of buyers using the Internet to search for proper-
ties, your Web site has become an essential tool for lead generation and for
exposing your sellers’ homes.
You don’t need the fanciest, most expensive Web site in cyberspace. Just
search out one of the many companies that make solid-template, mass-
produced Web sites. These types of sites are extremely economical in the 
initial investment you have to make, as well as in monthly hosting fees. 
Many of these companies build cost-effective sites so they can get the 
residual income they charge monthly from hosting your site.
You want to work with a company that builds template sites as well as custom
sites. You will want a template Web site as a new agent. This will save you a lot
of money on the start up costs of a Web site. As you progress in your career,
you will want a custom–designed site. By selecting a company that is skilled at
both, you save time when searching for someone to build your next site. 
You also want a company that has the ability to place you higher in the
search engine rankings. This is where you’ll generate traffic and leads. I
encourage you to check out www.ChampionRealtorWebsites.com. They
build template and custom sites and have a program that generates high
search-engine placement.
Professional Business 
Cards and Stationery
The proper business cards and stationery are essential tools for a successful
agent. Opt for business cards with your picture on them to help your
prospects create a quicker connection and recognition.
331
Chapter 17: Ten Must-Haves for a Successful Real Estate Agent

Make sure the photo’s current. I have had too many agents hand me business
cards that caused me to look three times at the card and back at the person
to detect any kind of resemblance. Too often, our old pictures look like we
just left the high school prom.
Also, having notecards, letterhead, and envelopes that identify you is advis-
able. You need to ensure that the professional image you work so hard to
achieve is carried through with every contact and correspondence you have
with your clients and prospects.
A Clean, Professional, Reliable Car
If you’re a newer agent, you’ll be working with more buyers than sellers in the
early part of your career. By having a professional and reliable car, you can
increase your probability of success.
Ideally, you never want to meet prospects for an appointment at the home
they called or e-mailed you about. You want to meet them at your office. By
meeting at your office, you can suggest that you ride in one car to the home
you’re showing — preferably yours. With the vast increase in gas prices, you
can make this a benefit to them. You’re better able to model the consultative
relationship you want by taking your car.
By meeting them at the office rather than the home you also have protected
yourself from meeting someone at an empty home that you don’t know. A few
times a year we hear stories of people, especially women, who meet people at
homes, and the person meeting them was not a buyer but someone meaning
to do harm to them. It is for your protection that you meet them at the office.
Before taking the prospect out in your car, it’s better to conduct a buyer
interview. It’s easier to draw them into your office for this type of meeting if
you aren’t meeting them at the home. When prospects arrive at your office
and want to go see the home they’re interested in without sitting through a
buyer interview, you’ll at least be able to conduct some of the interview en
route to the home you’ll be showing if they ride in your car.
That is why you need a professional and reliable car. You must also have a
car that is clean both inside and out. You don’t need to drive a BMW,
Mercedes, or Lexus, but you do need a car that demonstrates you’re doing
reasonably well in your business. When you’re a listing agent, you can oper-
ate by other rules. I didn’t have a buyer in my car ever again midway through
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

my third year in the business. The exterior of my car was perfect; the inside,
however, was a trash can with papers, cups, bags, and clothes laying all over.
It didn’t matter, though, because the seller couldn’t see inside my car.
My advice is that if you can’t afford a luxury brand of vehicle that is new or
fairly new, buy one that is older with low mileage. Make sure it’s a classic in
style and prestige. I drove my original real estate car for more than eight
years, and it still looked good when I sold it.
A Headset for Your Phone
I’m a huge believer in prospecting and, from experience, I’ve discovered that
a headset makes effective prospecting much easier. It allows you to stand
while you’re doing the prospecting, and because your hands are free, you’re
able to engage your body in the communication. A headset will improve your
posture, position, energy, and enthusiasm.
Another perk of a headset is that it will leave both of your hands free so you
can type notes directly into your contact manager while you’re talking with
the prospect or client. It’s the only way to do it.
Don’t go the cheap route. You can get cheap headsets for $50, but they also
sound like cheap headsets. Make the investment of a couple hundred dollars
and get a good one. I prefer wireless headsets because I’m completely free to
walk around my whole office when talking to someone.
A Number-Based Business Plan
Too few salespeople follow business plans that encompass the sales ratios
and numbers of the real estate business. They don’t know, or take the time to
calculate, the number of contacts needed to generate a lead, the number of
leads needed to generate an appointment, the number of appointments
needed to create a committed client, or the number of committed clients
needed to generate a commission check. Once you know these numbers and
your average commission check amount, you can calculate how to make any
amount of money you desire to earn.
333
Chapter 17: Ten Must-Haves for a Successful Real Estate Agent

Sales Scripts
Knowing clearly what to say in every situation really separates the high earn-
ers from the low earners in real estate sales. Success leaves clues for anyone
who’s seeking it. Ancient scripture says, “Seek, and you will find.”
My best advice is to find yourself some scripts that are proven to work. Invest
hours weekly practicing them to perfection. A word of caution: Practice doesn’t
make perfect, as the old saying goes. Practice makes permanent. Only perfect
practice makes perfect. To achieve perfect delivery, be sure to have the fol-
lowing: the right attitude, expectations of success, perfect pauses, and 
enough repetition to master each script. If you need scripts, you can go to 
my Web site at www.realestatechampions.com and download some
scripts that we have available for free.
Be sure that your role playing partner is as committed to your success as you
are. My best role playing partner was my wife, Joan. I know there were times
when, on the inside, she was thinking “not again,” but she never showed it.
Support System
This isn’t a tool in the classic sense of the word, but agents can use it as their
most effective tool. In fact, this is probably one of the most important tools
you’ll come by.
I think you’ll find that with many successful people in life, there is a spouse,
child, friend, parent, or significant partner that contributed mightily to their
success. For example, I would never have had the success that I had in my
real estate sales career had it not been for my wife. Countless days I’d go
home feeling dejected, frustrated, and beaten up. Some days I even felt that I
wanted to quit. She would listen, care, and love me. Then she would encour-
age me to remember that even though today was a bad day, tomorrow would
be better. She told me straight out that she believed in me and knew that I
was going to be successful. To this day, I believe her support role caused my
success to happen.

Ten Tips for Working with Buyers
In This Chapter
 Qualifying prospects and working exclusively with committed clients
 Managing the relationship to achieve a successful outcome
M
ost highly successful agents are listing agents who represent home
sellers. But the majority of all agents — and nearly all newer agents —
earn most of their commissions by serving as buyers’ agents. As you build
your business in the early years, use the following ten tips to increase your
effectiveness and efficiency when working with buyers.
Qualify Your Prospects
Either prospects are motivated and able to buy, or they’re not. Agents work-
ing with low-quality buyer leads and hoping to raise buyers’ interest levels
and convince them to take action, most often are wasting precious time.
An agent can offer counsel on favorable interest rates, low inventory levels,
and the benefits of taking immediate action, but even the most skilled sales-
person can’t prompt an unmotivated prospect to adopt a sense of urgency.
Quality prospects must be motivated to buy, must want or need to take
action within a short time frame, and must be committed to working exclu-
sively with you as their agent. If your prospect lacks these attributes, you’re
better off saying “next” and turning your time and talent toward another
prospect. Turn to Chapter 9 for advice and a questionnaire to use when 
qualifying your prospects.

Work Only with Committed Clients
Many agents think they cover this issue when they ask buyer prospects if
they are working with another agent, but that’s really the wrong question.
The right question is, “Are you committed to another agent?” This gets to the
heart of the philosophy you want your clients to adopt: commitment to work-
ing exclusively with you.
Agents receive compensation from committed clients. Clients who only
“work” with you make no promises regarding the outcome. And the odds are
high that they may switch to another agent at any time, leaving you empty-
handed in the end.
If you’ve advertised a listing and you receive an ad call or sign call, don’t
simply offer to meet and show the home. Make it your objective to meet the
buyer prospects in your office. If you feel that you need to show them one
home to open the door to commitment, do so. However, don’t show addi-
tional properties without testing their motivation to buy, confirming their
commitment to buy, and gaining their loyalty to you as an agent. Loyalty is
best achieved through an “exclusive right to represent” contract with the
buyer. If you as an agent don’t acquire that level of loyalty, you could get
burned by the buyer.
Don’t Assume the Buyer Is Exclusively
Committed to You
If you indulge yourself in the belief that a prospective buyer who comes
through your open house, responds to your ad, calls after seeing your sign,
or hits your Web site is dealing with you and only you, you’re practicing wish-
ful and faulty thinking.
Make it your objective to be the first agent to set an appointment for a face-
to-face meeting with a specific client, and ensure that it ends with the launch
of your exclusive working relationship. Until you gain the buyer’s agreement
to work exclusively with you, you’re in competition with all the other agents
in your marketplace.
336
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Ask For and Win an Appointment
Whether you’re working with buyers or sellers, the route to success starts
with a face-to-face appointment — in your office — during which you can
demonstrate your value to the prospect.
The appointment is your gateway to a new client and, of course, to a closed
deal and a commission check. In every conversation with a qualified prospect,
ask for an appointment. Flip to Chapter 9 for detailed advice on how to handle
the appointment, conduct your presentation, and convincingly set yourself
apart from other agents.
Be Ready to Counter Typical 
Buyer Misconceptions
Buyers, especially first-time buyers who comprise the bulk of a newer agent’s
clientele, often come to the transaction with limited knowledge and a lineup of
misunderstandings about how real estate agents and real estate deals work.
Be ready to confront and overcome the following frequent problem areas:
 Many buyers don’t see why they need to work exclusively with a par-
ticular agent to find and buy a home. Many think that once they find
the home of their dreams the seller’s agent can handle the deal. As they
see it, the seller is already paying the commission and so the buyer can
just piggyback and take advantage of the agent’s time and expertise. It’s
your job to help the buyer understand that by working exclusively with
a buyer’s agent — preferably you — they’ll get the same kind of prefer-
ential treatment and fiduciary counsel that, for example, attorneys
promise when they agree to represent only one client in a legal case.
 Buyers don’t understand the importance of beginning their home
search by being prequalified or, better yet, preapproved for a loan.
Explain to the buyers that just as they want to find the best home, the
sellers want to find the best buyer. If sellers are presented with two
offers, one from a buyer who is clearly in a financial position to close 
the deal and the other who has a bunch of financial question marks,
guess which one they’ll choose.
 Too many buyers have a preconceived idea of their perfect home and
think that if they look long enough — and if they get enough agents
337
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Working with Buyers

searching on their behalf — they’ll find the needle in the haystack.
The reality is this: Buyers don’t buy perfect homes; they turn the houses
they buy into perfect homes. If you’re representing a buyer in search of
ready-made perfection, you either need to help your client forget the
perfection myth or you need to select another buyer to work with.
The list of buyer misconceptions goes on and on. Most buyers think they
should never offer full price. Instead, they think they should always start with
a low offer and come up later. And, maybe worst of all, they’re convinced
they can dally because the owners of the property they want to buy will wait
for them to act. When you encounter buyers with these beliefs, tell them this
truth: The most disappointed buyers are those who lose the home they want
by not taking early action or by not being competitive enough in the offers
they do make.
Explain the Services You Provide
You can’t assume buyers understand what you do. They don’t. Nor do they
know how to distinguish you from all the other agents in your marketplace.
Detail what you do and how you do it better than other agents by following
this advice:
 Provide a complete explanation of the home buying process.
 Provide a complete overview of current and emerging real estate condi-
tions in your market area. If you need help compiling a marketplace
analysis, count on the information in Chapter 4 to help you out.
 Let your clients know that you’re ready and able to assist them in select-
ing the best home in their price range.
 Write your purchase agreement (the contract between the buyer and
seller) to correctly and clearly express your intentions and how you’ll
represent the buyers’ interests.
 Submit your purchase agreement in a manner that presents you in the
most favorable position.
Chapter 9 offers advice to follow for making a quality presentation to win a
listing — and the same advice applies to winning a buyer client.
You must distinguish yourself from the competition. You need to prove your
excellence and convince your prospects that you offer important personal
services that they can only receive by choosing you to exclusively represent
their interests in the purchase of their new home.
338
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Develop a Partnership with a Lender
One of the best ways to win commitment from buyer prospects is to bring a
mortgage originator into the relationship early on. This partnership delivers
two major advantages:
 The lender can determine the prospect’s financial qualifications, which
spares you from spending hours with prospects that are financially
unable to buy or unable to buy at the level they desire.
 By steering your prospect toward a trusted lender, you put the financial
portion of the transaction into the hands of a skilled professional. Just
as the number of real estate agents has exploded over the past five years,
so have the ranks of the mortgage industry. If you leave the choice of a
lender to chance, odds are better than good that the deal will go to a
lender you don’t know or recommend, leaving you working harder to
pick up the pieces at the end of the transaction.
Ask Buyer Prospects Plenty of Questions
Contrary to popular belief, prospects don’t want to listen to your sales spiel.
They want to talk about their wants, needs, and desires and your benefits.
Arm yourself with a good list of questions, and you’ll be well on your way to
not only gathering the information you need to do your job well, but also to
establishing the rapport and confidence necessary to gain the prospect’s
commitment.
To gather the information you need, discover everything you can about what
the buyers are looking for in a new home. What area or areas do they prefer?
What type of home do they have in mind? What home styles do they like
best? What is their ideal move date? How many bedrooms, bathrooms, and
other types of rooms do they want? How long have they been looking? Have
they seen anything they’ve liked? What are their financing arrangements and
how far along are they in securing the financing? How do they want to be
communicated with? What is their expectation of you as an agent?
Take Control
When you work with seller prospects, either you get a listing contract or you
don’t. Right then and there, you know whether you have a committed client,
339
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Working with Buyers

and you know exactly what the sellers expect to get out of the deal, because
the sales price is right on the agreement.
Buyer prospects are harder to pin down. They may be inclined to work with a
number of agents. They may change their minds about what they really want.
They may have lofty and unrealistic home expectations. For these reasons
and more, as a buyers’ agent you need to take control and manage the agent-
buyer relationship.
The first step is to convince the buyers of the value of working exclusively
with one agent. The next step is to find out the buyers’ purchase and service
expectations by asking the kinds of questions detailed in the preceding sec-
tion. The third and most important step is to take control and guide the
buyers through the home viewing, property evaluation, home selection, 
and purchase phases.
In the process, be ready to serve as your client’s reality check. More often
than not, you’ll have to lower your buyers’ expectations regarding what their
dollars can buy by gently adjusting their champagne taste buds to align with
what looks more like a beer budget.
It’s Okay to Say No
If the client wants you to do something you feel you can’t, say no. If you can’t
meet them on Saturday, say so. If they’re asking you to write a ridiculous offer
that will only make you look bad to the other agent and seller, say no. If they
want you to participate in a shady transaction where the money trail is cov-
ered, say no.
I was asked many times throughout my career, especially in the early days, 
to engage in transactions with “creative financing.” Less-than-honest buyers
know to seek out new, hungry, and inexperienced agents to work with on
their “innovative” deals. Be aware that too often “creative financing” 
schemes also fit under another category — it’s called fraud!

Ten Biggest Mistakes and 
How to Avoid Them
In This Chapter
 Avoiding the land mines that can derail success
 Knowing what red flags to watch for
A
s the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Consider this short chapter to be your prevention formula. 
Failing to Build Your Real Estate
Practice as a Business
Most real estate agents launch their careers with only two objectives: To
achieve a certain level of income and to enjoy the freedom of self-employment.
Only a rare few start out with the idea of building a business that will grow for
years and that can be sold to someone else in the future.
If you adopt a business owner’s mindset, you’ll derive far greater benefits
from the time, effort, and money you invest in your real estate practice.
Here’s why: You need to make nearly the same investment in marketing
strategies, customer service strategies, and time management techniques
whether you operate as a single agent who sells homes or whether you run a
real estate sales business that employs a team of transaction coordinators,
listing coordinators, and buyer agents.
The difference between how a single agent works and how a real estate sales
business works boils down to this: To build a business, you need to design
and perfect a set of business systems. In addition to the sales and customer
service programs that every real estate agent needs to adopt in order to
build a real estate business, you need to add systems that define how you

hire effectively, train consistently, hold others accountable, and establish,
track, and monitor the performance of the agents who are part of your busi-
ness team.
Over the years, when I’ve been asked to define the secret of my real estate
career success, I’ve always given the same true answer, and it’s never what
the person asking me expects to hear. Without hesitation, I say this: “I’ve
never been a real estate agent. I’ve always been a business person that hap-
pens to sell real estate as part of his business.” That attitude, focus, and busi-
ness approach will deliver more success than you can imagine.
Poor Financial Management
The number one reason people become real estate agents is to become finan-
cially independent. However, remarkably few actually achieve that goal. When
they don’t, most often the culprit, surprisingly, is poor financial management —
not poor earning performance. When it comes to developing wealth, the truth
is that it’s not about what you make. Instead, it’s about what you keep.
I’ve met agents who make half a million or even a million dollars a year in
commissions and yet they’re broke. You read that right: broke! And I’m not
talking about a rare example or two.
Too many agents enter the real estate arena with no business background, a
lack of previous self-employment experience, and a play-now-pay-later mindset.
Most of them end up in big trouble financially. They overspend on business
expenses and then compound the error by overspending on personal expenses
as well. They lack the backstop provided by a good budget that restricts spend-
ing, sets aside funds for taxes, and allows for savings and investments. In other
words, they’re just like most other people in the United States today.
Follow these few simple steps to avoid the financial problems that plague
many agents:
 Establish a business checking account. This separate account ensures
that you don’t mix your personal and business funds and expenses.
Deposit your commission checks into your business checking account
and then pay expenses — including payments to yourself — with busi-
ness revenue.
 Open two business savings accounts. One account can hold funds to
cover your income taxes until they’re due and one can serve as a
reserve account that you draw from in lean commission months.
342
Part V: The Part of Tens 

 Set aside funds for income taxes on an ongoing basis. When you
receive a commission check, deposit the money into your checking
account, and then immediately transfer 20 percent of the commission to
your tax savings account. Doing this protects the funds needed for your
tax obligation and will spare you from the quarterly or annual scramble
that most agents endure when IRS filing deadlines loom.
 Create a business rainy-day fund. At the same time that you transfer 20
percent of your commission check to your tax savings account, transfer
10 percent to your business savings account. If you hit a slow month,
you’ll have a reserve to draw from.
 Set up a retirement plan. Commit to financial success by planning for
your long-term security. Each time you receive a commission check,
direct 10 percent to a simplified employee pension plan, a SIMPLE plan,
a 401(k), a Keogh plan, or an IRA account. If you’re in a higher tax
bracket, the tax benefits alone will deliver you a high first-year rate of
return even if the account doesn’t go up a dime.
 Pay yourself. Set a personal salary amount that you draw monthly from
your company. Pay yourself enough to set aside another 10 percent into
your personal savings account.
 Take advantage of tax deductions. Being a self-employed business
owner delivers many opportunities to create wealth. With those oppor-
tunities come expenses that are often deductible from state and federal
taxes. Meet with an accountant to figure out which expenses are
deductible. Then keep careful track of expenses and deduct every one
that you can when you complete your tax return.
Not Buying Enough of What You Sell
Significant wealth in the real estate arena comes not from the sale of real
estate — though commissions from sales certainly help — but from your own
acquisition and ownership of properties. Inquire and you’ll quickly discover
that the wealthiest agents believed their own sales pitches and purchased
properties regularly and consistently. In fact, I’ve yet to meet a successful
long-time agent who, looking back, thought he or she bought enough. I cer-
tainly fall into that category. But, at least I bought some.
Before I embarked on my real estate career, my father gave me some excel-
lent advice. He said, “Dirk, you need to understand that dentistry didn’t make
me financially independent. My dental practice created the cash flow that
allowed me to make investments in real estate, which in turn created finan-
cial independence. As you build a successful real estate sales business, use
your cash flow to purchase the real estate that will make you wealthy.”

Poor Use of Time
Your time is your most precious finite asset. A finite asset is something that
you cannot grow or expand dramatically in total volume. You have the option
of better use, but you can’t increase the amount. We all have 24 hours in the
day with no hope for acquiring a 25th. Discover ways to control your time
and you’ll be able to control your life, your income, and your wealth. Chapter
16 focuses on nothing but time management. Make time to read it!
Not Investing in Your Most Important
Business Asset: Yourself!
Too many agents spend a fortune on what they wear and what they drive and
spend nothing on the improvement of their skills and mindset.
Look at successful companies and you’ll see that they invest a small fortune
annually on what’s called research and development, or R&D. They spend
this money knowing it will constantly improve the products and services
they offer the public. As a real estate agent you should do the same. Luckily,
though, your R & D takes the form of self-development programs that
improve your skills and mindset, and those hardly cost a fortune.
Dedicate 5 percent to 10 percent of your annual business expense budget to
self-improvement. Then, throughout the year, enroll in courses, buy books, get
involved in coaching, and listen to audio programs to improve your skills —
and your business success.
Making Yourself Available to 
Prospects and Clients 24-7
The most respected professionals are not available to their clients round-the-
clock. They set normal, professional work hours, conduct business in their
offices (where clients come to meet them), and make after-hours appointments
a rare exception.
Doctors, dentists, attorneys, accountants, and financial planners are service
professionals, yet none make themselves available 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week. In contrast, most real estate agents follow a work schedule that runs
practically round-the-clock. What results from this workaholic approach is a
loss of momentum and eventual burnout.

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Give yourself a break. Refer to Chapter 16 to take back control of your time.
Set working hours, manage your days, schedule personal and family time
each day and week, and commit to vacations that allow you to restore your
energy and enthusiasm. Remember, real estate isn’t your life. Rather it’s what
you do to fund your life.
Failing to Communicate Frequently
The biggest complaint of real estate clients is the lack of agent communica-
tion. The solution is to establish a great communication system that you and
your clients both buy into.
As you launch the client-agent relationship, explain the frequency of commu-
nication you plan to have with your clients, and check to make sure that level
of communication meets their needs.
As your clients’ deal becomes a pending transaction, reconfirm the level of
frequency and method of communication they prefer. Some people only need
e-mail updates. Others, like me, prefer the personal connection that a phone
call offers.
Lastly, don’t quit communicating with your clients after your commission
check is cashed. Ongoing communication wins you clients for life and provides
the kind of endorsements that lead to new clients and sales. See the section in
Chapter 15 titled “Creating After-the-Sale Service” for advice on how to win
clients for life.
Being Inconsistent
This is the old tortoise versus the hare lesson. In real estate, as in most other
endeavors, consistency leads to larger-than-expected rewards. However, if
you’re inconsistent, your results will be notably disappointing. Inconsistency
derails success faster than any other factor.
To a real estate agent, the consistent activities of daily prospecting, daily lead
follow-up, daily practice of sales skills, daily personal development, weekly
planning, and scheduled evaluation time create exponential return compared
to the effort invested. On the other hand, occasional bursts of activity create
work with little payoff.
As an easy analogy, say that you want to lose five pounds next month. To
achieve your goal, you figure that you need to increase your physical exer-
cise by running or walking 60 miles over the upcoming 30 days. You could put
345
Chapter 19: Ten Biggest Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

in the miles over a few muscle-aching days (after which you revert to ice
cream sundaes and afternoons on the sofa), or you could commit to walk or
run two miles a day for each of the next 30 days. Which approach do you
think offers the greatest probability of success? The consistent approach
always wins out.
Ignoring the Fundamentals
The fundamentals of real estate sales success aren’t exciting or exhilarating,
and for that reason it’s easy to get sidetracked by new ideas that seem more
interesting and innovative.
Consistent prospecting, client communication, transaction management, and
flawless property marketing are hardly flashy, and they never make headlines
or draw crowds. In fact, on some days these activities are downright boring.
Meanwhile, sales gimmicks generate enthusiasm, attention, and publicity —
even if for just a quick moment in time.
Agents seeking public recognition can count on being rewarded by flashy pro-
motions, but they can’t count on making more money. Repeat this line like a
mantra: You can build your business for your ego or you can build it for your
income, but you can’t do both at the same time. If financial success is your
objective, stick to the fundamentals that are detailed throughout this book.
Talking Too Much, Listening Too 
Little, and Then Going Silent
By design, we have two ears and one mouth. Unfortunately, most of us use
our mouths twice or three times more than we use our ears.
When working with prospects, customers, and clients, follow this advice: Use
your mouth primarily to ask questions. Contrary to popular belief, the person
asking the questions — not the person talking or answering questions — is
really the person in control. After you ask a question, accept and enjoy the
pause and silence that precedes the response. Your power as a salesperson is
intensified if you’re willing to withstand the temptation to barge into the silence
that follows your question. There is an old sales adage, “Whoever talks first,
loses.” It basically is saying that when you ask a question, be quiet. This is
especially true if you ask a closing question or for the order. Be quiet and let
them sign the contract.
