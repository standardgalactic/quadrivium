About the Author
Edward C. Baig writes the weekly Personal Technology column in USA
TODAY and is co-host of the weekly USA TODAY’s Talking Tech with Ed Baig &
Jefferson Graham podcast.
Before joining the paper as a columnist and reporter in 1999, Ed spent six
years at Business Week, where he wrote and edited stories about consumer
tech, personal finance, collectibles, travel, and wine tasting. He received the
Medill School of Journalism 1999 Financial Writers and Editors Award for his
contributions to the “Business Week Investor Guide to Online Investing.” That
came after a three-year stint at U.S. News & World Report, where Ed was the
lead tech writer for the News You Can Use section but also dabbled in numer-
ous other topics. Ed fondly remembers putting together features on baseball
card investing, karaoke machines, and the odd things people collect, includ-
ing Pez dispensers, vintage radios, and “magic” memorabilia.
Ed began his journalistic career at Fortune, gaining the best basic training
imaginable during his early years as a fact checker and contributor to the
Fortune 500. Through the dozen years he worked at the magazine, Ed cov-
ered leisure-time industries, penned features on the lucrative “dating” market
and the effect of religion on corporate managers, and was heavily involved in
the magazine’s Most Admired Companies project. Ed also started up
Fortune’s Products to Watch column, a venue for low- and high-tech items.
Ed has been passionate about gadgets and technology since buying his first
reel-to-reel tape recorder and shortwave radio as a boy. He has also pur-
chased 8-track cartridge players (still in the attic somewhere) and the
Magnavox Odyssey video game console, a forerunner to PONG.
These days, when he’s not spending time with his family or at the keyboard
of his myriad computers, Ed can be found rooting for the New York Giants
and New York Mets, listening to music of all types, and watching movies.
He has a BA in Political Science from York College and an MBA from Adelphi
University.


Dedication
I dedicate this book with love to the ladies in my life, my beautiful wife, 
Janie, for putting up with my messy office and inspiring me daily to do better
things, and my adorable daughter, Sydney, for recognizing (I think) the
phrase “daddy is working” and for lighting up any room she walks into. This
book is also dedicated to my canine “son,” Eddie, for reminding me through
his barks that it is I who live and work in his house.
Author’s Acknowledgments
No book is written in a vacuum; a lot of people are responsible for making it
happen. Let me start by thanking my agent, Matt Wagner, for bringing this
project to me in the first place.
I’d like to thank Project Editor Susan Pink, Acquisitions Manager Bob
Woerner, and Technical Editor Clint McCarty for watching my back and guid-
ing this first-time For Dummies author through the process.
A special word of thanks and respect for the terrific For Dummies writers who
have come before me and set such a high bar for excellence, including David
Pogue and Dan Gookin.
I’d like to thank Jim Henderson and the rest of my USA TODAY colleagues 
for being supportive and putting the newspaper’s stamp of approval on this
project.
Last but not least, I’m appreciative of friends and family members who not
only encouraged me to take on this book but forgave me for not being exactly
swift in initiating or returning phone calls and e-mails. Now I have no more
excuses.

Introduction
W
hat an amazing time to get to know the Mac. For years these elegantly
designed computers have been a model of simplicity and virus-
free stability. Now Macs are undergoing stunning changes that make these
machines even harder to resist.
Apple’s seismic embrace of Intel means you, Mr. or Ms. Computer Buyer, can
have your cake and eat it too. (I love a good cliché when you need it.) You
can benefit from what remains the best marriage in personal computing (the
blessed union between Mac hardware and Mac software). But you no longer
have to ditch the Microsoft Windows–based software you currently use out of
habit, business obligations, or because you don’t know any better.
Indeed, this book is partially targeted at Windows vets who are at least think-
ing about defecting to the Mac. It is also squarely aimed at people who are
new to computers — and the Internet — period.
And though this is primarily a book for beginners, I trust people who have
already dabbled with computers in general and Macs in particular will also
find it useful.
About This Book
A word about the For Dummies franchise I’m now proud to be a part of. These
books are built around the idea that all of us feel like dopes whenever we
tackle something new, especially when the subject at hand (technology)
reeks of a jargon-y stench.
I happen to know you don’t have a dummy bone in your body, and the pub-
lishers at Wiley know it too. Au contraire. (How dumb can you be if you speak
French?) If anything, you’ve already demonstrated smarts by purchasing this
book. You’re ready to plunge into the best computing environment I know of.
Because you’re so intelligent, you’re probably wondering “who is this guy
asking me for 400 pages or so of my time?” Go ahead and read my bio, which
appears just before the Table of Contents.

What you won’t find there is this: I’m a relative latecomer to the Mac. I grew
up on MS-DOS computing and then migrated like most of the rest of the world
into Windows. I still use Windows machines every day.
But I’ve since become a devoted Mac convert and I use my various Apples
every day too. (No snide remarks, please; I find time for other pursuits.)
When writing this book, I vowed to keep the geek-speak to a minimum. I
couldn’t eliminate it entirely and, to be honest, wouldn’t want to. Here’s why:
 You may come across some of these absurdly complicated terms in
advertisements and on the Web. So it’s helpful to have at least a passing
familiarity with some of them.
 Nothing says we can’t poke a little fun now and then at the nerds who
drummed up this stuff.
Conventions Used in This Book
Anyone who has skimmed the pages of this or other For Dummies books
knows they’re not exactly War and Peace. Come to think of it, it’s too bad
Tolstoy got to that name first. Would have made a great title when the defini-
tive account of the Apple-Intel alliance is written.
Macs For Dummies makes generous use of numbered and bulleted lists, and
screen grabs captured, by the way, using a handy little freebie Mac utility
(invaluable to writers of books like this) called Grab. See, you haven’t even
escaped the introduction, and I threw in your first Mac lesson, just like that.
You’ll also note several sidebars in the book, containing material that’s not
part of the required syllabus (well, nothing is really required). I hope you’ll
read them anyhow. Some sidebars are technical in nature, and some provide
a little historical perspective.
How This Book Is Organized
The beauty of the For Dummies format is that you can jump around and read
any section you want. You are not obliged to follow a linear structure. Need
to solve a problem? Head straight to the troubleshooting section (Chapter 20)
and do not pass Go. Want to start putting a coffee table photo book together?
Meet me in Chapter 15. You bring the coffee.
2
Macs For Dummies, 9th Edition 

An organizing principle is at work here. This edition of Macs For Dummies is
split into a half-dozen parts. If you’re new to computing, you might want to
digest this book from start to finish.
Part I: Freshman Year at 
Drag-and-Drop Tech
In Part I, I lay out the groundwork for your Mac education: from turning the
machine on to navigating the Mac desktop. You are introduced to ports and
connectors, the dock, freebie programs, and the various Macs models.
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings
If Part I was mainly for seminars and lectures, Part II is where you get to do
lab work. You find out how to process words and print and how to start taming
the Tiger operating system.
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace
Part III covers all things Internet. You find out how to get connected, conduct
online research, shop, and send e-mail. I also introduce .Mac, Apple’s fee-based
online club.
Part IV: Getting an iLife
In Part IV you really move into the fun stuff, the programs that may have
driven you to purchase a Mac in the first place: iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie HD,
iDVD, GarageBand, and iWeb.
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section
Part V is the part of this computer book that you might imagine is most, well,
like a computer book. Don’t worry, you can read the chapters in this section
without being branded a nerd. In any event, it’s chock-full of practical infor-
mation on networking and diagnosing problems.
3
Introduction

Part VI: The Part of Tens
Listmania is a For Dummies trademark. Check out Part VI for ten Mac-flavored
Web sites, ten dashboard widgets, plus ten more nifty things a Mac can do,
from playing chess to telling a joke.
Icons Used in This Book
Sprinkled through the margins of these pages are round little pictures, or icons.
I could have easily mentioned icons in the “Conventions Used in This Book”
section, because icons are For Dummies conventions too, not to mention essen-
tial ingredients in today’s computers. I use four of them throughout this book.
I present the tip icon when a shortcut or recommendation might make the
task at hand faster or simpler.
This icon is my way of saying pay heed to this passage and proceed gingerly,
lest you wreak the kind of havoc that can cause real and possibly permanent
damage to your computer and (by extension) your wallet.
Some percentage of For Dummies readers will get so hooked on computing they
will become the geeks of tomorrow. These are the people who will welcome the
presence of these pointy-faced little icons. Others among you would rather
swallow turpentine than read an overly technical passage. You can safely
ignore this material. (Still, won’t you be the least bit curious about what it is
you might be missing?)
A remember icon means a point of emphasis is here. So along with remember-
ing where you put the house keys and your spouse’s birthday, you might
want to retain some of this stuff.
Where to Go from Here
I’ve made every effort to get things right and present them in a coherent
manner. But if I’ve erred in any way, confused you, made you mad, whatever,
drop me an e-mail at baigdummies@aol.com. I truly welcome your comments
and suggestions, and I’ll do my best to respond to reasonable queries in a
timely fashion. Mac people aren’t shy about voicing their opinions. Oh, and
since all writers have fragile egos, feel free to send nice e-mails my way too.
Above all, I hope you have fun reading the book and, more importantly, a
grand ole time with your Mac. Thanks for buying the book.

Tech

In this part . . .
E
ven at a party school, you have to enroll in a few 
academic classes. In these early chapters, the course-
work provides you with your first glimpse at the tools and
programs that make Macs so appealing. Plus, the home-
work is light.
You’ve chosen an excellent major.

In This Chapter
 Discovering why your computer is special

 Introducing the iLife
 Going outside the box
 Computing safely
F
orgive me for getting too personal right off the bat, but next to your
spouse or significant other, is there anyone or anything you touch more
often than a computer keyboard? Or gaze at more intensely than a monitor?
If this is your initial dalliance with a Macintosh, you are probably already
smitten. And quite possibly at the start of a lifelong affair.
Despite its good looks, the Mac is much more than a trophy computer. You
can admire the machine for flaunting intelligent design, versatility, and tough-
ness. A Mac can take care of itself. As of this writing, the Mac has avoided the
scourge of viruses that plague PCs based on Microsoft Windows. Apple’s dar-
lings are a lot more stable too, so they crash and burn less often.
Mac-Spectacular Computing
You shouldn’t be alarmed that far fewer people own Macs compared with
PCs. That’s like saying more people drive Chevy’s than Ferraris. By my way 
of thinking, strength in numbers is overrated.
Besides, as a new member of the Mac community consider the company 
you are about to keep. Mac owners tend to belong to the cool crowd: artists,
designers, performers, and (can’t resist this one) writers.

For sure, these same people can be smug at times. I’ve had Mac mavens go
ballistic on me for penning positive reviews that were not flattering enough.
Or for even daring to suggest that Macs aren’t always perfect.
The machines come pretty darn close, though, so if you’re new to the Mac
you’re in for a treat. It has been suggested that most Windows users go to
their computers to complete the task at hand and be done with it. The Mac
owner also gets things done, of course. The difference is that machines
branded with the Apple logo tend to be a labor of love. Moreover, now that
Intel is inside newer Macs, Apple’s computer can double as a pretty darn
effective Windows machine.
Oh, and you will always remember the first time.
Checking out shapes and sizes
When people speak of the Mac, they may refer to both the physical machine
or hardware and the operating system software that makes it all tick. One is
worthless without the other. On a Mac, the operating system is called OS X
(pronounced oh-S-ten). The latest version also carries a ferocious moniker,
Tiger (see Chapter 6 for more on the operating system), with Leopard poised
to follow.
Apple Computer has a tremendous advantage over the companies promoting
Windows PCs because it is the single entity responsible for producing not
only the computer itself but also the important software that choreographs
the way the system behaves. Everything is simpatico.
That’s in stark contrast to the way of the PC world. Companies such as Dell
and Hewlett-Packard manufacture hardware. Microsoft produces the Windows
software that fuels the machines. Sure these companies maintain close rela-
tionships. They just don’t share Apple’s blood relationships.
You will find a variety of Macintoshes meant to sit on top of your desk, thus
the term desktop computer. These are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4.
Just know for now that the main examples of the breed are the iMac, the Mac
Mini, and the Power Mac.
Mac laptops, so named because they rest on your lap and are portable, include
the MacBook and the MacBook Pro. They are sometimes referred to as note-
book computers or just plain notebooks. As with spiral notebooks, they can fit
into a briefcase.
8
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

Seeing what they do best
Like any computer that’s been around since the Middle Ages (or at least the
latter stages of the twentieth century), the Mac is adept at handling mundane
tasks, from crunching numbers to processing words. Where Apples truly
shine, though, is in making your pictures, music, and videos come alive.
You need not run out to purchase a lot of excess software, either (though
there’s plenty of dandy programs to be had). That’s because you can do so
much with the software already on hand.
Matching a Mac to your needs
Haven’t settled on which Mac to buy? This book provides assistance. Cheap
advice: If you can eyeball the computers in person, by all means do so. Apple
operates more than 100 retail stores in North America, plus outlets in the
United Kingdom and Japan. Trolling through these high-tech candy stores is 
a delight. Of course, you can also buy Macs on the Internet or in traditional
“brick and mortar” computer stores.
Just be prepared to part with some loot. Although the gap between the cost
of PCs and Macs is narrowing, you will typically pay more for a Mac versus a
comparable unit on the PC side.
(Uh oh! The Mac diehards are boiling at that remark: I can practically see
their heads exploding as they rant: “There is no such thing as a comparable
Windows machine.”)
Keep in mind that students are often eligible for discounts on computers.
Check with your college or university bookstore. Apple also gives breaks to
faculty, administrators, and K-12 teachers.
Selecting handy peripherals
As you might imagine, Macs complement the full range of peripherals.
Although much of what you create in bits and bytes, to put it in computer-
speak, stays in that electronic form, at some point you’re probably going 
to want to print your work. On old-fashioned paper, no less. Fortunately, a
number of excellent printers work with Macs. I provide details in Chapter 8.
9
Chapter 1: Adventuring into the Mac World

You may also choose a scanner, which in some respects is the opposite of a
printer. That’s because you start with an image that’s already in paper form,
and scan, or translate, it into a form your computer can understand and 
display.
Some machines combine printing and scanning functions, often with copier
and fax capabilities as well. These are called multifunction or all-in-one
devices.
Hooking Up Is a Snap
Connecting electronics gear is often a frightening experience. For example,
figuring out the cords and cables in a home theater system is a bit like solv-
ing a challenging SAT problem. No wonder so many folks are willing to pay
some brainy technician a small ransom to do the deed for them. Or else
they’re practically begging the nerdy neighbor across the street to lend a
helping hand.
Relax. You won’t need the smarts of a Nobel laureate to hook up a Mac. As
you’ll see in the Chapter 2, even a kid who has barely learned to ride a bike can
do it. Come to think of it, that kid may need this book a lot less than you do.
Communicating with Your Mac
The Mac isn’t at all standoffish like some human objects of affection. It is
friendly and approachable. In this section, I tell you how.
It’s a GUI
Every mainstream computer in operation today employs what’s called a
graphical user interface, or GUI. The Mac’s GUI is arguably the most inviting of
all. It consists of colorful objects or pictures on your screen, plus windows
and menus (Chapter 3). You interact with these (using a computer mouse) to
tell your machine and its various programs how to behave. Sure beats typing
instructions as arcane commands or taking a crash course in programming.
Even though GUI is pronounced “gooey,” there’s nothing remotely yucky
about it.
10
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

With great tools for you
Given its versatility, I’ve often thought a Mac would make a terrific product to
peddle on one of those late-night infomercials. “It slices, it dices. Why it even
does more than a Ginsu Knife or Popeil Pocket Fisherman!”
Indeed, have you ever paused to consider what a computer is anyhow? Let’s
consider a few of its most primitive (albeit handy) functions. A Mac can
 Tell time
 Display family portraits
 Solve arithmetic
 Play movies
 Let you chat with friends
I dare say you didn’t surrender a grand or two for a simple clock, photo album,
calculator, DVD player, or telephone. But it’s sure nice having all those capabili-
ties in one place, and as that TV announcer might bark, “that’s not all folks.”
I can’t possibly rattle off all the nifty things a Mac can do in this one section
(besides, I encourage you to read the rest of the book). But whether you
bought or intend to buy a Mac for work, play, or more likely some combina-
tion of the two, some little birdie tells me the contents of the Mac’s tool chest
will surpass your expectations.
And output, too
I’m quite confident that you will spend many pleasurable hours in front of
your computer. At the end of the day, though, you’re going to want to show
other people how productive and clever you’ve been. So whether you pro-
duce documents for a legal brief, spiffy newsletters for the PTA, or music CDs
to serve as the soundtrack to your fraternity’s big bash, the Mac will again
make you proud.
Living the iLife
All the latest Macs are loaded with a terrific suite of software programs called
iLife to help you master the digital lifestyle you are about to become accus-
tomed to. (On older systems, you can purchase the upgraded iLife suite of
11
Chapter 1: Adventuring into the Mac World

programs.) I dig deeper into the various iLife components throughout Part IV.
Here’s a sneak preview:
 iPhoto: The great photographer Ansel Adams would have had a field day
with iPhoto. This software lets you organize and share your best pictures
and place them in calendars and coffee table books.
 iMovie HD: Can an Academy Award be far behind? iMovie is all about
applying cinematic effects to turn your video into a piece of high-
minded art that would make Martin Scorsese proud. (Or maybe the kind
of Hollywood fluff that generates a box-office bonanza.) Who knows,
maybe Apple boss Steve Jobs will find work for you at Disney or Pixar.
 iDVD: Use this program to create DVDs with chapters like the films you
rent at the video store.
 GarageBand: Did somebody mention groupies? GarageBand lets you
make music using “virtual” software instruments. The latest version also
can help you create online radio shows, or podcasts.
 iWeb: The newest member of the iLife troupe is all about helping you
create your own Web site.
Reaching Outside the Box
The modern computing experience extends well beyond the inner workings
of the physical contraption on your desk. Computing is more about what
occurs in the magical kingdom of cyberspace, better known to the public as
the Internet.
Getting online
In Chapter 9, you discover all there is to know about finding your way to 
the Internet, and the many paths you can take once you get there. The Mac
comes with the software you need to get started and (depending on your
model) the circuitry required to connect online through fast broadband
methods. Older machines may still dial up the Internet.
Networking with or without wires
Ask a few people to explain what networking is all about and they’ll probably
utter something about trying to meet and cozy up to influential people who
might help them advance their careers or social lives.
12
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

A Mac can help with such things, too, but that’s not the kind of networking I
have in mind. Computer networks are about having two or more machines
communicate with one another to share files, pictures, music and, most
importantly, a connection to various online outposts. Even on a Mac, this net-
working business can get kind of geeky, though Apple does as well as anyone
in helping to simplify the process. You can network by connecting certain
cords and cables. The preferred method is do so without wires. This is all
explained in Chapter 18.
Staying Safe and Trouble-Free
As noted, the Mac has historically been able to avoid the nasty viruses and
other malevolent programs that give Windows owners the heebie-jeebies. In
the nastiest scenarios, those Windows machines (or certain programs) are
shut down, and personal information is surreptitiously lifted.
In this day and age, not even Mac owners should let their guard down. (And
remember, in some instances the Mac can become a Windows machine.)
Chapter 13 offers counsel on avoiding online dangers.
No matter how much care and feeding went into producing these beautiful
computers, when all is said and done we are talking about physical contrap-
tions filled with circuits and silicon. Machines do break, or at the very least
get cranky like your 2-year-old. So drop by Chapter 20 as well, where I outline
common troubleshooting steps you can take to ensure that you and your
computer develop your relationship gracefully. Consider it the high-tech
alternative to couple’s counseling.

The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac

 Saving to the hard drive
 Mastering memory
 Finding common ports and connectors
H
ave you taken the plunge and purchased the computer? If so, you’ve
made a fabulous decision.
I bet you’re dying to get started. You may even have gotten going without
reading these initial instructions. Fine with me. No offense taken. The Mac is
intuitive, after all, and the title on this cover notwithstanding, you’re no
dummy. I know because you had the good sense to buy a Macintosh — and
this book. Besides, what would it say about Apple’s product designers if they
couldn’t make you understand how to turn on the computer?
If you didn’t jump the gun, that’s cool too. That’s why your humble servant,
um, author, is here.
Turning On and Tuning In Your Mac
To borrow a line from a famous musical, “Let’s start at the very beginning, a
very good place to start . . .” In the Do-Re-Mi’s of Macintosh computing, plug-
ging the computer in the wall is a very good place to start. It doesn’t get a
whole lot more complicated from there.

16
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 
The on button
Take a second to locate the round on, or power, button (Figure 2-1). Where it
resides depends on the Mac model you purchased, but finding it shouldn’t be
too taxing. I’ll even give away the secret on recently issued models. On the
latest iMac, the on button is on the lower-left back panel of the monitor. On
MacBook Pro laptops, the button is to the right of the keyboard.
Go ahead and press it now. Explosive things are about to happen. Not those
kinds of explosives; it’s just that igniting your first session on the Mac makes
you da bomb (translation: college slang for awesome or cool).
To let you know all is peachy (or should I say Apple-y), you hear a musical
chime (see the sidebar) while the Apple logo briefly shows up on the screen
in front of a gray background.
Getting credentials
Powering up a new Mac for the first time may make you feel like you’re enter-
ing the United Nations. After the Apple logo disappears, a lengthy interroga-
tion process commences.
You are kindly instructed to pledge allegiance to a particular language. Deutsch
als Standardsprache verwenden and Gebruik Nederlands als hoofdtaal are
among the 15 choices in a drop-down menu. If you don’t know what either of
On button
Figure 2-1:
The on
button is
where it all
starts.

these means, you probably ought to make another choice. In any case, choose
your selection by clicking with the mouse (see details later in this chapter) or
pressing Enter or Return on the keyboard.
If you select Use English as the main language (as I did), you’re treated to a
short movie welcoming you in several different languages to OS X Tiger, the
Mac’s operating system software. Next, you get to tell your nosy computer
your country or region (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia,
New Zealand, Ireland, and so on). There’s no need to whip out a passport.
At this stage you have the option to hear instructions for setting up your
Mac. To do so, press the Escape key.
If you happen to own another Mac, you can then transfer network settings,
user accounts, documents, applications, files, e-mail, and various preferences
from that other computer to this one. The process involves connecting a
FireWire cable, which you discover more about later in this chapter.
You also are presented with the option to transfer information from another
partition on this Mac. That’s a geeky term we’ll skip for now.
Of course, if this is your maiden voyage on the SS Macintosh, the previous
choices are unimportant. Instead, select the box “Do not transfer my informa-
tion” and click Continue.
As the cross-examination goes on, you get to choose a keyboard layout and
then select any available wireless Internet service to use.
The next step is to enter your Apple ID, assuming you have one. Such creden-
tials let you buy stuff later.
17
Chapter 2: The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac
The Fab Four chime?
That musical chord you hear just after pressing
the on button may sound vaguely familiar. For a
long time I thought it was the same chime that
ends the Beatles’ A Day In The Life. I was mis-
taken. Former hippies, flower children, baby
boomers, and just about everyone else con-
scious during the 1960s may wish it were so. For
one thing, Macs are sold with iLife software.
Wouldn’t it be groovy to make a nexus between
iLife and the Beatle’s Life? Moreover, John,
Paul, George, and Ringo famously recorded on
the Apple record label. (Anyone remember
records?) I’ve read that’s one reason Beatles
fan and Apple cofounder Steve Jobs chose
Eve’s forbidden fruit as a name for his upstart
company. Even if the Beatles connection is
bunk, it makes a good story. The sad reality is
that the Beatles’ Apple Corps has a history of
suing Apple Computer over trademark issues.
So much for giving peace a chance.

Before completing this drill, you are also asked to reveal your name, address,
phone number, and (again if you have one) e-mail address. You can’t say no,
(though I suppose you can fib).
Distrustful types can click to read Apple’s privacy policy. Best I can tell, no
one will ask for your social security number or driver’s license.
Still, the prying goes on. Apple next wants to know what you do for a living
(“Other” is a safe choice in the drop-down menu) and where you will primar-
ily use the computer. You also get to tell Apple whether to keep you abreast
on company news, software updates, and the latest products and services.
Opting-in is entirely up to you. Just be aware that you have to remove the
check mark in the box to opt-out.
Creating an identity
You’re almost ready to begin touring the computer. But not quite. An impor-
tant step remains. You must choose an identity, or user account. This tells the
Mac that you are the Grand Poobah of this particular computer. As this
almighty administrator, you and you alone can subsequently add accounts for
other members of your family or workplace, each with a password that keeps
them from snooping into one another’s computing workspace (Chapter 5).
Type the name of the account holder (for example, Cookie Monster), the short
name (Cookie), the password (chocolatechip or better yet something that’s
harder to guess), and to verify the password (chocolatechip or whatever
again). You are also asked to type a password hint (yummy flavor) as a gentle
reminder should you ever forget your password. Failing to remember things
may not happen to you, but it sure happens to me.
On newer models with a built-in camera you will also be asked at this stage to
choose an account picture. Better not be camera-shy, because this too you
can’t refuse.
Time is on your side
Because it probably already seems like day is turning into night, this is as
appropriate a time as any to, well, select your time zone by clicking near
where you live on the world map that appears. If you’re connected to the
Internet, the computer already knows the date and time. If not, you can enter
them now.

Registering your Mac
When all is said and done, the nice folks at Apple would also like you to regis-
ter the Mac. You can put this off till later or forever. Letting Apple know who
you are gives the company the opportunity to flood you with promotional
e-mail. That too is up to you.
Making acquaintances
The welcome screen lists all the people on the computer with a user account,
each with a personal mug shot or other graphical thumbnail next to their
names. Click the name or picture next to the miniature picture or thumbnail.
You’re asked to enter your password (assuming you have one). Type it prop-
erly, and you are transported to the main working area, or desktop.
The desktop I am referring to here is the interface you see on the computer
display, not to be confused with a desktop-type machine.
Shutting down
We began this chapter with a noble discussion of how to turn on the Mac.
(Humor me if you didn’t think the discussion was even remotely noble.) So
even though you barely have your feet wet, I’m going to tell you how to turn
the dang thing off. Don’t you just hate people who not only give away the
ending (it’s the butler) but also tell you to do something and then tell you
why you shouldn’t have done it?
Okay. Ready? Sayonara time.
Using the arrow-shaped cursor, which you control with your mouse, stab the
small Ú logo found at the upper-left corner of the screen. Click once and a
drop-down menu appears. Move the cursor down until the Shut Down entry
is highlighted. You know a command or entry is highlighted because a blue
strip appears over its name.
Pressing Enter on the keyboard or clicking Shut Down brings up what’s called
a dialog box (see Figure 2-2). I’m no shrink, but it’s obvious based on the
question the computer asks inside this box that it suffers from separation
anxiety. “Are you sure you want to shut down your computer now?”
19
Chapter 2: The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac

Do nothing, and the machine will indeed turn itself off in two minutes. If you
want to say so long immediately, click the button labeled Shut Down.
Having second thoughts? Click Cancel.
Giving your Mac a nap
Apart from guilt, why not shut down? The main reason is that you can let the
computer catch a few Zs without turning it off. A sleeping Mac consumes far
less energy than one that’s in a conscious state. Mac’s don’t snore, but you
know they’re alive because of a dim blinking light. As it turns out, your
machine is a light sleeper. You can wake it up right away by pressing any key
on the keyboard. Best of all, whatever you happened to be working on is just
where you left it. You have to begin from scratch when you restart a Mac that
you had completely shut down.
If you’re going to leave the Mac on for an extended period of time, make sure
it’s plugged in to a surge protector that can protect the machine from lightning.
You can make a Mac laptop go to sleep immediately by shutting its cover. To
make a desktop machine go to sleep, click the Sleep command on the Ú
menu.
Mousing Around the Interface
By now you’re catching on to the idea that this computing business requires
a lot more clicking than Dorothy had to do to get back to Kansas. She used
ruby slippers. You get to use a mouse.
A computer mouse is generally less frightening than that other kind of critter.
In keeping with this Wizard of Oz comparison, not even the Cowardly Lion
would be scared of it. And though your high-tech rodent can get finicky at
times, you’re unlikely to set traps to bring about its demise.
Figure 2-2:

Some mice connect to the computer through cords. Some are wireless. Either
way, they’re called pointing devices because — brace yourself for this
advanced concept — they’re devices that sort of point.
I’ll explain. You roll the mouse across a flat surface (typically your desk, per-
haps a specialized mouse pad). As you do so, a cursor, or insertion point, on
the screen miraculously apes the movement of your hand gliding the mouse.
(Note to self: The mixed metaphor police, a.k.a. my editor, must love mention
of a mouse and a monkey in the same breath. Or perhaps not.) If the mouse
loses touch with the surface of your desk, the cursor will no longer move.
When you place the cursor precisely where you want it, you’re ready for the
clicking part. Place your index finger on the upper-left portion of the mouse,
press down quickly, and let go. You’ll hear a clicking sound, and in some
cases your entire body will tingle with satisfaction. You have indeed mas-
tered the fine art of clicking.
Don’t get too cocky. Now try double-clicking, an action often required to get
something accomplished. You’re pretty much repeating the preceding exer-
cise, only now you’re clicking twice in rapid succession while keeping the
cursor in the same location. It may take a little practice. But you’ll get it.
Left- and right-clicking
If you’ve been using a Windows computer, you’re accustomed to working with a
mouse that has two or more buttons. More times than not you click, or double-
click, using the upper-left button. That’s where the remarkably unoriginal name
of left-clicking comes from. Left-clicking usually serves the purpose of selecting
things on the screen. By contrast, the opposite action, right-clicking, brings up a
menu of shortcut commands.
Until recently, the typical Apple mouse had just one button, the functional
equivalent of the left button on a Windows mouse. (Apple’s programmable
Mighty Mouse, included with recent Macs, can behave like a multibutton
mouse.) Having just one button on a Mac is less of a big deal than some think.
That’s because you can effectively right-click, or bring up a shortcut menu,
with a one-button Mac mouse anyway. To accomplish this great feat, press
Control on the keyboard while you click.
Pointing and clicking on a laptop
You can attach a regular mouse to any Mac laptop, but it is not always conve-
nient to use one when you’re on a 747 or working in tight quarters.
21
Chapter 2: The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac

Fortunately, Mac portables have something called a trackpad, a smooth area
just below the keyboard. You glide your finger on the trackpad to choreo-
graph the movement of the cursor. The button just below the trackpad han-
dles clicking chores.
What a drag
The mouse is responsible for at least one other important bit of business:
dragging. Position the cursor on top of the symbol or icon you want to drag.
Then hold down the mouse button and roll the mouse across your desk. As
you do so, the icon moves to a new location on the screen.
Knowing What’s Handy about 
the Keyboard
As with any computer — or an old-fashioned typewriter for that matter — the
Mac keyboard is laid out QWERTY style, meaning the top row of letters starts
out with Q, W, E, R, T, and Y. But a computer keyboard also contains a bunch
of specialized keys that the inventors of the typewriter wouldn’t have
dreamed of.
Apple sells localized versions of its keyboards for use in different parts of the
world. In North America, the keyboard standard is known as ANSI, in Japan
it’s JIS, and in Europe, ISO.
Finding the major functions
The top row of the Mac keyboard carries a bunch of keys with the letter F fol-
lowed a number. From left to right, you go from F1, F2, F3, all the way out (in
some cases) to F16. These are your loyal function keys, and their particular
marching orders vary among Mac models. Depending on your setup, pressing
certain F keys has no effect at all.
The F9, F10, F11, and F12 may all relate to a Mac feature called Exposé, which
I explain in Chapter 5.
On Mac laptops, the F1 and F2 keys can raise or lower the brightness of your
screen. On other types of Macs, F14 and F15 perform those functions.
22
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

The keys you use every day
Quick quiz? Guess which keys you employ most often? Too easy. The keys
you use every day are the ones representing vowels and letters with low
point values in Scrabble.
Naturally, these aren’t the only keys that work overtime. The space bar,
comma, and period are darn busy. If you’re into hyperbole, the exclamation
mark key puts in an honest day’s effort too. Don’t let me shortchange Shift or
Return. And I know you accountants in the crowd spend a lot of time ham-
mering away at all those number keys.
More keys to success
You’ll find these other keys extremely useful:
 esc: The great Escape key. The equivalent of clicking Cancel in a dialog box.

: These lower, raise, or mute the volume of the computer’s
speakers, though in laptops certain function keys perform these duties.

: No doubt this is James Bond’s favorite key. Press it, and one of two
things is supposed to happen. On most newer Macs, a CD or DVD loaded
inside the guts of the computer spits out of a hidden slot. On other
models, the tray holding the disc slides out.
 Delete, delete: You are not reading double. There are two delete keys on
some Mac keyboards, each with different assignments. Regular delete is
your backspace key. Press it, and it erases the character directly to the
left of the cursor. The second delete key, which sometimes appears as
Del and sometimes as delete accompanied by an x inside a small penta-
gon is the forward delete key. It wipes out the character to right of the
cursor. Confusingly, on some laptops you can purge the letter to the
right of the cursor by pressing fn and delete at the same time.
 Home, End: The jumpiest keys you will come across. Press Home and
you’re instantly vaulted to the top of the document or Web page window
in which you are working. Press End, and the opposite occurs; you
plunge to the bottom.
 Page Up, Page Down: A mouse alternative for moving up or down one
huge gulp or screenful at a time.
 Option: Pressing Option (labeled Alt Option on some keyboards) at 
the same time that you press another specific key generates symbols.
You can’t possibly recall them all, though over time, you’ll learn the key
23
Chapter 2: The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac

combinations for symbols you regularly call upon. For example, press
Option and 2 for ™, Option and V for √, and Option and R for ®. Feel free
to play around with other combinations.
 Control: The Control key and the mouse click make a powerful combina-
tion. Control-clicking yields pop-up contextual menus that only make
sense in the moment. For example, control-clicking a term inside the
Microsoft Word word processing program brings up a menu that lets you
find a synonym for that word, among other options. Because finding a
synonym doesn’t make a lot of sense when you control-click a picture
inside iPhoto (Chapter 15), the action opens up different possibilities,
including editing, rotating, and duplicating an image.
 Ô: Pressing this cloverleaf key at the same time you press another key-
board character creates keyboard shortcuts, a subject worthy of its own
topic (see the next section).
Taking a shortcut
If you hold the mouse in high regard, you may want to give the little fellow
time off now and then. (Just don’t tell him that you can sometimes move
much faster without him.) That’s the beauty of keyboard shortcuts. When
you simultaneously press Ô and a given key, stuff happens. You just have to
remember which combination of keys to use under which circumstances.
To understand how such shortcuts work, consider the popular act of copying
material from one program and reproducing it in another. You are about to
practice copy-and-paste surgery.
I present two ways to do this. One leaves pretty much everything up to your
mouse. The other, while still using a mouse a little, mainly exploits keyboard
shortcuts.
Using the first option:
1. Use the mouse to highlight, or select, the passage you want to copy.
2. On the menu bar at the top of the screen, choose Edit➪Copy.
3. Move the mouse and click to place your mouse at the point where you
want to paste the text.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste.
The copied material magically appears at its new destination.
24
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

Here is the keyboard shortcut method:
1. Highlight the text you want to copy.
2. Hold down the Ô key while you press the C key.
The result is the same as if you clicked Edit and Copy.
3. Move the mouse and click to place the mouse at the point where you
want to paste.
4. Press Ô and the V key.
You just pasted the text.
Many clickable menu items have keyboard equivalents. These shortcuts are
displayed in the various menus to the right of their associated commands, as
shown in Figure 2-3. Notice that some keyboard shortcuts shown in the menu
appear dimmed. That’s because the commands can’t be used at this particular
point.
Storing Stuff on the Hard Drive
You keep lots of things on a computer. Software you’ve added. Photos, songs,
movies. Your graduate thesis examining Simon Cowell’s grip on young
American divas. What’s more, before you even arrived on the scene, your
friends at Apple left a lot of stuff behind too, mainly the files and programs
that make your Mac special.

Chapter 2: The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac

The bottom line: Computers are a lot like houses. The longer you stick
around, the more clutter you accumulate. And despite your best rainy day
intentions, you almost never seem to get rid of the junk.
Besides, you have plenty of treasures worth holding on to, and you need a
place to store them. The great storage closet on your computer is called the
hard drive, and just as with a physical closet, the bigger it is, the better. You
may even choose to eventually add a new closet or second hard drive. (Some
people add a second disk drive when they buy a new computer.) You can
almost always take advantage of the extra storage. Plus, you can use an addi-
tional hard drive to back up, or keep a copy of, your most precious digital
keepsakes. Hard drives can be fragile.
Indeed, this is a point I cannot ram into your heads hard enough: Back up,
back up, back up. I warn you about this again in Chapter 20.
Memory Essentials, or RAM On
Notice my not-so-subtle use of the word ram in the preceding section? That’s
to get you thinking about the other kind of RAM. It stands for Random Access
Memory, or, mercifully, just memory for short. (I can’t help but think that
accessing my own memory is random, which may explain why I can recall
things from the third grade but not yesterday.) Just as you want as capacious
a hard drive as possible, you want to load as much RAM into your system as
you can possibly afford.
Here’s why. The hard drive is the place for your long-term storage require-
ments. RAM is temporary storage, and having lots of RAM on hand helps when
you open several programs at once and work with large documents. You may
be editing videos, listening to music, and crunching numbers, all while paus-
ing your work to defend the planet by deep-sixing evil aliens. Dude, you are
doing some serious high-tech juggling, otherwise known as multitasking.
Multitaskers guzzle up RAM.
Geeks refer to the amount of memory and hard drive space you have in terms
of bits and bytes. The itsy-bitsy bit (short for binary digit) is the tiniest unit of
information handled by a computer. Eight bits make up a byte, and a byte
typically represents a letter, a punctuation mark, or a digit on your screen. I
know. That’s an awful lot to chew, um, byte on.
You’ll typically see measurements in kilobytes, or KB (actually 1,024 bytes),
megabytes, or MB (1,048,576 bytes), and gigabytes, or GB (1,073,741,824
bytes). To provide a little perspective, at the time of this writing, the least
expensive iMac model comes with a 160GB hard drive and 512MB of RAM.

Locating the Common Port 
and Connectors
Industry standard jacks, holes, and connectors on the back or side of your
Mac (depending on whether you have a desktop or laptop) may look funky.
But you can’t live without (most) of them. They are your bridge to the gaggle
of devices and peripherals that want to have a relationship with your com-
puter (see Figure 2-4).
Peripherally speaking: 
USB versus FireWire
Ralph Kramden presumably never drove a Universal Serial Bus. But you will
take the USB route quite often. That’s because USB (pronounced “you-S-bee”)
connects printers, scanners, digital cameras, webcams, iPods, joysticks,
speakers, keychain disk drives, piano keyboards, and even your mouse and
computer keyboard.
Plugging in a USB device is as simple as, well, plugging it in (though sometimes
you have to load software first). You can often remove USB devices from the
computer without causing harm by merely pulling the cable out of the jack.
Sometimes, however, the Mac prefers that you let it know before pulling out
the cable. To remove an iPod connected by USB, for example, your Mac
wants you to click a tiny little icon in the iTunes software source list, next to
the name you’ve assigned the portable music player. Failure to click the icon
can cause unpleasant consequences. (For complete details on iPods and
iTunes, let me refer you to Chapter 14.)
Figure 2-4:
Hook me up,
Scotty.
27
Chapter 2: The Nuts and Bolts of Your Mac

USB generally works like a charm. But like most things in life, there are occa-
sional drawbacks. For one, given all the devices that love USB, you may run
out of available ports. In that case, you can buy a USB expansion hub. If you
do so, I recommend a hub that you can plug into an electrical outlet.
Many USB devices don’t require any kind of electrical outlet because they
draw power from the Mac itself. You can recharge an iPod, for example, by
plugging it into a Mac’s USB port. That’s the good news. But some available
USB ports, typically those that reside on the keyboard, are relative weaklings.
They work fine with low-power devices such as your mouse but not with, say,
a power-thirsty digital camera. If you plug a USB device into a port in the key-
board and it doesn’t work, try plugging it into a USB port directly on the back
or side of the computer.
FireWire is the friendly name coined by Apple for a connector that is also
known by the unfortunate descriptor IEEE 1394. (I won’t bore you with an
explanation except to say it’s the reason engineers are engineers and not
marketers.) FireWire is a speedy connector often used with digital cam-
corders. But it also connects iPods and external hard drives.
FireWire comes in two flavors, the older FireWire 400 specification and its
faster cousin, FireWire 800. Only certain Macs can handle the speedier guy.
Two of a kind: The phone jack 
and Ethernet
The phone jack on some Macs is identical to the wall outlet where you plug in
a regular phone. You connect a phone line to this jack to take advantage of a
dial-up modem to the Internet (Chapter 9). Now that we’ve entered the
speedy broadband era, dial-up modems are yesterday’s news, which is why
Apple no longer considers them standard issue on newer Macs. That’s unfor-
tunate because you may still encounter situations where dial-up is your only
option. Apple sells optional USB dial-up modems for just that situation.
The end of the cable that plugs into an Ethernet jack looks just like a phone
jack on steroids. In fact, Ethernet and phone cords are easily mistaken.
Ethernet’s main purpose in life is to provide a fast outlet to the Internet or
your office computer network.
28
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

Jacks of all trades
The following connectors are used less often:
 Video output jack: This connects a Mac to an external monitor for, say,
giving classroom presentations.
 External Apple monitor: Apple’s own proprietary jack for connecting
one of its own monitors.
 Lock: Found on laptops, this tiny hole is where you fit in a Kensington
Security lock cable. With one end securely attached to the computer,
you loop a Kensington cable around the leg of a heavy desk or other
immovable object. The hope is that you’ll prevent a thief from walking
off with your notebook. The laptop cable is similar to a bicycle lock and
cable that you wrap around the wheel and a pole to prevent a heist.
 Headphones: For playing games or taking in tunes without bothering
your next-door neighbor or cubby mate.
 S-video: A special cable for connecting the computer to a TV, DVD
player, or projector hooks up here. That way, you can watch a DVD in
your Mac on a large screen. You can add an inexpensive S-video adapter
to models that don’t include this connector.
 ExpressCard slot: The slot (for adding memory card readers or TV
tuners) is a relatively new standard that has started to replace the PC
Card slot you find on older Mac notebooks.
Making the right connections on your computer, as in life, can take you a long
way.

lthough I’m quite positive he never used a personal computer a day in
his life, the wise Chinese philosopher Confucius could have had the Mac
in mind when he said, “If you enjoy what you do, you’ll never work another
day in your life.” People surely enjoy their Macs, even when they are doing
work on the machine. Before you can totally whoop it up, however, it is help-
ful to get down a few more basics. That way you’ll better appreciate why this
particular Apple is so yummy.
Navigating the Mac Desktop
All roads lead to and depart from the computer’s desktop, a confusing name if
ever there was one. In this context, I do not mean the physical hardware that
might sit on top of, say, a mahogany desktop. I also don’t mean the kind of
desktop you might buy instead of a laptop.
Rather, this is the desktop that takes over the whole of your computer
screen. On a PC, this is known as the Windows desktop. On a Macintosh, it is
the Mac desktop or (as a homage to the machine’s operating system) the
Tiger desktop.
There’s yet another name, Finder, because as Apple’s own marketers put it,
“Everything you need, just a click away.”

32
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 
Indeed, the desktop, or Finder, is a launch pad for all that you may do on your
computer. It is the scenic landscape upon which you organize and store things.
Have a peek at Figure 3-1, which shows a typical Mac desktop layout. The
background is blue by default. You can alter that and make other cosmetic
changes (see Chapter 5). The time is displayed near the upper-right corner of
the screen, and there’s a trash can at the bottom right. Look around and
you’ll see other funky looking graphical icons on the screen.
Let me try this comparison. A Major League ballpark always has foul lines,
bases 90 feet apart, and a pitcher’s rubber 60 feet and 6 inches from home
plate. These are standard rules to be followed. But outfield dimensions and
seating capacities vary dramatically. So do dugouts, bullpens, and stadium
architecture.
Certain conventions apply to the Mac desktop too; then you can deviate from
those conventions. So in the end, everyone’s Mac desktop will look different, a
subject treated in Chapter 4. For now, I address some of the main conventions.

Clicking the Menu Bar
See the narrow strip extending across the entire top of the desktop screen?
Yes, the one with the little picture of an Apple at the extreme left side, and
words such as File, Edit, and View to its right? This is your menu bar, so-
named because clicking the Apple — or any of the words in the strip —
brings up a menu, or list, of commands. (Sorry, it’s not that kind of menu. You
can’t order cocktails.)
Single-click the Apple, and a menu pops up with some important functions.
Readers of Chapter 2 are already familiar with the Sleep and Shut Down com-
mands. You will also find Software Update, System Preferences, Force Quit,
and other commands I revisit throughout this book. Suffice to say, the Apple
menu is so relevant that it is always available from whichever application
you’re working in.
Now click the top item under the Ú menu, About This Mac. The window that
appears lets you know the version of the Mac OS X operating system soft-
ware you’re running (see Chapter 6), the kind of processor, or main chip, that
the system is operating on, and the amount of memory onboard.
Click More Info in the same window, and the System Profiler appears (Figure
3-2). Among other things, you can find your machine’s serial number, darn
useful information if you are ever captured by the enemy. I trust you already
know your name and rank. (According to the Geneva Conventions, that’s all
you need to reveal to Microsoft.)
Most of the rest of the stuff, frankly, is a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo pre-
sented in list form. However, some information is worth knowing, including a
quick peek at your system power settings.

Understanding Icons, Folders, 
and Windows
You’ve already been introduced to icons, the cutesy pictures that miracu-
lously cause things to happen when you double-click them. That you need
not give a moment’s thought to the heavy machinations taking place under
the hood after you click an icon is the beauty of graphical computing.
Try double-clicking the icon labeled Macintosh HD. It stands for hard drive
and appears (by default) near the upper-right corner of the desktop. A
window containing more icons appears. These represent the various software
applications loaded on your hard drive, plus folders stuffed with files and
documents.
Now try this one out for size. Double-click the Users folder. See whether you
can locate your home folder. Giveaway hint: It’s the one with a picture of a
house and your name. Double-click the home folder, and yet another window
jumps to the forefront. It contains subfolders for the documents you have cre-
ated, plus movies, music, and pictures.
You can double-click under Users to see home folders for other people with
user accounts on your system. But the tiny red circles with a white line
through them tell you that the contents of these respective subfolders are
private or restricted. I call the little red circles Back off, Bud symbols. If you
do boldly click a BoB, you will be gently scolded with a note that says “you
do not have sufficient access privileges.”
Windows dressing
The mere mention of windows may make some of you skittish. It might con-
jure up thoughts about a certain vision of computing propagated by that
really rich fellow hanging out in the Seattle outskirts. But I’m not speaking of
Microsoft or Bill Gates. The windows under discussion here start with a low-
ercase “dubya.”
There’s nothing small about these windows’ capabilities. Just as opening win-
dows in your house can let in fresh air, opening and closing Mac windows can
do so too, at least metaphorically.
Of course, the windows on the Mac can do a heck of a lot more than your typ-
ical windows at home, unless you live with Willy Wonka. These windows can
be stretched, dragged to a new locale on the desktop, and laid one on top of
another.
34
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

To help you understand these windows, check out Figure 3-3.
A stunning view
The Mac graciously lets you peek at information from three main perspec-
tives. Open the View menu in the menu bar and choose As icons, As list, or
As columns. Alternatively, click the appropriate button, as shown in Figure
3-4. Let’s zoom in for a close-up of these views.
Close — Click the cute red gumdrop button to close the window
Minimize — Click the yellow circle to send the window into hiding

By icon
In the example in Figure 3-4, we explored the home folder window through
what’s known as the icon view because the windows are populated by those
pretty little pictures. You know the Music subfolder by its icon of a musical
note. And you know the Movies subfolder by the small picture of a movie
clapper.
If you are in a playful mood (or have nothing better to do), you can change
the size of the icons by choosing View➪Show View and moving the Icon size
slider from left to right.
By accessing View Options under the View menu, you can alter the position
of an icon label (by clicking the Bottom or Right radio button). You can
change the color of the window background or use one of your own images
as the background. You can also arrange the order of icons by the date they
were modified, the date they were created, size, kind, or label.
By list
Look on the View menu, and note the check mark next to As Icons. Now click the
As List item, and the check mark moves there. The icons shrink dramatically, and

the subfolders in the home folder appear, well, as a list. Thus, you are living in
List view land, shown in Figure 3-5. A lot more info is displayed in this view,
including the date and time a file was modified, its size, and the type of file (such
as application or folder). And by clicking a column heading, you can sort the list
anyway you see fit, without having to choose View➪Arrange By, which is the
method for sorting in Icon view.
Suppose you’re looking for a file in your Documents folder. You can’t remem-
ber the name of the file, but you can remember the month and day you
worked on it. Click the Date Modified heading, and subfolders and files are
now listed chronically, oldest or newest first, depending on the direction of
the tiny triangle next to the heading. Click the Date Modified heading again to
change the order from most recent to oldest or vice versa.
If size matters (and doesn’t it always?), click the Size heading to display the
list from the biggest file size to the smallest or smallest to biggest. Again,
clicking the little triangle changes the order.
If you would rather organize the list by type of file (such as text or folder),
click the Kind column heading to clump together like-minded entries.
While in list view, you may notice right-pointing triangles next to some of the
names. This tells you that a particular listing contains subfolders or files. To
see what they are, click the triangle. The little symbol points in a downward
direction, and any subfolders and files associated with the original folder are
now revealed, in some cases with a little triangle of their own.

Chapter 3: Getting to the Core of the Apple 

Sometimes you can’t see all the headings because the window isn’t large
enough. You have a few options. Drag a column heading to the right or left to
reorder the columns so the one you want to see appears. You can drag the
slider bar at the bottom of the screen to view headings without rearranging
the order. Or grab the handle at the bottom-right corner of the window to
increase the size of the entire window.
By columns
Next, choose View➪As Columns. Again, the check mark moves, altering your
perspective. Several vertical panes appear inside one large window. These
smaller windows within windows show a progression. At the far left is a pane
called the sidebar, a regular hangout for your network, hard disk, home
folder, applications, documents, movies, and more. The sidebar appears in
the same place in every Finder window.
Now suppose that the home folder is highlighted in the sidebar. The pane to
its immediate right displays its contents. Highlight an item in that pane, and
the folder to its immediate right reveals its contents. Each time you highlight
an entry in a particular pane, a new pane appears to its right.
Again, you can resize a column pane by dragging the handle at the bottom of
the pane, as shown in Figure 3-6. To resize all the columns simultaneously,
press the Option key while dragging. You can expand the entire window by
dragging its handle at the bottom right.

What’s Up, Dock?
Your eyes can’t help but be drawn to the colorful bar at the bottom of the
screen (see Figure 3-7). This is your dock, and it may comfort those familiar
with Microsoft’s way of designing a computer interface to think of the dock as
a rough cross between the Windows taskbar and the Start menu. In my
humble opinion, it’s more attractive than the Windows taskbar. More fun too.
Try single-clicking an icon in the dock. The little picture bobs up and down
like a school kid desperate to get the teacher’s attention so he can safely
make it to the bathroom.
Mouse over an icon and its name appears
A triangle indicates a program is open
To remove an icon, drag it off the dock
39
Chapter 3: Getting to the Core of the Apple 
Figure 3-7:
Docking
your icons.

What you’ll find on the dock
The dock is divided by a thin black line into two parts. To the left of the line
are programs. To the right are any open files and folders, plus the trash can.
Keep in mind that the mere act of single-clicking a dock icon launches a pro-
gram or other activity. In most other places on a Mac, you have to double-
click an icon to make it get off its derrière.
If a tiny up-pointing triangle appears below a dock icon, that means the pro-
gram is open. When you mouse over a dock icon, the title of the appropriate
application appears.
On newer Macs, the following icons appear by default on the left side of the
dock:
 Finder: With a goofy face on top of a square, the Finder icon looks like it
belongs in a SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon. Single-clicking here brings
up the main Finder window.
 Dashboard: The round gauge is the front end for clever little applica-
tions called widgets (see Chapters 6 and 21 for more information).
 Safari: The Mac’s fine Web browser (Chapter 9).
 Mail: Yes, Apple has a built-in e-mail program (Chapter 10).
 iChat: Part instant messenger, part audio and video chat program
(Chapter 11).
 Address book: The place for phone numbers and e-mail addresses
(more later in the chapter).
 iTunes: Apple’s renowned musical jukebox (Chapter 14).
 iPhoto: The shoebox for storing and touching up digital images 
(Chapter 15).
 iMovie HD: The place to edit videos (Chapter 16).
 iCal: A built-in calendar (more later in this chapter).
 QuickTime Player: Multimedia audio/video player (later in this chapter).
 System Preferences: Having it your way (Chapter 5).
 GarageBand: This is where you can launch your musical career
(Chapter 17).
 iWeb: Lets you creating personal Web sites, blogs, and podcasts
(Chapter 12).
 iDVD: Burn movies onto a disk (Chapter 16).
40
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

And these appear on the right bank:
 Apple — Mac OS X: Clicking here launches Safari to take you to the OS X
portion of Apple’s Web site.
 Trash: Hey, even computer garbage has to go somewhere (Chapter 7).
Loading up the dock
Adding favorite items to the dock is as simple as dragging and dropping them
there. Of course, the more icons that get dropped in the dock, the more con-
gested the joint gets. Even icons deserve breathing room. To remove items, just
drag them outside the dock. The icon disappears behind a little white cloud.
Here’s another neat stunt:
1. Open the Apple menu.
2. Choose Dock➪Turn Magnification On.
Now as your cursor runs over the icons, the little pictures blow up like
bubble gum.
If you’re into resizing dock icons, choose Dock➪Dock Preferences. Make sure
the Magnification box is selected and drag the Magnification slider from left
(Min) to right (Max) depending upon your fancy. A separate slider lets you
alter the dock size.
Docking the dock
The very first time you notice the dock, it appears at the bottom of your
screen. Apple doesn’t make you keep it there. The dock can move to the left or
right flank of the screen, depending, I suppose, on your political persuasion.
Again, choose the Dock command from the Ú menu. Choose either Position
on Left or Position on Right. Pardon the pun, but your dock is now dockside.
If you find that the dock is getting in the way no matter where you put it, you
can make it disappear altogether, at least until you need it again. Choose Ú➪
Dock➪Turn Hiding On.
When Hiding is On, drag the cursor to the bottom (or sides) of the screen
where the dock would have otherwise been visible. It magically glides into
view. The dock retreats to its cave when you glide the cursor away. If you find
you miss the dock after all, repeat the earlier steps, but now choose Turn
Hiding Off.
41
Chapter 3: Getting to the Core of the Apple 

A minimizing effect
The dock isn’t the only thing you’d like to nudge out of the way from time to
time. Sometimes entire windows take up too much screen real estate or cover
up other windows you want to see. You can close the objectionable window
altogether, but that is sometimes a Draconian maneuver, especially if you
intend to work in the window again a moment or so later.
You can minimize the window instead. Move the mouse to the upper-left
corner of your open window and find the tiny yellow droplet flanked by tiny
red and green droplets. (That is, they are red, yellow, and green by default.)
I’d show you a picture, but this book is in black-and-white. I’d say leave it to
your imagination, but something tells me you’re already familiar with this
red, yellow, and green idea. In any case, if you single-click the yellow circle in
the upper-left corner of a window, the entire thing shrivels up and lands
safely on the right side of the dock (assuming you’ve stuck with Minimize
using Genie Effect inside Dock preferences).
To restore the window to its full and (presumably) upright position, single-
click its newly created dock icon.
Be careful not to click the tiny red circle instead. That closes the window
instead of minimizing it.
Clicking the green circle maximizes the window to its full potential.
If one of the circles appears with no color, it means that particular function is
currently unavailable.
Quitting time
It’s 5 p.m. (or in my world, hours later), so it’s quitting time. Here’s how to
punch out of a specific application. Just to the right of the Ú menu, you see
the name of the program you’re currently working in. Suppose it’s Safari.
Single-click the Safari name and choose Quit Safari from the drop-down menu.
Or if you had been working in, say, Word, you’d choose Quit Word from the
drop-down menu.
Here’s a quickie keyboard alternative: Press Ô+Q and choose the program
you’re in from the drop-down menu.

A Gaggle of Freebie Programs
A major fringe benefit of Mac ownership is all the nifty software you get
gratis. Many of these freebie programs, notably those that are part of iLife,
are such a big deal that they deserve entire chapters onto themselves.
In this section, I discuss programs of smaller stature. I’m not demeaning
them; in fact, a number of these bundled programs are quite handy to have
around.
You’ll find some of the programs I am about to mention in the dock. But
another good place to look is the Applications folder, which is accessible in
three ways:
 Click Applications in the sidebar.
 Choose Go➪Applications.
 Press the keyboard shortcut Shift+Ô+A.
Staying organized
Not all of us have the luxury of hiring a secretary or assistant to keep our life
in some semblance of order or to just provide a jolt of caffeine when we need
it. I sure don’t (sigh).
Regrettably, a Mac still can’t make coffee. (Although I wouldn’t bet against
the ultrasecretive programmers inside Apple figuring out how to brew a cup
inside the machine.) But it is reassuring that the computer can simplify other
administrative chores. Check out the applications in this section:
Address Book
You just met an attractive stranger on the way to the Apple store? The
Address Book, accessed through the Applications folder or by clicking its
dock icon, is a handy repository for addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail
address. You can also add a picture and note about the person (“awfully cute;
owns a Mac”).
After opening the program, here’s how to add an address book entry:
1. Under the column marked Name, click the + sign (shown if Figure 3-8).
You can alternatively open the Address Book and choose File➪New
Card.
43
Chapter 3: Getting to the Core of the Apple 

2. Type the person’s first and last names, company, phone number, and
other information in their appropriate fields.
Press the tab key to move from one field to the next. You can skip fields
if you don’t have information and add others as need be. For example, to
add space for a new mobile phone number entry, click the + next to the
field name.
3. Close the Address Book.
If someone sends you a virtual address card (known as a vCard), just drag it
into the Address Book window. If you already have an entry for the person,
you’ll have the option to blend the new data with the old.
As you might imagine, Address Book has close ties to a bunch of other Mac
applications that I discuss later in this book, most notably Mail and iChat.
Creating Smart Groups
Now suppose a whole bunch of people in your Address Book have something
in common. Maybe you all play softball on weekends. (That’s a good thing.
Break away. Have fun. Limber up. Your computer will be waiting for you when
you get back.) A Smart Group is a terrific way to manage information in
Address Book on all your teammates.
Figure 3-8:
Adding an
entry in the
Address
Book.
44
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

The key is to add a descriptive word that lumps you all together in the Notes
field. Something, like, voila, softball. So whenever a new contact comes along
and you type in the word “softball,” he or she will become part of your Smart
Group.
To create a Smart Group from scratch, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New Smart Group.
2. In the Smart Group Name field, type a name for your group.
I typed Weekend Athletes.
3. Click the + and specify the group criteria using drop-down menus, as
shown in Figure 3-9.
4. If you want to know when a new slugger has been added to the roster,
make sure the Highlight Group When Updated Option is selected.
iCal
It’s swell that all your friends want to join the team. But good luck figuring
out a time when everybody can play.
For assistance, consult the Mac’s personal calendar application, iCal. It lets
you share your calendar with people on the same computer or “publish” a
calendar over the Internet to share with others, perhaps by subscribing to
.Mac. (pronounced “dot Mac”), to which I devote Chapter 12.
iCal also lets you subscribe to public calendars over the Internet (sports
teams, movie openings, and so on). As you might imagine, it can also show
the birthday of folks residing in your Address Book.
iSync
Many of you use more than one computer (you should be so lucky if you
have more than one Mac). You probably also have a cell phone, a personal
Figure 3-9:
Creating a
Smart
Group.
45
Chapter 3: Getting to the Core of the Apple 

digital assistant (PDA), and an iPod. Through iSync, you can keep your calen-
dar, Address Book, and Internet bookmarks synchronized across multiple
devices. If you change an e-mail address on your cell phone, you can connect
the device to the Mac (even wirelessly through technology known as
Bluetooth) and have the number automatically updated in the computer’s
Address Book.
Stickies
Walk around your office and I’ll lay odds that at least some of your colleagues
have yellow Post-it notes attached to their computer monitors. You too, huh?
They’re a great way to make your supervisor think you’re really busy.
The Mac provides an electronic version called Stickies. Just like the gluey
paper kind, electronic notes let you jot down those quickie shopping lists,
phone numbers, and To-Dos.
But virtual Stickies have it all over their paper counterparts. Consider these
stunts:
 You can resize Stickies by dragging the handle on the note’s lower-right
corner.
 You can import text or graphics, and alter fonts and font sizes.
 You can check the spelling of words in the note.
 You can create translucent Stickies to see what’s behind them.
 You can delete a note without crumpling it or crossing out its contents.
 You won’t clutter up your good-looking Macintosh computer. (You will
have to concoct another scheme to convince your boss how hard you
are working.)
Creating a new Stickie doesn’t count as work. After opening the app, choose
File➪New Note. Then start scribbling, um, typing away.
Tooling around for a reference
A lot of what people do on a computer is look things up, mainly through
Internet search engines (Chapter 9) and other online tools (Chapter 11).
There’s help closer at hand — in the Applications Folder.
46
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

Dictionary
Finding the meaning of words or phrases is as simple as typing them in a
search box. Finding the meaning of life is something else altogether. The Mac
supplies versions of the New Oxford American Dictionary and Oxford American
Writer’s Thesaurus. The computer can even read a dictionary entry out loud.
TextEdit
TextEdit is a freebie word processor. Although it offers nowhere near the flex-
ibility of an industrial-strength word processor such as Microsoft Word
(Chapter 7), it’s no slouch either. You can create tables and lists, and apply a
bunch of formatting tricks. And it can accommodate Word documents (if
someone sends you one). Truth is, most Word users exploit only a narrow
subset of features anyway. I’m not urging you to steer clear of Word. Just
know that you already have a decent little word processor onboard.
Calculator
Hey if all of us could do math in our heads, we wouldn’t need a calculator. In
fact, the Mac supplies three on-screen calculators: Basic, Scientific, and
Programmer. Choose the one you need from the calculator’s View menu.
The Basic calculator is for people like me who find the need to perform
simple arithmetic here and there. You can use the numeric keypad on your
keyboard or use the mouse to click the calculator’s keypad.
The Scientific version adds square root, sin, cos, and other keys whose mere
thought causes me to break out in hives. (Don’t count on seeing me as a
future author of Math For Dummies.)
The Programmer calculator is even more intimidating. It has keys labeled
Hide Binary, Byte Flip, Unicode, RoL, and RoR. You earn extra credit if you
know what all these do.
The Mac calculator is capable of tricks that blow away even the fanciest
pocket calculator, such as going online to fetch the latest currency exchange
rates.
QuickTime in the nick of time
QuickTime, the Mac’s free multimedia player comes to the rescue when you
want to watch a movie (but not a DVD), play sounds, or display pictures.
QuickTime typically pops up as needed.
47
Chapter 3: Getting to the Core of the Apple 

If you want to edit movies or have other bold ambitions (that is, full-screen
playback), consider springing for a $30 version of the program called
QuickTime Pro.
Previewing Preview
Preview is a versatile program that lets you view graphics files, faxes, take
screen shots or screen captures, and peek at PDFs. (That’s shorthand for
Adobe’s portable document format.) It typically loads automatically as
needed. For example, if you double-click a PDF file someone sent you,
Preview is probably the program that lets you read it. You can use Preview to
rotate, resize, and crop images in one of the many file types it recognizes.

 You already own a Mac and are looking to add a second or even third

Regrettably, I can’t help anyone in the third group. Feel free to tag along
anyway. Hey, you might want to hear about how all these Macs are getting
brain transplants.

Intel’s Inside?
The computer industry creates strange bedfellows sometimes, maybe none
stranger than the apparently blissful union between Apple and Intel. To vet-
eran Mac diehards, placing Intel processors (or chips) inside their beloved
computers is a scandal analogous to an intimate liaison between George
Jetson and Wilma Flintstone.
Intel was the enemy, after all. Its processors belonged inside Windows com-
puters, not Apple’s, hence the derided (from a Mac point of view) moniker
Win-tel. Suffice to say, Apple’s head honcho Steve Jobs blew a few minds
when he broke the news that the company was jilting long-fancied PowerPC
G4 and G5 processors produced by IBM and going with chips made by Intel.
Apple announced it would overhaul its entire hardware lineup with Intel
chips throughout 2006, a process well underway as this book went to press.
So what is a processor anyway? Put simply, it is the brains behind your 
computer.
Two chips are better than one
Most Macs reborn with Intel processors actually have two chips engineered
on a single slab of silicon. These Core Duo chips, as they are known, boast
twice the computational horsepower of a more traditional single chip design.
The idea is that the two chips can team up and share resources as needed
but also conserve power if one of the Cores is not needed for a particular
function.
But are you giving up something 
to get something?
The burning issue for Mac loyalists is whether the presence of Intel would
somehow mess things up. For the most part, the answer is a resounding no.
Intel-based machines still look like Macs, quack like Macs and behave like
Macs. I explain the exceptions in the “Leave it to Rosetta” sidebar.

Big Mac or Little Mac? The Laptop
versus Desktop Decision
Desktop? Laptop? Or notebook? Okay, that was a bit of a trick question
because people use notebook and laptop to refer to the same thing. So it’s
really desktop versus laptop/notebook.
The choice comes down to lifestyle, economics, and what you do for a living.
If you burn lots of frequent-flier miles, chances are you’ll gravitate to a laptop.
If you tend to be home- or office-bound, a desktop might be more suitable.
Because you’re getting a Mac whichever way you go, take solace in the fact
that the system comes preloaded with the OS X Tiger operating system and
other software goodies I expound on in other chapters.
Let’s give each side their due. The typical trade-offs follow. Here are the rea-
sons for buying a Mac desktop:
 You generally get more computing bang for the buck.
 Larger hard drives.
51
Chapter 4: Here a Mac, There a Mac, Everywhere a Mac Mac
Leave it to Rosetta
To help you deal with the Mac’s brain transplant,
Apple and its industry pals started designing so-
called Universal software applications. These
programs are meant to run natively on both
G4/G5 machines and Intel-based Macs. In other
words, they rock either place. You know you’ve
bought a Universal application because the box
carries the logo shown here. Not surprisingly, the
iLife software already loaded on your computer
also receives the Universal seal of approval.
But what about older software you may have
lying around? Will those programs make nice
with Intel? Most will, thanks to behind-the-
scenes technology known as Rosetta. (I will
resist a joke about Apple leaving no stone
unturned.) You don’t have to actively mouse
around to wake up Rosetta. Quietly and invisi-
bly, it does its thing, which basically involves
translating software code to ensure that (for
now) non-Universal programs such as
Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop will
work, if not up to their maximum potential.
Ancient programs won’t work at all on “Mac-
tel” machines. These include the Classic apps
that predate OS X.
Universal

 Bigger displays.
 Extra jacks and connectors.
 Easier to upgrade.
 You won’t slow anyone down checking in at airport security.
 The machine looks cool in your home or office.
And here’s why you would want to buy a Mac laptop:
 Light and portable.
 Appealing if you work or live in cramped quarters.
 Runs off battery or AC power.
 You can impress your seatmate on an airplane.
If a Desktop Is Your Poison
In most instances, buying an Apple desktop computer does not mean you
have to start rearranging or buying new furniture. Sure Mac desktops gener-
ally take up more space than Mac notebooks. But the machines are no larger
than they have to be, and in some cases are so good-looking you want to
show them off anyway.
iMac
As shown in Figure 4-1, the iMac is the most elegantly designed desktop com-
puter on the planet.
Now that I’ve said that, let me mention a proviso: The iMac is the most ele-
gantly designed desktop computer on the day that I write this. Apple wouldn’t
be Apple without surprises. By the time this book gets to you, the gang inside
the company’s Cupertino, California, headquarters may well have one-upped
themselves. (I’m not ready to predict that anybody outside Cupertino will
come up with a bolder design than Jobs & Co.)
Now that that lawyerly comment is out of the way, back to the captivating
charmer at hand. The innards of the system — Intel Core Duo processor,
memory, hard drive, CD/DVD player, and more — are concealed inside a 
2-inch-thin flat-screen monitor. You can’t help wonder where the rest of the
computer is, especially if you’re accustomed to seeing a more traditional
tower-type PC design.
52
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech

When you place a CD or DVD in the slot on the iMac’s right side, the disc gets
sucked inside the machine like a dollar in a vending machine’s bill changer.
The small square peephole at the top of the monitor covers up a built-in
iSight video camera (I bring up possible uses in Chapters 5 and 11). The com-
puter also comes with a Bic-lighter–sized Apple remote used to control
music, videos, and other media through Apple’s slick alternative full-screen
Front Row software interface, for launching the music, photos, DVDs, and
videos that reside on your Mac, especially when you’re not quite sitting on
top of the computer.
Mac Mini
Is the Mac Mini shown in Figure 4-2 really a desktop? After all, Mac Mini is
easily mistaken for a bread box or coaster on steroids. But the petite 2-inch
tall, 6.5-inch square aluminum contraption is indeed Apple’s crazy (and cozy)
notion of what a budget desktop computer is all about. At less than 3 pounds,
Mac Mini is portable, but not in the same sense as a notebook you would fly
with cross-country. (Carting this computer from room to room is more like it.)

Models start at just $599, but keep in mind that this is a BYOB computer — as
in bring your own keyboard, mouse, and monitor. (The assumption is that you
have these already, but if not, Apple will happily sell them to you.) Hey, at least
the Apple remote is supplied. Given its size and price, Mac Mini might make an
ideal second or third computer and is a perfect dorm room companion.
Because Mac Mini has Front Row and a collection of video connectors, you
can also hook it up to a big screen TV or take advantage of a superior speaker
system. And Mini includes the smarts to play back music or videos stored on
other computers in your house, including Windows systems.
Mac Pro
I don’t really expect many readers of this book to run out and buy the Mac
Pro. It may seem tempting to own the machine Apple billed as the “fastest
Mac ever” when it was introduced in August 2006. But there’s a reason the
word Pro is included in the name of this desktop machine — it’s not a com-
puter aimed at the masses. Instead, this machine is intended for profession-
als facing demanding graphics and other computing tasks. The computer is
noteworthy for another reason: Its arrival completed the transition of the
Mac line to Intel processors. 
A standard Mac Pro configuration fetches $2499 and includes two 2.66 GHz
Dual-Core Intel Xeon processors, plus a 250GB hard drive. But this Mac is
meant to be the ultimate built-to-order computer. Apple says there are up to
4.9 million possible configurations, and you can build a Mac Pro that costs
well north of $10,000.
Going Mobile
You don’t have to be a traditional road warrior to crave a notebook these days.
You might just need something to schlep from lecture hall to lecture hall, your
home to your office, or maybe just from the basement to the bedroom.

In choosing any laptop, take into account its traveling weight. Besides the
weight of the machine itself, consider the heft of the AC power cord and pos-
sibly a spare battery. None of the Mac laptops are killers as far as weight is
concerned, but some are lighter than others.
One of the first decisions you have to make is how big a screen you want.
Bigger displays are nice, of course, but they weigh and cost more. And you
may be sacrificing some battery life. Hmm, are you getting the sense that this
battery business is a big deal? It can be, which is why I offer tips on how to
stay juiced, at the end of the chapter.
As part of its migration to Intel processors, Apple retired two longtime mem-
bers of its laptop lineup in 2006, the ivory white iBook (popular with stu-
dents) and the silver PowerBook. Here’s a brief look at their Intel-inside
replacements, the MacBook and MacBook Pro.
MacBook Pro
The successor to the PowerBook is MacBook Pro, shown in Figure 4-3. It will
set you back $1999 or more. MacBook Pro resembles the PowerBook on the
outside, but it’s a lot different on the inside. That’s because it’s the first of the
Mac-tel notebooks. The inch-thin machine runs Core Duo processors. It has a
brighter (15.4-inch) screen than its predecessors, plus one of those incon-
spicuous iSight cameras. (There’s also a $2799 17-inch model.) MacBook Pros
also come with the Apple remote and Front Row.

Chapter 4: Here a Mac, There a Mac, Everywhere a Mac Mac

MacBook Pro did relinquish some features found on PowerBooks, such as
fewer ports and connectors. The absence of a standard dialup modem for
connecting to the Internet in hotels and elsewhere is an annoying and silly
omission. You can purchase an external modem that will connect to one of
the computer’s USB ports for $50.
Apple also replaced a standard PC Card–type slot for adding such things as
memory card readers and cellular modems with a new-generation slot called
ExpressCard. Many of those type cards are still being developed.
On the plus side, ambient sensors can illuminate the keyboard when the
cabin lights are dimmed on an airplane. If that doesn’t create a mood and
show the cute passenger in 12C how resourceful you are, nothing will.
Meanwhile, if you drop the machine, and trust me it happens, built-in sensors
instantly park the hard drive to reduce the damage.
The next neat feature, called MagSafe, may not win brownie points with
strangers on a plane. But it just might earn you raves at home. To find out
about it, see the “Cord tripping” sidebar.

Cord tripping
Has your dog or kid ever come barreling into a
room and tripped over the power cord connected
to your laptop? The machine goes flying off your
desk, and you scramble to assess the damage.
Have you no shame? Tend to your kid first.
Apple had this scenario in mind when it
designed the MagSafe connector, a nifty inno-
vation that debuted on the MacBook Pro.
Instead of physically inserting the power cord
to a connector as on previous Mac laptops, you
adhere the MagSafe magnetically.
So the next time your adolescents (canine or
human) come running in and trip the wire, the
cord should easily yank free, presumably with-
out harming the Mac or your first born. One
downside: The power brick in the middle of the
new cord is bulkier than cords used on previous
models.

MacBook
Despite a lower price — they start at $1099 for a white model and $1499 for a
version in black — the MacBook shares some of the features of its Pro cousin,
including the built-in iSight camera, Front Row, the Apple remote, and
MagSafe. The main difference is the 5.2-pound nearly inch-thick MacBook has
a smaller (13.3-inch wide) screen and not quite the robust graphics capabili-
ties for running high-end photography programs such as Aperture. As with
the iBook it supplants, it should find a home on college campuses.
Taming the Trackpad
In Chapter 2, I introduce the trackpad, the smooth rectangular finger-licking
surface below the keyboard that’s your laptop’s answer to using a mouse.
You can still use a regular mouse with a laptop, of course, and may prefer to
do so if you’re sitting at your regular desk. If you’re sitting in coach instead,
the mouse is an unwelcome companion, critter, especially to the passenger
sitting next to you. Don’t be surprised if he or she calls an exterminator (or at
least the flight attendant).
A trackpad (and the human beings who control it) has its own annoying idio-
syncrasies. It may refuse to cooperate if you touch it coming out of the
shower. Hand-lotions are also a no-no. A trackpad loathes moisture and
humidity. If it does get wet, gently wipe it with a clean cloth. Do not use any
kind of household cleaning solution.
The best place to train a trackpad is in Keyboard and Mouse preferences.
Choose Ú➪System Preferences. Under Keyboard and Mouse preferences,
click Trackpad. The window in Figure 4-4 appears.
Here are some of the things you can do:
 Drag the Tracking Speed slider to change how fast the pointer moves
and the Double-Click Speed slider to set how fast you have to double-
click.
 If you want to click by tapping the trackpad surface, without having to
press the trackpad button, select the Clicking option.
 You can drag an item by tapping it twice, without having to hold down
the button, by selecting the Dragging option.
 Using two fingers on the trackpad surface will not move the cursor when
you select the Ignore accidental trackpad input option.
57
Chapter 4: Here a Mac, There a Mac, Everywhere a Mac Mac

 If you plan on using a regular mouse, select the Ignore trackpad when
mouse is present option.
 Two-finger scrolling is a recent trackpad function not included on older
models.
Keeping Your Notebook Juiced
Sooner or later, especially if Murphy (the fellow behind that nasty Law) has
any say in the manner, your battery will lose its charge. At precisely the
worst possible moment. Like when your professor is prepping you for a final
exam. Or you are about to discover whodunit while watching a DVD on an
overseas flight. I hasten to point out that watching a movie will drain your
battery a lot quicker than working on a spreadsheet.
A tiny gauge on the menu bar, as shown in Figure 4-5, gives you a decent mea-
surement of how long you can work before your battery peters out. You can
display this gauge by time or percentage. Just click the menu bar icon,
choose Show, and then choose Icon Only, Time, or Percentage.
The battery life cited by manufacturers has a lot in common with the miles
per gallon estimates quoted by automakers. Your actual battery life will vary,
Figure 4-4:
The key to
taming your
trackpad.
58
Part I: Freshman Year at Drag-and-Drop Tech 

depending on how you drive your computer. Expect the total to be less than
the manufacturer’s claim.
You may routinely keep the computer plugged to recharge the battery. Still,
Apple recommends pulling the plug periodically to keep the juices flowing. If
you don’t plan on using the computer for six months or more (and why the
heck not?), remove the battery and store it with about a 50% charge. You may
not be able to resuscitate a fully discharged battery that has been kept on the
sidelines too long.
Rechargeable batteries have a finite number of charging cycles, so even with
the best feed and caring they have to be replaced eventually. It is quite evi-
dent when it’s time to put the battery out to pasture because it will no longer
hold a charge. Remember to give it an environmentally correct burial.
Don’t give up the fight just yet. You can take steps to boost your battery’s
longevity. Your computer is smart about conservation. When plugged in, it
feels free to let loose. That means the hard drive will spin around to its heart’s
content, and the display can be turned up to maximum brightness settings.
You can tell a Mac how to behave when it is unplugged:
 Dim the screen. There’s nothing your laptop battery likes better than
mood lighting. Press F1 on the keyboard to turn down the brightness.
 Open Energy Saver (see Figure 4-6) by single-clicking the battery gauge in
the menu bar and then selecting Open Energy Saver. Alternatively,
choose Ú➪System Preferences, and double-click Energy Saver. Near the
top of the window, choose Better Battery Life from the Optimization list.
You will notice other options in Energy Saver, including a slider to put
the computer to sleep when it’s not used for a certain period, plus a
slider to put the display asleep after the machine is inactive. Make sure
the option to Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible is checked.

 Shut down the AirPort wireless networking feature (Chapter 18) if you
are not surfing the Internet. AirPort hogs power. And you shouldn’t be
using it anyway if you’re traveling on an airplane.
 Likewise, turn off the wireless settings for Bluetooth if you’re on a plane
or if you just want to save some juice.
After all, given all your aspirations with your computer, the last thing you
want to have happen is to run out of power.

sn’t it about time to do some honest-to-goodness 
computing? Roll up your sleeves. You’re about to per-

 Logging in and off
 Choosing a desktop picture and screen saver
 Exposing Exposé
 Setting priorities
You adore your family and friends to death, but you have to admit that
they can get under your skin from time to time. They know how to push
your buttons, and you sure know how to push theirs. People are fussy about
certain things, and that includes you (and me).
So it goes with your Macintosh. The presumption is that you and your Mac
are going to cohabit well into the future. Still, it can’t hurt to get off on the
right foot and set up the machine so that it matches your personal prefer-
ences and expectations, and not some programmer’s at Apple. No two Macs
ever end up the same. The software you load on your system differs from the
programs your best buddies install on their computers. You tolerate dozens
of icons on the Mac desktop, they prefer a less cluttered screen. You choose
a blown-up picture of Homer Simpson for your desktop background; your
pals go with a screen-size poster of Jessica Simpson.
Establishing User Accounts
As much as the computer staring you in the face is your very own Mac,
chances are you’ll be sharing it with someone else: your spouse and kids,
perhaps, if not your students and co-workers. I know you generously thought

about buying each of them a computer. But then your little one needs braces,
you’ve been eyeing a new set of golf clubs and, the truth is, your largesse has
limits. So you’ll be sharing the computer, all right, at least for awhile. The
challenge now is avoiding chaos and all-out civil war.
The Mac helps keep the peace by giving everyone their own user accounts,
which are separate areas to hang out in that are password protected to pre-
vent intrusions. (There’s not much the folks at Apple can do to avert fights
over when people use the computer.)
In Chapter 2, I explain how you create your own user account as part of the ini-
tial computer setup. Not all user accounts are created equal, and yours is extra
special. That’s because as the owner of the machine, you’re the head honcho,
the Big Cheese, or in the bureaucracy of your computer, the administrator.
Being the Big Cheese doesn’t earn you an expense account or a plush corner
office with a view of the lakefront. It does, however, carry executive privi-
leges. You get to lord over not only who else can use the machine but who, if
anyone, gets the same administrative rights you have.
Think long and hard before you grant anyone else these dictatorial powers.
Only an administrator can install new programs in the Applications folder,
choose which files to share among all users, or muck around with such
system settings such as Date & Time and Energy Saver. And only an adminis-
trator can effectively hire and fire, by creating or eliminating other user
accounts.
To create a new account for one of your coworkers, say, follow the steps
below:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences, and then click the Accounts icon.
Alternatively, click your user name on the upper-right corner of the
screen, mouse down to Accounts Preferences, and click. In both
instances, you end up in Accounts Preferences.
It’s worth remembering how you get to System Preferences because
you’ll be spending quite a bit of time there in this chapter. The Accounts
window that appears is shown in Figure 5-1.
2. If the Password tab isn’t highlighted, click it.
3. Click the + below the list of names on the right.
If the + appears dimmed, you have to click the padlock at the bottom of
the screen and enter your name and password to proceed. (You’ll
encounter this padlock throughout System Preferences and must click it
and enter an administrative password before being allowed to make
changes.)
64
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

4. Enter a name, a short name, a password, the password verification,
and (if you chose) a password hint.
This is the same drill you went through to create your own account.
Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, leave the Allow user to
administer this computer option unchecked. (Of course, you may want
to give a coworker or other person sharing an account the ability to
enter his or her own password and user name.)
5. Click the Picture tab.
6. Select the small image that will be displayed next to the user name
when the account holder logs on to the computer. (Again, you may
allow the other person to choose his or her own picture.)
You can click the bowling pins, gingerbread cookie, or other goofy iconic
images presented by Apple in the Accounts window. But account hold-
ers may well want to choose one of their own images. To do so, open OS
X’s default navigational window Finder (by clicking the Finder dock icon)
and then click Pictures. Drag an image into the little picture box next to
the word Edit in the Accounts window. Alternatively, click the Edit
button and then click Choose, which puts the user back in the Finder.
Check out the “Entering the photo booth” sidebar for another, more enjoy-
able way to create an account picture.

Chapter 5: Making the Mac Your Own

Using Parental Controls: When Father
(or Mother) Knows Best
Suppose one of the new accounts you create is for your impressionable off-
spring Cookie Monster. As a responsible parent, you want to set limits to
keep him out of trouble. And as a responsible Mac owner, you want to keep
him from unwittingly or (or otherwise) inflicting damage on the computer.
It’s time to apply parental controls. When you do so, Cookie’s account goes
from being a regular standard account to a managed account, with you as the
manager. You have quite a bit of say about what your youngster can and
cannot get away with.
In the Accounts window, highlight Cookie Monster’s name in the list on the
left. Then click the Parental Controls tab. The window shown in Figure 5-2
appears. Your choices are as follows:
 Mail: Specifies who your kid can exchange e-mail with. Click to select the
Mail option. A separate window opens. (If the option is already selected,
click Configure instead.) Click the Add (+) button in that window and
type an acceptable e-mail address. Separately enter your own e-mail
address in the “Send Permission Emails To” box at the bottom of the
window to approve any requests from Cookie Monster to correspond
with a person not already on the approved list.
 Finder & System: Provides various options for what Cookie Monster can
do on the computer. You find out more about these in a moment.
 iChat: Spells out who Cookie Monster can hold chats with through
instant messages.
 Safari: Requires you, the administrator, to log in as Cookie Monster and
launch the Safari Web browser (Chapter 9). You can then add the sites
you deem kosher for your little guy.
 Dictionary: Keeps Cookie Monster from looking up certain four-letter
words.
Now let’s explore Finder & System parental control options. Click the Configure
for Finder & System button, and the screen shown in Figure 5-3 appears. Select
the Some Limits option. Here’s where you get to decide whether Cookie
Monster will be able to administer printers, modify the dock, burn CDs and
DVDs, or open all System Preferences by selecting the corresponding check
boxes. You can also specify which applications he can open.

Entering the photo booth
Remember when you and your high school sweet-
heart slipped into one of those coin-operated
photo booths at the Five and Dime? Don’t worry,
I’m not telling what went on behind that curtain.
You probably confiscated the evidence years
ago, a strip with all those silly poses.
Silly poses are back in vogue. Apple is supplying
its own photo booth of sorts as a built-in soft-
ware feature on recent Macs with integrated
iSight cameras. You can produce an acceptable
account picture to use when exchanging
instant messages (Chapter 11).
The Apple Photo Booth and the photo booth of
yesteryear have some major differences. For
starters, you don’t have to surrender any loose
change. What’s more, there’s no curtain to hide
behind (which is kind of too bad), though there
is a picture of a curtain in the Photo Booth icon.
Still, Apple’s Photo Booth application is practi-
cally guaranteed to provide you hours of unbri-
dled pleasure thanks mostly to the warped
things you can do to doctor up images. You have
not lived until you’ve seen a picture of your face
morph into a light tunnel.
Open Photo Booth by clicking its name in the
Applications folder. Then, to snap an image,
merely click the Shutter button below the large
video screen that serves as a viewfinder, as
shown in the picture. A three-two-one count-
down ticks off. On zero, the display flashes, and
your mug is captured. You can apply funky spe-
cial effects to your visage either just before or
after snapping the picture. For instance, you can
make it look as if the picture was taken with a
thermal camera or an X-ray, or drawn with a col-
ored pencil. You can turn the image into pop art
worthy of Warhol or make it glow radioactively.
The pictures you take end up in an on-screen
photo strip. Click the thumbnail you want, and
decide what you want to do with the image by
choosing an appropriate button: Account
Picture, Buddy Picture (to make it your iChat
buddy icon), E-mail (to the Mac’s Mail applica-
tion), or iPhoto (to your picture library).

Now suppose that instead of Some Limits you selected Simple Finder. Under
this setting, Cookie can’t alter the dock and will see a sparse, icon-free desk-
top when he logs on.
You don’t have to have kids to implement parental controls. These controls
work nicely in setting limits on employees, friends, or visiting relatives.
The Lowdown on Logging On
You can create user accounts for any and all potential family members or visi-
tors who will be using this particular Mac. And you can control how they log
in. In this section I describe how.
In System Preferences, again choose Accounts Preferences, and then click
Login Options at the bottom of the left pane, under the list of all the account
holders on your system. If need be, click the padlock and enter a name and
administrative password. Once in, you’ll see the window shown in Figure 5-4.
Figure 5-4:
Choosing

options.
69
Chapter 5: Making the Mac Your Own

To automatically log in a particular user (likely yourself), select the
Automatically Log In As option and choose the appropriate person from the
pop-up menu. You’ll have to enter a password.
If the computer is set to automatically log you in, any user who restarts the
Mac in your absence will have access to your account.
If automatic log in is not turned on, users who start up the Mac will
encounter the computer’s Login screen. It will appear differently depending
on which radio button you chose under Display Login Window As under
Login Options.
Select List of Users to see a Login screen with a roster of people alongside
pictures for their respective accounts, plus a check mark if they’re already
logged in. As if that isn’t a clear enough marker, the words currently logged in
appear under the name.
Select Name and Password, and account holders must type a user name and
password in the appropriate boxes on the Login screen.
Either way, press Enter or click after entering the password to actually log in.
If you type the wrong password, the entire window wobbles as if having a
momentary seizure. Type it wrong a few more times, and any password hints
you previously entered appear (provided you chose that option under Login
Options).
And logging off
Say you are ready to call it quits for the day but don’t want to shut down the
machine. At the same time, you don’t want to leave your account open for
anyone with prying eyes. Baig’s Law: Just because your family, friends, and co-
workers are upstanding citizens doesn’t mean they won’t eavesdrop. The way to
shut down without really shutting down is to choose Ú➪Log Out.
Pulling a fast one
Now let’s consider another all-too-common scenario. You’re in the middle of
working when — how to put this delicately — last night’s pasta exacts
revenge. Nature calls As you get up to leave, your spouse comes running in,
“Honey, can I quickly check my e-mail?” You could log out to let her do so, but
because you are going to be right back, you figure there’s got to be a better
way. The better way is called fast user switching. To take advantage of the fea-
ture, you must have previously checked the box next to Enable Fast User
Switching, in the Login Options window.
70
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

Then, to let your spouse (or any other user) butt in, click your user name in
the upper-right corner of the screen. A list of all account holders appears.
The person can then click his or her name and type a password. Like a
revolving door, your entire desktop spins out of the way while the other
user’s desktop spins in. When you return moments later, you repeat this pro-
cedure by choosing your name and password. Your desktop twirls back into
view, right where you left off.
Letting Someone Go
Sometimes being the boss really does mean being the bad guy. The Mac
equivalent of terminating somebody is to delete the person’s user account
from the system. In the Accounts window, click the padlock (it’s at the
bottom right of the screen) to permit changes. Then select the name of the
person getting the pink slip. Click the – button under the list of names.
A dialog box presents two choices: Clicking OK wipes the account from the
system but saves the contents of the person’s home folder in a file appropri-
ately marked Deleted Users. You may want to retain some of his or her docu-
ments and files for your own records. If the user you’re booting was particularly
naughty (and you don’t need their files), you can choose Delete Immediately to
completely and instantly wipe out all traces of their existence.
Changing Appearances
Now that you’re past the unpleasant act of whacking someone from the
system, you can get back in touch with your kinder, gentler side. The part of
you solely occupied with making the Mac look pretty.
Altering the desktop
The surreal looking aqua-blue wallpaper Apple put up behind your desktop is
attractive enough. It’s just not necessarily your taste. You can rip it down and
start anew.
Choose Ú➪System Preferences. Click Desktop & Screen Saver, and make sure
the Desktop tab is highlighted, as shown in Figure 5-5. Click one of the design
categories in the list on the left (Apple Images, Nature, Plants, and so on).
Various design swatches appear on the right. Best of all, unlike the swatches
a salesperson might show you in a home decorating store, you can see what
a finished remodeling job here will look like. All you have to do is click.
71
Chapter 5: Making the Mac Your Own

The design categories on the left include a listing for the Pictures Folder as
well as folders from your iPhoto library (see Chapter 15). Clicking these
options lets you choose one of your own images for the desktop background.
Apple’s designer collection has nothing over masterpieces that include your
gorgeous child.
If variety is the spice of life — or you have a short attention span — click to
add a check mark to the Change picture every 30 minutes option (or select
another timeframe from the drop-down menu). Selecting the Random order
option will (you guessed it) change the background in random order. This
option cycles through pictures in the folder selected in the left pane.
Choosing a screen saver
“God save the screen. God save the screen? What’s that, wrong slogan? “Queen?
Oh, royal bummer, never mind.”
Screen savers are so-named because they were indeed created to save your
screen from a ghostly phenomenon known as burn-in. Whenever the same
fixed image was shown on a screen over long periods of time, a dim specter
from that image would be permanently etched onto the display. Burn-in
Figure 5-5:

ceased to be a problem long ago. But screen savers survived. Today their
value is strictly about cosmetics and personalization, in the same way you
might choose a vanity license plate or a ring tone for your cell phone.
In the Desktop & Screen Saver window, click the Screen Saver tab. (Not in
that window? Choose Ú➪System Preferences and then click Desktop &
Screen Saver.)
Click one of the screen savers in the box on the left side, as shown in Figure
5-6. Some of the pictures are truly stunning. (I recommend Cosmos or Nature
Patterns.) You can also select images from your own photo library or install
screen savers created by companies other than Apple.
You can preview screen savers in the small screen to the right or click the
Test button to get the full-screen impact.
After choosing a screen saver (or again having Apple choose one for you ran-
domly), drag the Start screen saver slider to tell the Mac to choose a time for
the screen saver to kick in, ranging from 3 minutes to 2 hours (or never).

Chapter 5: Making the Mac Your Own

Tidying Up with Exposé
You are so frantically busy that your papers end up strewn every which way,
empty coffee cups litter your desk, and boxes pile on top of boxes. Worse,
you can’t lay your hands on the precise thing you need the very moment
when you need it. Sound familiar? Psychiatrists have a technical name for
this kind of disorder. It is called being a slob. (Takes one to know one.)
Things can get untidy on the Mac desktop, too, especially as you juggle sev-
eral projects at once. At any given time, you may have opened System
Preferences, the dictionary, iCal, an e-mail program, numerous word process-
ing documents, and then some. Windows lay on top of windows. Chaos
abounds. You have fallen into the dark abyss that is multitasking.
Apple has the perfect tonic for MDLS (Messy Desktop Layered Syndrome).
The antidote is Exposé, and it is as close as your F9 key (or the Fn+F9 combi-
nation on some models).
Go ahead and press F9 now (or Fn + F9). Each previously open but obstructed
window emerges from its hiding place, like crooks finally willing to give them-
selves up after a lengthy standoff. All the windows are proportionately and
simultaneously downsized so that you can temporarily see them all at once,
as shown in Figure 5-7.
Now move the cursor over one of the visible windows. The title of the appli-
cation or folder is revealed, and the window appears dimmed. Point to the
window you want to bring to the front (to work on) and press the spacebar,
press Enter, or click inside the window.
Exposé is good for a few other stunts, and these are the default keys to make
them happen:
 F10: Opens all the windows in the application you’re currently using. If
you’re working on a document in Microsoft Word, for instance, any other
open documents in Word will also be brought to the front lines, as
shown in Figure 5-8.
 F11: Hides all windows so you can admire the stunning photograph you
chose for your desktop, as shown in Figure 5-9.

If you have something against F9, F10, and F11 (or are using those keys for
other purposes), open System Preferences, choose Dashboard & Exposé, and
assign alternative keys. And if you have something against keys in general,
you can arrange to have Exposé do its thing by moving the cursor to one of
the four corners of the screen.
Incidentally, if you’re wondering about the Dashboard part of Dashboard &
Exposé, skip ahead to the next chapter. Those who wait will be rewarded with
a tour of some of the remaining items in System Preferences.
System Preferences: Choosing Priorities
You may be wondering what’s left. We’ve already dug inside System
Preferences to alter the desktop and screensaver, establish parental controls,
muck around with Exposé, and then some. But as Figure 5-10 shows, there’s
still a lot more you can do. Let’s explore some of those options now.
Getting in sync with date and time
You established the date, time, and time zone when you set up the Mac ini-
tially (Chapter 2). In System Preferences, you can move the location of the
clock from the menu bar to a separate window. You can change the appear-
ance of the clock from a digital readout to an analog face with hands. You can
display the time with seconds or use a 24-hour clock. You can even have the
Mac announce the time on the hour, the half hour, or the quarter hour.

Chapter 5: Making the Mac Your Own

Displays
If you are hunky-dory with what your display looks like, feel free to ignore
this section. Read on if you are the least bit curious about resolution and what
changing it will do to your screen. Resolution is a measure of sharpness and
expressed by tiny picture elements, or pixels. Pixels is such a nice sounding
word that I always thought it would make a terrific name for a breakfast
cereal, something like new Kellogg’s Sugar-Coated Pixels. But I digress.
You will see resolution written out as 800 x 600, 1024 x 768, 1680 x 1050, and
so on. The first number refers to the number of pixels horizontally, and the
second number is the number of pixels vertically. Higher numbers reflect
higher resolution, meaning the picture is sharper and you can fit more on the
screen. At lower resolutions the images may be larger but fuzzier, though this
depends on your monitor. Lower resolutions also refresh, or update, more
quickly, though you will be hard-pressed to tell with most modern monitors.
As it happens, the refresh rate doesn’t mean boo on computers such as the
iMac with LCD or flat-panel displays.
You can also muck around with the number of colors that a Mac displays
(millions, thousands, or down to a puny 256). Best advice: Play around with
these settings if you must. More often than not, leave well enough alone.
Sound
Ever wonder what the Basso sound is? Or Sosumi or Tink? I’d play them for
you if this was an audio book, but because it isn’t, check out these and other
sound effects in System Preferences. You’ll hear one of them whenever the
Mac wants to issue an alert. Sound preferences is also the place to adjust
speaker balance, microphone settings, and pretty much anything else having
to do with what you’ll hear on the Mac.
Software update
Your Mac may be a machine, but it still has organic traits. And Apple hasn’t
forgotten about you just because you’ve already purchased one of its prized
computers. From time to time, the company will issue new releases of certain
programs to add new features it won’t make you pay for, to patch or fix bugs,
or to thwart security threats. For a full log, click Installed Updates.
78
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

You can have the Mac check for automatic software updates daily (might be
overkill), weekly, or monthly, or on the spot. If you choose, the Mac will fetch
important updates in the background, and bother you only when the pro-
gram update is ready to be installed. Software Update is accessible also
directly from the Ú menu.
Universal Access
Some physically challenged users may require special help controlling the
Mac. Choose Universal Access under System Preferences, and click the tab
you need assistance with: Seeing, Hearing, Keyboard, or Mouse, as shown in
Figure 5-11.
Among the options, you can arrange to
 Turn VoiceOver on or off, to hear descriptions of what’s on your screen.
 Enhance the contrast, or alter the display from black on white or white
on black.

Chapter 5: Making the Mac Your Own

 Flash the screen when an alert sound occurs.
 Zoom in on the screen to make everything appear larger.
 Use a Slow Keys function to put a delay between when a key is pressed
and when the result of that keypress is accepted. Or, if you can’t easily
press several keys at once, use Sticky Keys to press groups of modifier
keys (Shift, Ô, Option, and Control) in a sequence.
The Mac may share a nickname with certain McDonald’s hamburgers. But it’s
actually an old Burger King slogan that is most apt when describing your
computer. As this chapter has shown, you can “have it your way.”

S
teve Jobs is fond of big cats. Before Apple unleashed Tiger, previous ver-
sions of Mac OS X software carried such purr-fect monikers as Cheetah,
Puma, Jaguar, and Panther. (Apple used the code words Cheetah and Puma
internally.) Leopard is coming next, perhaps even by the time this book hits
store shelves. Apple is also presumably breeding Lynx and Cougar inside its
Cupertino, California, cages.
As strong a release as it is, the name OS X just doesn’t have the bite that
Tiger or any of the other giant kitty nicknames command. However, X (for
ten) is the most celebrated use of Roman numerals this side of the Super
Bowl.
Tiger actually represents OS X version 10.4. Every year or so, Apple brings
out a new iteration of its operating system software (see the “An operating
system primer” sidebar), complete with a boatload of new features, and iden-
tified by an extra decimal point. Apple says OS X version 10.4 Tiger piled
more than 200 features onto its predecessor OS X version 10.3 Panther. I
haven’t counted.
During the course of a year, Apple will make interim tweaks to its operating
system. You will know because the OS takes on an extra decimal digit. At the
time of this writing, Apple was up to OS X version 10.4.7 (pronounced “ten
dot four dot seven”).
I wonder how many features must be added before Apple changes the desig-
nation to OS XI.

To check out the version of Mac software running on your system, choose
Ú➪About This Mac. Choose Software Update to see whether the OS (and, for
that matter, other programs) are up to date.
Bottom line: Tigers are stunning and powerful creatures. They demand
respect and awe. Something like Apple’s computers.
How Many New Features? 
Let Me Count the Ways
As already noted, Apple added more than 200 features to the Mac OS in Tiger
(and you can expect lots more features when Leopard prances on stage;
Apple was set to preview the new operating system in August 2006). Even if I
had the space, I don’t claim the expertise to do all the new features justice.
As a public service and, um, for your reading pleasure, I thought I’d at least
tick off a few of the items on Apple’s long laundry list of features. I’m letting
Apple do the talking here. I haven’t changed any of the company’s descrip-
tions (except for the boldface lead-ins).
Disclaimer: I’m not trying to demean any of these enhancements. These obvi-
ously provide great value to somebody. I’m just guessing that the items listed
here will collectively interest perhaps 1 percent of you. If you want to skip
ahead, I’m not going to stop you.
 For the international crowd: Tiger includes the Tamil language script, a
new input mode for Korean and extended system fonts to support Greek
(modern and classical), Vietnamese, Cyrillic, and Roman script lan-
guages of the former USSR.
 For UNIX lovers: Use command line file commands on HFS+ items with
proper results. Utilities such as cp, mv, tar, rsync now use the same stan-
dard APIs as Spotlight and access control lists to handle resource forks.
 For networking types: Take advantage of the power of distributed com-
puting with Xgrid, Apple’s easy-to-use tool that turns a group of Macs
into a supercomputer.
 For developers: Take advantage of the latest version of the GCC com-
piler, featuring support for 64-bit code generation.

Chapter 6: Apple’s Feline Fetish
An operating system primer
There is software, friends, and there is SOFT-
WARE. Make no mistake, a computer’s operat-
ing system deserves top billing. If this were a
movie and the opening credits were rolling, the
name of the operating system would appear
above the title. All other performers on your
computer, no matter how much talent they pos-
sess, are supporting players by comparison.
Come to think of it, there would be no movie at
all without the operating system, for it is the
foundation on which all your other programs
run. Minus the OS, that fancy photo editing pro-
gram you bought recently might as well be
chopped liver.
As operating systems go, you are truly fortunate
to have Tiger. OS X earns raves not just because
it’s slick and easy on the eyes. Tiger is robust, reli-
able, and stable. Its underpinning is something
called UNIX, a venerable operating system in its
own right. The brilliance of Apple was in figuring
how to exploit UNIX without making you learn
UNIX. Just be thankful it’s under the hood and
don’t give it another moment’s thought.
Now I know at least some of you can’t leave it
there. You want to investigate UNIX. (You’re the
person I want in the trenches with me.) Okay, here
goes. Open the Applications folder, choose
Utilities, and delve inside a program called
Terminal. What you’ll find here isn’t pretty, as the
figure shows. No icons. No easy menus. You have
split the town of GUI-ville and are now tooling
around with a command line interface— meaning
you have to type arcane commands to tell the
computer what to do. Doing so could wreak havoc
on your system, so be careful. You know what they
say about curiosity killing the cat.

Searching with Spotlight
Whew! Now that I dispensed with that little piece of trivia, it’s time to concen-
trate on Tiger lilies all Mac users will appreciate. I’ll start by putting the spot-
light on Spotlight, a marvelous desktop search utility I practically guarantee will
blow you away. If Spotlight was the only new feature Apple bred into Tiger,
those of you who haven’t bothered to upgrade a previous version of OS X in the
past would have to think long and hard about not doing so this time around.
Here’s why. Search is a big deal. A computer isn’t much good if you can’t
easily lay your hands on the documents, pictures, e-mail messages, and other
programs you need at any particular moment. When most people think about
searching on a computer, they probably have Google, Yahoo!, or some other
Internet search engine in mind. Internet search is of course a big deal too,
and I spend some time discussing it in Chapter 9.
The searching I have in mind here, however, involves the contents of your
own system. Over time, Mac users accumulate thousands of photos, songs,
school reports, work projects, contacts, calendar entries, and you name it.
Spotlight helps you locate them in a blink. It starts spitting out search results
before you finish typing.
What’s even better is that Spotlight can uncover material within documents
and files. That’s incredibly useful if you haven’t the foggiest idea what you
named a file.
Let’s try Spotlight now:
1. Click the blue magnifying glass icon in the upper-right corner of the
menu bar. Or press Ô and the spacebar simultaneously.
The Spotlight search box appears.
2. Enter a word or phrase you want to search for.
The instant you type the first letter, a window shows up with what
Spotlight considers the most likely search matches. The search is imme-
diately refined as you type extra keystrokes, as shown in Figure 6-1.
Searching is so fast you’ll see results more quickly than it takes you to
read this sentence.
Say you’re planning a tropical vacation and remember that your cousin
Gilligan e-mailed you awhile back raving about the beach at some deserted
Pacific island. You can open the Mac Mail program and dig for the missive
from the dozens that Gilligan sent you. (Evidently he had a lot of time on his
hands.) But it’s far simpler and faster to type Gilligan’s name in Spotlight.
84
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

Or maybe you want to give Gilligan a quick buzz. Without Spotlight, you
would probably open your Address Book to find your buddy’s phone number.
The faster way is to type Gilligan in Spotlight and then click his name next
to Contacts in the results window.
Rummaging through your stuff
Spotlight is built into the very fabric of the operating system. Quietly behind
the scenes, Spotlight indexes, or catalogs, all the files on the computer so you
can access them in a moment’s notice. The index is seamlessly updated each
time you add, move, modify, copy, or delete a file.
Moreover, Spotlight automatically rummages through metadata, the informa-
tion about your data. Digital photographs, for example, typically capture the
following metadata: the camera model used to snap the image, the date, the
aperture and exposure settings, whether a flash was used, and so on. For
example, if a friend e-mails you pictures taken with a Kodak camera, you can
quickly find those images — as opposed to, say, the pictures you took with
your own Canon — by entering the search term Kodak.
Figure 6-1:
The
Spotlight
search box.
85
Chapter 6: Apple’s Feline Fetish

Spotlight is one confident sucker. It boldly takes a stab at what it thinks is the
Top Hit, or search result you have in mind. (The Top Hit in Figure 6-1 is a doc-
ument named beach.) Its track record is pretty good. If it guesses right, click
the Top Hit entry. That will either launch the application in question, open a
particular file, or display the appropriate folder in the Finder. As is often the
case, there’s a shortcut. Press Ô and Return to launch the top hit.
Of course, Spotlight isn’t always going to get the Top Hit right, so it also dis-
plays what it considers to be the next 20 most likely matches. Results are seg-
regated into categories (Applications, Documents, Folders, PDF Documents,
Music, Images, Bookmarks, and so on). Again, just click an item to launch or
open it.
Some searches yield more than 20 possible outcomes. Often a heck of a lot
more. That’s what Show All (refer to Figure 6-1) is all about. Clicking Show All
doesn’t, in fact, show you everything. Most of the time your screen wouldn’t
be near big enough anyway.
Instead, Show All opens a separate Spotlight window like the one shown in
Figure 6-2. The most probable search results in each category are listed, fol-
lowed by an indication of how many more results are in each group. Click the
more line (for example, 20 more) to scroll through the list of other possible
search outcomes.
Figure 6-2:

Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

Intelligent searching
You can customize search results in numerous ways. Take a look at the
column on the right side of the Spotlight results window. You can sort out-
comes by Kind (Documents, Mail Messages, and so on), Date (Today,
Yesterday, Previous 7 Days, Previous 30 Days, Earlier), and People (Gilligan,
Ginger, Skipper, and so on). You can also set various sorting preferences
within a group.
The best way to narrow results is to enter as specific a search term as possi-
ble right off the bat. As you plan your vacation, typing beach will probably
summon the e-mail message Gilligan sent you. But because Spotlight will find
all files or programs that match that text, results may also include Power-
Point presentations with a beach theme, pictures of your family by the
seashore, and songs on your hard drives sung by the Beach Boys. Typing
Gilligan and beach together will help you fine-tune your search.
If you know the type of item you’re looking for, such as Gilligan’s e-mail as
opposed to his picture, you can filter the search in another way. Enter the
search term followed by kind and the file type you are looking for, as in
Gilligan kind:email
If you want to search for a presentation someone sent you on the world’s
best seaside resorts but can’t remember whether the presentation was cre-
ated in AppleWorks, Keynote, or PowerPoint, try
seaside resort kind:presentations
And if you want to search only for presentations opened in the past week, type
seaside resort kind:presentations date:last week
To search for an application such as Microsoft Word, type
Word kind:application
To search Gilligan’s contact information, type
Gilligan kind:contacts
To search for music, type
Beach Boys kind:music
87
Chapter 6: Apple’s Feline Fetish

To search for pictures at the beach, type
Beach kind:images
And so on.
Searching your way
Up to now, you’ve let Spotlight determine how to present search matches.
Now let me remind you who’s the boss. This being your Mac and all, you can
have Spotlight search according to your marching orders.
Spotlight pours through pretty much everything on your hard drive — unless
you dictate otherwise. To do so, open Spotlight preferences by clicking at the
bottom of the Spotlight results window. With the Search Results tab selected,
you can check or uncheck the types of items you want Spotlight to search, as
shown in Figure 6-3, and drag the categories in the order you want results to
appear.

If you click the Privacy tab, you can prevent Spotlight from searching particular
locations. Drag folders or disks into the Privacy pane to let Spotlight know that
these are off-limits. Spotlight will remove any associated files from the index.
Find Me a Find
I’ve already told you how Spotlight is embedded in the very fabric of the
operating system. So it should come as no surprise that Spotlight hangs out
as well in Finder windows, the windows you use over and over to browse for
files and folders (press Ô+N to open one).
That there’s a search box inside Finder isn’t novel to anyone who has spent
time with previous versions of OS X. But the similarity ends there. I love base-
ball analogies, so let me explain it this way. The previous Finder search box
was like a solid ballplayer who could hit, say, for a high average. But this
newest Finder search box is more like a five-tool player who not only hits for
average but can throw, run, field, and hit for power. In other words, he can
beat you in a number of ways.
So it goes with the newly powerful Finder search. It lets you tailor searches as
never before. To see it in action, open the search box by pressing Ô+F, or by
choosing File➪Find.
If you click the Privacy tab, you can prevent Spotlight from searching particular
locations. Drag folders or disks into the Privacy pane to let Spotlight know that
these are off-limits. Spotlight will remove any associated files from the index.
The moment you start typing a few characters in the search box, tabs show
up (see Figure 6-4). The top tabs — Servers, Computer, Home, Others — 
dictate where you want to search. Note the Save button. I return to its purpose
in the next section, on Smart Folders.
Just below the tabs are customizable buttons that let you filter a search
according to specific parameters. You can add or delete these “criteria” but-
tons by pressing the + or – at the end of the row (refer to Figure 6-4). Pressing
the – button deletes the entire row.
89
Chapter 6: Apple’s Feline Fetish

Among your choices:
 Kind: by Images, Text, PDF, Movies, Music, Documents, Presentations,
Folders, Applications, Others. Stick with the default Any if you want to
search for all these.
 Last Opened, Last Modified, or Created: Today, Since Yesterday, This
week, Last 2 weeks, This month, Exactly, Before, After, and so on.
 Keywords or Contents: Enter the specific word.
 Size: Greater than, less than.
 Color Label: Choose one of the color dots.
Suppose you want to search for all the songs with the word Lost in the title
that you listened to within the last two weeks. You would tailor a search that
would include Kind, Music, and Last Opened, Within The Last 2 weeks.
Fans of the hit TV series Lost may feel a chill at the mere mention of the Others.
(For those who don’t watch the show, they’re the bad guys.) But you may wel-
come the Others when it comes to running the most specialized search queries
on your Mac. I’ll explain. Under Kind, choose Other as your search criteria. A
dialog box lists filtered attributes you can use in your search, plus a description
of their purpose, as shown in Figure 6-5.
Figure 6-4:
The
powerful
Finder
search box

narrow
searches by

criteria.
90
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

For instance, you can choose a search attribute based on the authors of an
item, makers of a device, due date, duration in seconds, lyricist of a song,
musical key of a song, genre, pixel height of a document, year an item was
recorded, and dozens more attributes.
Before closing out of your Finder window, you may want to save your search
results. To do that, continue with the next section.
Smart Folders
When you go to all the trouble of selecting specific attributes for your search
query, you may want to revisit the search in the future — incorporating the
latest information, of course. And that’s why the Finder window has a handy
Save button.
Traditionally, the files on your computer are organized by their location on
your disk. Smart Folders change the organizing principle based on the search
criteria you’ve chosen. These folders don’t give a hoot where the actual files
that match your search criteria reside on the machine. Those stay put in
their original location. You are, in effect, working on aliases, or shortcuts, of
those files. (See the next chapter for more on aliases.)
What’s more, behind the scenes, Smart Folders are constantly on the prowl
for new items that match your search criteria. In other words, they’re
updated in real time.
To create a Smart Folder, click that Save button from inside the Finder
window. (The Save button is shown in the upper right in Figure 6-4.) A box
Figure 6-5:
Choosing

91
Chapter 6: Apple’s Feline Fetish

pops up asking you to specify a name and destination for your newly created
Smart Folder, as shown in Figure 6-6. If you want, select the Add to Sidebar
option to easily find the Smart Folder you just created.
Alternatively, choose New Smart Folder under the Finder File menu to create
a new Smart Folder.
You may want to create a simple Smart Folder containing all the documents
you’ve worked on in the past seven days. Give it an original name. Oh, I
dunno, something like What a Hellish Week! In any case, all your recent stuff
is easily at your disposal. Your older documents will pass new arrivals on
their way out.
Fiddling with Dashboard Widgets
Apart from prowling the virtual corridors of cyberspace or interacting with
Apple’s iLife programs, most of your face time on a Mac will find you engaged
with some full-blown (and often pricey) software application — even if you
take advantage of a relatively narrow set of features.
The wordsmiths among you couldn’t subsist without Microsoft Word or some
other industrial-strength word processor. You graphics artists live and
breathe Adobe Photoshop. But personal computing isn’t always about doc-
toring photos or penning the great American novel (or Dummies book).
Sometimes all you want is a quick snippet of information.
Maybe you need to check the temperature or a stock quote. Or you want to
look up a phone number or figure out if your plane is on time. Perhaps you want
to locate an Italian restaurant for dinner or calculate a mortgage payment.
That’s what a gaggle of mini-applications known as widgets are all about.
Indeed, these lightweight programs generally serve a useful and singular pur-
pose: from letting you track an overnight package to finding out whether your

favorite team covered the spread. Frankly, you can perform many of these
tasks through the Web or other programs on your desktop. But few do it with
the convenience and flair of widgets.
Fronted by large colorful icons, widgets come at you en masse when you
summon Dashboard. This translucent screen, shown in Figure 6-7, lays on top
of your desktop. Nothing underneath is disturbed.
You either click the Dashboard icon in the dock (labeled in Figure 6-7) or
press the F12 key to open the Dashboard. Pressing F12 again closes
Dashboard. You can exit also by clicking anywhere other than on a widget.
To get you started, Apple supplies a collection of basic widgets (calculator,
clock, calendar, weather). The more interesting widgets are available online.
(More than 2000 were available as of this writing.) You can embark on a
widget hunt at www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard.

You either click the Dashboard icon in the dock (labeled in Figure 6-7) or
When you call up Dashboard, only the widgets you previously used appear
on the screen, right where you left them. The rest are cozying up to the wid-
gets bar, which you can open by clicking the + button (labeled in Figure 6-7). If
you want to enlist one of the widgets, just drag it onto the Dashboard area. It
will dazzle you with a ripple effect as it makes its grand entrance. Click the X
button (labeled in Figure 6-8) to close the widgets bar.
The great majority of downloadable widgets are gratis. A few are available as
shareware, meaning you can try them out before paying. Whether you actu-
ally fork over the loot is up to your conscience, but unless you think the pro-
gram is worthless, its creator should be rewarded for his or her efforts.
Some widgets are extensions to other programs on your computer, such as
the ones that display data from iCal or your Address Book or bring up blank
Stickies.
But most widgets grab feeds off the Internet, so you need an online connec-
tion (see Chapter 9). Widgets in this category might tell you what’s on the
tube tonight or deliver a surfing report (on waves, dude, not cyberspace.)

or close in super-slow-motion.
 If you hover over an open widget and press Ô+R, the wizard twists like a
tornado and refreshes itself. Any “live” information will be updated.
 To rearrange widgets on the Dashboard area, just drag them around.
 You can display more than one of the same widget, which is useful, say,
if you want to check out the weather or time in several locations. Just
drag the widget out again from its hiding place in the widgets bar.
In Chapter 21, I rattle off ten widget goodies.
Before we skip out on this widgets seminar, let me mention one more in pass-
ing, a widget to manage all your other widgets.. The widget shown in Figure
6-9 contains a list of other widgets (People, Researcher, Ski Report, and so
on). By unchecking the names of the widgets in the list, you can disable them
and in some instances send them to the trash. If you click the More Widgets
button, you’ll be transported to Apple’s main Dashboard Widgets Web page,
where you can download other widgets.

Chapter 6: Apple’s Feline Fetish

Tiger includes a feature called Automator that lets you program repetitive
tasks — renaming a batch of files, say — without having to master program-
ming. This is Apple’s way of automating or simplifying a computer practice
known as scripts.
Automator is built around specific tasks, or actions (Open Images in Preview,
for example), dragged from an Action list to a workflow area on the right side
of the window, as shown in Figure 6-10.
When you’ve dragged all the actions into the workflow area, click the Run
button in the upper-right corner of the Automator window; each action is
performed in a natural order with the results of one task flowing into the next
one. Thus, various tasks must be performed in sequence and make sense
working together.
To open Automator, open Finder, click Applications, and then double-click
Automator.
Figure 6-10:
Automator is

A single action can constitute a workflow. To take a rudimentary example, you
can automate the process of removing empty playlists in iTunes by dragging
that action into the workflow space and clicking Run. A Workflow Execution
Completed message at the bottom-right corner of Automator signifies that the
job is finished. (For more on playlists and iTunes, read Chapter 14.)
Often multiple tasks make up a workflow. In the simple workflow shown in
Figure 6-11, the computer will search the address book for people having a
birthday this month, and send an e-mail greeting (with picture) to those folks.
You can save and reuse workflows by pressing Ô+Shift+S.
Third-party developers are creating workflow actions for their applications.
You can check some of these out at www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/
automator.
Automator is just one more reason to feel good about the Tiger in your tank.

In coach-speak, the mission of the moment is to master the computing equiv-
alent of blocking and tackling: basic word processing and the other funda-
mentals required to get you through training camp and ultimately your daily
routine.
Practice these now. You can pour the Gatorade on my head later.
Form and Function: The Essentials 
of Word Processing
I’m old enough to recall life before word processors. (Hey it wasn’t that long
ago.)
I can’t possibly begin to fathom how we survived in the days before every
last one of us had access to word processors and computers on our
respective desks.
Pardon the interruption, but I’m not thrilled with the preceding sentence.
Kind of wordy and repetitious. Permit me to get right to the point.
I can’t imagine how any of us got along without word processors.
Thanks, much more concise.
The purpose of this mini-editing exercise is to illustrate the splendor of word
processing. Had I produced these sentences on a typewriter instead of a com-
puter, changing even a few words would hardly seem worth it. I would have
to use correction fluid to erase my previous comments and type over them. If
things got really messy, or I wanted to take my writing in a different direction,
I’d end up yanking the sheet of paper from the typewriter in disgust and
begin pecking away anew on a blank page.
Word processing lets you substitute words at will, move entire blocks of text
around with panache, and apply different fonts and typefaces to the charac-
ters. You won’t even take a productivity hit swapping typewriter ribbons in
the middle of a project (though, as the next chapter reveals, you will at some
point have to replace the ink in your printer).
Before running out to buy Microsoft Word (or another industrial strength and
expensive) word processing program for your Mac — and I’m not suggesting
you don’t — it’s my obligation to point out that Apple includes a respectable
word processor with OS X. The program is TextEdit, and it calls the Applications
folder home. TextEdit will be our classroom for much of this chapter.

Creating a Document
The first order of business using TextEdit (or pretty much any word proces-
sor) is to create a new document. There’s really not much to it. It’s about as
easy as opening the program itself. The moment you do so, a window with a
large blank area on which to type appears, as Figure 7-1 shows.
Have a look around the window. At top you see Untitled because no one at
Apple is presumptuous enough to come up with a name for your yet-to-be-
produced manuscript. We’ll get around to naming (and saving) your stuff
later. In my experience it helps to write first and add a title later, though, um,
scholars may disagree.
Notice the blinking vertical line at the upper-left edge of the screen, just
below the ruler. That line, called the insertion point, might as well be tapping
out Morse code for “start typing here.”
Indeed, friends, you have come to the most challenging point in the entire
word processing experience, and believe me it has nothing to do with tech-
nology. The burden is on you to produce clever, witty, and inventive prose,
lest all that blank space go to waste.
Okay, got it? At the blinking insertion point, type with abandon. Something
original like
Figure 7-1:
In the
beginning
was a blank
page.
101
Chapter 7: Handling All That Busy Work

It was a dark and stormy night
If you type like I do, you may have accidentally produced
It was a drk and stormy nihgt
Fortunately, your amiable word processor has your best interests at heart.
See the dotted red line below drk and nihgt (see Figure 7-2)? That’s TextEdit’s
not-so-subtle way of flagging a likely typo. (This presumes you’ve left the
default Check Spelling As You Type activated in TextEdit Preferences. Since
we’re at the beginning of this exercise, that seems a safe presumption.)
You can address these snafus in several ways. You can use the computer’s
Delete key to wipe out all the letters to the left of the insertion point. (Delete
functions like the backspace key on the Smith Corona you put out to pasture
years ago.) After the misspelled word has been quietly sent to Siberia, you
can type over the space more carefully. All traces of your sloppiness disappear.
Delete is a wonderfully handy key. I’d recommend using it to eliminate a
single word such as nihgt. But in our little case study, we have to repair drk
too. And using Delete to erase drk means sacrificing and and stormy as well.
Kind of overkill if you ask me.

Back to football. It’s time to call an audible. Two quick options:
 Use the left-facing arrow key (found on the lower-right side of the key-
board) to move the insertion point to the spot just to the right of the
word you want to deep-six. No characters are eliminated when you move
the insertion point that way. Only when the insertion point is where it
ought to be do you again hire your reliable keyboard hit-man, Delete.
 Eschew the keyboard and click with the mouse to reach this same spot
to the right of the misspelled word. Then press Delete.
Now try this helpful remedy. Right-click anywhere on the misspelled word. A
list appears with suggestions, as shown in Figure 7-3. Single-click the correct
word and, voila, it instantly replaces the mistake. Be careful in this example
not to choose dork.

Selecting Text in a Document
Let’s try another experiment. Double-click a word. See what happens. It’s as if
you ran a light-blue marker across the word. You’ve highlighted, or selected,
this word so that it can be deleted, moved, or changed.
Many times, you’ll want to select more than a single word. Perhaps a com-
plete sentence. Or a paragraph. Or several paragraphs. Here’s how to high-
light a block of text to delete it:
1. Using the mouse, point to the block in question.
2. Press and hold down the left mouse button and drag the cursor
(which bears a slight resemblance to the Seattle Space Needle) across
the entire section you want to highlight.
The direction in which you drag the mouse affects what gets highlighted.
If you drag horizontally, a single line is selected. Dragging vertically
selects an entire block. You can highlight text also by holding down Shift
and using the arrow keys.
3. Release the mouse button when you reach the end of the passage you
want highlighted, as shown with Once upon a time in Figure 7-4.
4. To immediately wipe out the selected text, press Delete.
Alternatively, start typing. Your old material is exorcised upon your very
first keystroke and filled in with the new characters you type.
To select several pages of text at once, single-click at the beginning portion of
the material you want to select, and then scroll to the very bottom. While
holding down the Shift key, click again. Everything in between clicks is high-
lighted.
Now suppose you were overzealous and selected too much text. Or maybe
you released the mouse a bit too soon so that not enough of the passage you
have in mind was highlighted. Just click once with your mouse to de-select
the selected area and try again.
Another screw-up. This time you annihilated text that upon further review
you want to keep. Fortunately, the Mac lets you perform a do-over. Choose
Edit➪Undo Typing. The text is miraculously revived. Variations of this lifesav-
ing Undo command can be found in most of the Mac programs you
encounter. So before losing sleep over some silly thing you did on the com-
puter, visit the Edit menu and check out your Undo options.

Dragging and Dropping
In Chapter 3 I discuss dragging and dropping to move icons to the dock. In this
chapter, we drag an entire block of text to a new location and leave it there.
Select a passage in one of the ways mentioned in the preceding section. Now,
anywhere on the highlighted area, click and hold down the mouse button.
Roll the mouse across a flat surface to drag the text to its new destination.
Release the mouse button to drop off the text.
You are not restricted to dragging and dropping text in the program you’re in.
You can lift text completely out of TextEdit and into Word, Stickies, or Pages,
an Apple program for producing spiffy-looking newsletters and brochures.
Alternatively, if you know you’ll want to use a text block in another program
at some point in the future — you just don’t know when — drop it directly
onto the Mac desktop (see Figure 7-5) and call upon it whenever necessary.
Text copied to the desktop will be shown as an icon and named from text in
the beginning of the selection you copied. Moving text in this manner to an
external program or the desktop constitutes a Copy command, not a Move
command, so the lifted text remains in the original source.

Cutting and Pasting
In the preceding section, we copied material from one location and moved a
copy to another location. By contrast, cutting and pasting lifts material from
one spot and moves it elsewhere without leaving anything behind. (In the
typewriter era, you literally cut out passages of paper with scissors and
pasted them onto new documents.)
After selecting your source material, choose Edit➪Cut (or the keyboard alter-
native Ô+X). To paste to a new location, navigate to the spot and choose
Edit➪Paste (or Ô+V).
The Cut command is easily confused with Copy (Ô+C). As the name suggests,
the latter copies selected text that can be pasted somewhere else. Cut clips
text out of its original spot.
The very last thing you copied or cut is temporary sheltered on the clip-
board. It remains there until replaced by newer material you copy or cut.

Changing the Font
When typewriters were in vogue, you were pretty much limited to the type-
face of the machine. Computers being computers, you can alter the appear-
ance of individual characters and complete words effortlessly. Let’s start with
something simple.
In the TextEdit window, click the pop-up menu Styles (see Figure 7-6) and
choose Italic. Highlighted text becomes text. Now try Bold. Highlighted text
becomes text.
I recommend using keyboard shortcuts in this instance. Just before typing a
word, try Ô+I for italics or Ô+B for bold. When you want to revert to normal
type, just press those respective keyboard combinations again.
Figure 7-6:
The Styles
menu.
107
Chapter 7: Handling All That Busy Work

Making words bold or italic is the tip of the proverbial iceberg. You can dress
up documents with different fonts, or typefaces.
Open the Format menu and choose Font➪Show Fonts. The window in Figure
7-7 appears. You can change the typeface of any highlighted text by clicking a
font listed in the pane labeled Family. Choices carry names like Arial, Baghdad,
Chalkboard, Courier, Desdemona, Helvetica, Papyrus, Stencil, and Times 
New Roman.
Unless you wrote your graduate thesis on Fontomology (don’t bother looking
the word up; it’s my invention), nobody on the Dummies faculty expects you
to have a clue about what any of the aforementioned fonts look like. I sure
don’t. Cheating is okay. Peek at your document to see how highlighted words
in the text change after clicking different font choices.
As usual, another way is available. In the lower-left corner of the Font
window, click the icon that looks like the sun. Choose Show Preview from the
menu (see Figure 7-8). You’ll be able to inspect various font families and type-
faces in the preview pane that appears above your selection. Click the sun
icon again to choose Hide Preview.
Figure 7-7:

You can also preview the type size of your chosen font, as measured by a
standard unit called points. In general, one inch has 72 points. You can also
type your own words to see how they would look in a given font.
Revealing the Font Book
You likely have well over a hundred fonts on your computer, if not a lot more.
Some were supplied with TextEdit. Some arrived with other word processing
programs. You may have even gone on a font hunt and added more yourself
on the Internet. At the end of the day, you may need help managing and orga-
nizing them.
That’s the purpose behind an OS X program called Font Book, found in the
Applications folder. It’s shown in Figure 7-9. Think of Font Book as a gallery to
show off all your finest fonts. Indeed, fonts here are grouped in collections.
Previewing your font

The main font groupings are listed as following:
 User: The private fonts unique to your user account (Chapter 5).
 Computer: The public fonts available to anyone who uses this machine.
 Classic: Fonts that work with applications in the ancient pre-OS X
Classic mode. Despite their prehistoric pedigree, nothing in the rule
book prevents you from employing these with Tiger.
You can create your own font collections by choosing File➪New Collection
and typing a name for the collection. Then just drag fonts from the Fonts
column into your new collection.

By clicking a name in the Font column, you can sample what your font of
choice looks like in the pane on the right. Drag the slider (labeled in Figure 7-9)
to the right of that pane to adjust the type size of the fonts you’re sampling.
If you’re like most mortals, you’ll use a small set of fonts in your lifetime. I’ll
lay odds you’ll never take advantage of such esoteric fonts as Ayuthaya or
Zapf Dingbats (see the “All in the fonts” sidebar). Trust me, I am not making
these names up.
You can disable the fonts you’ll rarely if ever use by clicking the little box
with the check mark under the Font list (labeled in Figure 7-9). The word Off
appears next the font’s newly grayed-out name. If you change your mind,
choose Edit➪Enable font you disabled.
If, on the other hand, you want to add fonts to the machine, click the + button
under the same column and browse to the font’s location on your machine.
But you can also install new fonts you’ve downloaded or purchased by
simply double-clicking them. The fonts are automatically imported into Font
Book.
When a dot appears next to a name in the Font list, duplicates of that font
family are installed. Select the font in question and choose Edit➪Resolve
Duplicates.
Formatting Your Document
Fancy fonts aren’t the only way to doll up a document. You have important
decisions to make about proper margins, paragraph indentations, and text
tabs. And you must determine whether lines of text should be single or
double-spaced. Hey it’s still a lot easier than using a typewriter.
111
Chapter 7: Handling All That Busy Work
All in the fonts
Admit it, you’re curious about the genealogy
behind the font named Zapf Dingbats. Me too.
For that matter, you may be wondering about the
roots of other fonts on the system. Hey, it’s your
computer, you have a right to know. Press Ô+I
and the Font Book window reveals all, including
the full name of a font, the languages in which it
is used, and any copyright and trademark infor-
mation. Best I can tell, Zapf Dingbats was not
created by Archie Bunker.

Okay, we’re back in our TextEdit classroom. Set your margins and tab stops
by dragging the tiny triangles along the ruler.
Now click the drop-down menu that says Spacing, just above the ruler.
Clicking Single separates the lines in the way you are reading them in this
paragraph.
If I go with Double, the line jumps down to here, and the next line
jumps down to here.
Got it?
The control freaks among you (you know who you are) might want to click
Other under the Spacing menu. It displays the dialog box shown in Figure
7-10. Now you can precisely determine the height of your line, the way the
paragraphs are spaced (that is, the distance from the bottom of a paragraph
to the top of the first line in the paragraph below), and other parameters,
according to the points system.
Here are other tricks that make TextEdit a capable writing companion:
 Aligning paragraphs: After clicking anywhere in a paragraph, choose
Format➪Text and choose an alignment (left, center, justified, or right).
Play around with these choices to determine what looks best.
 Writing from right to left: I suppose this one’s useful for writing in
Hebrew or Arabic. Choose Format➪Text➪Writing Direction and then
click Right to Left. Click again to go back the other way, or choose
Edit➪Undo Set Writing Direction.
 Locating text: You can use the Find command under the Edit menu to
uncover multiple occurrences of specific words and phrases and replace
them individually or collectively.

 Producing lists: Sometimes the best way to get your message across is
in list form. Kind of like what I’m doing here. By clicking the Lists drop-
down menu, you can present a list with bullets, numbers, roman numer-
als, uppercase or lowercase letters, and more, as shown in Figure 7-11.
Keep clicking the choices until you find the one that makes the most
sense.
 Creating tables: Then again, you may want to emphasize important
points using a table or chart. Choose Format➪Text➪Table. In the
window that appears (see Figure 7-12), you can select the number of
rows and columns you need for your table. You can select a color back-
ground for each cell by clicking the Cell Background drop-down list and
choosing Color Fill, and then choosing a hue from the palette that
appears when you click the rectangle to the right. You can drag the bor-
ders of a row or a column to alter its dimensions. You can also merge or
split table cells by selecting the appropriate cells and then clicking the
Merge Cells or Split Cells button.

Saving Your Work
You’ve worked so darn hard making your document read well and look nice
that I’d hate to see all your efforts go to waste. And yet in the cruel world of
computers that’s precisely what could happen if you don’t take a second to
save your file. And a second is all it takes to save a file — but you can lose
everything just as fast.
Stable as it is, the Mac is a machine for goodness sakes and not immune to
power failures or human foibles. Odd as it may seem, even tech authors
pound a calamitous combination of keys from time to time.
All the work you’ve done so far exists in an ethereal kind of way, as part of tem-
porary memory (see Chapter 2). Don’t let the fact that you can see something
on your computer monitor fool you. If you shut down your computer, or it
unexpectedly crashes (it’s been known to happen even on Macs), any unsaved
material will reside nowhere but in another type of memory. Your own.
So where exactly do you save your work? Why on the Save sheet of course
(see Figure 7-13). It slides into view from the top of your document when you
press the keyboard combo Ô+S, or choose File➪Save.
Remember way back in the beginning of this chapter when I mentioned that
Apple wouldn’t dare name a file for you (except to give it the temporary
moniker Untitled). Well this is your big chance to call the file something spe-
cial by filling in a title where it says Save As. Go ahead and name it, I dunno,
Dark and Stormy.
Figure 7-12:
Creating a
table.
114
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

When you click the Save button, the contents of Dark and Stormy are
assigned to a permanent home on your Mac’s hard drive, at least until you’re
ready to work on the document again.
But there’s more. You get to choose in which folder to stash the file. The Mac
suggests the Documents folder, which seems like and often is a logical choice.
But you can choose among several other possible destinations, as becomes
clear when you click the arrow next to where you just named your document.
You will see the sidebar we first became acquainted with in Chapter 3. You
can stuff your manuscript in any existing folder or subfolder or create one
from scratch by clicking the New Folder button and giving the folder a name.
It’s time to confess. I’ve been holding back. When you christened your opus
Dark and Stormy little did you know that you were actually giving it a slightly
longer name: Dark and Stormy.rtf. The little suffix, or extension, stands for
Rich Text Format, one of the file format types the Mac makes nice with. You
could have saved the file in the Microsoft Word format, which would have
given the file the .doc extension. Or you could have chosen HTML, the lan-
guage of the World Wide Web (see Chapter 9). If you want to see what exten-
sions are tagged to your various files, deselect the Hide Extension check box.
So let’s review: As you work on documents, you are hereby advised to save
and save often.
Figure 7-13:
Everyone

Chapter 7: Handling All That Busy Work

Making Revisions
Dark and Stormy is safe and sound on your hard drive. But after downing a
few chill pills overnight, you have a brand-new outlook on life in the morning.
You’re past your brooding period. You want to rework your inspiration’s cen-
tral theme and give it a new name too, Bright and Sunny.
Back to TextEdit we go.
Choose File➪Open. A dialog box appears. Scroll down in the folder where you
last saved your document, and double-click its name or icon when you find it.
You are now ready to apply your changes. Because your document is only as
permanent as the last time you saved it, remember to save it early and often,
as you make revisions. Along the way, you can rename your bestseller by
using Save As and choosing a new name, though you’ll still have a version
under the old name.
You may be better off renaming a file by selecting it (from a Finder window or
the desktop) and pressing Enter. Type the new name and press Enter again.
As always, your Mac tries to assist you in these matters. The computer
makes the assumption that if you worked on a document yesterday or the
day before, you might want to take another stab at it today. And to prevent
you, Oh Prolific One, from having to strain too hard digging for a document
you may want to edit, choose File➪Open Recent. Your freshest files will turn
up in the list. Just click the name of the document you want to revisit.
Perhaps the fastest way to find a file you want to revise is to use the Spotlight
tool, featured in the Chapter 6. Choose Spotlight by single-clicking its icon at
the upper-right corner of the screen and type the name of the manuscript
that requires your attention.
Taking Out the Trash
Like much else in life, documents, if not entire folders, inevitably outlive their
usefulness. The material grows stale. It takes on a virtual stench. It claims
hard drive space you could put to good use elsewhere.
Yes it’s time to take out the trash.
116
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

Use the mouse to drag the document’s icon above the trash can in the dock.
Release the mouse button when the trash can turns black.
As usual, there’s a keyboard alternative, Ô+Delete. Or you can choose File➪
Move to Trash.
You’ll know you have stuff in the trash because the icon shows crumpled
paper. And just like your real life trash bin, you’ll want to completely empty it
from time to time. (Your neighbors might complain otherwise.)
To do so, choose Empty Trash under the Finder menu or press Ô+Shift+Delete.
A warning will pop up (see Figure 7-14), reminding you that once your trash is
gone, it’s gone, as if it was going through a shredder. (Even then you may be
able to get it back, but you’ll have to fork over some coin by purchasing data
recovery software or hiring an expert.)
Never Mind: Retrieving 
What You’ve Tossed
It’s pretty easy to pull something out of the trash, provided you didn’t take
that last Draconian measure and select Empty Trash. And it’s less smelly or
embarrassing than sticking your hands in a real trash bin. Click the Trash
icon in the dock to peek at its contents. If you find something worth saving
after all, merely drag it back onto the desktop or into the folder where it used
to hang out.
If you’re absolutely, positively certain that you want to get rid of the contents
of your trash — and paranoid about industrial spies recovering the docs,
choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder menu instead of the regular
Empty Trash command.
Figure 7-14:
Think before
trashing.
117
Chapter 7: Handling All That Busy Work

Making an Alias
You can create an alias of a file to serve as a shortcut for finding it, no matter
where it’s buried on your Mac. To understand what an alias is, it helps to
understand what it’s not. It’s not a full duplicate of a file. (If you want to
create a full duplicate, press Ô+D or choose File➪Duplicate.)
Instead, you are effectively copying the file’s icon, not the file itself, meaning
you are barely using any disk space. Clicking an alias icon summons the origi-
nal file no matter where it’s hanging out on the computer and even if you’ve
renamed the file.
Why create an alien in the first place? Perhaps you’re not sure where to place a
file that you could easily justify putting in any number of folders. For instance,
if you have a document titled Seven Dwarfs, it might belong in a folder for Snow
White, one for Bashful, one for Doc, and so on. Because the Mac lets you create
multiple aliases, you can effectively place the file in each of those folders (even
though you and I know it really resides in only one place.)
To create an alias, highlight the original icon and press Ô+L or choose File➪
Make Alias. You can also drag an icon out of its file window at the same time
you hold down the Option and Ô keys.
As you can see in Figure 7-15, the alias looks like a clone of the original icon,
except the alias suffix is added to its name, and a tiny arrow appears on the
lower-left corner of the icon. Clicking either brings up the same file.
If you want to find the location of the original file, highlight the alias icon and
choose File➪Show Original.
To get rid of an alias, drag it to the trash. Doing so does not delete the original
file.
If you had separately deleted the original file, the alias can’t bring it back. But
you can link the alias to a new file on the machine.

omputers are supposed to bring relief to packrats. The idea that you can
store documents and files in their electronic state on your hard drive —
thus reducing physical clutter — has widespread appeal. A few trees might
breathe a sigh of relief too.
Yet for all the buzz over the years surrounding the potential for a “paperless”
society, I don’t reckon pulp industry executives are losing much sleep.
Fact is, you want to pick up something tangible for your own edification and
convenience. And you want hard copies to show people. It’s better to hand
grandma printed pictures of the newborn rather than pull out a computer (or
other gizmo) to show off your latest bundle of joy. What’s more, even in the
age of e-mail and electronic filings, you still usually print documents and
reports for employers, teachers, financial institutions, and (sigh) the Internal
Revenue Service.
Which reminds me: Despite wonderful advances in state-of-the-art printers,
the counterfeiters among you will find no helpful hints in this chapter about
printing money.

120
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 
Choosing a Printer
What are those state-of-the-art printers? So kind of you to ask. Today’s print-
ers generally fall into two main camps: inkjet or laser, with the differences
coming down to how ink makes its way onto a page. Printers vary by speed,
features, resolution (sharpness), quality of the output, and price.
The most popular models are produced by Canon, Epson, and Hewlett-Packard,
but you can buy printers of one type or another from a host of competitors.
Believe it or not, you can still find an el-cheapo hand-me-down daisy-wheel or
dot-matrix printer on eBay and elsewhere. But these so-called impact printers
are most definitely not the state-of-the-art I have in mind. Keep them a safe
distance removed from your very modern Mac. Purchasing a daisy-wheel for
a Mac would be along the lines of adorning the Queen of England with cos-
tume jewelry. Not to mention the royal pain you’d have trying to hook up
these relics.
In this section, we take a closer look at your most realistic printing options.
Inkjets
Inkjet printers consist of nozzles that squirt droplets of ink onto a blank
sheet of paper. Models may be equipped with a single black cartridge and a
single color cartridge. Or they may contain several color cartridges.
Where’s that magenta cartridge when I need it?
Most of you, I suspect, will end up with an inkjet printer. They are the least
expensive to buy, with some rock-bottom models costing as little as $40.
Bargains aren’t always what they seem, however. The cost of ownership of
inkjet printers can be exorbitant. You must replace pricey ($30 or so) ink car-
tridges on a routine basis, more often if you spit out lots of photographs of
your pet kitten Fluffy. So an inkjet printer’s cost-per-page tends to be consid-
erably higher than that of its laser cousins.
Having said that, inkjets are generally the most flexible bet for consumers,
especially if you demonstrate shutterbug tendencies. Besides standard size 
81⁄2-by-11-inch paper, some inkjet models can produce fine looking 4-by-6-inch
color snapshots on glossy photographic paper. (Photo paper, I’m obligated to
point out, is expensive.)
Granted, black text produced on an inkjet won’t look nearly as crisp as the
text produced by a laser, though it can be quite decent just the same. Under

certain conditions, some inks bleed or smudge. But for the most part, the
quality of inkjets is perfectly acceptable for producing, say, family newslet-
ters or brochures for your burgeoning catering business.
Lasers
It’s somewhat remarkable that a focused laser beam can produce such excel-
lent quality graphics. Then again, if lasers can correct nearsightedness and
perform other medical miracles, perhaps printing isn’t such a major deal
after all.
Laser printers use a combination of heat, ink, and static electricity to pro-
duce superb images on paper. Such printers, especially color models, used to
fetch thousands of dollars. To be sure, you’ll still find prices for some models
in the stratosphere. But entry-level color lasers are now south of $500.
However affordable they have become in recent years, lasers still command a
premium over inkjets. But they are far more economical over the long term.
Toner cartridges are relatively cheap and don’t need to be replaced very
often. A highly efficient laser might cost a couple of cents per page to oper-
ate, a small fraction of what an inkjet costs to run.
Lasers remain a staple in corporate offices. Businesses appreciate the photo-
copier-like output and the fact that lasers can handle high-volume printing
loads at blistering speeds. The machines typically offer more paper handling
options as well.
All-in-ones
Printers print, of course. But if your Mac is the centerpiece of a home office,
you probably have other chores in mind. Copying and scanning, for instance.
And faxing too. (Although as you discover later in this chapter, Macs with
built-in modems can fax without a separate fax machine.) An all-in-one model,
otherwise known as a multifunction printer, can provide some combination of
these tasks. Most multifunction workhorses in home offices are inkjet based.
It’s cheaper to buy a single multifunction device than several standalone
devices. That lone machine takes up less space too. And many current all-in-
ones are photo friendly.
If your fax, copier, or scanner goes on the fritz, you may also have to live
without a printer while the multifunction unit is under repair.
121
Chapter 8: Printing and Faxing

What else to think about
Other features to consider when shopping for a printer follow:
 Large paper trays: Few things are more annoying than having to load a
fresh stack of paper in the middle of an important printing job. With a fat
paper tray, you won’t be hassled quite as often. And some models have
separate trays for photo paper, so you won’t have to constantly shuffle
different types of paper in and out depending on what you’re printing.
 Memory slots: Maybe I shouldn’t mention this feature in a Mac book.
Because frankly, their purpose is to take the Mac out of the equation.
Indeed, you can print images stored on a memory card without getting a
computer involved.
 LCD display: You use this for peeking at the pictures you want to print
(see preceding item) without the benefit of a computer. You can use the
display also for various menu functions on the machine.
 Two-sided printing: This is useful (you guessed it) for printing on both
sides of a sheet of paper.
 Networking capabilities: For sharing your printer among multiple Macs
or Windows PCs or both. Wireless network printers cost more. I’ll speak
more of networking in Chapter 18.
Connecting and Activating a Printer
Almost all printers compatible with OS X, and that includes most printers
sold today, connect to your Mac through the Universal Serial Bus (USB) port
we became acquainted with in Chapter 2. So much for un-retiring the printer
in the closet that connects through what’s called a parallel port.
Here’s one of my pet peeves. You shell out all this loot for a dandy printer
only to have the salesperson tell you it doesn’t come with the USB cable you
need to connect it. In fact, that’s the norm. Manufacturers are notoriously
chintzy when it comes to supplying this necessary accessory. They’ll tell you
they don’t include such a cable because people already have them. I’m not
buying it. My feeling is that it’s the company’s way of advertising a lower
price for a printer, while ultimately making a generous markup.
Indeed, you’ll almost certainly leave the store considerably poorer than you
would have first imagined. Gotta buy stacks of paper. Plus extra ink because
the starter cartridges included with your printer may not last very long. And
the aforementioned USB cable.
122
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

Ready, Set, Print
You have ink. You have paper. You have a USB cable. You are antsy. Time’s a
wasting. I sense a certain impatience. So let’s get around to the task at hand.
Plug the printer into an AC wall jack. Plug the USB cable into the USB port on
the Mac and make sure it’s connected snugly to the printer itself. Turn on
your printer. The thing is warmed and ready for action. Tiger big-heartedly
assembled most of the software drivers required to communicate with
modern printers. Chances are yours is one of them. If not, it probably resides
on the software that came with the printer. Or visit the company’s Web site.
Configuring wireless or wired (through Ethernet) networked printers is a tad
more complicated. For now, we’ll assume we’ve connected a USB printer.
Open the Mac’s trusted word processor, TextEdit. Then follow these steps:
1. Open the document you want to print.
2. Choose File➪Print, or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+P.
Even though we’re doing this exercise in TextEdit, you’ll find the Print
command under the File menu across your Mac software library. The
Ô+P shortcut works across the board too. The print window shown in
Figure 8-1 appears.
3. Click the Printer drop-down list and select your printer, if available.
4. If your connected USB printer is not in the print window:
a. Click Add Printer in the drop-down list.
The Printer Setup Utility opens. You can access the utility also
from the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder.

b. If your printer appears in the list, click to select it (if it’s not
already selected) and you’re golden. Continue with Step 5.
c. If your printer isn’t listed, choose Add from the Printer List.
A Printer Browser sheet appears.
d. Click the printer connection type at the top and make the appro-
priate selection, as shown in Figure 8-2.
In that connection type box, choices likely include USB, AppleTalk
(signifying a network), Bluetooth (a type of wireless connection),
and so on. When you make your choice, the Mac will search for
any available printers and their drivers.
e. Highlight the printer you want to use and then click Add.
5. Make your selections in the print window.
Select which pages to print (All is the default, but you can give any range
by tabbing from one From box to the other.) You also get to select the
number of copies you need. You can check a box to indicate whether
you want pages collated. And you can choose whether to save your doc-
ument in the Adobe PDF format.
Note that print dialog boxes differ slightly from program to program. In
Microsoft Word, for instance, you can get a quick preview of the docu-
ment you want to print.

6. When you’re satisfied with your selections, click Print.
If all goes according to plan, your printer will oblige.
Even if the Mac instantly recognizes your printer, I recommend loading any
Mac installation discs that came with the printer. I specify Mac installation
disc because printers that work with both Macs and Windows — and again
that includes most models — may well supply separate discs for each operat-
ing system.
I know what you must be thinking. Why bother? My printer is already printing
stuff out. So smart of you to ask. The answer is that the disc might supply
you with extra fonts (see Chapter 7), as well as useful software updates.
It wouldn’t hurt to also visit the printer manufacturer’s Web site to see
whether updated printer drivers are available.
Printing it your way
The Mac gives you a lot of control over how your printer will behave and
your printouts will look.
You may have noticed another pop-up menu in the print sheet called Copies &
Pages. Click, and a gaggle of other choices are revealed. Let’s examine most
of them:
 Layout: You can select the number of “pages” that will get printed on a
single sheet of paper, and determine the ways those pages will be laid
out, as shown in Figure 8-3. You can also choose a page border (Single
Thin Line, Double Hairline, and so on).
Figure 8-3:
Choosing a
print layout.
125
Chapter 8: Printing and Faxing

 Scheduler: Suppose that you have to print dozens of invitations for your
spouse’s surprise birthday party and want to make sure to do so when
your honey is out of the house. Set your Mac to print at a time when the
two of you are out together.
 Paper Handling: You can choose to print only odd- or even-numbered
pages or to print pages in reverse order. You can also scale a page so
that it fits a legal- or letter-sized sheet, an envelope, or a variety of other
paper sizes.
 ColorSync: Choose this setting if you want to add black and white, blue
tone, sepia, or other filters.
 Cover Page: Pretend you work for the CIA. Then print a cover sheet stat-
ing that everything else you’re printing is classified, confidential, or top
secret? (Yea, like they’re not going to look.)
 Two-Sided Printing: For printers that can handle such a requirement.
 Paper Type/Quality: Clues the printer in on the type of paper you
loaded (such as inkjet, transparency film, brochure.) You also get to
choose the print quality. A fast draft uses less ink than printing in the
spiffiest, or best, quality. If your printer has more than one tray (for
example, a main tray and a photo tray), you can also choose the source
of the paper to use.
 Borderless Printing: Tell your printer to print without borders. Or not.
This seems as good a time as any to drop in on System Preferences, which is
under the Ú menu. Under the Hardware section, click the Print & Fax icon. As
you can see in Figure 8-4, three tabs appear: Printing, Faxing, and Sharing. I’ll
touch on Faxing later in this chapter.
Figure 8-4:

Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 

If you click the Printing tab, you can choose a default paper size, click the
Print Queue button to check the status of any current printing jobs, and
more. If you click the Sharing tab, you can designate which of your other
computers can share a particular printer.
Previewing your print
Before you waste ink and paper on an ill-advised print job, you probably want
to be sure your documents meet your lofty standards. That means the mar-
gins and spacing look jiffy and you have a clean layout with no widows. That’s
publishing-speak for a lonely word or two on a line of text all to itself.
The Mac lets you take a sneak peek. Click the Preview button in the sheet
that appears when you click Print in TextEdit. In Microsoft Word or other pro-
grams, you can choose File➪Print Preview to see a version of what you are
about to print. Word also gives you a preview in a small window that appears
in the Word print sheet.
If you’re satisfied, press Ô+P. If not, go back and apply the necessary changes
to your documents.
One more nice thing about printing on your Mac: The various programs you
work in give you lots more custom printing options. For example, you can
print a CD jewel case insert in iTunes (Chapter 14) or a pocket address book
in Address Book.
When Printers Stop Printing
As sure a thing as you’ll get in computing is that sooner or later (but proba-
bly sooner) your printer will let you down. I’ve already hinted at why.
Running out of ink or toner
Ink is perishable. Especially with an inkjet printer. The symptoms will be
obvious. The characters on a page get lighter and lighter each time you print,
to the point where they become barely legible. The software that came with
your printer may give you an estimate on how much ink you have left each
time you print. You can also check supply levels in the Print Queue, found
again by clicking the Printing tab under the Print & Fax section of System
Preferences.
127
Chapter 8: Printing and Faxing

Running out of paper
Unless you make a habit of peeking at your printer’s paper tray, you won’t get
a fair warning when your paper supply is exhausted. Of course, the rule of
thumb is that you will run out of paper the hour before an important term
paper is due (or legal brief or journalism deadline; feel free to insert your
own catastrophe).
Click the Supplies button in the TextEdit print sheet (and other print sheets).
It whisks you off to the Apple store on the Internet, where you can buy
replacement ink cartridges and paper. Because Tiger knows the kind of
printer you have, you won’t have to waste your time locating the requisite
supplies. Tiger serves as your personal shopper, ushering you to the correct
aisle in the store. If you have, say, an HP printer, Tiger will find the cartridges
compatible with your particular printer model.
Alternatively, click Supplies for This Printer in the Print & Fax section of
System Preferences.
Wherever you buy your ink and paper, I recommend having a spare set
around.
Sometimes a printer stops working for no apparent good reason. In the Print
Queue, try clicking Resume or Start Jobs. If all else fails, turn off and restart
your printer.
128
Part II: Mac Daily Dealings 
Digital longevity?
Does the paper you buy make a difference?
Some experts believe it does. Scientists main-
tain that the ink and paper combination you use
to print digital photographs has a major effect
on how the images will endure through the
decades. Wilhelm Imaging Research has con-
ducted accelerated aging tests that have indi-
cated that, even on the same printer, prints
made on high-quality paper could last more
than 70 years when exposed to light, as com-
pared to just two or three years using inferior
paper. Regardless of the paper you use, you can
bolster the lifespan of printed photographs by
keeping them from light, humidity, and cigarette
smoke and other pollutants.

Hooking Up a Scanner
As with printers, connecting a scanner is no big deal. It usually hooks up
through USB, though FireWire models are in the marketplace as well. Or you
may gain a scanner as part of a multifunction, or all-in-one, device.
Scanners are kind of anti-printers because you already have a printed image
that you want to reproduce on your computer screen, such as receipts, news-
paper clippings, or photo slides and negatives. Standalone scanners may cost
less than $50, though you pay a lot more as you add features.
If you click Scanner in the Print Queue, you can tinker with the software pro-
vided by your scanner manufacturer. The software may let you remove dust
or scratches from an image and restore faded colors.
Turning the Mac into a Fax Machine
If you bought a Mac with a built-in, dial-up fax modem (see Chapter 9), you
don’t need a dedicated fax machine. Just connect a telephone cord to the
Mac’s modem jack and you’re all set. Unfortunately, the dial-up modem is no
longer standard on the latest Macs. Instead, it’s a $49 USB add-on.
Sending a fax
If you have the Apple modem, you’ll appreciate the convenience of computer
faxing. You don’t have to print a document and go to the trouble of feeding a
dedicated fax machine. Instead, you dispatch faxes directly from any program
with printing capabilities.
1. Open the document you want to fax.
2. Chose File➪Print.
3. Click the PDF button and choose Fax PDF from the pop-up menu.
A sheet such as the one shown in Figure 8-5 appears.
129
Chapter 8: Printing and Faxing

4. In the To field, type the fax number of the person to whom you want
to send the fax, including 1 and the area code.
If necessary to access an outside line, add a dialing prefix such as 9 in
the box marked as such.
Alternatively, chose an entry from your Address Book by clicking the
shadowy silhouette icon to the right of the To field and then double-
clicking the card of the contact to whom you want to fax.
5. In the Modem box, select Internet Modem (or whatever) as the means
for dispatching your fax.
6. If you want a cover page, select the Use Cover Page option and type a
subject line and brief message.
7. If you click the pop-up menu that says Fax Cover Page, you can choose
other options to schedule the delivery of your fax or alter the layout.
8. To review the fax before sending it, click the Preview button.
9. Click the Fax button.
You should hear that awful, grinding faxing sound. It’s the best evidence
that your fax is on its merry way.
Receiving a fax
It makes sense that if a Mac can send a fax, it can receive one too. Make sure
you have an available phone line and your computer is awake. A Mac in sleep
mode cannot receive a fax. Then follow these steps:
Figure 8-5:

1. From System Preferences, choose Print & Fax and then click the
Faxing tab.
2. Select the Receive Faxes on This Computer option.
3. Type your fax number in the box, as shown in Figure 8-6.
3. Designate the number of rings before the fax is answered.
Make sure the computer gets to pick up before an answering machine
connected to the same phone line.
4. Choose how you want the incoming fax to be treated:
• Save the fax as a PDF in the Shared Faxes folder that Apple sug-
gests, or save it to another folder
• Send the fax to a specific e-mail address
• Automatically print the fax
You can accept an incoming fax even if you haven’t bothered to set up the
system to receive faxes automatically. Go to System Preference, choose Print &
Fax, and click Faxing. Select the box Show Fax Status in Menu Bar option.
When the phone rings, choose Answer Now from the Fax Status icon in the

emember what life was like prior to the middle half of the 1990s? Before
this nebulous thing called the Internet changed only everything.
Way back in the Dark Ages people routinely set foot in record stores to buy
music. Students went to the library to do research. Folks paid bills with
checks and read newspapers on, gosh, paper. They even picked up the tele-
phone to gab with friends.
How passé.
Nowadays, such transactions and exchanges occur gazillions of times a
second on the Internet. Cyberspace has become the place to shop, meet your
soul mate, and conduct business. It is also a virtual playground for the kids.
You can fetch, or download, computer software, movies, and all kinds of other
goodies. You may even get the stuff for free. Let your guard down, however,
and you can also lose your shirt. (You really have to question how you won
the Sri Lankan lottery when you never bought a ticket.)
Nobody in the early days of the Internet could have envisioned such a future.
What eventually morphed into the Net was invented by the nerds of their day,
1960s Defense Department scientists. They constructed — in the interest of
national security — the mother of all computer networks.

Hundreds of thousands of computers would be interconnected with hun-
dreds of thousands more. The friendly face of cyberspace — what became
the World Wide Web, or Web for short — was still decades away.
Has this somehow passed you by? Forget about fretting if you haven’t
boarded the cybershuttle just yet. Getting up to speed on the Internet isn’t as
daunting as you might think. You can enjoy a perfectly rewarding online expe-
rience through your Mac without ever deciphering the Net’s most puzzling
terms, everything from domain names to file transfer protocols. And you cer-
tainly don’t have to stay up late cramming for any final exams.
But the Internet is not for people who cherish siestas either. It’s as addictive
as nicotine. Expect a warning from the surgeon general any day now:
Spending time online is hazardous to your sleep cycle.
Feeling brave? Want to take the online plunge anyhow? The rest of this chap-
ter will clue you in on how best to proceed.
Dialing In
Let the games begin. You can find your way online in two main ways, and
both involve getting chummy with an important piece of computer circuitry,
the modem. I address dialup modems here and broadband modems in the
next section.
Dialup is the simplest and cheapest scheme. It’s nearly as brainless as making
a phone call. Wait a second, it is making a phone call. When the modem
works its magic, it dials the Internet over a regular phone line as if you were
calling your mother. The difference is that no one at the other end will make
you feel guilty for not visiting often enough. With any luck, you won’t get a
busy signal, either.
In many cases you won’t actually see the modem because it resides inside
the Mac. That’s okay. You only need to locate the phone jack on the back or
side of the computer (depending on the model). A little phone icon lets you
know you’ve arrived at the right place. On recent Macs, a built-in dialup
modem is no longer standard, probably because Apple reckons that most
users are embracing broadband; you can buy an optional dialup modem that
connects to a USB port on the machine. Either way, connect one end of a
standard phone cord into the modem jack and the other end into the wall
jack where your telephone was connected.
136
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

This all sounds fine and dandy, save one knotty problem. You still want to be
able to make and receive regular calls using the phone whose cord you
removed. The answer is a small, inexpensive, plastic doodad called a splitter
(or Y-jack), which as its name suggests splits a single phone jack into two. So
now you can plug your computer and phone into the same wall jack, though
you still can’t handle regular calls and use the Internet at the same time.
If doing both simultaneously is an essential requirement, you can always
have the phone company come out to install a second phone line in your
house. You can then dedicate one line to the modem and another to the
phone. This peachy little arrangement will cost you a pretty penny each
month, however, and is not necessarily the ideal solution, as I expand on in
the next section. It’s time to consider broadband.
Taking the Broadband Express
If the traditional dialup modem is the local, broadband is the express. Who
can blame you for wanting to take the fast train? You’ll pay more for a ticket —
monthly charges can amount to $35 to $50 on up, often more than double the
dialup fees. The positive spin is that you won’t need a second phone line.
Besides, the broadband express is almost always worth it. After you’ve experi-
enced a fast hookup, you’ll have a difficult time giving it up.
137
Chapter 9: Stairway to the Internet
Speed kills
When geeks speak of modem speeds, they typ-
ically talk in terms of kilobits per second, or
kbps, which is the equivalent of one thousand
bits per second. The itty bit or binary digit is the
tiniest unit of measurement for data. Dialup
modems are typically rated at 56 Kbps (often
expressed as 56K). Reality check: Rarely are the
maximum speeds achieved, so a 56K modem is
probably transmitting data at 48K or so. If you
don’t have a clean connection, you might creep
along at much slower speeds than that. You’ll be
counting “one Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi” and so on before the Web
page you clicked on even starts to show up.
Now consider broadband modems. The ones
that truly rock might blaze along at 5000kbps or
faster (sometimes expressed as 5 megabits per
second, or 5 Mbps.) The broadband to dialup
difference is like comparing an Olympic sprinter
to a weekend jogger. Web pages can turn up
thisfast, downloaded files also show up in a jiffy,
and videos appear much more fluid, as if you
were watching TV rather than viewing the
equivalent of a herky-jerky slide show.

DSL or cable?
Broadband service comes in three flavors. Depending on where you live, you
may have a choice of all, some, or none of the various alternatives. All three
broadband types have dedicated modems that reside outside the computer.
In many but not all cases, a technician will come to your house (generally for
a fee) and connect a broadband modem to the service you have selected. The
options are
 Cable modem: Typically the fastest of the broadband choices and the
one that probably makes the most sense if you already subscribe to
cable TV. The reason is your cable company is likely to cut you a small
break on the monthly fee. The connection involves hooking up the cable
TV cord to the modem.
 DSL: As with dialup, DSL, which stands for Digital Subscriber Line, works
over existing telephone lines. But a big difference compared to dialup is
that you can prowl the Internet and make or receive phone calls at the
same time. And DSL, like a cable modem, is leagues faster than a dialup
modem. As with cable, deals can be had if you take on service from the
same company supplying your regular phone service.
 Satellite: Possibly the only alternative if you live in the boondocks. You
get the Internet signal the same way you receive satellite TV, through a
dish or antenna mounted on your house. If you go the satellite route,
make sure your modem can send, or upload, information as well as
receive, or download, it. Upload speeds are typically much pokier than
download speeds, and satellite service in general is sluggish compared
to other broadband choices. (Of course, uploading and downloading are
components of all modem types.) Satellite also commands higher
upfront costs than cable or DSL because you have to shell out for the
dish and other components.
Always on, always connected
In the dialup world, you make your call, wait for a connection to be estab-
lished, grab what you are looking for on the Net, and say adios. Heaven forbid
you forget something. Each time you want to go back online, you have to
repeat this drill. Amounts to too many phone calls, too many hassles.
Broadband generally has fewer hang-ups. The experience is far more liberat-
ing because you have a persistent, always-on connection, at least as long as
the Mac itself is turned on. You won’t have to compete with your teenagers for
access to the only phone in the house. Web pages get updated. E-mails and
instant messages usually arrive in a blink. What’s more, you can share your
Internet connection with other computers in the house (see Chapter 19).
138
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Let Me In
This whole Internet business has one more essential piece: deciding on the
outfit that will let you past the Net’s front gate. That company is called an
Internet Service Provider, ISP for short. You’ll invariably have to slip this gate-
keeper a few bucks each month, though sometimes paying annually lowers
the price of admission. Many ISPs, such as AOL, Comcast, EarthLink, and
MSN, are large, well-known enterprises. But tiny unfamiliar companies may
also serve the bill.
As always, there are exceptions: You may not have to shop for an ISP if your
employer provides the Internet gratis. Students often get complimentary
access on college campuses, though the costs are likely buried in tuition.
If you signed up for broadband, chances are you’ve already met your ISP
because it’s the cable or phone company that set you up. But if you’re play-
ing one company off against another, here are key points to consider:
 Service: An ISP’s reputation is the whole enchilada. Seek companies that
do a lot of handholding, from Getting Started pamphlets to toll-free tech-
nical-support phone numbers. If they do provide toll-free support, give
the number a try before you sign up. Look elsewhere if it takes forever
for a live person to answer your call.
 Fees: Membership fees vary, and companies often run promotions.
Compare rate options if you live in a town with lots of dialup and broad-
band choices. Choose a plan in which you are given unlimited access for
a generous chunk of hours. Metered pricing in which you are billed
hourly isn’t smart for anyone but the most disciplined user who rarely
expects to go online.
 Local number: This is an important consideration for dialup customers.
If possible, choose a plan where you can dial the Net without incurring
long-distance charges. If you travel a lot, it’s also helpful to have a
choice of local numbers in the city or cities you most often frequent.
 E-mail: Just for being a customer, some ISPs give you one or more e-mail
accounts. More is obviously better if you intend on sharing the com-
puter with family members. Ask also whether the ISP provides tools for
cutting down on spam. I’ll have more to say on this topic in Chapter 10.
 Family protection: If you have kids, find out whether the ISP offers
parental controls or takes other steps to help protect the little ones in
cyberspace.
139
Chapter 9: Stairway to the Internet

140
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 
Whither online services
America Online remains the colossus of ISPs, but
it also is the prime representative of a crumbling
institution: the online service as we once knew
it. (An online service is essentially a private club
where you can pontificate in chat rooms and on
bulletin boards, download files, get news, seek
help with technical problems, and access
e-mail.) In the days when only nerds had heard
of the Internet, AOL competed against and ulti-
mately clobbered consumer rivals such as
Prodigy and more technically oriented online
services such as CompuServe and GEnie. In fact,
AOL eventually acquired CompuServe.
As with any ISP, subscribers today rely on AOL
as the gateway to the unfettered Internet. But
you also must fork over a premium for the privi-
lege. At $25.90 a month for an unlimited plan,
you’d be hard-pressed to find a more expensive
dialup alternative.
Throngs of members, including lots of Net
beginners, or newbies, made AOL the online
champ because of the way the company clev-
erly prepackaged and organized material inside
its “walled garden.” Sure, you could eventually
venture out to the Internet at large, but more
than likely you’d remain inside AOL’s friendly
confines. The environment was pretty safe —
AOL offered excellent parental controls and
tried to rid the joint of its relatively few bad
apples. The company also made it a breeze to
get started. AOL’s free software disks turned up
in shops, in your mailbox, and as magazine
inserts.
In recent years, though, AOL members started
ditching the service in droves. Folks discovered
broadband and figured that much of what they
were getting inside AOL for hefty fees, they
could find on their own in cyberspace for less. It
hardly mattered to these people that AOL ped-
dled broadband connect services like its rivals.
They couldn’t care less that AOL reduced the
tab for its proprietary content when they arrived
online through another ISP. Bottom line: AOL
became less relevant.
AOL got the hint. It quietly transitioned from a
company that has traditionally trumpeted the
flagship online service into one that aggres-
sively competes in the free Web portal, or entry-
way space, against the likes of Yahoo!, MSN,
and Google. This means that much of the mate-
rial previously available only to subscribers can
be accessed for free by visitors to its Web
pages. What’s more, as of this writing, AOL
parent Time Warner was reportedly consider-
ing a plan that would drop subscription fees for
high-speed broadband customers. (Dial-up
members would still have to pay.) Such an
altered landscape begs an obvious question: Is
AOL membership worthwhile? A slew of AOL
critics sneer that AOL wasn’t worth the price of
admission even in its heyday. The reasons for
staying put are dwindling even for AOL loyalists.
Although AOL still provides fine parental con-
trols, most of the other PC protection and secu-
rity features it offers with a subscription mean
little to the Mac community. Viruses and spy-
ware are mostly somebody else’s problem (see
Chapter 14).
Still, Mac users will appreciate some of the con-
tent that remains solely available to AOL sub-
scribers, notably all XM satellite radio’s music
channels. Perhaps the most compelling reason
to stick with AOL: Veteran members may not
want to go through the hassle of telling friends
and cohorts that the AOL e-mail address they’ve
used for years is now out of service.

Going on a Safari
It is virtually impossible to ignore the World Wide Web. Practically everyone
you come across is caught up in the Web in one way or another. On a typical
day, you might hear how “little Johnny built this amazing Web page at
school.” How your best friend researched symptoms on the Web before head-
ing to the doctor. And how you can save a bundle booking your vacation
online. Web addresses are plastered on billboards, business cards, and the
cover of books like this one.
Just browsing
Technologists have an uncanny knack for making simple things hard. They
could ask you to make a phone call over the Internet. But if they told you
instead to make a VoIP or Voice over Internet Protocol call, they’d pretend to
be really smart. So it is unbelievably refreshing to discover that to browse or
surf the World Wide Web, you need a piece of software that is called, um, a
Web browser. Okay, so they might have called it a Web surfer.
Because you had the good sense to purchase a Mac, you are blessed with one
of the best browsers in the business. It’s aptly named Safari because much of
what you do in cyberspace is an expedition into the wild. See Figure 9-1.
Learning to tame Safari means getting fluent with the concept of a Web address,
or what those aforementioned technologists dub a URL (Uniform Resource
Locator). Scary stuff. I told you, these guys can’t seem to help themselves.
Just because of the way things are, all Web addresses begin with http:// or
www. and end with a suffix, typically .com (pronounced “dotcom”), .edu, .gov,
.net, or .org. What you type in between is often (but not always) an excellent
indicator of where you will end up on the Web. So typing www.usatoday.
com takes you to the nation’s largest newspaper. Typing www.espn.com
leads to a popular sports destination. And so on. You enter the URL into an
address box at the top of the browser window (labeled in Figure 9-1).
141
Chapter 9: Stairway to the Internet

Clicking links
Web surfing would be awfully tedious if you had to type an address each time
you wanted to go from one site to another. Fortunately, the bright minds who
invented Safari and other browsers agree.
On the Safari address bar you’ll typically see a series of buttons or icons to
the left of the box where you entered the URL. The buttons you see and the
order in which they appear vary, depending on how you customize the
browser. To make the address bar disappear entirely, choose View➪Hide
Address Bar. To make it reappear, choose View➪Show Address bar.
The left- and right-facing arrow buttons on the address bar function as the
back and forward buttons, respectively. So clicking the left arrow transports

you back to the last page you were looking at before the page that is cur-
rently displayed. Click the right, or forward, button to advance to a page you
have already looked at.
Click the address bar icon that looks like a house, and you go to your starting
base, or home page. That’s the site that greets you each time you fire up the
browser for the first time. It’s no coincidence that Apple chose one of its own
Web pages as the default Safari starting point. That way, it can promote the
company and try to sell you stuff. As you might imagine, home pages are
valuable pieces of screen real estate to marketers. Everyone from AOL to
Google to Yahoo! would love for you to choose their portal as your start page.
Fortunately, changing Safari’s home page is simple. Select Preferences from
the Safari menu, click the General tab, and then type the Web address of your
page of choice in the box labeled Home page, shown in Figure 9-2.
You’ll notice that some text on various Web pages is underlined in blue. That
means it’s a link. Clicking a link takes you to another page without having to
type any other instructions.
Some links are genuinely useful. If you are reading about the Indianapolis
Colts game, you may want to click a link that would lead to, say, quarterback
Peyton Manning’s career statistics. But be wary of other links that are merely
come-ons for advertisements.

Using bookmarks
Odds are you’ll rapidly get hooked on a bevy of juicy Web pages that become
so irresistible you’ll keep coming back for more. We won’t ask, you need not
tell. Of course it’s downright silly to have to remember and type the destina-
tion’s Web address each time you return. Create a bookmark instead.
Choose the Add Bookmark item under Safari’s Bookmarks menu or press the
keyboard shortcut Ô+D. A dialog box appears (see Figure 9-3), asking you to
type a name for the bookmark you have in mind and to choose a place to
keep it for handy reference later. You can group bookmarks in menu folders
called Collections. If you decide to bookmark the Internet Movie Database
home page, for example, you might decide to place it in a Collections folder
called Entertainment. Whenever you want to pay a return visit to the site, you
open the Entertainment folder and click the bookmark.

Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Despite your best organizational skills, your list of bookmarks and
Collections may become so, well, overbooked, that it becomes far less func-
tional. I practically guarantee that you will tire of at least some of the sites
now cluttering up your bookmarks closet. To delete a bookmark, highlight its
name, click the Edit menu at the top of the screen, and then choose Cut. If
you change your mind, choose Edit➪Undo Delete Bookmark.
If all that seems like too much work, highlight an unwanted bookmark and
press the Delete button on your keyboard.
You’ll want to return to some sites so often they deserve VIP status. Reserve
a spot for them in Safari’s Bookmarks marquee, otherwise known as the book-
marks bar, situated below the browser’s address bar. Choose Bookmarks Bar
when the dialog box pops up, asking where to place the bookmark you’ve just
created.
Employing the tools of the 
trade on your Safari
Safari is capable of other neat tricks. I describe some of them in this section.
Pop-up blocker
Tolerating Web advertising is the price to pay for all the rich Web resources
at your disposal. Problem is, some ads induce agita. The most offensive are
pop-ups, those hiccupping nightmarish little windows that make you think
you woke up in the middle of the Las Vegas strip. Pop-ups have the audacity
to get between you and the Web page you are attempting to read. Turning on
the pop-up blocker can shield you from such pollutants. Click Block Pop-Up
Windows under the Safari menu or employ the keyboard shortcut Ô+K. If a
check appears, you have successfully completed your mission. Once in a
great while, a pop-up is worth viewing; to turn off the pop-up blocker simply
repeat this exercise.
Google search bar
You can conduct a Google search by visiting www.google.com. But Safari
saves you the time and trouble. You can enter search terms directly into a
box right in the address bar. I’ll have more to say about Google and other
search engines later in this chapter.
145
Chapter 9: Stairway to the Internet

Filling out forms
Safari can remember your name, address, passwords, and other information.
So when you start typing a few characters into a Web form or other field, the
browser can finish entering the text for you, provided it finds a match in its
database. From the Safari menu, choose Preferences➪AutoFill, and select the
items you want Safari to use (such as info from your Address Book card). If
several choices match the first several letters you type in a form, a menu
appears. Press the arrow keys to select the item you have in mind and then
press Enter.
Tabbed browsing
Say you want to peek at several Web pages in a single browser window
instead of having to open separate windows for each “open” page. Welcome
to the high art of tabbed browsing. To turn on the feature, choose Preferences
in the Safari menu and then click Tabs. The window shown in Figure 9-4
appears. Select the Enabled Tabbed Browsing option and the Select New Tabs
As They Are Created option. Then close the Preferences window.
Now each time you Ô-click, you open a link in a new tab instead of a window.
To toggle from one open Web page to another, just click its tab. The tabs
appear just under the bookmarks bar. You can also press Ô+T to open a new
tabbed window.
Benefiting from History
Say you failed to bookmark a site and now days later decide to return. Only
you can’t remember what the darn place was called or the convoluted path
that brought you there. Become a history major. Safari logs every Web page
you open and keeps the record for a week or so. So you can consult the
History menu to view a list of all the sites you visited on a particular day
during the week. If you’re wigged out by this Internet trail, you can always
click Clear History to wipe the slate clean.

Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Private browsing
Hey maybe you do have something to hide. Perhaps you’re surfing in an
Internet cafe. Or just possibly you’re being paranoid. Whatever. Turn on a
hush-hush Safari feature called private browsing by choosing that option on
the Safari menu. Now Safari won’t add the Web pages you’ve visited to the
History menu (though you can still use the Back and Forward buttons to
return to sites you’ve been to). When private browsing is turned on, AutoFill
is turned off, and Web cookie preferences (see Chapter 14) are also deep-
sixed.
Using an Alternative Browser
Safari is swell, but it’s not the only game in town. Eventually, you’ll stumble
upon a Web site that doesn’t make nice with the Apple browser. That’s likely
because the site was programmed to work solely with the Grand Poobah
among browsers, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. Hey, no one ever said life was
fair (see the “Putting up with Internet Explorer” sidebar).
Other fine browsers abound and choosing one is like deciding between Coke
and Pepsi. Check out Mozilla Firefox, iCab, and Opera at their respective Web
sites.
147
Chapter 9: Stairway to the Internet
Putting up with Internet Explorer
For years Microsoft adopted a kind of laissez-
faire approach when it came to revving up its
famed Web browser. It generally left tabbed
browsing and other innovations to others. Such
is the complacency that sets in when you’ve
bagged a monopolistic share of the market. Still
the venerable browser comes in handy at times,
especially if Safari has difficulty communicating
with a particular Web page you’re trying to
view. On older Macs, you’ll find Internet
Explorer in the Applications folder. On newer
systems, you have to fetch the program yourself
from the Internet.
Just don’t expect any niceties from the folks at
Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
In the middle of 2003, Microsoft announced that
IE for the Mac would undergo no further devel-
opment. A couple of years later, Microsoft said
it would no longer offer tech support for the
Mac version of IE and indicated it wouldn’t pro-
vide security or performance updates either.
The message was practically deafening: Go
book a Safari.

The Skinny on Search Engines
So all these plum pickings are on the Internet, along with quite a lot of
garbage. This leads to the obvious question: Where in goodness sakes do you
uncover the gems amidst all the junk? A search engine is the best place to
begin. These useful tools scan Web pages to find links based on instances of
the search terms you enter.
Google this
Anyone who is anyone — and that might as well include you — uses Google.
Google has become so popular that it’s often treated as a verb, as in, I googled
something. It is also why Google’s founders have become richer than Croesus.
Haven’t the foggiest idea who Croesus was? Just Google the name, and you’ll
soon discover how this sixth-century Lydian monarch managed to amass a
fortune without launching an IPO.
The slowpoke way to Google something is to visit www.google.com. Type
your search query, Croesus in this example, and click the Google Search
button. Safari, however, provides a faster alternative. Just enter your query in
the Google text box inside the Safari address bar, as shown in Figure 9-5.
Google text box
Figure 9-5:
A rich
search in
Google.
148
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Either way, Google will rapidly spit back a list of findings, or hits, containing
links to Web pages. That would be all there is to it, except you’ll probably
have to help Google narrow things down a tad. The Croesus example yields
about 503,000 hits, which is more than you probably bargained for.
Enter an even broader search term such as rockets, and Google responds with
something in the order of 45 million hits. I don’t know about you, but I have
time to pore through only half of them. What’s more, smart as Google is, it
has no way of knowing whether you mean the flying machine that soars into
outer space, the basketball franchise that plays in Houston, or even the ham-
burger chain Johnny Rockets.
The obvious takeaway: the more descriptive you are the better. Two or three
search terms almost always work better than one.
You can assist Google in several ways. Putting quotation marks around your
search term narrows the returns because the browser thinks you’re search-
ing for that exact phrase. This works wonders with song or book titles.
Conversely, you can exclude topic areas by putting a minus sign next to the
word. For example, if you enter
rockets –houston
you shouldn’t receive references to the basketball team. If you want to find
pages that include either of two search queries, use an OR between the
words. For example
Rockets OR Jets
displays results for two professional sports franchises. But proving again
how tricky the search biz can be, you would have to be more explicit if the
rockets and jets you have in mind are the kind that require astronauts and
pilots.
Here’s a sampling of other nifty Google tricks that would make a professional
researcher proud:
 Solve arithmetic: Enter a math problem, such as 63/7.8 = and Google
supplies the answer (8.07692308).
 Provide the forecast: By adding weather next to a city name or postal
zip code, you can peek at the current temperature, wind, and humidity
and get a quick weather snapshot of the days ahead.
 Do a reverse phone lookup: Type an area code and a phone number,
and Google will reveal whose number it is (if listed).
 Track airline delays: Google can tell you whether a plane is on time.
Just type in the flight number.
149
Chapter 9: Stairway to the Internet

 Take over for Webster: Place define before a word and Google offers a
definition.
 Convert currency: Want to determine how many dollars there are to the
euro? Type, for example, 250 us dollars in euros.
MSN and Yahoo!
Google is the search engine of choice for your humble author, but other alterna-
tives are available. Yahoo! and MSN (from Microsoft) are probably the best-
known rivals, and both do a decent job. In fact, Yahoo! is kind of the granddaddy
of the search business. Moreover, when you go to the Yahoo! or MSN site, at
www.yahoo.com or www.msn.com, respectively, you’ll be taken to their respec-
tive Web portals, where you can do a lot more than search. Portals are launching
pads for a gaggle of goodies, including news and entertainment links, stock
quotes, games, and e-mail.
The Davids to the search Goliaths
You may want to do a Google search on search engines because so many
smaller, specialized ones pop up all the time. (I suppose the creators of these
sites want entrée into the same country clubs as the Google guys.) Search
companies may narrowly focus on news, health, travel, local goings-on, poli-
tics, or shopping. And some, such as Dogpile (www.dogpile.com), merely
aggregate or compile results from other leading search engines into one.
A particularly interesting approach is taken by Clusty, found at
www.clusty.com. It groups similar items together into folders, or clusters. If
you type Giants, for example, Clusty generates groupings such as New York
Giants, San Francisco Giants, Barry Bonds, Corporate Giants, Dinosaurs, and
Land of the Giants. Click the appropriate cluster, and the displayed search
results pertain only to that grouping.

In This Chapter
 Setting up e-mail accounts
 Composing messages
 Receiving messages
 Dealing with attachments
 Handling junk mail
 Getting tutored on smart mailboxes
E
lectronic mail is a blessing and a curse.
Why you can’t live without e-mail: Messages typically reach the person to
whom they’re addressed in a few seconds as compared with a few days for
snail mail. (That’s the pejorative label geeks have tattooed on regular postal
mail.) You won’t waste time licking envelopes either.
Why e-mail drives you batty: It won’t take long before you’re likely buried
under an avalanche of messages, much of it junk mail, or spam.
Not that any mail system is perfect. You can only imagine the snide com-
ments heard in the day of the Pony Express: Love that I got my tax refund and
Sharper Image catalogue, but the stench on that steed. . . .
If you’re an e-mail tyro, you discover the basics in this chapter. But even
those who have been sending electronic missives for years might be able to
collect a useful nugget or two.

Understanding E-Mail
In broad terms, e-mail is the exchange of messages over a communications
network, typically the Internet but also a network within an organization.
To use e-mail, you need an e-mail account, such as the ones traditionally
offered by employers, schools, or Internet Service Providers (ISPs) such as
AOL, EarthLink, or MSN. You also need e-mail software to send, receive, and
organize these messages. Fortunately, Apple includes such an application
with OS X, and there can’t be any doubt about what the program does. It’s
aptly named Mail.
To access Mail, single-click the icon that looks like a stamp on the dock. If for
some reason the icon isn’t there, double-click the Mail icon inside the
Applications folder.
By the way, don’t let the stamp representing the Mail icon fool you. E-mail
doesn’t require postage; for that matter, many e-mail accounts are free. Well,
like most things in life, e-mail is not really free. You pay for it
 As part of your ISP fees
 As part of your college tuition
 By having to read irritating online advertisements
 By the aggravation accompanying your boss’s e-mails
The Worldwide E-Mail Exchange
Before telling you how to set up e-mail accounts to work with the Mac’s Mail
program, know that you can continue to send and read mail inside such
applications as Microsoft Entourage (like Outlook for the Mac crowd). What’s
more, if you’ve been sending and receiving e-mail on other computers
through Web accounts such as Google’s Gmail, Microsoft’s MSN Hotmail, or
Yahoo! Mail, you can continue right along on the Mac. AOL, the outfit that
popularized the phrase “You’ve Got Mail,” works too.
Having one or more Web-based e-mail accounts is nice. You get the tremen-
dous advantage of being able to access mail from any Internet browser (on a
Mac or PC). Plus, popular Web e-mail accounts are free and loaded with gobs
of storage.
152
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Setting Up a New E-Mail Account
Sending and reading e-mail through the Mac’s Mail program is a breeze, after
you set the thing up. Indeed, the process for first-timers can be a slightly har-
rowing experience:
1. Open Mail by clicking the Mail icon (it looks like a stamp) on the dock
or by double-clicking Mail in the Applications folder.
You are greeted with a Welcome to Mail window, shown in Figure 10-1.
2. Click Continue.
3. Fill in the General Information required in the next screen.
You must fill in an Account Type (from a drop-down menu), Account
Description, Full Name, User Name, and Password.
4. In the next few screens, you have to supply other dreadful sounding
particulars, such as the name of the incoming mail server (something
like pop.yourprovider.com).
This is where your e-mail congregates before it is retrieved. There’s also
the outgoing mail server (typically SMTP.yourprovider.com). Okay, I
won’t keep you in the dark any longer: SMTP stands for Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol, POP is short for Post Office Protocol, and IMAP for
Internet Mail Access Protocol or Internet Message Access Protocol.
Figure 10-1:
Setting up a
new Mail
account
begins here.
153
Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

Setting up additional mail accounts involves repeating these steps. Begin by
choosing File➪Add Account in Mail.
Piece of advice: Unless you’re looking for an excuse to get away from the
chatterbox you’ve been kibitzing with at a cocktail reception, avoid dropping
these unfriendly terms into your conversation. It’s like having a big N (as in
Nerd) stamped to your forehead.
If the IMAPs and SMTPs and the rest are not exactly at your fingertips (and
why should they be?), call your ISP or poke around the company’s Web site
for assistance.
Incidentally, setting up e-mail through a .Mac account (see Chapter 12) is a
far simpler endeavor because Apple fills in some of the blanks on your behalf.
Before You Click Send
I promise the difficult part is behind you. And if you’re already an e-mail whiz,
you can skip the next few sections. I’ll greet you on the other side.
If you’re still with me, you’re going to find out how to send e-mail, with minimal
attention paid to protocol. E-mail addresses always have the @ symbol some-
where in their midst. They look something like this: paula@americanidol.
com, deputyfife@mayberrysheriff.gov, or costanza@nyyankees.com.
With the Mail program open, choose File➪New Message, use the keyboard
alternative Ô+N, or click New in the Mail toolbar. (Once again, if Mail isn’t
open, click the stamp icon on the dock.) A window like the one shown in
Figure 10-2 appears.
Addressing your missive
With the New Message window on your screen, you’re ready to begin the
process of communicating through e-mail with another human being.
In the To box, carefully type the recipient’s e-mail address. If you type even a
single letter, number, or symbol incorrectly, your message will not be sent
(you should get a bounce-back notification) or worse, will be dispatched to
the wrong person.
154
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

As you start banging out an e-mail address, the Mac tries to be helpful. It fills
in the name and address of the person it thinks you are trying to reach
(culled from your Address Book). Don’t worry if the wrong name shows up at
first. Keep typing until either Apple guesses correctly or you have manually
entered the full address.
If you are sending mail to more than one recipient, separate the addresses
with a comma.
If you want to send mail to folks who are not the primary addressees of your
letter, type the addresses for these people (again separated by commas if you
have more than one) in the Cc:, or carbon copy, box.

Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

There’s an even easier way to add an e-mail address, provided your recipient
already resides in your Address Book. In the New Message window, click the
Address button. Then just double-click the name of the person from your
Address Book who you want to send mail to, and the Mail program takes care
of the rest. The real names of these Address Book people appear in the To
box (or cc box); you won’t see their actual e-mail address. For example, you’d
see the name Tony Soprano rather than boss@sopranos.com. Have no
fear, under the hood, Apple is making all the proper arrangements to send
your message to the rightful recipient.
You may want to keep the recipients’ list confidential. (The Feds need not know
where all Tony’s mail goes.) There are a couple of ways to accomplish this:
 You can send mail to a Group in your Address Book (Chapter 3) just by
typing the Group name in the To field. Mail then automatically routes
mail to each member’s e-mail address. To keep those addresses private,
choose Mail➪Preferences and select Composing. Make sure the “When
Sending to a Group, Show All Member Addresses” option is not checked.
 To keep the addresses of recipients who are not members of the same
group private, click the little drop-down arrow to left of the Account box
in the New Message window. Choose Bcc Address Field. Bcc stands for
blind carbon copy. Everyone included in the list will get the message, but
they won’t have a clue who else you sent it to.
Composing messages
Keep a few things in mind before pounding out a message. Although optional,
it’s good e-mail etiquette to type a title, or Subject, for your e-mail. (See the
“E-mail etiquette” sidebar.) In fact, some people get right to the point and
blurt out everything they have to say in the Subject line (for example, Lunch
is on at noon).
To write your message, just start typing in the large area provided below the
address, subject, and account lines. You can also paste passages (or pic-
tures) cut or copied from another program.
The standard formatting tools found with your word processor are on hand.
You can make words bold or italic and add spice to the letters through fancy
fonts. Click the Fonts button to display different typefaces. Click the Colors
button to alter the hues of your individual characters. Both the Font window
and the color wheel are shown in Figure 10-3.
156
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

You’re almost there. But what if you’re waiting to insert an updated sales
figure? Or decide it wouldn’t be a bad idea to let off a bit of steam before sub-
mitting your resignation (via the cold harsh world of e-mail)? Click the Save
as Draft button and do whatever it is you do to calm down. When you’re
ready to resume working on the message, demanding a raise instead, choose
Mailbox➪Go To, and click Drafts. Or press Ô+3.
Attaching files
You can attach a payload to your e-mail. Attachments are typically word pro-
cessing documents, but they can be any type of file: pictures, music, spread-
sheets, videos, and more.
To send a file with your e-mail, click the Attach button. In the window that
appears, select the file you have in mind from the appropriate folder on your
hard drive.
Figure 10-3:

fonts and

157
Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

Given the market dominance of that other operating system, it’s a fair bet
you’re sending attachments to a Windows user. Windows is particular about
the files it can read. It wants to see the file extension, such as .doc (see Chapter
7). Because Apple apparently wants to play nice with the rest of the computing
public, all you need to do is check the box that reads Send Windows Friendly
Attachments before sending an attachment to a Windows pal.
Windows users may receive two attachments when you send mail from a
Mac. (And you coulda sworn you sent a single file.) One reads “TheNameofthe
FileISent” and the other “._TheNameoftheFileISent.” Your recipients can safely
can ignore the latter.
You’ll make everyone happy if you clue recipients in ahead of time if you’re
planning on sending them large files, particularly high-resolution images and
video. And by all means refer to the attachment in the message you send. You
should do for a couple of reasons.
 Many Windows viruses are spread through e-mail attachments. Although
you know the files are harmless, your Windows pals may be understand-
ably skittish about opening a file without a clear explanation of what
you’re sending. Mac users have managed to avoid such headaches.
 Sending oversized attachments can slow down or even clog your recipi-
ent’s e-mail inbox. It can take him or her forever to download these files.
Moreover, ISPs may impose restrictions on the amount of e-mail storage
users can have in their inboxes or in the size of a file that can trans-
ported. The company you work for may enforce its own limits. In fact
some employers prevent staffers from sending messages (or replying to
yours) until they’ve freed up space by wiping out older messages and
attachments.
To get past an ISP’s size restrictions, Mail gives you the option to resize
images. Click the tiny pop-up menu at the bottom-right corner of the New
Message window, which shows up along with the image you are sending. The
menu appears in Figure 10-4.

Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Spell checking
There’s a certain informality to e-mail. Rather than type a sentence that says,
“How are you?” you might instead type “How r u?” But not always.
Spelling counts (or ought to) when you are corresponding with potential
employers or, for that matter, the person currently responsible for your pay-
check. I know you won’t want to be reprimanded if you send e-mail with mis-
spellings to your seventh-grade English teacher.
Fortunately, Apple provides assistance to the spelling-challenged among us.
A spell checker is a basic feature.
To access the e-mail spell checker, choose Mail➪Preferences, and then click
Composing. Under the Check Spelling pop-up (see Figure 10-5), choose As I
Type, When I Click Send, or Never.
Assuming you ignored that last option, the Mail program will underline in red
what it thinks are misspelled words, just as TextEdit and other word processors
Figure 10-5:

(which you can access from the Mail menu). Right-click the suspect word and

Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 
E-Mail etiquette
If Emily Post were alive today, she would surely
draw up a list of acceptable practices for han-
dling e-mails. In her absence, permit me to
school you on e-mail decorum. I’ve already
mentioned a few proper conventions: It helps to
add a title or subject line to your e-mail and
warn people if you’re going to send large
attachments. In some instances, you’ll also
want to use Bcc to protect the anonymity of the
other people receiving your messages.
Here are some other conventions. DON’T SHOUT
BY USING ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. Typing in low-
ercase letters like these is much more civilized.
And you will avoid someone SHOUTING BACK
and deliberately insulting, or flaming, you.
Do not forward e-mail chain letters. They will
not bring you or your comrades vast riches. Or
good luck. On the contrary, chain letters have
been proven to cause people to stick needles in
voodoo dolls representing the person who
passed on the chain letter.
If replying to an e-mail, include the original
thread by clicking reply rather than composing
a new message from scratch. If the original
thread does not automatically show up (as is the
case with AOL mail), try this trick. Highlight the
pertinent passages (or all of) the incoming mes-
sage you want to respond to. When you click
Reply, the original text will be there. Tailor your
reply so the responses are right next to the orig-
inal queries.
Keep emoticons, such as : ) — a smiley face —
and text shortcuts, such as LOL (laugh out loud)
and IMHO (in my humble opinion), to a minimum.
You can use these more often when sending
instant messages, as I elaborate in the next
chapter.
In general, keep messages short and sweet.
Some people get hundreds of e-mails a day. If
you want your message to be among those that
are read, don’t compose an e-mail that is the
text equivalent of a filibuster.
Take care to ensure that the message is going to
the right place. Nothing’s worse than mistakenly
sending a message that says “Jack is a jerk” to
Jack. For that matter, think long and hard before
sending the “Jack is a jerk” memo to Jill.
E-mails have a life of their own. They can be
intentionally or accidentally forwarded to
others. Maybe Jill is on Jack’s side. (They’ve
been spotted together fetching a pale of water,
you know.) Maybe she thinks you are the jerk.
Along this line, remember that e-mails lack the
verbal or visual cues of other forms of commu-
nication. Maybe you were kidding all along
about Jack being a jerk. But will Jack know you
are merely pulling his chain? To make sure he
does know, this is one instance where it is per-
fectly acceptable to use a smiley.
In general, ask yourself how you’d feel receiv-
ing the same message. And don’t assume your
message will remain private. Think before send-
ing anything in an e-mail that you’d be reluctant
to say in public.
Ignore these suggestions at your own peril.
Somewhere Emily Post is watching.

If your spell checker keeps tripping over a word that is in fact typed correctly
(your company name, for instance), you can add it to the spell checker dic-
tionary. Control-click the word and select Learn Spelling from the pop-up list.
Your Mac should never make the same mistake again.
Signing off with a signature
You can personalize Mail with a signature plastered at the bottom of every
outgoing message. Along with your name, a signature might include your
snail mail address, phone number, iChat account name, and a pithy slogan.
To add your e-mail “John Hancock,” choose Mail➪Preferences. Click the
Signatures tab, and then click the Add (+) button. You can accept or type
over the default signature Apple suggests and choose whether to match the
font already used in the message.
Managing the Flood of Incoming Mail
The flip side of sending e-mail, of course, is having to sift through the mess of
messages that may come your way. You can spend hours trying get through
an e-mail inbox, depending on your line of work.
The little red balloon on the Mail icon on the dock indicates the number of
unread messages demanding your attention.
New e-mails arrive as a matter of course through the Internet. You can click
the Get Mail button on the Mail toolbar to hasten the process, as shown in
our little tour of the Mail program in Figure 10-6. Tiny status circles next to
each of your e-mail accounts spin until the number of messages in that
account pop up.
If you click the Get Mail button and nothing happens, make sure your account
isn’t offline (the account name appears dimmed). To remedy the situation,
choose Mailbox and then choose Go Online.
If that too fails to alleviate the problem, choose Window➪Connection Doctor.
It verifies that you’re connected to the Internet and examines each e-mail
account to make sure it’s properly configured.

Choosing what to read
I’m no censor. I’d never tell you what you should or should not read — online
or off. So know that I have only your best interests at heart when I urge you
to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism when it comes to tackling your
inbox.
As you pore through said inbox, you’ll probably notice mail from companies,
online clubs, or Web sites you might have expressed an interest in at one
time or another. You might have subscribed to e-mail newsletters on subjects
ranging from ornithology to orthodontrics. Most of the mail you get from
these outfits is presumably A-OK with you.
I’ll also take it as a given that you’re going to read all the e-mails you get from
colleagues, friends, and family. Well, maybe over time you’ll come to ignore
mail from Uncle Harry and Aunt Martha, especially if they insist on sending
you the lamest of joke lists. If your mother is now using e-mail to hassle you
about how you still aren’t married, you have permission to ignore those too.
Figure 10-7:

Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

That leaves e-mail from just about everyone else, and it likely falls into one of
three buckets. These categories fit most people’s definition of junk mail, or
spam:
 They’re trying to sell you something. If might be Viagra or Xanax. It
might be a (supposedly) cheap mortgage. It might be a small-cap growth
stock. It might be a Rolex. It probably means trouble.
 They’re trying to scam you. You have to ask yourself, why me? Of all the
deserving people on the planet, how is that you have been chosen by a
private international banking firm to collect a small fortune left by a rich
eccentric? Or the secret funds hidden by a deposed Third World diplo-
mat? This too will probably get you in a pickle. (In Chapter 13, I discuss
a special type of scam known as phishing.)
 They’re sending you pornography. It’s out there. In a major way.
Opening mail from strangers
What was it your parents taught you about not talking to strangers? That’s
generally sound advice with e-mail too. As I hinted at in the preceding section,
cyberspace has a lot of misfits, creeps, and (I knew I’d have to throw this
phrase somewhere in the book) bad apples. They’re up to no good. Because I
don’t want to cast aspersions on every unknown person who sends you
e-mail, go with your gut. Common sense applies.
You can learn a lot from the subject line. If it refers to someone you know or
what you do, I don’t see the harm in opening the message.
If the greeting is generic — Dear Wells Fargo Customer; Get Out of Debt Now —
I’d be a lot more cautious. Ditto if there’s no subject line or there are gross
misspellings.
If a sender turns out to be a decent business prospect or your new best
friend, you can always add him or her to your Address Book by choosing one
of the following alternatives.
 Choose Message➪Add Sender to Address Book.
 Right-click a sender’s name or address in the From line of a message and
select Add to Address Book. (If you have a one-button mouse, the alter-
native is Ctrl-click.)
A few other handy shortcuts appear when you right-click a sender’s name.
You can Copy the person’s Address, reply to the person, send him or her a
new message, create a smart mailbox (more on this later in this chapter) or
run an instant Spotlight search on the person.
164
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Junking the junk
If senders turn out to be bad news, you can sully their reputation. At least on
your own computer. Throw their mail into the junk pile. It’s easy: Just click
Junk on the message toolbar.
Marking messages happens to be your way of training the Mail program in
what you consider spam. Apple updates its databases accordingly. The com-
pany flags potentially objectionable mail by highlighting messages with a
brown tinge. Click Not Junk in the message if Apple applies the junk label to
the innocent.
You can direct Apple on how to handle the junk. Choose Mail➪Preferences,
and then click the Junk Mail tab. The screen shown in Figure 10-8 appears.
By default, the Mail program leaves junk mail in your inbox so that you get to
be the final arbiter. If you want Tiger to segregate suspect mail in its own
mailbox, click the Move It to the Junk Mailbox option.
As a matter of course, Apple exempts certain messages from spam filtering.
This includes mail from senders who are in your Address Book, as well as
senders who already received mail from you. Messages that use your full
name are also exempt. In the Junk Mail section of Mail Preferences, remove
the check mark next to any Mail preferences you want to change.
Most reputable ISPs attempt to fight spam on their own. If you’re satisfied
with the job they’re doing, leave the box “Trust junk mail headers set by my
Internet Service Provider” checked. Apple’s Mail program will leverage your
ISP’s best efforts.

Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

Tips for avoiding spam
You can do your part to eliminate spam too. Spammers are resourceful and
can get your e-mail address through various methods:
 They employ automated software robots to guess at nearly every possi-
ble combination of addresses.
 They watch what you’re doing. Do you fill out online sweepstakes forms?
There’s a winner, all right, the spammer.
 Do you hang out in chat rooms and Internet newsgroups? Bingo.
 Do you post messages in a public forum? Gotcha again.
You can stop engaging in these online activities, of course, but then the
Internet won’t be nearly as much fun. I have a better idea. Set up a separate
e-mail account to use in these out-in-the-open kinds of scenarios. (ISPs such
as AOL let you set up myriad accounts or screen names.) You’ll still get spam
there. Just don’t bother using those accounts to send or receive e-mail.
Instead, treat your other account or accounts as the sacred ones you share
with family, friends, and colleagues.
Setting the rules
Potent as Apple is at filtering spam, you can set up your own filters, or rules,
for combating junk. But you can set rules also to automatically reorganize the
messages on hand that are perfectly acceptable. When incoming mail meets
certain conditions such as who sent the mail or the subject matter, the Mail
program automatically forwards, highlights, or files them accordingly. For
instance, you might want to redirect all the messages you’ve received from
your investment advisor into a mailbox named stock tips.
To set up a rule, follow these steps:
1. Choose Mail➪Preferences, and then click the Rules tab.
2. Select Add Rules to open the pane shown in Figure 10-9.
166
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

3. Choose parameters identifying which messages are affected by the
rule.
To redirect e-mail from your financial guru, for example, choose From in
the first box, Begins With in the second box and the name in the third.
4. Now choose parameters for what happens to those messages.
In this instance, those messages will be highlighted in green and moved
to the stocktips mailbox.
5. When you’ve finished entering parameters, click OK.
Smart mailboxes
In Chapter 6, you discover dynamic smart folders. Welcome to the e-mail vari-
ation, smart mailboxes. Just as smart folders are constantly on the prowl for
new items that match specific search criteria, smart mailboxes do the same.
They are tightly integrated with Tiger’s Spotlight search technology.
You can set up smart mailboxes as a way to organize all mail pertaining to a
specific project or all mail from a specific person. For instance, you might
want to create a smart mailbox containing all correspondence with your boss
for the most current fortnight. Mail older than two weeks is replaced by the
latest exchanges.
Incidentally, the messages you see in a smart mailbox are virtual; they still
reside in their original locations. In that sense, they are similar to aliases,
described in Chapter 7.
Figure 10-9:
You have to
establish
rules.
167
Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

To create a smart box:
1. Choose Mailbox➪New Smart Mailbox.
The screen shown in Figure 10-10 appears.
2. Use the pop-up menus and text fields to characterize the parameters of
the mailbox.
The process is similar to the one you follow when creating a rule. To add
criteria, click the + button. To remove a condition, click the - button.
3. When you’re finished, click OK.
Searching mail
With an assist from Spotlight, the Mac’s fast and comprehensive search system,
you can find a specific e-mail messages, or the content of those messages, in a
jiffy.
 To search an open message, choose Edit➪Find and type the text you’re
looking for.
 You can also enter a search term in the search box at the upper-right
portion of the Mail program screen. Use the All Mailboxes, Entire
Messages, From, To, or Subject headers (which appear only when you’ve
entered a search) to determine how to display the results.
Opening attachments
You already discovered how to send attachments. But now the tide has
shifted, and someone sends you one (or more). Attachments appear with an
icon in the body of the message, as shown in Figure 10-11.
Figure 10-10:
The
smartest
mailbox
around.
168
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

You have a few choices:
 Drag the icon onto the desktop or a Finder window.
 Double-click the icon, and the attachment should open in the program
designed to handle it (for example, Word for a Word file or Preview for
an image).
 Click Save to save the file to a particular destination on your computer.
Normally, I tell people not to open attachments they weren’t expecting, even
if they know the sender. Mac users can be a little more relaxed about this
than their Windows cousins. While the times they are a-changin’, the odds
that the attachment will damage the Mac, even if it did carry some type of
Windows virus, are low.
If you want to remove an attachment from an incoming message, choose
Message➪Remove Attachments. As a reminder, the body of the message will
include a line telling you that the attachment in question has been “manually
removed.”
Making the Most of Your Mail
Before leaving this chapter, I want to introduce other ways to get the most
out of your e-mail:
Figure 10-11:
Attachments
show up
with an icon
in the
message
body.
169
Chapter 10: Going Postal over E-Mail

 View a photo slideshow: Picture attachments are afforded special treat-
ment. Click the Slideshow button that appears when someone sends you
pictures and you can view the attached images in a lovely full-screen
slideshow. From an on-screen control panel, you can go back to the pre-
vious image, pause the slideshow, or advance to the next slide. You can
also click to add pictures to your iPhoto library (see Chapter 15). When
you’re finished with the slide show, press the Escape key on the key-
board to go back to the original e-mail.
 Pass it on: Sometimes you get stuff that is so rip-roaringly hysterical (or
at the other extreme, tragic and poignant) you want to share it with
everyone you know. To forward a message, click the Forward button
inside the e-mail and enter the recipient’s address in the New Message
window that pops up. The entire previous e-mail will go out intact, save
for a couple of subtle additions: the Fwd: prefix in the Subject line, and
the phrase “Begin forwarded message” above the body of the message.
You can add an introductory comment along the lines of “This made me
laugh out loud” or “I’m sorry to have to call this to your attention.”
 Synchronize e-mail: If you have a .Mac account (Chapter 12), you can
synchronize all your rules, signatures, and other settings across all your
Tiger computers.
 Use parental controls: You can restrict who junior can correspond with
through e-mail to only those addresses you’ve explicitly okayed. Visit
System Preferences under the Ú menu and choose Accounts. You’ll be
notified when your kid gets (or tries to send) messages to addresses not
on your authorized list.
 Get rid of mail: You can dispose of mail in a number of ways. Highlight a
message and press Delete on the keyboard. Drag the message to the
Trash folder. Or click the Delete button on the toolbar. The messages
aren’t permanently banished until you choose Mailbox➪Erase Deleted
Messages. Apple can automatically extinguish mail for good after one
day, one week, or one month, or when you quit the Mail program. To set
this up, go to Mail Preferences, click Accounts, choose an account, and
select Mailbox Behaviors.

F
olks routinely surf the Web seeking specific types of information.
Headlines, stock quotes, vacation deals, weather, homework help, sports
scores, and technical support. But as much as anything, the Internet is about
meeting and connecting with people. These people could be job prospects or
would-be employers. Or people who share your zeal for the Chicago Cubs,
sushi, and Macintosh computers. Persuasion takes on a major role in cyber-
space too. You’ll get on your virtual high horse and attempt to coax others
around to your way of thinking.
And, yes, finding companionship, romance, and (under the best of circum-
stances), long-lasting relationships is part of the cyber-experience too.
Critics have often sneered, “these people need to get a life.” But many
Netizens (citizens of the Internet) have rewarding lives online and offline,
thank you very much. And on the Net, they’re congregating in vibrant commu-
nities with individuals of similar interests and passions.
We’ll explore many of these avenues in this chapter.

Chat Rooms
A lot of congregating on the Net happens in chat rooms, areas where you can
converse in real time on pretty much any topic: knitting and quilting, cricket,
fad diets, parenting, biotechnology, model airplanes, extraterrestrial sightings,
and on and on. The conversing has typically been left up to your fingertips.
Indeed, typos be damned; expect to bang away at the keyboard with reckless
abandon because text exchanges in chat rooms come fast and furious. There
may be a few dozen people or more in a room. Good luck determining who’s
talking to whom.
As broadband hookups becoming increasingly common, audio and video
chats (through the use of a small cameras called webcams) are likewise
becoming more widespread.
Chat is also a staple in the online gaming environment. In an immersive three-
dimensional virtual fantasy world, your persona may be represented by an
animated avatar. One such setting (available to Mac users with a recent ver-
sion of OS X) is called Second Life (www.secondlife.com). Be aware that
the environment sometimes exceeds PG-13 sensibilities.
Some chat rooms are monitored by people who make sure that the discourse
is civil and courteous. In rare instances, monitors may dictate who can and
cannot speak, or they may boot somebody out.
The first exposure many people had to chat rooms was inside the virtual con-
fines of America Online. AOL established a set of community guidelines, mostly
having to do with banning hateful speech as well as threatening or abusive
behavior. As you can see in Figure 11-1, the subject categories in chat rooms are
quite varied. AOL’s primary rivals, Yahoo! and MSN, run their own chat areas.
I tell people visiting a chat group for the first time to say hi to everyone and
then take a backseat. Observe. Get a feel for the place. Figure out whether
participants are around the same age (or maturity level) as you. Determine
whether they’re addressing topics you care about — and speak the same lan-
guage. Participants in these joints come from all over the planet (and some-
times it seems from outer space).
Along those lines, don’t be surprised if it appears as though members of the
chat community are typing in tongues. You’ll notice strange uses of punctua-
tion and abbreviations. Check out the “And you thought mastering Latin was
difficult?” sidebar for a crash course in emoticon linguistics.

Common Emoticons
:) = smile
;) = wink
:D = laughing
:( = frown
:’( = crying
>:-} = a devil
0:-) = an angel
{ } = hug
:* = kiss
:P = sticking out tongue
Common Acronyms
BTW = By The Way
ROTF = Rolling On The Floor (Laughing)
LOL = Laugh Out Loud
IMHO = In My Humble Opinion
BRB = Be Right Back
TTFN = Ta-Ta For Now
GMTA = Great Minds Think Alike
F2F = Face to Face
FOAF = Friend Of a Friend
WB = Welcome Back
Becoming fluent in the lingo of chat rooms and instant messaging is crucial if you want to fit in or
merely understand what’s taking place. However, remember to resist the overuse of emoticons in
your e-mails and real-world correspondence.

Communicating One-on-One: 
Instant Messaging
You may be speaking (broadcasting really) to dozens of people at a time in a
chat room. But what if you strike a bond with the mysterious stranger whose
quips catch your fancy? And want to whisper sweet nothings behind this
person’s ear and no one else’s? Such intimacy requires a private conversa-
tion. It requires an instant message, or IM.
Instant messages need not originate in chat rooms, and for most people they
do not. Participants instead rely on dedicated instant messaging client soft-
ware that can be downloaded for free from AOL, Yahoo!, Microsoft, and
Skype.
Just as the company did with e-mail, AOL gets the lion’s share of the credit
for spreading IMing — yes, you can treat it as verb — among the masses in
the United States. AOL owns the popular AOL Instant Messenger, or AIM, soft-
ware, as well as the exceedingly popular global IM program, ICQ. You can
fetch these free without joining AOL at www.aim.com and www.icq.com,
respectively. In fact, as we’ll see shortly, you need not even download AIM,
because Apple’s own iChat program lets you kibitz with the AIM community.
Instant messaging has become a mainstay in business as well as in social cir-
cles. It’s a complement to e-mail and in many ways more appealing. Here’s
why: Just as in a chat room, instant messaging conversations occur in real
time, without the delays associated with e-mail. In addition, IM permits the
kind of spontaneity that’s not possible through e-mail or even an old-fash-
ioned phone call. Through a concept known as presence, you can tell not only
whether the people you want to IM are currently online but also whether
they’re willing to chat. Status indicators next to their names on a buddy list
clue you in on their availability.
Instant messaging has at least one major downside compared to e-mail and
the plain old telephone: the lack of interoperability among the major IM pur-
veyors. For competitive reasons, market leader AOL carefully guards its
buddy list, so an AIM member can’t send a direct instant message to a Yahoo!
or MSN user, at least not without techie workarounds. Think about what
would happen if a Verizon cell phone customer, say, couldn’t call a friend who
was a Cingular subscriber, and vice versa.
Just as regular chat has evolved well beyond a text-only communications
channel, so has instant messaging. Today’s IM programs let you engage in
audio exchanges and make free computer-to-computer Internet phone calls.
174
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Moreover, if you have a webcam — and owners of certain new Macs are
blessed with built-in iSight cameras — you can also hold face-to-face conver-
sations. And that leads us to Apple’s own ever-evolving instant messaging
application, iChat AV.
iChat AV
In truth, calling iChat AV an instant messaging program is selling it way short,
kind of like telling somebody that Michael Jordan knows how to make free
throws. The AV part stands for audio visual or audio video, depending on who
you ask.
So yes, iChat is a competent instant messenger for handling traditional text
chatter. But consider some of iChat’s other tricks:
 You can exchange files while talking with someone.
 You can have a free audio conference with up to nine other people.
 You can engage in a video conference from your Mac desktop with up to
three other people.
You’ll need at least one of the following to get going with iChat:
 An existing AIM or AOL screen name and password. As noted, iChat is
tied in with AOL’s popular instant messaging program.
 A Jabber ID. You can use a Jabber ID to exchange messages with
cohorts who share the same Jabber servers. Jabber is an open standard
chat system employed in many organizations. Through Jabber, you can
exchange instant messages with a Google Talk member. Although iChat
is still not directly compatible with screen names from the MSN or
Yahoo! instant messaging systems, you may be able to do a technologi-
cal workaround through Jabber.
 By using or signing up for a fee-based .Mac account. You can get a free
.Mac account just for the purposes of using iChat by sampling all the
other .Mac features on a trial basis. (You have to pay to keep using these
other features, which I elaborate on in Chapter 12; you can hold onto
your iChat account for as long as you want.)
 On a local network or in a classroom using Apple technology called
Bonjour, formerly known as Rendezvous. Through this built-in technol-
ogy, iChat lets you see who on your local network is available to chat.
Bonjour, however, is used for configuration-free networking throughout
OS X.
175
Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web

If you want to exploit video, you’ll need a fast broadband Internet connection,
plus a compatible camera. Apple’s own iSight camera (standard on recent
iMac and MacBook Pro models) works well, but any FireWire-based camera
should do. You’ll also need a Mac with OS X version 10.2.5 or later.
Hey buddy
Naturally, iChat AV is useless without one more essential component: At least
one other person with whom to schmooze. If you signed up with an AIM
account and have been using AOL’s instant messenger for awhile, your buddy
list may already be populated with a bunch of names.
To add new people to the list, click the + button at the bottom of the Buddy
List window, choose Buddies➪Add Buddy, or press Shift+Ô+A. You’re given
the option to choose an entry from your Address Book. (Data you put there is
made available to iChat.) Otherwise, click New Person to add, well, a new
person. You type the person’s chat name (under Account Name) and fill in
the other blanks shown in Figure 11-2. The person’s name turns up instantly
on your buddy list. A buddy list is as long as you are popular.
You can also lump your buddies into groups (such as co-workers and soccer
team). To do so, Choose View➪Use Groups and click + to add or edit a group.
The buddy list has a bunch of visual status cues. Your buddy may have
included a mug shot, perhaps through the Mac’s Photo Booth feature (see
Chapter 5). Or your buddies may express themselves through small images
called buddy icons. What’s more, a telephone symbol tells you whether you
can connect through voice, and a movie camera icon indicates that you can
connect through video, as shown in Figure 11-3.
Figure 11-2:
Adding new
buddies to
the list.
176
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Mostly you’ll be able to tell whether your buddies are online at the moment
and willing to give you the time of day. Here’s how:
 A green circle to the left of a person’s name means he or she is ready
and (presumably) willing to talk.
 A red circle means the person is online but otherwise engaged. The
person is considered Away.
 A yellow circle means the person on your list is idle and has not used
the machine for awhile (the window tells you how long the person has
been in this state). Your buddy just hasn’t bothered to change his or her
status from Available to Away.
 If a name is dimmed, your buddy isn’t logged on to iChat or AIM.
You can set your own status for everyone else to see. And you are not limited
to Available or Away. Click under your own name and choose Custom from
the drop-down list. You can choose a custom message to appear next to a
green or red circle, depending on your circumstance. Type any message you
want, such as, can chat in a pinch but busy or back after lunch.
Figure 11-3:
Visual cues

177
Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web

Incidentally, if you’ve been absent from the computer for awhile, the Mac will
kindly welcome you back to the machine and ask whether you want to
change your iChat online status from Away back to Available.
Chatting
To initiate an instant message, double-click a name in the buddy list, which
pops up whenever you open iChat. Type something in the bottom box. Hey
stranger will suffice for now.
Alternately, you can chose File➪New Chat and enter the name of the person
with whom you would like to chat. This can be done even if the individual is
not in your buddy list or Address Book.
What you type instantly appears in a comic-strip bubble in the upper portion
of the window. If the person responds, what he or she has to say appears in
its own comic-strip bubble. And so on.
To illustrate this point, check out Figure 11-4. It shows yours truly having a
silly conversation with yours truly. (Honestly, I don’t normally talk to myself.
This little exercise is strictly for the benefit of the reader.)
Now say you’re having an important IM exchange with your lawyer or
accountant. Or swapping tuna casserole recipes with your best friend. You
may want a record of your conversation that you can easily refer to later. To
create a transcript of your chitchatting, open iChat Preferences, shown in
Figure 11-5. To do so, click the iChat menu and then click Preferences. Choose
the Messages icon and then select the Automatically Save Chat Transcripts
option.
Figure 11-4:

Right Ed?
178
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

You can use iChat also to send files to your IM buddy (or get a file in return).
Not only is it convenient, but unlike with e-mail there’s no size restriction on
the file you’re sharing. (You can send only one file at a time, however.) Select
a name on your buddy list and then choose Buddies➪Send File. Select the file
you want to send. Alternatively, drag a file to a buddy’s name or into the area
of an open chat window. Either way, your buddy has the option to accept or
reject the incoming file.
While we’re on the painful subject of rejection, if one of your buddies (or
anyone else) initiates an IM and you don’t feel like talking, click Decline in the
window that pops up.

Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web
Sharing a tune
You can tell your IM chums what music you are
listening to in iTunes. From the iChat drop-down
list indicating your availability status, choose
Current iTunes Track. This serves a few pur-
poses, best I can tell. For one thing, your pals
will discover how hip you are (assuming they
don’t know it already). What’s more, you
become an influencer: If your friends click your
musical selection, they can preview the song in
the iTunes Music Store (Chapter 14). If your bud-
dies purchase ten or more of the songs you’re
listening to over a two-week period, Apple
sends you a computer. Okay, so I made the last
part up. But know this: Steve Jobs will really like
you.

If the person gets on your nerves, click Block to prevent the person from ever
sending you IMs again. (Just know that your would-be buddies can do the
same to you.)
You can proactively determine who can see that you’re online and send you
messages. Under iChat Preferences, click the Accounts icon and then click
the Security tab. Choose a Privacy Level that you’re comfortable with. The
options are
 Allow anyone.
 Allow people in my buddy list.
 Allow specific people. If you make this choice, you have to type each
person’s AIM or .Mac address.
 Block everyone.
 Block specific people. Again, type the appropriate addresses.
Seeing is believing; hearing too
As I already alluded to, IMing and text chatting in general are kind of yester-
day’s news (though still darn useful). The twenty-first-century way of commu-
nicating is through a video phone call. (Never mind that a primitive version
of this technology was exhibited at the 1964 New York World’s Fair.)
Assuming your camera and microphone are configured to your liking, click
the video camera icon in the buddy list or, for just an audio session, click the
telephone icon. Members of your buddy list have little icons next to their
names too; these icons are telephones or video icons depending on their
respective configurations.
As usual your IM partner has the option to accept or decline the invitation. If
he or she accepts, you can gaze at each other full screen.
This stuff is super slick. In a multiroom conference, participants appear in a
virtual three-dimensional conference room with authentic video effects that
make people’s reflections bounce off a conference table, as you can see in
Figure 11-6.
The quality is generally pretty good, though the picture may show some dis-
tortion, depending on your cable or DSL connection.
The video used in iChat (and QuickTime) adheres to a video standard known
as H.264 or Advanced Video Codec (AVC). It’s meant to deliver crisp video in
smaller file sizes, saving you bandwidth and storage.

If you have a webcam but your IM buddies do not, they still get the benefit of
seeing your smiling face at least. And provided they have a mike, you still get
to hear them.
Having an Online Voice
There are lots of places on the Internet for you to be heard and seen. In this
section we explore some of these places.
Newsgroups
The term newsgroups may make you think of journalists retreating to the
nearest watering hole after deadline. (Been there, done that.) Or a posse of
friends sitting around together watching, I dunno, Katie Couric. Newsgroups
are defined differently in the chapter you are so kindly reading.
Newsgroups go by numerous descriptors: electronic (or online) bulletin
boards, discussion groups, forums, and Usenet (a techie name that dates
back to Duke University in the late 1970s). Google acquired the Usenet
archives in 2001; through Google Groups, you can read more than one billion
Usenet postings dating back to 1981.

Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web

In a nutshell, people post and respond to messages on everything and any-
thing: pipe smoking, low-carb diets, monster movies, world-class tenors, 
nanotechnology, canine incontinence, alternative sources of energy, snake
charmers . . . Thousands of these discussions are taking place online.
Newsgroups generally adhere to a hierarchical structure. At the top level,
you’ll see comp for computers, rec for recreation, sci for sciences, soc for
socializing, talk for politics, news for Usenet, misc for miscellaneous. alt for
alternative and so on. As you move down the food chain, the categories
become more specific. So you might start at alt, then drill down to
alt.animals, then alt.animals.cats, then alt.animals.cats.siamese.
You’ll need a newsgroup reader program to read these posts. If you bought
Microsoft Office for the Mac, it includes a newsreader in the Entourage e-mail
program.
You can also download free or low-cost shareware newsreaders for the Mac.
They go by names such as Hogwash, MacSoup, MT-NewsWatcher,
NewsHunter, Thoth, and Unison.
Blogs
Blogs, or weblogs, have become an Internet phenomenon. The blogging
search engine Technorati is tracking more than 47 million blog sites and
counting. Some 70,000 new blogs pop up every day, and there are about
700,000 posts daily.
Although still in its relative infancy, the blogosphere has already been
exploited by politicians, educational institutions, marketers, publicists, and
traditional media outlets. And as you might imagine, you can also find Mac-
related blogs, such as blog.wired.com/cultofmac, www.tuaw.com (The
Unofficial Apple Weblog), and www.theappleblog.com.
Some bloggers may dream of becoming journalistic superstars overnight,
though few achieve such status. And many in the mainstream media fret that
bloggers lack editorial scrutiny and journalistic standards. But most blogs are
nothing more than personal journals meant to be read by a tight circle of
friends and family. Bloggers share their musings, provide links to other con-
tent, and invite comments from others.
Destinations for creating and hosting a blog include Google’s free Blogger.com
service, WordPress, also free, and SixApart’s TypePad (starting at $5 a month).
You can subscribe to or read other blogs through technology known as RSS.
See the “What the heck is RSS?” sidebar? for more information. You can use
the Mac’s new iWeb program to publish a blog through the .Mac service ($100
a year).

Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web
What the heck is RSS?
Blogs and other news feeds are distributed
through a technology known as RSS, shorthand
for Really Simple Syndication. You can view RSS
feeds in a Safari browser (they’re sometimes
called XML feeds). When you subscribe to an
RSS feed, you’ll get a barebones summary (and
title) for articles listed, such as the feed shown
here from my USA TODAY tech column. You can
click the Read more link to check out the full
article. If Safari finds a feed, RSS appears in the
address bar, as shown in the figure.
If you want to be notified when new feeds arrive,
go to Safari preferences (found in the Safari
menu), click RSS, and select how often to check
for RSS updates (every 30 minutes, every hour,
every day, or never). To peek at all RSS feeds
(from multiple sites) at one time — a great way to
customize your own newspaper, in effect —
place all your feeds in a single bookmark folder.
Then click the folder’s name and choose View All
RSS Articles.
You can even turn your RSS feeds into a cool
screensaver with flying news headlines that
charge at you like the credits in a Tinseltown
blockbuster. Choose System Preferences under
the Ú menu, click Desktop & Screen Saver, and
then click the Screen Saver tab. Next, in the
Screen Savers list, click RSS Visualizer. Then
click the Options button and select a specific
RSS feed. If you want to read the underlying
news story, you’ll be instructed to press the 1
key to read one feed, 2 key to read another, and
so on. 

Social Networking
Who do you know? Who do your friends know? Who do the friends of your
friends know? Oh, and how can I benefit from six (or many fewer) degrees of
separation?
That’s pretty much what online social networks are all about. By leveraging
your direct and indirect contacts, you might find a place to live, broker the
deal of the century, or land a recording contract. That’s the hope anyway.
Hate to be a glass-is-half-empty kind of guy, but none of these outcomes is
guaranteed.
Still, social networking sites can help you network and help you be social.
They may combine blogs, instant messaging, photo sharing, and other tools.
Some are difficult to pigeonhole, so don’t take offense if the dozen sites listed
next don’t fit the classic definition of social networking, assuming there is
such a thing:
 www.classmates.com: Looking for an old high-school flame? An Army
buddy? Classmates is a good place to wax nostalgic and find reunions.
 www.craigslist.com: A network of global community sites in dozens
of international cities with forums and free classifieds advertising jobs,
gigs, housing, personals, and more.
 www.facebook.com: Social networking on the college campus and in
select corporations.
 www.flickr.com: Image sharing site (owned by Yahoo!). Members tag
their uploaded pictures so they can be discovered by others.
 www.friendster.com: An early pioneer in online social networking,
with more than 27 million member profiles.
 www.imeem.com: Instant messaging meets social networking.
 www.jokebox.com: Billed as MySpace.com meets Comedy Central.
 www.linkedin.com: Geared toward helping you with business and pro-
fessional connections.
 www.MySpace.com: A popular hang-out (more than 70 million mem-
bers) for young people, including burgeoning musicians. Now owned by
Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.
 www.orkut.com: An invitation-only community owned by Google that
seems to attract an intelligent crowd.
184
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

 360.yahoo.com: A place to share blogs, pictures, recommended books,
music, movies, and more.
 www.youtube.com: A place to upload and share amateur videos, includ-
ing bootleg footage from concerts.
The Virtual Meet Market
As you might have surmised by now, Cupid spends a lot of time on the
Internet. You may even run into him in one of the aforementioned social net-
working sites. But if you’re determined to find a mate in cyberspace at all
costs, the direct approach is probably best. Dating sites often let you peruse
online personals and fill out detailed online profiles for free. With some varia-
tion in subscriptions and fees, they typically start charging only when you’re
ready to get in touch with Mr. or Ms. Right.
Rest assured, there’s a dating site to fit your lifestyle. Online matchmakers
focus on particular communities, political beliefs, sexual preferences, religions,
hobbies, and even love of four-legged creatures (check out datemypet.com).
The following sites are among the major mass-market online matchmaking
destinations:
 www.americansingles.com: Lets you send “flirts,” or one-liners, to
members you’re interested in. The object of your affection can flirt back
if he or she so desires.
 www.eharmony.com: For the marriage-minded. eHarmony eschews the
term dating site and is instead an online matchmaker that attempts to
find people it thinks are right for you. Founder Dr. Neil Clark Warren says
he has identified the 29 “dimensions” of compatibility that make for a
successful, long-term relationship. (I don’t think it’s among the blessed
29, but it helps if you and your potential mate both have Macs.)
 www.match.com: Features relationship insights from Dr. Phil.
 personals.yahoo.com: Offers two pay services — basic membership
for casual daters and premium membership for those seeking serious,
long-term relationships.
 www.true.com: Says it will prosecute married men and criminals who
try to use the service.
185
Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web

A few important disclaimers: I take no responsibility for who you meet online
through these or other Web sites (unless it works and then you can invite me
to the wedding). And I can’t predict what kind of sparks will fly if a Windows
user pairs up with Mac loyalist.
Buying Stuff Online
Grandpa, what was it like when people shopped in stores?
I doubt you’ll hear such a conversation anytime soon. But more and more
people are purchasing products online, and those products are not just books,
music, and software. Increasingly, folks go to the Net to shop for big-ticket
items: backyard swing sets for the kiddies, high-definition televisions, and
even automobiles. Electronic commerce, or e-commerce, is alive and kicking.
Shopping over the Internet has many plusses. For example:
 You avoid crowds and traffic.
 You save on gas or commuting costs.
 You avoid pushy salespeople.
 You can easily compare products and prices across numerous Web sites,
increasing the likelihood that you’ll end up with an excellent deal. Visit
such comparison shopping sites as www.mysimon.com, www.price-
grabber.com, and www.shopzilla.com.
 You can choose from a large inventory of products (which is not to sug-
gest that stuff won’t be out of stock).
 You can get buying recommendations from your cyber-peers.
Shopping online has a few negatives too:
 You can’t “kick the tires” or otherwise inspect the items under 
consideration.
 You won’t get personal attention from a reliable salesperson.
 You might get spammed.
 Without proper safeguards, your privacy could be at risk.
186
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

 Instant gratification becomes an oxymoron, except on such items as
downloadable software and music.
 You can’t make goo-goo eyes with attractive strangers you might meet
cruising the aisles.
Amazon.com
As an e-commerce pioneer, Amazon.com is probably still best known for sell-
ing millions of discounted books online. But you can shop for items across
more than 30 product categories, from video games and computers (includ-
ing Macs) to gourmet foods and pet supplies.
Before spending any loot on a book or other merchandise, you can read online
reviews from fellow customers. You might also want to consult the “Customers
who bought this item, also bought this” list. Amazon has been at the forefront
of many online shopping initiatives, including 1-Click Shopping (rapid way to
process an order as long as your credit card and shipping info are on file) and
Wish List (letting folks know what you want for your birthday).
Indulging the eBay addiction
I don’t know who first uttered the cliché “one person’s junk is another
person’s treasure,” but he or she could have been describing eBay. The famed
Internet auction site has listings for more than 10 million items in thousands
of product categories, and more than 100 million registered users. Many
buyers are insanely obsessed — and believe me I say that with affection.
eBay is the ultimate garage sale. It’s only a slight exaggeration to suggest that
if you can’t find the thing you’re looking for on eBay, you probably can’t find it
anywhere. Many of the products peddled on eBay have long since gone out of
circulation. It’s a hodgepodge that includes obscure products, interesting
inventions, memorabilia, and collectibles. Maybe you’re looking for vintage
comic books, an original Cabbage Patch Kid doll, replacements for broken
china dishes, or even a 1970s, 8-track cartridge player (heaven knows why?).
Sellers on eBay peddle new stuff too, from digital camcorders to acoustic gui-
tars. (Some folks make a decent living selling wares through the service.)
Indeed, eBay may be a godsend if you finally get around to cleaning the attic.
Keep it quiet, but you can also get rid of that homely “what-were-they-think-
ing” serving plate you received as a wedding gift.
187
Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web

Managing travel
It used to be that people bought airline tickets and booked hotels over the
Internet strictly for convenience. After all, booking online beats languishing
on hold waiting to talk to an airline customer service rep. And you can
choose seats from the comfort of your own keyboard and even print boarding
passes. (Okay, when things get complicated with connections or flying with
pets, you might still want to go through an airline staffer or a travel agent.).
Nowadays, carriers want you to go through the Web and take advantage of e-
tickets. In fact, you’re typically penalized for requesting a paper ticket.
Although you can find deals elsewhere, the big three online travel sites —
www.expedia.com, www.orbitz.com, and www.travelocity.com — are
worth a visit. Also check out the carrier’s own Web site and ask to get on an
e-mail list in which the airline notifies you of last-minute bargains.
Putting Sherlock on the Trail
Sherlock, Apple’s Internet sleuth, is meant to help you get to the bottom of
specific kinds of Web searches on the quick, from tracking stocks and eBay
auctions, to finding out whether your flight is on time and when flicks you
want to see are playing. Searches are assigned to specific Sherlock channels,
known as Dictionary, Translation, and so on (see Figure 11-7).
Figure 11-7:
Sherlock is
on the case.
188
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Sherlock gets on the case when you single-click the dock icon with the detec-
tive hat and magnifying glass (if it’s there) or call upon its services from the
Applications folder. Following are a few of the channels worth noting:
 Translation: Type the phrase you want to translate in the original text box,
and then select the original language and the language you want to trans-
late the words into from the drop-down menu that appears. See Figure 11-8.
Figure 11-8:

Chapter 11: Caught Up in the Web
A researcher’s toolbox
Imagine if you could take the Britannica or
World Book Encyclopedia and alter or update it
at will. You now have some idea of what
Wikipedia, found at www.wikipedia.org,
is all about. It’s billed as a free encyclopedia that
anyone can edit. At the very least, entries are
more timely. The collaborative global perspec-
tive may provide insights lacking in other refer-
ence material.
I know what you’re thinking. There’s a flip side
to all this. What if I’m mischievous? What if I’m
biased? What if I’m a misinformed know-it-all?
Why couldn’t I change the text to read that the
South won the Civil War, or Dewey beat
Truman? Yes, it can and does happen, because
the very essence of a wiki allows for anyone
with an Internet connection to mess with any of
the references. In most instances, blatant van-
dalism and dubious submissions are corrected
by the collective efforts of honest writers and
editors from around the world.
But open-sourced wiki entries are organic and
never quite finished, and mistakes are intro-
duced, overtly or subtly, consciously or other-
wise. One side of an argument might be
presented more eloquently than another. There
is almost always room for interpretation and
debate. So, Wikipedia is a remarkably useful
online resource, provided you recognize its lim-
itations and don’t treat everything you come
across as gospel.

 AppleCare: This is a fast way to read troubleshooting tips and other
articles in the AppleCare knowledge base.
 Internet: Lets you quickly search the Web, but it’s no Google.
 Stocks: Enter the company name or the ticker symbol of stocks you’re
interested in, and Sherlock reports back the price of the last trade
(delayed 15 minutes), the change over the previous quote, and the day’s
range, volume, and relevant headlines. You can even display a mini stock
chart showing prices for the year, week, or intraday.
Whenever Apple adds channels, they automatically show up in Sherlock. But
has Scotland Yard (or Steve Jobs) put the famed detective on notice?
Sherlock already appears to be past his prime. Many of his duties are now
handled by newer and slicker Dashboard widgets (see Chapters 6 and 21).

Joining .Mac, the Club That Will
Have You for a Member
In This Chapter
 Deciding whether to join
 Getting to know iDisk
 Backing up digital keepsakes
 Turning to .Mac Mail
 Synchronizing multiple Macs
 Publishing your Web site
O
ne hundred bucks a year. That’s the price to join Apple’s .Mac (pro-
nounced “dot Mac”) service. The suite of Internet goodies you get for
that sum includes an e-mail account, tools to keep multiple Macs in sync, plus
online storage. Most .Mac services are cleverly woven into Tiger and iLife.
Okay, so my inner fact-checker compels me to point out that .Mac actually
costs $99.95 per annum. What’s a nickel among friends? While we’re at it, a
Family Pack .Mac subscription, (including a single master account and five
subaccounts) fetches $180, um, $179.95 per year.
If you really must know, .Mac used to be called iTools and used to be free.
Television was once free too, but no one argues when you get a lot more
viewing choices for the money. So it goes with .Mac. The folks at Apple have
piled on the features these last few years, even as they now make you fork
over extra coin.
Which raises the overall question: Is .Mac worth the price of admission? This
is where I’d love to pause, run a couple of commercials, keep you hanging for
a few minutes. They do it all the time on TV. Oh, well, wrong medium.
At the risk of copping out, the answer is, it depends.

192
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 
Why Belong?
In general, .Mac is a worthwhile investment for many but not all Mac owners.
The service gets a lot more interesting for you creative types looking to share
your inspirations — photos, blogs, Web pages, music — in cyberspace.
I suspect that most of you can take advantage of the extra online storage that
comes with .Mac membership.
Apple lets you use limited versions of certain .Mac features risk free for 60
days, so give it a shot. If it doesn’t work out, well, as they say in basketball,
no harm, no foul.
You’ll have the opportunity to sign up to a .Mac account (or trial) when you
first turn on your Mac. No worries if you’re already well past that point: Go to
System Preferences and click the .Mac icon (found under Internet & Network).
Or visit www.apple.com/dotmac.
Here’s a bird’s-eye view of .Mac features, some of which I’ll delve into in
greater detail in this chapter, some in other chapters:
 iLife Media Publishing: When you create Web sites or blogs through
iWeb or podcasts through GarageBand (see Chapter 17), .Mac gives you
a place to host, or publish, your work.
 Photocasting: Family and friends can “subscribe” to so-called photo-
casts consisting of dynamic photo albums you create in iPhoto 6
(Chapter 15). As you update those albums in iPhoto, they’re dynamically
updated on subscribers’ computers.
 iDisk: A centralized online storage facility you can use to exchange files
with others.
 Backup 3: A method of scheduling automatic backups for your Mac.
 Mail: An ad-free e-mail account with built-in virus protections.
 Groups: Lets you communicate, coordinate, and collaborate with other
friends, family, and colleagues who congregate in groups. Groups might
consist of classmates who arrange study sessions and field trips online.
You might create a group for the Little League team you’re managing, to
post photos and alert everyone to scheduling changes.
 Sync: Keeps contacts, calendars, bookmarks and other info in sync on
multiple Macs. .Mac Sync lets you access your Address Book from any
computer connected to the Net, including a Windows machine.

 Learning Center: Provides step-by-step tutorials and other training
resources for Tiger, iLife, and other applications.
 Member Central: A repository for free Mac software downloads and spe-
cial discounts.
With that, let’s examine some of .Mac’s most prominent features up close,
starting with the online storage lockers called iDisk.
iDisk Backups in the Sky
iDisk is arguably the most useful .Mac feature of all. Who wouldn’t want per-
sonal storage in the clouds, or in reality on Apple’s secure servers (that is,
big powerful computers)? For one thing, data copied to your iDisk is safe and
preserved if anyone ever drops a bowling ball on your computer (I don’t ask).
This won’t be the only reference in this book to the importance of backing up
your digital treasures.
What’s more, as long as you have an online connection, you can access the
files in your iDisk locker wherever you happen to be, even from a Windows
machine. Plus you can easily collaborate or exchange documents with others
or access files remotely yourself, especially those too large to e-mail.
Basic .Mac membership comes with 1GB (gigabyte) of storage space (as of
this writing), which you can allocate as you want between iDisk and your
.Mac e-mail account. You can boost the storage amount to 2GB or 4GB, for an
extra $49.95 or $99.95, respectively. Upgrade prices are prorated daily; your
.Mac expiration date is unchanged.
Subscribers to .Mac can access iDisk via the Finder by choosing Go➪iDisk➪
My iDisk (or by pressing Shift+Ô+I).
The icon for iDisk also shows up in all Finder windows.
You can connect to another user’s iDisk or Public folder in the same manner.
Click that icon now. If you didn’t know better, you’d think iDisk was like any
other hard drive inside or connected to your computer.
An iDisk actually consists of ten folders (or eleven for a Family Pack account)
for storing your digital valuables. Storing files inside these folders is as
simple as dragging stuff to them, just as with any Mac folder. Most of the fold-
ers shown in Figure 12-1, including Documents, Movies, Music, and Pictures,
are self-explanatory.
193
Chapter 12: Joining .Mac, the Club That Will Have You for a Member

I’ll highlight the others:
 Public: You can share the contents of this folder with anybody in cyber-
space who knows your .Mac name and (if you created one) password.
 Sites: Holds the Web pages you spawned through a .Mac feature called
HomePage.
 Groups: Here’s where to put files for the Little League team, book club,
or the clandestine committee planning to overthrow your company’s
management. .Mac Groups members can share calendars, photos, files,
and so on, and post to group message boards. They also get ad-free
e-mail. The iDisk Groups folder has subfolders accessible only to group
members.
 Shared: This folder appears only if you have a Family Pack .Mac mem-
bership. Included are files that can be accessed by the master account
holder and subaccounts.
 Backup: Houses the files you’ve backed up using a .Mac software feature
called Backup, which I cover later in the chapter.
 Software: Includes programs and files available only to .Mac members,
plus other software you can download from Apple. You can’t drag your
own files to this folder.
 Library: Another read-only folder. It includes files for .Mac Sync, which
lets you keep personal data (such as bookmarks, addresses, mailboxes,
and calendars) synchronized among all the Macs you own, provided
they’re connected to the Net.
Figure 12-1:
iDisk is
organized
into folders.
194
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

If you ever decide not to renew a .Mac account, drag your data back onto
your Mac’s own hard drive before the account expires.
Other Backup Methods
Backing up your digital keepsakes (pictures, videos, financial documents, and
so on) is vital. I hope I’ve impressed that upon you by now. (If I haven’t, what
will it take? A drum roll? Sworn affidavit?) If you take nothing else from this
book, know that you must back up your important data and do so regularly.
Lecture over.
iDisk is a terrific vehicle for backing up bits and bytes, but it doesn’t afford
you enough storage if you have, say, a sizable multimedia collection. So
today’s backup arsenal typically consists of recordable CDs and DVDs, exter-
nal hard drives, and networks.
As a .Mac subscriber, you can approach this backup business strategically,
whether you plan to copy stuff onto iDisk or some other destination. That’s
thanks to the Backup programs included with a .Mac membership. If you
have OS X version 10.3.9 or later, download a program called Backup 3. If you
have an earlier version of OS X, download Backup 2.
It’s up to you, of course, not only to determine which files and data to back
up but when exactly to schedule the backups.
Backup 3 can help. To open the program, click the umbrella icon in your
Applications folder. The first time you open the program, you’re greeted with
the window shown in Figure 12-2.
You’re presented with several ready-to-use backup plans, or templates:
Personal Data & Settings (to back up your Address Book contacts, for
instance), a plan to back up the music and videos you’ve purchased from the
iTunes Music Store (see the next chapter), a plan to backup iLife data, and a
plan to back up your Home folder. But you can also back up individual files
and folders as you see fit.
Apple recommends backing up onto iDisk daily any relatively small files that
change often. For larger files that don’t change as much, you might choose
weekly or monthly backups onto DVDs or external harder drives that can
accommodate sizable data storage requirements.
195
Chapter 12: Joining .Mac, the Club That Will Have You for a Member

If you already created settings in previous versions of Backup, you are given
the option to transfer those settings to Backup 3.
Say you click Personal Data & Settings. The window that appears, shown in
Figure 12-3, is divided into two panes. The top shows the backup items
you’ve chosen and the size requirements for those backups. The bottom
pane lists the destination and schedule for those backups.
After double-clicking one of these plans in the upper window, choose the Add
(+) or Remove (-) buttons to add or delete plans.
If you click the + button, you can choose items to back up in one of three ways:
 QuickPicks: These are shortcuts to backup plans involving certain types
of files: all your mail messages, your iPhoto library, or Microsoft Excel
documents, for example, as shown in Figure 12-4.
 Files & Folders: Lets you specify what you want to back up.
 Spotlight: Runs a quick search to figure out the files to copy.
Click Done to return to the main Backup window.

After you’ve determined all your backup items, click Back Up Now to begin
backing up right away or close the window to begin the backup according to
the schedule you’ve set.

Chapter 12: Joining .Mac, the Club That Will Have You for a Member

If possible, keep backup discs in a different location than your Mac; that way
you may be able to keep your data safe from a fire or other calamity.
The first time you copy a designated set of files, you’re doing a full backup.
Subsequent files are incremental; only the files altered since your last backup
are copied.
.Mac Mail
I’d like to tell you there’s something extra special about having a .Mac e-mail
account. But it’s like any other Web-based e-mail account. You can check
.Mac mail from any browser, and it integrates with the Mac’s Mail application.
The amount of storage you have is directly tied to the amount of storage you
use in iDisk. The basic .Mac membership lets you divvy up 1GB between iDisk
and .Mac Mail. .Mac storage isn’t as generous as other Web-based e-mail
accounts such as Google’s Gmail, which is free.
.Mac Sync
If you’re lucky enough to own two or more Macs, perhaps one for home and
another for the office, you can take advantage of .Mac Sync to keep all your
computers at least figuratively on the same page. With .Mac Sync, you can
synchronize Safari bookmarks, calendars, Address Book contacts, keychains
(passwords), and mail preferences. You need OS X version 10.4 or later to
exploit all these features.
.Mac Sync is different than iSync, Tiger’s own synchronization application
that helps you manage contact and calendar info on connected devices such
as a wireless Bluetooth cell phone, a Palm handheld, or an iPod. Use iSync to
synchronize files if you have a version of OS X earlier than 10.4.
To use .Mac Sync:
1. Open System Preferences and click .Mac.
2. Click the Sync tab.
3. Select the Synchronize with .Mac option, and make a selection from
the pop-up menu.
Your choices are Automatically, Every Hour, Every Day, Every Week, or
Manually.
4. Select the items you want to synchronize, as shown in Figure 12-5.
198
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

5. Enter the same synchronization settings on all the Macs you want syn-
chronized.
6. If you want, select the Show Status in Menu Bar option.
A little spinning circle will appear in the menu bar while the Macs are
synchronizing.
7. Click the Sync Now button.
8. Visit www.mac.com.
9. On the .Mac tab, click Address Book and then click Preferences.

Sharing Your Digital Masterpieces
The iWeb software introduced with iLife ’06 lets you build striking Web pages
and create online journals, or blogs, by laying your own content on top of
placeholder text and images found on predesigned Apple templates. After
you’re satisfied with your new creation, you can foist it on a waiting public by
publishing through your .Mac account.

Click the iWeb icon in the dock or open the program in the Applications
folder. Then, in iWeb, choose File➪Publish to .Mac to make your page visible
to others.
Incidentally, iWeb, which is part of the iLife suite, differs from HomePage,
which consists of sites included with .Mac membership stored on Apple’s
servers. You can’t edit HomePage sites in iWeb, though you can link between
HomePage and iWeb sites.
Consider adding a password to lock out strangers from viewing your site. Do
you really want to share your thoughts with everyone? In iWeb’s site orga-
nizer, select the site (or a specific page), click Inspector, and select the Make
My Published Site Private option. Then enter a user name and password that
visitors must enter to access your site.
Oh, and don’t use your .Mac password for this purpose.

his figured to be a short chapter. After all, OS X has been immune from
the swarm of viruses that have plagued Windows computers through the
years. Folks traditionally have needed to call a security specialist for their
Macs about as often as you summon the Maytag repair man.
But times change. Heck, Whirlpool bought Maytag. So when it comes to com-
puters nowadays, you can’t take anything for granted — even if you own a Mac.
The Truth about Internet Security
There are suggestions that OS X isn’t as bulletproof as was once believed. In
May 2006, the McAfee Avert Labs security threat research firm issued a
report claiming that the Mac is just as vulnerable to targeted malware, or
malicious software attacks, as other operating systems. According to McAfee,
between 2003 and 2005, the “annual rate of vulnerability” on Apple’s platform
increased by 228 percent, compared to 73 percent on the Microsoft side of
the ledger. Although the volume of threats is low, no invisible cloak is protect-
ing Apple’s products.

202
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 
Moreover, the security firm expects malicious hackers to increasingly place
the Mac OS (as well as the iPod) in the crosshairs, given Apple’s recent tran-
sition to Intel chips and especially as Apple’s products gain popularity.
The implication is that the bad guys haven’t spent much time targeting Apple
because the Mac has had such a miniscule market share. Although that argu-
ment may have some merit, Tiger and Macs in general have been engineered
with your protection in mind. Your operating system is as secure as they
come. Of course, now that a Mac can double as a Windows computer (see
Chapter 19), all bets are off.
What then are we to make of the McAfee report? Should Mac owners never
turn their computers on? Methinks not. But Mac loyalists shouldn’t get com-
placent either. For starters, you should install the security updates that show
up on your Mac when you click System Preferences under Software Updates.
And you should only load software on your computer from companies and
Web sites you trust.
Most of all, security requires a little common sense.
Spies in our mist
Viruses are menacing programs created for the sole purpose of wreaking
havoc on a computer or network. They spread when you download suspect
software, visit shady Web sites, or pass around infected discs.
Computer viruses take many forms. Windows users are all too familiar with
spyware, the type of code that surreptitiously shows up on your computer to
track your behavior and secretly report it to third parties.
Spyware typically differs from traditional computer viruses, which may try to
shut down your computer (or at least one or two programs on the machine).
Authors of spyware aren’t necessarily out to shut you down. Rather, they qui-
etly attempt to monitor your behavior so that they can benefit at your
expense.
At the lesser extremes, your computer is served pop-up ads that companies
hope will eventually lead to a purchase. This type of spyware is known as
adware.
At its most severe, spyware can place your personal information in the hands
of a not-so-nice person. Under those circumstances, you could get totally
ripped off. Indeed, the most malicious of spyware programs, called keyloggers
or snoopware, can capture every keystroke you enter, whether you’re holding
court in a public chat room or typing a password.

The good new is that as of this writing, no major reports of OS X–related spy-
ware have surfaced.
But there’s always a first time.
Gone phishing
Dear Citibank Member,
As part of our security measures, we regularly screen activity in the Citibank
system. We recently contacted you after noticing an issue on your account. We
requested information from you for the following reasons:
We have reason to believe that your account was accessed by a third party.
Because protecting the security of your account is our primary concern, we have
limited access to sensitive Citibank account features. We understand that this
may be an inconvenience but please understand that this temporary limitation
is for your protection.
This is a third and final reminder to log in to Citibank as soon as possible.
Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your account access.
We appreciate your understanding as we work to ensure account safety.
Sincerely,
Citibank Account Review Department
The text from the preceding e-mailed letter sounds legitimate enough. But the
only thing real about it is that this is an actual excerpt lifted from a common
Internet fraud known as a phishing attack.
Identity thieves, masquerading as Citibank, eBay, PayPal or other financial or
Internet companies, try to dupe you into clicking phony links to verify per-
sonal or account information. You’re asked to surrender home addresses,
passwords, social security numbers, credit cards numbers, banking account
information, and so on.
To lend authenticity to these appeals, the spoof e-mails often are dressed up
with real company logos and addresses, plus a forged company name in the
From line (for example, From: support@ebay.com).
Phishing may take the form of falsified company newsletters, as Figure 13-1
shows. Or there may be bogus requests for you to reconfirm personal data.
203
Chapter 13: Mounting a Defense Strategy

So how do you know when you’re being hoodwinked? Obvious giveaways
included in some fake e-mails are misspellings, rotten grammar, and repeated
words or sentences.
No company on the level is going to ask you to reconfirm data that has been
lost. And reputable companies usually refer to you by your real first and last
name and business affiliations rather than the more generic Dear Member or
Dear PayPal Customer.
If you have doubts that a communication is legit, you can always open a new
browser window and type the real company name yourself (for example,
www.ebay.com or www.paypal.com.) Your gut instincts concerning phony
mail are probably on the mark.
Bottom line: Never click links embedded in suspicious e-mails. When you hover
the cursor over a link such as www.paypal.com, it actually leads elsewhere.

Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Firewalls
More than likely, if you’re connecting to the Internet through a network router
(see Chapter 18), you’re protected by a shield known as a firewall. But Tiger
also has a software firewall, and you can use it to block unwanted Web traffic.
Here’s how to access it:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
2. In the Internet & Network section, click Sharing.
3. Click the Firewall tab.
This is where you turn on settings to stop incoming Internet traffic to
services and ports, except those you specify, as shown in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-2:
Selecting
the
communica-
tions your
firewall will
let in.
205
Chapter 13: Mounting a Defense Strategy

By clicking the New button, you can specify a port on which you’d like to
receive inbound networking traffic. Out of the box, Apple keeps all communi-
cation ports closed by default.
If you click the Advanced button, you’ll be able to log information about
unauthorized attempts and destinations blocked by the Mac’s firewall.
You can also operate the computer in Stealth mode (by selecting that option
in the Advanced section) so that any uninvited traffic receives no acknowl-
edgment or response from the Mac. Malicious hackers won’t even know
there’s a machine to attack.
Still another Advanced option is to block UDP (User Datagram Protocol) traf-
fic. UDP is another Internet communications method. While blocking UDP
may help secure your Mac, it may also restrict your Internet connections.
FileVault
If your computer houses truly hush-hush information — your company’s finan-
cial books, say, rather than Aunt Minnie’s secret noodle-pudding recipe — you
can scramble, or encrypt, the data in your Home folder (and only your Home
folder) using a Tiger feature known as FileVault. You know your secrets are 
protected should thieves get their grubby paws on your machine.
FileVault automatically applies the level of encryption employed by Uncle
Sam. It’s what nerds refer to as AES-128 (for Advanced Encryption Standard
with 128-bit keys). And let me tell you, it’s really secure. Apple claims it would
take a machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack the code. Even if
they’re off by a couple of billion years, I’m thinking your system is pretty safe.
The FileVault window shown in Figure 13-3 turns up when you choose
Security under System Preferences. As an administrator, you can set up a
safety net master password for your system, which you’ll need to unlock
FileVault. This computer-wide password can be used to bail out authorized
users on your system who forget their password. And it might be a lifesaver if
you run a small business through your Mac and have to let a wayward
employee go. You’ll be able to recover any data left behind in that person’s
account.
206
Part III: Rocketing into Cyberspace 

Heed Apple’s warning. If you forget your login password and master pass-
word, your scrambled data may as well be toast.
If FileVault is turned on and you’re not logged in to the machine, other people
you normally share folders with on the computer will not be able to access
those folders.
Password Management: The Key 
to Keychains
Have you stopped to think how many passwords are in your computing life?
You probably have so many that you use the same ones over and over,
though security experts think that’s not such a keen practice.
Figure 13-3:
Keeping
your
computer

207
Chapter 13: Mounting a Defense Strategy

The pun police will get on me for saying this, but Apple has the key to manag-
ing your passwords, account numbers, and other confidential info: a feature
known as keychain. A keychain can store passwords for programs, e-mail
accounts, Web sites, and more.
You can create different keychains for different purposes (one for online shop-
ping, say) by opening keychain access in the Utilities folder under Applications.
Your keychain password is initially the same as your login password, and for
many users that’s the way it’ll stay.
Logging In and Logging Out
If you work in an office or other environment where anyone can peek at the
monitor to see what you’ve been up to, log out of your account when you’re
finished doing what you’re doing.
But if you’d rather not bother logging out or you don’t think you’ll remember,
go to the Security pane of System Preferences, and select the Require
Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver option and the
Log Out after x Minutes of Inactivity option (refer to Figure 13-3).
You also may want to select the options to Disable Automatic Login and Use
Secure Virtual Memory. The latter setting ensures that data stored in virtual
memory is encrypted. You’ll have to restart the computer for the change to
take effect.
If you’re really distrustful, select the Require Password to Unlock Each Secure
System Preference option.
There. I told you this would be a short chapter.

T
he demographers may have missed it. But we’re in the midst of a major
population explosion. Everywhere you look, vast colonies of tiny white
earbuds are proliferating. They’re spotted on subways and on the street. On
airplanes, buses, and college and corporate campuses.
Those signature white earbuds, of course, are connected to iPods. And
there’s every chance you’re reading a Macintosh book because of them.
Although iPods are meant to work with iTunes software in Windows
machines as well as on OS X, your first infatuation with the Mac may well
have occurred in an Apple store where you ostensibly went to check out the
darling of all portable music players.
You also may be thinking that if Apple hit such a home run with the iPod, per-
haps Steve Jobs and crew know something about making darn impressive
computers too. (Naturally, you’d be right.)
For its part, the iPod has morphed into such a phenomenon that the acces-
sories business for the devices — cases, speaker systems, car radio adapters,
armbands, even a distance and pace sensor that fits into Nike shoes — sup-
posedly amount to a billion-dollar-plus business. That’s billion with a B.

So although this is first and foremost a computer book (and I promise we’ll
venture back to the Mac before long), please forgive a minor detour into iPod
territory. I won’t dwell on everything the iPod can do except to quickly men-
tion here that in addition to music and (with some models) video and pic-
tures, iPods can synchronize contacts and calendar information and store
text files.
I hope you’ll keep reading this chapter even if you don’t have an iPod. You
can still take advantage of iTunes.
Choosing Your iPod
Sprinkled throughout this book is the disclaimer as of this writing because
Apple is known for surprises. In late summer 2005, Apple replaced what had
been the best-selling iPod model to date, iPod Minis, because it came up with
something even more extraordinary, the Lilliputian Nano.
So all bets are off: Notwithstanding a special edition model tied to the rock
band U2, as of this writing, there are essentially three iPod classes, each sold
with different storage capacities.
By the time you read this, Apple may have finally unveiled a long rumored
iPod cell phone combination. (I’m not counting the phones that incorporate
iTunes software but otherwise bear no resemblance to genuine iPods.)
The “white” iPod
The so-called white iPod ($299 on up) represents the fifth generation of the
original iPod. Roughly the size of a deck of cards, the classic iPod, shown in
Figure 14-1, is white on the front with a scratch-prone mirrored finish on the
back. The devices are famous for their touch-sensitive scroll wheel, which
you use to control the gizmo’s operations (menus, skipping tracks,
play/pause, and more).
212
Part IV: Getting an iLife

At the time this book was published, the highest capacity iPod could hold up
to 15,000 songs, 25,000 photos, and 150 hours of video, from ancient reruns of
Alfred Hitchcock Presents to highlights from the last Rose Bowl.
The Nano
I can tick off the Nano’s weight (1.5 ounces) and dimensions (just 3.5-by-1.6
by-0.27 inches). But you don’t truly appreciate how tantalizingly small that is
until you place a Nano (see Figure 14-2) next to a grown-up iPod. Of course,
giving in on size means giving up some song capacity. The largest capacity
Nano can hold around 1,000 songs.
Figure 14-1:
The iPod.
213
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

Still, if you’re looking for an iPod so small you’re not even sure whether it’s
still in your pocket, Nano is the choice. Like it’s full-size cousin, Nano sports a
version of the scroll wheel. It can show off pictures too (but not videos).
Nano, which starts at $149, comes in two flavors, black or customary iPod
white.
The iPod Shuffle
Starting at just $69 and smaller than a pack of Trident, Shuffle (see Figure 14-3)
gets its name from the shuffle setting found on larger iPods, compact disc
players, and other musical devices. Songs on the device play in random order.
Moreover, because the Shuffle has no display, the only way to tell what’s play-
ing, assuming you don’t know just by listening, is to connect Shuffle to your
Mac (or Windows machine) through its built-in USB connector. That connec-
tor is revealed when you lift off Shuffle’s white cap. Incidentally, unlike the
hard-drive-based video iPod, Shuffle employs what’s called flash memory; so
the least expensive model is limited to around 120 songs.

iTunes: The Great Mac Jukebox
As stand-alone devices, iPods are wonderful examples of exemplary design
and superb engineering. But though the iPod name signifies star power, it
must share (and truth be told probably relinquish) top billing to the maestro
behind Apple’s musical ensemble, iTunes software.
If the iPod is Lennon, Apple’s multimedia jukebox program is McCartney. Or it
is Mick to Keith? Or Rodgers to Hammerstein? Well you get the drift; the little
player and Apple’s software make terrific music together.
Best of all, as part of the iLife suite, iTunes is one of those melodious programs
that musical enthusiasts (and everyone else) get just for owning a Mac.

Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

Here’s a quick rundown on what iTunes permits you to do, with further com-
mentary to come later in this chapter:
 Listen to CDs
 Rip, or encode, the songs on a CD into music files that are compressed
(see the “Compassionate compression” sidebar) and stored in your 
digital library
 Add music to the library from the Internet
 Create, or burn, your own CDs or DVDs, with the proper CD or DVD
burner, such as Apple’s own Super Drive, which is included in some
Macs
 Listen to Internet radio by clicking the Radio icon in the source list to
display a list of streams by category, such as Alt/Modern Rock, Blues,
and Electronica
 Watch videos
 Organize your music by name, artist, time, album, genre, rating, and
play-count
 Segregate your music into customized playlists
 Stream or share the music in your library across a network — within 
certain limitations
 Transfer music onto an iPod
To open iTunes, click the Dock icon, which looks like a musical note resting
on top of a CD.
Let’s explore some of the iTunes controls referenced in Figure 14-4:
 Back/Forward: The double-arrow pointing to the left and right respec-
tively are your back and forward buttons. Place the cursor above these
buttons and hold down the mouse to rewind or fast-forward through a
song. If you instead single-click on these arrows, you’ll advance or
retreat to the next or previous track.
 Play/Pause: Click the single arrow pointing to the right to play a song.
When a song is playing, the button changes to two vertical bars. Click
again to stop the music. Alternatively, press the spacebar to play or
pause.

 Volume: Dragging this slider increases or decreases the volume.
 Shuffle: When the symbol in this little button is highlighted (it turns
blue), tracks play in random order. Be prepared for anything. There’s no
telling when Eminem will follow The Wiggles.
 Repeat: Click once to repeat all the songs in the library or playlist you’re
currently listening to. Click twice so that the number 1 appears on the
button. Only the current track will repeat.
 Equalizer: If you’ve ever tweaked the treble and bass controls on a
stereo, you’ll appreciate the equalizer. It allows you to adjust sound fre-
quencies to match the genre of a song, the speakers on your system, or
the ambiance of the room in which you are listening. Clicking the equal-
izer button brings up the list shown in Figure 14-5. You can manually
adjust the equalizer by dragging the sliders or choose among more than
20 presets (such as Bass reducer, Flat, Hip-Hop, or Lounge).
 Visual Effects: If you were conscious during the ’60s, you’ll welcome
these funky psychedelic light animations that dance to the beat of what-
ever’s playing, as shown in Figure 14-6. And if you’re the offspring of a
Baby Boomer, you’ll arrive at this amazing realization: Maybe mom and
dad were pretty groovy in their heyday. You can also drum up your
visual serenade by pressing Ô+T. For a full-screen effect when the visual-
izer is active, press Ô+F; press Esc, or click the mouse button to return
to reality.

Managing Your Music
So how exactly does music make its way into iTunes? And what exactly
comes of the songs after you have ’em? I thought you’d never ask.
Ripping audio CDs
A remarkable thing happens moments after you insert the vast majority of
music CDs into your Mac. The contents of the disc — song titles, artist name,
length, album name, and genre — are automatically recognized and copied
into iTunes. The software actually fetches this licensed information from a
massive online database run by a company called Gracenote.
Now here’s another remarkable feat: Next time, you won’t have to keep
inserting said CD into the computer to hear its music. That’s because you can
rip, or copy, the contents onto the Mac’s hard drive, and then stash the disc
somewhere else.
Figure 14-6:
Psychedelic
light
animations.
219
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

To rip a CD, click the Import CD button in the upper-right corner of the
window. Because all songs with a check mark next to their name will be
copied, be sure to click to uncheck any songs you have no interest in before
proceeding.
As iTunes goes about its business, a tiny orange circle spins next to the song
being ripped; the circle turns green and gains a check mark after it’s been
copied. You can monitor the progress of your imports also by peeking at the
top display shown in Figure 14-7. It shows you how much time remains before
a particular track is captured and the speed at which the CD is being ripped.
Incidentally, you can listen to the CD (or do other work) while ripping a disc.
After iTunes has completed its mission, remove the CD by clicking Eject (the
rightmost icon at the bottom of the screen). Copied songs are stored in the
iTunes library.
Figure 14-7:
Ripping 
a CD.
220
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Importing other ditties
Songs previously downloaded from the Internet can be imported into iTunes
by dragging them into your iTunes library. The assumption here is that you
obtained those music files legally. If you did not, placing them inside iTunes
will blow up your computer. (That’s not really the case, but I urge you to play
by the rules just the same. People’s livelihoods depend on it.)
To import audio files from other applications or your desktop, choose
File➪Add to Library and then select the file. Or drag the music into the
Library, or the iTunes Dock icon.
Creating playlists
You listen to music under a variety of circumstances, such as entertaining at
a dinner party, soothing a crying baby, setting a romantic mood, or drowning
in your sorrows after a painful breakup. In the last situation, the last thing
you’d want to hear is Barbra Streisand belting out “Happy Days Are Here
Again,” even if the song is otherwise a staple in your iTunes library. With a
playlist, you can organize material around a particular theme or mood.
The simplest way to create a new playlist is to click the + button in the
bottom-left corner of the iTunes window. You can also choose File➪New
Playlist or press the keyboard tandem Ô+N.
A new playlist with the inelegant name “Untitled playlist” appears in the
source list. Type over that with the name of the playlist you have in mind
(Jazz Crooners, Dance Mix, Corny Songs, or whatever). Then merely drag the
songs from the library into the folder representing the new playlist.
If you’re adding multiple songs into the playlist, hold down the Ô or Shift key
to select a bunch of tracks. You can drag the whole batch over in one swoop.
To delete a song from a playlist, highlight it and press Delete. Don’t worry,
the original track remains in your library. Songs in playlists never really leave
the library; the playlist merely functions as a pointer to those files. For the
same reason, a particular song can show up in as many playlists as you want.
221
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

When playlists get smart
Putting together a playlist can be fun. But it can also take considerable time
and effort. Using smart playlists, you can have iTunes do the heavy lifting on
your behalf, based on specific conditions you establish upfront: how fast a
song is (based on BPM, or beats per minute), the type of music, a song’s
rating, and so on. You can also limit the playlist to a specific length.
Choose File➪New Smart Playlist. In the dialog box that appears, click Add (+)
to choose the parameters you’re basing the smart playlist on from pop up
menus. Click the – button to remove a condition.
Take a look at the Smart Playlist Figure 14-8. It has iTunes looking for all
songs with Love in the title that you haven’t heard in a couple of months or
heard more than 14 times. The song must have been encoded with a bit rate
between 128 and 160 Kbps (see the “Compassionate compression” sidebar).
The overall length of the playlist cannot exceed 2 hours. If you want iTunes to
alter the smart playlist as songs are added or removed, select the Live
Updating option.
Loading tunes onto the iPod
Transferring your songs, playlists, and — as you’ll also see — videos, audio-
books, and podcasts to an iPod is as simple as connecting the device to your
Mac through USB or FireWire, depending on the iPod model. Each time you
connect, the iPod automatically mirrors any changes to your songs and
playlists in iTunes, unless you select Manually Manage Songs and Playlists
under the iPod section of iTunes Preferences, found in the iTunes menu.

next to the name of your iPod in the source list before removing the device
from a USB or FireWire cable. (Connecting a photo-capable iPod also trans-
fers pictures from iPhoto, the star of the next chapter.)
Burning audio CDs
Knowing how to create a playlist is a handy precursor to burning or creating
your own CD that can be played in virtually any standard compact disc player.
To burn a CD:
1. From the iTunes menu, click Preferences, and then click the
Advanced tab.
2. Click Burning.
223
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation
Compassionate compression
iTunes can sing to a variety of audio file formats.
Most digital tracks imported into the iTunes
database are compressed, or shrunken, so the
music doesn’t hog an inordinate amount of
space on your hard drive. But there’s generally
a tradeoff between file size and sound quality.
As you might imagine, larger files offer the finest
sonic fidelity. At least in theory.
The best known of these compression schemes
is MP3, a method in which files are squeezed to
a reasonable size, even though the sound is per-
fectly acceptable to all but the most serious
audiophiles.
Apple prefers an alternate compression
method. On Macs with QuickTime 6.2 or later,
Apple uses a default encoding scheme known
as MPEG-4 AAC (Advanced Audio Coding), a
compression format that rivals the sound qual-
ity of an audio CD, and one that Apple claims is
equal if not superior to MP3s encoded at the
same or a higher bit rate. (If you have an earlier
version of QuickTime, MP3 is the default.)
The songs you purchase at the iTunes Music
Store are also in the AAC format. According to
Apple, the High Quality AAC setting produces
files that take up less than 1 megabyte for each
minute of music. But iTunes also recognizes
other file formats: Apple Lossless, AIFF, and
WAV. These last two flavors are uncompressed,
so the music is of exceptional quality, but the
files gobble up disk space. Apple Lossless is an
audiophile format that matches AIFF and WAV
in sound quality but takes up half the space. You
can burn CDs in the Lossless or AIFF formats.
If you’re inclined to mess with these file formats,
visit iTunes Preferences, click the Advanced
tab, and make your choice in the Importing sec-
tion. You can set up the encoder to import using
AAC, AIFF, Apple Lossless, MP3, or WAV, and
also choose the stereo bit rate. In techie terms,
128 kbps is the default.

3. For the Disc Format, select Audio CD.
4. Choose the gap between songs (from 0 to 5 seconds).
5. If you want all the songs on the CD to play at the same volume, click
Sound Check.
6. With those preliminaries out the way, choose the playlist with the
songs you want to burn and make sure all the tunes you want have
check marks next to their names.
Be mindful of the length of those tracks; regular CDs have room for
about 74 to 80 minutes of music, or approximately 20 songs.
7. When you’re ready, click the Burn Disc button in the upper-right
corner.
8. When instructed insert a blank disc.
Use a CD-R disc if you want to play the CD in almost any player.
Although this type of disc can’t be erased after you’ve recorded on it, it
works in many more players than rewriteable CD-RW type discs, the kind
that can be re-recorded.
9. Click Burn Disc again.
Your CD burner chugs away. The entire procedure may take several 
minutes.
In this example, we burned an audio CD. Apple also gives you the option to
burn an MP3 CD. The advantage is that you can store a lot more music (more
than 12 hours, or 150 songs) on a typical CD-R disc. The rub: Fewer CD play-
ers can handle this type of disc.
Tuning into Internet radio
Listening to your own CDs and digital tracks is terrific. Presumably a lot of
thought went into amassing your collection.
But at times, nothing beats the serendipity of radio: Not knowing what’s
coming next, hearing a nugget you haven’t heard in decades, hearing a new
jewel for the first time.
You don’t have to leave your Mac to revel in this type of experience. In fact,
when you click Radio in the source list, you’ll have access to a heck of a lot
more radio stations than you’ll find on AM, FM, or even subscription-based
satellite radio. These are streaming Internet radio stations, and you can
choose from hundreds of them. Apple categorizes these by genre, as shown
in Figure 14-9. Click the triangle next to a category name to see all the station
options in that genre. Double-click to tune into a particular station. It starts
playing in a few seconds, mercifully minus the static of regular radio.
224
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Pay attention to the bit rate. The higher the bit rate number, the better a sta-
tion will sound, though you’re at the mercy of your Internet connection. Dial-
up users may want to stick with stations streaming at less than 48 kbps.
You can include Internet radio stations in a playlist. Of course, you must still
be connected to the Internet to hear them. Recording Internet radio streams
requires a third-party application such as RadioLover from Bitcartel Software.

Finding Music Online
iTunes serves as a gateway to a delightful emporium for music lovers. It’s the
iTunes Music Store where hunting for songs is a pleasure for all but the most
tone-deaf users. Don’t believe me? How else to explain more than a billion
downloads since Apple opened up the place? To enter the store, click Music
Store in the iTunes source list.
Sadly, you won’t find every song on your wish list in the iTunes Music Store
because some performers or the music labels that control these artists’ 
Figure 14-9:
You won’t

these on
AM or FM.
225
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

catalogues foolheartedly remain digital holdouts. They have yet to put their
records up for sale in cyberspace. No Beatles songs are listed, and Madonna
was a latecomer until she started appearing in Apple ads.
If you ask me, it smacks of greed. But then don’t get me started.
Now that I have that rant off my chest, let’s put a positive spin on buying
music online compared to doing so in the physical world. For one thing, good
as it is, your neighborhood record store isn’t going to carry the more than 2
million tracks found in the iTunes Music Store. Moreover, every tune in the
iTunes joint is always “in stock.”
Shopping online for music affords you other privileges. Most notably, you
have the opportunity to cherry-pick favorite tracks from an album, without
having to buy the entire compilation. Note, however, that some record labels
require that some tracks be purchased only as part of a full-blown album.
What’s more, you can sample all the tracks for 30 seconds, without any oblig-
ation to buy. Most of the songs that you do choose to buy cost 99¢ a pop.
Then there’s the matter of instant gratification. You can start listening to the
music you buy inside iTunes mere seconds after making a purchase, as you’ll
see later in the chapter.
Seeking online music recommendations
In a real-life music store, you might find an adolescent clerk willing to recom-
mend an album or artist. (Although why is it you have a sneaking suspicion
this kid doesn’t speak the same language you do, much less enjoy the same
repertoire?) If you get really lucky, you may come across a Julliard graduate
moonlighting between gigs. But more often than not you’re browsing the
shelves on your own, not that that’s a bad thing; I love spending time in
record stores.
But face it, we all need a little counsel now and then. You’ll find plenty of it in
the iTunes Music Store from Apple as well as from people like you who
happen to adore music.
In some respects, the front page of the Music Store is like the window outside
Tower Records. You’ll see colorful album covers, promotions for particular
artists, and more.
226
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

The page is laid out with new or recent releases, staff favorites, a list of top
songs and top albums, a few exclusives, and other recommendations — pre-
sented in the main genre you select by clicking the drop-down menu under
Inside the Music Store (on the left side of the screen).
Figure 14-10 shows the front page of the store when you’ve selected
Children’s Music as your genre.
Now suppose you click the banner where Julie Andrews is choosing her
favorite Disney ditties. You’re transported to a page like the one shown in
Figure 14-11. In the bottom half of the screen is the list of songs in her compi-
lation. Click any of these to hear 30-second samples. Now look above the
song list. You’ll find customer reviews and ratings.
Feel free to contribute your own reviews. In iTunes, everybody can be critic.

iMixes
In the last section, I mentioned that you can write your own reviews. In fact,
you can go a lot further than being a critic. You can compile a list of songs for
people with similar tastes. Throughout the Music Store, you’ll come across
top-rated iMixes, playlists created by ordinary music fans like you.
To contribute your own iMix for all the world to see in the iTunes Music
Store, follow these steps:
1. In the source list, click the little arrow to the right of a selected
playlist.
If no arrow appears, select the Show Links to Music Store option, which
is on the General tab in iTunes Preferences.
2. Click Create iMix.
3. Enter a title and a description.
You might use a title such as “Ed’s Sappy Love Songs” and a description
such as “Great sentimental music to share with a bottle of a wine and a
special friend.” Apple won’t let you use profanity.
4. Click Tell a Friend to spread the word.

Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Although your playlist can include tracks you’ve ripped from a CD, only tunes
sold in the iTunes Music Store will appear in your iMix. Apple makes the iMix
available for one year from its publish date.
You can rate other people’s iMixes on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. Accordingly, they
get to rate your compilation. If enough of them grade you favorably, your iMix
may also be featured on the album pages of featured artists. By my way of
thinking, that gives you as much credibility as any American Idol judge.
The search for great music continues
Check out the following list for other ways to stumble upon terrific music.
Make sure you have time on your hands. The quest can be deeply addictive:
 Search: A great starting point in your exploration is to search for artists
or song titles by entering the name in the Search Music Store box near
the upper-right corner of the screen. You can put more weight behind
your search by clicking Power Search from the Inside the Music Store
list. It lets you search by several parameters simultaneously (song,
artist, album, genre, and composer).
 Browse: If you’re not starting out with a particular artist in mind, click
Browse from the Inside the Music Store list. You see a window such as
the one shown in Figure 14-12. Choose a genre in the column to the left,
a subgenre in the column to its right, an artist in the next column, and so
on, until you’ve narrowed the list down to tunes you want to own.
 Top Artist Downloads: If you happen upon an album page but aren’t
familiar with the performer’s music, consult the Top Artists Downloads
list and click to hear your 30-second sample.
 Listeners also bought: If you’re impressed by what you hear from a
given artist, you may also be attracted to other music purchased by fans
of the artist’s work.
 Charts: Consult Billboard’s Top Charts for a list of the Billboard Hot 100,
Top Country, or Top R&B by year. The Billboard Top 100 dates back to
1946, when in reality it was the Top 41. Perry Como anyone?
You can also click Radio Charts to get lists of songs playing on radios
station in cities ranging from Appleton-Oshkosh to Augusta, as you can
see in Figure 14-13.

 Hobnob with the stars: Well not exactly hobnob. But an eclectic cast of
the rich and famous — Liv Tyler, Ramsey Lewis, Blondie, Jay-Z, Kiefer
Sutherland, Sharon Stone, Eurythmics, William Shatner, Bill Maher, Billy
Bob Thornton, Carole King, B.B. King, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe,
Heidi Klum, Sarah McLachlan, Jennifer Garner, Taye Diggs, Jackie Chan,
Smokey Robinson, RuPaul, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Kanye West, Sting, Al
Franken, Lance Armstrong, the Reverend Al Green, and many more —
have put together lists of their favorite works. The artists usually pro-
vide brief descriptions of why they chose certain songs, as shown in
Figure 14-14. Regrettably, purchasing songs from these celebrity playlists
is not an automatic ticket to stardom.
 Just For You: Apple is testing a service called Just For You, which has
personalized recommendations based on your past musical purchasing
habits. It’ll serve up suggestions such as “You own Groovin’. We recom-
mend: Herman’s Hermit’s Retrospective.” Or “You bought Guero. We rec-
ommend Stand Up, Dave Matthews Band.” Under each suggestion you
can click “Already Own It” or “Don’t Like It.” The idea is that as Apple
learns more about what tickles your fancy, it will provide sharper recom-
mendations over time. The company can also steer you to certain songs
through its iTunes MiniStore, as the “MiniStore, minicontroversy” side-
bar explains.
Figure 14-14:

231
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

When you’re ready to buy
So now that you have all these recommendations, you’re ready to spend
some money. First, though, you have to set up an account with Apple (assum-
ing you haven’t already done so) or use an existing AOL account. Here’s how:
1. In the Source List, click Music Store.
2. In the sign-in window, click Create New Account.
3. Fill in the requested credit card and other info.
4. The rest is easy. Find a song you want to buy and click Buy Song.
232
Part IV: Getting an iLife 
MiniStore, minicontroversy
Apple initially took some grief when it rolled out
the iTunes MiniStore as part of an iTunes soft-
ware release in January 2006. The feature is
meant to help you discover new music when
you click items in your own library. As you do so,
the MiniStore shows songs that relate to the
material you’re listening to, as shown in the
figure. Citing possible privacy breaches, how-
ever, some critics went after Apple for failing to
disclose what it was doing. In short order, Apple
alleviated the concerns by turning the MiniStore
off by default. Now you must opt-in by clicking
the Show/Hide MiniStore button (labeled in
Figure 14-4).

To make sure you really mean it, Apple serves up the warning shown in
Figure 14-15.
5. Click Buy to complete the transaction.
In a matter of seconds (usually) the song is downloaded to the aptly
named Purchased playlist.
Once a week, you can download a free single handpicked by Apple (or some-
times even more than one). The freebies are typically from artists you’ve
never heard of, though the music is usually quite good. The downloading
experience is identical to buying any track except you’re clicking Get Song
instead of Buy Song.
Apple’s generosity has a hidden cost. The company is taking the Lay’s Potato
Chip “bet you can’t eat just one” approach. The expectation is that you’ll
stick around the Music Store for awhile and part with your hard-earned
money at some point. Heck, less than a buck a track doesn’t sound like much
for those songs you just gotta have. But take it from first-hand experience,
those 99¢ tunes add up quickly. To find out just how much you’re spending,
click the Account window, enter your password, and choose View Account.
You can click Purchase History to check out your latest transactions.
If you click Manage Artist Alerts on the Account Information page, Apple will
send you e-mail letting you know when artists whose music you’ve bought in
the past have added new music to the Music Store. To do so, select the Send
Me Artist Alerts for All Artists in My Purchase History option. Just another
way to get you to part with your money.
Allowances and gifts
If you’ve bought one too many lame sweaters or neckties over the years as an
11th-hour birthday gift, iTunes may be your salvation. Click Gift Certificates
to buy something truly valuable. iTunes Gift Certificates can be issued in
amounts from $10 to $200. You can e-mail the certificate, print it, or have it go
out through the U.S. Mail. The whole shebang takes a minute or so.
Figure 14-15:
We’re happy
to take your
money 
but . . .
233
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

In the list on the left side of the Music Store under Account, click Gift
Certificates for the particulars. To redeem a certificate you’ve received, start
out at the same place.
If you click Allowance instead, you can set up a regular monthly allowance (in
the same $10 to $200 amounts) that gets automatically topped off on the first
of the each month. If all goes well, Junior will learn a thing or two about fiscal
responsibility. Unused balances are saved until your kid makes another pur-
chase. Of course, should your son or daughter abuse any privileges, you can
pull the plug on his or her iTunes allowance at any time by heading over to
the Account Information page.
You can drag songs into a playlist and give them as gifts, even if you don’t
own the songs. You hear the 30-second previews; your recipients get the full
treatment. Click the arrow next to the playlist and click Give Playlist.
You can also give an entire album inside the iTunes Music store by selecting
Gift This Music on the Album page.
Sharing music with other computers
If your Mac is part of a local computer network (see Chapter 18), you can
share the music in your library with other machines running iTunes version
4.5 or later. Go to iTunes Preferences, click Sharing, and select the Share My
Music option. You can share the entire library or selected playlists. For
added security, you can require users of other computers to enter a pass-
word. iTunes must remain open for other computers to access your music.
Limits apply, as indicated in the “Digital rights police” sidebar.
234
Part IV: Getting an iLife 
Digital rights police
When you buy a regular compact disc, you can
pretty much do with it whatever you like. Pop
the disc into as many CD players as you have
access to. Copy the songs (via iTunes) onto your
Mac. Fling the thing like a Frisbee for all anyone
cares.
So what exactly do you own when you purchase
a song electronically from iTunes? The rights to
listen to that song on just five “authorized” com-
puters. If you try to share music on a sixth
machine, you’re told you need to deauthorize one
of the previous five. To do so, make sure the com-
puter is connected to the Net. Then under the
Advanced menu in iTunes, click Deauthorize
Computer. The five-machine limit applies to
Macs as well as Windows machines. You can
also deauthorize all five machines at once by
choosing Deauthorize All on the Account
Information page. Quick takeaway: If you’re get-
ting rid of an old machine, remember to deau-
thorize it. 

iTunes: More Than Just Music
I’m wondering how long the iTunes Music Store will be known as, well, the
iTunes Music Store? iTunes Media Store seems a more accurate descriptor
because, as you know by now, you can purchase a lot more than just music,
and share it on an iPod.
Listening to audiobooks
From Ernest Hemingway to James Patterson, you can fetch the iTunes equiva-
lent of books on tape. You can sample 90-second previews, three times as long
as music selections. Of course, audio books can go on for hours, compared to
three or four minutes for your average song. Prices vary too. A 22-minute audio
of Stephen Colbert’s remarks at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner costs
$1.95; an 81⁄2-hour audio version of “Papa” Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms goes
for $25.95. Choose Audiobooks from the Inside the Music Store list and start
prowling the virtual bookshelves for interesting titles.
Capturing podcasts
Podcasts are another form of Internet radio but very different from the radio I
described earlier in this chapter. For one thing, some podcasts go beyond
radio and show video. Moreover, instead of listening to live streams via the
Net, podcasts are downloadable files you can listen to whenever you get
around to it.
As you’ll see after choosing the Podcasts genre inside iTunes, podcasts cover
a broad range of topics (business, politics, sports, TV and film, technology,
and so on) and are served up by experienced broadcasters, mainstream
media outlets (National Public Broadcasting, Newsweek, USA TODAY, Wall
Street Journal), as well as ordinary Joe’s and Josephine’s.
Podcasts are free to download and (typically) commercial free. You can fetch
individual episodes by clicking Get Episode or subscribe to podcasts that
arrive on a regular basis. As with audiobooks, you can click to hear a 90-
second sample.
You can find the podcasts you’ve downloaded by clicking Podcasts in the
Source list.
Choose the Podcasts tab under iTunes Preferences to manage your podcasts.
Among other choices, you can instruct iTunes on how often to check for new
episodes (such as daily or weekly) and how long to keep episodes you’ve
downloaded (all unplayed, most recent, last two, last five, and more). You can
also dictate which podcasts should be transferred over to an iPod.
235
Chapter 14: Living in an iTunes Nation

You can submit your own podcast directly to Apple by clicking the Submit a
Podcast link on the main iTunes page. You’ll have to provide the podcast’s
RSS feed. Apple reserves the right to review podcasts before posting them.
You can create a podcast through GarageBand software, as I elaborate on in
Chapter 17.
Catching up on Lost and 
Desperate Housewives
Quick story. I had never seen the hit series Lost before downloading the pilot
episode onto iTunes (and then an iPod). I was instantly hooked. I immedi-
ately understood the power of iTunes/iPod video.
Lost and Desperate Housewives were among the first handful of TV shows that
Apple made available on iTunes. The number of programs quickly mush-
roomed to incorporate everything from The Daily Show with Jon Stewart to
NASCAR highlights. Music videos and short films are also available.
Videos inside iTunes cost $1.99 apiece; as with audio tracks you can sample
30-second previews.
You can drag movie or video files you create yourself or obtain from other
sources into iTunes.
Before you can transfer some videos to an iPod, you may have to convert
them to a format iPod recognizes. Select the video, and choose
Advanced➪Convert Selection for iPod.
As video becomes even more prevalent, you’ll see a lot of those earbud
people gazing intently at their iPod displays.

 Preserving your digital pictures
D
isruptive technology is a concept that has been floating around for nearly
a decade. Loosely defined, it describes how a once dominant technol-
ogy gets elbowed aside and eventually displaced by something new. The idea
was coined by Harvard B-School professor Clayton M. Christensen, and those
Ivy educators are pretty darn smart.
Disruptive technology is just what seems to be happening in the world of
photography, where digital cameras have dramatically overtaken the film
side of the picture-taking biz. Ever cheaper and more capable cameras are
becoming so pervasive that they’re even built into numerous mass-market
cell phones.
For consumers, digital cameras afford lots of advantages over their film coun-
terparts. Most notably, you can preview shots before you ever snap an image.
(Try that one with your old man’s Instamatic.) What’s more, if you aren’t
pleased with the results after taking the picture — for goodness sakes, one kid
is looking sideways and the other has her eyes shut — you can erase it on the
spot with no harm done and without having to pay to get the shot developed.

With iPhoto, Apple brings its own special smarts to digital photography. The
program is part digital shoebox, part processing lab, part touch-up artist, and
more. Through this wondrous member of the iLife suite, you can import,
organize, view, edit, and ultimately share your masterpieces with an adoring
public (or, at the very least, family and friends).
Getting Pictures into the Computer
Taking pictures with most digital cameras is a snap. Taking good digital pictures
is another matter entirely and beyond the — pun alert — focus of this book.
When you press your digital camera’s shutter button, images are typically
captured onto small (and removable) memory cards. Even as the price of
memory declines, the capacity on these cards rises. You can now capture
many hundreds of pictures on relatively inexpensive cards.
In the past, it was a challenge to get digital images onto your computer,
where the real fun begins. iPhoto drastically simplifies the process. Take a
gaze at Figure 15-1 to familiarize yourself with some of the program’s main
elements. There’s a lot here, which we’ll delve into throughout this chapter.
Connecting a digital camera
In most cases, you run a direct connection from the digital camera to the Mac
by connecting the USB cable supplied with the camera. Turn the camera off
and then plug one end of the cable into the camera and the other end into the
Mac. Turn the camera back on.
iPhoto opens, assuming you clicked Yes when the program asked you
whether you want to use iPhoto to download photos when a camera is con-
nected. (This questions pops up the first time you launch the program.) The
way iPhoto takes charge, you won’t even have to install the software that
came with your camera. Given how cumbersome some of these programs can
be, that, my friends, is a blessing.

Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

If everything went down as it should and iPhoto was called into action, skip
ahead to the next section. If you ran into a problem, you can try the following:
 Check to make sure your camera is turned on and you have a fresh set of
batteries.
 Because every camera is different, consult the instructions that came
with your model to make sure it’s in the proper setting for importing pic-
tures (usually Play mode). Don’t you just hate when that happens? You
want an answer now, and here I am directing you to some manual that
was likely translated into English from another language. Translated
poorly, I might add.
 As a last resort, make sure your camera is compatible with OS X by visit-
ing www.apple.com/macosx/upgrade/cameras.html.
Importing images from the camera
When you connect a camera and iPhoto comes to life, the main screen will
indicate that it’s ready to import images, as you can see in Figure 15-2.
Figure 15-2:
Getting
ready to
import your
pictures.
240
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

To transfer images, follow these steps:
1. Type a Roll Name and Description for your photos in the appropriate
fields.
2. Determine whether you want to erase the pictures from the camera
after they have been copied onto iPhoto.
To do so, select the Delete Items from Camera After Importing option. If
you’re not sure, you can always delete images directly from the camera
later.
3. Click Import.
Your pictures are on their way to their new home inside iPhoto’s digital
shoebox; the process may take several minutes depending on how many
pictures you’re moving over. The time depends on a variety of factors,
including the number and quality of the images being imported. You’ll
see the images whiz by as they’re being copied.
4. When the program has finished importing, click the eject button or
drag the camera’s name from the source list to iPhoto trash, at the
bottom of the source list.
5. Turn off and disconnect the camera.
Seeing double? If iPhoto detects a duplicate photo it will ask whether you’re
sure you want to copy it over again. Click Import to proceed or Don’t Import
to skip this particular image. To avoid getting this question for each duplicate
image, select the Apply to All Duplicates option.
iPhoto will also copy over movie clips from your digital camera, provided
they’re compatible with QuickTime. These videos are automatically trans-
ferred in the same way as still images.
Importing images from other sources
Not all the pictures in your iPhoto library arrive by direct transfer from your
digital camera. Some reach the Mac by the Web, e-mail, CDs or DVDs, flash
drives, or memory card readers. Other pictures may already reside some
place else on your hard drive.
To get these pictures into iPhoto, simply drag them into the iPhoto viewing
area or onto the iPhoto dock icon. You can drag individual pictures or an
entire folder or disk.
241
Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

If you prefer, choose File➪Import to Library and browse for the files you want
to bring over. Then click Import.
iPhoto is compatible with JPEG and TIFF, the most common image file for-
mats, as well as a photo enthusiast format (available on some digital cam-
eras) known as RAW.
If you haven’t bought a digital camera yet and are shooting 35mm film, you
can still play in iPhoto’s sandbox. Have your neighborhood film processor
transfer images onto a CD or post them on the Web. Given where the film pro-
cessing industry is heading, it’ll be thrilled to have your business.
Finding and Organizing Images
Right from the outset, iPhoto helps you organize pics so you can more easily
find the ones you want to view later. All the imported pictures are stuffed in
the iPhoto library, which you can easily access by clicking Library in the
source list on the upper-left side of the screen.
Your entire image collection shows up in a grid of thumbnails, or mini pic-
tures, in the main viewing area on the right. If you’re having trouble making
out those thumbnails, drag the slider at the bottom-right corner and watch
how those thumbnails grow. Cool, huh? Now drag the slider to the left to
make the pictures shrink. You can peek at many more pictures in the viewing
area that way.
Double-click a photo to make it larger. Click Done to return to the thumbnail
view.
Movie thumbnails appear with a little camera icon and the duration of the
clip. Clicking a movie thumbnail opens the QuickTime Player.
Oh, and don’t worry about your photo library growing too large, no matter
how prolific a photographer you may be. Version 6 of iPhoto can accommo-
date up to 250,000 pictures. To convince you that that’s a very big number,
Apple’s marketers point out that you can take 1,000 snapshots a month for 20
years and still not bump up against the limit.
Of course, if all Apple did was drop all those pictures into one large digital
dumping ground, you’d have a heck of a time finding that oh-so-precious shot
of your proud kid getting her elementary school diploma. So how do you
uncover the very images you want to admire over and over? Let us count 
the ways.
242
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

For starters, iPhoto organizes pictures into virtual film rolls. Remember when
you imported pictures and were asked to fill in a Roll Name? You’d be wise to
fill in something descriptive (such as Paris Vacation) because months from
now collections called “Roll 07” or “Roll 359” won’t be very revealing.
Apple automatically creates some rolls on your behalf. For instance, to help
you locate the batch of pictures you just imported, iPhoto conveniently
places them into a folder named Last Roll. If you click Last Roll in the source
list, those are the only photographs you’ll see.
If you’re looking for the pictures you took during, say, the past year instead,
click the Last 12 Months roll.
Go to Preferences under the iPhoto menu and click the General tab if you
want to change what’s shown in the source list from Last 12 Months to an
album containing photos in the Last 1 to 19 months.
In the same section, you change the source list display from Last Roll to Last
2, 3, 4, all the way up to 25 rolls.
Navigating with the iPhoto calendar
Now suppose you want to display just the pictures you took around the time
your little angel was born. Click the calendar icon at the bottom-left corner of
the screen and scroll to the month and date in which you want to display pic-
tures, as shown in Figure 15-3.
iPhoto captures more than just photos when picture files are transferred
over. Through captured metadata, the program knows the make and model of
the camera used to take the image; the date and time the picture was taken
and imported; the size in pixels, or picture elements; the aperture setting of
the camera; whether a flash was used; and more. Such data is factored into
Spotlight searches.

Navigating with the Scroll Guide
You can scan for pictures in your library taken during a specific period by
dragging the scroll bar on the right edge of the iPhoto screen. As you do so, a
floating translucent panel called Scroll Guide appears in the middle of the
window showing you the date and (depending on preferences) title of each
film roll.
Assigning keywords
Keywords may be the key to finding pictures in the future. These are labels, or
tags, applied to a set of photos. Apple provides some keywords right off the
bat: Favorite, Family, Kids, Vacation, and Birthday. You create your own key-
words by selecting the Keywords tab under iPhoto Preferences (see Figure
15-4) and clicking the + (Add) button.
Above the list of keywords is a check mark. Its purpose is to flag all the
photos you may want to pull together for a specific project. The check mark
shows up in the bottom-right corner of a thumbnail on selected images.
To actually assign keywords (or the check mark) to specific photos:
1. Select the specific picture.
2. Choose Photos➪Get Info.
3. Make sure the Keywords Tab option under Get Info is highlighted.
Figure 15-4:
The key to
keywords.
244
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

4. Place a check mark next to the keyword (or keywords) you want to
use for the image. 
As an alternative to Steps 2 to 4, open the keywords pane on the bottom-
left corner of the screen by clicking the button that looks like, well, a
key. Drag the photo onto the appropriate keyword.
Now that the underlying keywords are in place, how the heck do you put
them into action? Open the keywords pane and click one or more of the key-
word buttons. The clicked buttons turn blue, and the iPhoto viewer displays
only those pictures that match the highlighted keywords.
Now suppose that you want to display pictures that match one keyword or
another (Family or Vacation, for example). This time, click the keywords in
question while also holding down the Shift key. The keys turn purple. Again,
the viewer will show only the appropriate collection of pictures.
If you want to hide pictures with certain keywords — I won’t ask, so don’t tell —
press Option on the keyboard while clicking the keyword or keywords you want
to hide. The keyword buttons turn red, and pictures represented by those key-
words are not shown.
Assigning ratings
You can also assign ratings to pictures on a scale between zero and five stars.
There are several ways to do this with selected images:
 Choose Photos➪My Rating and click the number of stars you have in
mind.
 Open the Information pane by clicking the little circled i button near the
bottom-left corner of the screen, and then click the representative dot
next to Rating.
 While holding down the Ô key, press the 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 key (representing
the number of stars) on the keyboard.
Placing your work into albums
In the film age, really organized people took the time to methodically place
prints into old-fashioned picture albums. I admire people like that because I
lack this particular organizing gene.
245
Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

Fortunately, the iPhoto equivalent of lumping pictures into albums is much
simpler. The process is similar to creating playlists in iTunes (see Chapter
14). So you can place all the pictures from your ski trip in one album, pictures
of the high school reunion in another, and so on. Here’s the drill:
1. Choose File➪New Album, or click the + button at the bottom-left
corner of the iPhoto screen.
2. Type a name for your album (Hawaii Honeymoon, Dance Recital,
whatever)
3. Click Create.
The name of your new album shows up in the source list. Now you have to
populate that album with pictures, as follows:
 Drag individual photos onto the Album name or icon in the source list.
 To select a batch of photos to drag over, hold down the Ô key while
clicking the pictures you want to include.
 To select adjoining photos, hold down the Shift key and use the arrow
buttons.
 To select all the photos between two photos, hold down Shift and click
the first image, then hold Shift and click the last image. All the pictures
in between will be selected.
As you drag a batch of photos en masse to the album, a little red circle indi-
cates how many pictures you’re moving over.
If you want to select the photos before creating an album, select the pics and
then choose File➪New Album From Selection.
Although photos are lumped into albums, the pictures actually remain in the
iPhoto library. The images inside albums are merely pointers to the original
files. So you can place the same picture in multiple albums. You can also
remove pictures from an album without fear that the images will be deep-
sixed from the iPhoto library.
After you create a bunch of albums, you can group them into a folder. Choose
File➪New Folder. Give the folder a name (such as Vacations) and drag all the
relevant albums into the folder. When you select the newly created folder,
you’ll see all the pictures stored in all the albums contained in that folder.

Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Creating a smart photo album
Just as you can create smart playlists in iTunes, you can sire smart albums in
iPhoto based on specific criteria, such as keywords, photos you’ve rated
highly, pictures taken with a particular camera, or the shutter speed. To
create a smart album:
1. Choose File➪New Smart Album.
2. Type a name, just as you do with a regular album.
3. Select the conditions that must be met for pictures to be included in
the Smart Album. 
Click the + button to add matching criteria or the – button to remove cri-
teria. As new pictures are imported to your library, those that match
these conditions are added automatically to the smart album.
In Figure 15-5, I’ve set up a smart album seeking only highly rated pictures
taken without a flash at the beach since the end of 2004.
Viewing pictures
In the main viewing area, photos are displayed in the order in which you
imported them. If you want to change the order, choose View➪Sort Photos,
and then choose an option, such as By Film Roll or By Rating.
Under the View menu, you can also decide whether to display the titles, key-
words, film rolls, and ratings of your photos.

Touching Up Your Photos
Here’s a dirty little secret. The drop-dead gorgeous models gracing the
covers of magazines don’t really look like that. (Well maybe some do, but
work with me here.) The unsung heroes are the touch-up artists, who remove
a flaw from a picture here, a blemish there. We should all be so lucky to be
able to put our own mugs in the best light. And lucky we are for having
iPhoto on the Mac.
Now iPhoto is by no means a photo editing superstar along the lines of
Adobe’s Photoshop. But for the mainstream snapshooter, iPhoto comes with
several handy editing tools for removing red eye or applying special effects.
We’ll get around to these in a moment. But first let’s examine a new majestic
way to display your images in iPhoto that can help you take advantage of
every last pixel.
The full-screen treatment
In iPhoto 6, Apple added a full-screen viewing option that takes advantage of
today’s large and beautiful computer displays. What’s more, Apple lets you
edit in this mode.
To enter the full-screen edit mode, select a photo from the main viewing area
and click the full screen button (labeled in Figure 15-1). When you roll your
mouse at the top of the screen, a strip of thumbnails called the photo browser
(see Figure 15-6) slides in and out of view. Roll your mouse to the bottom of
the screen to slide the various editing tools into view.
You can compare between two and eight photos in the full-screen view by
holding Ô while clicking thumbnails in the photo browser. If you click the
Compare button instead, the photo you choose is compared with the one to
its immediate right.
If you prefer the full-screen view all the time, go to iPhoto Preferences and
click the General tab. Under the Edit Photo drop-down list, select Using Full
Screen.
248
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

To exit the full-screen mode, press the Escape key on the keyboard.
If you want to edit photos from the conventional view instead, double-click a
thumbnail in the viewing area, and the same editing tools you see in the full
screen view appear below the selected image. Alternatively, highlight a pic-
ture and click Edit in the menu bar.
Let’s have a look at some of those editing buttons now.

Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

Rotating an image
Sometimes the picture that turns up in the photo library is oriented incor-
rectly because of the way you rotated the camera when shooting the original.
To fix the orientation in iPhoto, select the image and click Rotate on the edit-
ing toolbar, at the bottom of the screen. The image rotates counterclockwise
by 90 degrees. Keep clicking until the picture is oriented properly. Press the
Option key while clicking to make the picture flip the other way.
Cropping an image
Cropping means snipping away at the periphery of an image, so you can get
up close and personal to the subject at hand while removing traces of that
Yo-Yo in the background who is sticking his tongue out.
To crop an image:
1. Click Crop on the editing toolbar.
2. Choose the cropping area:
• To choose your own cropping area, click None from the Constrain
menu. Move your pointer over the image and drag it diagonally
across the area of the image you want to keep.
• To limit the crop area to a specific dimension, click Constrain and
make a selection.
Among the choices, select 4 x 6 for a postcard, 20 x 30 for a poster,
or 4 x 3 if you plan on using the picture in a coffee table book,
which I discuss later this chapter. iPhoto puts a translucent gray
border around the potential cropping area.
3. Use the mouse to drag the crop area into the proper position.
4. Click Crop and then Done to save your changes.
If you’re unhappy with a newly cropped picture, choose Edit➪Undo (or press
Ô+Z). And at any time, you can choose Photos➪Revert to Original and pre-
tend like nothing happened.
If you want to crop an image and keep the original, choose Photos➪Duplicate.
Give the cloned picture a name and use it to do your cropping.

Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Repairing blemishes
What do you do when that otherwise immaculate portrait is ruined by a small
stain on your sweater? Or the sudden appearance on your face of the zit that
ate Cincinnati?
Click Retouch on the editing toolbar to turn on iPhoto’s high-tech spot
remover or software airbrush. Hold down the mouse button and use the
crosshair pointer to brush over the freckle, blotch, or pimple. iPhoto paints
over these spots using surrounding colors. Use short strokes to avoid smear-
ing an image and making the picture appear even more ghoulish. Click
Retouch again when you’re finished.
Retouching larger images is easier than smaller ones, making full-screen
mode all the more valuable when editing thusly. Still (I hate to be the one to
tell you this), getting rid of minor defects won’t win you a modeling contract.
Press the Control key to toggle and compare your touch-up job with the origi-
nal picture. As before if you’re not pleased with the result, you can Revert to
Original.
Enhance and adjust
The quick fix Enhance tool automatically brightens a faded or too-dark image
or adjusts one that’s too bright by correcting the image’s color saturation
and tint. Click the Enhance button once, and iPhoto does the rest.
In reality, the picture isn’t always enhanced, but as usual you have a variety
of undo options. And again, press and release the Control key to easily com-
pare the new image with the old.
While iPhoto does all the work for you inside Enhance, Adjust puts the onus
on you. Clicking Adjust brings up a palette like the one shown in Figure 15-7.
Manually drag the sliders to adjust the brightness, contrast, sharpness, expo-
sure, and other settings. If you get totally lost after mucking with these set-
tings, click Reset Sliders to start from scratch.
251
Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

Reducing red-eye
Flash photography often results in red-eye, where it looks like your subject is
auditioning for the lead role in Rosemary’s Baby: All Grown Up. Fortunately,
iPhoto, like Visine, can get the red out.
The operation is devilishly simple. Click the Red-Eye button and place the
crosshairs pointer in the center of each red eye. Use the size slider to zoom
in on each reddened pupil and click. Click the Red-Eye button again to com-
plete the exorcism.
Special effects
Clicking the Effects button brings up a tic-tac-toe style panel with eight one-
click special effects (a ninth button, in the center, brings the photo back to its
Original state).
Black & White, Sepia, and Antique (an aging effect) affect the actual image. So
do Fade Color, which lessens the color intensity in a photo, and Boost Color,
which has the opposite effect. You can repeatedly click the mouse to lay on
the effects even more. Clicking Matte, Vignette, and Edge Blur alter the edges
of the picture.

Admiring and Sharing Pictures
Until now, we’ve been speaking of organizing and doctoring images. But
enough of that. It’s time to sit back and admire our handiwork. And then
show off our Ansel Adams skills to everyone else.
Creating slideshows
If you’re of a certain generation, you may remember having to sit still while
your parents pulled out the Kodak Carousel Slide Projector. “There we are in
front of the Grand Canyon. There we are in front of the Grand Canyon — from
a slightly different angle.”
The 21st-century slideshow, care of a Macintosh, brings a lot more pizzazz.
Your pictures are backed with a soundtrack right out of your iTunes library.
You can slowly zoom in and out of photos employing the Ken Burns Effect,
named after the documentary filmmaker.
To create a slide show, follow these steps:
1. Choose the album or groups of photos you want in your show.
2. Click the Slideshow button on the toolbar.
3. Select the order you want photos in the show to appear by dragging
them on the photo browser.
4. Click Music to choose a soundtrack from iTunes, GarageBand (Chapter
17), or from sample music included with iPhoto.
5. Click Settings and make your selections.
You can choose how long you want to play each slide (3 seconds is the
default) and choose a transition between slides (Dissolve, Page Flip,
Twirl, and so on). Remove the check mark if you don’t want to use the
Automatic Ken Burns Effect. Add check marks if you want to scale photos
to fit the screen, and show titles, ratings, and slideshow controls. You can
also choose whether to repeat music during the slideshow or whether to
adjust slide durations so they will play as long as the music plays.
6. When you’re satisfied with the settings, click OK.
7. If you want to tweak settings for individual slides, click Adjust.
8. To preview visual changes to slides in a smaller window without
sound, click Preview.
9. Click Play to get on with the show.
253
Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

You can rotate and rate pictures in a slideshow on-the-fly or pause the show
by moving your cursor onto the screen.
You can also burn your slideshow to a DVD or export it to a QuickTime
movie. We’ll talk more about burning DVDs in Chapter 16.
E-mailing pictures
To send pictures using e-mail, highlight an image in your library or in an
album and click the Email button on the editing toolbar. Or hold down the 
Ô key to select a bunch of photos to e-mail.
You’ll be asked to choose a size for the photo (small, medium, large, or actual
size) in the dialog box that appears in Figure 15-8.
Smaller files are faster to send and download; the larger files boast superior
quality but may not slip past your ISP’s server size limitations.
Before clicking Compose, decide whether you want to include the titles and
comments with your photo by selecting those options (or not).
Click Compose. Tiger’s Mail program opens with the picture already attached
(assuming Mail is your default e-mail application). Fill in the recipient’s
address, type a subject line, and add any additional prose before sending the
picture on its merry way.
Visit iPhoto Preferences if you want to send e-mail through another Mail pro-
gram such as AOL or Eudora. 
You can also e-mail pictures as attachments through such Web-based e-mail
programs as Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo! Mail.

Booking them
There aren’t many guarantees in life. But one of them is that bound coffee-
table photo books of the family make splendid presents. Apple makes it a
breeze to design these professionally printed 81⁄2-by-11-inch books. And when
the grandparents see what you produced, don’t be shocked if they ask how
come you’re not working in the publishing business.
From iPhoto, you choose the size and design of these books and of course
choose the batch of photos to be included. Images are sent out over the
Internet to a printing plant, which binds and ships the book (within days) on
your behalf to its final destination.
As of this writing, Apple’s hardcover photo books start around $30 (for 10
pages). Medium and large softcover versions start at $10 to $20, respectively.
Small-sized 2.6-by-3.5-inch books (sold three books at a time) fetch $12. 
Here’s how to go about designing a photo book:
1. Choose the photos you want in the book.
2. Click the Book button on the editing toolbar.
The Book Type dialog box appears.
3. Select the size of your book, and whether you want double-sided
pages.
4. Choose a book design.
Among your choices are Picture Book, Formal, Travel, Baby Boy, and
Baby Girl. Some themes let you type text with your pictures. For detailed
descriptions, click the Options + Pricing button 
5. Click Choose Theme.
You are now in book view. Figure 15-9 shows the current page of your
book in the main iPhoto viewer, below a thumbnail strip of pictures you
can manually drag onto photo placeholders in the page layouts.
6. If you want to fatten your book, click Add Pages on the editing 
toolbar.
7. To determine the layout of pictures on a page and whether to add
text, click Page Design.
If you want iPhoto to arrange your book for you (it’s not nearly as much
fun), choose Autoflow.
8. When you’re satisfied, click Buy Book to enter credit card and ship-
ping information.
255
Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

You can also turn your book into a slideshow. Choose the book from the
source list and click the Play button. Click Settings to change transitions,
choose background music, and tweak other effects, as described with regular
slideshows earlier in this section.
Cards and calendars
Choose the Order Prints button to — this isn’t a trick question — order
prints directly from Kodak. You can choose various sizes, of course. You need
an Apple account with Enable 1-Click Purchasing. (You’ll be taken through the
account process the first time you order.)
You can design a customized calendar (up to 24 months) by choosing a
Theme (some with text), a start date, and whether to add national holidays
(from about three dozen countries). You can also import your iCal calendars
as well as birthdays from your Address Book.
An 8-by-10-inch 12-month calendar costs around $20.

Photocasting
What if your first child was born recently and you want to share images of
the adorable infant with everyone. It’s not practical to invite them all over to
your house to view albums (unless they’re willing to take turns changing dia-
pers). And e-mailing the pictures to your entire extended family isn’t practi-
cal given your lack of sleep.
Lots of online sites let you upload pictures to share with others. But what if
you could “publish” an album so that pictures instantly appear in other
people’s iPhoto 6 library? What if anyone with an RSS reader (see Chapter 11)
who “subscribes” to your album could also view the pictures? And what if
each time you add or alter pictures in the album, the people given access will
also see those changes?
You now have an understanding of the power of photocasting, an especially
nifty feature introduced with iPhoto 6. Think podcasting for pictures. For
some of you, photocasting might be the single best reason to sign up for a
.Mac membership. 
Here’s how this particular bit of magic works:
1. Choose the Album you want to share.
2. Choose Share➪Photocast. 
The dialog box shown in Figure 15-10 appears.
Figure 15-10:
Publishing a

257
Chapter 15: Taking an iPhoto Close-Up

3. Choose a size for your photos (small, medium, large, actual size).
4. If you want the photocast to be constantly refreshed, select the
Automatically Update When Album Changes option.
5. If you want to restrict access, select the Require Name and Password
option and fill them in.
6. Click Publish.
A little circle turns up in the source list to let you know the photocast
operation is underway. If your album contains a lot of pictures, the
process may take awhile to complete. A dialog box appears with the URL
or Web address to subscribe to your album.
7. Click Announce Photocast to spread the word via an e-mail like the
one shown in Figure 15-11.
The message tells your would-be subscribers how to proceed. An icon
like the one shown here in the source list reminds you that your album is
being photocast.
You can pull the plug on your photocast by returning to the Share menu,
clicking Photocast and choosing Stop Publishing. This action removes the
photos from your .Mac account but not from the iPhoto library.

258
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

If you can’t recall how many albums you’re publishing, visit the photocast
section of iPhoto Preferences to consult the list.
Subscribers need not have iPhoto 6, or even a Mac, to admire your photo-
casts. However, they must have an RSS reader and must enter the URL you
shared with them in your e-mail. Subscribers can drag photocast pictures
into their own albums, books, calendars, and cards, but they can’t erase or
edit your pictures.
.Mac members can publish to iDisk a slideshow that others can view over the
Internet. Choose Share➪.Mac Slides and click the Publish button in the dialog
box that appears. Then click Announce Slideshow to send an e-mail instruct-
ing folks on how to view the show.
Under the Share menu, you can also export a slideshow to iDVD, an applica-
tion you get to know better in Chapter 16.
iPhoto Meet iWeb
As you know, the iLife applications are meant to work together. iPhoto gets
along quite nicely with the newest member of the iLife suite, iWeb, Apple’s
clever Web page and blog creator.
iWeb is built around predesigned templates and placeholders for, among
other things — you guessed it! — pictures. You can export photos from
iPhoto to iWeb and then drag those pictures on top of placeholders, to
replace images that had been warming up the spot. Just follow these steps:
1. Select the photos you want to export.
2. Choose Share➪Send to iWeb, and click either Photo Page or Blog.
iWeb opens (if it was not open already). You can also click the iWeb
button in the iPhoto toolbar.
Apple recommends sending 3 pictures max to a blog. You can add up to
99 pictures to a Web site.
3. Inside iWeb, choose the template to which you want to add pictures
and drag them onto the placeholder.
If you choose a blog, iWeb creates a new blog entry for each picture. Type
text explaining what the picture is all about.
Eventually you’ll publish the whole shebang on .Mac — if you’re a member, of
course.

Preserving Your Digital Shoebox
I’ve already warned you I’m going to take every chance I get to ensure 
that you back up precious files. And what’s more precious than keepsake
photographs?
iPhoto makes it simple to burn CDs and DVDs. Per usual, select the photos
you want to copy (individual pix, albums, or your entire library). Choose
Share➪Burn and insert a disc into your CD or DVD burner. Depending on the
size of your collection and whether you have a CD or DVD burner, you may
be able to archive your entire collection onto a single disc.
If you burn pictures inside iPhoto, they can be viewed later only in iPhoto. To
create a disc that can be viewed also on a Windows machine or elsewhere,
choose File➪Export and then choose a file format such as JPG. Next, choose
a location inside Finder. Quit iPhoto and open Finder. Make sure you have a
CD or DVD in your burner and drag the folder with the photos you exported
onto the disc icon. After the files have been copied, choose File➪Burn Disk
and then click Burn.
Whether you burn CDs or DVDs, you’ll thank me if you ever have to retrieve
photos from these discs. Losing a lifetime of memories is just the kind of dis-
ruption everyone seeks to avoid.

H
ooray for Hollywood. Hooray for iLife. Apple’s digital media suite,
specifically through iMovie HD, provides the video editing and other
software tools you need to satisfy your auteur ambitions. Then when the
movie is in the can, you can find an audience with help from iDVD.
“I’d like to thank all the people who made this award possible. The wonderful cast
and crew, my loving family, my agent. And a special thanks to Steve Jobs . . .”
Of course, even if your filmmaking aspirations are of a more modest nature —
producing slick highlights of Johnny or Gillian’s soccer games, rather than
anything with genuine box office appeal — iMovie and iDVD are still a direc-
tor and producer’s best companions.
In this chapter, I’m working with version 6 of both iMovie and iDVD, available
with the rest of the iLife ’06 upgrade for $79.
Okay, then, let’s get on with it. Places everyone. Ready? Action!

Part IV: Getting an iLife 
Shooting Your Oscar Winner
Legendary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock is said to have asked, “What is drama
but life with the dull bits cut out?” So before sitting in front of the Mac, you
have to go out and capture some of that life on video. Trimming the dull stuff
and converting your raw footage into worthy home cinema comes later.
Alas, I can’t train you to become Hitchcock or Orson Welles or Steven
Spielberg. Heck, if I could do that I’d be sipping martinis in Cannes right
about now (or at least authoring Filmmaking For Dummies.) But I do know
enough to send you off to Oz with the right gear. And that gear pretty much
consists of a digital camcorder.
Using a digital camcorder
Sony is credited with producing the first camcorder, the 1983 Betamovie. It
used a Betamax cassette. Through the ensuing decades, camcorders handled
a variety of media: VHS tapes, VHS-C, 8 millimeter, Hi-8. These analog cam-
corders more than served their purpose for years. But as in almost every
other corner of technology, camcorders too have gone digital. And why not?
Video shot with a digital camcorder doesn’t deteriorate when it’s copied.
Pristine sound is also preserved.
Tape, hard drive, and DVD camcorders
Not all digital camcorders sold today are sim-
patico with iMovie. Popular MiniDV camcorders
make nice with Apple. These compact models,
from such leading manufacturers as Sony, JVC,
Panasonic, Canon, and Samsung, start at less
than $300 and can fetch well into the four digits;
prices for the MiniDV cassettes that you record
on have dipped below $3.
Sony is the only maker of Digital8 camcorders,
whose main benefits are low prices and the
ability to handle analog 8mm and Hi-8 tapes.
Consider this camera if you have a sizable
library of analog media. But there are few
Digital8 models to choose from, and the cam-
eras are bulkier than their MiniDV compadres.
If you intend to edit in iMovie, steer clear of
another Sony camcorder type, Micro MV. The
cameras and tapes are appealingly small, but
they are pricey and aren’t compatible with
iMovie. Two other types of digital camcorders
are also not well-suited for iMovie. These are
camcorders that capture video directly onto
miniature DVDs and hard drive models such as
the expensive JVC Everio models.
In scary movie tech-speak, iMovie accepts
imported video in the high-definition formats
HDV 720p and 1080i (a discussion for later), as
well as MPEG-4 and 16:9 cinematic widescreen.
Basic footage is captured in NTSC and PAL, dif-
fering standards used around the world.

iMovie can exploit only video footage in digital form. The good news for con-
sumers is that prices for most digital camcorders have plummeted in recent
years. The most common type of digital camcorder makes use of matchbook-
sized 60-minute MiniDV tapes. But you also have a lot of other choices, as
shown in the “Tape, hard drive, and DVD camcorders” sidebar.
I advise searching online for camcorder options. Apple will be happy to sell
you models at the store on its Web site, at www.apple.com. You can gener-
ally find excellent prices and a wide selection at www.bandhphoto.com. I
also recommend a visit to www.camcorderinfo.com and a sister site for
beginners at www.easycamcorders.com. These terrific resources feature
reviews, ratings, and primers.
When you purchase a camcorder, make sure you also get the proper FireWire
cable (4-pin-to-6 pin variety) to connect to your Mac. Just to confuse you,
FireWire also sometimes goes by the name i-Link or IEEE 1394.
Using an iSight camera
Of absolutely no surprise to anyone, iMovie HD works fine with video cap-
tured by Apple’s own iSight cameras, be it the standalone version or versions
built in to iMacs, MacBook Pros, MacBooks, and late model PowerBooks. You
must have iChat AV to use iSight with iMovie.
iSight and most of the consumer camcorders sold today deliver excellent results.
But they’re not HD (see the sidebar titled “The lowdown on high definition”).

Chapter 16: Shooting an iMovie Screen Test
The lowdown on high definition
You might have guessed that the HD in iMovie
HD stands for high definition, just like on
increasingly popular (and affordable) HDTVs.
Video produced in high definition boasts rich
color and vivid detail: the ripples in a duck pond,
the freckles and pores on a human face, each
blade of grass on the ball field. Everything’s in
widescreen. Sound is equally superb. As this
book was being published, prices for high-defi-
nition consumer camcorders would set you
back at least $1300. Conveniently, they use the
same MiniDV cassettes as standard definition
digital camcorders, though any video you shoot
in high definition, even on that same cassette,
can’t be played back through a standard cam-
corder.

From Here to Eternity: 
Camcorder to iMovie
Whether in high definition or not, you’ve shot scene after scene of amazing
footage (what could be more dramatic than junior’s first steps?). But remem-
ber Hitchcock’s creed about getting rid of the dull bits? iMovie can help you
do just that. First, though, you have to dump what you’ve captured into the
computer.
When you open iMovie for the first time, most likely by clicking its dock icon,
you’re greeted with the window shown in Figure 16-1. Because this is your
starting-off point, click Create a New Project. Later you can choose between
Open an Existing Project or Make a Magic iMovie, a terrific let-the-Mac-do-
most-of-the-work shortcut I’ll get to later in the chapter.
Importing from the camcorder
As you begin your project, these are the steps to follow:
1. Type the name of your project and choose a destination folder on
your hard drive.
Movies is the default folder.
2. Select a video format from the pop up menu.
For now choose DV, the format used with most camcorders.
Figure 16-1:
You oughta

Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Of course, you can also select DV Widescreen, which results in a cine-
matic 16:9 aspect ratio, referring to the ratio of the width to the height of
a picture. (Lots of state-of-the-art TVs can display video in widescreen.)
You can also select iSight, MPEG 4, or high def formats HDV 1080i or
HDV 720p.
3. Click Create.
The iMovie screen that appears resembles a director’s clapper board.
One view of the iMovie program is shown in Figure 16-2.

4. Set the camcorder to VTR or Play or VCR mode, depending on the
model.
5. If you haven’t already done so, connect the camcorder to the Mac
with a FireWire cable. Make sure the camera is turned on.
6. Back in iMovie, set the import/edit switch, which is below the monitor
window, to the capture position.
Click so that the switch is to the left by the movie camera icon rather
than on the right next to the scissors icon.
7. If you have a machine with iSight, or have more than one camcorder
connected, choose the camcorder you are using for the project at
hand from the camera mode pop-up menu list.
You can now control your camcorder through the Mac by clicking
iMovie’s play, pause, stop, rewind, and fast-forward buttons.
8. Use iMovie to rewind the tape to just before the footage you want to
grab.
9. Click the Play button.
10. When you arrive at the precise section of the tape where you want to
start capturing, press the spacebar or click the Import button in the
iMovie monitor.
You can watch the video in the monitor area. At the same time, iMovie
detects scene breaks and splits them off into clips. These land in the
Clips pane to the right of the monitor.
11. When you have all the footage you want, click Import or press the
spacebar again.
12. Disconnect the camcorder.
If you prefer, arrange to place clips directly on the movie timeline, whose
advantages are discussed later in this chapter. Choose iMovie HD➪
Preferences, click the Import tab, and make sure Movie Timeline is selected
rather than Clips Pane.
Inside iMovie Preferences, you can also check whether you want to start a
new clip at each scene break (the default) and whether you want to set desig-
nated time limits for your scenes.
266
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Importing videos from other destinations
You may have video you want to use in your final blockbuster that’s already
on your hard drive. Or perhaps you want to incorporate video that’s on a CD
or DVD. Choose File➪Import and browse for the videos (or still photos and
audio for that matter) that you want to include.
All is not lost if you have an MPEG 4 camcorder with a USB connector instead
of FireWire. Connect the camera through USB; the camera will appear as a
hard disk icon on your desktop. Open the icon and drag the video onto your
desktop or right into iMovie.
iMovie doesn’t automatically break these videos into clips. Nor can you use
the program’s capture controls to import video or control the USB-connected
camcorder.
This may be about the time you say a little prayer of thanks that you
splurged for an extra-roomy (or additional) hard drive. Video consumes
about 13 gigabytes for every hour of footage (and I’m not even talking high
definition). After you finish your movie and put in on a DVD to share with
family and friends, discard the unneeded footage so you’ll have plenty of
space for the sequel. iMovie is mindful of the available space on your hard
drive; you’ll see an indicator at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
Mastering Post-Production
Your raw footage is in place. In this section, you find out how moviemaking
really gets accomplished: by arranging scenes and adding music, pictures,
titles, transitions, and more. Get ready to unleash your creative juices.
Assembling a movie is where the real joy begins.
Dragging, renaming, and rearranging clips
Adding a clip to your movie is as simple as dragging it from the Clips pane to
the clip viewer or storyboard track. As Quentin Tarantino films prove time
and again, movies do not have to be linear. Feel free to drag clips in any order
and change them at will. Chronology be damned. When you drag a new clip
between two existing scenes in the clip viewer, whichever clips are already
there will step aside to make room.
267
Chapter 16: Shooting an iMovie Screen Test

Because the clips in the Clips pane take on such illuminating names as Clip 03
and Clip 08, you may want to rename them to something a tad more reveal-
ing, such as Alex Scores Goal or Leslie’s Big Monologue. Double-click the clip,
and type that more enlightening name over the old one in the Clip Info
window that appears.
The cutting room floor
It’s isn’t likely or desirable that all the scenes currently in the Clips pane will
make it into your final movie. All smart filmmakers shoot a lot more footage
than they can possibly use. (Gotta have options, my friend.) A good first step
is to watch the clips you’ve assembled by highlighting them in the Clips pane
and clicking Play. The idea here, of course, is to inspect scenes with a critical
director’s eye.
You can watch clips in the monitor or full-screen by clicking the Play Full
Screen button, labeled in Figure 16-2. (I love names that tell you what some-
thing does.) To return to the smaller monitor view after going full-screen,
click anywhere on the screen or press the Esc key.
From the get go, some clips are obvious candidates for the trash: the ones
with blurry close-ups, pictures of your shoes (when you forget to turn off the
camcorder), or grandma hamming it up for the camera. Select the clips you
want to discard, and either press Delete on the keyboard or choose Edit➪Cut.
Such clips are dumped into the iMovie trash can, where they remain until you
empty it. To do that, click the trash can icon at the bottom-right corner of the
application, and then click Empty Trash in the iMovie Trash window that
pops up.
To shed unwanted footage in a scene you otherwise want to keep, try crop-
ping it. Just like cropping a photograph, you are keeping only a specific por-
tion of the video and snipping away at its edges:
1. Select the scene in question.
2. Drag the playhead in the blue scrubber bar below the monitor to the
precise point where you want your scene to commence.
3. Click underneath the playhead, leaving a little crop marker (it looks
like a triangle).
4. Drag the playhead to the right.
As you do so, that section of the scrubber bar turns gold.
5. Now choose Edit➪Crop.
Only the highlighted gold portion of the bar is retained.
268
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

You can drag each crop marker apart to highlight the portion of a scene you
want saved. When you click a crop marker and press either the left or right
arrow keys on the keyboard, the crop marker moves a single frame at a time.
Hold down Shift while pressing either arrow key to make the crop marker
skip ten frames.
To trim just the beginning or end of a clip, drag the crop markers where you
want them and choose Edit➪Clear.
Sometimes you want to split up a single clip to add titles, images, or clips.
Move the playhead to the point where you want to break up the clip and
choose Edit➪Split Video Clip at Playhead.
If after all you’re cropping and trimming you’re not pleased with the results,
you can go back to the original clip as imported from your camera. Control-
click the clip and select Revert Clip to Original.
Adding still pictures to a movie
Interspersing still photos inside your movie is a great way to show off your
artistic prowess. To do so:
1. Click the Media pane button.
2. Click Photos at the top of the Media pane.
You now have your entire iPhoto library at your disposal, as shown in
Figure 16-3.
3. Select the picture you want to add.
4. In the Photo Settings window, drag the sliders to zoom in and out of
the picture and select the duration for your photo to remain on-
screen.
5. If you want to add panning and zooming to a photo as explained in
the previous chapter, select the Ken Burns Effect option.
6. Drag the photo to the clip or timeline viewer to add it to your flick.
To add a slideshow inside your movie, select multiple pictures in Step 3. You
can do so in several ways. Here are two: To select all the pictures, choose
Edit➪Select All; for a range of pictures, hold down the Shift key while you
click the first and last pictures you want to include.
269
Chapter 16: Shooting an iMovie Screen Test

Adding the perfect soundtrack
What would your epic be without an award-winning score? Or a James Earl
Jones or Gene Hackman voiceover (you should be so lucky)? Click the Media
pane button, as in the preceding section. But this time, click Audio at the top
of the pane.
As will immediately become apparent, you have several audio sources to
choose from:
 iTunes: All the music in your iTunes library (Chapter 15) is at hand. If
you have thousands of songs in the library, type the name of an artist or
title you’re looking for in the search box. (Entering Bell, for example,
would bring up works from Joshua Bell or Patti LaBelle or titles such as
Jingle Bells or Wedding Bell Blues.) If a song you want for your movie
isn’t in iTunes yet, pop in a CD to copy it.
Figure 16-3:
An iPhoto
cameo.
270
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

 Your own composition: You can also import music from GarageBand,
the subject of Chapter 18. Suffice to say for now that GarageBand is the
recording studio inside iLife for producing your own hit records.
 Canned sound effects: Apple has compiled dozens of cool audio effects.
Under Skywalker Sound Effects, you can check out and ultimately apply
the sound of Electricity, Film Projector, Heartbeat, Squeaky Door, Ticking
Clock, and many more. Standard Sound Effects include Bubbles, Cartoon
Boing (a personal favorite), Crickets, Footsteps, and Jet Fly By. You’ll
find animal sounds (Cow Moo, Rooster Call), sports sounds (Bowling
Strike, Tennis Serve), and common sounds around the office (Fax
Machine Tones, Telephone Busy Signal).
If you really want people to think you’ve produced something special,
consider adding one of the Clapping or Cheering Crowd effects to the
end of your movie. If you have a low opinion of your work (or a warped
sense of humor), apply the Booing Crowd effect.
 Voiceovers: Since Jones and Hackman were already booked, record your
own narration by clicking the red microphone button. (Your Mac likely
has a built-in microphone, but if it doesn’t you can buy one.) Before pro-
ceeding, move the playhead on the scrubber bar to the spot where you
want to begin.
So what exactly do you do with all this marvelous music and sound? How do
you make sure the soundtrack matches the video rolling on the screen? For
the answers, let’s take a closer look at the timeline viewer.
Time(line) is on your side
The clip viewer, where we’ve mostly been hanging out, is great for rearranging
clip sequences. In the timeline view, though, you get a more detailed look at
the building blocks of your movie. Individual clips or scenes are represented
by horizontal bars of lengths that correspond to their relative duration in the
movie, as you can see in Figure 16-4. You get to the timeline by clicking the
little clock icon on the clips/timeline view switch (labeled in Figure 16-2).
Press Ô+E to quickly toggle between the clips and timeline views.
The timeline is comprised of three tracks; the top is reserved for your video
(and pictures), and the bottom two are for audio. Having more than one
audio track grants you flexibility to play with sound and music. You might
use narration on one track and music in another. You can have sound effects
and music going on simultaneously.
271
Chapter 16: Shooting an iMovie Screen Test

To add music, highlight the song in question, move the playhead to the frame
where you want the soundtrack to kick in, and click Place at Playhead.
Alternatively, drag the song or effect or narration directly onto one of the two
audio timeline tracks (or drag audio from one track to the other). You may
have to slide the entire audio track in either direction so it lines up properly
with the video. Audio tracks are represented by a colored ribbon and (if
Show Audio Waveforms is selected in View) displayed graphically by the
intensity of the sound.
Sound is captured along with video when you import clips into iMovie from a
camcorder. Determining volume levels for your video and audio tracks, so
that one doesn’t drown out the other, can be a challenge.
Following are some of the things you can do with sound:
 Mute an entire track by selecting or unselecting the box to the track’s far
right.
 Adjust levels so that some parts of a track are louder. Choose View➪Show
Clip Volume Levels. A volume level bar stretches across the track. Drag
the bar up or down like a rubber band to raise or lower the volume in that
portion of a scene.
Figure 16-4:
The timeline
view.
272
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

 Adjust the volume level of selected sound effects by dragging the
volume slider near the bottom-left side of the iMovie window.
 As with a video clip, tinker with the length of an audio clip by dragging
its edges. Hold down the Option key as you drag the end of a clip to hear
its sound.
 Drag one clip on top of another in the same audio track to hear both at
the same time. This is a helpful trick if you feel constrained by having
just three iMovie tracks.
 Separate the audio track from a video clip. Select the clip and choose
Advanced➪Extract Audio.
Adding transitions
Clips are arranged as you want them, the soundtrack is in place. Now you just
need a smooth bridge from one scene to the next.
In movie-speak, those bridges are transitions, and iMovie gives you more than
a dozen to choose from, found when you click the Editing pane button and
then click Transitions at the top of the pane.
You may not know the names of all these transitions, but you’ve undoubtedly
seen ones such as Fade Out and Cross Dissolve in movies and television. It’s
kind of a hoot to preview others by clicking their names in the list, even if
you’ll never use them in your movie. In the Push transition, for example, the
new scene entering stage left pushes the existing scene out of the way. As
Figure 16-5 shows, the new scene arriving with the Ripple transition makes an
entrance in a giant transparent bubble, vaguely reminiscent of the Good
Witch Glinda’s appearances in The Wizard of Oz.
When you choose the transition you want, use the speed slider to determine
how long the transition should take. Then just drag the name of the transition
style between the two scenes you want to bridge. iMovie will take several
seconds to render, or process, the transition; a red progress bar lets you
know how long the rendering will take place.
You can’t place certain long transitions between two short scenes. If you try,
a dialog box will clue you in as to how long clips must be to use that particu-
lar transition. Note also that the Fade and Wash effects are the only transi-
tions you can use at the beginning or end of a movie.

Sound off
Howling wind. A grinding camera motor. The
bark of a neighbor’s dog. Not all the sounds
picked up by a camcorder’s microphone are
appropriate to your scene. iMovie can help you
muzzle unwelcome audio. After you’ve selected
the clip you want to hush, click the Editing pane
button and then click Audio FX. Select Noise
Reducer and click Preview. As you watch the
clip in the monitor, drag the slider between Less
and More until you detect sound levels you can
live with. Click Apply to make the change.
While in Audio FX, check out other sound
options. Click Reverb and you can choose
among Room, Club, Cathedral, Atrium, Arena,
and Plate. Select Pitch Changer and you can
drag a slider between Monsters and
Chipmunks. You can also choose Delay,
Highpass, Lowpass, Bandpass, and Graphic EQ,
a master control for bass, midrange, and treble.
You’re not expected to know what any of these
sound like — try ’em out. Go crazy, you Foley
Artist you! (That’s the film crew member who is
often responsible for sound effects.)

To employ the same transition throughout your movie, click Add after you’ve
selected all the clips in your film.
Adding special effects
If you thought transitions were a blast, try applying special effects to individ-
ual scenes or the entire film. Once again, click Editing. Now click Video FX at
the top of the pane.
You can choose an effect that makes it look like your scene was shot in rain
or fog (even if in reality it was a bright sunny day). Effects can turn a color
movie into black and white. Two of my favorites are Aged Film and Glass
Distortion.
If you have the time, check out all the effects. When you click an effect, use
the sliders to determine how quickly to usher an effect in and out. Different
sliders appear for different effects. For example, in the N-Square effect shown
in Figure 16-6, drag the Squares slider to increase or decrease the number of
squares that show up on screen. When an effect is to your liking, click Apply
and wait for iMovie to process your request.

Then feel free to submit your resume to Lucas film’s Industrial Light & Magic.
You’re ready for the big time.
The title track
Every good movie needs a decent title to hook an audience — even if the film
is all about your recent vacation and the only people watching are the ones
who took the trip with you. But c’mon, we’ve gone this far. Don’t quit on me
now. While we’re at it, add closing credits too. You’re the person who put this
darn thing together and you want kudos.
Besides, selecting titles is as easy as everything else you’ve performed in this
chapter:
1. Click the Editing button.
You ought to have this down by now.
2. At the top of the pane, click Titles.
3. Scroll down the list and choose an effect for your title.
As usual, you have lots of possibilities (such as Flying Letters, Scrolling,
Spinning, and Video Terminal). Select one to preview it.
4. Enter the name of your title in the text fields.
Some titles include more fields than others and include + and - buttons
for adding more lines of text. You can also adjust the font, typeface, size,
and color.
5. Use the speed slider to determine how long the title (and your name)
will be in lights — at least figuratively.
6. If you want a black background in your movie when titles are dis-
played, select the Over Black option.
The Over Black option is shown in Figure 16-7. Otherwise the title will
appear on top of your video.
7. Click Add.
276
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Using themes
You may have noticed another pane button called Themes. A theme is a collec-
tion of professionally produced and coordinated motion graphics, titles, over-
lays, transitions, and background effects to add zing to your motion picture.
To take advantage of themes, you’ll need OS X version 10.4.4 or later.
Let’s put these effects into action:
1. Click the Themes button.
2. From the pop-up menu at the top of the pane, click to choose a theme.
Examples are Travel, Road Trip, and Pass Through.
3. Select Theme Elements to display in the iMovie monitor, as shown in
Figure 16-8.

that appears.
These are placeholders for your content. You can drag pictures onto
drop zones also by selecting Media and then clicking Photos.
6. Click Themes.

Making a Magic iMovie
Let me try an analogy on you. Students still learn the basics of arithmetic in
grade school, even though today’s math problems can be solved with any
simple calculator. So now I’m going to tell you that we spent all this time
learning how to produce a movie in iMovie. And yet iMovie can pretty much
do it all for you.

Actually, your crash course in moviemaking does help. Besides, as the head
of your very own Macintosh studio, you still have a few executive decisions
to make.
You have to connect your camcorder with a FireWire cable to import the
footage at the core of your Magic iMovie; USB won’t cut it. Here’s how to pro-
ceed, after your camcorder is connected:
1. Choose File➪Make a Magic iMovie or select the same from the open-
ing iMovie HD window.
The window in Figure 16-9 appears.
2. Fill in a movie title.
See, that’s an important decision.
3. Determine whether to rewind the tape before capturing the movie,
and whether to stop capturing after a designated time.
4. Choose the transitions between scenes or let iMovie randomly choose
on your behalf, by selecting that option from the pop-up menu.
5. Click the Choose Music button and drag songs you want added to the
movie.
6. Decide whether to send the project to iDVD to design and burn your
own DVD.
7. Click Create.
And that is pretty much it. The rest, as they say, is (i)magic.

Chapter 16: Shooting an iMovie Screen Test

Sharing Your Blockbuster
What good would The Godfather be if nobody could watch it? So it goes for
your classic. Take one last look at the movie you’ve produced so far. Watch it
in full-screen on your Mac. If you’re convinced it’s a wrap, it’s time to distrib-
ute it to an audience. Start by visiting the iMovie Share menu, which has the
following options. (Note that each menu option has a Share Selected Clips
Only option. So instead of the full movie, you can send selected clips from the
timeline or clips viewer.)
 Email: Although you can send a movie as an e-mail attachment, this
option is impractical with large files. Consider e-mailing only one- or
two-minute movies. At that, iMovie compresses, or squeezes, the flick to
just 10 frames per second (by contrast, full-motion video is 30 fps) at a
low resolution. Sound will be monaural rather than stereo. You can send
the movie using Mail or another e-mail program on your Mac.
 QuickTime: You’ll be able to play the movie back on other computers
that have QuickTime. Choose compression settings for e-mail, the Web,
Web streaming, CD-ROM, and full quality. Apple lets you know the esti-
mated size of your movie file at the designated compression level. You
can also click Expert Settings to choose your own compression settings.
The less compression, the bigger the file.
 iDVD: You can export the movie to iDVD with chapter markers you
create in iMovie. I have more to say about iDVD in the next section.
 iWeb: Compressing the movie for iWeb brings the movie down to 12 fps,
with medium-quality stereo sound. You can choose whether to share the
movie on the Web or a video podcast.
If you choose a video podcast, your movie is compressed to 30 fps with
better quality stereo. But you have to deal with a much larger file size.
iWeb adds a Subscribe to Podcast button on your main blog page so that
visitors can click to receive new episodes downloaded to iTunes on their
computers. The movie adheres to an industry standard for video known
as H.264. The 44.1 kHz sound conforms to AAC stereo audio. I know, I
know, this is a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo.
 GarageBand: By sending your movie to GarageBand, you can add
another score.
 Bluetooth: Using this short-range wireless technology, you can transfer
your movie from a Bluetooth-equipped Mac to a compatible Bluetooth
device.
 iPod: If you have a video-capable iPod (Chapter 15), you can format the
movie for the iPod, send it to your iTunes library, and use iTunes to
copy the “film.”
280
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

 Video camera: Yes, after all the effort of getting video out of your
camera, you can put it back in. Of course, what you’re delivering is (pre-
sumably) a polished, well-edited movie. Connect the camera to the Mac
through FireWire, insert a blank tape into the camcorder, and switch it to
VTR mode. Add the number of seconds of black you want at the begin-
ning and end of the movie. When the transfer is complete, you can con-
nect the camcorder to a TV and watch.
When iMovie and iDVD Get Together
iDVD is a program for authoring, or designing, a DVD. iDVD is tight with
iMovie (and, for that matter, with iTunes and iPhoto). As with iMovie, you can
exploit Hollywood-style themes and click a Media button to add pictures and
music.
When you’re ready to burn DVDs, you’ll need a Mac with a SuperDrive or at
least a compatible third-party DVD burner. (Apple works with many.) All
recent vintage Macs include CD burners, but not all have DVD burners.
Chapter markers
The movie DVDs you buy or rent at places such as Blockbuster are divided
into chapters so you can quickly find specific scenes throughout a film (and I
use that word loosely because no film is actually involved). The chapters are
accessed through the main DVD menu.
You can add chapter markers to your movie too from inside iMovie. Click the
Chapters pane button, move the playhead to the point where you want to
start a chapter, and then click Add Marker. Type a title for your chapter in the
indicated field. If you change your mind, click Remove Marker.
You can also create chapter markers in iDVD. Visit the Advanced menu in
iDVD and select Create Chapter Markers for Movies.
iMovie automatically adds a chapter to the beginning of your movie. Don’t
add a chapter marker within a transition, or within a second of a transition or
other chapter marker.
When you export a video from iMovie to iDVD, the iDVD program opens. It
recognizes whatever chapter markers you added. If you created a Magic
iMovie and selected the option to send your movie to iDVD, you already have
a completed project inside iDVD ready for the final DVD treatment.
281
Chapter 16: Shooting an iMovie Screen Test

If you’re starting in iDVD from scratch, the dialog box that appears gives you
several options: Create a New Project, Create a Magic DVD, and Open an
Existing Project or OneStep DVD (more on that soon).
If you choose Create a New Project, you need to set the encoding quality that
iDVD will use to prepare the project to be burned. Under the iDVD menu
choose Preferences➪Projects and select either Best Quality (takes longer to
burn) or Best Performance. If you choose Best Performance, you can also
select the Enable Background Encoding option. (The feature is accessible
also in the Advanced menu.) This option lets you continue to work while
iDVD does its thing.
Choosing a theme
Just as you can choose a theme in iMovie, you can do so in iDVD. In this con-
text, a theme is a menu design for your DVD, with differing background
images, buttons style, fonts, music, and animations.
Each new theme includes three coordinated menus — main menu, chapter
selection menu, and slide show menu — that are consistent across the entire
disc. (You an also customize your own theme.)
Click the Themes button and scroll through the list on the right to choose a
theme that meets your requirements, such as the Travel theme displayed in
Figure 16-10. Themes with a circled walking man icon on the bottom-right
have motion. Note that you’re not limited to the default themes; you can pur-
chase third-party themes online.

The newest themes delivered in iDVD 6 can exploit the widescreen 16:9
aspect ratio available on HDTVs (and some analog TVs). These latest themes
also work in the standard (4:3) format. You can also choose themes from
prior versions of iDVD.
As with the themes in iMovie, you can drop content into designated drop
zones. To add a movie to a drop zone, drag it from the Media pane or else-
where on the Mac. If you add a movie with chapter markers, iDVD automati-
cally creates scene selection submenus with a left-pointing arrow that serves
as a Back button.
Menus can hold up to 12 buttons. If you want to go above a dozen, you need
to create submenus to hold them. To do so, click the + (Add button) at the
bottom-left corner of the iDVD screen and choose Add Submenu.
An iDVD slideshow
Want to create a DVD slideshow presentation? Follow these steps:
1. In the main iDVD window, click the + button and select Add
Slideshow.
2. Double-click the My Slideshow button that now appears in the main
iDVD window.
That window is replaced with a drop zone requesting that you Drag
images here.
3. From the Media pane, drag an iPhoto album or individual pictures.
4. From the drop-down lists at the bottom of the screen, choose the dura-
tion your slides will appear and a transition to move smoothly
between slides.
5. Click Settings.
6. Select the options you want to add to the slideshow.
If you want slides to repeat, select Loop Slideshow. If you want to display
navigation arrows, select that option. You can also choose to add image
files to a DVD-ROM, and show titles and comments.
7. To add a soundtrack, choose Audio in the media pane and drag the
song you want onto the audio well, shown in Figure 16-11.
The Slide Duration pop-up changes to Fit To Audio. That way, the slides
and music start and end together. If you prefer, return to a duration of
your choosing.

Altering menus
Although themes come with their own menu screens, you can alter the look
of text on menus by clicking the Menu button, sandwiched between the
Buttons and Themes. You can change the font type, size, and color of the title
(by clicking the color box). You can click Edit Drop Zones to change the back-
ground, audio, and photos. To change things back to their initial state, click
Reset Text.

To make sure your menus and submenus will show up on television, choose
View➪Show TV Safe Area. iDVD will place a red rectangle around the area of
the screen that will be visible on the tube.
Altering buttons
DVD buttons are also meant to fit a particular theme. But if your ideas clash
with Apple’s, you can change the look of buttons by clicking the, um, Buttons
button. Buttons come in different shapes and sizes and customizable colors.
Buttons can be text-only or display video. A movie button is created when
you drag a movie from the Media pane onto the DVD menu screen.
Take a look at the scene selection buttons in Figure 16-12. When you select a
button in the main iDVD window, you can change its shape by clicking one of
the button alternatives in the upper portion of the Buttons pane. Scroll up
and down the list to find button choices you like. The T selection creates a
text-only button.

The DVD jungle
Technologists just can’t help themselves, which
leaves consumers in the lurch. Take the con-
fusing muddle that represents DVD media types.
Although the following disc types work with
iDVD 6, it’s a good idea to double-check the
types of media that your burner can handle. Go
to the System Profiler (found under Applications
inside the Utilities folder) and choose Disc
Burning.
 DVD-R and DVD+R (the latter is pronounced
“DVD plus R”): No do-overs. You can record
these “write-once” discs only one time, so
if you make a mistake, you have to use a
brand new blank disc. On the positive side,
these can play back on most conventional
DVD players. As with all the discs men-
tioned here except the double-layer disc,
these hold about 4.3 gigabytes.
 DVD-RW and DVD+RW: The good news is
these “rewriteable” discs can be recorded
over and over. The bad news is they won’t
play back in all DVD players.
 DVD+R DL: This double layer (write once)
disc can store nearly twice as much stuff 
as the single-layer discs. But older DVD
players can’t handle this type of disc.
Meanwhile, two other incompatible, rival high-
definition disc types have emerged recently:
Blu-ray discs and HD-DVD discs. Macs were
not equipped to handle either nascent format at
the time of this writing, though that may have
changed by the time you read this. Apple is one
of the companies publicly supporting Blu-ray,
but it is also a member of the DVD Forum, the
group backing HD-DVD.

Buttons representing video normally display the first frame in a particular
scene. If you want a different frame as the face of the button, click the actual
button so that a slider appears. Drag the slider until the frame you want
appears. If the button you click has a movie playing in it, uncheck the box
(labeled in Figure 16-12) so that the image will remain static.
Map view editing
Click the Map button at the bottom of the screen (labeled in Figure 16-12) to
switch to iDVD’s Map view, sort of a bird’s-eye view of your project. You can
quickly see how menus and buttons are laid out and connected to one
another, and double-click the chart to jump to a particular scene.

OneStep DVD
Back when you first opened iDVD, you had the opportunity to click OneStep
DVD. To use it, connect your digital camcorder using FireWire, set the cam-
corder to VCR mode, click OK, and insert a blank disc. OneStep DVD automat-
ically rewinds the tape, imports your video, and burns it to a DVD.
Making a Magic iDVD
Just as you can make a Magic iMovie in iMovie, you can make a Magic iDVD in
iDVD. For the latter, choose a theme and drop the movies and photos you
want included onto strips in the main iDVD window, as shown in Figure 16-13.
iDVD takes charge from there, adding a main menu with buttons for your
flick, slideshows, and so on. Drop zones are autofilled with your stuff. You
can edit the Magic iDVD before going on to burn the project to a disc.

Burn Baby Burn
You have reached a truly exciting moment. You are almost ready to burn your
DVD. To make sure everything is perfect, click Preview to see what your DVD
will look like. A little on-screen remote control functions like a regular DVD
remote so you can simulate the post-burning experience.
I also recommend checking out the Project info window. It’s the first selection
under the Project menu and is a wealth of information. You can make sure
you’ve gone with the right aspect ratio (standard or widescreen.) You can see
your encoding choice (best performance, best quality). And you can see the
duration of your project, the number of tracks and menus you’re using (you
get up to 99 each), and so on.
Satisfied? Click the Burn button and insert a blank DVD, though as “The DVD
Jungle” sidebar indicates, which disc to use isn’t always clear cut. The burn-
ing process takes awhile depending on the speed of your burner and the Mac
itself. A progress bar lets you know how the operation is going before the
disc finally pops out. Don’t bother staring at the screen — you probably have
better things to do with your time. Like maybe writing your Oscar acceptance
speech.

o you fancy yourself the rock icon? Your face plastered on the cover of
Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly? Groupies stalking you wherever
you go? Your band’s very own tour bus? “Why Ed, it has nothing to do with
such perks. To me it’s all about the music.” Whatever’s driving you,
GarageBand 3 is iLife’s digital recording studio for making records, creating
podcasts, and scoring movies produced in iMovie.
If you’re inclined to skip this chapter because you can’t distinguish an F-
sharp from a B-flat, take note: You need not read music, play an instrument,
or possess a lick of musical talent to compose a ditty through GarageBand.
Sure, having a good ear helps. And if you can belt out a tune, tickle the ivory,
or jam with the best of them, all the better. Connect a microphone, piano key-
board, or electric guitar to the Mac, and exploit GarageBand to the max.
Forming a GarageBand
When you first launch GarageBand, you can choose to open a New Music
Project, New Podcast Episode, or New Movie Score. For now, we’ll stick with
music. I address podcasts and movie scoring later:
1. Launch GarageBand.
The program is located in the Applications folder. Or click the dock icon
shaped like a guitar.

290
Part IV: Getting an iLife 
2. In the dialog box shown in Figure 17-1, enter a name for your song
and choose a location for the file (GarageBand is the default).
3. Set a tempo, or constant speed, by dragging the slider anywhere
between 40 and 240 beats per minute, or bpm.
4. Choose a Time signature and a scale, or key, from the pop-up lists.
Don’t fret if you don’t know what any of these musical designations
mean. Just stick with the defaults. You’ll learn as you go and can change
them later.
5. Click Create.
The window that opens will look something like Figure 17-2.
Keeping on track(s)
Mastering GarageBand is all about getting comfortable with tracks (discussed
in this section) and loops (see the next section).
Most musical compositions consist of several tracks, or layers of individual
parts recorded by different instruments. You can connect instruments to
your Mac through one of the methods mentioned in the “Connecting real
instruments” sidebar or take advantage of numerous digitally sampled soft-
ware instruments, heard as you play a small on-screen keyboard by clicking its
keys with the mouse. You can choose a wide variety of software instruments,
in all the major instrument families (percussion, brass, and so on).
When you open a new project, GarageBand introduces you to the first of
these software instruments, a grand piano. It appears by default in the tracks
list. It’s the instrument you will hear when you play that miniature keyboard.
Figure 17-1:

To add a new track:
1. Click the Create a new track (+) button at the bottom-left corner of the
program, or choose Track➪New Track.
2. Select Software Instrument or Real Instrument.
3. Click Create.
A new track shows up in tracks list, accompanied in the header by its
icon, name (Grand Piano until you change it), and several tiny controls.
Among other functions, these controls let you mute the track, lock it to
prevent editing changes, make it a solo, and permit or disable a recording.

In the Track Info pane (see Figure 17-3) you can change your instrument
selection from Grand Piano to any other available instrument. To do so,
choose an instrument category from the left column of the Track Info
pane (Guitars in this case) and an actual instrument in the right column
(Classical Acoustic).
You can open the Track Info pane anytime by clicking the little i icon at the
bottom-right corner of the screen. Alternatively, choose Track➪Show Track
Info.
If you selected a real instrument in Step 2, choose an Input (stereo or mono,
channel 1 or channel 2), depending on how the instrument is connected to
the Mac. Select Monitor from the drop-down list to be able to hear the instru-
ment as you play it. If the real instrument you’re choosing is your own voice,
choose Vocals and the instrument that most closely matches your style, such
as Epic Diva, Helium Breath, or Megaphone.
Getting loopy
Don’t let the heading scare you, I’m not advocating alcohol. I’m merely sug-
gesting you might become artistically intoxicated experimenting with
GarageBand loops, the professionally recorded (and royalty-free) musical
snippets at the very foundation of your composition.
Loops supply drum beats, rhythm parts, melody lines, bass sections, and so
on. Apple includes more than 1,000 loop files with GarageBand. You can add
thousands more by purchasing optional $99 Jam Packs (covering Remix
Tools, Rhythm Section, Symphony Orchestra, and World Music).
Click the button that looks like the famous CBS eye logo to open the loop
browser across the bottom portion of the screen. You can view the loop
browser by columns, buttons (as shown in Figure 17-4) or podcast sounds.
Figure 17-3:
Adding

292
Part IV: Getting an iLife 

Search for loops inside the browser by instrument (Bass, Guitars, Strings, and
so on) genre (Rock/Blues, Urban, Country), mood (Relaxed, Intense, Dark), or
combinations of these. Incompatible loop buttons are dimmed. For example,
you wouldn’t be able to find loops that are relaxed and dark.
The list of loop possibilities shows up on the right side of the browser. Click
one of them to check it out, conveniently in the project’s key and tempo.
Most usefully, you can audition loops while the rest of your project is playing
to hear how all the tracks blend. If the loop passes muster, drag it onto the
timeline. Individual tracks and loops make up the rows of the timeline. To add
a new loop, click Reset in the loop browser and make another selection.
The musical patterns in loops repeat (why do you suppose they’re called
loops anyway?). You can also tug on the right edge of a loop to lay down a
track for the entire song. Loops don’t have to start at the beginning of a track;
and if you want to change the mood midstream, you can add a second loop
onto the same track. If you want more than one loop to play in a song (which
is typical), create multiple tracks.
The beat ruler above the timeline serves as a guide; it displays beats and mea-
sures, the latter is how the units of musical time are, um, measured.
If you go by the name, I dunno, Bono or the Boss, you can create loops from
your own performances. Select a Real or Software instrument in the timeline.
Choose Edit➪Add to Loop Library. Then type a name for the loop, choose a
scale and genre (from the pop-up menus), and choose an apt Mood
Descriptor. Click Create when you’re finished.
Building an arrangement
Adding loops or recording your own musical pearls (with real or software
instruments) creates a region in a track. Regions are color coded as follows:
 Purple: Real instrument regions you record
 Blue: Real instrument regions created by loops
 Orange: Real instrument regions from imported audio files
 Green: Software instrument loops from recordings or loops
Figure 17-4:
In the loops.
293
Chapter 17: The Show Must Go On

Regions can be cut, copied and pasted, or resized to play as long as you need
them to. You can also move regions to another track or another area of the
timeline.
Mix it together, maestro
Easy as Apple makes it to lay down tracks and add loops, you won’t become
Quincy Jones overnight. Fact is, even when you match tempos and such,
some music just doesn’t sound good together. I didn’t have much success
blending a Classic Rock Piano with a New Nashville guitar. Mixing or balanc-
ing all the parts so that one track doesn’t drown out another is a challenge in
its own right. You can find various mixer controls and level meters under the
Mixer, labeled in Figure 17-2.
If you make a mistake fiddling with any of the controls you encounter in
GarageBand, just call on that old standby, the Undo command, at the top of
the Edit menu. Or press Ô+Z.
You may want to display your composition with standard notes, clef signs,
and so forth. To do so, select a software instrument region and open the
Track Editor by clicking the button at the lower-left corner of the screen.
Click the notation view button (it has a musical note on it) in the lower-right
corner of the editor’s header area and start composing. Notation view is dis-
played in Figure 17-5.
294
Part IV: Getting an iLife 
Connecting real instruments
If you’d rather not use the on-screen music key-
board to control software instruments, you can
connect a real MIDI keyboard through a USB
cable (on most newer gear) or a MIDI adapter
(on older equipment). MIDI is geek shorthand
for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, a stan-
dard that has been around for years. You can
connect other MIDI instruments, including gui-
tars, woodwinds, and drums, and record onto a
real instrument track in GarageBand. Click the
red record button when you’re ready to rock.
Move the playhead to just before where you
want to start jamming.
If the high-quality instrument you have in mind is
your own singing voice, connect a microphone
(in lieu of the Mac’s built-in microphone) to the
audio input port on the computer. Open System
Preferences, Click Sound, Input, and select Line
In. Drag the Input volume slider to an appropri-
ate level. Good microphones are especially
useful when you’re recording podcasts, as dis-
cussed later in the chapter.

Creating Podcasts
Podcasts are like your own Internet radio or TV show, with music (from
iTunes or elsewhere), pictures, sound effects, video, or some combination of
these. Fans can download your podcasts over the Net (or find them in
iTunes) and subscribe to receive them on a regular basis. Podcasting was
introduced with GarageBand 3, so don’t try the steps in this section with an
earlier version of the program.
Here’s how to put a polished podcast together.
1. From the opening GarageBand 3 screen, click New Podcast Episode.
2. Type a name for your podcast.
The main screen looks like Figure 17-6. It’s a little different from the
GarageBand screen you were using for music. At the top of the tracks list
you’ll notice a special Podcast Track to drag photos or other artwork
from your iPhoto library, accessible through the GarageBand media
browser. Next are tracks to optimize for a male or female voice, plus
Jingles and Radio Sounds.
3. If you haven’t already done so, plug in your microphone.
4. Choose an audio track (Male or Female) and click the red record
button. Start gabbing in your finest radio voice.
You can apply editing tweaks later.
5. To add a radio-style jingle to your podcast, open the loop browser
(again by clicking the button that looks like an eye) and select Jingles.
Choose one that seems appropriate for your podcast and drag it onto
the timeline.
More than a hundred jingles are included. If you’re delivering news com-
mentary, for example, one of the Broadcast News jingles (Long, Medium
or Short) might fit the bill.
6. To add extra audio effects, choose Sound Effects from the loop
browser.
As with any other loop, drag Sound Effects onto the timeline.
Figure 17-5:
Follow the
score in
Notation
view.
295
Chapter 17: The Show Must Go On

You can open a sound effects instrument to add sound effects while you
record your own voice. Choose Window➪Musical Typing. When you
press the key on your keyboard corresponding to the key in the radio
sounds instrument, shown in Figure 17-7, you add that sound to your
podcast. Make sure the red enable recording button is highlighted on
your audio track and Radio Sounds track.
7. To add artwork to your podcast, drag pictures from the Media
browser onto the podcast track.
A chapter marker is added for each picture in a window near the bottom
center of GarageBand.
Figure 17-6:

Part IV: Getting an iLife 
Your very own talk show
A podcast doesn’t have to be just about you. You
can host a talk show. Start an audio or video
chat through iChat, and click the Record button.
You’ll be asked whether you want to record the
conference. Click OK. GarageBand creates a
real instrument track for each person in your
audio or video gab fest. If it’s a video chat,
GarageBand adds a new region to the podcast
track each time that person starts to speak and
grabs a still image from the iSight camera. That
mug is displayed as artwork.

Folks who listen to your podcast on iTunes or photo-capable iPods can see
the images. You can add URLs to those pictures. To add a visual title to your
podcast, drag the artwork to the Episode drop zone in the bottom-left corner
of the GarageBand program.
Ducking
At times you want to decrease the volume of your background tracks so you can
hear spoken dialogue. The answer is a, um, quack-pot solution called ducking.
(Sorry. Couldn’t help myself. Feel free to call the pun police on me — again.)
Choose Control➪Ducking. In each track’s header, an arrow control appears.
Select the up arrow to make a track a lead track and the down arrow to make
it a backing track. When ducking is on, the sound on backing tracks is low-
ered whenever sound is detected on a lead track. You can adjust the amount
of ducking by displaying Track Info. Choose Track➪Show Track Info, click
Details, and drag the Ducking Amount slider.

Sharing your podcast
When you’re ready to share your podcast, you have a few options, each
appropriately found under the Share menu. Click Send Podcast to iTunes to
do just that. Or click Send Podcast to iWeb to do that. In iWeb, the podcast
automatically becomes a blog entry.
From iWeb, you can publish your podcast to .Mac. Then visitors who click
the Subscribe to Podcast button can receive any new episodes.
You can also submit your podcast to the iTunes Music Store. Your podcast is
available free to your awaiting public:
1. Click Inspector in the iWeb toolbar (it’s to the bottom right of the
screen), and then click the RSS button to open the Blog & Podcast
button, shown in Figure 17-8.

2. Add the Series Artist name and Contact Email.
Your e-mail address will not show up in iTunes.
3. In the Parental Advisory pop-up, indicate whether your podcast is
Clean or Explicit.
4. Select the Allow Podcast in iTunes Music Store option.
5. Choose File➪Submit Podcast to iTunes.
6. Enter copyright information, a category for your blog, the language,
and again indicate whether it is Clean or Explicit.
7. Click Publish and Submit.
You are responsible for owning or getting permission for any copyrighted
material associated with your podcast. Apple maintains the right to pull the
plug.
Scoring an iMovie
Most memorable motion pictures also have great soundtracks. GarageBand 3
makes it a relative breeze to score the epic you created in iMovie. From
iMovie, choose Share➪GarageBand. This opens GarageBand and sends your
movie there. The GarageBand media browser appears on the right side of the
screen, with thumbnails of your iMovie projects.
If you double-click the thumbnail of the movie you have in mind, it plays
inside the media browser. To start scoring the flick, drag it onto a video track.
In a few seconds after a conversion takes place, the video track is laid out
with individual scenes in the timeline. A real instrument track called video
sound is added automatically, as shown in Figure 17-9.
When you click Play, the movie plays in the video preview window to the
right of the timeline. Everything is synchronized with the music timeline, so
you can add new loops, instruments, effects, and so forth, and arrange and
mix them as with any GarageBand project. Move the slider at the bottom left
to see more of the movie on the timeline.
299
Chapter 17: The Show Must Go On

When the video track is highlighted and you click Track Editor, you can add
markers to the movie. Just move the playhead along the timeline to the cor-
rect spot and click Add Marker. Type a chapter title and URL if desired. If so,
select the Displays URL option. Chapters are useful if you intend to burn a
movie onto a DVD. If that is indeed your poison, choose Share➪Send Movie
to iDVD and let your DVD burner take over from there.
Remember, the show must go on.

ooner or later I was going to run the technical mumbo-

you might think.
So read on about the virtues of wired and wireless 
networking. Find out how to turn your Mac into a, gosh,
Windows PC. Figure out what to do when your Mac
behaves irrationally. Within limits, you too can become 
a Mac fixit man or woman.

Networking Madness

 Brushing up on Bluetooth
I
n some ways a treasured Mac is like a baby. The machine is loved, pam-
pered, even spoiled. But the reality for most of us is that our chosen com-
puter is but one among many. It may very well have siblings, um, other
computers in the house. Or your Mac may reside in a company or dormitory,
where it almost certainly has to get along with other computers. If you’ve
bitten into one Apple, you’ve perhaps bitten into others. For that matter,
chances are quite good that the Mac must share quarters with a Windows
machine. It’s such a brave new world that your Mac may even sit next to a
computer that runs the operating system known as Linux.
In the ideal computing environment, the various machines can share files,
data, music, printers, an Internet connection, and other resources. That’s
what networking, or the practice of connecting multiple computers, is all
about. Although networking topics are as geeky as any you’ll come across,
Apple, in customary fashion, simplifies it as much as possible.
Read on for a basic introduction to computer networking.
Networking Done Right
There’s no right or wrong way to network computers. In this day and age, you
can set up a wired or wireless network or, more than likely, a combination of
the two.
Two or more interconnected machines in the same proximity form what
geeks commonly refer to as a local-area network, LAN for short. Contrast that
with a wide-area network, or WAN.

304
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 
I’ll start with the traditional tethered approach to cobbling a network together.
You’ll be that much happier when you’re liberated from wires later on.
The wired way
If the Macs you intend to network are almost always going to stay put in one
location, the wired approach is arguably the best way to proceed. Wired net-
works are zippier, more secure, typically less expensive (notwithstanding the
cost of lengthy cables), and perhaps the easiest to set up (though you may
get an argument there, too), unless dealing with a mess of wires becomes,
well, a real mess.
In Chapter 2, I introduce you to Ethernet, the data cable whose end looks
likes an oversized phone plug. Such cables also go by the names Cat 5,
10BaseT, or 100BaseT. What’s more, not all Ethernet cables are created equal,
as the “Crossing over” sidebar explains.
Up for more geek terminology? The connector at the end of an Ethernet cable
is called RJ-45, not to be confused with RJ-11, the connectors that are put to
use in telephones. RJ stands for Registered Jack, which is probably only
useful if asked in a game of Trivial Pursuit.
To get started with a wired network, plug one end of the cable into the Ethernet
port included in all modern Macs. The other end typically goes into an inexpen-
sive network hub, switch, or router, which in turn is connected to the box feed-
ing your Internet connection, usually a broadband cable modem or DSL.
Although there are technical distinctions between hubs, switches, and routers
(and routers usually contain built-in hubs), I’ll use the terms interchangeably
here. In any case, routers contain multiple jacks, or ports, for connecting each
Mac (or other computer) or printer that becomes part of your network.
Crossing over
You can directly connect one Mac to another
sans hub using a special kind of Ethernet cable
called a crossover cable. This cable is a dead
ringer for a standard Ethernet cable, so be sure
and ask which one you’re getting at the store
and label it when you get home. Such a cable is
required to directly connect older Macs but isn’t
necessary when connecting newer machines,
which can automatically detect when a
crossover cable is used. For a list of Apple prod-
ucts that do or do not require the use of a
crossover cable, consult http://docs.
info.apple.com/article.html?art
num=42717.

Cutting the cord
Certain benefits of technology are so obvious they practically explain them-
selves. Wireless is one of those liberating technologies. By eliminating cables,
you can
 Wander around with a laptop and still hold on to a connection.
 Drastically reduce the tangle of cables and cords, so that the area
behind your desk won’t be nearly as untidy.
 Easily add on to the network later, without worrying about connecting
cables.
 Access other wireless networks outside your home or office, through
public or private hotspots (found in numerous coffeehouses, airports,
libraries, parks, and elsewhere). Accessing these hotspots may or may
not be free.
Landing safely at the AirPort
All the Macs introduced during the last few years are capable of exploiting
wireless networking through radio technology that Apple brands AirPort.
Most of the rest of the computing world refers to the core technology as Wi-
Fi, as outlined in the “ABCs of Wi-Fi” sidebar.
If your Mac doesn’t have built-in wireless but does have OS X version 10.27 or
later, you can install an optional $79 AirPort Extreme card. Also note that
AirPort Extreme is not compatible with Power Mac G5 Dual and Power Mac
G5 Quad computers introduced in October 2005.
Macs with built-in wireless communicate over the air — even through walls and
at times considerable distances — with a compatible router or base station.
As of this writing, Apple sells two versions of the AirPort base station, the
$199 AirPort Extreme, shown in Figure 18-1 and described in this section, and
the portable $129 AirPort Express addressed later.

Apple grounded the first-generation AirPort base station model and cards,
though you can still find them on eBay. The cards may be your only hope if
you hope to go wireless on an older Mac.
Although Apple would love to sell you an AirPort base station, wireless-capable
Macs can tap into routers produced by the likes of Belkin, D-Link, Linksys, and
Netgear, even if you previously set those up to work with a Windows network.
Windows machines can also take advantage of an AirPort base station.
Under ideal, and frankly rarely met, conditions, AirPort Extreme provides
maximum ranges of 50 feet at around 54 Mbps (which is plenty fast) and 150
feet at 11 Mbps (still plenty fast enough for Web surfing). The range and
speed of a wireless network is affected by all sorts of factors, including inter-
ference from other devices, concrete, and metal walls.
A combination of up to 50 Macs or Windows PCs can simultaneously share a
single AirPort Extreme base station.
To set up AirPort Extreme:
1. Plug the AirPort Extreme to a power outlet.
See not all cords are eliminated in a wireless scenario. There’s no power
switch; status lights are your only immediate clue that your AirPort has
taken off.

2. If you’re using a cable modem or DSL, connect an Ethernet cable to
the LAN port on the base station. With a wired Ethernet network, con-
nect to the WAN port.
You can also connect a regular phone line to the modem port.
3. Run the AirPort Setup Assistant software, found in the Utilities folder
inside the Applications folder.
4. For advanced security and other settings, run the AirPort Admin
Utility software, also found in the Utilities folder.
You can determine the signal strength of your wireless connection by examin-
ing the radiating lines icon in the menu bar pictured here.
Boarding the AirPort Express
It looks kind of like a power adaptor that might come with an Apple laptop,
right down to its built-in plug (see Figure 18-2). But the rectangular near 7-
ounce AirPort Express device is a versatile little gadget. This portable hub
has just three ports on its underbelly: Ethernet, USB, and line-out.

Chapter 18: Networking Madness
ABCs of Wi-Fi
The underlying technology behind AirPort is
called Wi-Fi, the friendlier moniker applied to
the geekier 802.11 designations. “Eight-oh-two-
dot-eleven” (as it’s pronounced) is followed by
a letter, typically b or g. These letters indicate
the speed and range you can expect from your
wireless configuration. Alas, the geek alphabet
makes little sense. Indeed, a few years ago,
products that met a wireless standard called
802.11a hit the market after those based on
802.11b. And here you thought you had learned
your ABCs by kindergarten?
AirPort Extreme measures up to the modern
802.11g standard, nearly five times faster than
the b standard that the original AirPort met
when it debuted in 1999. As this book was being
published, products based on an even faster
standard, 802.11n, were emerging, though none
had been introduced yet by Apple. (That may
well have changed by the time you are reading
this.) In any case, the newer standard is back-
wards compatible, meaning products based on
it will work with older gear, though not to its
fullest potential.
Keep in mind that when it comes to Internet
downloading and uploading speeds, the limiting
factor is your Internet provider, not the maxi-
mum networking speeds that your Wi-Fi gear is
capable of. Faster networking speeds refer to
how swiftly files are delivered from one com-
puter to another device on the network, which is
important if you want to transfer, or stream, siz-
able video files. But you won’t surf the Net any
faster than the signal coming in from your ISP.

Courtesy of Apple
If you plan on using AirPort Express as a router, plug the device into an AC
outlet and connect an Ethernet cord to your cable modem or DSL. You’ll use
the same AirPort software as the Extreme base station.
There’s no on-off button; status lights clue you in on how things are going. A
steady green status light tells you that you’ve connected with no problem.
Flashing amber means the device is having trouble making a connection, and
you may have to resort to other means, including (as final resort) taking the end
of a straightened paperclip and holding down a “reset” button for 10 seconds.
Here’s what AirPort Express can accomplish:
 Connect it to your cable modem or DSL and use it as a wireless 802.11g
router, just like its larger sibling.
 Use it as a wireless bridge to extend the range of an existing AirPort net-
work beyond 150 feet.
The process, known as creating a WDS for Wireless Distribution System,
has a potential downside: It could impair the performance of your exist-
ing network. Open the AirPort Setup Assistant software and following
the on-screen instructions.

 Connect a printer to the AirPort Express USB port to share that printer
with any computer on the network.
 Connect a cable from the broadband box in a hotel room, and you can
roam around the room and surf wirelessly.
AirTunes
One more clever feature is available, and it involves the aforementioned line-
out port. If you connect AirPort Express to your home stereo receiver or
powered speakers, you can pump the music from your Mac (or Windows)
iTunes library through your stereo system. You can use either a mini-stereo
to RCA-type cable, or what’s called a mini-digital, fiber-optic Toslink cable, if
your stereo can accommodate that kind of connector.
Either way, iTunes detects the remote connection. Through a small pop-up
menu, you can click Computer to listen to music through your Mac (or what-
ever speakers it is connected to) or you can listen through Express and
whichever speakers or stereo it is hooked up to. Apple refers to this wireless
symphony as AirTunes.
Apple will sell you these optional (Monster brand) cables for $39. For about
$60, Apple will also sell you a Keyspan Express remote control. Absent such a
remote, you’d have to race to the Mac with iTunes to determine which songs
will play through the stereo. The Keyspan remote control’s “receiver” con-
nects to the USB port on the AirPort Express device.
Testing your network
With all your equipment in place it’s time to make sure everything works as it
should. Fortunately, testing your network is as easy as opening Safari and
seeing if you can browse.
If you run into problems, click the signal strength icon in the menu bar and
make sure an AirPort network or other router is in range.
If you’re still having trouble, open System Preferences under the Ú menu and
choose Network. Click the Assist Me button, and then click Diagnostics in the
dialog box that appears. You can check the status of AirPort and Network
Settings, your ISP, and so on.
309
Chapter 18: Networking Madness

If you live in an apartment building or are right on top of your neighbors,
their routers may show up on your Mac’s list. In some instances, the signal
will be strong enough so that you may piggyback on their setup, not that I’m
advocating doing so. Let this be a lesson that they should have implemented
their security settings (requiring robust passwords) and that in setting up
your own Wi-Fi network, you should do the same.
Let’s Share
Responsible parents teach kids how to share toys. When the youngsters grow
up and their toy of choice is a Macintosh, they may still be in that sharing
frame of mind.
Anyway, with your networking gear in place, do the following:
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences:
2. In the Internet & Network section, click Sharing.
The pane shown in Figure 18-3 opens. You may want to change your
computer name at this point. Calling it Edward Baig’s Computer, as I do,
makes it sound like “it’s my computer and you can’t play with it.”
Naming it say Basement iMac would help you distinguish the computer
from, say, Bedroom MacBook Pro.
Figure 18-3:
It’s polite to

310
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

3. Click the Start button, under Personal File Sharing Off.
After several seconds, users of other machines can access any Public
folders on the Mac. If you change your mind about sharing — you may
feel uncomfortable that anyone on the Net can read those publicly avail-
able files — click the button that now says Stop.
Other Mac users can access your machine by choosing Go➪Network in the
Finder.
If you select the Windows Sharing option, you can let Windows users in on
the fun too. You’ll have to take the additional step of entering the password
of each account you may want to share.
Brushing Up on Bluetooth
Of all the peculiar terms you come across in the tech world, Bluetooth is
probably my favorite. The name is derived from tenth-century Danish
monarch, Harald Blåtand, evidentially the wireless networking champ of his
time. Blåtand was considered a peacemaker in warring Scandinavia, and isn’t
networking after all about bringing people — or things — together? In any
case, Blåtand apparently translates to Bluetooth in English.
Fascinating history, Ed, but I thought I bought Macs For Dummies not European
History For Dummies. What gives?
Fair point. Here’s the drill: Bluetooth (the technology, not the Viking king) is a
short-range wireless scheme that lets your Mac make nice with a gaggle of
compatible gadgets, from up to 30 feet away.
Among the tricks made possible with Bluetooth:
 Connect the Mac to a Bluetooth cell phone at a distance of 30 feet. If you
don’t have access to a Wi-Fi hotspot, you may be able to use the phone
as a modem to connect wirelessly to cyberspace.
 Wirelessly print through a Bluetooth printer.
 Exchange files with another Bluetooth-ready Mac or other computer or
gadget.
 Schmooze via iChat through a Bluetooth headphone.
 Synchronize data with a Palm-based handheld device.
 Control a wireless Bluetooth keyboard or mouse.
Some newer Macs come equipped with Bluetooth capabilities. Companies
such as Belkin and D-Link sell Bluetooth adapters in the $35 to $40 ballpark.
311
Chapter 18: Networking Madness

Getting discovered
The path to a meaningful Bluetooth experience starts in System Preferences.
Click Bluetooth under the Hardware section, and you’re taken to the area
shown in Figure 18-4.
Before the Mac can communicate with a Bluetooth device, or in turn that
device with your Mac, the machine’s Bluetooth feature must be powered on.
To help other devices find your Mac, select the Discoverable option.
Similarly, you’ll want your other Bluetooth devices to be placed in a
Discoverable mode so that your Mac can communicate with them. But be
wary. If you’re out in public, you may want to turn off Discoverable mode for
security or privacy reasons.
You can control how the various devices share files with your Mac. Click the
Sharing tab in Bluetooth Preferences and turn Bluetooth File Transfer On or
Off as desired. Inside this important area, you can also choose to permit
Bluetooth File Transfer, Bluetooth File Exchange, and Bluetooth-PDA-Sync.
You can also determine the Public or other folders that Bluetooth devices are
permitted to browse on your computer. As one other key measure of security,
select the Require Pairing for Security option (described next), which means
a password will be required before files can be transferred.

Pairing off
To pair, or set up, Bluetooth devices to work with your Mac, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Bluetooth in System Preferences.
2. Select the Devices tab and click Set Up New Device.
Alternatively, if the Bluetooth status icon appears in Tiger’s menu bar,
click the icon and click Set up Bluetooth Device. Either way, the
Bluetooth Setup Assistant appears.
3. Select the types of devices you want to set up, such as a mobile phone.
Choose Any Device if the device you have in mind is not on the list.
Make sure the given device is within 30 feet of the computer.
4. Make sure Bluetooth is turned on in the selected device.
If Bluetooth is not turned on, you may have to dig through the device’s
menus to find the control that wakes up Bluetooth.
With any luck, the Mac should find it. As shown in Figure 18-5, my
Bluetooth setup found a Palm device.
5. Click Continue.
The Mac will spend a few seconds gathering whatever intelligence it can
about the chosen device to determine how to interact with it.

Chapter 18: Networking Madness

6. Click Continue again.
The device will ask you to enter a passkey.
7. Enter the passkey.
The pairing process is complete, and the gizmo and the Mac can share a
Bluetooth connection.
You may want to take a few more steps and click Devices under Bluetooth
Preferences. From there, highlight the device in question and then click the
Configure button to set up any other supported Bluetooth services on the
device.
To send files wirelessly from the Mac to the device in the future, click the
Bluetooth menu icon and choose Send File. Then select the file you have in
mind from the Finder window. Click Send. Remember to turn on Bluetooth in
the other device.
By now you should be pleased your baby is playing so well with others.

I
f it weren’t for the fact that their darling computers are so darn special,
you might expect loyal Macintosh users to have an inferiority complex.
But there’s absolutely nothing inferior about the Mac operating system, save
its teeny-tiny market share.
Apple has had only modest success through the years getting Windows users
to switch to the Mac camp. However, the runaway success of the iPod and
the move to Intel processors may help Apple lure more Windows defectors. (I
sure don’t know many people who actively choose to go from Mac to
Windows, unless business requirements dictate otherwise.)
That said, this is, for better or worse, a Windows dominated world. More
times than not, the Apple user has to adapt to the Windows environment
rather than the other way around. From time to time, the Mac user encoun-
ters programs and Web sites that get along only with the Windows platform.
The Apple-Intel pairing demonstrates, however, that this is a topsy-turvy
world. Intel and Microsoft have been a couple for so long it still seems
unlikely that Intel would seek alliances elsewhere, especially with Apple.
What’s more, as we’ll see in this chapter, you can actually transform the
newest Macs into fully functioning Windows computers. That bears repeat-
ing: You can actually transform the newest Macs into fully functioning Windows
computers.

316
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 
What Mac and Windows Have 
in Common
For all their differences, Mac and Windows are more alike than you may ini-
tially grasp. Sometimes, it’s only a matter of semantics. Okay, it’s more than
that. But this chapter is about harmony, so common ground is as good a
place as any to start:
 Macs and Windows PCs can share the same printers, scanners, digital
cameras, mice, keyboards, and other peripherals.
 Both systems are fluent in the common file types, including PDFs, JPEGs,
and text.
 Microsoft produces a version of Office for both platforms. So you can
work in programs such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with little diffi-
culty. The Mac and Windows versions of Office have used the same files
since Office 97 for Windows came onto the scene.
 The Mac can read Windows PC–formatted CDs and DVDs.
 Both sides can easily communicate by e-mail or the AIM (AOL) instant
messaging service.
 You can access a .Mac account (Chapter 12) — including documents,
pictures, and movies stored in iDisk — from a Windows PC.
 Versions of the Windows Media Player, QuickTime Player, and RealPlayer
work on a Mac.
 As noted in Chapter 18, the two systems can be on the same wired or
wireless network. If file sharing is turned on in Windows, the computers
can share files.
 And as you already know, Intel is now inside both computers.
Making the Switch
Okay, so you’ve read enough of this book to satisfy your curiosity about the
Mac and you’re ready to defect to the Apple side — or at least get a Mac to
play alongside a Windows machine.
But frankly, you’ve invested a lot of time and energy over the years in getting
your Windows files and preferences just as you like them. You have a lengthy
list of Internet Explorer bookmarks and favorite background pictures too.
Within certain limits, this section describes ways to replicate your Windows
environment on a new Mac.

Move2Mac Software
The $50 Move2Mac program from Detto Technologies does most of the heavy
lifting of moving to a Mac from Windows. You create a profile of settings and
files that you want to move over from the PC, and let the software take over
from there.
Move2Mac combines software you load on both your Mac and PC with a spe-
cial cable to connect the two. For pre-Windows XP systems, get the version of
Move2Mac with a Mac-USB-to-PC-parallel cable. For an XP machine, get a
USB-to-USB cable.
The software is smart enough to put files in the right place. So My Music files
in Windows go into the Music folder on the Mac, My Pictures into the
Pictures folder, and My Videos into the Movies folder.
Move2Mac can’t do everything. Applications are not ported over from the PC,
nor does Detto’s program convert PC files to a Mac format. That’s no big deal
with a program such as Office because the Mac can read files produced in the
Windows version of the program.
When a company produces versions of its software for both platforms —
such as Intuit and its Quicken personal finance software — you have to con-
vert files produced in Windows to the Mac format before you can access your
data.
It takes about 15 minutes to migrate 500MB of data. You can move data off a
single PC (to any number of Macs), unless you pay for extra software
licenses. Check out www.detto.com/move2mac/ for more information.
Help from Apple
When you buy a new Mac at the Apple Store, you qualify to have a certified
Mac technician, not so modestly known as a Genius (see Chapter 19), transfer
all your data for free. If you purchased your Mac online or at another retailer,
a Genius will still transfer your data, for a fee starting at $50.
The PC must be running Windows 95 or later, and you need to bring your
Windows installation disks, any appropriate cables, and the PC keyboard and
mouse. Under this free scenario, you have to configure settings on your own.
317
Chapter 19: Surviving in a Windows World

Burning a disc
Because your Mac can read CDs or DVDs formatted for Windows, you can
burn your important files onto a disk and copy them onto your Apple. You
may not have to burn all your files onto a disc, but a good place to start is in
your My Documents folders (which may include photos and videos) on the
Windows machine.
External hard drives
You can exchange files on external USB or FireWire-based hard drives, USB
“thumb” drives, and Iomega Zip drives.
You can even use an iPod as an external drive by setting it up for disk use.
Temporarily dump songs off the iPod to create more room (then add the music
back later). Visit docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300173
for a detailed explanation.
Using an existing network
Another way to get files from Windows to a Mac is by using a network. Make
sure file sharing is turned on in Windows. I won’t walk you through all the
steps in Windows, but start by double-clicking My Computer, then click
Tools, Folder Options, View and make sure the Use Simple File Sharing option
is selected.
Add your Mac to your wired or wireless network (if it’s not already part of it)
and exchange files as outlined in Chapter 18.
The KVM switch
If you just bought a Mac but are holding on to your Windows computer for
awhile, consider a KVM (keyboard-video-mouse) switch. This device uses
USB to let the two machines share the monitor and various peripherals. A
Belkin KVM switch with all the necessary cables costs around $70.

Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

Enlisting in Boot Camp
In the preceding section I touched on various strategies for allowing separate
Mac and Windows machines to coexist. But if you own one of the newer Intel-
based Macs, you can run OS X and Windows XP on one machine.
It may seem like divine intervention. In fact, it’s been possible to run Windows
on a Mac for some time — with agonizing limitations. Macs loaded with
Microsoft’s Virtual PC emulation software can do Windows, too, but the pro-
gram is painfully slow, can’t work with any of the latest Apples, and is not
compatible with all Windows programs on older Macs.
In the spring of 2006, two clever paths to a WinMac machine emerged. I
address the first, from Apple itself, in this section. I weigh in on another
method from a Northern Virginia startup named Parallels in the next section.
Boot Camp, Apple’s near-finished beta software, shook up the computing
public upon its apocalyptic arrival in early April. After loading the software
onto my iMac, it instantly became the fastest (among the many) Windows
machines in my house.
Although Boot Camp is still in beta as of this writing, Apple announced that it
will be featured in the next major release of OS X (dubbed Leopard), which is
expected early in 2007. In the meantime, you can download a version of the
software at www.apple.com/macosx/bootcamp. It includes Boot Camp
Assistant software, stored in the Utilities folder under Applications.
Boot Camp itself is free, but you have to supply your own single-disc, full-
install version of the Windows XP CD with Service Pack 2 ($199 on up). An XP
upgrade disc won’t cut it.
Other requirements follow:
 An Intel Mac with OS X version 10.4.6 or later — if need be, run Software
Update
 At least 10GB of free space on the startup disk
 A blank recordable CD or DVD
If you don’t run into snags, the entire installation (including Windows) should
take about an hour.
319
Chapter 19: Surviving in a Windows World

But because snags are possible, back up all your important information on
the Mac’s startup disk. Remember too that when you transform your Mac, it
becomes as vulnerable to viruses and spyware as any other Windows PC.
Basic training
Here are the steps you must take to get through Boot Camp:
1. Run Boot Camp Assistant (in the Utilities folder under Applications) to
make sure you have the latest firmware on your computer.
You’ll find any updates at www.apple.com/support/downloads/.
Follow any on-screen instructions if you are updating the firmware.
2. Click Burn a Macintosh CD, and insert a blank recordable CD or DVD.
Boot Camp Assistant guides you through burning a Macintosh Drivers
CD, as shown in Figure 19-1. You need these software drivers later on to
instruct Windows.
3. Create a partition for Windows XP.
You are essentially carving out an area of your hard drive for the XP
operating system. This partition must be at least 5GB and can swell as
large as the total free disk space on hand minus 5GB. If you don’t plan on
Figure 19-1:
Getting
through
Boot Camp
drills.
320
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

doing much in Windows, keep the XP partition small; if you plan on run-
ning graphics-heavy games and a lot of Windows programs, you might
devote a more generous chunk to Windows. Drag the divider to set the
partitions for both OS X and XP.
4. Insert the Windows XP CD. Click Start Installation.
5. When asked to select a Windows partition, select only partition C:.
Failure to do so could wipe out your entire Mac OS X startup disk.
6. Format the partition in either NTFS or FAT.
FAT provides better compatibility between the two operating systems;
NTFS is more reliable and secure.
7. After Windows is installed, use the Mac Drivers CD you created in
Step 2 so that AirPort, Bluetooth, the Eject key on the Mac keyboard,
networking, audio, and graphics are recognized by the XP operating
system.
A Startup Disk control panel for Windows is also added. You have to
eject the Windows XP CD to install the Mac Drivers CD; to eject the CD,
go to My Computer, select drive D:, and click Eject This Disk in the
System Tasks list.
8. When you see the message that the software “has not passed Windows
Logo testing,” click Continue Anyway.
Don’t cancel any driver installers. The computer will restart.
9. Follow any Found New Hardware instructions.
As with any new Windows computer, Microsoft requires that you activate
your XP software with 30 days.
Not everything in Windows may run smoothly (or at all) off the bat. For
instance, many PC manufacturers include DVD decoders that help your
machine recognize and play discs. But a DVD decoder is not included with a
retail copy of XP. You’ll have to separately add a DVD decoder for XP or
merely watch those movies in Tiger.
As of this writing, certain peripherals and features were not supported under
Boot Camp, including built-in iSight cameras, Apple’s Bluetooth wireless key-
board and mouse, the Apple remote, the Apple USB modem, and keyboard
backlighting on the MacBook and MacBook Pro notebooks.
Which raises the question? How do I return to OS X?
321
Chapter 19: Surviving in a Windows World

Switching operating systems
You can go back and forth between Tiger and XP, but you can’t run both
simultaneously under Boot Camp. Instead, you have to boot one operating
system or the other, thus the name Boot Camp.
Here’s how: Restart your machine and press down the Option key until icons
for each operating system appear on the screen. Highlight Windows or
Macintosh HD and click the arrow to launch the operating system you want
for this particular session.
If you want OS X or Windows to boot every time, choose Ú➪System
Preferences and click Startup Disk. Choose the OS you want to launch by
default.
You can perform the same function in XP by choosing Start➪Control Panel,
and then choosing (under Category View) Performance and Maintenance.
Next, click the Startup Disk control panel, and click either the Macintosh HD
or Windows icon, depending on your startup preference.
A Parallels Universe
As we’ve just seen, Boot Camp’s biggest drawback is its requirement that you
reboot your computer every time you want to leave one operating system for
a parallel universe. Can anyone spell hassle?
A remedy is available from a Virginia startup, Parallels, Inc., in the form of a
virtual machine. Parallels Desktop for Mac (around $80) simulates a Windows
machine inside its own screen within OS X. Or, if you feel like it, go full-screen
with Windows. The faux machine behaves just like the real deal. You can add
software, surf the Web, and listen to music (though I had trouble ejecting
disks until I returned to the Mac environment).
You can even apply this virtualization stuff with versions of Windows dating
back to Windows 3.1 as well as Linux, Solaris, OS/2, MS-DOS, and other oper-
ating systems.
Parallels differs from Boot Camp because you can run any OS while you run
Tiger, without having to restart, as shown in Figure 19-2. What’s more, you
can share files and folders between OS X and Windows and cut and paste
between the two.
322
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

There is a downside: Parallels spits out just enough technical jargon to ward
off some users who might otherwise be attracted to such a program.
Fortunately you can get the hang of Parallels quickly and ignore most of the
scary terminology.
Here’s how to fetch the program:
1. Download a trial version at www.parallels.com/en/download.
2. Click Continue in the Downloads window on the Parallels-Desktop
XXXX-Mac.dmg file.
3. Click the Parallels-Desktop.pkg icon.
A Welcome screen appears.
4. Click Continue, and follow the instructions on all the other screens
that appear.
5. Open the installed program from your Applications folder.
6. You’ll have to choose and configure a virtual machine. Go with the
recommended Create a Typical VM when asked how to proceed.
7. Specify the Guest operating system you have in mind.
In our exercise, it’s Windows XP.
Figure 19-2:
Entering a

323
Chapter 19: Surviving in a Windows World

8. Enter a trial or permanent activation key, depending on whether you
buy the program.
9. Install Windows (or the OS of choice), typically by inserting a CD or
DVD into the Mac.
You have to activate your copy of XP.
You may be wondering, how do I control two operating systems with one
mouse and keyboard? Clever of you to ask. Use the CD-player-like controls on
the right edge of the Parallels Desktop window to turn on, stop, or pause
your virtual machine, as shown in Figure 19-3. First turn on your virtual
machine (by clicking the right-facing arrow), then click inside the Guest OS
console, and your mouse belongs to Windows. Press Ctrl+Alt to release the
mouse back into OS X’s custody.
By installing Parallels Tools under the VM menu, you can use the cursor in
Windows without pressing any keyboard combinations.
Virtual or not, you are running Windows on or inside your Mac. So take all
the usual precautions of loading antivirus and other security software.
Comforting, isn’t it, to know that your Mac can do very nicely in a Windows
world?

reading about all the wonderful things Macs can do, it is my unpleasant
duty to point out that bad @#$& happens. Even on a Mac.
Fortunately, most issues are minor. A stubborn mouse. Tired hardware.
Disobedient software. Under the most dire circumstances, your computer or

That said, rarely is a problem beyond fixing. So stay calm, scan through the
pages of this chapter, and with any luck you’ll come across a troubleshooting tip
to solve your problem. If not, I provide recommendations on where seek help.
A Cranky Computer
Your Mac was once a world-class sprinter but now can barely jog. Here are
four possible explanations, and a fix to go with each one.

 Your Mac needs more memory. The programs you’re running may
demand more RAM than you have on hand. I always recommend getting
as much memory as your computer (and wallet) permit. Adding RAM to
the recent class of Mac machines isn’t difficult (check your computer’s
documentation for specifics), though it does involve cracking open the
case and making sure you’re buying the right type of memory.
 Your Mac is running out of hard drive space. This is an easy one:
Remove programs or files you no longer use. There must be something
you can live without. But if every last bit is indispensable, purchase an
additional drive.
 Your Mac’s processor, or CPU, is overtaxed. If you suspect this might
be the case, open the Activity Monitor, which is shown in Figure 20-1, by
choosing Applications➪Utilities. Activity Monitor reveals a lot about the
programs and processes currently running on your machine. Click the
%CPU header to display the applications exacting the heaviest workload
on your CPU (central processing unit). The most demanding are on top.
Quit those you don’t need at the moment.
 The Mac may be trying to save energy. If you’re using a laptop, the Mac
may be slowing the processor purposely. Choose Ú➪System Preferences
and click Energy Saver. Click Options, and use the Processor Performance
pop-up menu to switch from Reduced to Highest.

A Frozen Computer or Program
Mentioning beach balls to anyone but a Mac maven usually conjures up
pleasant images of the surf, sand, and a glorious summer afternoon. Now Mac
people love a day at the beach as much as anybody. But the site of a colorful
spinning beach ball is less welcome on your Apple, at least when that ball
never seems to leave the screen. A beach ball that spins — and spins, and
spins some more — is a sign that a cranky Mac has turned into a frozen Mac
or that at least one of the programs on the machine is throwing a high-tech
temper tantrum. (It isn’t often that a frozen program will crash the entire
system, but it does happen.) Those of you familiar with Windows can think of
this as the Mac equivalent of the hourglass that lingers on-screen.
Your first instinct is to stick a pin inside this virtual spinning beach ball of
death, if only you knew how. If you’re a model of patience, you can attempt to
wait the problem out and hope the spinning eventually stops. If it doesn’t,
consider the options described in this section.
Force Quit
Force Quit is the Mac’s common way of telling an iced application “I’m as
mad as hell and I’m not going to take it anymore.” (If you’re too young, that’s
a reference to the 1976 movie Network, as in television network.)
Choose Ú➪Force Quit or press Ô +Option+Esc. A window like the one in
Figure 20-2 appears. Click the name of the deviant application (not responding
probably appears next to its name). Under Force Quit you typically won’t
have to reboot your computer.
Because you will lose any unsaved changes, Apple throws up a little admoni-
tion before allowing you to Force Quit. Alas, you may have no choice.
Figure 20-2:
Bailing

Force Quit
command.
327
Chapter 20: Handling Trouble in Paradise

Ctrl-clicking a dock icon brings up a pop-up menu whose bottom item is Quit.
If you hold down the Option key, Quit becomes Force Quit.
When a program quits on you
Sometimes, for reasons known to no man (or woman), a program keels over.
Just like that. You could reopen the app and hope this was a one-time aberra-
tion caused by mischievous space aliens en route to the planet Vista. Or you
might have a chronic ailment on your hands.
When programs suddenly drop, you may see dialog boxes with the word
unexpectedly, like the ones shown in Figure 20-3. The box on the left appears
the first time you experience this issue; the box at right shows what happens
if the problem persists. If so, you may want to click Try Again to safely
relaunch the fussy program. OS X restores the application’s default settings
(thus setting aside newer preferences settings), in case something you did
(imagine that?) caused the snafu.
Assuming everything went swell from there, you’ll be given the option of
keeping the new settings upon quitting the program. Your old preferences are
saved in a file with a .saved extension, in case you ever want to go back. If
that is the case, move the newer and current preferences file from its present
location and remove the .saved extension from the older file.
If you feel like doing a good deed and sharing your experience with Apple
(doing your itty-bitty part helps them make things right in the future), you
see a screen like the one in Figure 20-4. Kindly note Apple won’t directly get
in touch with you about the issue.
Figure 20-3:

edly quits . . .

Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

If the problem continues, it may be time to visit the library. No, not that kind
of library. A Preferences folder lives inside your Library folder, which in turn
resides in your Home folder. Whew!.Got it? (And the ankle bone’s connected
to the shin bone, and the shin bone’s connected to the . . .)
These preferences files have the .plist suffix and typically begin with com. fol-
lowed by the name of the program, as in com.microsoft.Word.plist. Try drag-
ging a .plist file with the name of the troubled application out to the desktop.
If the program runs smoothly, trash the corrupted preferences file.
Now just to keep you on your toes, a separate Preferences folder resides
inside a separate Library folder inside your Macintosh HD folder (which you
can click on the left side of the Finder.) You may have to repeat this drill
there.
Forcing a restart
Force Quit will usually rescue you from a minor problem, but it’s not effective
all the time. If that’s the situation you’re in now, you’ll likely have to reboot.
The assumption here is that your frozen computer won’t permit you to start
over in a conventional way by choosing Ú➪Restart.
Instead, try holding down the power button for several seconds or press
Ctrl+Ô and then the power button. If all else fails, pull the plug (or remove
the battery from a laptop), though only as a last resort.

Safe boot
Starting up Tiger in Safe mode activates a series of measures designed to
return your computer to good health. It runs a check of your hard drive (see
the next section), loads only essential kernel extensions (system files) while
ignoring others, trashes what are called font cache files, and disables startup
and login items.
To start in Safe mode, press the power button to turn on your computer, and
press and hold the Shift key the instant you hear the familiar welcome chime.
Release Shift when the Apple logo appears. You’ll know you’ve done it cor-
rectly because the words Safe Boot appear in the login window. (Prior to
Tiger, the words Safe Boot appeared on the OS X startup screen; this feature
was not an option before OS X version 10.2.)
Because of its under-the-hood machinations, it will take considerably longer
to boot in Safe mode. This is perfectly normal. So is the fact that you can’t
use AirPort, a USB modem, or your DVD player, you can’t capture footage in
iMovie, and you can’t use certain other applications or features.
If the Safe boot resolved your issue, restart the Mac normally next time, with-
out pressing Shift. If not, it might be time to check your warranty or call in an
expert, as noted later in this chapter.
Disk Utility
Just about every championship baseball team has a valuable utility player to
fill nearly every position. The versatile Disk Utility tool on your Mac serves
this purpose for all things hard drive–related. At a glance, it gives you a sum-
mary of your drives, including disk capacity, available space, and number of
files and folders.
I’ll concentrate on two of the main tasks Disk Utility performs: repairing dam-
aged disks and fixing bungled permissions, as shown in Figure 20-5. Read the
“Don’t try (most of) this at home” sidebar for a peek at Disk Utility’s other
stunts.
330
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

Permissions granted
As the computer’s administrator, you have the right to open, view, and
modify programs, folders, and files on your drive at will. Other user accounts
on your system (as described in Chapter 5) are given varying privileges to
read and change stuff. To regulate who gets to do what, the Mac has estab-
lished a complex set of permissions.
Sometimes, because of new software you installed or a power glitch, these
permissions get messed up, resulting in programs that freeze or fail to open.
Disk Utility may be your salvation. Frankly, you may want to run the following
steps anyway, as preventive maintenance, particularly if you installed a major
operating system update or a new application:
1. Open Disk Utility in the Utilities folder under Applications, and click
the First Aid tab.
2. In the panel on the left, click to highlight the name of your hard drive.
3. Click Verify Disk Permissions to test permissions without changing
anything (even if a permissions screw up is ultimately revealed) or
click Repair Disk Permission to test and set things straight.
Figure 20-5:
Disk Utility
can fix
permissions
and repair
your hard
drive.
331
Chapter 20: Handling Trouble in Paradise

Don’t try and make heads or tails out of the log of puzzling messages
that may show up in the results window as Disk Utility goes about its
business. They don’t necessarily indicate that your permissions were
actually amiss.
Incidentally, you can only repair permissions on the disk you use to start 
OS X.
Repair job
If you suspect your hard drive is actually damaged (even a reboot doesn’t
seem to do much good), run Verify Disk to uncover any errors. If there are
any, you must be an administrator to authorize a repair. You can’t repair (or
even test) write-protected disks and non-recordable CDs and DVDs.
But the most important restriction is this: Although you can use Disk Utility
to test the drive you’re using (and, as we’ve seen, fix permissions) you can’t
actually repair it until you boot from another disk. This is most likely your
Mac OS X installation CD or DVD, which I hope you can easily lay your hands
on. With that in mind, it’s a good idea to make a copy of your install disc right
now when you’re thinking about it, and stash it in a safe place.
After booting with this other disc, open Disk Utility, select your startup disk,
and click Repair Disk.
Incidentally, booting from the other disc is somewhat tricky. To do so, hold
down the C key and wait until OS X boots. Make a language selection and
select Disk Utility from the drop-down menu.
Get S.M.A.R.T.
After booting from the install disc, you may want to get really S.M.A.R.T. — as
in Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology. When you select a
hard drive in Disk Utility, the S.M.A.R.T. status appears at the bottom of the
window. If the status shows Verified, your disk is in okay shape.
If About to Fail appears in red, you have a ticking time bomb on your hands.
Immediately back up your disk (or, at the very least, critical files) and replace
the disc pronto.
Be aware that you can’t check the S.M.A.R.T. status of all external drives.
332
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

Startup Problems
I just discussed a few ways to get you out of a pickle. But what if you can’t
even get the computer to start?
This is a very unusual circumstance. You probably have no power because
the plug came loose (blame it on the dog or cat), the switch on the power
strip is off, your battery ran out of juice, or there’s a blackout in your neigh-
borhood. Did you even notice that the lights went out?
On some laptops, you can tell if a battery needs recharging by pressing a
small button on the battery. Lights on the battery let you know how much
strength the battery has.
Here’s another thing to try: Press power and hold down the Ô, Option, P, and
R keys and wait until you hear the startup chime a second time.
If you’ve added memory, installed an AirPort Card, or installed another com-
ponent and the machine fails to start, make sure these are installed properly
and try again. If your computer still can’t be revived, try removing the
memory or card you just installed and then give it another shot.
After that, if you still can’t restart, you may have to seek warranty service, as
discussed later in this chapter.
333
Chapter 20: Handling Trouble in Paradise
Don’t try (most of) this at home
Some of Disk Utility’s other capabilities are
downright scary for the novice user but worth
mentioning just the same. For instance, you can
use Disk Utility to erase your disks so that files
can’t be recovered. Unless you’re a world-class
spy, you do not want to do this.
The program can partition, or break up, your
drive into separate volumes that Tiger treats as
discrete disks.
Disk Utility can also create disk images, which
are electronic files that store other files and
folders and can be used for multiple purposes,
such as backing up, hauling files from one Mac
to another, and e-mailing files.
And here’s a techie mouthful if ever there was
one: Disk Utility can also create a RAID scheme,
geek talk for Redundant Array of Independent
Disks. It’s a method of using several separate
hard drives as a single volume.

Reinstalling OS X
If a problem has truly brought your computer to its knees, it may be time to
reinstall your favorite operating system. It’s bad enough that you have to
suffer through the hassle. (Remember that lengthy interrogation way back in
Chapter 2?) Moreover, you’re understandably panicked about retaining files
and user settings.
Remain calm. Then do the following:
1. Insert the OS X installation disk in your CD or DVD drive.
2. Double-click the Install Mac OS X icon and go through the usual instal-
lation drill.
3. When asked, choose your current OS X disk as your destination disk
(which in all likelihood is your only option anyway).
4. Click Options.
You’ve arrived at an important point in the process.
5. If you want to salvage existing files and settings, select Archive and
Install and then Preserve Users and Networks Settings. If you prefer
starting anew, select Erase and Install, keeping in mind that you can’t
undo it.
6. Click Continue.
7. To install certain parts of OS X, click Customize. To perform Apple’s
recommended basic installation, click Install.
8. Because the OS X disk you have may not have all the latest tweaks,
pay a visit to Software Update (found in the Ú menu) to bring Tiger up
to date.
A retail version of OS X may differ some from the version that was loaded on
your computer.
Reinstalling OS 9
Reinstalling OS 9 or, for that matter, running so-called Classic apps, is no
longer an option under Intel Macs (see the “Turn-of-the-century Macs” side-
bar). But if you have an older machine, you can install a Mac OS 9 System
folder with an OS 9 install CD or OS X installation discs. If the former, hold
down the C key as your Mac restarts. This will let you start from the disc in
your optical drive. If using an OS X disc, insert the Additional Software &
Hardware Test disc. Then double-click Install Additional Software and you’ll
be guided on-screen from there.

Common Fixes to Other Problems
Your computer won’t have to visit the emergency room or undergo major
surgery. But a little first aid is probably in order here and there. In this sec-
tion, I consider some minor snags.
A jumpy mouse
Real mice live for dust and grime. And so for a long time did computer
rodents. But the optical-style mice included with the most recent Macs don’t
get stuck like their ancestors because this kind of critter doesn’t use the little
dust-collecting rolling ball on its underbelly.
Be aware that optical mice don’t particularly like glass or reflective surfaces,
so if you find your mouse on one, use a mouse pad or slip a piece of paper
underneath.
If your mouse doesn’t respond at all, unplug it from the USB port and then plug
it in again, just to make sure the connection is snug. If you have a wireless
mouse, make sure the batteries are fresh.
335
Chapter 20: Handling Trouble in Paradise
Turn-of-the-century Macs
Back in 1999, people fretted about Y2K. Bill
Clinton was acquitted in his impeachment trial.
Lance Armstrong captured the first of his Tour
de France titles. During the fall of that year,
Apple introduced OS 9, the beginning of the end
for what came to be known as the Classic Mac
operating system. OS 9 finally yielded to some-
thing new and better in 2001, the more robust
OS X, our Mac playground throughout this book.
(Before the fact checkers come after me, OS X
was available as a public beta in 2000.) 
The very next year, Steve Jobs presided over a
mock funeral for OS 9 at a conference. Apple’s
boss mournfully lifted an OS 9 box out of a
casket and quipped, “He’s now in that great bit
bucket in the sky.” OS 9 was still breathing,
though. Macs sold early in the 21st century
could start in the new operating system through
an OS 9 simulator called Classic mode. Macs
sold after January 2003 would start only in OS
X, though folks could continue to use older soft-
ware through OS X’s Classic environment.
This too would not last. In 2006, with the intro-
duction of the Intel Macs, Apple announced that
Classic would no longer be supported. OS 9
finally entered the history books. There’s not
much to running Classic apps (if your computer
is capable). Double-click an OS 9 program, and
the Classic environment kicks into gear. If visi-
ble, you can also click the number 9 icon in the
OS X menu bar and choose Start Classic.

Meanwhile, if you want to change the speed of your on-screen mouse pointer
or want to change clicking speeds, visit Keyboard & Mouse under System
Preferences, as described in Chapter 4.
A stuck CD
It’s really cool the way most Macs practically suck up a CD. Here’s what’s not
cool: when your mouse won’t spit out the disc.
Take a stab at one of these fixes:
 Quit the program using the disc and then press Eject on the keyboard.
 Open a Finder window, and click the little eject icon in the sidebar. Or
try dragging the disc icon from the Mac desktop to the trash.
 Log out of your user account (under the Ú menu) and then press Eject
on the keyboard.
 Restart the computer while holding down the mouse button.
My Mac can no longer tell time
If your computer can no longer keep track of the time and date, its internal
backup battery may have bit the dust. You can’t replace the battery yourself,
so you’ll have to contact the Apple store or an authorized service provider.
The wrong program answers 
the call of duty
The Mac makes certain assumptions about which application ought to open a
particular file when summoned. For example, Preview is Tiger’s document
viewer of choice and routinely handles JPEG graphics and PDF documents,
while DOC files are the province of Microsoft Word. But say you want the
Adobe programs Photoshop and Reader to be responsible for JPEGs and
PDFs, and Mac’s own word processor, TextEdit, to take care of DOC duties?
Here’s what to do:
1. Highlight the icon of the program you want opened by a different
application and press Ô+I.
336
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

2. In the Get Info panel that appears, click the right-facing triangle next
to Open With and choose the application to handle the document
from here on out, as shown in Figure 20-6.
In this example, I’ve taken a DOC file that would otherwise open in Word
and put TextEdit in charge. Incidentally, if you want to open the file from
a different parent than Apple suggests, choose Other from the drop-
down list.
Alternatively, access the Open With command by highlighting the file
icon in question and choosing File➪Open With. You can also bring up
the Get Info pane from the same menu. Still another way to get to Open
With: Press control while clicking the icon (or right-click if your mouse
has two buttons).
3. If you want the application to open each and every file you beckon in
the future, click Change All.

Chapter 20: Handling Trouble in Paradise

Kernel clink
Out of the blue, you are asked to restart your computer. In numerous lan-
guages, no less. Your machine has been hit with a kernel panic. The probable
cause is corrupted or incompatible software. (One of these panics can also
be induced by damaged hardware, although that is highly unlikely.)
The good news is that a system restart usually takes care of the problem with
no further harm. If not, try removing any memory or hardware you’ve
recently added. Of if you think some new software you installed may have
been the culprit, head to the software publisher’s Web site and see whether
they’ve issued a downloadable fix or upgrade. 
SOS for DNS
If you’re surfing the Web with Safari or another browser and get a message
about a DNS entry not being found, you typed the wrong Web address or
URL, the site in question no longer exists (or never did), or the site is having
temporary problems. DNS is computer jargon for Domain Name System.
Similar messages may be presented as a 404 not found on this server error.
Curing the trash can blues
In the physical world, you may try and throw something out of your trash but
can’t because the rubbish gets stuck to the bottom of the can. The virtual
trash can on your Mac sometimes suffers a similar fate: A file refuses to
budge when you click Empty Trash under the Finder menu.
Try junking the files by holding down the Option key when you choose Empty
Trash.
There are a few possible explanations why a file refuses to go quietly. For
starters, you can’t delete an item that is open somewhere else on your com-
puter, so make sure it’s indeed closed. Moreover, you may be trying to ditch a
file to which you do not have sufficient permission. The other most likely
explanation is that a locked file is in the trash. You can unlock it by choosing
File➪Get Info and making sure the Locked box is unchecked.
After a program unexpectedly crashes, one or more Recovered Files folders
may appear in your trash after a restart. Temporary files are often used and
disposed of by your applications, but during a crash these may not get dis-
posed. If any of these files are valuable, drag them out of trash. More often
than not, however, it is safe to discard them with the rest of the garbage.
338
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

Useful Routine Maintenance
Your computer can use some TLC every so often. Here are a few tips for help-
ing it out.
Purge unnecessary files and programs
If you’ve had your Mac for awhile, you’ve probably piled on programs and
files that no longer serve a purpose. Maybe they’re drivers associated with a
printer you replaced a couple of years ago. Maybe it’s software you fell out of
love with. Even if these files aren’t slowing the system down, they’re hogging
disk space. These programs may even be agitating in the background. The
Activity Monitor I mentioned earlier in this chapter may clue you in.
Bottom line: It’s time to send these files and programs off to retirement for
good (with a generous severance package, of course). You already know how
to trash files. But it’s not always obvious which files to dispose of. Some pro-
grams leave shrapnel all over your hard drive.
Type the name of the application you are getting rid of inside a Finder search
box and do your best to determine whether files shown in the results are
associated with the application you want to blow off.
Don’t delete files that you know little or nothing about. The consequences
aren’t pretty if you accidentally trash a crucial system file. If you do throw
unfamiliar files in the trash, wait a day or so until you’re satisfied that you
don’t need them.
Backing up your treasures
I know I’ve beaten you on the head with this throughout the book. Consider
this the final nag. Back up. Back up. Back up. Whether you use Disk Utility,
Mac’s Backup, third-party software, or another method, JUST DO IT. SOONER
THAN LATER. There, I’ve finished shouting.
Repair permissions
For information on repair permissions, see the “Disk Utility” section, earlier
in this chapter.
339
Chapter 20: Handling Trouble in Paradise

Updating software
As a matter of course, visit Software Update under System Preferences or in
the Ú menu, or arrange to have your Mac check regularly for updates. I
update weekly, but you can have your computer do it as often as every day
or as infrequently as monthly (which I don’t recommend). If you’re passing
through System Preferences for any other reason, you can always go to
Software Update and click Check Now.
Head over to the support areas of the Web sites of the publishers of other
software on your computer to see whether they’ve updated their programs.
The download is typically free.
Summoning Outside Help
Pretty much everything I’ve described in this chapter up to now is something
you ought to be able to handle on your own. But eventually you’ll run into sit-
uations beyond your expertise, especially if you face a serious hardware
issue. Or perhaps you merely lack the time, patience, inclination, or confi-
dence. I understand your reluctance. Fortunately, you can find help in plenty
of places, though the help is not always free.
Third-party software
For all the fine troubleshooting tools included on a Mac, you may at times
want to look to outside software. In this section I describe some of the pro-
grams that may bail you out of a jam or help with routine maintenance Prices
and version numbers are subject to change. If you have an Intel Mac, make
sure you get the Universal version.

AppleCare
Your Mac comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a year of free
support at an authorized Apple retailer. The extended warranty program
called AppleCare lengthens the time you can get free phone support to three
years (from the day of purchase).
AppleCare covers the computer itself plus AirPort Express and Extreme base sta-
tions and Apple RAM (used with the Mac, of course). Certain models, including
Mac Mini, let you also cover one Apple display if purchased at the same time.
Fees depend on the gear you’re covering: AppleCare for an Apple display is
$99; Mac Mini, $149; iMac or eMac, $169; MacBook, Power Mac, $249;

Consulting Einstein
One of the features of the Apple retail store is the Genius Bar. Apple’s in-store
experts can answer questions about your Mac and, if need be, install memory
and handle repairs (for a fee). My own experience leads me to believe that
these (mostly) young men and women are quite knowledgeable about the
subjects you’re likely to hit them with. Judging by blog posts, however, not all
of them are ready for Mensa. Now the bad news. You can’t exactly mosey up
to the Genius bar. Which leads me to . . .
Making a reservation
Meeting up with an Apple-branded Genius requires an appointment. Go to
www.apple.com/retail and click the Apple store near you. Look for Apple
Store Concierge and click Make a Reservation. You’ll have to sign in as a
Guest or ProCare member (see the next section). You can stake a claim on
the next available opening.
If you’re already in an Apple store and it’s not crowded, make a reservation
on the spot using one of the Macs in the store.
While in the store (or perusing the Web site), you may want to check the
schedule of free classes, including various workshops in iLife, iWeb, and OS X.
Consulting a pro
As a ProCare member, you can book an appointment with a Genius at the
store of your choice up to a week in advance. At $99 a year, ProCare isn’t
cheap, but you get the following princely privileges: priority repairs, a free
hour of one-on-one training on topics you choose, admission to creative
Studio classes in certain stores, an annual computer tune-up (systems diag-
nostics, a cleaning for your display and keyboard, and more) and help setting
up a new machine.
Help, I need somebody
It sounds like a cliché, but free (or low-cost) help is all around you:
 The geeky next-door neighbor, your cubicle-mate, or the friends you
didn’t know you had on the World Wide Web.
 At a social networking site such as Meetup.com, you can search for and
perhaps find a Macintosh user group meeting in your neck of the woods.
342
Part V: The Creepy Geeky Section 

 Get referrals from Apple at www.apple.com/usergroups. You’ll find a
national and local events calendar, and you can enter your Zip code to
find a group close by.
 For free online answers, poke around the newsgroups and computer bul-
letin boards, as described in Chapter 11.
 Check out the knowledge base of searchable troubleshooting articles at
www.apple.com/support.
 Before leaving a chapter on troubleshooting and the geek section of this
book, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention one other avenue for help. It’s the
Help menu found with most every program you use. To be sure, not
every one of your questions will be answered or answered satisfactorily.
But before heading on a wild goose chase in search of an enlightening
response, give the Help menus a try. They’ve been right there all along.

In this part . . .

’m always volunteering my top ten movie lists for

T
hink of the Dashboard widgets of Chapter 6 fame as a reflection of our
busy lives. We’re all distracted, pressed for time, going every which way.
We generally know what we want, and we want it now. In this fast food soci-
ety, snack software seems inevitable.
In this chapter, I present in alphabetical order a list of ten yummy widgets.
With more than 2,000 widgets available as of this writing, you can easily come
up with a menu of ten more widgets, and ten more after that. And so on. To
find them, head to www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard.
Cocktail
Can you mix an, um, Apple Martini? Kamikaze? Or Piper at the Gates of Dawn?
The free Cocktail widget from Seven lets you impress buddies with your bar-
tender skills. Just type the drink you have in mind. Cocktail’s database
includes nearly 7,000 drink recipes. Click “Feelin Thirsty?” for a random selec-
tion. With its martini-glass icon, shown in Figure 21-1, Cocktail has one of the
better-looking widgets too.

Countdown Plus
Hmm. Steven Chaitoff’s simple Countdown Plus widget tells you how much
time is remaining until a specified date, such as the newborn’s due date, your
next vacation, your anniversary, or the day you’ll be paroled.
Gas
I loath paying a small ransom at the pump. Gas from Interdimension Media
might help you save a few pennies per gallon. The widget promises updated
information from GasPriceWatch.com. You can sort results by Regular, Plus,
Premium, or Diesel and find stations within 20 miles of a designated Zip code.
What’s more, click the address of the gas station of choice, and the widget
fires up Google Maps on your browser.
The Gas widget is free, but its producers hope you’ll donate some of your
savings to them (via PayPal). You can display the widget with a pole, as
shown in Figure 21-2, or without.
Hurricane Tracker
If you live or expect to vacation in an area affected by hurricanes, Hurricane
Tracker from Travel Widgets is a useful resource (see Figure 21-3). Roll the
mouse pointer over the widget and click the little i on the bottom-right
corner of the screen. That takes you to the back of the widget, where you can
choose the location you’re monitoring (such as Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or
Northeast Pacific). Or choose how you want satellite images to appear
(Visible, Infrared, Water Vapor).

Morse Code Translator
.../---/... SOS is about the only thing I recall about Morse code from my Boy
Scout days, but that doesn’t matter thanks to Morse Code Translator, shown
in Figure 21-4. This nifty widget teaches you the Morse alphabet and converts
text to Morse code and Morse code to text. Just remember to have the Mac
handy when you have to send a distress signal from your yacht.
Oh, and you may also want to memorize the following dots and dashes:
--/-.--//-.-/---/--/.--./..-/-/./.-.//.--/---/-.//-//.../-/.-/.-./-
That’s Morse code for my computer won’t start.
Reverse Phone Lookup
The Reverse Phone Lookup is a handy widget for anyone who has ever written
down a phone number on a scrap of paper and forgotten to jot the person’s
name or sees a number but no name on Caller ID. Type the area code and
phone number; if the listing is public, you’ll see the name and address.
pearLyrics/Sing that iTune
Sad refrain. One of my favorite widgets, pearLyrics, is no longer available,
apparently over legal disputes with some in the music industry. I included
Figure 21-4:
“Dot dot dot,
dash dash
dash.” The
Morse Code
Translator
widget.
350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

pearLyrics because it still works on my machine and the idea behind it is so
appealing to any music fan who has ever wanted to sing along but can’t
remember the words. Besides, you can still download a similar widget called
Sing that iTune.
The two widgets display the lyrics of songs you’re listening to in iTunes, at
least some of the time. Unlike Sing that iTune, pearLyrics does not display
album cover art. But in my experience, it uncovered lyrics far more often and
delivered them more quickly than Sing that iTune.
If no lyrics are found, you could click directly onto the pearLyrics widget to
initiate a Google search for the words. Moreover, if you click the lyrics dis-
played inside the widget, they are copied to your clipboard. Who knows,
maybe pearLyrics will return by the time you read this. In the meanwhile,
check out Sing that iTune.
Send SMS
SMS stands for Short Message Service, a popular global standard for dis-
patching text messages to cell phones. This widget from Alco Bolm Software
lets you send text messages to a mobile phone from your keyboard. You type
your missive in the area provided on the front of the widget, and then click to
flip it over to enter a recipient and a phone number.
Your first purchase totals $15 (you can pay through PayPal) and covers the
$10 annual fee and first 50 SMS messages ($5).Or check out a free alternative
such as Keaka Jackson’s SMS, found at http://keakaj.com/sms.htm.
Wikipedia
With the free collaborative Wikipedia encyclopedia, which I describe in
Chapter 11, you can search on most any topic imaginable. Or try clicking the
little “?” button next to the search field to display an article randomly, on sub-
jects ranging from the Danish parliamentary election of 1975 to Modern Kung
Fu. Keep in mind that anyone can contribute to a Wikipedia entry, so the infor-
mation you uncover may be open to interpretation and possibly inaccurate.
Click the Wikipedia button in the widget to jump to the full Wikipedia site.

Chapter 21: Ten Clever Dashboard Widgets

Word of the Day
I’m feeling rather sedulous. After all, I’m diligent in my application or pursuit
and steadily industrious. Besides, sedulous is my Word of the Day, delivered
by a widget of the same name. Definitions (like the one provided in the sen-
tence before this one) are supplied by Dictionary.com.
Apparently lots of folks are seeking to bolster their vocabulary. In requesting
a PayPal donation, developer haym37.com says about 100,000 people refresh
or load the widget daily, placing an enormous strain on the company’s
servers.

n my line of work, I often get the “how come you didn’t” e-mail or phone
call, as in “how come you didn’t write about my company or product?” So I
won’t be shocked to hear folks asking about this chapter, “how come you
didn’t choose my favorite Macintosh Web site?” Limiting any list to ten is
exceedingly difficult. Especially when it comes to Web sites about your
trusted computer. Please know that I know there are terrific sites that are not
on this list. With that, here goes.
Macrank
www.macrank.com
You might say I was a tad defensive at the top of this chapter, alluding to all
the Web sites I would not mention. Well, chances are you’ll find your favorite
cyberdestinations at Macrank, which ranks the top 100 sites for the Mac and
iPod. Visitors to Macrank can rate sites from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest) and
add a comment.

MacFixIt
www.macfixit.com
When something has gone wrong and you’re still seeking answers despite my
best efforts in Chapter 20, check out MacFixIt. This troubleshooting site tack-
les a gaggle of issues, though you’ll have to pay $24.95 a year for full access
to more than a decade of content. Among the many topics I came across were
making banking sites work with Safari; unresponsive keyboards; iMovie: “Disk
Responded Slowly” alerts; and “Trackpad button clicks not registering” in the
MacBook.
MacOSX Hints
www.macosxhints.com
At the MacOSX Hints site, you can learn to create a partitioned RAID setup,
convert PowerPoint graphic metafiles, and secure e-mail with digital certifi-
cates. As you can see, some of the searchable hints can get pretty technical.
MacRumors
www.macrumors.com
Apple is one of the most secretive outfits on the planet. Seldom does the
company spill the beans on new products in advance. That doesn’t prevent
numerous Apple watchers from speculating on what might be coming out of
Cupertino. Besides, who doesn’t love a juicy rumor now and then? Is Apple
merging with Nintendo? Is Apple coming out with a higher quality iTunes?
Head to MacRumors for the latest dirt.
MacSurfer
www.macsurfer.com
MacSurfer is a wonderful resource for the Apple news junkie. MacSurfer’s
Headline News sports links to articles on all things Apple, including traditional

media, Web sites, Apple itself, and bloggers. Links are segregated by Apple/
Macintosh, OS X, General Interest/Potpourri, Apple Hardware/Software,
Reviews/How-To/Tutorials/Tips, Analysis/Commentary/Editorial/Opinion,
Press Releases/Products/Public Relations, Computer Industry, Finances, and
more.
Macworld
www.macworld.com
It’s all here at Macworld: news (via MacCentral.com), troubleshooting through
blogs such as Mac 911, product reviews, and current and past articles from
Macworld magazine.
The Unofficial Apple Weblog
www.tuaw.com
The Unofficial Apple Weblog (tuaw) is an enthusiast’s blog that lets people
comment on Apple articles and reviews written by the likes of yours truly in
USA TODAY. (Sure it’s a shameless plug for me and my paper, but we are near-
ing the end of the book. And there are plenty of links to articles by lots of
other journalists.)
Think Secret
www.thinksecret.com
Did I mention that Apple keeps things close to the vest? Think Secret digs for
inside Apple dope and often finds it. In fact, in 2005, Apple sued the 19-year-old
running Think Secret (claiming theft of trade secrets). Think Secret correctly
reported on what became the Mac Mini and iPod Shuffle, prior to the launch of
those products. (Apple came after two other sites at the time, PowerPage.org
and Apple Insider.) For all the leaking coming out of Washington, obviously
Silicon Valley has its moles too.

VersionTracker
www.versiontracker.com
VersionTracker is a repository for downloadable shareware, freeware, and
updates to Mac software. Click a name to learn more about what a program
does and to eyeball ratings and feedback.
And Last but Not Least, Apple.com
www.apple.com
Apple may seem like an obvious place to go. Heck, you probably already
landed there just by opening Safari the first time. And you may not love the
full blitz of Mac and iPod advertising and promotions, even if you already
drank Apple’s Kool-Aid. But presumably most of you already have sweet feel-
ings for the company’s products.
As I hinted at in Chapter 20, www.apple.com is full of helpful resources,
especially for, but not limited to, newbies. You can download software
updates and manuals, post questions in discussion forums, read press
releases, and consult the knowledge base. Mostly, I think, you’ll walk away
with a renewed sense of good will for the company responsible for the com-
puter most of you fancy so much.

S
o here we are hundreds of pages into this book and there’s still more to
tell. Truth is, I could probably go on for hundreds more pages and still
not do justice to everything your Mac can accomplish (with more than a little
help from you, of course.) So even though the programs, functions, or capa-
bilities covered in this chapter didn’t quite make it into the book elsewhere,
don’t consider them unloved or an afterthought.
At the risk of tossing another well-worn cliché your way, last is most defi-
nitely not least.
Remote Madness
Roughly the size of a Bic disposable lighter or an iPod Shuffle, the simple
iPod-white Apple remote, which the company has started including with
recent Mac models, has minimal buttons: play/pause, volume up/down, fast-
forward, rewind, and Menu. It’s main purpose is to control the friendly icons

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
and menus that make up the new Front Row interface (mentioned in Chapter
4) that lets you listen to music, and view photos, DVDs, and videos from
across the room. But the multitalented Apple remote can also help you listen
to an iPod, provided it has what’s called a Universal Dock connector. 
But suppose you have more than one Mac that’s compatible with the remote
control or an Apple accessory such as iPod Hi-Fi. You may want to pair the
remote with a specific computer or other gear so that pressing the button
doesn’t make all the machines in one room bump heads. Here’s how: Move
the remote within three or four inches of the Mac and press and hold the fast
forward and Menu buttons at the same time for five seconds. A little chain
link symbol appears onscreen to tell you the pairing has been completed.
The Apple remote adheres to an iMac through a small magnet on the bottom
right side of the computer. This arrangement makes it convenient to stow
away. But wouldn’t you know, there’s a warning in the iMac manual to avoid
putting an external hard drive, iPod, memory card, or other magnetic media
too close to the magnet. I’m not sure any company can write a manual these
days without putting in such warnings to satisfy lawyers. Because I’m pretty
sure I’ve placed my iPod near the magnet without causing any damage. That
said, follow or ignore this advice at your own risk.
If Math Moves You
I don’t pretend to know a Conchoid (Figure 23-1) from a Lorentz’s Attractor;
the mathematics are frankly lost on me. But the Grapher bundled with Tiger
and accessed through the Utilities folder (under Applications) lets you graph
two- and three-dimensional mathematical equations. Moreover, the program’s
animations are pretty darn cool. And if you’re curious about what the afore-
mentioned Conchoid, Lorentz’s Attractor, and other 2D and 3D formulas and
equations look like, click the names in the Grapher Examples menu. 
Speaking Another Language
Way back when you first set up your computer, you selected the language
you wanted to use. But circumstances change. You suddenly have the oppor-
tunity to run your company’s Rome office, and now you must immerse your-
self in Italian. 
To change your computer’s preferred language, choose System Preferences
from the Ú menu and select International. Click the Language tab, as shown
in Figure 23–2. Drag the language you want to use for application menus,
dialog boxes, and so forth to the top of the language list.

Figure 23-2:
The Mac is
multilingual.

359
Chapter 23: Ten Things to Leave You With

Next, click the Formats tab under International to choose the region you live
in, customize dates, time, and native currency, or decide whether to go
metric or use the U.S. system of measurement.
If you also click the Input Menu tab, you can choose a different keyboard
layout, such as the Japanese Kana Palette or the Korean Hangul.
Zip It in the Bud 
Files you download off the Internet are often compressed or zipped — and for
good reason. Zipped files take up less space and arrive much faster than files
that haven’t been squeezed down. 
Compressed files are easily identified by their extensions, such as .zip (a
common standard used in OS X and Windows) and .sit. Such files must be
unzipped before you can read them. Prior to Tiger, Apple included a program
for this purpose called StuffIt Expander from Allume Systems. But Tiger lets
you decompress .zip files sans StuffIt. 
StuffIt still comes in handy, though, for opening other types of compressed
files, notably the .sit or .sitx compressed types. Go to www.stuffit.com/
mac/index.html to download a free version of the software or to splurge
for the Deluxe version (around $80, though I’ve seen it discounted for much
less). In addition to shrinking files to a fraction of their size, StuffIt Deluxe lets
you encrypt and back up files.
Meanwhile, you can archive or create your own .zip files through Tiger. Right-
click (or Ctrl-click) files you want to compress inside Finder and choose
Create Archive Of. The newly compressed files carry the .zip extension. The
archive is created in the same location as the original file and is named 
originalfilename.zip.
FYI on FTP
FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, sites are typically set up by companies or indi-
viduals to make it easy to exchange sizable files over the Internet, typically
but not exclusively video or picture files. The Mac has a built-in FTP server
for giving other folks access to your machine. 
To grant such access, choose Ú➪System Preferences, and click Sharing.
Make sure the Services tab is highlighted. In the Service window, select FTP
Access, shown in Figure 23-3. People on other computers can now share and
copy files to and from your machine. 
360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Don’t take this step lightly. Consider the security ramifications before allow-
ing just anyone access to your machine. 
Now suppose you want to access somebody else’s FTP site. From the Finder
Menu, choose Go➪Connect to Server. Enter the server address in the box
provided and click Connect. Depending on the server you’re attempting to
connect to, you’ll likely have to enter a name and a password. 
You may be able to drag and drop files from your machine onto that FTP
server. But often you need help from outside software. I rely on a $25 share-
ware program called Fetch (available at www.fetchsoftworks.com) to
dump files onto an FTP server. Other fine FTP choices including Transmit
(www.panic.com) and RBrowser (www.rbrowser.com).
Screen Capture
Unless you’re planning on writing a book similar to this one, you’re probably
wondering why the heck you’d ever want to take a picture of your computer
screen. Let me suggest a couple of possibilities: maybe you want to take a
picture of the screen for a presentation at work. Or perhaps you want to
show precisely what a funky error looks like to the person who just might
help you correct the problem. (Then again maybe you really are going to
write a book like this.)
Figure 23-3:
Granting
FTP access.
361
Chapter 23: Ten Things to Leave You With

Regardless of motivation, if you want to grab a picture of the Mac screen (or
any of its windows) it may be time to open the Grab utility. Go to
Applications➪Utilities and click Grab. Through Grab’s Capture menu, you can
take a picture of a full screen, window, or menu, as follows: 
 Select Window (or press Shift+Ô+W), click Choose Window, then click
the window to grab its picture. 
 Select Screen (or press Ô+Z). Then to capture the full screen, click any-
where outside the window that appears. 
 Select Timed Screen (or press Shift+Ô+Z) to capture the full screen 10
seconds after clicking Start Timer in the window that shows up. This
gives you a chance to prepare the screen to your liking (perhaps by acti-
vating a menu) before the image is captured.
 Select Selection (or Shift+cmd+A). Then use the mouse to drag over the
portion of the screen you want to grab.
Still other universal system shortcuts follow, without you having to open the
Grab utility:
 Press Ô+Shift+3 to take a picture of the whole screen.
 Press Ô+Shift+4 and drag the mouse to select the part of the screen you
want to grab.
 Press Ô+Shift+4, and then press the spacebar. Move the pointer to high-
light an area you want in the picture, and then click. This is useful for
taking a picture of, say, the menu bar or dock. If you press the spacebar
again, you can select the area by dragging the mouse instead. Press the
Escape key to cancel.
Screen shots captured in this matter are saved as files on the desktop. If
you’d rather paste the captured image into a document, press the Control
key when you press the other keyboard combinations, which places the pic-
ture in the Clipboard. From there, you can paste the image into your chosen
document. 
Watching TV on a Mac
For all its multimedia glitz, none of the Mac models, at least as of this writing,
comes with a built-in television tuner. It’s one of the few areas in which
machines based on Microsoft’s Media Center software claim bragging rights.
Not only do such Media Center machines let you watch TV directly from your
computer screen, but they function much like TiVo digital video recorders or
DVRs. Among other stunts that means you can pause and rewind “live” TV
362
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

and record shows to watch on your schedule, not the one some network pro-
gramming exec has in mind.
Just because Apple hasn’t gotten around to putting a TV tuner in the Mac, the
same cannot be said of third-party companies. For example, Miglia’s TVMini
HD (about $250) is a compact HDTV tuner that plugs into a USB port. It lets
you watch over-the-air digital TV and HDTV, and record high-definition pro-
gramming to your hard drive. And yes, like TiVo, you can pause and rewind
live TV. Go to www.miglia.com for more information or visit the online
Apple store.
I also recommend checking out the various EyeTV options from Elgato Systems.
To find the appropriate EyeTV product, visit www.elgatosystems.com and
indicate the country you live in and the source of your television program-
ming (standard analog cable, satellite, HDTV, digital cable, and so on). Elgato
will help you find a match.
Read Magazines
The next version of OX X, dubbed Leopard, is on the way (and may have hit
the market by the time you read this). It’s practically a given stuff will change.
By its nature, technology is a scorching hot, competitive, time-sensitive busi-
ness and Apple moves more quickly than most. So while I trust the informa-
tion in this book will prove useful for the foreseeable if not long-term future, I
have to admit some of the info will go stale. An excellent way to stay current
is to regularly peek at some of the prominent Mac-oriented magazines, includ-
ing MacAddict, MacHome, and Macworld.
Would You Like to Play 
a Game of Chess?
Ah, the question posed by the (ultimately) defiant Hal 9000 computer in the
classic film 2001: A Space Odyssey. Turns out, your Mac can play a rather
mean game of chess too, without, as HAL did, turning on its human masters.
The Mac’s Chess program, found in the Applications folder, lets you compete
against the computer or a human partner. 
What’s more, by accessing Preferences under the Chess menu, you can
change the board style and pieces from the wooden board shown in Figure
23-4 to grass, marble, or metal. You can also drag a slider inside Chess
Preferences to make the computer play faster or stronger. 
363
Chapter 23: Ten Things to Leave You With

Just like HAL, your Mac can speak as it makes its moves — in about two
dozen voices, no less, from Deranged (probably appropriate for HAL) to
Hysterical. Then again, you can speak back, so long as Allow Player to Speak
Moves is checked in Preferences. Try it out for size: “Pawn e2 to e4 to move
the white king’s pawn,” for example.
Which leads me to the next section.
Speech Recognition
Are you the bossy type who likes to bark out orders? If so, you’ll love that the
Mac can respond to your spoken commands, everything from “Quit this
application” to “Switch to Finder.” And for people physically unable to type
or handle a mouse, speech recognition may be their only avenue to getting
things done on a computer. 
Open System Preferences, again under the app menu, and choose Speech.
Make sure the Speech Recognition pane is selected, as shown in Figure 23-5.
Now, click to turn on the Speakable Items button. Figure 23-6 shows the
Figure 23-4:
Your move.
364
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

round microphone feedback window that appears on your desktop, with the
key or keyword you need to press to alert the Mac that you are about to
speak. You expect the computer to respond accordingly. The Escape key han-
dles this task by default.
To check out a list of the commands your computer can understand, click the
little triangle at the bottom of the feedback window and then click Open
Speech Commands window.
Click Calibrate to improve the performance of your internal (or connected)
microphone. The calibration process involves adjusting a slider (see Figure
23-7) and speaking aloud the phrases listed on the screen (such as Open a
document and Show me what to say) until the computer makes these phrases
blink in recognition. 
Figure 23-6:
The speech-
feedback
window.
Figure 23-5:
The Mac is

free speech.
365
Chapter 23: Ten Things to Leave You With

If you want to have fun with speech, ask the Mac out loud to tell you a joke. It
will respond with a lame “Knock knock” joke like this one:
“Knock knock.”
“Who’s there?” 
“Thistle.”
“Thistle who?” 
“Thistle be my last knock knock joke.”
Thistle, um, be my last joke too.
