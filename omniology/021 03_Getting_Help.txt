The man pages, short for manual pages, are a
built-in form of documentation available on
nearly all UNIX-like operating systems.
The specific contents vary from one operating
system to another, but at a bare minimum the
man pages include information on commands
and their usage.
man pages

To read the specific piece of documentation
associated with a given command, 
run man command 
For example, to learn more about the ncal
command we could run man ncal
This displays a bunch of information on ncal that
we can scroll through.  Type "q" to exit.

man ncal

In general, each man page will follow this
pattern:
- The title/name of the command with a short
explanation of its purpose
- Synopsis of the command's syntax
- Description of the all the command's options

ncal [-31bhJeoSM] [-A number] [-B number] [-d yyyy-mm] [year]
man pages synopsis
Anything listed inside of square brackets is OPTIONAL.  The only required part is ncal.
The above synopsis for ncal tells us that we can use the following options without providing
any sort of additional parameter:  -3, -1, -b, -h, -J, -e, -o, -S, and -M. To keep things brief,
they are all lumped together as [-31bhJeoSM]
Then, we see other options in square brackets followed by their expected parameters: 
[-A number] means the -A option expects a number.    [-d yyyy-mm] indicates that the -d
option expects us to pass in a date in the format: yyyy-mm like 1980-04
Finally, at the end we see [year] which means that we can pass a year as a parameter

echo [OPTION]... [STRING]...
man pages synopsis
The above synopsis is for the echo command, which echoes text back at us.
An ellipsis (...) indicates that one or more of the proceeding operand are allowed: 
[OPTION]... means that we can pass more than one option to echo
[STRING]... indicates that we can pass multiple strings to echo.  For example, we can run
echo hello and also echo hello there you cutie little chicken pot pie

cp [OPTION]... SOURCE DEST
man pages synopsis
So far, all of the operands we've seen have been optional, but some commands do require
certain arguments in order to run.  In a man page synopsis, required operands are NOT
wrapped in square brackets.  
In the above synopsis for the copy (cp) command, we see that we can optionally provide
one or more options.  SOURCE indicates that we must pass one source, and DEST indicates
that we must pass a destination as well.  Those two arguments are required.

We can search for a term within the manual using the -k option.  
For example, to search the manual for "dog" we would run man -k dog

/bin, /usr/bin, or /usr/local/bin.  These
are compiled binary files (hence bin)
A built-in shell command.  These commands
are part of the shell (bash in our case)

To find the exact location of an executable,

Some commands do not have man pages
written for them, because they are commands
that are directly built in to the shell.
We can find documentation for those commands
using the help command. 
For example, to learn more about the cd
command we would run help cd
Help!
