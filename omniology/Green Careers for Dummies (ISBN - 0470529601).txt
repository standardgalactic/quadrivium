Dedication
To my parents and my brother, Tom, for the times we shared as a family: 
camping throughout California, road trips to National Parks in the western 
U.S. and Canada, cross-country camping trip for the Bicentennial, time in 
the woods of Dover, New Jersey, and Fourth Lake in upstate New York. I will 
never forget the ad hoc biology labs and physics discussions! 
To Kent Fields, my husband and co-founder of Green Career Central, for our 
shared passion for nature: trips to Yosemite, Glacier National Park for our 
engagement, Northern California coast for our wedding, Death Valley for the 
big bloom, and the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Canada. Where shall we 
go next to experience and savor 360 degrees of natural beauty? 
Author’s Acknowledgments
Every conversation I have about the green economy, whether with a Green 
Career Central member, a green career colleague, a career counselor, a work­
shop participant, or a member of the media, inspires me to continue clarify­
ing the unfolding green economy. I’m honored to have the opportunity.
My acquisitions editor, Lindsay Lefevere, had impeccable timing! I started 
writing soon after the 2009 stimulus package was enacted. Thanks go to my 
agent, Carol Susan Roth, and Marty Nemko for the roles they played as well.
I thoroughly enjoyed working with Corbin Collins, my Wiley project editor, 
and Jeana Wirtenberg, our technical editor, to create the book you now hold. 
I’m indebted to Rebecca Kieler, Richard Hewitt, Christine Hertzog and Lauren 
Delp for their contributions. A huge thank you goes to the Wiley team for 
work in transforming my manuscript into a book in the marketplace.
So many names, so little space! I’m incredibly grateful to my team for keep­
ing Green Career Central growing while I wrote: Susan Sullivan, Tessa Valle, 
Donna Gunter, Angela Giffin, Lauren Delp, Ellen Silva, and Kent Fields. I’m 
also blessed by colleagues and friends who have offered compelling ideas 
and heartfelt support since the early days of Green Career Central: Lauren 
Sullivan, Susan Reid, Kristi Breisch, Cheryl Esposito, Samantha Hartley, 
Laurie Taylor, Lisa Morrison, Karin Marcus, Lynn Strand Marks, Linda 
Lenore, Janice Summers, Mudge Kennedy, and Mitch Slomiak.
Kent and I started dating the week I signed my first For Dummies deal, so he’s 
a veteran. I so appreciate his dedication to keeping me at the top of my game 
while also tending to our household, our young goldendoodle, Aspen, and 
tasks associated with our business. I’m incredibly grateful. I love you!

Introduction
W
elcome to Green Careers For Dummies! You’ve probably seen news 
reports that a wave of green jobs is coming. This trend is drawing 
you to explore whether the green economy has something to offer you.
Whether you’re committed to finding a career that will have a positive impact 
on the planet or you see that there’s ample opportunity to make a difference 
in your own pocketbook, you’re ready to discover what it takes to land a job 
in this new economy. You’ll be happy to know that there are plenty of ways 
to make a good living while doing your part to help the Earth.
By picking up this book, you are already an early adopter, a pioneer at an 
exciting time in history. The cornerstones of the green economy are still 
being put in place. Key policies, funding, and technological advances are 
unfolding and will continue to do so for some time. It’s too early to know 
exactly what these change will mean to our world and the economy in the 
years ahead. 
The green economy is in its infancy and growing fast. Not everything is 
known yet. What we do know may be obsolete if new technologies or policies 
are put in place. To succeed in this transformative environment, you must 
be comfortable with an evolving unknown, changing conditions, and moving 
beyond the status quo to find innovative ways to do what needs to be done. 
The practical suggestions and tactics I give you throughout this book work as 
long as you put them to work. To make the most of these strategies, you need 
to take what I give you and figure out the best way to apply it to your target 
industry and your local area. If you do that, you will tap into the opportuni­
ties that are best for you. One glimmer of insight leads to a new connection 
that opens a door you didn’t even know existed. 
About This Book
If you’ve been paying any attention to the media, you know the green 
economy has gotten a fair amount of press since President Obama took 
office in early 2009. Talk of the power of the green economy to bring jobs 
back to America had a dreamlike quality there for a while. It seemed the green 
economy was going to cure all ills from the tanking economy to the overtaxed 
environment, saving us from high-priced fuel and bolstering national security. 

2
Green Careers For Dummies 
A solid, well-thought-out transition to a clean, non-carbon based economy 
will likely put more people to work, help the environment, and protect us 
from high-priced fuel — over time. Reporting about stimulus money made it 
sound like it would be an overnight transformation, when in fact that money 
is planned to be distributed through 2012. If you are looking for a magic 
bullet, a quick fix, or a crystal ball, you’ve found the wrong book. 
I can tell you that my team and I have been studying the green economy from 
the moment I launched my green career business in March of 2007. We scan 
our sources every day to discover what we can about developing trends and 
opportunities. In this book, my job is to give you the straight scoop, as I know 
it today. By the time you read the pages I’ve written, some factors may have 
changed. You need to keep that in mind and use the strategies I show you to 
build your own knowledge of your target field. 
Keep in mind that there is always some risk involved. I can’t promise you that 
your career path will always be straight and clear. What I can predict is that 
your search for your green career is going to be a roller coaster ride like no 
other. It’s likely to be both exhilarating and a bit hair-raising at times.
Are you up for the challenge? If so, enjoy the ride!
Conventions Used in This Book
To make this book as usable as possible, I use the following conventions. 
	
✓	Italics are used to emphasize important terms and to illustrate keywords 
you can use in Web searches. 
	
✓	Boldface words and phrases in bulleted lists and numbered steps help 
you pick out the keywords at a glance. 
	
✓	All Web addresses are in a special monofont typeface. Often the link I 
provide is only one page of a very interesting Web site. When you find 
something that grabs your attention, take your time exploring the entire 
site for other information that may be of interest to you.
	
	In my search for resources and information to help you understand the 
green economy, I found a lot of very long Web addresses. Often they are 
so long they run longer than the width of this page. When you find one 
of these Web addresses, just ignore the break in the text when you enter 
the address in your Web browser.
	
✓	When I use the word companies in this book, I’m really referring to any 
kind of organization you might want to work for. You may see yourself 
working for a public or private company or you might prefer to work 
for a government agency, a nonprofit, an educational institution, a small 
business, or a consulting firm. Although green job opportunities are 

3
 Introduction
available in all these settings, it would be cumbersome to refer to all of 
them every time. And besides, if it’s really going to be a green economy, 
there are going to have to be a lot of companies in it. 
What You’re Not to Read
Whether you’re currently employed and exploring your green career options 
or need to find a job now, chances are you don’t have a lot of time. If you 
need to skip over sections of the book, here’s what I suggest you jump over. 
	
✓	Sidebars provide descriptions of concepts unique to the green economy 
and industries that are just beginning to gain traction. These sections 
are shaded in gray and stand apart from the text. 
	
✓	The industry profiles in Chapters 7 through 13 are meant to be scanned 
for relevance. If the topic isn’t interesting to you, feel free to skip it. 
	
✓	If you aren’t employed at the moment, you can leap right over Chapters 20 
and 22 that help you take your green career to the next level or help you 
green your current job. 
Foolish Assumptions
Now that you are reading this book, I assume
	
✓	You want a green career. You may be moving in this direction because you’re 
concerned about the state of the environment or because you recognize 
the green economy is the next big wave of economic growth. Either way, 
you are a player in this unfolding story that is going to color our future 
for some time to come.
	
✓	You’re committed to making a difference in your pocketbook. Sure, 
changing the world is a great goal. I assure you that this book describes 
real career options that pay.
	
✓	You’re not attached to the status quo. You’re ready for change in your 
professional life and the world.
	
✓	You have an inquiring mind. You want to discover more about what you 
don’t know. You’re reading this book to expand your thinking about 
your career options and the green economy.
	
✓	You’re willing to put some legwork and elbow grease into your own job 
search. As much as I’d like to, I can’t give you your green career on a 
silver platter. I give you all the tips and shortcuts I know of, but you’ve 
got to take the initiative to put them to work.

Green Careers For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
The chapters in this book are organized into six parts.
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier
The green economy is a broad, far-ranging sea of opportunity. You have to 
figure out what you’re getting into, gain a sense of the factors shaping the 
green economy, and understand why the green economy is still a work in 
progress. Grasping the unique features of the new economy provides you 
with new insights about the possibilities for you. The chapters here help you 
discover where the opportunities are within the green economy. Better yet, 
you can find out what’s available for someone with your education, back­
ground, and salary needs. Getting a sense of why it’s a bit challenging to find 
a green career helps you counteract these unknowns.
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus
The most effective way to shorten your path to your green career is to define 
the green focus that allows you to leverage your existing skills, experiences, 
and interests. When you know where you are heading, it’s far easier to know 
what actions you need to take to get there. These chapters get you to explore 
your interests. Not just within the green/sustainability arena, but in all 
areas of your life. You also take a look at your favorite skills. Claiming what 
you enjoy and do well gives you the building blocks for your future career. 
Finally, this part helps you pull together potential career ideas by combining 
your interests and skills in creative ways. By the end of this part you have an 
idea of your green career goal.
Part III: Exploring Careers 
in Green Industries
One of the most challenging aspects of the green economy is knowing what 
green careers actually exist. In this part you find seven chapters filled to the 
brim with profiles of the most advanced green industries. Scan the different 
industry categories in the table of contents to decide which chapters you’re 
most drawn to explore. Then review each industry profile to identify the 
industries you want to target. 
The industry profiles can serve as a starting point for your own research. 
Use the industry description and current and future trends to get a sense of

the industry. Then explore the associations, resources, and sample job 
functions to discover what you might want to do in the field. 
Part IV: Using Green Job 
Search 2.0 Techniques
Whether you launched your last job search a year ago or more than a decade 
ago, in this part you discover up-to-the minute strategies to structure your 
job search. Discover online and in-person methods for gaining valuable infor­
mation about your target industry and build a strong, responsive network. 
Explore the most effective ways to strengthen your knowledge and skills in 
the green/sustainability world. Bring all your discoveries together as you pre­
pare your resume to articulate your value to green employers.
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search
When you’re ready to launch your job search, here you can identify companies 
that match your green career goals and figure out how to find job openings in 
the evolving green economy. After you’ve landed your green career, use these 
chapters to find out strategies you can use to develop your green career over 
the long term. 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In a series of short and sweet tips, these two chapters offer a collection of 
green career resources you can use to move your job search forward. And 
while you’re searching for your next job, consider ways to green your current 
job as a way to bolster your resume for your next move.

T
he emerging green economy is this generation’s new 
frontier. Understanding the new economy opens up 
opportunities for a wide range of professions. In this part 
you discover the factors that shape the green economy 
and what jobs qualify as green. Find out what it takes to 
thrive within the new economy and what mindset you 
need to hold to find your place in the green economy.

▶	Discovering tactics you can use to find a green position
T
his is a very exciting time. We’re in the earliest stages of a new economic 
era, and the first paths into this future are just beginning to be defined. 
Many more paths will emerge as new industries take form over time. To risk 
a metaphor, it’s a bit like the Old West, with nascent opportunities beckoning 
those with the courage to strike out for them. Think of yourself as a pioneer 
in the first wave of many who will take this journey. As with any frontier situ­
ation, you must keep your wits about you as you find the right path through 
uncertainty to your chosen destination.
Transforming business-as-usual into a new green/clean/sustainable economy is 
likely to take decades, as new technologies are invented, tested, and adopted, 
as new policies are shaped and implemented, and as new behaviors become 
second nature. Each new element of the economy will become a stepping stone 
for the next level of innovation, just as the inventions of textile machines, 
steam engines, and ironmaking techniques led to a series of innovations 
during the Industrial Revolution. The economic landscape of the green future 
will be defined and shaped by the goals and actions put in place now that can 
turn our unsustainable way of life into a sustainable one.
Welcome, then, to the new Wild West of the career world. To understand why 
this world is different from the one you’re familiar with, let’s look at where 
we’ve been and how we got to where we are.

10
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
Taking a Step Back in Time
The Industrial Revolution brought incredible progress with an amazing number 
of breakthrough inventions, mechanized production methods, more-effective 
transportation methods, and newfangled contraptions. If you scan the inven­
tions that have come on the scene since the Industrial Revolution, you notice 
that our lives have been forever changed by the advent of consumer goods, 
synthetic materials such as plastics and polyester, and electronic 
gadgets. Progress! 
What we didn’t know at the time, and haven’t known for certain until recently, 
is that the factories that manufactured all the stuff we’ve come to love and 
need were also spewing out more human-generated carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse gases in a shorter span of time than the planet had ever seen 
before. These emissions have created an unintended problem for our entire 
planet. With more emissions in the atmosphere, more solar heat is trapped, 
creating slowly rising global temperatures. (For more details on global 
warming, see Chapter 2.)
Looking back, we can also see that the Industrial Revolution set us on a path 
of pulling a tremendous amount of minerals, materials, and natural resources 
from our surrounding environment. Over time the United States and other 
industrialized countries turned to importing resources from other countries 
without regard to how our harvesting impacted the natural systems of their 
country or ours. 
The modern economy’s fuel habit is another part of the problem. We’ve grown 
accustomed to using as much fuel as we need to live very cushy lifestyles. In 
fact, the Center for Environment and Population (www.cepnet.org) notes in 
its recent U.S. Population Energy and Climate Change Report, that “while the 
U.S. represents about 5% of the global population, it consumes about 25% of 
the world’s energy, and generates 5 times the world average of CO2 emissions.”
Where does this leave us? With the unpleasant knowledge that our lifestyle 
is utterly unsustainable. If we continue living the way we’ve been living, we’ll 
run out of oil, forests, animals, and land at some point in the future. You 
might not live to see that day, but your kids and their kids might. 
Thomas Friedman, in his book Hot, Flat, and Crowded, notes that the world’s 
population is growing dramatically (the crowded part), with a larger and 
larger percentage of people around the world making enough money to strive 
for a decidedly American lifestyle (flat), in a world that’s been heating up 
since the Industrial Revolution (hot). 
It all adds up to a serious problem. 

11
 Chapter 1: The New World of Green Careers
Understanding the Green/Clean/ 
Sustainable Economy
We’re now being called upon to take bold new actions to solve this problem 
that has the potential to cause catastrophic harm. The good news is that we 
have the technology and know-how to solve this problem. What we seem to 
lack is the political and personal will to make the necessary changes to bring 
our world back into a sustainable balance. 
As this book outlines, innovative thinking and groundbreaking actions are 
occurring right now in many of the industries we depend on. Of course, the 
transformation we’re likely to experience is not going to take us back to the 
lifestyles of past centuries. Instead, innovations will move us forward to a 
new way of living that has a much lighter footprint (impact) on the planet. 
Before we proceed, let’s take a look at a few key terms:
	
✓	Green: You’ve no doubt noticed that it’s a word that gets thrown around 
a lot by the media, activists, and politicians. With the exception of com­
panies that are green-washing (leading you to believe that their product 
or service is beneficial to the planet even though it’s not), the people 
committed to solving this problem use green as shorthand for something 
that improves the state of the environment in a discernable way. It might 
refer to a product, industry, company, job, process, or organization that 
conserves energy and resources, generates clean, renewable energy, 
minimizes waste, eliminates hazardous materials, or restores the envi­
ronment and biodiversity.
	
	As new trends take hold, it’s common for words to evolve quickly and 
fluidly, so keep these things in mind:
 
• No industry, company, or job is 100 percent green, though some 
are making impressive strides in the right direction. Making 
anything greener is a process that occurs over time. 
 
• Some companies or initiatives may be described as light green 
(more casual, cursory, and surface attempts) or dark green (very 
serious, dedicated, and taking real action).
 
• Look not only at the final product, but delve into its entire life cycle. 
We must review the materials and processes that went into creating 
the product, how the product is used, and how it’s disposed of at 
the end of its life.
 
• Our definition of green will evolve with new technology and regu­
lations. As the definition becomes more stringent, the bar will be 
raised, motivating us to push for better results. 

12
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
 
• As green ways become integrated and common, it’s likely that the 
term green will fade away. Right now the term distinguishes new 
innovation from traditional ways. When green policies are standard, 
we won’t need to call attention to them.
	
✓	Clean: Products, processes, and services that depend on renewable 
energy sources, minimize waste, and use natural resources judiciously 
are deemed to be clean. You’ll often hear this term used to refer to 
clean energy or cleantech. If you look at the fine print on some cleantech 
Web sites you may find emphatic declarations that they are not green. 
Apparently they are attempting to distance themselves from a previous 
iteration of green, when green groups focused on advocacy or addressed 
issues of pollution control. Times have changed.
	
✓	Sustainable: Humans in industrialized cultures tend to live in ways that 
are unsustainable. In other words, we take far more from the Earththan 
it can regenerate in a reasonable amount of time. As a result, we’re making 
it harder for future generations to have the same standard of living. To 
become sustainable we need to change our ways: We must find energy 
sources that are naturally renewable and create effective ways to handle 
our own waste so we don’t foul the planet. One way to become sustain­
able is the triple bottom line approach — attending to the economic and 
social and environmental impacts of our choices.
In this book I use all three terms because the situation calls for all three. That 
said, it’s not always feasible to include all three terms in every discussion. I 
may also use the word green as shorthand for the multi-faceted concepts that 
create green, clean, and sustainable ways of doing business. 
The green economy refers to the industries that are producing greener products, 
using cleaner processes, and offering more sustainable services in an effort 
to move us toward a new standard. Some industries are farther along the 
trail than others. You’ll be amazed at the activity in this new economy that 
some experts are already calling the New Industrial Revolution (http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Industrial_Revolution).
Thar’s Green in Them Thar Hills
Are you depressed now? Does all that sound hopeless and impossible? Well, 
recall that the United States was built by people who took risks during 
challenging times under seemingly impossible circumstances. 
	
✓	Colonists crossed oceans to settle in a land of opportunity.
	
✓	Pioneers traversed the plains and clamored over mountain ranges to 
reach the West Coast for the promise of gold.

 Chapter 1: The New World of Green Careers
	
✓	Inventors and businesses transformed the economic landscape by 
implementing innovations to create the industrial revolution.
	
✓	In just 15 years people overcame the incredible hardships of the Great 
Depression and won World War II.
	
✓	In less than a decade scientists set and reached the unbelievable goal of 
putting a man on the moon.
	
✓	The Internet, a geeky obscurity just 20 years ago, has completely 
transformed how we all do business, communicate, and live.
Innovative thinking has always led us to achieve amazing goals, reap astound­
ing profits, and gain personal satisfaction and fulfillment along the way. Just 
as in previous eras, the opportunities that accompany our huge challenges 
are enormous, the innovations are inspiring, and the potential benefits are 
incredible.
Clarifying Your Place in 
the Green Economy
The transition from where we are now to where we need to be will require a 
large number of people playing a variety of roles. There are so many oppor­
tunities in this transformative process that it’s impossible to track them all. 
The green economy experts I know say that tracking the entire green economy 
is like drinking from a fire hose.
To find your green career, you have to identify where your skills fit early in 
your quest. Although it may feel as though it’s adding time to your journey, 
knowing your focus actually shortens your path to your green career. With 
a clear vision of your target industry and profession, you have a rudder you 
can use to steer your actions as you prepare for your job search. You’ll know 
what information to read, what meetings to attend, what training to obtain, 
and who to contact to discover more about your chosen green career. Having 
this clarity saves you time, frustration, and missed opportunities.
	
Use the steps outlined in Chapters 4 through 6 to review your interests and 
skills from various parts of your life. That helps you identify the best way to 
apply your talents in the green economy. Don’t worry if you aren’t sure what’s 
possible — you’ll find a collection of industry profiles to explore to help you 
identify the industries that are likely to be the best fit for you.

14
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
Opportunities Are Everywhere
Some industries that contribute to the green economy are obvious: Renewable 
energy, green building, ecotourism, and natural resources are no doubt 
industries you’ve heard of. Others are not so obvious. In fact, I’ve made new 
green industry discoveries just while researching this book:
	
✓	Green ports
	
✓	Environmental education
	
✓	Waste-to-energy
	
✓	Green medical practice
	
✓	Organic/green textiles and fashion
The green industries that are likely to have the most impact are those that touch 
the parts of our lives that are so familiar to us that we take them for granted. 
	
✓	Look at electricity. As you live now, you probably don’t know exactly 
where your electricity comes from, how it was generated, or how it 
reaches your house to power your appliances. All you know is that when 
you flip that switch you have power. As our electric grid is redesigned 
and smart components are added that enable us to assess our power 
usage in real time, we’ll develop a more conscious relationship with the 
power we use at home and at work. We’ll know how much power we are 
using and which appliances are costing us the most money. With this 
knowledge we’ll be in a much better position to conserve energy and 
save money.
	
✓	Another example is how we handle waste. When you put your trash on 
the curb, it disappears, never to be thought of again. In actuality, trash 
is taking up more and more landfill and polluting our world with toxins 
and materials that don’t biodegrade. What we know about waste and 
how we handle it is likely to change dramatically as we move to a more 
sustainable world. New innovations will transform packaging to reduce 
waste at the front end, while new technologies will allow us to reuse and 
recycle more and more of the products we use at home and at work.
To grasp the range of industries that are becoming more sustainable and 
green, scan the industry profiles in Chapters 7 through 13. 
	
The green economy is changing quickly. For nearly half the industries I 
researched, I found key announcements that had been made within the pre­
vious week or month. Even with the final last-minute check on the status of 
fast-changing industries, I know that the minute I turn in my final manuscript, 
the green economy will continue moving forward. It’s the nature of the beast! 
But don’t worry, I’ve got you covered. My Web site, Green Career Central, has 

15
 Chapter 1: The New World of Green Careers
been tracking industry developments since this book was published. Visit 
www.greencareercentral.com/updates to discover what continues to 
unfold in your target industry. 
Taking the Initiative: It’s Up to You
Although every career change and job search takes commitment and dedica­
tion, finding a green career takes a bit more initiative. Given that the green 
economy is just now forming, the tools you may be accustomed to using for a 
job search may not be very effective. The resources you use to research your 
target industry may not have any information about cutting-edge industries, 
companies, and jobs. Your usual networking methods may not produce the 
leads you need.
The tactics included in this book give you insider tips to help you move your 
green job search forward faster. Although plugging into the resources I discuss 
gives you advantages other green job seekers may not have, it’s impossible 
to predict exactly how long your job search will take. Your journey will 
depend on how your target industry is developing, as well as your target 
position and how many other people are searching for that job. 
The key to success is starting your preparations for your green career as 
soon as possible, even while you’re working in the traditional economy. The 
deeper your network, the more you know about your target industry; and 
the better you’ve developed your skills, the more likely you are to attract the 
attention of those who will hire you. 
Finding Green Job Opportunities
Finding job openings in any economy is challenging. Within the green 
economy you have a few more challenges that can hinder your progress.
	
The first thing you must know about finding potential green job openings is 
that, just like in the traditional economy, the vast majority of the jobs are not 
posted on job boards or even on company Web sites. Sorry. I know that makes it 
harder, but it’s true. It’s up to you to ferret them out. 
The people in your target green industry are the ones you need to connect 
with to hear about job openings. They also know the inside story of what’s 
happening in various green companies. Having a strong green network and 
being in close contact with those in your network are the most effective ways 
to find potential green opportunities. Chapter 15 spells out the best ways to 
build your green network. 

16
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
To make the most of your network connections, you must be able to articulate 
in crystal clear terms what kind of position you are looking for. Your network 
can’t help you if you haven’t figured it out or you don’t know how to describe 
it so others understand you. (For tips on this, see Chapter 17.)
If you can tell your contacts about the companies you’re targeting, all the 
better — but how do you know which companies to target? Unfortunately, at 
this early stage, there aren’t many lists of green companies you can count on. 
If you do find a list with the top companies in a particular industry, bookmark 
it, print it out, tape it to your fridge, and use it as a starting point for your 
own research.
Three factors make finding green jobs challenging (for tactics to help you 
counteract these challenges, check out Chapter 18):
	
✓	Most likely you want to work in a company in a particular geographic 
area. You aren’t interested in just any solar company — you want to 
work in one in your city or another city you’ve already targeted.
	
✓	You also need to discern whether the companies that look appealing to 
you hire people with your skills and talents. You need some way to get 
inside these companies to understand them.
	
✓	You also need to determine whether the companies are green/clean/
sustainable. Not easy to do, but there are ways. 
The Green Economy Is Your Oyster
There is — or will be — a place in the green economy for everyone. Your 
skills, passions, talents, and education make you uniquely suited to fill a 
particular position. The trick is finding it. This book gives you the information 
and resources you need to find your place in the green economy.
If you don’t see a place to apply your skills right now, don’t despair. New 
positions are evolving as new technologies emerge, policies are enacted, and 
goals are defined. While you wait for the perfect fit, continue to build your 
network, develop your talents, and track movements within your target green 
industry. Consider applying what you discover to your current position or 
taking an active role in moving your industry into the new sustainable age. 
Ultimately, the opportunities of the green economy are going to be what you 
make of them. It’s up to you to find what part you’ll play in designing and 
implementing a green, clean, sustainable world.

n a well-known parable from India, blind men are asked to examine an 
elephant and report their findings. The man who was at the tail describes 
a rope, the man at the trunk recalls a snake, the man who felt the tusk is 
reminded of a spear, the ones at the legs report a treelike being, and so on. 
The green economy is like the elephant. As each specialist, politician, busi­
ness owner, and worker scans their part of the new economy, they develop a 
picture based on their experience. Because the green economy is a huge, ever-
changing, amorphous form at the moment, it’s nearly impossible for any one 
individual to make a thorough, accurate assessment of it. (That includes me, 
though I use examples from a wide range of experts and companies throughout 
the book to try to weave together a picture of the green economy for you.) 
In truth, the green economy is the sum of many people’s impressions. 
Everyone must contribute knowledge and experience to unlock the best way 
to move toward an economy that treads lightly on the environment. To par­
ticipate in defining the problem and searching for the solution, you must gain 
a solid understanding of why climate change is spurring on the move to a 
new economy, how the green economy is being formed, and why it’s different 
from the traditional economy.
	
As you consider the issues in this chapter, don’t get bogged down in the mag­
nitude of the problem. Instead, keep your eye out for areas where you may 
be able to use your talents and skills to be part of the solution. The clues you 
gather about your interests and skills will help you define your green career 
focus in Chapters 4 through 6.

Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
Making Sense of Climate Change
By now you have no doubt heard of climate change. You may have read 
about the subject in detail (if so, you can skip to the next heading) or you 
may just know vaguely that it’s bad without fully understanding the problem 
and its ramifications. Use this very short explanation to get up to speed.
Scientific definition
As the Earth receives light from the sun, it absorbs that energy and converts 
it into heat. The gases in our atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, 
nitrous oxide, and ozone, hold that heat in, much as a greenhouse retains 
heat. Scientists have known about this naturally occurring effect since 1824 
when Joseph Fourier discovered that our temperatures would be a lot cooler 
if we didn’t have the atmospheric layer surrounding our planet. 
So far, so good. The problem is that the carbon dioxide emitted during the 
Industrial Revolution of the 19th and 20th centuries has changed the quality 
of our atmosphere such that it holds more of the sun’s heat in than it used to. 
Although scientific finding do show fluctuations in the Earth’s temperatures 
throughout its history, those changes generally take place over thousands of 
years rather than tens of years. For more details, visit http://environment.
nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming.
Skeptics and deniers
There are those who have questions and 
doubts about the scientific evidence regarding 
global warming and climate change. Deniers 
flat out deny the data regarding climate change. 
Skeptics are scientists who have reviewed the 
data and have questions about the conclusions. 
Generally speaking, there are two issues that 
attract attention: 
	✓	Are temperatures really rising?
	✓	If so, are the increasing temperatures the 
result of human activity?
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change was founded to review published 
scientific literature throughout the world to 
ascertain the impact of climate change. In 
its most recent report released in 2007, the 
IPCC’s work group on the scientific basis of 
global warming (www.ipcc.ch) concluded 
that, “Global atmospheric concentrations of 
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide 
have increased markedly as a result of human 
activities since 1750 and now far exceed pre-
industrial values determined from ice cores 
spanning many thousands of years. The global 
increases in carbon dioxide concentration are 
due primarily to fossil fuel use and land use 
change, while those of methane and nitrous 
oxide are primarily due to agriculture.” 

19
 Chapter 2: Inside the Green Economy
Environmental ramifications
If average temperatures on the planet rise, even by a degree or two, that’s 
enough to shift weather patterns around the globe. Some regions become 
warmer, and others become cooler. Some areas receive more precipitation 
and others less. As glacial ice melts due to hotter temperatures in the moun­
tains and the poles, sea levels are likely to rise, threatening coastal areas 
where a large part of Earth’s population lives. 
Because the Earth is a natural system, even a seemingly subtle climate 
change has the potential to trigger a domino effect. For instance, if animals 
can no longer find food in their traditional range, they search for a new place 
to live. They may need to adjust their eating habits to fit their new range. As a 
result of these seemingly innocuous changes, the ecosystem in their original 
range begins to change as does the balance in their new range. 
If these changes occur over a period of thousands of years, the animals adapt 
over a number of generations (or in the end never adapt). Unfortunately the 
climate changes we are experiencing now are happening far too quickly for many 
animals to even have a chance at adapting. As a result, extinctions are likely to 
follow. To get a glimpse of how climate change will influence the rate of extinc­
tions, read http://news.mongabay.com/2007/0326-extinction.html.
If you think climate change is some far-off, abstract effect, think again. Rising 
temperatures are already impacting our world in visible ways. Take a look 
at the interactive map by National Geographic to get a sense of the range of 
changes we may experience on our planet: http://environment.national
geographic.com/environment/global-warming/gw-impacts-
interactive.html.
Economic impact
As increasing temperatures impact the natural environment, we can also 
expect to see disruptions in our economic world as well. The Center for 
Integrative Environmental Research (www.cier.umd.edu/climate
adaptation) conducts regional research on the economic impact of climate 
change and the costs of inaction. Based on its findings, it’s clear that we will 
feel the impact on the economy itself, on the infrastructure we are accus­
tomed to, and on the natural resources we depend on for food, water, food, 
and building materials.

Although forecasts like these are never very pleasant to read or consider, know­
ing the problems facing your region can help you see potential ways you can 
make a difference in your community. Go to www.cier.umd.edu/climate
adaptation and scroll down to the map. From there, click on a region to 
access a concise, easy-to-read two-page report on the economic impact of cli­
mate change in that region.
Political fallout
As natural resources become scarce, crops fail, and natural disasters take 
their toll on various regions of the world, nations have two options: Work 
together to find solutions to pressing problems or develop strained relation­
ships that make it difficult to collaborate.
Factions in the U.S. are already focusing on preserving traditional industries 
and resources. Although this strategy may have a short-term payoff, continu­
ing to invest in technologies and resources that cannot take us into the new, 
clean economy isn’t going to pay off in the long run. Some politicians, deci­
sion makers, and business owners continue to deny that climate change is 
worth worrying about. 
Just as previous revolutions (the Internet) and economic shifts (the Great 
Depression) needed an extra boost from the government in the form of fund­
ing, incentives, and projects, the green economy will more likely take root 
and build a strong foundation with similar kinds of support. 
Global solutions
Climate change is not just happening in one country or one region. It’s hap­
pening around the world. Every village and neighborhood is going to feel 
the impact now or in the future. 
To succeed in turning the tide, we must approach climate change with a global 
focus. Solutions must be based on cooperation, collaboration, and the pollina­
tion of ideas. There’s no time for each region or town to re-create or build solu­
tions from scratch. When people find something that works, they must share 
that far and wide so others can reap the same benefits in their local area.
	
The United Nations Environment Programme’s Green Economy Initiative is 
paving the way for collaboration through three projects: a green jobs report 
on global employment trends, an economic valuation of ecological services 
and biodiversity to demonstrate how critical it is to nurture biodiversity 
throughout the world, and a green economy report to show how policymaking 
can move the green economy forward worldwide. For more details, see www.
unep.org/greeneconomy.

21
 Chapter 2: Inside the Green Economy
The Green Economy Is a Work in Progress
The move to a green economy was born out of the need to reduce global 
warming by decreasing the amount of greenhouse gases we are emitting into 
the atmosphere. Among those who believe climate change is real, there’s 
general agreement that people must make changes in the way they live and 
do business. Experts say that we must transition from a carbon-based econ­
omy to one based on clean, renewable energy, but there’s little consensus as 
to the best strategies to achieve that goal. 
There seem to be more good questions than solid answers: What are the 
steps we need to take? Which steps should come first? How long will it take? 
What will give us the biggest reduction of greenhouse gases for the invest­
ment? How much should the government be involved? What’s the best to way 
to spur this transition to the new economy? The list goes on and on.
	
Although media reports may have you wondering why the green economy 
isn’t in full swing yet, the reality is that the cornerstones of the green economy 
are still being put in place. As each feature of the green economy is defined, 
the business community becomes clearer about the actions it can take to 
receive a return on investment. Knowing the rules of the road enables compa­
nies to be willing to invest in what will be in demand in the green economy.
As it stands now, the green economy is constantly evolving. Each of the fol­
lowing sections discusses a factor that has the potential to change the defini­
tion of the green economy. By tracking these factors yourself, you’ll be able 
to watch as the defining features of the green economy continue to unfold.
Goals and mandates
One of the most effective ways to change behavior is to create policies and 
regulations that encourage green actions and discourage actions that are 
inconsistent with the goals of the green economy. Over the years some local 
governments and states have put policies and regulations in place to move 
their regions in a green direction. The result has been a patchwork of poli­
cies that has made it difficult for the business community to fully embrace 
the stated goals and act. With the new Obama Administration, a more nation­
ally focused set of policies and regulations are under discussion. Although 
details are not all nailed down, it is clear that the administration intends to 
encourage investments, innovations, and business development in the green 
economy. Only time will tell exactly what all the key policies will look like. 
	
In May 2009, the White House announced a new National Fuel Efficiency Policy 
that requires automobile manufacturers to produce vehicles that have “an 
average fuel economy standard of 35.5 mpg by 2016.” The details of the policy 

22
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
outline various milestones for model years between 2012 and 2016. With 
this policy in place, auto manufacturers now know exactly what’s expected 
of them. For more details about this policy read the press release, www.
whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-
National-Fuel-Efficiency-Policy.
	
One potential policy to watch for is a National Renewable Energy Standard. 
Currently more than half the states in the U.S. have a policy that encourages 
or mandates electricity companies to include a certain percentage of their 
electricity from renewable energy sources (see page 8 of www.nrel.gov/
docs/fy08osti/41409.pdf). This kind of policy opens up opportunities 
for renewable energy companies because investors can fund these companies 
knowing that there is a built-in customer base waiting for the power produced. 
A national standard would do even more to open up this market. 
Incentives and disincentives
Some laws put incentives and disincentives in place to influence the behav­
iors of consumers, businesses, or investors. Implementing the right incentive 
program can literally create a marketplace overnight. 
But what goes up often comes down. When existing incentive programs 
expire after a designated period of time, industries may falter as their guar­
anteed customer base vanishes. The hope is that the corresponding industry 
has reached a level of stability so that the expiration doesn’t cause the indus­
try to contract. 
	
In the past, the wind industry has depended on a production tax credit (PTC) 
as a vehicle to encourage investors to provide capital for new installations. 
Unfortunately, the PTC system was often in place for a year and then it would 
expire. Then it would be reinstated again and expire again. Without a reliable 
tax credit, investors won’t invest because they don’t have a guaranteed return 
through the tax credit system. This graph tells the story even more clearly: 
www.ucsusa.org/assets/images/ce/AWEA-wind-capacity-graph.
png. When tax credits are extended, the industry flourishes, but the minute 
those tax credits lapse, there’s been serious trouble for the wind industry. 
Thankfully, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 extended 
the current PTC through 2012. 
	
A couple of programs to watch as they work their way through the national 
or local political system include the cap and trade system to encourage com­
panies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions (www.epa.gov/captrade) 
and a solar feed-in tariff to motivate home owners to install solar panels so 
they can sell their extra energy to their local utility (http://earth2tech.
com/2009/03/02/florida-utility-kicks-off-solar-feed-in-
tariff-a-first-for-the-us/). Both of these programs, if put in place, 
have the potential to stimulate the green economy.

23
 Chapter 2: Inside the Green Economy
Treaties and agreements
In 1997, a number of industrialized nations came together to agree to reduce 
six greenhouse gases in the Kyoto Protocol, an addition to the United Nations 
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), an international treaty 
originally signed by 192 countries in 1994. Although the United States signed 
the Kyoto Protocol, it was never ratified by the Senate, so the U.S. is not 
legally bound by the agreement. In 2005 the Kyoto Protocol was officially put 
in place for the more than 140 other countries who had ratified it. 
Nevertheless, the Kyoto Protocol has continued to play a part in forming 
the green economy through the world. Under President George W. Bush, the 
United States chose to address the problem independently through volun­
tary measures that would reduce the greenhouse gas intensity, which is the 
“ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to economic output.” Although this is not 
the same as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, it was the step the Bush 
Administration was willing to commit to. For a full description of the Kyoto 
Protocol process and U.S. policy, check out this entry on the Encyclopedia 
of Earth: www.eoearth.org/article/Kyoto_Protocol_and_the_
United_States.
	
When Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle, Washington, realized that the United 
States was not on board with the Kyoto Protocol, he created the U.S. 
Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, which enabled mayors 
to commit to the same Kyoto reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for their 
cities. As of 2009, more than 1,000 mayors had signed the agreement and used 
it to guide their actions locally. For more information and to see whether your 
mayor has signed, visit http://usmayors.org/climateprotection/
agreement.htm.
By the time this book is published, another meeting will have been held in 
Copenhagen to figure out what to do when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 
2012. As I write this section, it’s clear that it’s too early in the pre-treaty dis­
cussions to predict what strategy the Obama Administration will take on the 
world stage. For more on this meeting, take a look at http://en.cop15.dk.
Research funding
With the green economy comes the need for new innovations and new knowl­
edge. As you’ve no doubt noticed, a number of interlocking problems need 
exploration and out-of-the-box thinking. Unfortunately, research, thinking, 
and innovation requires quite a bit of funding — that is, money. Most univer­
sities, think tanks, and research labs have been stretched in recent years by 
decreasing funding and tight budgets. 

24
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
	
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided a much needed boon 
for many research facilities around the country. Entering research into the 
search field on www.recovery.gov yields many announcements on research 
funding. The following are three that I found. If you try it, you’re likely to find 
even more announcements by the time this book is published. 
	
✓	The National Science Foundation committed $300 million dollars to 
research instrumentation and $200 million for repairs and renovations of 
academic research facilities.
	
✓	The Department of Energy is providing more than $786.5 million to fund 
biofuel research and development and a demonstration biorefinery and 
$2.4 billion to explore carbon capture and storage technology.
	
✓	The Department of Interior is dedicating $140 million to over 300 
projects at the U.S. Geological Survey. 
Capital investments
Money makes the world go around. Start-up companies need money. Period. 
Without funds, companies promoting innovations that could change the world 
can fail quickly. Funds for the green economy come from three main sources:
	
✓	Venture capitalists continue to fund green companies. Investment trends 
are a good way to see how and where the green economy is growing. See 
the list of blogs on www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/greencareers 
for ones that track investments in key green industries. 
	
✓	Large capitalized companies, such as Google, GE, IBM, and Cisco 
Systems, are moving into the green space by investing in other compa­
nies or partnering with other companies on joint projects.
	
✓	Contracts, grants, and loans from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
 Act funds are also proving to be a welcome revenue source through 2012. 
Companies that fit the criteria announced by various governmental 
agencies may be in a good position to receive funding for certain kinds 
of projects. For a map of funds see www.recovery.gov.
Innovations
Although climate change is unlikely to be reversed through innovation alone, 
technological advances are likely to play a significant role in determining 
how the green economy develops over time. As new technologies come on 
the scene, don’t be surprised if they knock previous technological darlings 
off the map. It’s entirely possible that innovations within emerging industries 
such as algae biofuels, cellulosic biofuels, and lithium ion batteries could 
change the future by opening up new avenues for even further development.

25
 Chapter 2: Inside the Green Economy
	
The smart grid, an emerging sector, has the potential to transform how elec­
tricity and information are handled from power generation, transmission, and 
distribution to energy storage and real-time energy management technology. 
The Gridwise Alliance (www.gridwise.org) believes that developments in 
this sector are likely to spawn entirely new industries yet to be imagined. See 
Chapter 10 for more information about the smart grid. 
Scientific findings
Watching An Inconvenient Truth was the first time many people thought about 
global warming. By putting scientific findings in engaging contexts, Al Gore 
woke many up to the issues. Unfortunately, knowing about global warming 
isn’t enough. We must continue to turn to scientific findings to assess the 
current impact on the planet and to forecast how higher temperatures, shifts 
in ecosystems, and higher sea levels will impact our lives. 
Unique Qualities of the Green Economy
Although the form of the green economy is still being shaped and defined, 
early adopters are already showing how that economy may look. Over the 
last two decades, innovative thinkers have shared new business strategies 
and philosophies that transform business-as-usual. By looking at these new 
business models, you can get a sense of how the green economy is going to 
differ from the traditional industrial economy we’ve had. 
	
Don’t worry about understanding every nuance of these new strategies. 
I cover them in more detail throughout the book and point you to other 
resources where you can dive into details when you’re ready. For now, focus 
on how changing our energy philosophy can have an impact on the planet.
Putting a value on natural resources 
For several centuries we’ve been taking resources from the planet without 
paying the bill. We use these resources — such as water, minerals, trees, and 
energy — without concern or consideration. We don’t recognize the role the 
natural environment plays in providing clean air, clean water, building mate­
rials, and a place to grow food. We take it for granted that those services will 
always be there. If we don’t acknowledge the value of these eco-services, we 
may find ourselves in a very compromised position in the near future.

Natural capitalism, a concept developed by Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and 
Hunter Lovins in their book by the same name, shows businesses the impor­
tance of incorporating the cost of natural resources when making business 
decisions. And by redesigning business processes by using inspiration from 
nature, resources can be used much more efficiently and economically. 
Shifting to sustainable business practices
Companies that take on a green philosophy shift the dynamic within the com­
pany. Suddenly, doing business is about more than making products to make 
money. It’s about using and valuing natural resources and human resources 
to create innovative ways of doing business that do no harm to the environ­
ment, the people who are touched by the company (such as employees, 
suppliers, customers, or neighbors), or the financial status of the company. 
This triple bottom line, as it is called, engages the workforce and the customer 
base in ways that stimulate creativity and innovation. 
One way to implement this approach to business is through sustainable busi­
ness practices, which means finding ways to do business that don’t compro­
mise future generations’ ability to live healthy, full lives on the planet. To 
accomplish sustainability goals, companies must look at all aspects of their 
business to discover new ways to generate power, identify eco-friendly raw 
materials, handle waste, and rethink transportation and distribution. 
	
Interface, Inc., manufactures carpet tiles under several brand names. In 1994, 
CEO Ray Anderson, had an insight that changed the course of his business. 
Determined to re-create the company with an eye toward sustainability, he 
and his employees spent the next 15 years transforming the processes, materi­
als, and systems of their business to reduce their impact on the environment. 
Interface strives to create a restorative company, one that gives back more 
to the environment than it takes. Read about it at www.interfaceglobal.
com/Sustainability/Our-Journey.aspx.
Rethinking manufacturing
For most of the industrial age manufacturing has been a linear process: take-
make-waste. Industry has had little regard for the planet as it extracts more 
materials to make more things. At the end of the cycle, we throw away those 
same things with no regard for where they go, their continued impact on the 
planet, or the fact that we are throwing away materials that still have value.
Several scientists in the 1990s discovered that there is no such thing as waste in 
nature. What decays in nature becomes food for the next cycle of life. Applying 
this concept to manufacturing, waste and used-up, unwanted products are 

27
 Chapter 2: Inside the Green Economy
revealed as resources that can be reused to create new products. Called the 
cradle to cradle process, this shift in thinking opens up a new cyclical form of 
manufacturing that minimizes the amount of raw materials we extract from 
the planet and the amount of discarded waste at the end. 
	
Companies who want to rely on cradle to cradle design concepts to produce 
products that are sustainably built can work with McDonough Braungart 
Design Chemistry (MBDC), a company founded by William McDonough and 
Michael Braungart, the authors of a book called, not surprisingly, Cradle to 
Cradle. They certify that companies using the term “Cradle to Cradle” are 
implementing the concepts thoroughly. Visit www.c2ccertified.com and 
click through to the certified products to discover companies that are using 
this philosophy in their manufacturing plants, including Steelcase, Pendleton 
Woolen Mills, Aveda, Herman Miller, and the U.S. Postal Service. 
Building alliances for the greater good 
No one group or individual has all the answers. Coming up with innovations 
and viable solutions requires looking beyond our own fields, connecting with 
others who see the world through slightly different lenses, and listening as 
they bring their own unique set of experiences to the problem at hand. As the 
saying goes, necessity is the mother of invention. As we face large modern 
problems, strange bedfellows join to find new solutions. The following are 
just a few stunning examples of what’s possible when we work together. 
	
The Blue Green Alliance (www.bluegreenalliance.org) is a partnership 
founded in 2006 by the Sierra Club and United Steelworkers to advocate for 
good-paying jobs in the green economy. Since its inception, additional unions 
and environmental groups have joined the effort that now brings over six million 
people together to fight for this important cause. 
	
In the field of biomimicry (www.biomimicryguild.com), architects, industrial 
designers, engineers, manufacturers, business owners, and entrepreneurs join 
biologists, chemists, and researchers to find design solutions in the wisdom 
of the natural world. What results from these joint explorations are elegant, 
sustainable innovations in materials, designs, and processes that leverage the 
solutions nature has created through billions of years of evolution.
	
Look beyond your own profession to those with other backgrounds. 
Sometimes the most informative, inspiring conversations happen between 
people who have different perspectives and overlapping interests. By talking 
with others about sustainability and climate change, you may discover new 
career opportunities you may not have considered before.

Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
Implementing efficiency and creativity
Although the word on the street is that it costs more money to go green, busi­
nesses that are making strides toward becoming more sustainable are finding 
just the opposite to be true. By becoming more mindful of how resources are 
used, the actual costs of doing business go down — sometimes quite dramat­
ically. In fact, the savings created through these measures can then be used 
to fund other sustainability initiatives. 
	
In New York City, the Empire State Building is going through an energy retrofit 
expected to cost $20 million, which is admittedly a large chunk of change. But 
that retrofit is going to produce an energy cost savings of $4.4 million dollars 
per year for the owner and the tenants of the building. 
Of course, coming up with the cash upfront is the most challenging part of the 
preceding example. In the case of the Empire State Building, several organiza­
tions, including the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Rocky Mountain Institute, 
Johnson Controls, and Jones Lang LaSalle are funding this project as a model 
to inspire other building owners and cities to retrofit skyscrapers. In other 
situations, creative financing options are being invented to make it possible for 
organizations and homeowners to take action on their desire to be more sus­
tainable. For more information see www.esbsustainability.com.
	
The city of Berkeley, California, has come up with an innovative financing pro­
gram called FIRST (Financing Initiative for Energy Efficiency Renewable and 
Solar Technology), which provides initial capital to homeowners who want 
to install solar technology or make energy efficiency retrofits. The city sells 
bonds to raise funds to pay for the installations; the residents pay the city 
back through property taxes. For more details about this program, visit www.
grist.org/article/berkeley-rules. This creative financing option 
makes solar more attractive and stimulates the solar industry in that region. 
Dawning of a Brand-New Era 
As the green economy takes shape and people recognize how it differs from 
the traditional economy, it’s important to remember that the very first stages 
of the transformation may take years to play out. As cornerstones drop into 
place, we’ll gain more insight into the forms of the green economy. There’s 
no guarantee that the growth will be a steady ride. It’s likely that specific 
industries, companies, and technologies will go through ups and downs as 
the economy matures, markets settle out, and technologies are replaced by 
newer innovations. There will be difficult transitions as traditional industries 
lose market share and new ones take the lead.

29
 Chapter 2: Inside the Green Economy
Eighty-eight percent of 2009 “stimulus package” disbursements were targeted 
toward health care initiatives, education, and income security, whereas 
only 12 percent were aimed at transportation, community development, and 
energy/environment. In 2012, the percentages will shift so that 63 percent 
of the funds will go toward transportation, community development, and 
energy/environment projects. In other words, funds for the greening of the 
economy will continue to be distributed through 2012 from this law alone 
(see www.recovery.gov/?q=content/report-progress for more on 
funding).
	
Green initiatives such as renewable energy, alternative transportation, smart 
grid, energy efficiency strategies, and waste management are going to take 
time to implement. Each industry will develop at a different rate, but it’s 
almost inevitable that we’ll continue to see green innovations and develop­
ments over the next few decades. 
How Durable Is the Green Economy?
Now that this new economy is beginning to roll forward, people I talk to are 
starting to worry. Is the green economy a fad? Is it a bubble, like the mid-
2000s real estate bubble, that’s going to burst suddenly and leave us in the 
dust again? How can we be sure that the green economy is real? 
Although I’m not an economist, politician, or psychic, I have been watching 
developments in the green economy closely since March 2007. Throughout 
that time my team and I have continued to see promising signs of growth, 
innovation, and development. True, any particular industry, company, or 
technology could evaporate in a puff of smoke, but the overall green econ­
omy has a broad foundation and reason for existing now. The following are 
signs that the green economy will gain traction over time:
	
✓	Many experts see the shift to an energy-efficient, clean-energy economy 
as the solution to three of the most significant issues facing the world: 
 
• Scientific evidence demonstrates a serious need to change our way 
of doing business and living. We cannot continue to pull resources 
from the Earth without regard for the future.
 
• Foreign affairs experts note that continuing to rely on foreign oil is 
likely to create more conflicts and much higher prices in the future. 
Creating a domestic source of energy would allow us to have more 
control of the pricing and enhance our national security. 
 
• Economic specialists, who look for ways to jumpstart the economy, 
see that the green economy can stimulate job creation with projects 
that update and rebuild key elements of the infrastructure. 

30
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
	
✓	Previous economic bubbles have been focused on one industry or in a 
couple of closely related industries. The greening of the economy is touch­
ing nearly every industry. Furthermore, green initiatives are being taken 
up by companies around the world. In fact, all sectors of the economy are 
involved, including public and private companies, non-profits, govern­
ment organizations, and joint public-private ventures. 
	
✓	Innovation is occurring from new energy sources, new manufacturing 
materials and processes, new products, new transportation options, 
new ways to process waste, and new building materials and methods. 
Laws, policies, incentives, and disincentives that extend out into the 
future are being put in place to encourage and support new industries.
	
✓	Funding for the green economy is coming from multiple sources, includ­
ing money from the 2009 stimulus package, venture capital companies, 
major corporations, and grant organizations.
That said, there are no guarantees. And yet there is an underlying sense that 
we cannot not transition to a green economy. Read on to discover how you 
can help create the solutions that will have a positive impact on our future.

▶	Making sense of what qualifies as a green job
▶	Discovering where your skills are needed in the green economy
▶	Finding the money in the green economy
▶	Understanding how to identify possible paths into your green career
▶	Knowing what it takes to find your green career
D
epending on your news sources, you may be under the impression that 
green jobs are easy to come by or are scarce. In truth, a lot depends on 
the kind of green job you are looking for, where you live, and what industry 
you are targeting. In this chapter you get an overview of where you can look 
for a green job that fits your needs and interests. A number of factors come 
into play as you figure out which green jobs may be available for someone 
with your skills in your geographic region.
	
With the green economy being as young as it is, there are no definitive defini­
tions, job titles, job descriptions, or career paths established yet. Even if you 
ask a green career guru or a career counselor where you should look for this 
information or that, you may not be very satisfied with the response they 
provide. It’s not that they know and aren’t telling you, it’s that no one person 
or organization has the whole green economy cataloged and accessible at the 
click of a mouse. To succeed, you need to take an active role in understanding 
the green economy, investigating industries that look intriguing, and identifying 
the job titles that are good targets for you. 
Think of the green economy as a working draft rather than a final report. You 
may find industry descriptions to be rather vague and future projections to 
be a bit inconsistent. To get the best possible picture, you need to do your 
own legwork to fill in what you don’t know and connect the dots about what 
you do know. 

32
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
Exploring Where Your Skills Fit
Identifying the green job that’s best for you is a bit like doing a 3-D puzzle. You 
have to understand each piece, make your best attempt to solve the puzzle, 
and then jostle the pieces around a bit to get them all to fit together. The good 
news is that there are more opportunities in the green economy than you prob­
ably know about right now. Before you dive into the process of figuring out the 
puzzle for yourself, take a few minutes to get the lay of the land. 
Defining green jobs
At this point there is no universally agreed upon definition of a “green job.” 
Most will agree that green jobs must improve the environment in some way. 
While useful, that definition isn’t very helpful when you are trying to figure 
out how you want to contribute to the green economy. 
The most helpful definition I’ve seen was developed in preparation for the 
first meeting of the Middle Class Task Force headed up by Vice President 
Biden: www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/save_the_date_1. In this 
definition, green jobs are those that provide “products and services that use 
renewable energy resources, reduce pollution, conserve energy and natural 
resources, and reconstitute waste.”
With specific green goals in the definition, it’s easier to discern exactly how 
green jobs are expected to reduce the impact of humans and industry on the 
environment.
	
Not everyone uses any given definition when they talk about green jobs. When 
you read media stories or read statistics about the green economy, figure out 
how the author or researcher is defining the term green job. If the definition 
only includes jobs in the renewable energy industry, then the statistics aren’t 
covering the entire green economy, but only one industry.
	
As the green economy matures and more companies implement sustain­
ability initiatives, it’s likely we’ll come to a time when all jobs have a green 
component to them. By then, we may not distinguish between green jobs and 
traditional jobs because there won’t be that much difference between the two. 
In the meantime, however, it makes sense to focus on jobs that enable you to 
have the most positive impact on the environment.
Having a direct, positive impact
Most of the green jobs you hear about in the media have a direct impact on the 
state of the planet. Certainly positions with the goals listed in the definition given 
in the last section have a direct effect by decreasing the amount of greenhouse 

33
 Chapter 3: Staking Out a Green Career
gas emissions, waste, and pollution. The people in these jobs see the connection 
between their work and the state of the environment. 
After reviewing the task force definition of a green job, I realized that there 
were a few more ways to improve the environment. As a result, my definition 
of green jobs is a bit broader. The bold components are goals I’ve added:
	
✓	Generate and use clean, renewable energy
	
✓	Reduce pollution
	
✓	Conserve energy and natural resources
	
✓	Reconstitute waste
	
✓	Decrease the use of hazardous materials as inputs and outputs
	
✓	Remediate or reverse human impact on the planet
	
✓	Promote biodiversity and restore ecosystems
Do any of these green goals appeal to you? If so, make a note to yourself. You 
now have a head start for Chapter 4, where you explore your interests. 
Having an indirect, positive impact
Not all jobs in the green economy have a direct impact on the environment. 
Some positions allow people to make their contribution to the planet more 
indirectly. Rather than hands-on, in-the-lab, on-the-roof, or in-the-forest kind 
of work, people who hold these jobs have the following roles: 
	
✓	Creating and enforcing green laws/policies/regulations
	
✓	Educating, inspiring, motivating, and persuading people/companies to 
take greener, more sustainable actions 
	
✓	Funding or investing in green initiatives/companies
Although these green jobs are rarely mentioned by the media, the work done 
in these areas has a profound impact on the shape of the green economy. 
Without updated policies, directed funding, and renewed motivation, the 
green economy won’t develop and grow very effectively. 
Knowing There’s a Place for Your Skills 
At this point, you are probably wondering where your skills fit into the green 
economy. As the green economy evolves, opportunities will develop for 
people in all geographic areas, with all skills and education levels, at all pay 

34
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
grades. To get an idea of what you can expect based on your circumstances, 
take a look at the following descriptions. 
Finding trade opportunities 
By some accounts you may think every green job is a green collar job, or a 
blue collar job with a green focus. Certainly the most common jobs refer­
enced in discussions of the green jobs movement are the solar installer who 
spends his or her time on roof tops and the wind technician who clocks a lot 
of hours high atop wind turbines. 
If you enjoy working with your hands, building things, or making things work 
more efficiently, you’ll find quite a few interesting applications for your skills. 
Beyond solar and wind, you might consider green collar jobs in the manu­
facturing industry, building trade, natural resources management, smart 
grid infrastructure, or energy efficiency projects. If you don’t have the 
skills needed in these industries, refer to Chapter 16 for information about 
strengthening your skills through education. 
Identifying professional jobs 
If you are an individual contributor or manager questioning your green 
career options, don’t give up. The green economy isn’t just for green collar 
workers, it’s for everyone. 
	
✓	Technical roles: If you have a scientific or technical background, you are 
likely to find work in a research capacity, a design role, an engineering 
function, or a computer modeling position. Nearly every industry cat­
egory has the need for people who understand how to design spaces, 
objects, and processes to work efficiently and effectively. 
	
✓	Non-technical positions: If you’re accustomed to working in a business 
setting helping businesses grow, you’ll find the same roles in green 
companies. The one caveat: If you’re targeting an emerging industry, you 
may find that the companies in a research and development mode are not 
quite ready to hire people in operations, finance, marketing, sales, and 
human resources. It’s possible you can get in on the ground floor if you’re 
willing to be a generalist during this phase. Network in your area to find 
out about early-stage opportunities as they become available. Another 
option is to look to established companies that are going green.
	
✓	Management positions: As a manager, director, or executive, you have a 
couple options. If you’re up for a challenge and have experience working 
with start-ups, you may find some once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to 

35
 Chapter 3: Staking Out a Green Career
bring a cutting-edge technology or process to market. If your skills are 
more suited to working with established companies, your best option is 
to look for companies that are in the process of transitioning into 
sustainable businesses. 
Scoping out the geographic trends
Green jobs are sprouting up all over the country. For a visual view of the 
green economy, check out this series of maps created by Earth2Tech, http://
earth2tech.com/maps . At a glance you see where large solar installations, 
wind turbine manufacturers, cellulosic ethanol, and cleantech companies are 
sprouting up around the country. You can also see where coal power plants 
and ethanol plants are losing ground.
Now — and here’s the tricky part — is the green job you want available or 
likely to be available in your area? Maybe yes, maybe no. It depends on where 
you live and whether your chosen industry can thrive in your region. 
This isn’t really a new phenomenon. The U.S. has seen certain industries 
cluster in particular areas due to natural resources or historical events in 
the region. If I say timber, you’ll likely say Northwest. Financial, you’ll likely 
think New York City. If I say automobile manufacturers, Detroit comes to mind, 
and for steel it’s Pennsylvania — beach tourism, California, Florida, or Hawaii. 
You get the idea. Our country is so diverse that each region’s industries have 
developed to take advantage of its resources. 
The green economy is no different. Emerging industries are sprouting up in 
areas that can support the requirements of the industry. Solar, especially the 
utility-sized arrays, are heating up in the Southwest. Wind farms are blowing 
through the entire plains area. Biomass, which depends on green and woody 
growth, is mainly growing in the Mississippi Valley. 
Other industries are evolving out of existing hotbeds of talent. Advocacy and 
lobbying organizations are gaining traction in the Washington, D.C., area and 
in large cities on the coasts that have a base of passionate donors. Cleantech 
hubs are becoming the next generation opportunity for a number of high tech 
centers, such as the Silicon Valley and the Boston area. Manufacturing plants 
around the country are being converted to produce wind turbines, building 
supplies, or solar arrays. Large cities with an abundance of outdated, drafty 
buildings are looking to their unemployed and underemployed to perform 
energy-efficient retrofits on existing buildings. 
One other source of green opportunities in your area may be established 
companies that are implementing sustainability initiatives or working toward 
green goals. Watch your local media to see which local companies to track. 

36
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
	
Look at the inherent strengths of your area to get a sense of the green industries 
that are likely to flourish in your area. What is your area known for? What nat­
ural resources are abundant in your region? Answers to those two questions 
will give you a sense of where to start looking for green opportunities in your 
region. 
Understanding the array of industries
Matching up a green industry with your skills, interests, and experience is 
most likely on your mind as well. Before you hook your green career dreams 
to a particular industry, take some time to familiarize yourself with the full 
range of industries that make up the green economy.
You may be surprised by what you discover. The innovation required to 
reduce greenhouse gases and implement more sustainable processes is 
astounding. With a little exploration, you can find pioneering actions in 
emerging industries, governmental agencies, long-standing industries, well-
known companies, utilities, and nonprofits. Opportunities abound. 
	
To help you further your exploration, Part III of this book includes seven 
chapters that profile a number of industries in categories from environmental 
sciences and natural resources to energy and cleantech. The industry profiles 
also explore industries and functions that shape the economy, inspire, and 
motivate. To jump directly to one that interests you, see the table of contents. 
	
Keep in mind that different green industries are developing at different rates. 
A company that’s in a research and development phase won’t have a place for 
someone with marketing and sales experience. That company is going to be 
allotting its budget to hiring scientists and technical specialists who can help 
bring a product, service, or process to market as quickly as possible. 
While you wait for your target industry or company to be ready to hire 
people with your background, use the intervening time to gain the knowl­
edge, skills, experience, and connections you need to be their ideal can­
didate. Spend time networking, talking with people in the industry, and 
volunteering in ways to develop your skills. Keep your finger on the pulse of 
the industry so you have a sense of when the doors will begin to open. 
Discovering the Earning 
Power of Green Careers
For years now, those who wanted to do work to improve the state of the 
environment knew that they’d make less money than their colleagues who 
worked toward business goals. Many still hold a perception that there’s no 

37
 Chapter 3: Staking Out a Green Career
money in the green economy, that all the work is nonprofit based, and that all 
the hype about green jobs is just that, hype. 
Let me set the record straight. The green jobs of today and tomorrow are 
not the environmental jobs of the past. There’s definitely money flowing into 
the green economy in the form of venture capital funding and partnerships 
between established companies and new companies. In addition, funds from 
the stimulus package (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) are 
flowing to a wide range of recipients from government agencies, states, and 
cities to established companies and start-ups. 
Organizations and companies with money tend to grow their operations by 
hiring more employees, purchasing equipment (that must be manufactured 
by someone, somewhere), and investing in new plants or offices (that must 
be built by someone locally). 
A number of organizations, including Green for All (www.greenforall.org), 
the Apollo Alliance (www.apolloalliance.org), and the Blue Green 
Alliance (www.bluegreenalliance.org) are doing all they can to lobby for 
a green economy built on good, well-paying jobs for all. Although their focus 
is primarily on green collar jobs, their work is acting as a springboard for the 
entire economy that includes a mix of jobs for people at all levels. 
In a Business Week piece, the author worked with PayScale (www.payscale.
com) to identify the best-paying green jobs of 2009. They include a wide range 
of positions, from trade to technical, and nonprofit to executive throughout 
the green economy. For the full scoop, take a few minutes to view the slide 
show of 23 green jobs, ranging in pay from $39,500 to over $100,000: http://

Blazing Your Own Path through 
the Maze of Green Careers
If you’ve been in the work world a while or you’ve listened to how your dad 
started his career, you may have a vision that you’ll get into a green profes­
sion and then have a clear career path to follow as your career matures. The 
idea of this plan no doubt gives you a sense of security. You know where you 
are headed and what it’s going to take to get where you want to go. 
Sorry to burst your bubble, but the green economy doesn’t yet have that 
level of structure built into it. Instead of having an established career path 
that takes you from Job A to Job D, it’s far more likely that each person in 
Job A will embark on their own path to reach their ultimate Job D. It’s not 

38
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
that the green economy is disorganized, it’s that it’s so new and evolving so 
quickly that there are few established job titles, let alone job paths!
Here are a few suggestions to help you glean as much information as possible 
about how companies are structured in the green economy:
	
✓	Emerging industries are going to be the most difficult to figure out. 
You’ll need to spend time understanding the industry as a whole and 
then figure out how companies within the industry are structured. In 
early stage industries, each company is likely to have its own process, 
job titles, and even department structure. As the industry develops 
some standard practices, you’ll see more continuity across companies 
in the same industry. 
	
✓	In industries that are growing and maturing, such as the solar and wind 
industries, you can begin to see some standardization in their job titles 
and functions that you didn’t see just a few years ago. You’ll still need to 
do your homework, but getting a good picture of one company should 
help you get a handle on how other companies in the industry are struc­
tured. Your industry association or professional association may have 
some resources to help you. 
	
✓	If you’re looking for a position in one of the more-established industries 
such as environmental sciences or natural resources management, 
you’ll actually be able to find some job titles on government produced 
occupation networks such as O*Net (http://online.onetcenter.
org/find). Be aware, however, that the listings may not include all 
the latest information about innovations and green trends in your field. 
Nevertheless, it’s a good place to start. 
	
✓	Established industries that are going green, such as green building or 
green IT, may have a lot of the same job titles they’ve always had. The 
main difference is in what you need to know to excel in the field. It’s also 
possible that a few new job titles will emerge as new positions evolve in 
the green versions of these industries. Large, existing companies may 
have a similar strategy. Most of their departments and job titles remain 
the same with the exception of a few new job titles for special projects 
or new responsibilities. 
Doing a Reality Check
As you consider your green career options, it’s possible you’ll discover 
that your green career is more of a long-term goal than a short-term reality. 
Whether you’re currently employed or out of work, you can make significant 
progress toward your green career while also attending to the realities of 
your current situation. 

39
 Chapter 3: Staking Out a Green Career
If you’re employed and can’t imagine switching jobs right now, focus on green­
ing your current job (see Chapter 22 for strategies you can use), building your 
green network (see Chapter 15), and strengthening your green training (see 
Chapter 16). During this period you can also use your time to identify your 
green focus as I describe in Chapters 4 through 6. 
If you’re currently out of work or seriously underemployed, consider these 
strategies to get you back on track. 
	
✓	Interim job: Find a job that allows you to bring money in the door but 
doesn’t take all your energy by the end of the day. A low-stress job that 
leaves you with energy at the end of the day may be exactly what you 
need to continue your quest for your green career. 
	
✓	Stepping stone job: Look for a position that helps you build the skills 
you need to leap into your ultimate position when it becomes available. 
Be very strategic as you make your decision about which job to take. 
	
✓	Bootstrap job: Do whatever you can to piece together enough income 
to keep you going. It may not be pretty, but the variable schedule gives 
you opportunities to volunteer, work on entrepreneurial projects, go to 
school, and identify your green focus. 
Succeeding in Your Quest
Changing your career direction is a significant decision on a good day. 
Making the choice to enter the green economy ups the ante even more. Use 
the following tips to stay focused as you step toward your green career:
	
✓	Staying informed: The green economy is currently in its infancy. Over 
time, as the economy develops, some industries will thrive, others 
will change in response to the marketplace and new technologies, and 
others will fade away into the sunset. The only way you can know where 
your target industry is heading is to track the factors that are shaping 
the green economy, your industry, sustainability, your profession, and 
the technology and processes unique to your field. Instead of being 
blindsided by these developments, use the changes you see to make 
strategic decisions about your future. 
	
✓	Taking the initiative: Your green career is not going to be handed to 
you on a silver platter, you must take an active role in finding your 
place in the green economy. Throughout this book you find the tips, 
resources, and action steps I’ve pulled together from conversations with 
green career explorers, green job seekers, green career changers, and 
green career experts. The more of these you can put into action, the 
more you will see the results you are striving for. 

40
Part I: Discovering the Green Frontier 
	
✓	Becoming an activist: On occasion, you may find your career hanging in 
the balance as new laws, regulations, incentives, and disincentives are 
introduced or reach their expiration date. Stay alert. If you haven’t yet 
subscribed to a newsletter for your profession or industry, it is time to do 
so. When your industry or profession is galvanizing its members to call 
for passing or defeating a certain measure, you need to pay attention. 
	
✓	Demonstrating your commitment to the planet: Green employers want 
to hire job candidates who walk their talk. It’s not enough to pretend you 
are green. Employers will know in a heartbeat if you aren’t authentic. 
You must find ways to show prospective employers that you are com­
mitted to the environment and sustainability. Check out the Cheat Sheet 
at the front of the book for tips on how to green your resume. 
	
✓	Establishing your leadership: During the early stages of the green econ­
omy, everyone must be a leader. Whether your job involves using a new 
technology, engaging people to take new actions, or encouraging your 
management team to make a process more sustainable, you must have 
leadership skills to get the job done. Look for opportunities to develop 
and demonstrate your leadership skills. 
	
✓	Navigating a changing world: If you want to work in the first wave of the 
green economy, you must be comfortable with uncertainty. To thrive, you 
must be able to go with the flow when plans change, stay focused, pick up 
on trends amid the random noise of constant change, and change goals 
midstream as new circumstances demand it. Are you ready?
If you’re just starting out on your quest for a green career, you may feel over­
whelmed by all the options and directions you could go. Everything looks so 
interesting it’s hard to narrow down your focus. Begin by keeping track of the 
topics that interest you. As you collect these clues, you’ll begin to see pos­
sible themes develop. It’s those trends that point you in the right direction 
for your career. Chapters 4 through 6 give you a step-by-step process you 
can use to clarify your green focus.

Finding Your 
Green Focus

In this part . . .
O
pportunities within the green economy are so 
numerous you can’t possibly investigate each and 
every one. The key to success is to identify the part of the 
green economy that best fits your skills, interests, experi­
ence, and education. In this part you discover how to 
identify your green focus. With your green direction in 
mind, all parts of your green career search become more 
streamlined and effective.

Chapter 4
Pursuing Your Interests: Finding 
Green Topics That Engage You
In This Chapter
▶	Building a list of topics to consider
▶	Discovering what fascinates you
▶	Finding topics through everyday activities
▶	Fine-tuning your list of interests
T
he green economy, as you’ve probably guessed by now, consists of a 
vast array of opportunities. Because you’re looking for a green career, 
this may be both good news and bad news. The good news is that you are 
likely to find a career that matches your interests pretty well within the 
various green industries and professions. The bad news is that if you don’t 
have well-defined interests to use as starting points, you may become over­
whelmed and confused in the land of green opportunity. 
The suggestions and activities in this chapter help you identify your own 
personal interests — the topics that excite you and point you toward your 
green career. And this process is enriched by taking a little time to devote to 
thoughtful consideration of many interests in your life. Although you may be 
drawn to organic food, renewable energy, or green building, for example, it is 
likely that you have many more interests than the one or two you can identify 
in the moment. 
Throughout this chapter are real-life activities to help you uncover the inter­
ests that are clues to your future green career. In Chapter 6 you continue 
your journey, discovering the strengths you can draw from your education, 
experience, and talents.

Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Recognizing and Listing Your Interests
You main goal in this chapter is to create a long list of topics of interest, 
which you will ultimately narrow down to your top ten. By tapping into activi­
ties you do every day, you may be surprised how quickly your list comes 
together. 
How do you know what your interests are? Well, you are what you do. In 
a nutshell, your favorite topics are pretty much certain to be the subjects 
you like to discuss, debate with others, read about, and ponder. Nonfiction 
books, documentary films, magazine and newspaper articles, and even blog 
posts are generally written about particular topics or sets of related topics. 
For example, the subjects of this book are green careers and the green econ­
omy. The subject of the documentary An Inconvenient Truth is global warm­
ing. The topic of Green Eggs and Ham is green eggs and ham.
The trick to creating your rich list of interests is noticing which topics inter­
est you most. As you consider whether to add a topic to your list, take a 
moment to see if it fits one or more (or all) of the following descriptions:
	
✓	The topic is like a magnet. It draws you in. You keep returning to it time 
and again.
	
✓	The topic excites you. You like to think about it, talk about it, read 
about it, and maybe even dream about it. 
	
✓	The topic keeps you focused. Time flies when you are thinking about it.
	
✓	The topic inspires you to make new connections. You discover new 
insights when you consider the topic. 
	
✓	The topic engages you. You want to explore and gain as much new 
information about it as possible.
	
Don’t set your threshold so high that nothing meets the standard. If you are 
interested in the topic, record it on your list.
Recognizing when your voice 
signals your passion
One of the best ways to spot a passion is to pay attention to your voice when 
you talk about various topics. Your voice is a great tool for judging how 
excited you are about a particular topic. As you listen, notice the general 
intensity with which you speak, including the following: 

45
 Chapter 4: Pursuing Your Interests: Finding Green Topics That Engage You
	
✓	The speed of your words: The faster you talk, the more excited you are. 
	
✓	The insistence in your voice: If you try to convince, persuade, or edu­
cate someone on a topic, you’re probably a proponent of the cause you 
are speaking about. 
	
✓	The duration of your monologues: If you talk nonstop for any length of 
time, you are fascinated by the topic.
	
If you have a hard time hearing changes in your own voice, recruit your 
friends and loved ones to point out, in the moment, when you are speaking 
dynamically. As soon as you realize you are speaking from a passionate place, 
take a moment to recognize what you are talking about. That topic, whatever 
it is, is of importance to you. Place it on your list of interests. 
Staying open to possibilities
One of the biggest mistakes people make when identifying their interests 
is getting attached to one, and only one, interest too early in the process. 
This can lead to the exclusion of others. As you are building your list, keep 
a broad focus. If a topic strikes your fancy, add it to your list. Don’t worry 
about whether you have the training, education, or experience to incorporate 
this topic into your work. At this stage of the game, it’s all about what fasci­
nates, intrigues, excites, and engages you.
	
Ultimately, your green career is likely to be a combination of a number of 
interests identified with the help of this chapter, woven together with the 
strengths you define in Chapter 5.
	
Although you may be tempted to focus solely on green topics, I encourage you 
to keep the door open to all possibilities. Give yourself permission to explore 
the following: 
	
✓	Green topics such as sustainability, environmental, ecology, recycling, 
socially responsible investing, energy efficiency, renewable energy, 
cleantech, conservation, organic, waste, mass transit, carbon neutrality, 
cap and trade, greenhouse gases, carbon emissions
	
✓	Non-green topics such as fashion, travel, business, cars, food, sports, 
design, home and garden, politics, entertainment, finance, antiques, 
genealogy, pop culture, building
	
✓	Combined topics such as organic gardening, eco travel, sustainable tex­
tiles, green design, green building
	
Think of your initial list of topics of interest as your first draft. You have an 
opportunity to edit and refine your list later in this chapter. 

46
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Looking at Your Actions
Although you may be able to come up with a list of interests right off the top 
of your head, don’t be surprised if you get stuck. You’ve heard the phrase 
actions speak louder than words. That phrase is certainly true when you are 
searching for clues about your interests. Your everyday actions and habits 
hold a number of clues about your interests.
In this section are a number of activities that can bring your interests to light. 
Don’t feel you need to follow through on every suggested activity. Choose at 
least one activity from each section. Do a few more if you are getting good 
results and want to collect more insights. 
	
Each time you take an excursion, virtually or in the real world, take a note pad 
with you. Jot down the topics you are intrigued by. Although you may think it’s 
safe to wait until you get home to record your discoveries, I encourage you to 
write topics down as you find them. You don’t want to lose any clues, do you?
Studying what you read and watch
What you read can provide an excellent real-time glimpse into your interests. 
The following are some ideas to get a sense of what your interests are, based 
on what you read or watch:
	
✓	Take a tour of your personal bookshelf, local bookstore, or library. 
What kinds of books do you own? What books do you pick up at the 
bookstore or library? What sections of the bookstore or library do you 
gravitate toward? If you aren’t able to go to a location with physical 
books, take a spin around your favorite online bookstore. Your goal will 
be the same: to identify the kinds of books you enjoy.
	
✓	Visit a magazine stand. Take an excursion to a local store with a wide vari­
ety of magazines. Give yourself an hour to browse the magazine racks. What 
magazines are you drawn to? What articles do you want to read? You may 
find you are drawn to a number of topics. Record them all on your list. 
	
✓	Scan your favorite Internet bookmarks. What Web sites are among 
your favorites? What kinds of sites do you visit over and over again? 
What topics do they address that fascinate you? 
	
✓	Look for blogs that intrigue you. Don’t have a magazine stand in town? 
No problem. A virtual magazine stand called Alltop (www.alltop.com) 
pulls together the top blogs on different topics and shows you links to 
their articles on particular subjects. For example, entering green in the 
search box brings up a host of links to environmental blogs on all kinds 
of topics. Visit the site to scan the categories they have listed, enter a 
keyword for topics you want to read, or explore the alphabetical lists of 
topics they provide. 

47
 Chapter 4: Pursuing Your Interests: Finding Green Topics That Engage You
	
✓	Listen to iTunes or watch YouTube. If you aren’t a reader or you prefer 
to listen to others read a book, give a presentation, or discuss a topic, 
you may prefer to look beyond the written word to audio and video. 
After you listen to or watch a selection, take a moment to determine the 
main focus of the recording. Include the topic on your list. 
 
•	iTunes: To search the iTunes Store podcast directory, click 
Podcasts and scan the Categories or Featured Providers boxes in 
the left-hand column for topics that interest you. Or just search 
iTunes by using keywords and pay attention to the podcast items 
that your search returns. 
 
• YouTube (www.youtube.com): Click on Videos or Channels 
to click through on video categories or search by using your 
keywords. 
Tracking what you are drawn to explore
Another source of clues to your interests is your desire to explore various 
topics. What topics do you want to know more about? What topics are you 
motivated to spend time delving into? 
	
✓	Browse course listings. Pick up a course catalog or browse course list­
ings online for your local university, community college, adult education 
courses, and recreation center. Imagine you have all the time and money 
you need. What courses would you like to take? Write down the names 
of the ones that most interest you.
	
✓	Surf the Web. Give yourself a couple uninterrupted hours to surf the 
Web. Follow links wherever they take you. Notice which pages interest 
you and record the topic that each addresses. Add the most interesting 
sites to your bookmarks so you can go back later for further exploration. 
File those bookmarks in a new bookmark folder called “Green Careers” 
or something similar.
	
	Search Google News (news.google.com) for the words green or envi­
ronment to return a huge list of current relevant news items.
	
✓	Scan groups on social networking sites. Look at the groups you belong 
to on your social networking sites. Do you see any themes? Experiment 
to discover what other groups you might want to add. 
 
• Flip through Facebook. Go to the Info tab on your profile and 
scroll to the bottom to see the groups you already belong to. 
Click See All to review your groups. See any themes emerging? At 
the very bottom of the page, look for a list of group categories or 
use the search field to explore ideas on your mind. If you prefer, 
use the search box at the top of any Facebook page to begin your 
exploration (www.facebook.com).

48
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
 
• Mine MySpace. Navigate to the list of groups by hovering over the 
More tab, and selecting Groups. Play with the categories or enter 
keywords to delve into a topic of your choice (www.myspace.com).
 
• Look through LinkedIn. Use the group directory (www.linkedin.
com/groupsDirectory) to scan groups or search by keyword. 
You might begin with your current profession and add words such 
as green, sustainable, socially responsible. 
 
• Search Yahoo!. On Yahoo! you can also use the search box or 
browse the existing groups (http://groups.yahoo.com). 
Explore Wikipedia
The free online encyclopedia has more than ten million articles and keeps 
growing. Each article is the collaborative effort of volunteers around the 
globe. Search by using keywords of your choice or browse listed topics to 
drill down to explore their various facets.
Consider exploring the following parts of Wikipedia:
	
✓	Overviews: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/
Overviews
	
✓	Lists of topics: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Contents/
Lists_of_topics
	
✓	Academic disciplines: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_
academic_disciplines
	
✓	Current events: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_
events
	
✓	Annual summary: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009 (change 
the year to see past annual summaries or projected calendars of future 
years.)
	
Your goal is not to find out everything about the world in one sitting. Your job, 
right now, is to notice which topics intrigue you and hold your attention. 
Noticing how you spend your time
How you spend your time is another powerful indicator of your interests. 
Although your former school and work experiences are an obvious source of 
clues to your next career, you may be surprised to discover what your hob­
bies and volunteer activities tell you about possible career directions as well. 

49
 Chapter 4: Pursuing Your Interests: Finding Green Topics That Engage You
Take a stroll down memory lane to revisit different phases of your life. Think 
back to how you spent your time through the years. Notice and record any 
topics or activities that intrigued you and excited you over the years. 
	
✓	Youth: What activities did you enjoy as a child? What clubs did you 
belong to? What hobbies excited you? What subjects did you enjoy in 
school? What did you dream about doing when you grew up?
	
✓	School years: During your middle-school, high-school, college, or trade-
school years, what else did you do besides study? Did you volunteer for 
any causes? What were your favorite courses and your most interesting 
school projects? What did you argue about with roommates?
	
✓	Early adult years: Did your passions run high about any topic in particu­
lar? How did your actions contribute to those around you? What groups 
did you belong to? 
	
✓	Professional years: If you are a professional who has been in the work­
force, what were your favorite positions throughout your career? How 
did you spend your non-work hours? What causes did you volunteer for? 
	
✓	Retirement years: If you have already retired and are looking for a new 
way to make a difference, how have you been spending your time since 
you left the work world? If you have stayed engaged in work, what proj­
ects have kept you coming back for more? 
Tapping into Your Dreams
Up until now you’ve been revisiting your past to excavate clues about your 
future. Now it’s time to turn your attention toward the future. As you look 
forward, what dreams do you hold for yourself? If you could do what engages 
you most, what would it be? The triggers in this section help you fill in the 
details of your dreams.
	
Are there any dreams you let go of in the past that still come back to you at 
times? Perhaps reality got in the way of your dreams a while ago. Perhaps 
your finances or family responsibilities kept you from following through on 
your dreams. Your interests from the past are still rich sources of potential 
for your future career. You may, however, find it difficult to pull past dreams 
into the present time. If you are experiencing this difficulty, give yourself some 
time. Sit with the questions in this section and allow memories and wisps of 
your past dreams to return to you. 

50
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Identifying those you want to help
Sometimes the core feature of a dream is the kind of people, group, organiza­
tion, cause, animal, or ecosystem you want to help. By claiming who or what 
you want to work with, you begin to define your vision. 
	
Even if you haven’t ever had a long-term dream, you can still explore these 
questions to gather clues to create your vision of your future career.
	
✓	If you could work with anyone, who would you be drawn to work with? 
Who would you like to help? 
	
✓	Where would they live or work? 
	
✓	Would you rather work with individuals, businesses, governments, orga­
nizations, schools, nonprofits, animals, or out in nature?
	
✓	What cause engages the folks you’d like to help? 
	
✓	What problem would they need help to solve? 
	
After working in a wildlife sanctuary in Oregon, Laurie Marker became 
intrigued with the cheetah in her care. She has since dedicated her career to 
discovering as much as she can about cheetahs. Her passion for the well-being 
of these animals led her to analyze the genetics of breeding cheetah at the 
National Zoo. Eventually she decided to leave the United States for Namibia, 
Africa, to found the Cheetah Conservation Fund (www.cheetah.org). This 
organization is now an award-winning model for wildlife conservation and 
management.
Discovering where in the world 
you want to have an impact
Do you imagine working in a particular location or setting? Sometimes getting 
a clear picture of where you’d like to work begins to bring your career into 
focus.
Do you want to work
	
✓	In your home country or abroad? 
	
✓	Locally or globally?
	
✓	In person or virtually? 
	
✓	In a manufacturing plant, in nature, on the road, or in an office?
	
✓	Within an organization or as a liaison between various groups?

51
 Chapter 4: Pursuing Your Interests: Finding Green Topics That Engage You
Another way to tackle this question is to consider where you feel most com­
fortable or most productive. Look to your past experiences to recall where 
you felt most alive at work or in school. Experiment with how to translate 
those experiences into your vision of the future. 
Highlighting Your Top Interests
At this point, you should know basically what your interests are. In fact, if 
you haven’t simply daydreamed through this chapter, you now likely have a 
long list of topics that intrigue you. Now the question is: Which of your ideas 
are most likely to lead you to your future career?
Your list is like a pie, hot and fresh out of the oven. Set it aside for a while — 
longer than a pie, say, for a day or two. When you return to it, take a new look 
at your list and notice which interests stand out more than others.
Select the ten interests you would most like to address in your work. As you 
identify your favorite interests, don’t concern yourself with what makes 
sense financially, or what is feasible based on your education and back­
ground, or what appears to be fashionable today. Focus instead on your 
passions. Every topic that makes it onto the new, edited version of your list 
should excite you. 
Keep your list in a journal or on your computer where you can access it easily. 
Feel free to make changes as you discover new interests or notice interests 
fading over time. Keep this list as fresh and vibrantly alive as possible. 
	
The topics on your list are not your career ideas. They are the subjects you’d 
like to incorporate into your career in some way. In all likelihood, you’ll com­
bine several of your ideas and skills into your future green career.

Chapter 5
Playing to Your Strengths in the 
Green Careers Arena
In This Chapter
▶	Identifying problems you know how to solve
▶	Finding your favorite skills
▶	Brainstorming possible career ideas
▶	Wrestling with gaps between your vision and reality
T
o land a new job, you must be able to communicate your ability to solve 
problems and achieve results. Communicating your track record and 
your skills effectively and accurately requires you to do a bit of detective 
work before you even begin your job search. 
In the first half of this chapter you discover how to delve into your education, 
work history, and volunteer work for evidence of your strengths. In some 
cases you are searching for the skills you’ve developed through training or 
experience. In other cases you are looking for evidence of your natural tal­
ents or aptitudes — the skills you have by virtue of being you. 
What makes you appealing to some employers, and not others, is that your 
unique combination of skills, training, and natural talents looks likely to 
help the organization address an issue they are facing. By identifying your 
strengths, you gain valuable insights about how to position yourself in the 
green economy. In Chapter 17 you have the opportunity to communicate 
your strengths in a way that captures the attention of prospective employers. 
In the second half of this chapter you use your favorite skills from the first 
half and your favorite interests from Chapter 4 to brainstorm possible career 
ideas. From there, you begin to sort out the best way to move from where 
you are now to where you want to be. 

54
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
	
If you want to enjoy your work, use this opportunity to identify the problems 
you are able to solve by using skills and talents you enjoy most. Then at the 
end of the day, when you accept the best job offer on the table, you have 
landed a job that allows you to use the skills and talents that fulfill you.  
	
As you prepare to read this chapter, pull out a piece of paper, grab a note­
book, or open a file on your computer. As the questions trigger memories, jot 
down notes about the projects you’ve worked on, problems you’ve solved, 
and training you’ve received. About halfway through the chapter, you use the 
notes to pull together a list of your favorite skills. 
Pinpointing the Problems You Have 
the Training to Solve
One of the best ways to uncover the skills you have is to identify the prob­
lems you know how to solve based on your education and your training. 
Think of a problem as something that stands in the way of an organization 
reaching its goals.
Each company, government agency, nonprofit, educational institution, and 
start-up, strives to achieve a wide variety of goals. In the following list are a 
sampling of goals that organizations wrestle with and an example of how an 
employee might help the organization reach a goal in that arena.
	
✓	Green goals:
 
• Carbon emissions goals: Finding ways to use renewable energy 
sources within the company
 
• Waste-management goals: Reducing the amount of waste that goes 
to landfill.
 
• Energy efficiency goals: Eliminating leaks in the heating system
 
• Time efficiency goals: Streamlining production processes
	
✓	Customer service goals:
 
• Reducing customer complaints
 
• Providing training to increase quality
	
✓	Financial goals:
 
• Cost goals: Sourcing goods from new suppliers
 
• Marketing goals: Increasing the number of people who respond to 
a special offer

55
 Chapter 5: Playing to Your Strengths in the Green Careers Arena
 
• Income or sales goals: Up-selling customers to larger packages
 
• Fundraising goals: Managing campaign to raise funds for organization
	
✓	Regulatory goals:
 
• Compliance goals: Implementing a tracking system to eliminate 
lapses in compliance
 
• Hazardous waste goals: Managing federal and state paper work for 
transportation and disposal of hazardous waste
Review the following questions and write down the problems you are able 
to solve for organizations as a result of what you know. At first you may be 
tempted to list the topics you addressed in each of these venues, but taking it 
a bit deeper allows you to connect what you know with how you can contrib­
ute to your future employer.
	
✓	Coursework: Think back to your school years. What courses did you 
take that prepared you to solve problems in the workplace? 
	
✓	School projects: What projects did you work on in school that focused 
on real-life problems or could be transferred to business issues? 
	
✓	Certifications: Have you completed any certifications or extra course­
work that gave you specific knowledge and skills to tackle work-related 
problems? Think about courses you were required to take by your 
employer as well as certifications you chose to complete. 
	
✓	Conferences: Review the conferences you’ve attended over the years for 
your profession, industry, or region. What did you discover during these 
conferences that helps you contribute to business goals? 
	
✓	Training: If you received training for your job (perhaps when you 
were promoted, transferred, or new to the organization) you may have 
another source of clues to problems you can solve. 
	
Don’t be concerned if your list is fairly short at this point. In the next few sec­
tions you discover several other sources of clues to add to your list. After 
working with the next few sections, you may be able to come back to this sec­
tion with more insight and clarity about what fits on your list. 
Searching for What You 
Have Solved in the Past 
The work you have done in full-time positions, contract gigs, part-time jobs 
and volunteer activities may be a rich source of clues to the way you’ve 
solved problems in the past. Activities in your personal life may also provide 
inspiration in this section.

56
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Take some time to think about the roles you’ve held. In each case review how 
the position prepared you to help your next employer break through obsta­
cles to meet their goals. 
	
✓	Work responsibilities: What are your usual duties on your job? What 
does your organization expect you to be able to do for them? Think specif­
ically about the ways in which you help your employers reach their goals.
	
✓	Work projects: What special projects have you worked on? Perhaps 
your manager gave you an assignment outside your usual duties 
because you showed talent or aptitude to fulfill a particular need the 
organization had. Or you may have volunteered to tackle a particular 
problem for your organization. 
	
✓	Volunteer projects: How have you volunteered your talents? Think 
about the organizations you’ve volunteered with and the projects you’ve 
worked on. Were there any volunteer positions that gave you a feeling of 
satisfaction and accomplishment?
	
✓	Personal life experience: What situations have you faced, and perhaps 
conquered, in your life? Do any of these experiences give you a special 
set of skills that you could contribute to your work? 
	
No need to go overboard with this activity. The key is to drill down to the 
problems and projects you’ve enjoyed working on through your work and per­
sonal activities. If there’s a problem you have the skill or talent to resolve, but 
you are miserable doing that work, it’s probably best to keep that problem off 
your list. Even if you eventually need to fall back on that skill to transition into 
a new industry, the skill will be there when you need it. 
Determining the Dilemmas You 
Have a Passion to Solve
Sometimes your ability to solve a problem comes from your passion to do so. 
You may not have previous experience that is directly related or the relevant 
training, but you have within you a fire the drives you to figure out what must 
be done to tackle the issue at hand. 
	
✓	Exploring cutting-edge opportunities: When you look at the green econ­
omy, do any new industries and technologies grab your attention? Can 
you see yourself contributing to a field that is barely on anyone’s radar 
yet? Scan future trends for possible problems you’d like to solve. 
	
✓	Examining what irks you: What bugs you may actually inspire you to 
do great things. Are there any issues related to the green movement 
that make you mad as a hornet? Maybe you don’t understand why your 
family, friends, and colleagues don’t get it when the issue is as clear as 

57
 Chapter 5: Playing to Your Strengths in the Green Careers Arena
day to you. Are you fired up about improving energy efficiency, doing 
away with unnecessary waste, creating greener buildings, or ending 
dependence on oil? Do you have ideas that could start turning the tide 
on these issues that are critical to our times? 
	
	The issue that weighs me down these days is that Texas-sized collec­
tion of plastic garbage swirling in middle of the Pacific ocean (www.
cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/08/04/pacific.garbage.patch/
index.html). I haven’t come up with a solution to this problem yet, but 
I sure wish we could all put our heads together to find a way to eliminate 
this senseless expression of our overindulgence. Mad as a hornet! 
	
✓	Revisiting your childhood passions and worries: Were you concerned 
about the environment as a youngster or young adult? Did you feel pas­
sionately about one or more environmental issues? What you were drawn 
to explore as a child may point you toward a passion that has been dor­
mant for years. Turn back the clock to see if you can recall issues. 
	
	When I was in grade school, I distinctly remember trying to figure out 
how to capture the water that ran, untouched, down the drain as people 
brushed their teeth, soaped up their hands, or waited for the hot water 
to reach the faucet. Although I turned off the water as much as I could 
during those daily tasks, I knew that others didn’t. It bothered me that 
such a precious resource was literally going down the drain. I got as far 
as thinking of a two-pipe system, where one set of pipes was for outgo­
ing water that had been used and another set of pipes for outgoing water 
that was really still clean and useable. The grey water systems of today 
are a variation of what I used to ponder. 
	
	About the same time, my parents were leading a community group to 
establish a recycling center in our small town. Although we were just 
gathering glass and cans at the time, the idea of a full-scale recycling 
plant with dump trucks, conveyor belts, and stations for each kind of 
waste sparked my imagination. I remember creating a diorama in a 
bright yellow box with my version of a recycling system, complete with 
bicycle tire conveyor belts, my brother’s matchbox-sized dump truck, 
and bits of grass, paper, glass, cardboard, and metal I’d collected from 
around our house. Decades later when I delivered my own recyclables to 
the local recycling center, I was stunned to see a bright yellow recycling 
system that was like a full-sized replica of my own diorama.
	
	Although I don’t have any direct training to contribute to these issues, 
I see that I am passionate about the environment and how our daily 
decisions and actions have a profound impact on the planet. In many 
ways my passions contribute to my work as I make sense of the green 
economy for those who want to plug into a green career.
	
	How might your passions and frustrations fuel the greening of your 
career? Although the connection may not be immediately clear, embrace 
your present and past passions. By giving them the light of day, you may 
be surprised how influential they become in defining your green career.

Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Identifying Your Top Strengths
If you’ve read up to this point, by now you have scanned your education, 
your work experience, your volunteer experiences, and your childhood 
dreams to determine which problems you’ve solved in the past. The next 
step is to work backward from these problems and projects to identify the 
skills you possess that enable you to do the work that you do.
You may notice certain themes repeating through your history or that you 
have a wide-ranging array of projects and experiences to draw from. Either 
scenario works; the key is to focus on how your skills allow you to leverage 
your background as you prepare to enter the green economy. 
Take another look at the list of problems, business goals, and dreams you 
identified as you read this chapter (you have started your list, right?). Use 
the following tips to identify the skills you had to possess to reach a success­
ful outcome in each scenario:
	
✓	Think in terms of words that end in –ing. Gerunds, as they’re called, refer 
to the name of an action. Thinking in gerunds helps you identify the 
action that you took to achieve results.
	
✓	Be as specific as possible as you describe the action you took to com­
plete your tasks and help your organization reach its intended goal. Play 
with the wording until the phrase reflects exactly what you did.
	
✓	Focus most of your attention on the projects you enjoyed working on. 
These projects almost always combined the highest concentration of 
skills you like to use. If you liked a certain part of a project, give special 
attention to the skills you used in that situation. 
	
✓	If you have projects that seem to cluster around a particular theme, 
think of them as a group rather than as individual projects. This big-
picture view may illuminate skills you wouldn’t see if you looked at each 
project separately. 
	
✓	If you have listed a wide variety of projects, keep an open mind as you 
sort through each one to find the key skills. Your themes may appear 
when you look at your final list of skills rather than at your list of projects. 
	
✓	Don’t forget to include skills you’d like to use more or skills you’d like to 
develop in a more meaningful way. Perhaps you’ve always wanted to fly 
kites. You’ve never flown kites before, but you know you’d love gaining 
the skill and using the skill in your work. If this is the case, then by all 
means add flying kites to your list. 
	
✓	For now don’t be overly concerned about how the skills fit together to 
create a job or whether there’s any way to make money with the skill. 
You’ll have an opportunity to wrestle with these realities soon enough.

Heath noticed a theme of event planning in his volunteer and work history as 
well as his personal life. In addition to throwing some amazing theme parties 
over the years, he has also organized trade shows and incentive travel for his 
company’s sales team. As he began to list his actions, he came up with this 
list:
	
✓	Organizing event logistics
	
✓	Designing the theme and decorations
	
✓	Budgeting 
	
✓	Project planning
	
Michelle was surprised to see building show up as a theme in her walk through 
her past. In addition to managing an extensive remodeling project on her 
home, she was also involved in building out new office space for her company. 
The actions that seemed most relevant to Michelle included:
	
✓	Evaluating blueprints
	
✓	Choosing appropriate fixtures and coverings for space, function, and 
aesthetics
	
✓	Researching energy-efficient solutions
	
✓	Designing spaces to resolve workflow issues
As you review your list of skills, identify the ones you consider to be your 
favorites. Fine-tune your collection of skills until you have a final list of ten 
you’d like to incorporate into your future career. Don’t worry if they don’t all 
fit together in a nice cohesive list; they’ll still be useful to you.
Weaving Your Interests 
and Skills Together
Most career changers try to identify their next career by using their key skill 
or interest. In fact, your future career, whether green or purple, is likely to 
be a combination of your skills and interests. In many cases, the most viable 
career idea comes out of a combination that you have never considered 
before. 
	
Before you continue with this section, leave your preconceived notions about 
your future green career at the door. You can always pick them up again later 
if you care to, but holding onto them right now only limits your ability to think 
expansively.

60
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Begin your exploration by bringing your list of interests from Chapter 4 and 
your list of skills from this chapter together. Either lay the two lists out next 
to each other or combine your list of ten skills and ten interests onto the 
same piece of paper or screen. As you review your complete lists, consider 
the following questions.
	
✓	Do you see any entries that seem to group together naturally? If so, 
jot the skills and interests down in clusters. Feel free to reuse the same 
phrase in multiple clusters. You may discover that all your ideas seem 
to fall under one general umbrella or that there are two or three group­
ings that are worth considering.
	
✓	Do any combinations stand out as particularly intriguing to you? 
Perhaps you see a possibility you’ve never considered before or one 
that triggers you to think of multiple green career possibilities.
	
✓	Do any combinations stimulate you to think of innovative ideas? New 
thoughts may trigger a series of ideas about a particular field or problem.
	
✓	Is there a pairing that you are particularly well suited to pursue? If 
you see a connection between two seemingly distinct ideas, you may 
have just identified a skill/interest combination that makes you uniquely 
qualified to contribute something of substance to a lucky employer.
	
While giving a presentation at a university green fair recently, I met a young 
woman who had a distinct combination of skills and interests. On the one 
hand, she was fascinated by fashion, particularly fashion created from recy­
cled and renewable materials. As we spoke, I could see her booth behind her 
where she was displaying formal gowns she had designed and constructed 
from recycled magazine pages and other reused materials. On the other hand, 
she was working toward her engineering degree. Although these two arenas 
seem worlds apart, this young woman has a tremendous opportunity to make 
her mark on the world of eco-textiles as a result of her unique combination of 
education and interests. Everyone who heard her story was inspired by her 
combined passion for these two topics.
As you consider possible directions for your green career, keep your lists of 
skills and interests and your list of potential ideas close at hand. Resist the 
temptation to run with the first idea that comes to you. Instead, sit with your 
list for a few days. Let your list incubate as you consider your options, play 
with possibilities, and explore various angles. 
If you keep coming back to the same ideas or constellation of ideas, it’s likely 
you are interested in pursuing a career that falls in that area. As you move 
through the different phases of exploring your ideas and evaluating your 
options, don’t be alarmed if your target career idea changes. Shifts are natu­
ral at this point as you discover new aspects of your target field and as the 
field itself continues its own evolution.

61
 Chapter 5: Playing to Your Strengths in the Green Careers Arena
If you aren’t yet clear which direction you want to take, don’t be alarmed. It 
is likely you need more information before you can settle on a career idea. If 
you have a sense of which green industry you’d like to work in, scan Chapters 
7 through 13 to find a profile of that industry and related industries and use 
the tactics described in Chapter 14 to gain more knowledge about your target 
industry.
Another option to gain more clarity is to get involved in your local green 
community to do some hands-on exploration of various green issues. With 
more experience, you may find that your options come into focus more 
easily.
Bridging the Gap between Your Vision 
and Your Reality
Often what we imagine in our minds doesn’t look possible in the light of day. 
If you discover a large gap between your vision of what you’d like to do and 
what you think you can do, you may feel inclined to stop in your tracks and 
change direction. 
Before you do that, take a look at the gap to identify the true cause of your 
discomfort. When you know what is standing between you and your ideal 
green job, you can begin to search for ways to eliminate the blocks that are in 
your way. There could be several reasons for the gap you see between where 
you are today and your green dream.
	
It’s no surprise that the strategies to bring your dream into reality take time 
and personal determination. Keep your goal in sight and celebrate your wins 
along the way. You may be surprised how opportunities open up for you as 
you take steps toward your green career goal. Knowing that you are taking the 
actions necessary to land your green career job brings hope and direction. 
Gaining more experience
To succeed in your target field, you may need to develop your skills, espe­
cially if your goal is to change careers. Although the prospect of getting expe­
rience may look daunting at first, don’t let that put your dream on hold. You 
can do this; it just takes a bit of strategy to put a plan in place. 
As soon as your new career goal comes into focus, begin looking at your situ­
ation to find ways to build out your resume. The usual catch-22 exists in the 
green economy. Employers want to hire people who already have experience. 
People who want to transition into the green economy don’t have the experi­
ence employers are looking for. 

62
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
The best strategy is to begin building your green experience base as soon as 
possible. Look for opportunities to develop skills in your current job through 
your job responsibilities, committee work, or company-sponsored training 
opportunities. Search for a volunteer opportunity that is in alignment with 
your goals or offer to work on a project as an independent contractor for a 
small business. Evaluate each opportunity to determine whether it will pro­
vide you with new skills and résumé-worthy experience. 
Getting more training
In some cases, you need more than just experience to make the leap to a new 
career. You may need to look at training opportunities or education to help 
you conquer the gap you see. Look for the best way to enhance the skills 
that are relevant and critical to your target career. What skills do you need 
to add? What’s the best way to gain those skills? What kind of skill-building 
activities work with your lifestyle?
Don’t limit yourself by thinking the only answer is a college or graduate 
degree. Expand your brainstorming to include online courses, hands-on 
internships, apprenticeships, a selection of hand-picked courses, or a cer­
tificate. Strive to find the solution that truly fits your needs. Chapter 16 has 
many more ideas on this topic. 
	
In the early stages of evaluating a new career you’re likely to base a number of 
your decisions on assumptions you’ve made about the industry, profession, 
and organizations in the field. As you determine where you want to focus your 
attention, your assumptions are a helpful tool — but as you begin making life-
changing choices about training and ultimately employment, it is critical that 
you move beyond assumption-driven decisions. 
As you assess the gaps in your training and how to fill them, you must begin 
talking with people in your chosen field. Those who work in the profession 
and industry have the best, most up-to-date information possible. 
	
✓	Use your network to connect with these individuals. Check out Chapter 
15 for ideas to build your green network. 
	
✓	Another valuable source of information about training requirements are 
professional and industry associations. Check out the Web sites of the 
associations that are most relevant to your goals (see the industry pro­
files in Chapter 7 through 13 for links to relevant assocations). You are 
likely to find overall information about the industry, as well as detailed 
information about the training required to succeed in the field. 

63
 Chapter 5: Playing to Your Strengths in the Green Careers Arena
Wrestling with the location of the work
Industries within the green economy tend to be clustered in certain areas of 
the country due to the availability of renewable energy resources such as 
wind, solar, or geothermal, or based on the location of existing industries 
that were a precursor to the green industry. If you don’t live in a hotbed of 
activity for your target industry, you have some decisions to make. 
To move or not to move is one key question you must to wrestle with. To 
wait or not to wait is the corollary to that question. If you wait a while before 
jumping into the green economy, will other options open up? Will your target 
industry open up in other areas, or in your area? To answer these questions 
you must delve into the industry to understand the trends and attempt to 
forecast the direction of the industry.
	
If your heart’s desire is to work in the wind industry, you most likely need 
to relocate to one of the wind corridors. Right now, most of the wind indus­
try activity (www.awea.org/projects/) is in the West Coast, New York, 
and central plains swooping from Texas up to Minnesota. If relocating is 
not appealing or feasible for your family right now, think outside the box as 
you consider your options. It’s possible the wind corridors will expand to 
include the East Coast (www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_maps.
asp) — would that work interest you? Small wind turbines that are appropri­
ate for personal homes and small businesses are showing promise. Is there 
enough wind in your immediate area to look to this side of the wind industry 
for employment? Another option would be to look into the manufacturing side 
of the wind industry, which is primarily located in the Midwest (scroll to the 
bottom of this Web page for the map of wind manufacturers, www.earth2tech.
com/maps). 
Feeling limited by family responsibilities
If you have young children at home or are caring for an ailing parent, you 
may not be able to take on your ideal career at this time. Your best strategy 
may be to take small steps toward your goal now in preparation for a time 
when your schedule is more flexible.
Explore simple ways you can make progress for now. Perhaps you can’t make 
the career move you’d like to make, but you can establish a strong network, 
do some reading, take an online course, or do some volunteering. Any action 
you take now puts you in a better position to make a move when you are 
ready. 

64
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
You may also want to look at your personal responsibilities to get a sense of 
when they may shift. If your children head to school in three years or your 
caretaking responsibilities will shift at a certain time, use that information to 
plot out a tentative timeline. Having a sense of your time horizon helps you 
stay focused as you prepare for a career change in the future.
Questioning your abilities
If others believe you have what it takes to achieve your vision, but you have 
your doubts, you may want to take another look at your abilities from a more 
objective perspective. Sometimes people get in the habit of believing they 
can’t do something when, in fact, they are fully capable of being successful.
Take an inventory of your accomplishments at work and in your life. Make 
note of the activities, projects, and accomplishments you feel proud of. Then 
ask friends and colleagues to e-mail you a list of your three biggest accom­
plishments and your three best strengths from their perspective. Choose 
people who care about you and whom you trust. If it’s uncomfortable to 
make this request, tell them you are doing an assignment for a career coun­
selor or career coach or because this book told you to. You may be pleas­
antly surprised at how willing they are to participate in this activity.
As you begin to receive responses, compare how your friends and colleagues 
view you and how you view yourself. Don’t discredit their views; take their 
perspectives as gifts of insight and perspective. Do what you can to begin to 
let this new view of yourself in as you move toward your green career.
Waiting for the green economy to catch up
You may also discover that the timing of your transition to a green career 
doesn’t hinge on your experience or education. In fact, your inability to move 
into a green job may have nothing to do with you at all. It’s entirely possible 
that your target green industry is not ready to hire someone with your skills 
and talents. 
	
If you long to work in the biofuels industry, creating fuel from algae, switch 
grass, or sawdust, you may be in just the right place and time if you are a 
scientist or technician. If, however, your dream job is marketing, sales, or pro­
duction manager, you may be out of luck, for the time being at least. At this 
point in time, the entire biofuels industry is in a research and development 
phase. Every company that exists in this industry is focusingall their time 
and resources on discovering a way to produce biofuels that is cost effective, 
efficient, and scalable. In other words, they are still searching for a viable way 
to produce the product they are in existence to provide. Until they find that 

65
 Chapter 5: Playing to Your Strengths in the Green Careers Arena
formula and know that they can produce the product in mass quantities, they 
have no business hiring production managers, marketing teams, or a sales 
force. They have nothing to produce, market, or sell. Yet.
If you find that you’ve arrived at the party a few months or years too early, 
acknowledge both your dream and the current state of your target industry 
and do at least some, if not all, of the following:
	
✓	Keep tracking your target industry. Watch for technological break­
throughs. Scan for opportunities. Being aware of your industry allows 
you to follow history in the making. You then know what the industry 
has tried, what has worked, and what hasn’t. Your detailed knowledge 
means that you are ready to step into any company and be productive 
from day one. 
	
✓	Gain related experience. Although you won’t be able to gain experience 
in your target industry, think about related industries that might give 
you experience in the distribution system your target industry is likely 
to use, help you build a network of contacts that will be valuable to a 
future employer from your target industry, or teach you about an analo­
gous technology or process. 
	
✓	Attend industry conferences. To identify job opportunities in related 
industries, you need to understand your target industry in as much 
detail as possible. Although reading blogs, newsletters, and industry 
association Web sites can help, attending a conference with profession­
als who are actively working in the industry is invaluable. 
Use the time you have wisely, from when you identify your target green 
industry to the time that industry is ready to hire you. By staying engaged, 
you position yourself ahead of all the others who gave up hope of ever find­
ing a job in the emerging industry. 
Claiming your dreams
You may be a bit discouraged by the amount of time and energy required to 
plug into the green career of your dreams. Well, don’t be. Stay connected to 
your passion and do what you must to move toward your dream.
The path may not always be straight. You may hit a few bumps along the 
way. You may even need to take a detour or two before you are able to enter 
your targeted green field. 
As long as you keep your goal in mind, each step you take is moving you closer 
to your dream. In the end, you may look back and discover that your path has 
led you to a slightly different, but equally interesting, destination. No harm. As 
long as you are excited about where you are headed and you feel that you can 
make a difference, your journey will be worth your investment.

Chapter 6
Setting Your Green Career Goals
In This Chapter
▶	Creating a picture of how you want to work
▶	Understanding where you like to work
▶	Defining your green career goal
▶	Stating your goal enthusiastically
▶	Making plans for next steps
You know you want a green career, and yet you aren’t sure how to 
describe what you have to offer. Knowing you want a green career is 
only the first step. Determining exactly where your skills, interests, experi­
ence, and education fit into the green economy is a more intricate part of the 
puzzle. After identifying your favorite interests in Chapter 4 and your favorite 
skills in Chapter 5, you’re now ready to explore the characteristics of the 
green organization you ultimately want to work for. 
Being able to clearly and confidently describe your green career goal is a 
crucial step in your quest. Toward the end of this chapter you pull together 
everything you’ve discovered to create a description of the kind of green 
work that’s the best fit for you.
When you’re able to share your goal in a crisp, clear sound bite, you have a 
powerful tool to guide your exploration, collect resources and referrals from 
your network, and land a job. 
Thinking Through How You Want to Work
As you consider your green career, you’re most likely focusing on what you 
want to do in your job and what green issues you want to resolve through 
your work. Although it’s critical to discover your career focus, there are sev­
eral other questions that deserve your attention at this point. 

68
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
The first is: How do you want to work? Most people don’t consider this ques­
tion because they assume that they are looking for a full-time position with 
benefits. In the emerging green economy, a full-time position may or may not 
be your first stop. Take some time to expand your vision of what’s possible in 
this section. 
	
As you work through the next few sections, keep your notebook or notes 
document at the ready. Write down your answers to the following inquiries. 
Having a written record of your answers makes it easier to see themes and 
connections. 
Looking beyond a full-time job
Although your vision of your next job is a full-time position, the economy and 
the industry you want to enter may not be able or ready to hire you in that 
capacity right now. Although it may bring a bit of discomfort to the surface, 
open yourself to a wider variety of work formats. Looking beyond full-time 
work allows you to say yes to a broader range of opportunities that cross 
your path.
As you read about work formats you may not have considered before, keep 
in mind that these options are likely to be short term. Think of them as step­
pingstones to your ultimate green career. As long as you make strategic 
decisions about which opportunities to accept, any and all of these options 
can help you prepare for your ultimate job by building your skills, enhancing 
your knowledge, building your network, and strengthening your resume.
If you’re committed to moving your career forward, don’t let the following 
opportunities pass you by:
	
✓	Contracting: The next best thing to a full-time job may be a green con­
tract position. In this arrangement you work full time for a specific period 
of time. Your pay may be higher than your usual pay rate, but you are 
responsible for covering your taxes and your benefits. Use your time 
under contract to gain as much insight as you can about the organiza­
tion’s industry and the unique elements of the business. You never know 
how the information you glean from this experience will help you land 
your next position. While in your contract position, leverage your time by 
building your network, strengthening your own skills, and enhancing your 
knowledge about the green/sustainable aspects of your work. 
	
✓	Consulting: If you have an appropriate skill set, you may be able to find 
green consulting jobs to keep you busy and help you develop additional 
skills for your target career. You need to spend some time upfront figur­
ing out how to differentiate your skills from others in your profession 

69
 Chapter 6: Setting Your Green Career Goals
and then marketing your services. The good news is that you are in con­
trol of your schedule. Depending on your workload, you may be able to 
incorporate some targeted volunteer work as well. Being out in the com­
munity is a great way to spread the word about your services and keep 
your eyes open for your next opportunity. 
	
✓	Working part time: If a green part-time position presents itself to you, 
and the work is right up your alley, take the job! The upside is that you 
still have time in your schedule to explore the green economy or further 
your job search. You also get an inside look at a green company in your 
chosen field. What an opportunity to test the waters. Is the profession 
what you thought it would be? Is this the right company for you? What 
do you need to do to improve your position? As you do your job, look 
for ways to demonstrate your value to the company, in dollars and cents 
if possible. You never know, you may just set yourself up with a full-time 
job in the process. 
	
✓	Interning: Green internships aren’t just for college students and new 
grads. Some internships are paid (probably not much), and some aren’t. 
If you have the opportunity, step out of your regular life and find an 
internship that gives you an entirely new experience. If you aren’t clear 
about what you want to do in the green economy, use your internship as 
an opportunity to explore and experience a broad range of issues.
	
✓	Volunteering: Taking a green volunteer position with a local nonprofit, 
community group, or start-up can prove to be a very valuable strategy. 
When you volunteer, your energy is up — you exude excitement, con­
fidence, and passion. These are the qualities that attract people to pay 
attention to you, whether they are a networking contact or a potential 
employer. 
	
	Jobnob (www.jobnob.com), a Bay Area organization committed to con­
necting job seekers and companies, sponsored an event that brought 
300 people to a San Francisco bar to volunteer for start-up companies. 
The deal was that the start-ups would buy the drinks, and the job seek­
ers would commit to working five hours a week as a volunteer. Jobnob 
was stunned by the popularity of their event and intends to have 
monthly events, using this same model. It will be fascinating to hear the 
success stories that come from these events! 
When approached about a position that doesn’t match your full-time vision, 
be open to finding a way to make it work. Be flexible. If necessary, find a cre­
ative way to piece together several opportunities to bring in the income you 
need. Remember, this is the opening you’ve been waiting for — a first step 
toward your green career. 
If you pass on these opportunities, you miss out on critical skill-building, 
network-enhancing experiences. In the end, saying no to opportunities that 
align with your ultimate green goal sets you back.

Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
Prospering with multiple streams 
of income
As you envision your future, you may also want to consider an approach to 
work that was quite common before the standard workday came into vogue 
as a result of the Industrial Revolution. In this approach, you create a com­
posite career that allows you to bring together a set of positions that fit your 
interests and your work style. 
With multiple sources of income, you become less dependent on any one 
company’s decisions. Your diversified work life feeds you in ways a single 
full-time job might not. Time is more fluid as you balance your responsibili­
ties and personal needs. 
	
Over time Grace created a composite career that enables her to use her tal­
ents in ways that match her personal and professional needs. In addition to a 
part-time position at a local, environmental nonprofit, Grace works on several 
consulting projects and gives presentations several times a month. The part-
time position provides a stable baseline income source, while her consulting 
and speaking allow her some flexibility. At certain times during the year she 
works more and brings in larger sums of money. As she nears the end of each 
project, she determines when to start her next contract. Being able to take a 
couple of weeks between projects helps her manage the rest of her life more 
effectively. 
If you want to explore the idea of having a composite career, create a descrip­
tion of how you want your professional life and your personal life to work. 
What’s most important to you: the freedom of time, stability of your money, 
a certain work schedule, or a certain kind of project? As you put your picture 
in place, be aware that your vision may shift and that you may need to find 
creative ways to fill in the gaps as you are building toward your ultimate 
plan. Each year or so, reflect on how your composite career is serving you 
and your needs. If need be, make adjustments by aligning with new opportu­
nities or renegotiating the arrangements you have in place. 
Being your own boss
You may also want to consider becoming self-employed. Although consulting 
is one obvious way to be your own boss, there are other options. With your 
skills and interests from Chapters 4 and 5 in mind, consider the kind of busi­
ness that would be best for you.
	
✓	Selling a product: In your industry of choice would it make sense to sell 
a particular product or collection of products? Perhaps you’d be inter­
ested in selling green building supplies, eco-friendly clothing, organic 
food, or personal wind turbines. 

71
 Chapter 6: Setting Your Green Career Goals
	
✓	Providing information: Another option is to offer a specialized form of 
information to your customers. You might want to create environmental 
impact surveys, green market research analysis, or industry trend analy­
sis for investments. 
	
✓	Performing a service: In some cases, your best option may be to iden­
tify a process you can market. Would you like to have a green printing 
company, a green dry cleaning company, a eco-friendly bed & breakfast, 
or an energy efficiency business? 
As you identify what you want to offer through a business, you also need to 
explore the best way to start your business. 
	
✓	Greening an existing business: If you already own a business, explore 
how you might green it. Another option is to purchase a local business 
that has the potential to become more sustainable. Instead of starting 
from scratch, you transform a working business into something greener. 
	
✓	Purchasing a franchise: If you’d feel more comfortable tapping into a busi­
ness that already works, consider purchasing a franchise. Currently there 
are several franchise opportunities that are completely green and many 
others that have a green element to their offering. The list of green fran-
chise options is likely to grow over time. If you want to explore your options, 
you might want to contact a company like Frannet (www.frannet.com) 
for support in making the right decision for you. Consulting and train­
ing from a company like this doesn’t cost you anything; the company 
receives payment if and only if you purchase a franchise. 
	
✓	Starting a green business from the ground up: Another option is to 
start your own green business. To succeed, you must come up with your 
business idea, figure out the best way to offer your product or service, 
choose your business name, establish your branding, develop your mar­
keting plan, secure funding — and go for it!
Taking over an existing business or starting a new business require thought 
and planning. Before you take the leap, use the chapters in this book to 
clarify your direction. When you are confident you are on the right path, look 
to other resources to build your business. Check out Green Business Practices 
For Dummies by Lisa Swallow (Wiley) and Small Business For Dummies by Eric 
Tyson and Jim Schell (Wiley).
Defining the Work Setting 
That Fits Your Life 
Where you work impacts your sense of satisfaction and your well-being. If 
you’re going to spend 40+ hours a week in a job, don’t you want to find the 
kind of job that’s going to be a good fit for you and your life? The best way to 

72
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
uncover where you fit is to look to your past experience for clues about what 
you liked and what you didn’t like about where you worked. You can also tap 
into your dreams and desires to bring additional clues to light. 
Uncovering where you feel at home
Discovering the qualities of the organization where you feel comfortable can 
be a very valuable source of information when you begin to consider your 
career options. Use the following categories to trigger your thoughts about 
how to describe the kind of company you enjoy working for. 
	
✓	Kind of organization: Working for a nonprofit, educational institution, 
or governmental agency is likely to be a different experience than work­
ing for a start-up or a private company. Working for a small company, 
whether it is housed in a small office space, home based, or virtual has 
an even different feel to it. Based on your previous work experience, 
what setting is the best fit for you? 
	
✓	Size: Do you have a sense of the size of the organization you want to be 
a part of? Are you more comfortable in a mega-organization or a small 
outfit where you know all the players? Do you like to work in an organi­
zation that has multiple branches or one location? 
	
✓	Reach: Another characteristic to consider is the reach of the company. 
Are you drawn to work with an organization that focuses on making an 
impact on your local community or on the world? Is your desire to make 
a difference in your region or in your country as a whole?
	
✓	Purpose: Do you have a preference for the overall purpose of the orga­
nization that hires you? Do you see yourself working for a manufacturer, 
a service provider, a research institution, a retail or wholesale organiza­
tion, an entertainment company, or a provider of information?
As you look at the combination of company qualities you’ve selected, what 
kind of organization comes to mind? You may see one obvious answer or sev­
eral combinations that might work for you. The characteristics that end up 
on your list can help you narrow your focus within an particular industry or 
profession. 
	
Patrick is intrigued by all facets of the green building industry, from design to 
new building construction, building supplies, and retrofitting opportunities. 
At the moment he’s a bit overwhelmed by all the options before him. As he 
answers the questions in this section, he realizes he’s happiest when he works 
for small, private companies with a regional reach that provide a service. 
With this information in mind, he’s able to narrow his focus to working for a 
regional construction firm or an energy audit company that services a specific 
region. Although he’s fascinated by the building supply industry, he knows 
working for a large, multinational manufacturing company or a national ser­
vice provider is not for him. 

73
 Chapter 6: Setting Your Green Career Goals
Discerning your most productive 
work environment
As you consider your future career direction, take some time to think 
through the work environment that is most productive for you. Sure, you 
could just take whatever work setting comes your way. You would survive, 
but would you thrive? 
Discovering and claiming the work environment that is best for you provides 
you with valuable clues about your future career. If you know you prefer to 
work out on the open road, a job sitting a cubicle five days a week might do 
you in. 
Use the following list to pinpoint the kind of work setting you enjoy most. If 
a combination of several settings appeals to you, make note of that. If you 
aren’t quite sure what you want, think back over the jobs you’ve held to 
recall the work stations that worked well for you:
	
✓	Cubicle work environment with a network of offices within close proximity.
	
✓	A small office area with a few desks in a large open space and perhaps 
an office or two off the main room
	
✓	Being on the road with a local territory 
	
✓	Being on the road with a territory that spans an entire region 
	
✓	A home office with up-to-date equipment that allows you to work virtually
	
✓	Being outside with fresh air, the wind, and the elements 
Stay attuned to your needs. Your desired work setting may change in 
response to lifestyle changes or changes in your personal needs.. 
Identifying Your Role within 
the Green Economy
Having collected a variety of clues about how you want to work and where 
you want to work, it’s time to combine what you know to discover your green 
career options. To complete this section, have your notebook available with 
your notes from Chapters 4 and 5 and the first few sections of this chapter. 
	
✓	Focus of your work: As you reflect on your ten favorite interests, your 
ten favorite skills, and the career ideas you brainstormed in Chapter 5, 
what ideas float to the top? At this moment, what two or three green 

74
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
career ideas are most intriguing to you? You don’t have to have com­
plete clarity at this point. Rely on your intuition and your gut to tell you 
which areas you want to explore in more depth. 
	
✓	Form of work: Next, take a stab at describing the form of work you want. 
Do you want a full-time job, a composite career, or a part-time position? 
Pull together a list of all the options that could work for you in the short 
term and the long term. For example, you might be willing to take a vol­
unteer position or a short-term project to break into a field and then aim 
for a full-time position or a consulting project. 
	
✓	Where you work: Now consider the kind of organization you want to 
work for. Pull out the characteristics that are most important to you in 
terms of the kind, the size, the reach, and the purpose of the organization.
	
✓	Your work setting: And finally, record what you know about your favor­
ite work setting. If you want to work outside or you like to be on the 
road, this is the place to make that declaration. Knowing you function 
best when working at home or in a structured environment can be a cru­
cial clue as you pinpoint your green career options. 
Don’t be alarmed if your green career idea seems to make a U-turn at times. 
If you change direction, it may be because you discovered, after doing some 
research, that your original target industry doesn’t quite match your inter­
ests or needs after all or that the industry itself is changing dramatically. 
	
Before you jump into action to figure out how to narrow down your focus, 
continue on with this chapter to create a working statement of your goal. This 
goal keeps you focused no matter what your next move is. 
Creating a Clear Statement of Your Goal
Now it’s time to turn your current green career idea into a clear statement of 
where you are heading with your green career. As you refine your statement, 
it will guide you in your research, networking, and job search activities. 
	
You may or may not have enough information and knowledge about your 
target industry to be able to develop a full statement of your green career 
goal at this time. But you have to start somewhere. Do the best you can with 
what you know right now. You can always revise and update later. Your green 
career goal is meant to be a work in progress. During the early stages of your 
quest, you may update your statement on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. 
That’s perfect. As you gain more clarity about your interests, the industry, and 
your direction, your statement naturally evolves.

75
 Chapter 6: Setting Your Green Career Goals
Defining your ultimate green career goal 
Based on the ideas you are considering, how might you describe your ulti­
mate career goal? Perhaps you have a sense of the industry you want to work 
in. Or you may know what function you want to fulfill for a green organiza­
tion. You may even dream of working for a particular organization. 
Starting with what you know, how might you fill in this question?
I want to ________________________________________________. 
	
✓	I want to work in the green building industry helping homeowners 
become more energy efficient. 
	
✓	I want to be actively involved in creating policies that help the country 
in the transition to renewable energy. 
	
✓	I want to persuade businesses to take actions that are more sustainable. 
	
✓	I want to help restore wildlife areas. 
Although your statements may feel incredibly vague at first, stick with the 
process. Draft a handful of these sentences to get your creative juices flow­
ing. You may be surprised with what comes to you in the process. 
Choose your two favorite ultimate green career goals and find a way to keep 
the statements in front of you. Put a sticky note on your computer, include it 
in your calendar, put it in your wallet, or place it on your bathroom mirror. 
The more you make this a part of your daily thoughts, the more it will evolve. 
As you consider your goal and use it to guide your networking and your 
research efforts, new thoughts and ideas will come to mind. Incorporate your 
new discoveries into your statement. 
Spelling out your short-term career goal
If you already know you won’t be moving right into your dream green career, 
create a statement to reflect your short-term career goal. The more specific 
and detailed you can be about your immediate career goal, the more your 
network will be able to help you find the connections, resources, and con­
tacts you need to find your next job. 

76
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
	
As you consider your options for your next position, be as strategic as possi­
ble. Do as much research as you can to understand your ultimate career goal 
so you recognize the skills and qualities required in that career. Then look at 
your current options to determine which position is the best move for you 
and your future career. 
	
✓	I want to work as a ___________________ in the ________________ industry.
	
✓	I want to work as a __________________ for ___________________ company. 
	
✓	I want to use my background in _______________ to help 
_______________ industry solve _________________ problem. 
	
✓	I want to use my background in _______________ to help 
_______________ company solve ________________ problem.
	
✓	I want to work as a bookkeeper in the solar industry. (By leveraging 
your bookkeeping skills, an established expertise, you gain access to an 
industry you want to find out more about.)
	
✓	I want to work as a marketing specialist in XYZ company. (By working as 
a marketing specialist, you strengthen a skill you know you want to use 
in the green economy in the future.) 
	
✓	I want to use my background in sales to help the energy efficiency indus­
try convert more leads into paying clients. (By leveraging your sales expe­
rience in another field, you can help your target industry reach their sales 
goals while you gain resume-worthy experience in the process.)
	
✓	I want to use my background in design to help ABC Construction save 
time and add a new income stream to their business. (By leveraging 
your previous design experience, you can state very clearly and con­
cisely how you would be a valuable asset to a particular company.) 
Don’t be surprised if your short-term goal continues to evolve as you launch 
your job search. As you uncover information about your local economy, local 
industry challenge and opportunities, and your ability to help companies and 
organizations solve problems, you can tweak your statement to better reflect 
your value to organizations or companies who are most likely to hire you. To 
gain more insights about this process, see Chapter 17. 
Pinpointing your next step goals 
If you’ve just begun your search for your ideal green career, and you don’t 
need to find a job immediately, you may want to generate a set of goal state­
ments you can use to focus your own exploration. As you research your 
target industry, having a clear picture in mind of the information you need to 
move forward helps you use your time more effectively. 
Use the following sample goals to create your own personal set of goal state­
ments. If you like, start with one goal and then create your next goal when 

77
 Chapter 6: Setting Your Green Career Goals
you are ready to take that action. Or create a series of goal statements to 
have at the ready as you proceed. These goals statements provide you with 
the intentions you need to stay focused on your exploration. 
	
✓	I am researching __________________ industry to get an overview, under­
stand the current trends, and discover future forecasts.
	
✓	I am exploring ways to enhance my skills and knowledge about the topic 
of ______________________________.
	
✓	I am searching for networking venues that will allow me to meet 
and interact with people from _________________ industry or 
_____________________ profession.
	
✓	I am looking for volunteer opportunities that will prepare me to work in 
the _______________________ industry.
	
✓	I would like to build my network of contacts in the ____________________ 
profession.
See Chapter 14 to discover the best way to use these next-step goal state­
ments to focus your research. Then when you have a general understanding 
of your target industry, use your goal statements to focus your networking 
with those who know about your target field. Chapter 15 spells out the do’s 
and don’ts of networking.
Asserting Your Green Career Goal with 
Confidence, Clarity, and Excitement
How you talk about your employment goals is the best indicator of your read­
iness to be hired. Your networking contacts and potential employers pick up 
clues about your credibility, passion, and clarity from your description of 
your desired career direction. 
Use the following guidelines to discover how to share your green career goal 
in ways that motivate your networking contacts and potential employers:
	
✓	State your networking or employment goal clearly and concisely in 
one or two sentences. 
	
	Jody had a golden opportunity while having lunch with a member of 
her network. As the conversation started, Jody launched into a descrip­
tion of her green career goals. Unfortunately, she took 20 minutes to 
explain what she was looking for in a green career. There was no rhyme 
or reason to her explanation — in fact, she repeated herself a number 
of times without ever clearly stating her goal. Then Jody asked her col­
league what he thought she could do in the green economy with her 
background. 

78
Part II: Finding Your Green Focus 
	
	 This one-sided conversation told her colleague several critical things. 
	
1.	Jody wasn’t at all clear about her direction. He didn’t understand 
her goal well enough to offer suggestions or referrals. 
	
2.	She had not done her own homework prior to the meeting. In fact, 
she was asking him to do her homework for her. 
	
3.	He wouldn’t be comfortable referring Jody to a company even if he 
knew of one that was hiring. 
	
	In a similar situation, Jane handles the conversation quite differently. 
Instead of focusing on her confusion and the ups and downs of her journey 
thus far, Jane focuses on what she does know about her desired direction. 
Although she’s not yet clear about what role she’d play in this industry, she 
did take the time to research the industry before the meeting. During lunch, 
Jane asks her colleague questions that help her identify new resources, con­
tacts, and segments of the industry she wants to explore. 
	
1.	Jane’s colleague is in a much better position to help. He under­
stand where Jane is and, more important, what support she needs. 
	
2.	She impressed him with the research she’d already done.
	
3.	When she’s ready, he’d be happy to refer her to key contacts in the 
field. 
	
✓	State your employment goals with confidence. In addition to stating 
your goals clearly and concisely, you also want to infuse your comments 
with a sense of confidence and excitement about your direction. 
	
	If you’re just going through the motions because you have to get a job, 
any job, your lack of connection with your goal will shine through loud 
and clear to your networking contacts and even to potential employers. 
If your network picks up that your heart isn’t in the game, they can’t in 
good conscience pitch you to their own networks. 
	
✓	Share your sense of conviction and passion as you talk about your 
employment goals. Your network will pick up on your excitement and 
refer you with more enthusiasm and commitment.
	
	Shirley entered the networking event with a clear statement of what she 
was looking for. She felt confident that her current goal was a good fit 
for her skills. Unfortunately, as she spoke to various people around the 
room, they all noticed one thing: Shirley had no spark, no internal fire, 
as she described her goal. Her network got the facts clearly and knew 
she’d technically be a good candidate for the position she was going 
after, but they didn’t sense any passion coming from Shirley. 
	
	When Samantha shared her current green career goal, she was fully 
alive. Her eyes sparkled, her voice expressed her passion about her 
future career, and she was full of energy as she spoke. 
	
	Although both women might be referred to contacts and potential job 
openings, Samantha’s network is more likely to give an enthusiastic, 
glowing introduction than Shirley’s network. 

79
 Chapter 6: Setting Your Green Career Goals
	
If you don’t feel an authentic spark of passion regarding your green career 
focus, ask yourself if you are heading in the right direction. It’s nearly impossi­
ble to fake this level of connection with your goal. 
If you’re focused on a particular direction because you think it’s the only 
option open to you, take another look at your options. Revisit Chapters 4 
and 5 to reconnect with your passions. Instead of focusing on your next step, 
think bigger. If you could do anything, what would that be? Although you may 
not be able to land your ideal job right now, knowing where you’re going will 
help you make better short-term decisions about your next job. 
When you can connect the dots and see that your next job is positioning you 
for your ideal green career, you will naturally exude the passion you need 
to show to engage your network in your job search. You may even find that 
opportunities open up around your ideal green career when you least expect it. 
Planning Your Next Steps
With your collection of green career goals, short-term career goals, and your 
next-step goal statements in hand, along with information about how to share 
your goals most effectively, it’s time to put your goals to good use.
No matter where you are in your quest for your green career, your next step 
is to research your career options. Your goal is to familiarize yourself with 
your target industry to discover as much as you can about the field, the 
trends, the opportunities, and the challenges. You can begin your explora­
tion by reviewing Chapters 7 through 13 to gain more knowledge about your 
target industry or perhaps to discover industries you didn’t know were 
green. Use the following list to determine which chapters you want to review:
	
✓	Interested in environmental sciences? Take a look at Chapter 7. 
	
✓	Attracted by natural resource management? Investigate Chapter 8.
	
✓	Fascinated by renewable energy sources? Check out Chapter 9.
	
✓	Engaged by energy efficiency and sustainability? Explore Chapter 10.
	
✓	Dedicated to building a strong foundation for the green economy? Delve 
into Chapter 11.
	
✓	Intrigued by inspiring others to go green? Examine Chapter 12.
	
✓	Motivated to provide green services? Consider Chapter 13.
After you review the industries of interest to you, proceed to Chapter 14 to 
discover the steps to deepening your exploration and Chapter 15 to find out 
the best way to network in the green economy.

Jobs in Caring for the Earth 
In This Chapter
▶	Using sciences to explore the impact of global warming
▶	Applying scientific know-how to turn environmental issues around
▶	Working as part of a team to evaluate environmental impact
W
hen scientists look at the planet, they see four interwoven spheres: 
the lithosphere (the outer surface), the hydrosphere (all forms of 
water on the planet), the atmosphere (the gases surrounding the planet), 
and the biosphere (the global ecosystem where life thrives). This chapter 
includes profiles of the sciences and the -ologies that focus on these aspects 
of the Earth.
The most obvious characteristic of this set of profiles is that they are inter­
related with no clear demarcations between them. As it turns out, this char­
acteristic mirrors the interrelated systems that make up the Earth. Just as it 
is nearly impossible to talk about a cheetah without mentioning its habitat, 
prey, and predators (humans), it is just as difficult to talk about zoology with­
out also touching on conservation ecology and habitat restoration. 
The recent American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included the 
largest infusion of funds ever for basic research projects, instrumentation, 
and enhancements to research and development facilities. Overall, $151.1 bil­
lion is being invested in research and development at the federal level. With 
many departments receiving more funds than originally requested, the basic 
sciences at government laboratories and universities are likely to benefit. For 
a description of the funds allocation prepared by the American Association 
for the Advancement of Science see www.aaas.org/spp/rd. 
As you explore the sciences described in this chapter, keep three things in 
mind. 
	
✓	First, each of these topics is a basic science in which the focus is to 
understand a portion of the Earth’s systems. The knowledge gained 
through this research is essential to our understanding of global warm­
ing and its impact on the planet as a whole and on the species that cur­
rently inhabit the Earth. 

84
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
	
✓	Second, nearly all these specialties have a sub-discipline that takes the 
same knowledge and applies it to real-world problems. Some of the real-
world applications appear in this chapter, and others become evident in 
Chapter 8. 
	
✓	Third, you are likely to see the same or similar job titles appearing in pro­
files within environmental science and natural resource management. 
To help you develop a solid grasp of this vast topic, I use the four spheres as the 
starting point for organizing this chapter. From there, I highlight a few additional 
topics as they are particularly relevant to issues of global warming and climate 
change. In some profiles — biology, for example — I keep the focus squarely on 
environmental issues rather than all the issues addressed by biology.
Environmental Science
Environmental science is an interdisciplinary study of the natural environ­
ment from a systems point of view. Often a team of scientists from different 
fields work together to assess the impact of human actions on the land and 
water systems of a particular region, with the goal of creating strategies 
to restore the ecosystem. In many cases the team prepares and presents 
an Environmental Impact Statement (also called an Environmental Impact 
Report (EIR) or Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)) to the local, 
regional, or national government to describe the potential impact of a project 
on the surrounding environment.
Environmental scientists also work with planners, designers, and other officials 
to address a wide range of applied issues such as water quality, groundwater 
contamination, soil contamination, waste management, air pollution, noise pol­
lution, natural resource management, biodiversity, conservation, and climate 
change. In addressing these multifaceted issues, environmental science teams 
may also include experts on economics, law, and social sciences. 
Typically, the teams that perform these assessments and prepare the impact 
reports pull in scientists from a variety of disciplines. The profiles that follow 
highlight the sciences that are most likely to be included in an environmental 
science assessment. These same sciences are also likely to study the issues 
that may arise if climate change is not reversed. 
Atmospheric Sciences
According to the American Meteorological Society, meteorologists, also 
known as atmospheric scientists, use “scientific principles to explain, under­
stand, observe, or forecast the earth’s atmospheric phenomena and/or how 
the atmosphere affects the earth and life on the planet.” 

85
 Chapter 7: Jobs in Caring for the Earth 
Two specialties within atmospheric science are critical to understanding 
global warming and its effects. 
	
✓	Climatologists study long-term climate variations by looking at past 
weather data and using complex computer models and datasets to proj­
ect how various factors such as greenhouse gases, volcanic activity, and 
solar flares impact our climate. Climate data is used by architects, land 
use planners, and industries that are influenced by weather events such 
as agriculture and insurance companies. 
	
✓	Environmental meteorologists use their expertise to study and evaluate 
environmental problems, including climate change, air contaminants, 
greenhouse gas emissions, fresh water shortages, droughts, and ozone 
depletion. Environmental meteorologists may be called upon to conduct 
environmental assessments and prepare environmental impact reports 
on their findings. 
Industry’s current status 
In a transition document for the new Administration and Congress at the end 
of 2008 (www.ucar.edu/td), several earth-centric organizations noted that 
more than 75 percent of the world’s natural disasters are triggered in some 
way by weather events from hurricanes, flooding, and tornadoes; to fires, 
droughts, and severe winter storms. As the climate shifts due to global warm­
ing, weather-related disasters are likely to become more intense, cause far 
more damage, and cost more for recovery. 
Furthermore, industries that are highly sensitive to weather and climate 
events contribute more than 25 percent of the U.S. gross national product. If 
these industries are damaged or taken offline temporarily, the entire econ­
omy will feel the effects. 
Although atmospheric scientists and climatologists have been studying and 
tracking issues related to these natural disasters for several decades, budget 
cuts and reduced grant money over the years have hindered their ability 
to upgrade their systems, programs, and technology. Although large-scale 
modeling has provided broad-brush results, scientists have not had enough 
detailed information to assess the local and regional impact of weather-
related phenomena. 
Rating
Atmospheric science is a mature science. Advancing technology is allowing 
the industry to gain more insights, especially at the regional and local levels.

86
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
Future trends (and caveats)
Atmospheric scientists and climatologists should be on the front lines when 
it comes to research on global warming and climate change. Their knowl­
edge, skills, and technology have played and will continue to play a critical 
role in our understanding of climate change and global warming. Research 
results are likely to provide insights to help us mitigate the effects of higher 
temperatures and changing climate patterns on the Earth.
To fulfill this mission, scientists are clear that they need support from the 
government in the following ways (www.ucar.edu/td/transition.pdf). 
	
✓	Scientists must have the equipment, both satellite and ground instru­
ments, to observe conditions on the Earth. Funding is needed to bring 
the existing observation system up to current standards.
	
✓	More computer power is needed to process data for research projects, 
predictions, and other applications. 
	
✓	Research and computer modeling projects must be undertaken at a 
much finer scale to provide regional results for decision makers. 
	
✓	Society as a whole must become more literate when it comes to climate 
issues and the forces that influence our planet. Education and training 
programs that promote climate literacy are critical. One organization has 
already created an ebook on climate literacy: www.climatescience.
gov/Library/Literacy/default.php. See Chapter 12 for more on

Biology
Biology is the study of living organisms to determine their structure and func­
tion, how they grow, their origins and evolution, and their classification and 
distribution on the planet. The specialties in biology are determined by the 
kind of organism being studied. 
	
✓	Microbiologists examine microorganisms.
	
✓	Botanists study plants.
	
✓	Zoologists research animals.
The focus of study is generally based on the scale and the method used to 
research the target organism. Biochemistry, molecular biology, and cellular 
biology focus on the chemical reactions, systems of molecules, and cellular 
structures found in organisms. Physiology pinpoints the functions of tissues 
and organ systems. Ecology looks at the interactions between organisms and 
their environment. (Also see the section “Ecology” later in this chapter.)
Industry’s current status 
For much of the 1900s, biological research was compartmentalized according 
to sub-disciplines, with little discussion or exchange of ideas. In the 1990s the 
field began to move toward an integrative biology, which takes multiple per­
spectives and data into account. This transition to a more integrative science 
continues as it becomes clear that the complex questions of the day require 
a collaborative approach to research and problem solving.

Although all disciplines within biology contribute to our knowledge of the 
natural world, several disciplines are likely to play a bigger role in studying and 
combating climate change. Scientists who study particular animals — such as 
entomologists (insects), ethologists (animal behavior), herpetologists (reptiles 
and amphibians), ichthyologists (fish), mammalogists (mammals), and orni­
thologists (birds) — provide invaluable information about the state of these 
populations as the climate changes. Other biologists who study the natural 
world as a whole give us a broader, more integrated view of the situation. (See 
the later section, “Ecology,” for a discussion of this discipline.)
Rating
Biology is a mature science that is extending its reach into a variety of real-
world applications. 
Future trends (and caveats) 
Biologists are contributing their knowledge and expertise to discussions that 
are unfolding in politics, policy, and economics. It is critical that new policies 
and programs designed to resolve various environmental problems be based 
on a solid scientific foundation. 
Those with a mathematical background are applying their biological knowledge 
to solve environmental problems through mathematical applications such as 
modeling. This technological application allows scientists to uncover trends and 
findings much more quickly and efficiently than through observation alone.
Biomimicry is an emerging discipline that looks to nature’s design and pro­
cesses to find sustainable solutions to problems in the built environment. 
When designers, architects, engineers, and builders come together to design 
an element of the man-made environment sing biomimicry, biologists, ecolo­
gists, and other scientists join the conversation. After defining the problem, 
the entire team then looks to the natural world to discover how nature has 
solved the same problem in a sustainable manner. With natural models in 
mind, the team then looks for ways to replicate what nature has accom­
plished. Biomimicry solutions are innovative, elegant, and often more sim­
plistic than man-made solutions.

Environmental chemistry versus green chemistry
As you explore the various environmental 
industries, you are likely to come across refer­
ences to environmental chemistry and green 
or sustainable chemistry. At first glance, these 
two terms may seem to refer to the same field; 
however, they are actually two distinct special­
ties within chemistry. 
	✓	Environmental chemistry strives to under­
stand the chemicals and chemical reac­
tions that take place in nature. By first 
understanding the natural concentrations 
and effects of chemicals in the environ­
ment, scientists can then discern the 
impact human activities have on the natural 
world. In addition, environmental chemists 
research what happens to the chemicals 
that are a part of the products we use in 
our daily lives. In some cases they may 
discover chemicals that interact within the 
natural environment to create unforeseen 
toxic results. Environmental chemists may 
also apply their knowledge to create solu­
tions to remediate toxic conditions such as 
water pollution and soil contamination. 
	✓	Green chemistry is used to eliminate pollut­
ants by designing products and processes 
that minimize the use and creation of haz­
ardous materials. Green chemistry plays a 
role at every stage of a product’s life cycle, 
from design and manufacturing through use 
and disposal. As green chemistry is used 
more frequently, real-world environmental

Ecology 
Within ecology, scientists study populations of organisms and how those 
organisms interact with each other and with their physical environment. 
To put this in context, biology is the study of individual organisms from the 
molecular and cellular level, to physical systems such as tissues and organs, 
and to the entire individual (see the earlier “Biology” section). Ecology 
focuses on the study of the individual organism, populations of like organ­
isms, and the ecosystem the organisms live within. 
The ecosystem is the primary unit of investigation for ecologists. Think 
of an ecosystem as a collection of organisms that share the same habitat. 
Understanding how the organisms within an ecosystem function and interact 
provides valuable information about the interdependencies and environmen­
tal needs of the organisms under study. 
As an applied science, ecology allows scientists to understand the impact 
of changing environments on organisms and the best ways to conserve and 
restore the environment to support the ecosystem. The successful manage­
ment of natural resources such as forests, fish, and wildlife depends on 
sound ecological research (see Chapter 8 for natural resource management 
profiles). In addition, ecological science contributes to a wide range of envi­
ronmental issues, such as ecological restoration, global climate change, 
reduced biodiversity, habitat destruction, and extinction. 
Although it’s important to maintain viable ecosystems for wildlife and for our 
pleasure, keeping the earth in a thriving state is essential to our own well-
being. Thriving ecosystems perform essential services that we depend on, 
including clean air, clean water, food, clothing, fuel, and lumber products. In 
addition, intact ecosystems regulate floodwaters and keep lands fertile and 
crops pollinated. Many believe that understanding the true monetary value 
problems such as hazardous waste, energy 
consumption, pollution, health issues, and 
damage from raw materials extraction will 
be addressed upfront through innovation. 
Both fields are likely to grow as environmen­
tal issues gain status. Whether your focus is 
understanding the impact of chemicals, cre­
ating remediation solutions, or redesigning 
products and systems to remove pollution, 
you are likely to have an opportunity to make a 
difference.

of these ecological services would bring our economic system into better bal­
ance with the needs of the planet. (See the description of natural capitalism 
in Chapter 2.)
Ecology is a multi-faceted discipline. Each ecological project is defined by 
a number of factors, including the complexity or scope of interdependen­
cies, the organism, biome, climate, scale, or phenomenon being studied, 
and the technique used for research. (For more details, see http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_basic_ecology_topics.) 
Furthermore, scientists are guided by the following approaches, depending 
on the purpose of their work: 
	
✓	Systems ecology focuses on the influence of humans on ecosystems.
	
✓	Applied ecology applies ecological principles to real-world environmen­
tal problems.
	
✓	Conservation ecology is dedicated to reducing the risk of extinction.
	
✓	Restoration ecology uncovers what’s needed to repair damaged 
ecosystems. 
	
✓	Population ecology is the study of populations of organisms, including 
how they increase and go extinct.
	
✓	Environmental biology studies the natural world, as a whole or in a 
particular area, especially as affected by human activity.
Industry’s current status 
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has several programs in motion 
that incorporate ecology into their planning and programming. 
	
✓	In 2008 the EPA released an interactive Report of the Environment that 
discusses the nation’s air, water, land, human health, and ecological 
conditions. The agency’s goal is to track this data over time to create 
longitudinal trends, which will allow it to compare the conditions at one 
point in time with conditions at another point in time. This data pro­
vides the EPA with objective indicators about the state of the environ­
ment that it can use to develop future projects. The first edition of the 
report highlighted gaps in data reporting that must be resolved before 
viable conclusions can be drawn. From www.epa.gov/igateway you 
can also access other reports such as the Air Trends Online and the 
Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. 
	
✓	The Ecosystem Services Research Program is a five-year project to 
determine the full value of the services — such as clean water, clean air, 
land stability — that ecosystems provide. With this knowledge, the EPA, 
policymakers, and resource managers will be able to make better deci­
sions about programs and projects that protect and enhance ecosystem

Ecology is a mature industry where the focus of this industry is defined and 
known. Several subsets of the field are emerging and growing. The systems 
perspective of ecologists is likely to be sought after as more companies, orga­
nizations, and communities search for ways to become more sustainable. 
Future trends (and caveats) 
The Climate Change Science Program (CCSP), the interagency organization 
responsible for federal climate research, has indicated that its current moni­
toring systems are not adequate to perform the level of observations needed 
to track changes from climate change. Scientists believe it is important to 
understand how climate change impacts the distribution and population of 
animal and plant species, how the ecosystems are being disturbed by climate 
change, and how the changes in climate are impacting nutrients in the eco­
system. Although progress has been slow, setting up this monitoring system 
is one of the CCSP’s top priorities. 
In a pure sense, ecology is a scientific study rather than an industry. That 
said, more and more instances of applied ecology are appearing within ecol­
ogy and in the related disciplines. This trend is likely to continue as sustain­
ability and systems thinking take hold. 
In the design world, several industries are emerging that blend ecological 
principles with aspects of the built environment. Although the names seem 
similar, each specialty has its own focus and opportunities.
	
✓	Ecological design calls upon designers to bring ecological principles into 
the design projects to conserve energy, reduce toxins, and minimize waste.
	
✓	Ecological engineering integrates the two fields of ecology and engi­
neering to design, monitor, restore, and construct aquatic and land-
based ecosystems in a way that benefits humans and the environment. 
Applications include creating ecosystems to handle storm water in 
urban areas or restore community forests or wetland areas. 
	
✓	Industrial ecology incorporates ecological principles into the techno­
logical world of manufacturing. The goal within this sub-discipline is to 
create industrial systems that function much like a natural ecosystem. 
(See Chapter 10 for more information on manufacturing.)

Geosciences 
Geosciences, also known as earth sciences, is an umbrella term for all the sci­
ences that are devoted to studying the planet. Four key disciplines are used 
in this study, from physics and chemistry to biology and mathematics. 

94
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
Typically geosciences are divided into four fields: 
	
✓	Geography is the study of earth, including human geography, which 
refers to the built environment, and physical geography, which consists 
of the natural environment. A new focus is environmental geography, 
which looks at the interactions between humans and the environment. 
The focus of study is understanding how the environment is created, 
managed, and used.
	
✓	Geology is the study of the physical properties of the solid and liquid 
materials that make up the Earth, their history, and the processes that 
create and change them. Often this field is involved in mineral and 
hydrocarbon extraction, as well as using the physical aspects of the 
planet to understand past climates. 
	
✓	Geophysics looks at the entire Earth as a whole. Using quantitative 
instruments and the principles of physics, geophysicists explore various 
parts of the Earth, from the core to tectonic plates. Such observations 
are used to identify petroleum reservoirs, mineral deposits, and ground­
water sources. 
	
✓	Geodesy is a branch of applied mathematics that specializes in measur­
ing the Earth to determine its shape and size. 
According to the American Geological Institute, the field of geosciences is dif­
ficult to define because different organizations use different systems to cat­
egorize the various elements of the field. For a detailed look at the field, see 
www.agiweb.org/workforce/reports/2009-AppendixA.pdf.
Industry’s current status 
The geosciences industry evaluates its status by measuring several key 
economic metrics, including funding, commodities, gross domestic prod­
uct, productive activity, and market capitalization. Although the industry 
has experienced steady growth over the past decade, some changes have 
occurred due to the recent economic downturn. 
Although geosciences contribute to the overall economy in a number of sig­
nificant ways, many of these contributions aren’t necessarily green — oil and 
gas production and mining, for example. Nevertheless, a few areas that have 
the potential to be green include environmental remediation, waste manage­
ment, utilities, professional services, and general industry. 
For an in-depth look at the status of the industry, refer to the American 
Geological Institute’s 2009 Status of the Geosciences Workforce (www.
agiweb.org/workforce/reports/2009-StatusReportSummary.pdf).

Rating
Geosciences is a mature industry with the potential for growth in areas that 
address climate change.
Future trends (and caveats) 
The geosciences industry is facing a critical time as the workforce ages 
and the number of new scientists and engineers declines. Referred to 
as the “Great Crew Change,” this challenge concerns those tracking the 
long-term status of this industry. Read www.agiweb.org/workforce/
reports/2009-StatusReportSummary.pdf for an overview of employ­
ment trends in this field.
To help geosciences and all the sciences stay competitive, the federal gov­
ernment has several programs to encourage students of all ages to become 
interested, involved, and competent in scientific endeavors: 
	
✓	The American Competitiveness Initiative (ACI) provides federal funds 
toward research and education in the physical sciences. First mentioned 
by President Bush in his State of the Union Address in 2006, this initia­
tive runs for ten years. 
	
✓	The America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully 
Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act signed 
into law by President Bush in 2007 focuses on improving education in 
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).
	
✓	The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 contributes $5.2 
billion to several organizations committed to doing the work of these 
initiatives, aligning their budgets with the original vision. 
While the industry is contending with negative workforce trends, it also faces 
considerable changes in the focus of the work done by geoscientists. Two fac­
tors are contributing to this shift. First, oil and gas reserves are likely to be 
more difficult to find as supplies dwindle. To keep up with demand and produc­
tion goals, geoscientists will turn to technology to help them identify reserves 
and create new methods to extract energy from these new areas. Second, as 
the push toward more environmentally sustainable energy sources heats up, 
geoscientists will apply their skills and knowledge to new areas. 

96
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
In May 2009, for example, U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced 
$2.4 billion in funding to advance research on carbon capture and develop 
carbon storage technologies and infrastructure. These funds are intended to 
go to projects to explore the following: 
	
✓	Clean coal that cuts the sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury typically emitted 
from power plants
	
✓	Carbon capture and storage for industrial plants, including cement 
plants, chemical plants, refineries, manufacturing facilities, power 
plants, and steel plants
	
✓	Beneficial ways to reuse carbon dioxide
	
✓	Identification of geologic sites that can be used to store carbon
	
✓	Training programs to bring the new generation of geoscientists up to 
speed to staff these programs
The goal of these projects is to demonstrate that is it possible to safely, reli­
ably, and affordably contain carbon emissions in an environmentally sound 
way. Although these projects have been spelled out at a theoretical level, no 
one has put these concepts to the test yet. With the absence of actual data, 
it’s hard to know whether large-scale carbon capture and sequestration proj­
ects are economically feasible or physically possible. To get an overview of 
this complex topic, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_
capture_and_storage.
Geoscientists are also likely to turn their skills toward finding water, resolv­
ing hazardous waste issues, and seeking innovative ways to deal with climate 
change issues. Although the industry may not look like it does now, the 
future is full of interesting opportunities for those in this field. Hopefully, the 
change in focus will motivate more students to work in the field.
Sample job functions 
The American Geological Association recently created a working definition of 
the following functions within the geosciences industry: 
	
✓	Geoscientists work in a number of subfields, including environmental 
science, hydrology, oceanography, atmospheric science, geology, geo­
physics, climate science, geochemistry, and paleontology.
	
✓	Geoengineers may work in the environmental area to develop water 
supplies or remediate hazardous areas, or they may work in exploration 
to locate and mine various building materials, metals, coal, and oil.

Hydrology
Water is essential for life. It covers 71 percent of the Earth’s surface in the 
form of water, ice, and steam. Nearly all the Earth’s water is found in large 
bodies of water such as oceans and lakes. A small percentage is found in 
underground caverns called aquifers and held in glaciers and the ice caps. 

98
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
A very slight percentage is seen in the form of clouds and precipitation. 
Ninety-seven percent of the Earth’s water is saltwater and can’t be consumed 
by humans. Of the 3 percent that is fresh water, 70 percent is consumed for 
agricultural uses. As a result, drinking water in many parts of the world is a 
scarce, yet essential, resource. 
In addition to providing all living organisms, including humans, with life, 
water is a dissolving agent, a heat transfer fluid, a way to put out fires, a 
chemical, a location for recreation, a key component of industrial manu­
facturing, and a source of power. Water also plays a key role in linking eco­
systems across the planet; moving food, organisms, and waste from one 
ecosystem to the next. 
Water evaporates into vapors, which then produce precipitation. Runoff from 
rain and snow then runs back to the oceans and lakes. This cycle, called the 
water cycle or the hydrologic cycle, is our main source for naturally occur­
ring fresh water. 
The science of hydrology assesses the quantity and quality of water by study­
ing the movement of water, the quality of water, and how water is distributed 
over time and space throughout the Earth. The study includes the biologi­
cal, chemical, and physical properties of water and how these properties 
interact with the environment and living organisms during the water cycle. 
Subspecialties focus on the following areas: 
	
✓	Hydrography researches the distribution of water.
	
✓	Hydrogeology looks at the movement and distribution of groundwater.
	
✓	Glaciology focuses on glaciers.
	
✓	Limnology tracks inland waters.
	
✓	Surface hydrology studies how water moves on the surface of the earth.
	
✓	Hydrometeorology examines water as it moves from bodies of water to 
the atmosphere.
	
✓	Ecohydrology tackles how organisms interact with water at various 
stages of the water cycle. 
	
✓	Hydroinformatics investigates how to apply information technology to 
hydrology.
Industry’s current status 
In the United States the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is respon­
sible for protecting, regulating, and improving the water resources within the 
country. According to its Web site (www.epa.gov/ow/careers), the EPA 

99
 Chapter 7: Jobs in Caring for the Earth 
protects “over 3 million miles of rivers and streams; over 40 million acres of 
lakes, over 87,000 square miles of estuaries; 95,000 miles of coastal waters; 
and marine waters.”
The EPA’s recent Strategic Plan contains several key goals regarding water. 
Primarily, the Clean and Safe Water Goal strives to keep drinking water safe, 
protect human health, support economic growth, and promote recreational 
activity by restoring water systems and aquatic ecosystems. 
By 2011, the EPA expects to increase the number of people who have access 
to safe drinking water through community water systems. In addition, it has 
plans to rehabilitate and restore rivers, lakes, and streams in watershed 
areas, coastal areas, and wetlands to protect water quality and improve rec­
reational locations. The EPA is also committed to reducing the toxic nature of 
fish and shellfish that have been a risk for public health recently. 
The Healthy Communities and Ecosystems Goal targets the following estu­
aries for restoration and rehabilitation: the Mexico Border area, the Gulf of 
Mexico, the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, the Pacific Island Territories, Long 
Island Sound, the Puget Sound Basin, and the Columbia River Basin.
To achieve these goals, the EPA plans to implement national programs and 
partnerships with states to strengthen water standards and reduce pollu­
tion. Furthermore, the EPA is committed to creating sustainable and efficient 
water practices and strengthening the water infrastructure. Through a vari­
ety of practices such as water quality trading and watershed permitting, the 
goal is to use a watershed approach to restore polluted waterways.

Although the hydrology field is mature, concerns about changes to the natu­
ral water cycle as a result of global warming and climate change are requiring 
new developments in this field. 
Future trends (and caveats) 
In June 2009, President Obama put forth a Presidential Memorandum to 
create an interagency task force to develop a national ocean policy to protect 
the ocean, coastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems. Part of the task force’s mis­
sion is fitting proposals for offshore energy projects into a cohesive marine 
spatial plan. Right now these oceanic ecosystems are protected by 140 laws 
and 20 different agencies that often produce conflicting goals and plans. For 
the latest updates from this task force, see www.whitehouse.gov/oceans.

Global warming is expected to change the hydraulic cycle, adding more vari­
ability to the system. Environmentally sensitive regions may receive too 
much water, in the form of more frequent and intense storms and flooding, 
or too little water by way of drought conditions. Understanding the dynamics 
of these changes is of critical importance for accurate forecasts, proper plan­
ning, and adequate policies by the government and private companies. 
Freshwater needs will increase due to population growth. Creating adequate 
supplies of fresh water is a challenge that scientists and engineers are work­
ing on. Recycling waste water and creating fresh water through desaliniza­
tion systems are two strategies. Without consistent ways to produce potable 
(drinkable) water, conflict may erupt in areas with limited water supplies.

Managing Natural Resources
In This Chapter
▶	Exploring careers that manage the resources we live by
▶	Identifying opportunities in caring for wild creatures
▶	Finding opportunities in land management
▶	Determining how to make a difference in reducing waste
T
he world around us is rich with resources. We are so accustomed to 
having clean air to breathe and clear water to drink that we don’t often 
realize all that goes into managing our natural resources. For example, on 
a typical day do you consider that the forests and lands must be effectively 
managed to supply the wood used to build our houses, the paper used to 
create this book, and the food we eat?
In addition to the natural resources covered in this chapter, I also provide a 
couple of resources that may not seem particularly natural to you. Although 
agriculture is considered to be a man-made resource, I include organic agri­
culture in this chapter because organic farming is as much about the quality 
of the land and water as it is about the food being produced. 
Waste is an abundant resource that has the potential to disrupt the natural 
world in a number of ways. Waste management experts and those in industry 
are finding innovative ways to handle waste in a more eco-friendly manner. 
Although both agriculture and waste management have a ways to go before 
either field is fully green, there are plenty of opportunities for those who 
want to help make the transition happen.

Organic agriculture 
Although agriculture is technically not a natu­
ral resource, organic agriculture is just as 
concerned with the surrounding ecosystem 
as it is with producing food and fiber prod­
ucts. According to the USDA National Organic 
Standards Board (NOSB), “… organic agricul­
ture is an ecological production management 
system that promotes and enhances biodiver­
sity, biological cycles and soil biological activ­
ity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs 
and on management practices that restore, 
maintain and enhance ecological harmony.” 
Demand for organic products continues 
to grow. According to the Organic Trade 
Association (www.ota.com), sales of 
organic food grew from $1 billion in 1990 to 
$23.6 billion in 2008. Approximately 0.8 percent 
of the world’s farmlands are farmed organi­
cally. Organic agriculture is regulated by the 
International Federation of Organic Agriculture 
Movements (IFOAM) (www.ifoam.org) as 
well as national organizations such as USDA’s 
National Organic Program.
Agriculture impacts the environment in a 
number of ways. 
	✓	As an overall industry, agriculture is rather 
a mixed bag when it comes to greenhouse 
gases. On one hand it produces greenhouse 
gases through fertilizers, animal waste, 
and equipment. Then, on the other hand, 
with proper organic farming techniques 
it reduces carbon dioxide by eliminating 
nitrogen rich fertilizers and sequestering 
carbon in the soil. The degree to which 
it does either depends on the farming 
methods used. To find more about how 
organic farming may be a key solution to 
global warming, see The Rodale Institute 
Web site for more information (www.
rodaleinstitute.org).
	✓	Reducing the use of nitrogen fertilizers not 
only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, it 
also reduces toxic runoff that creates dead 
zones in the oceans, such as the Gulf of 
Mexico. 
	✓	Organic agriculture enhances biodiversity 
and population density in a wide range of spe­
cies from soil microbes, beetles, and earth­
worms to birds, butterflies, and mammals. 
Sustainable agriculture strives to integrate 
three goals: environmental stewardship, farm 
profitability, and thriving farming communities. 
To close the sustainability loop, the way food is 
distributed and sold must be factored into the 
equation as well. Some are exploring the idea 
of creating vertical farms in urban centers as 
a way of growing food close to consumers to 
minimize transportation costs. Others question 
whether building vertical farming is a cost-
effective way to solve the problem. Time will 
tell.

Air 
How clean is the air you breathe? The range of factors that influence the 
quality of the air is astounding when you dig into the details. Factories, utili­
ties, power plants, and vehicles that spew out emissions are just a few of the 

103
 Chapter 8: Managing Natural Resources
more obvious culprits. Dry cleaners, wildfires, agriculture, rice cultivation, 
and cud-chewing animals are a few others you may not have thought about 
recently. Oh, and don’t forget buildings that often emit toxins that pollute the 
air you breathe indoors.
Poor air quality impacts us all. Our health, crops, animals, buildings, and 
environment all suffer when the air is difficult or dangerous to breathe. To 
grasp the scope of air quality issues, see www.epa.gov/ebtpages/air.
html and www.4cleanair.org/topicList.asp for lists of issues this 
industry addresses. 
The goal of this industry is to monitor air quality through air measurements 
or to project air qualityby using computer models. Based on the results, 
specialists determine the best ways to control and mitigate the offending 
sources of pollution through technological advances or prevention. If emit­
ters are violating laws, regulators may require that the company add control 
devices, pay penalties, contribute to air pollution research projects, or, if 
worse comes to worse, go to jail. 
Industry’s current status 
The move to address air pollution that began in the 1950s and continues to 
today has made a difference in our air quality. Certainly the most influential 
legislation was the Clean Air Act of 1970 that allowed states and the Federal 
government to limit emissions from industrial locations and vehicles. For 
more information about the historic Clean Air Act, visit www.epa.gov/air/
caa/caa_history.html.
Under the auspices of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), assesses and monitors air quality in two ways: 
	
✓	By measuring the concentration of specific sources of pollution, the 
EPA can determine how pollution levels change over time. Click one of 
the pollutants on this page, www.epa.gov/airtrends, to review the 
concentrations over the last few decades and how they compare to the 
National Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
	
✓	By tracking the overall amount of pollution in the air, the EPA can pro­
vide a real-time assessment of how risky is it to engage in outdoor activi­
ties on any given day. To discover the air quality in your area today, 
take a look at the Air Quality Index map, www.airnow.gov. 
Recent developments that have the potential to reduce pollution from vehi­
cles include the National Fuel Efficiency Policy, which raises the average fuel 
economy standard to 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. For more details read 
the official press release, www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/
President-Obama-Announces-National-Fuel-Efficiency-Policy. 
In addition, in June 2009 the EPA gave California the long-awaited right to 

104
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
implement a 2002 state law requiring that cars have an average fuel economy 
standard of 40 miles per gallon by 2016. By granting California’s request, the 
EPA has opened the door to 13 other states who want to strive for this higher 
standard. To explore this ruling in more depth, see www.epa.gov/otaq/
climate/ca-waiver.htm.
Rating
Although the air quality management industry is mature, it is also facing new 
challenges as issues of global warming raise more and more concerns.
Future trends (and caveats) 
Although the air quality industry has made great strides over the last few 
decades, this is no time to rest on their laurels. In fact, air quality experts 
worldwide must take a very active role in assessing pollutants in the air and 
combating global warming. Given the projected demographics, economics, 
and climate of the future, we must find ways to reduce the release of pollut­
ants into the air. 
Generally speaking, air quality specialists look for voluntary or mandatory 
strategies that control a particular pollutant or a specific pollution source. 
For example, energy efficiency programs, mass transit commute options, 
renewable energy sources, and cap and trade are all viable strategies that 
can be implemented to help minimize greenhouse gas emissions (For more 
on cap and trade, see the nearby “Cap and trade” sidebar.)
According to the National Association of Clean Air Agencies (NACAA), emis­
sions from manufacturing sources and vehicles have been reduced through 
technological advances. The air pollution control technologies industry is 
going to play a critical role in the coming years. For a detailed list of the ways 
in which technology can control various sources of pollution, visit www.icac.
com and click the Technology tab. From emissions monitoring systems to con­
trols for greenhouse gases, particulates, and mercury, the companies within 
the Institute of Clean Air Companies are on the cutting edge of this field. 
One power tussle that has the potential to be a game changer is the role the 
EPA has when it comes to monitoring, regulating, and enforcing greenhouse 
gases. As I write this section, several threads of this story are unfolding, 
with no clear outcome in sight. To give you a chance of unraveling what may 
happen after this book has gone to press, let me give you a bit of history.
	
✓	First, during a case between the state of Massachusetts and the EPA in 
2007, the Supreme Court found, for the first time, that greenhouse gases 
fell under the auspices of the Clean Air Act. 

105
 Chapter 8: Managing Natural Resources
	
✓	Then in April 2009, the EPA filed paperwork with its findings that the 
combination of the six greenhouse gases is in fact harmful to humans 
and that the emissions from new vehicles have an effect on global warm­
ing. (You can read about this procedure on the EPA site at http://
epa.gov/climatechange/endangerment.html.) Although these 
findings do not trigger any new regulations, those who emit greenhouse 
gases are more than a little nervous by this new state of affairs. 
	
✓	And finally, in June 2009, the American Clean Energy and Security (ACES) 
bill passed the House of Representatives with an11th-hour compromise 
that limits the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon dioxide, one of the key 
greenhouse gases. If this version were to become law, power plants would 
not have any reason to update old carbon emitting equipment. Here is the 
best article I’ve found to explain this rather complex situation: http://
solveclimate.com/blog/20090722/senate-urged-protect-
clean-air-act-climate-bill.
As I write, a grass-roots campaign has started to keep the Clean Air Act from 
being gutted by this critical bill on climate change. As the drama unfolds, I’ll 
post developments on Green Career Central’s updates page, www.green
careercentral.com/updates.

Cap and trade
Cap and trade is a market-based environmen­
tal policy used to discourage emissions and 
encourage early innovation, energy efficiency, 
and action. Cap and trade systems have been 
used successfully to manage target pollutants, 
such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide, pro­
duced by pollution from power plants since 
1995. Now cap and trade is being discussed 
as a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
such as carbon dioxide and methane.
Although the United States doesn’t have a 
national cap and trade program, it’s important 
to understand the concept. Any national cap 
and trade system that is put in place is likely to 
be similar to those already in place. The system 
must include the following components:
	✓	Initially, a cap is set to define the upper limit 
for greenhouse gases a company or plant 
can emit. 
	✓	Greenhouse gas emitters are given 
allowances to emit a specific amount of 
emissions. It’s likely that the amount of 
emissions that can be emitted each year 
will decrease over time. The wording of the 
final policy will determine which companies 
and utilities will do business under the cap 
and trade system. 
	✓	Each emitter is able to determine how it will 
comply with the required cap. The emit­
ter can purchase additional allowances 
from other companies that don’t need the 
allowances for their own emissions. This 
process is referred to as trading allow­
ances. Emitters can also reduce their emis­
sions by implementing efficiency measures, 
installing controls, or finding less carbon-
intensive sources of energy. 
	✓	At the end of the designated period, the 
company must turn in allowances equal to 
the amount of emissions it produced.
For this system to work, each company must 
accurately measure and report their emissions 
in a timely manner. New positions, such as 
carbon accountants, are likely to develop to do 
this work. 
Several regional cap and trade systems are 
forming throughout the U.S. The Regional 
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (www.rggi.org), 
a cooperative of ten states in the Northeast 
and Mid-Atlantic area, is the first manda­
tory program in the United States. Two other 
programs, the Western Climate Initiative and 
the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction 
Accord, are in the planning stages.

Fish and Wildlife
If you’ve ever hit a traffic jam in a national park, you know instinctively to look 
around for large mammals. Whether it’s a bear jam or a mountain goat jam, the 
reason is the same: Humans love to see wildlife up close and personal. Although the 
enthusiastic response and awe are commendable, most vacationers don’t know how 
to interact with wildlife without endangering themselves and the wildlife. 
People who work in this field spend quite a bit of time creating and maintain­
ing the delicate balance that exists between keeping animals wild and people 
safe. In addition, they use a variety of scientific disciplines to study, manage, 
and conserve wildlife populations they are there to protect. The strategies 
they use to achieve positive results for wildlife include protecting endan­
gered species, enhancing biodiversity, tracking migratory birds, and restor­
ing fisheries and other habitats. In addition to educating the public about 
wildlife conservation and safety, wildlife managers also enforce laws and con­
tribute their expertise to shape Federal and local wildlife policies.
Industry’s current status 
In the last few decades the focus of wildlife management has shifted from con­
centrating on a key species to conserving, restoring, and maintaining complete 
ecosystems and enhancing biodiversity. The impetus for this relatively new 
focus is the concern about the loss of species that is likely to occur over the 
next few decades. The broader, more interdependent perspective on wildlife 
populations makes it easier to restore diversity within ecosystems. 
Together the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service attend 
to the needs of the fish and wildlife in parks and refuges throughout the coun­
try. To explore the extent of their reach, check out this list of national wildlife 
programs (www.fws.gov/info/function.html) and this map of refuges in 
each state (www.fws.gov/refuges). Each state also has several departments 
that address local conservation issues and manage wildlife issues. 
As a result of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act of 2009, the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service will receive $280 million over the next few years for 
construction projects at service facilities, renewable energy projects, habi­
tat restoration, deferred maintenance projects, and road construction on 
national wildlife refuges. 
Rating
The wildlife management industry is mature. Global warming and climate 
changes are impacting ecosystems and requiring additional efforts to protect 
and conserve ecosystems and wildlife.

Future trends (and caveats) 
A coalition of more than 6,000 organizations, businesses, and agencies have 
worked together for several years on the Teaming with Wildlife campaign 
(www.teaming.com) to bring a long-term, stable funding source to state fish 
and wildlife conservation programs. In May 2009 they announced $61 million 
in State Wildlife Grants to go toward conservation and restoration of habi­
tats for species in danger of going extinct. These funds are to be distributed 
through grants into 2010.
The push to develop renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, 
geothermal, and biomass, is bringing new challenges to wildlife manag­
ers throughout the world. Finding the best locations for utility-sized solar 
arrays, wind farms, and geothermal installations is a challenge on a good day. 
Unfortunately, no one really knows how these renewable energy systems will 
impact wildlife and habitats directly, indirectly, or cumulatively. To make 
the best possible siting decisions, wildlife managers must have a place at the 
negotiation table.
To get a sense of the scope of this challenge, consider this: The Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) has “identified about 21 million acres with wind 
potential in the 11 western states, 29 million acres with solar energy poten­
tial in the six southwestern states and 140 million acres with geothermal 
resource potential in the West and Alaska.” As the renewable portfolio stan­
dard is put in place nationally, more and more states will be striving to gener­
ate more of their electricity through renewable energy sources. 
Several groups are coming together to address this challenge collaboratively. 
For instance The Wind Energy Subcommittee of the Association of Fish and 
Wildlife Agencies (www.fishwildlife.org/about_comm_windpower.
html) and the American Wind Wildlife Institute (www.awwi.org), a nonprofit 
organization that includes representatives from conservation organizations, 
government agencies, and industry, have been created to explore issues 
related to wind projects. The Audubon Society and the National Resources 
Defense Council have worked in concert to develop a Google map to highlight 
areas that are too sensitive for renewable energy developments (www.nrdc.
org/media/2009/090401a.asp).

Forests
When you think of a forest, you most likely think of thousands of acres of 
trees in an area that includes streams, meadows, and wildlife. What many 
don’t realize is that forests are one of the most critical ecosystems on the 
planet. Managing forests — whether they are old growth, second growth, 
industrial, park lands, or urban — is a crucial part of bringing the planet back 
into balance. 
Forestry is a broad term used to refer to the management of natural forests, 
industrial forests, and the other natural resources found within forests. Many 
refer to this profession as a science, an art, and a practice. To succeed you 
must rely on your knowledge of biology, quantitative abilities, and technical 
skill. In addition, you must have managerial skills and know how to encourage 
people to act in ways that conserve forests. The goals of a forester are many: 
	
✓	Growing and managing the forest
	
✓	Extracting the timber in a sustainable way and processing it as a raw 
material for use in a huge array of products

110
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
	
✓	Reforesting, restoring, and remediating forests that have been degraded, 
damaged, or destroyed
	
✓	Managing and protecting wildlife habitat, watershed area, and water 
resources found in the forested areas
	
✓	Providing recreation opportunities
	
✓	Maintaining air quality and water quality while naturally sequestering 
carbon from the atmosphere
Forests provide us with a number of products that are critical to our econ­
omy and our lifestyle. Everything from raw lumber for construction and fur­
niture to fibers and pulp for paper and packaging. A number of fuel sources 
such as firewood, pellets, biomass, and charcoal are derived from forests. 
Industry’s current status 
The U.S. Forest Service is actively working to understand the state of the 
nation’s forests (www.fia.fs.fed.us) and the impact of possible climate 
change scenarios (www.fs.fed.us/research/climate). In addition, the 
U.S. Forest Service has received $936 million from the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) to invest in the 93 million acres of public lands 
it manages; to go toward fire management, building and maintaining facilities, 
establishing and repairing trails and roads, restoring watershed areas, and 
dealing with abandoned mines. The projects have created jobs in 32 states 
(see www.fs.fed.us/news/2009/releases/07/projects.shtml).
According to the American Forest & Paper Association, the U.S. forest prod­
ucts industry that produces wood, paper, packaging, and related products 
“accounts for approximately 6 percent of the total U.S. manufacturing GDP, 
placing it on par with the automotive and plastics industries.”
Threats of global deforestation sparked the 1993 establishment of the Forest 
Stewardship Council (www.fsc.org), an international forest certification 
system to encourage sustainable forest management practice. Working 
with various certification bodies such as the Rainforest Alliance (www.
rainforest-alliance.org), the FSC provides certifications for organiza­
tions that grow and harvest forests, companies that use or sell forest prod­
ucts even though they don’t grow trees, forest management companies that 
want to ensure that their wood is legally and ethically harvested, and compa­
nies that manage and harvest products such as seeds or nuts from forests. 
Although several other certification programs exist, such as the Sustainable 
Forestry Initiative in North America (www.sfiprogram.org), the American 
Tree Farm System (www.treefarmsystem.org) for privately owned 

111
 Chapter 8: Managing Natural Resources
forests, and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification 
Council (www.pefc.org), the FSC program is generally seen as the industry 
standard. To compare systems, see www.certifiedwoodsearch.org/
matrix/matrix.aspx.
In addition to forest management changes, the forest products industry 
(www.afandpa.org) has made a concerted effort to recycle paper and 
pulp to recover paper fibers that can be used to generate recycled paper. 
According to the American Forest and Paper Association, 57.4 percent of 
the paper consumed in the U.S. was recovered for recycling in 2008 (www.
afandpa.org/Recycling.aspx). By 2012, the paper industry would like to 
hit a goal of 60 percent paper recovery. Every ton of paper that is recovered 
by the industry saves considerable landfill space, energy, water, and trees. 
Rating
The forestry industry is mature with a growing interest in sustainable practices.
Future trends (and caveats)
As the climate changes, the U.S. Forest Service’s role as caretaker of the forests 
is likely to become more important and more difficult. As ecosystems shift in 
response to rising temperatures, pests and invasive species potentially take 
hold in new regions, wildfires may rage out of control, and prolonged droughts 
may take their toll on forested areas. For a detailed statement of the U.S. Forest 
Service goals and objectives from now until 2012, take a look at this report: 
www.fs.fed.us/publications/strategic/fs-sp-fy07-12.pdf.
The American Forest and Paper Association has created a road map to help 
all stakeholders look to the future of the industry. Read the report (www.
agenda2020.org/PDF/FPI_Roadmap%20Final_Aug2006.pdf) to discover 
new technology options, new products, and sustainable business models. 
The forest products industry has voluntarily committed to reducing its 
greenhouse gas emissions by 2012 through the Climate VISION program 
(www.climatevision.gov/sectors), a voluntary public-private partner­
ship initiative to improve energy efficiency and greenhouse gas intensity in 
energy-intensive industrial sectors. The industry is utilizing biomass from 
their production process to produce steam that is then used to generate elec­
tricity and dry paper products. The added efficiency reduces carbon emis­
sions and energy costs for forest product plants. 
Forest2Fuel (www.forest2market.com), a company that provides pricing 
information to the timber industry, is tracking trends in the biomass/biofuel 
arena. Although forestry clearing projects, forest products manufacturing 

112
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
plants, and construction projects produce a variety of woody feedstocks 
that can be used as fuel, it’s currently unclear whether bioenergy will be a 
viable new income stream for this industry. The viability depends on how 
biomass is defined by pending legislation and whether wood-related sources 
of biomass are designated as a viable source of renewable energy for the 
Renewable Energy Standard.

Land
Land management consists of managing a wide variety of lands including 
forests, croplands, rangelands, national parks, public lands, and urban areas. 
In addition to providing stunning views and beautiful vacation destinations, 
land provides us with a variety of resources including wood products, water, 
and energy (see Chapter 9). In addition, the land and vegetation perform criti­
cal services for us by cleaning the air we breathe, filtering the water we drink, 
and capturing the carbon we emit into the atmosphere. 
Depending on your interests, you may be drawn to one or more of the follow­
ing activities within land management: 
	
✓	Land Use or Zoning: Generally handled through local government, each 
piece of land, whether developed or undeveloped, is governed by land use 
regulations or zoning. (See Chapter 11 for more information on planning.)
	
✓	Conservation: The goal of conservation is to protect habitats from irrep­
arable damage. In some cases a particular species is at the core of the 
conservation effort.
	
✓	Restoration: Bringing damaged lands and waters back to a renewed 
state in such a way that they function as they did originally. 
	
✓	Remediation: This term is typically used to refer to restoring an area 
that has been polluted or contaminated by prior uses. The land may 
need to be remediated for human health reasons or because the land is 
slated to be redeveloped for a new purpose. 
Industry’s current status 
According to the U.S. Forest Service, nearly all the 770 million acres of range­
lands in the United States are west of the Mississippi River, with the wet 
grasslands of Florida as the exception. Rangelands are unimproved lands with 
a high proportion of native vegetation that may be marshy, shrubby, grassy, 
or arid desert. According to the Society of Range Management, rangelands 
comprise almost half of all the lands in the world. Caring for these lands is 
critical to the well-being of the planet.

The Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 converted million of acres 
of Federal lands and miles of rivers into wilderness. With the signing of this law, 
the 26 million acres of public lands within the National Landscape Conservation 
System are permanently protected under the Bureau of Land Management. For 
details read the press release: www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/
Statement-from-the-Presidents-signing-statements-on-HR-146-

A growing portion of private lands are managed by land trust organizations. 
In 2005 when the Land Trust Alliance conducted its National Land Trust 
Census (www.landtrustalliance.org/about-us/land-trust-
census), it found land trusts had doubled to 37 million acres since 
their last census.

Overall land management is a mature industry. Sustainability practices that 
have developed over the last few decades are experiencing a surge of interest. 
Future trends (and caveats) 
An increasing number of land owners and managers are managing their land 
holistically or sustainably, using a triple bottom line approach that balances 
financial results, environmental impact, and community impact. Through 
monitoring and sustainable land management practices, land owners 
and managers make changes to restore the land. According to Holistic 
Management International, 30 million acres of land worldwide use its system 
of holistic land management. Results include improved biodiversity on man­
aged lands, increased profits, better water conservation, restoring land, and 
increasing the land’s capacity to support wildlife and domestic herds. By 
improving the land’s function, carbon is naturally sequestered in grasslands 
and soil. For more information about this method of land management, see 
www.holisticmanagement.org. Take a look at the images on the home 
page to see the dramatic difference between holistically managed land and 
traditionally managed land. 
As the interest in domestic renewable energy sources grows, land use issues 
are likely to take center stage as utilities and other energy developers scope 
out where to site solar farms, wind farms, geothermal plants, and smart grid 
transmission lines.

Waste
Unfortunately, one of the most abundant resources we have on the planet is 
waste. According to the EPA, in 2007 each person in the United States pro­
duced 4.6 pounds of waste per day. When you add it up, that waste takes a 
lot of energy and land to collect and manage. The sheer volume of waste we 
produce is becoming a problem. 
Thankfully, recycling education efforts are beginning to pay off. Of that 4.6 
pounds of waste each person produces each day, 33 percent is now reused 

116
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
or recycled according to the EPA. Only 54 percent of residential municipal 
solid waste went to landfill as of 2007, as opposed to 89 percent in 1980. For 
more details, see www.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/pubs/
msw07-fs.pdf.
Managing waste streams requires a coordinated effort by a number of waste 
management teams. After your garbage and recycling are collected from your 
curb, they are taken to a processing center where the waste is sorted and 
transferred to the right location. Some of it may end up in landfill while some 
may be sorted, cleaned, and sold as scrap for reuse. 
Although you may not think much about what happens to your trash after it 
is picked up from your street, someone continues to manage your trash in 
the landfill for years to come. Even after a landfill is closed, the property and 
the gases emitted from the trash must be managed indefinitely. Some waste 
management companies are converting the emitted methane gas into renew­
able energy. Others use a technology called waste-to-energy to incinerate the 
trash in carefully designed plants (see Chapter 9 for more).
Industry’s current status 
The EPA’s most visible waste program is the Resource Conservation 
Challenge (RCC), which aims to encourage all Americans to pay attention to 
how they are handling waste. The key priorities include 
	
✓	Recycling 35 percent of the municipal solid waste from businesses, 
industries, and residences. In the first phase, the targets are paper, 
garden waste, and packaging. Special programs are being put in place to 
help large waste producers recycle with ease. 
	
✓	Recycling all electronics through special disposal programs with retail­
ers and manufacturers. Electronic items contain toxins that have serious 
health consequences. By harvesting these chemicals and components, 
we can reuse them rather than extracting more from the Earth. 
	
✓	Recycling industrial and construction waste can make a considerable 
impact due to the volume and nature of the waste produced by indus­
trial plants and construction projects. 
	
✓	Reducing the use of chemicals that are toxic and have been deemed par­
ticularly harmful to human health and the environment.
Although programs are a critical piece of the puzzle, without effective market­
ing and education, waste reduction programs do not produce results. The key 
to success is reaching out to people to show them how to take new actions and 
establish new habits around waste. One of the tools the EPA is using in its mar­
keting campaign is a report with success stories for each of their main goals: 
www.epa.gov/epawaste/rcc/resources/rcc-rpt4.pdf.

Though the overall waste management industry is mature, necessity is the 
catalyst for new innovations and goals.
Future trends (and caveats) 
In addition to ramping up various programs to encourage individuals and 
businesses to reduce, reuse, and recycle, the waste management industry is 
making other moves. A number of collection companies are replacing their 
truck fleets with vehicles that run on alternative fuels to reduce greenhouse 
gases emitted during the transfer of waste from one location to the next. 
Municipalities are also implementing innovative solutions to reduce the 
waste that goes to landfill. In the summer of 2009, San Francisco passed a 
Universal Recycling and Composting Ordinance that requires everyone in 
the city to sort their waste into three categories: recyclables, compostables, 
and waste. Fines await those who don’t participate. To handle the organic 
compostable material, the city’s waste management service has created a 
processing center just for food scraps, green waste, and those pizza boxes 
you never know whether to recycle or not. According to SFRecycling (www.
sfrecycling.com), 75 percent of the city’s restaurants are participating in 
the commercial version of the composting program.
One innovative company, BigBelly Solar (www.bigbellysolar.com), is 
changing the way cities manage trash in public areas. Their trash cans are 
really trash collectors that use solar energy to compact the trash when it 
reaches the top of the can. When the can is full, BigBelly notifies the waste 
collectors to tell them it’s full. When Philadelphia recently replaced 700 
public trash cans with 500 of these newfangled garbage cans, they ended up 
reducing their collection runs for public areas by 75 percent. Imagine what 
that can do for a city’s trash collection budget. 
Industry is also getting into the waste reduction game by rethinking manufac­
turing processes to eliminate sources of waste, find ways to reuse waste in 
their own processes, or sell it to other companies that can use it. Interface, a 
worldwide carpet manufacturer, has spent the last 15 years finding ways to 
become more sustainable. According to its Web site, www.interfaceglobal.
com/Sustainability/Progress-to-Zero.aspx, the company kept 100 
million pounds of waste out of landfills and saved $372 million dollars that 
would have been spent on waste removal in the 12 years between 1995 and 

118
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
2007. What’s the secret? Interface actually solicits worn-out carpet to disas­
semble it and reuse the backing and fibers in new carpet. In addition, it recy­
cles trimmings right back into the production cycle.
It’s not just global companies that are finding innovative ways to transform 
trash into value. Shane McQuade, founder of Voltaic Systems, Inc., found a 
way to turn soda bottles into backpacks and messenger bags that have a 
solar panel to recharge cellphones. His latest feat is a briefcase with enough 
solar power to recharge a laptop. Stay tuned — this guy seems to be on to 
something: www.voltaicsystems.com. 
For some, the ultimate approach to waste is something called zero waste. See 
the nearby sidebar, “Zero waste,” for more information about this innovation.

Water 
Water is one of the most essential natural resources on the planet. In some 
areas clean, high-quality drinking water is abundant and accessible. In other 
areas that suffer from drought conditions or inadequate water infrastruc­
ture, what little water there is may not be fit to drink. Although fresh water 
supplies are naturally regenerated through rainfall, the demand on fresh 
water supplies is often higher than the supply. It’s likely that this burden will 
become even more extreme if climate changes continue to accelerate. 
In addition, water usage has a direct impact on greenhouse gas emissions. 
According to the EPA, “an estimated 3 percent of national energy consump­
tion, equivalent to approximately 56 billion kilowatt hours (kWh), is used for 
drinking water and waste water services. Assuming the average mix of energy 
sources in the country, this equates to adding approximately 45 million tons 
of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere.”
Zero waste
Imagine a world without waste! Zero waste 
proponents believe we need to rethink our 
entire relationship with waste. They would like 
us to take inspiration from nature, where every 
output is an input to another process. With 
this perspective, every kind of waste become 
a potential resource to be used for another 
purpose. 
With some proper prior planning, we can avoid 
using hazardous materials in products and pro­
duction processes so we don’t have to worry 
about the waste when the product is thrown 
into landfills. In addition, we can think ahead 
to determine waste streams from the produc­
tion process and the end-of-life process for 
the product. With ingenuity, it’s possible to 
convert these waste streams into an input for 
another product or the next generation of the 
same product.
To achieve this goal of zero waste, companies 
must use innovation to rethink every stage of 
the product life cycle to eliminate all inefficien­
cies. Those who work with waste must reframe 
their tasks to focus on reusing materials as 
much as possible. In the end, a zero waste phi­
losophy reduces costs for extracting resources 
and disposing of waste, increases efficiencies, 
and increases profits.

Water resource management consists of the following components:
	
✓	Treating water for end use: Whether water is to used for drinking, 
industrial uses, or medical uses, or is waste water that is ready to be 
returned to the natural water cycle, it must be clear of contaminants and 
cleaned. Local water treatment facilities process water through a series 
of steps to provide high-quality water required by users. 
	
✓	Distributing water through irrigation: In arid areas, water management 
includes moving water resources to the areas that need them for grow­
ing crops or other agricultural applications. 
	
✓	Managing flood waters: In coastal areas or on land near rivers and 
lakes, local authorities must manage the overabundance of water to 
keep residents, business owners, and land safe. 
	
✓	Water conservation: As water becomes more difficult to come by, find­
ing ways to conserve it is the focus of water utilities throughout the 
country.
Industry’s current status 
Much of the U.S. water system was built in response to the population boom 
after World War II. As a result, the water mains, pipes, pumps, and water treat­
ment plants are now showing their age. Although our water infrastructure isn’t 
in dire straits at the moment, that situation is just a matter of time unless we 
create a strategic plan to update the system and finance the work. The EPA 
advocates the Sustainable Infrastructure Initiative to help local water utilities 
plan for repairs and enhancements over time. For more about this initiative, 
see www.epa.gov/waterinfrastructure/basicinformation.html.
To ensure that local and regional water utilities have the tools, knowledge, 
and support they need to implement changes to their infrastructure, the EPA 
joined with six water associations to create “Ten Attributes of Effectively 
Managed Water Sector Utilities.” You can read all about this program at www.
watereum.org. By laying out best practices for the nation’s water utilities, 
local organizations can focus their efforts on working with industry on con­
servation measures, building their capacity to provide adequate supplies 
of drinking water, and finding energy efficient ways to process water (www.
epa.gov/waterinfrastructure/bettermanagement.html).
Rating
Water resource management is a mature field, though expected changes in 
the climate are likely to spur a new level of innovation as water shortages are 
expected locally and worldwide. 

121
 Chapter 8: Managing Natural Resources
Future trends (and caveats) 
The Clean Water Act of 1972 gave the EPA regulatory methods to clean 
local waterways. The Water Quality Act in 1987 bolstered that toolkit. Then 
Supreme Court decisions weakened the water protection system signifi­
cantly. The proposed Clean Water Restoration Act of 2009 http://
feingold.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=311001,making its way through 
Congress at this writing, means to restore the strength of the original laws. 
Existing and anticipated water shortages, both locally and globally, are 
inspiring water resource managers to look at innovative ways to meet the 
demand for water for various uses:
	
✓	The EPA is encouraging local governments to explore the natural water­
sheds in their regions to discover ways to repair or restore the natural 
flow of water. Although natural watershed areas may cross state or local 
district boundaries, it’s essential to develop partnerships to work together 
to enhance this water delivery option. For more information visit www.epa.
gov/waterinfrastructure/watershedapproaches.html.
	
✓	Water reclamation (also known as water recycling and water reuse) systems 
are being built to treat waste water such that it can then be used for irriga­
tion, industrial uses, landscaping, flushing toilets, and a variety of other 
uses. Some municipalities are actually creating potable or drinkable water 
from their waste water. Although not palatable to many of us who are unac­
customed to this notion, water has been reclaimed in this manner by Israel, 
Jordan, and Australia for some time. Arizona, Texas, Virginia, and Florida 
commonly add treated water to their underground water reserves that are 
used for drinking water (www.sandiego.gov/water/recycled/faq.
shtml). To find out more about this option, visit www.watereuse.org.
	
✓	Desalination or desalinization aims to produce fresh water from salt 
water. It’s expensive and energy intensive, so researchers are on the hunt 
for technology that will enable salt to be removed from salt water. Plants 
currently exist in Tampa Bay, Florida, and the United Arab Emirates.
Water conservation by residents, and more important, industrial users, is a 
key component of any water management plan. When industrial manufacturers 
rethink their processes, install sensors, and eliminate waste streams, massive 
amounts of water are conserved for other use. As companies face this issue, 
they are likely to rely on water management experts to determine the best way 
to minimize water use in their plants. Is that where you come in?

▶	Harnessing the planet’s water
▶	Working with the sun and the wind for energy
O
ne of the foundations of the green economy is renewable energy — 
energy that is derived from resources that are readily available all over 
the world. In many cases the resources are natural, but in a few instances 
man-made waste is also being converted to power. The crucial feature of 
renewable energy is that by tapping into its power, you don’t deplete the 
resource, nor do you inflict damage on the environment or the planet as a 
whole.
The transition from fossil fuel–based energy to renewable energy is moti­
vated by the threat of global warming, climate change, and the long-term 
threat of dwindling oil supplies. Many in the United States are also advocat­
ing for energy independence to increase national security, take responsibility 
for fuel production domestically, and stabilize fuel production costs. 
At this point no one can predict which renewable energy technologies will 
become standard and which will fade away or be relegated to specialty appli­
cations. The mix of renewable energy sources will vary geographically based 
on local resources, existing infrastructure, funding sources, regulations, incen­
tives, and what needs to be powered (cars, homes, factories, and so on). 
I identify eight main renewable energy sources:
	
✓	Onshore wind
	
✓	Offshore wind
	
✓	Solar photovoltaics

124
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
	
✓	Solar thermal electricity generation
	
✓	Municipal solid waste-to-energy
	
✓	Sugar-based ethanol
	
✓	Cellulosic and next generation biofuels
	
✓	Geothermal power
Shaping the Lower-Carbon Economy
Policies and treaties are likely to set the standards that motivate investors, 
industries, businesses, and citizens to make the transition from fossil fuels to 
lower-carbon alternatives. The following policies are in the works: 
	
✓	The Renewable Energy Standard, also referred to as the Renewable 
Portfolio Standard, requires that a certain percentage of electricity come 
from renewable sources by a specific date. At the time of this writing, 37 
states have standards or goals in place. You can see them for yourself at 
www.pewclimate.org/what_s_being_done/in_the_states/rps.
cfm. Click on each state to read its Renewable Energy Standard.
	
✓	A National Renewable Energy Standard would create a built-in market 
for renewable energy companies nationwide. When, and if, this standard 
becomes law, the actual details of the plan will define the future for the 
renewable energy industries. Watch for the percentage of electricity to 
come from renewable energy sources and for which renewable sources 
are deemed acceptable. Any source of renewable energy that is not 
included in this standard will become less attractive to investors and 
utilities. You can bet that all the renewable energy industries described 
in this chapter are lobbying hard to be included. To read the case 
for a National Renewable Energy Standard, see www.renewable
energyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/09/getting-to-a-
national-renewable-energy-standard.
	
✓	A cap and trade system is also likely to be implemented at some point 
in the United States to discourage companies from producing green­
house gas emissions. In this system, entities that generate greenhouse 
gases above a set cap must purchase emissions credits from entities 
that produce less pollution. As this system is set up, the defined cap and 
the designated industries will shape the form of the green economy. For 
more details about this system, see Chapter 8.
	
Policies and financing put into place by the American Renewal and 
Reinvestment Act (February 2009) have given new life to emerging and grow­
ing renewables. Although the details vary by industry; grants, investment tax 
credits, production tax credits, and residential tax credits provided by the act 
encourage and enable investors, companies, local governments, businesses, 
and individuals to take more sustainable actions.

 Chapter 9: Angling for Jobs in Alternative Energy
Converting Waste into Energy
Sad to say, one of the most abundant resources on the planet at this time in his­
tory is waste. Traditionally, waste has been buried in landfills. Landfills, because 
of microorganisms that see them as food sources, emit methane gas, a green­
house gas that is 21 times more dangerous to the planet than carbon dioxide. For 
a detailed explanation, see www.epa.gov/methane/scientific.html. What 
if we could take all this waste and use it to generate energy?
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Power Act, and the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) consider waste-to-energy to be a renewable 
source of energy because the power is created from a sustainable, abundant 
resource that is available locally. Thanks to innovations in waste manage­
ment, two overlapping technologies have arisen that relieve pressure on 
close-to-capacity landfills while producing energy at the same time:
	
✓	Biomass power (or biopower): Biopower creates electric power from 
organic material such as manure, crops, wood resources and process­
ing residue, food and yard waste, and municipal bio waste. Biomass can 
be converted to electricity, biofuels, space heating/cooling, or process 
heat. (See www.nrbp.org/bioenergy/products for more on biomass 
power.) 
	
	When you consider the entire life cycle of biomass power, you can see 
that using biomass power reduces greenhouse gases. Organic materi­
als consume carbon as they grow. When the same organic material is 
processed as biomass, it releases carbon back into the atmosphere, 
but the amount of carbon emitted is less than it took in while growing. 
Furthermore, by converting these biomass materials into power, the 
waste is diverted from disposal methods such as landfills, open burns, 
forest accumulation and fires, and composting, which all produce large 
quantities of greenhouse gases. For a full description of this process, see 
the diagram at www.usabiomass.org/docs/Biopower_is_Carbon_
Neutral_Fact_Sheet2.pdf. Research indicates that for every mega­
watt of biomass power produced, 1.6 tons of carbon dioxide is avoided 
(www.usabiomass.org/docs/pri_one_pager.pdf).
	
✓	Waste-to-energy (WTE): WTE facilities burn organic and manufactured 
waste in carefully designed boilers with modern pollution control equip­
ment to scrub the emissions from the burn and maintain precise heat 
conditions to ensure that all waste matter is combusted completely. For 
each ton of municipal solid waste combusted, 500–600 kilowatt-hours 
(kWh) of electricity are produced. The electricity can be added to the 
grid, while the steam produced can heat buildings. Since the mid-1970s, 
the process has been perfected to handle acid gas, particulate matter, 
nitrogen oxides, mercury, and organic emissions safely. For more, see 
www.broward.org/solidwaste/wastetoenergy.htm.

126
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
	
	Although the combustion process does emit carbon dioxide, the process 
removes far more greenhouse gas emissions than it creates. In fact, 
when one ton of trash is processed at a waste-to-energy plant, one less 
ton of carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere. For a detailed 
explanation of this, see the detailed answer for the second question on 
www.wte.org/faq.
Industry’s current status 
The United States currently has more than 100 biomass power plants in 
20 states (www.biomasspowerassociation.org/pages/facts.php). 
According to the Department of Energy (DOE), with the exception of hydro­
power, biomass power produces more electricity than any other renewable 
energy resource in the United States. The biomass power industry is likely to 
be concentrated in rural areas of the West Coast, the Mississippi Valley from 
the upper Midwest to the mouth of the Mississippi River, the Southeast, and 
Maine. For maps illustrating the reach of this industry, see www.nrel.gov/
gis/biomass.html. As of fall of 2009, the biomass industry is rallying their 
forces to convince Congress to extend existing tax credits due to expire at the 
end of 2009. If you’re interested in entering this field, track updates on this 
topic here: www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=3095.
Eighty-seven of the waste-to-energy plants built since the 1970s are still in oper­
ation in 27 states (http://swana.org/Education/TechnicalDivisions/
WastetoEnergy/tabid/108/Default.aspx). These plants process only 8 
percent of the waste produced in the U.S. each year, meaning that the industry 
has ample room to expand. For a list of organizations and local governments 
that operate waste-to-energy plants, see www.wte.org/about. More than 500 
waste-to-energy plants have been built worldwide. 
Rating
The biomass and waste-to-energy industries have the potential to grow. The 
technology has been perfected over the last three decades and is proven to 
work. The technology could be expanded throughout the United States and 
the world to produce energy and contend with waste generated locally. 
Future trends (and caveats) 
Sources for biomass power abound. The DOE estimates that 14 percent of 
our electricity could come from crops grown for energy production and from 
waste generated from agricultural crops. Currently 39 million tons of crop 
residues are wasted annually in the U.S. alone. Food waste from groceries, 
restaurants, and homes also produce tons of biomass.

127
 Chapter 9: Angling for Jobs in Alternative Energy
Some coal plants are now adding up to 20 percent biomass in a process 
called co-firing. In addition to lowering the cost of operations, adding biomass 
reduces greenhouse emissions. A 2009 study in Science demonstrated that 
fueling cars with electricity from biomass was 80 percent more efficient than 
using the same biomass to produce biofuels. That means investment dollars 
may be diverted to biomass electricity production from liquid biofuels. 
One of the most important next steps for this industry is to create demon­
stration plants to familiarize the public and politicians with the process and 
the benefits of biomass power. Building confidence in the technology is likely 
to lead to more interest in commercial applications. Another key determinant 
is how it is classified in the climate change policy discussions. If biomass is 
categorized as a carbon emitter, then all the carbon tax or trading rules will 
apply to the industry. The industry might contract as a result of additional 
taxes or fees. If it’s designated as a source of renewable energy, then incen­
tives to use this methodology will be put in place. 
The waste-to-energy industry must overcome some history. Back in 1994 the 
Supreme Court ruled that urban areas must transport their waste long dis­
tances to newly created landfills. As a result, development of new WTE plants 
stopped. A more recent ruling by the courts has restored communities’ 
ability to determine where their waste goes for processing. Concerns stem 
from the fact that early WTE plants didn’t adequately address environmental 
issues. These issues have now been addressed, and some of the biggest com­
panies are winning awards for their environmental work. The other concern 
environmentalists have is that people will stop recycling if they know their 
trash will be taken care of by the local WTE plan. Studies indicate, however, 
that the average recycling rate is higher than average in WTE communities. 
	
Both biopower and WTE plants are most cost-effective when located near the 
source of biomass. Agricultural and forestry-related businesses in rural areas 
of the country could add new income streams and put local residents to work 
as a result of thriving waste-to-energy and biopower plants.
Sample job functions 
	
✓	Research and development efforts at universities, national laboratories,

✓	As the industry develops, farmers and foresters will be needed to pro­
duce and harvest biomass, and waste-management employees will be 
needed to collect and move waste materials.

The basics of biofuel
Organic matter can also be processed into 
liquid fuels such as ethanol, biodiesel, and 
hydrogen that are capable of powering vehi­
cles. Researchers are testing three genera­
tions of biofuels to find the most cost-effective, 
environmentally sustainable technologies to 
produce liquid fuels. 
	✓	First generation: Biofuels in this category 
are made from basic feedstocks of food 
quality, such as seeds and grains. The 
sugars, starches, vegetables, or animal 
fats in them are used to make vegetable oil, 
biodiesel, bioalcohols (commonly ethanol), 
and other gases.
	✓	Second generation: Non-food crops, includ­
ing waste biomass, agricultural waste, and 
biomass crops (switchgrass and miscan­
thus) grown for this purpose, create fuels 
such as biohydrogen, biomethanol, biohy­
drogen diesel, mixed alcohols, and wood 
diesel.
	✓	Third generation: More recently, atten­
tion has turned to algae as a feedstock for 
biofuel. It has the potential to yield 30 to 40 
times as much energy per acre than land 
crops. Even more remote is the idea of using 
fungi to generate biodiesel: www.wired.
com/wiredscience/2008/11/
rainforest-fung. Potential is the key 
word as companies work to unlock the best 
way to harvest this energy. 
Advanced technology and experimentation 
now allow scientists to determine the net 
energy balance for various feedstock sources. 
To be viable, the amount of fuel created with a 
feedstock must be far greater than the energy 
required to grow, harvest, process, and trans­
port the fuel. 
According to a study by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture (USDA), corn-based ethanol, once 
the darling of the industry, produces 67 percent 
more energy than is required to grow, harvest, 
refine, and transport the fuel. Researchers 
from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln grew 
switchgrass and found that biofuel from switch­
grass produced 540 percent more energy than 
was required to produce it. (Fossil fuel gasoline 
is rated as a negative 19 percent, meaning it 
takes more energy to produce the fuel than you 
get out of it. For additional comparison ratings 
for various biofuels, visit http://help
fuelthefuture.org/web/content/
view/20/35).
To thrive, the biofuels industry must resolve 
several issues. First, biofuel feedstock must 
be grown in a way that doesn’t negatively 
impact food crops, the soil, or the surrounding 
environment. One solution is to include waste 
sources as feedstock (see the earlier section 
”Converting Waste into Energy”). The Rocky 
Mountain Institute reports that biofuels can 
be created in a sustainable fashion as long as 
growing sites are chosen with care. Second, 
in addition to having a favorable net energy 
balance, biofuels must be produced by meth­
ods that ensure the best price and the lowest 
carbon emissions. The final hurdles for the 
industry are scaling (expanding) the favored 
production process to produce large quanti­
ties of fuel to meet demand at a cost-effective 
price and creating cost-effective distribution 
systems.
Currently 170 ethanol biorefinery plants exist 
in 26 states, with a high concentration in 
the Midwest (www.ethanolrfa.org/
industry/locations). If you’re inter­
ested in this industry, you may also want to 
track developments on Earth2Tech’s Biofuel 
Deathwatch Map, www.earth2tech.
com/maps, which tracks projects on hold due 
to funding issues and industry trends. In 2008 
America’s ethanol industry produced 9 billion 
gallons of ethanol and is expected to produce 

129
 Chapter 9: Angling for Jobs in Alternative Energy
10 billion gallons in 2009, 9 percent of the U.S. 
gasoline supply. Various blends of ethanol are 
in use. Biodiesel is also becoming more readily 
available.
The Renewable Fuel Standard program 
(www.epa.gov/OMS/renewable
fuels/420f09023.htm), run by the EPA 
under the Energy Independence and Security 
Act of 2007, requires that a certain percentage 
of renewable fuel be blended with gasoline. 
In May 2009 the EPA announced new regula­
tions for each year from 2010 to 2022 to extend 
the first Renewable Fuel Standards originally 
established in 2005. The proposed ruling speci­
fies volume standards for cellulosic biofuel, 
biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuel, 
and total renewable fuel that must be used in 
transportation fuel each year. For the first time, 
greenhouse gas emissions thresholds have 
been set for each kind of biofuel. Requirements 
defined in this regulation will apply to domestic 
and foreign producers and importers and cover 
all transportation fuel, which includes gasoline 
and diesel fuel used in highway vehicles and 
engines, as well as locomotive and marine 
engines.
If these changes to the Renewable Fuel 
Standard are approved, the biofuels industry 
is likely to grow and develop. Using funds from 
the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, 
the DOE is investing $786.5 million in advanced 
biofuels research and development and com­
mitting $480 million to demonstration-scale 
projects called integrated biorefineries that 
produce advanced biofuels, biobased prod­
ucts, power, and heat from the same plant. In 
addition, $176.5 million has been dedicated to 
several commercial-scale biorefinery projects 
that are under construction.

Geothermal
Geothermal energy taps the heat from the core of the Earth to generate elec­
tricity and provide heating and cooling applications. Geothermal energy is a 
clean, reliable, renewable resource available throughout the world. Estimates 
suggest that the Earth’s heat translates to 42 million megawatts of energy, 
which is said to be a virtually unlimited source of energy.
Geothermal energy is divided into three categories:
	
✓	Geothermal electricity production: Drilled wells bring hot water from 
geothermal reservoirs to the surface of the Earth where the heat is con­
verted to electricity at a geothermal power plant.
	
✓	Geothermal direct use: Hot water from the Earth is used directly with­
out converting it to electricity. Examples include heating/cooling individ­
ual buildings or districts, melting snow on roads, bridges, and sidewalks, 
heating greenhouses, drying crops, and using it in spas, agriculture, and 
aquaculture.
	
✓	Geothermal heat pumps: Continuous closed-loop pipes run under­
ground and then back through the adjacent building. The constant tem­
perature of the ground transfers to the water or substance in the pipes. 
On cold days the water is circulated throughout the building to provide 
warmth. On hot days, the process is reversed to take the heat from the 
room. The Environmental Protection Agency considers this technology 
to be the most efficient heating and cooling system available. (See page 
18, www.zebralliance.com/docs/geothermal_report_12-08.
pdf, or www.newportgeo.com.)

Industry’s Current Status
According to the Geothermal Energy Association’s May 2007 interim report 
(www.geo-energy.org/publications/reports/GEA%20World%20
Update%202007.pdf), 24 countries convert geothermal energy to electric 
power, and another 22 plan to start doing so by 2010. In 2007 the U.S. was 
the largest producer of geothermal energy in the world, generating 14,885 
GWh (gigawatt-hours) of electricity. See Geothermal 101 for more details. 
Geothermal heat pump installations and direct use applications are also 
increasing. 
Current technology is scalable. Larger plants can service larger communities, 
and smaller plants are adequate for smaller communities. The key hurdles 
to building geothermal power plants are construction capital and overcom­
ing the financial risks of searching for the proper geological configurations. 
Operating costs are reasonable and do not fluctuate. The geothermal indus­
try will develop where the Earth’s geothermal resources are most abundant. 
Within the United States, the majority of geothermal activity is in 13 Western 
states, including Hawaii and Alaska. As of August 2008, these states had 103 
geothermal energy plants in development for almost 4 GW (gigawatts).
Rating
The geothermal industry is maturing. Plants are in place, and the technology 
is perfected. Challenges to expansion relate to identifying new geothermal 
sites and ensuring that the necessary equipment is available when needed. 
Future trends (and caveats)
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has provided a number 
of valuable incentives to the geothermal energy industry. Production tax cred­
its, investment tax credits, and grants are available for projects that will be 
in service by December 2013. Homeowners will receive a tax credit of up to 
$2,000 for qualified geothermal heat pumps. A similar tax credit incentive has 
contributed significantly to the growth of the residential solar industry.
	
Technological advances are expected to reduce the costs and risks of using 
geothermal energy. Some of the technologies to watch can be found at www.
geo-energy.org/aboutGE/basics.asp.
Issues that must continue to be addressed by the industry include maintain­
ing the quality of drinking water near geothermal plants, finding ways to 
sequester the carbon released by geothermal processing, and minimizing 
earthquakes that may occur while creating new geothermal plants.

Hydrogen: An industry to watch
Hydrogen (H2) is the most abundant element in the 
universe. It is a light, odorless, colorless gas that 
stores and delivers energy in an easy-to-access 
form. When used, hydrogen power produces 
two by-products: heat and water. Many refer to 
hydrogen as a universal fuel because it can be 
produced in a number of ways, depending on the 
resources locally available. Issues surrounding 
the hydrogen industry include the following:
	✓	To determine whether hydrogen is renew­
able, look at the production process used to 
create the hydrogen. If a renewable energy 
source such as solar energy, wind, or bio­
fuels, is used, then the hydrogen is indeed 
considered green, or renewable. If coal or 
natural gas are used to produce hydrogen, 
the end result is decidedly not green in 
nature. 
	✓	Although it takes more energy to pro­
duce and distribute hydrogen than it does 
for gasoline fuel, hydrogen combustion 
engines (HCEs) and fuel cells are far more 
efficient than the traditional combustion 
engines, which means they need to use 
less fuel to travel the same distance.
	✓	Applications for fuel cell technology are 
growing in the area of stationary power 
sources, specialty vehicles such as forklifts, 
and portable power for emergency backup.
	✓	As hydrogen evolves, forecasts indicate 
a move toward electricity generation for 
buildings on the grid and in remote loca­
tions, portable consumer electronics 
devices, military applications, and vehicles, 
from two- and three-wheelers to delivery 
trucks and buses.
Hydrogen proponents’ vision of a hydrogen-
based economy includes using fuel cells as an 
efficient, versatile way to power a variety of 
applications. If we switched to hydrogen tech­
nology, internal combustion engines, turbines, 
and batteries would go the way of the horse 
and buggy. For the move to a hydrogen-based 
economy to happen, several key issues must be 
addressed: 
	✓	The methods for producing hydrogen from 
green, renewable, domestic sources must 
be identified and perfected. 
	✓	Costs to the user must be ascertained. The 
DOE is targeting a cost of $2–$3 per gallon 
of gasoline equivalent; current technology 
produces hydrogen at a cost of $3–$6 per 
gallon of gasoline equivalent.  
	✓	Distribution of hydrogen and the associated 
infrastructure must be resolved. Current 
estimates indicate that $9 billion to $15 
billion dollars would be required to build 
hydrogen stations to support 1 million fuel 
cell electric cars in the top 100 metro areas. 
If built out according to this plan, 70 percent 
of the U.S. would live within two miles of the 
nearest hydrogen station.

Solar
Sunlight is the source of most renewable energy power. By incorporating 
solar into our energy mix, we have access to a very reliable, abundant, acces­
sible source of energy that can be produced domestically with little or no 
impact on the environment. The solar industry is generally divided into resi­
dential, commercial, and large utility-scale projects. Although the basic solar 
principles are the same in each of these applications, the equipment that is 
deemed most efficient and cost-effective varies by application.
	
✓	Solar electricity: Sunlight is converted directly into electricity with 
the use of photovoltaic (PV) technology. Rooftop solar arrays are built 
according to the size of the project. Thin-film solar, a competing technol­
ogy, is often referred to as CIGS, for the chemicals — copper, indium, 
gallium and (di)selenide — used to absorb light. Some companies are 
already offering roof tiles that have embedded PV qualities. Solar elec­
tricity is a viable energy source for a wide range of situations, from small 
consumer items, to remote buildings and equipment, to solar farms that 
cover thousands of acres. Electricity from solar projects can charge bat­
teries and contribute to the grid. 
	
✓	Solar heating: Solar thermal systems harness the power of the sun to 
heat liquids that then transfer the heat to a building, swimming pool, 
or household water needs. These systems are either passive, where the 
system is designed to move the liquid through a loop, or active, where a 
pump is installed to force the water somewhere else. Some systems are 
direct, in that the water itself is moved through the solar thermal equip­
ment, whereas other systems are indirect and have another substance 
run through the loop. 
	
✓	Concentrating solar power (CSP): Typically used in utility-scale proj­
ects, CSP uses a large array of mirrors to focus sunlight onto receivers. 
As the receivers collect the solar energy, they convert it to heat. Several 
designs are in use, including a mirrored dish, a power tower with mir­
rors encircling the tower, and linear trough systems. 
Industry’s current status 
The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), often referred 
to as the bailout package, included several key wins for the solar industry. 
Enhanced tax credits for investors and homeowners provide a much-needed 
long-term framework for the industry. This stability is likely to help the indus­
try grow. For more details on the status of the overall solar industry and 
by technology and by state, see www.seia.org/galleries/pdf/2008_
Year_in_Review-small.pdf.

 Chapter 9: Angling for Jobs in Alternative Energy
States and municipalities with incentive programs above and beyond the fed­
eral rebates are seeing tremendous growth in photovoltaic installations. As I 
write this, New Jersey had just moved ahead of California in PV installations. 
Solar installers in Pennsylvania, New York, Colorado, and Delaware are also 
benefiting from generous rebates. Florida and southern Texas are seeing a 
jump in thermal solar. States are likely to change positions in the rankings as 
new rebates are approved in different areas. 
Global competition is heating up in the solar industry, from manufacturing to 
installation in each technology area. Key players are Europe, the U.S., Japan, 
and China. The market climate in each of these countries and regions is 
impacting how this industry is developing.
	
The highest potential for domestic solar power is in the Southwest region 
of the United States (see www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html). Scroll down 
on that pages for detailed maps of various solar technologies within the U.S. 
For a map of solar potential globally, visit www.solar4power.com/
map1-global-solar-power.html.
Rating
The solar industry is growing and developing. Technology exists to create 
solar power at the residential and utility level, and research and development 
continues to push toward more efficient technology. As the industry matures, 
key technologies will become standard, and others are likely to drop away.
Future trends (and caveats)
As with other renewable energy industries, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act is providing a financial infusion into the solar industry 
through investments in research and development, demonstration projects, 
and commercial projects. Grants at the commercial level and tax credits for 
residential solar installations motivate activity. 
To break through to the next level of production, the solar industry must find 
ways to deliver solar electricity into the electric grid through high-voltage 
transmission lines. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) at 
www.nrel.gov/pv is dedicating part of its research agenda to defining and 
resolving the regulatory, technical, and economic barriers to this integration. 
For more about this topic, see Chapter 10.
The NREL is also searching for ways to improve the efficiency of thin-film 
solar and concentrator technology and integrate solar technology into build­
ing materials from shingles to paint. Nanosolar’s thin-film technology is also 
garnering interest as new developments allow the company to print solar 

136

cells on very thin foil (www.nanosolar.com/technology). As the thin-film 
industry takes off, expect to see new solar energy collection systems.
As the solar industry looks to build more utility-scale solar farms and CSP 
installations, land access and land use issues must be resolved. Public lands in 
the Southwest, managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), continue 
to be prime territory for large-scale solar projects. In 2008, the BLM launched a 
two-year study that’s likely to speed up application processing in the future.

Tidal and Marine
The oceans, which cover 70 percent of the earth’s surface, are constantly 
in motion due to lunar phases, gravity, tides, wind, and solar heating of 
the water’s surface. That movement provides a promising source of renew­
able, non-polluting electricity. Energy can be pulled from oceans in the 
following ways. Each source has benefits that are unique to the correspond­
ing technology:
Low-impact hydropower
Historically, hydroelectric power plants 
have come in the form of large-scale dams. 
Although the energy they produce is deemed 
clean, renewable energy, the impact of the 
dams during construction and operation has 
not always been environmentally sound. 
Nevertheless, hydropower plants contribute 
one-fifth of the world’s energy, and hydropower 
is the major source of power for 55 countries.
As the impact of climate change started becom­
ing apparent, the hydropower industry took on 
the challenge to find more sustainable ways to 
provide power. The following list includes sev­
eral key initiatives that address the sustainabil­
ity of hydropower: 
	✓	The Sustainable Hydropower Web site pro­
vides an in-depth look at the advantages 
and disadvantages of hydropower from 
an economic, social, and environmental 
point of view. Visit www.sustainable
hydropower.org and click on the seg­
ments of the globe to dig into issues and 
solutions. For a chart of the strengths and 
weaknesses of the technology, click on 
the About Sustainability in the Hydropower 
Industry link at the top of the home page.
	✓	The non-profit Low Impact Hydropower 
Institute (LIHI) is working to reduce the 
impact of hydropower plants by certifying 
projects that have reduced their environ­
mental impact. The certification allows 
consumers to support hydropower dams 
that become more environmentally sound. 
For more, see www.lowimpacthydro.
org/content/about.aspx. While 
you’re on the site, check out the project 
map and list of certified projects and proj­
ects that are moving through the applica­
tion process. 
	✓	Small-scale or micro hydro technologies are 
also gaining popularity because they have 
little to no impact on the surrounding envi­
ronment. These systems capture the power 
of river flow without altering or interfering 
with the river — just as mills used to do. 
Typically these systems produce up to 300 
kilowatts. Micro hydro projects are in place 
around the world, often in areas that couldn’t 
afford a larger facility. For more about 
this sector, see www.alternative-
energy-news.info/micro-

✓	Tidal energy: Energy can be captured and converted to electricity as 
tidal waters move into and out of a bay. Although electrical power gener­
ated from tidal action is cyclical, with two high and two low tides each 
day and no generation at the six-hour mark in between, the peaks in pro­
duction are predictable and reliable. This sort of energy is best suited to 
displace electricity that would have been generated by fossil fuels. 
	
✓	Wave power: As waves move, the change in their height and speed 
creates energy. The Ocean Energy Council calculates that “an aver­
age 4-foot, 10-second wave striking a coast puts out more than 35,000 
horsepower per mile of coast.” (One horsepower is equal to a little over 
700 watts — meaning one wave has the energy of 24 megawatts (MW). 
Using one of a variety of devices (buoys, floats, oscillating water column 
devices, or a tapered channel), the wave’s movement can be added to 
the electric grid. 
	
✓	Ocean current energy: This source of energy takes advantage of strong 
currents that occur naturally between islands, near headlands, and at 
the entrances of bays and harbors. Underwater turbines capture the 
energy created by currents that have a velocity of 5 or more knots. 
	
✓	Ocean thermocline energy (OTEC): This method relies on temperature 
differences between the warm water on the surface of the ocean and 
the cold water at deeper depths. By building thermal energy conversion 
plants in areas with a large temperature differential, surface water can 
be used to create steam which is passed through a turbine generator to 
make electricity. Although costly to build, such a plant can continually 
produce clean, renewable electricity. And after the warm or cold water 
has been pumped into the system, it can be used for other purposes, 
including air conditioning, desalination, and aquaculture.
See www.oceanenergycouncil.com/index.php/Tidal-Energy/What-
is-Ocean-Energy.html for more on each of these power sources. 
Industry’s current status 
The good news about tidal power is that the technology required to capture 
power from the ocean is well developed and is very similar to technology 
used by hydroelectric plants for the last 120 years. The more challenging 
part of the story is the construction itself. Oceanic projects require a large 
investment of time and money, with construction lasting as long as ten years. 
Nevertheless, companies, utilities, and governments are actively working on 
projects around the world. The location of the early adopters depends on the 
geological phenomenon needed to leverage each type of technology:

139
 Chapter 9: Angling for Jobs in Alternative Energy
	
✓	Tidal energy: Operating a tidal energy operation requires a difference 
of at least 7 meters between the low and the high tide. Several tidal 
power plants exist now on the northern coast of France, in the Bay of 
Fundy in Nova Scotia, near Murmansk in Russia, and several locations 
in China. Research studies point to several other promising locations, 
including Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Maine, the Severn River 
in England, and the White Sea of Russia. If we could harness tidal power 
around the world, we could generate 64,000 MW of power. 
	
✓	Wave power: Wave power plants are most likely to be sited on western 
coastlines that experience fast series of pounding waves. In keeping with 
this fact, WaveGen (www.wavegen.co.uk) built the first commercial-
scale wave power plant in the Isle of Islay, Scotland. Other projects are 
underway around the globe in countries such as Portugal, Norway, the 
U.S., China, Japan, Australia, and India. The U.S. alone could produce 23 
GW from wave power.
	
✓	Ocean current energy: To capture energy from ocean currents, the cur­
rent must be moving at 5 knots or more. Various areas around the world 
including the UK, Italy, Japan, the Philippines, the Florida Current, and 
the Gulf Stream are well suited for this industry. In 2000, Blue Energy, 
Inc., estimated the power from this energy source to exceed 450 GW.
	
✓	Ocean thermocline energy (OTEC): This technology is typically most 
effective near the equator where the warm shallow waters around an 
island drop off dramatically to deep waters with cold temperatures. 
Although studied by scientists since the late 1800s, only a few plants 
have been constructed — off Hawaii, India, and Guam. 
	
Experts say that the ocean energy industry is where wind power was in the 
early 1980s, when many technical designs were in play and no clear indica­
tion of the ultimate direction of the industry was apparent. The ocean energy 
industry has a couple advantages over the early years of the wind industry, 
however. The cost per unit of energy is already competitive with wind, lower 
than solar, and expected to drop farther. In addition, the development of 
industry standards is progressing more quickly than in wind, shortening the 
time between product prototype and commercialization. 
Rating
Although some ocean power technologies are more mature than others, the 
industry as a whole is still in early stages of development. 

140
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
Future trends (and caveats) 
Although the industry is not yet ready for large-scale development, there are 
some positive signs that the industry is progressing. The capital costs per net 
kilowatt compete with wind projects and are lower than solar power projects. 
Growth potential is also projected to be quite promising. In a report entitled 
Forecasting the Future of Ocean Power, Daniel Englander and Travis Bradford 
forecast the ocean power industry can move from the current 10 MW installed 
capacity to over 1 GW over a span of six years. They estimate the annual 
market for this industry to be $500 million and that more than $2 billion will 
be invested to manufacture and install these ocean power plants. Several 
large corporations, including G.E., Chevron, and Shell, are investing in ocean 
power companies. For a summary of this report, see www.gtmresearch.

To thrive, the ocean power industry needs the same kinds of support that the 
solar and wind industries have been receiving. 
	
✓	Financing is of key importance. As an early-stage industry with promise, 
funds are needed for technological research, testing devices in ocean 
settings, and building demonstration projects to increase awareness of 
the industry and encourage commercial projects. 
	
✓	The industry could also use some assistance to smooth out the environ­
mental impact studies, planning requirements, and the permit process. 
The bureaucratic nature of the process is causing undue delays and put­
ting the U.S. behind many other countries. 
	
✓	As carbon regulations take form, it’s critical that ocean power be 
included as a viable source of clean energy. Adding it to clean energy 
incentive programs such as the Renewable Energy Portfolio would open 
up options for utilities that must provide a certain percentage of renew­
able energy to their customers.
	
Companies working in this industry must conduct studies and make adjust­
ments as needed to minimize the impact on wildlife. Although questions and 
concerns about the environmental impact of capturing the power of the sea 
exist, several early studies indicate that the impact is minimal. Another chal­
lenge for this industry is determining the best way to build machinery to with­
stand hostile undersea conditions. The industry will need to rely on software 
simulations and precise engineering to discover the most effective building 
methodologies. In the early stages, companies may need to develop their own 
equipment or modify equipment used in offshore drilling.

Wind
As the sun heats different parts of the earth at different rates, hot air rises and 
cooler air is drawn in to replace the warmer rising air. The result is wind — 
which can be converted into electricity. Wind is inexhaustible, affordable, and 
is fairly predictable in certain regions of the world. Wind energy has been har­
nessed for centuries (have a look at old Dutch paintings). 

142
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
The most common modern turbines have a propeller design and can be up 
to 300 feet tall with turbine blades that are 65 to 130 feet long. The amount of 
energy collected from wind depends on the size of the wind turbine and the 
speed of the wind moving the rotor. As the wind moves the turbine blades, 
they turn a gearbox and electrical generator to produce electricity.
Industry’s current status 
Although the economic crisis of 2008–2009 slowed the growth of the wind 
industry, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act included a number of 
financial incentives for future wind power installations. Experts predict that 
wind power installations will exceed 2008 growth within a few years. 
As of April 2009, the United States became the world leader in wind with 28.6 
GW of installed capacity. These installed wind farms were projected to gener­
ate over 60 billion kWh of electricity in 2009, which would power over 5.5 mil­
lion homes. Industry experts forecast that wind power is capable of providing 
20 percent of the energy of the United States by 2030. For more information, 
see http://www.awea.org/newsroom/releases/year_end_wrap_
up_22dec08.html. For a look at how the wind industry has evolved in the 
U.S. over the last decade, see www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_
installed_capacity.asp.
Europe and China are the other wind powers. In 2008, China’s wind power 
capacity doubled for the fourth year in a row. Chinese manufacturing produc­
tion is expanding as well. 
Rating
The wind industry is growing. Safety guidelines and manufacturing guidelines 
for utility-scale and small-scale wind turbines are likely as the wind industry 
matures. 
Future trends (and caveats)
Wind turbines are immense machines full of finely machined parts. The 
industry depends on the availability of several key ingredients: steel, large-
scale manufacturing equipment, heavy-duty transportation, and experienced 
workers. In addition, the success of the wind industry, and many other 

143
 Chapter 9: Angling for Jobs in Alternative Energy
renewable energy sources, depends on the creation of a new electric grid 
that provides for the transmission of electricity from renewable sources in all 
parts of the country.
Small-scale wind power systems are those that generate up to 100 kW of 
electricity. Residential units are also gaining popularity and produce up to 1 
kW. With a federal-level investment tax credit of 30 percent of installed costs 
available through December 2016, consumers are expected to purchase more 
small wind turbines for their homes, businesses, and farms. Community wind 
farms are likely to gain appeal.
	
The next frontier for wind may be offshore. One glance at the wind resource 
map (www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_maps.asp) that includes 
coastal wind resources demonstrates why. Although the costs of offshore 
wind are higher upfront, windier conditions at sea produce more energy 
than on land. Offshore wind farms are also likely to be near urban centers. 
Generating wind where it is used reduces the cost of transmission. Although 
not feasible yet, it may be possible to set up floating wind farms in the future. 
Sample job functions 
	
✓	Mechanical, electrical, and aeronautical engineers with advanced 
degrees, and experienced technicians work together to conduct 
research and development to improve wind turbines and their capacity.
	
✓	Meteorologists help engineers identify the best sites for wind farms.
	
✓	Project development managers, transmission design engineers, and util­
ity wind-program managers work on turning a potential wind site into 
a fully functional wind farm. In addition to technical knowledge, the 
people in these roles must be able to work diplomatically with the local 
utility, elected officials in the region, and community members.
	
✓	Manufacturing plants with skilled machinists and welders create the 
components of the wind turbine.
	
✓	Construction managers and workers build and install the wind turbines.
	
✓	Large-load transportation specialists transport extremely large turbine 
blades to the wind farm site.
	
✓	Mechanical and electrical technicians, called windsmiths or wind techni­
cians, keep the wind turbines working effectively.
	
✓	Wind turbine sales managers and specialists sell the wind turbines.

O
ur world consists of an array of interrelated systems, sectors, and pro­
cesses that consume a lot of energy, create a tremendous amount of 
waste, and incorporate materials that are actually hazardous to our health 
when they aren’t handled properly. To make a dent in our impact on the 
planet, these industry sectors must become more sustainable. The sooner 
the better. 
The sections in this chapter refer to different sectors of our economy. As a 
result, the profiles in this chapter include a collection of interrelated indus­
tries that must collaborate to green their processes. Although some sectors 
are just beginning their green adventure, others are making great strides. The 
trends highlighted in this chapter provide a sampling of what’s happening 
in the overall sector. As you drill down into each industry, you will discover 
even more trends that deserve your attention.

Green Building
According to the U.S. Green Building Council, residential homes and com­
mercial buildings consume 72 percent of the country’s electricity, 39 percent 
of all energy sources, 40 percent of the raw materials, and 14 percent of the 
potable water. Buildings emit 38 percent of the country’s carbon dioxide and 
produce 30 percent of the country’s waste.
To counteract these effects, the building industry is becoming more and 
more dedicated to building green, sustainable structures. Changes are being 
implemented throughout the process, from rethinking how building materials 
and supplies are manufactured to how buildings are constructed, decorated, 
and maintained. The benefits of green building are many. The environment is 
better off as natural resources are used more effectively, and the surrounding 
areas are improved by better air and water quality and less waste. The build­
ing owners and renters save money because operating these building is less 
costly. The people who live and work in the buildings are generally healthier, 
more productive, and more comfortable.
Cleantech
According to the Cleantech Group, the origina­
tors of the term cleantech, “determining what is 
or isn’t cleantech isn’t always easy.” When key 
industry experts don’t agree on a single defini­
tion and they continue to tweak the description 
as the scope of the sectors evolves, you know 
that you are on the frontlines of innovation. A 
few definitions of cleantech follow.
Clean Edge (www.cleanedge.com), a 
cleantech research firm: “A diverse range of 
products, services, and processes that harness 
renewable materials and energy sources, dra­
matically reduce the use of natural resources, 
and cut or eliminate emissions and wastes.”
Pernick and Wilder, authors of The Clean 
Tech Revolution: The Next Big Growth and 
Investment Opportunity: “Any product, service, 
or process that delivers value using limited or 
zero non-renewable resources and/or cre­
ates significantly less waste than conventional 
offerings.”
The Cleantech Group, a network of entrepre­
neurs and investors, http://cleantech.
com/about/cleantechdefinition.
cfm: “… cleantech represents a diverse 
range of products, services, and processes, 
all intended to: provide superior performance 
at lower costs, while greatly reducing or elimi­
nating negative ecological impact, at the same 
time as improving the productive and respon­
sible use of natural resources.”

 Chapter 10: Careers in Rebuilding the Infrastructure
The greening of the building industry is occurring in the following areas: 
	
✓	Architecture: Those who design buildings try to find innovative solu­
tions that result in little impact on the environment. Green roofs handle 
water runoff, insulate the building, and enhance the biodiversity of the 
local environment. More buildings are designed to generate their own 
power through a variety of methods. Waste water that used to flow into 
the sewer system is divided into true waste and gray water. Gray water 
can be used to flush toilets and water the garden. Rain water that used 
to travel to the gutter is now stored for other uses. 
	
✓	Building supplies and materials: All the materials, such as roofing, 
windows, doors, foundations, insulations, paints and plumbing, used in 
building new construction and remodeling projects must be built from 
sustainable materials with green manufacturing processes. 
	
✓	New construction and remodeling: Contractors seek new knowledge, 
skills, and experience to implement the architect’s plans while finding 
innovative ways to manage the building industry’s waste stream. 
	
✓	Energy-efficiency audits and retrofitting: A new emphasis in the build­
ing trade is evolving to assess the environmental impact of existing 
buildings and to retrofit them to be more energy efficient.
	
✓	Interior design: Choosing the materials used to create the interior ambi­
ence of a building is just as important as the structure itself. 
	
✓	Furnishings: Interior decorations must also be built sustainably, includ­
ing furniture, window coverings, flooring, and lighting. 
	
✓	Landscaping: With care and forethought, landscaping can decrease the 
energy used to heat, cool, and light a building. Water usage, waste man­
agement, and buying locally benefit green landscapers.
Industry’s current status 
The Architecture 2030 Challenge was founded by the architect Edward Mazria 
in 2002 to transform the building industry from being a contributor to green-
house gas emissions to being part of the solution (www.architecture2030.
org/2030_challenge). Buildings require a huge amount of power to build 
and operate. When that power is provided through coal-burning plants, the 
result is massive amounts of greenhouse gases that contribute to global 
warming. Reducing the power needed to build and operate buildings reduces 
greenhouse gas emissions. The Architecture 2030 Challenge asks all architects 
and building professionals to design, build, and retrofit buildings to emit 50 
percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than typical buildings of the same 
variety until, over time, that percentage increases and buildings are carbon 
neutral in 2030.

148
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification 
system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council in 1998 provides all 
building professionals with a framework to create buildings that save energy, 
conserve water, improve indoor air quality, and reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. Professionals can earn a certification in building construction, 
homes, interior design, operations, neighborhood development, and more. 
If you’re interested in sitting for your certification, visit the Green Building 
Certification Institute: www.gbci.org.
The U.S. Green Building Council worked with the American Society of Interior 
Designers to create the REGREEN guidelines for residential remodeling proj­
ects (www.regreenprogram.org). This program provides information 
about building strategies and products. 
Energy efficiency pros use a whole-house systems approach to assess energy 
efficiency of homes based on air leaks, insulation quality, cooling and heat­
ing systems, and lighting and appliances. Auditors use the data in steps to 
make a home more efficient. For more: www.energystar.gov/index.

Green computing, green IT
Computers are energy hogs. And it takes nearly 
the same energy to power data centers and 
computers as it does to keep the systems cool. 
In 2007 the EPA noted that by 2011 data centers 
were likely to use twice as much power as they 
did in 2006. That energy amounts to 1.5 percent 
of total U.S. power usage, or $4.5 billion! The 
good news is that it’s possible to cut power 
needs and cut costs dramatically, at the same 
time. The bad news is that only 25 percent of 
data center operators have a plan to reduce 
energy usage. Many organizations expect to 
build more facilities that will eat up even more 
energy. As energy costs go up and power 
capacity becomes limited, companies are likely 
to shift their thinking, if not for the environment, 
then for their own survival.
Green computing, also called green IT, is 
making strides in the following areas: 
	✓	Energy efficiency and power utilization: 
From data centers and virtualization to PCs, 
printers, and networks, equipment is being 
developed to use less power more effi­
ciently. 
	✓	Materials and product design: Computer 
equipment itself is being redesigned with a 
closer eye toward energy-efficient operations 
and the materials being used in production. 
	✓	Supply chain: Innovative companies go 
back to the source to verify that all materi­
als meet their environmental standards and 
are extracted and processed with integrity.
	✓	Procurement: Companies that purchase 
large quantities of computer equipment 
have a huge opportunity to become more 
sustainable. The EPA’s Energy Star program 
(www.energystar.gov) ensures that 
computer equipment meets government 
standards for energy efficiency. In 2009 
these standards were extended to include 
servers, networks, routers, and other 
hardware. The Green Electronics Council 
recently extended its U.S.-based Electronic 
Product Environmental Assessment Tool 
(EPEAT) to computer equipment in 40 coun­
tries. Now buyers can factor environmental 
impact into their decisions. 
	✓	Disposal: Each piece of computer equipment 
contains hazardous chemicals and materials 
that cannot be tossed in a landfill. Standards 
are emerging to ensure proper disposal. 
Some companies dismantle equipment and 
reuse materials. The cost of the disposal pro­
cess must be factored into the equation when 
purchasing electronic equipment.
Green IT 2.0 is right around the corner. The 
quest for higher energy efficiency, lower 
carbon emissions, and lower costs will 
become an integrated part of the IT mission 
(see www.greenercomputing.com/
blog/2009/09/08/get-ready-
green-it-20). For other trends likely to 
impact IT, read the “Smart Grid” section in 
this chapter. For more information about green

 Chapter 10: Careers in Rebuilding the Infrastructure
Manufacturing
The manufacturing sector converts raw materials into finished goods, which 
may then be used in downstream products ultimately sold to the consumer. 
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, “Sustainable manufacturing is 
defined as the creation of manufactured products that use processes that are 
non-polluting, conserve energy and natural resources, and are economically 
sound and safe for employees, communities, and consumers.” The goods may 
have green uses, such as solar panels or green building supplies, or they may 
be traditional goods produced sustainably, such as toothpaste and carpet tiles.
Green manufacturing follows a cradle to cradle model, where materials from 
outdated models becomes an input to the production process. Manufacturers 
must review all the following components of the process: 
	
✓	Extracting and processing raw materials for the manufacturing process
	
✓	Manufacturing and producing the products
	
✓	Moving materials and finished products to their intended locations 
	
✓	Using the products
	
✓	Maintaining and repairing the products
	
✓	Reusing and recycling when parts become broken or obsolete 
Obviously, this transformation doesn’t happen overnight. Materials, prod­
ucts, manufacturing systems, factories, and distribution must all be rede­
signed. Some products may be redesigned to allow the final product to 
biodegrade more easily. Other products may be disassembled and the parts 
reused in manufacturing. Sustainable design applies a triple bottom line phi­
losophy (profit, social responsibility, and environmental impact). 
Industry’s current status 
Sustainable manufacturing is currently the key issue for the manufactur­
ing sector. According to an Eye for Transport report, 95 percent of execu­
tives surveyed indicated that the trend toward green manufacturing will 
continue. Furthermore, 71 percent noted that costs to green their process 
were decreasing, and 43 percent were experiencing higher product quality 
and manufacturing efficiencies by moving to a green manufacturing process. 
But a survey conducted by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers found 
that only 16 percent of 1,046 manufacturing professionals understood what 
environmental footprint meant. Clearly, there’s a ways to go before the entire 
manufacturing sector is completely onboard with this growing trend. 
The U.S. isn’t the only one either. China is taking the lead in sectors such as 
the electric car and solar, fueled by the country’s enormous energy needs.

152

Rating
Although the manufacturing sector is mature (and some might say fading into 
the sunset), green, sustainable manufacturing is emerging.
Future trends (and caveats)
When manufacturers must account for the carbon footprint of the entire 
manufacturing process, the sector will need to shift its practices dramati­
cally to remain financially viable. Companies that make efforts to green their 
manufacturing process voluntarily will be ahead of the curve. A major educa­
tional initiative must be implemented so that workers at all level understand 
what’s at stake and what they can do to be more sustainable in their own 
actions to conserve energy and eliminate waste for the company. 
One trend to keep an eye on is the role nanotechnology (very tiny manufac­
turing) will play. Creating non-toxic materials without hazardous substances 
is commendable. Who doesn’t want to see fewer chemicals used in the manu­
facturing process? The trouble is, no one is quite sure yet what, if any, are 
the side effects of nanotechnology. Several organizations are studying the 
issue, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the University of 
Alabama’s Center for Green Manufacturing.

Printing and publishing
Books, magazines, newspapers, marketing 
pieces, and packaging have a significant impact 
on landfills and our natural resources. The 
world would stop functioning without paper, 
and the printing and publishing industries are 
well aware of the issues at hand. Choices are 
being made at each step of the publishing pro­
cess to reduce the industry’s impact on the 
environment:
	✓	Design of project: Some graphic, prod­
uct, and packaging designers are making 
choices at the earliest stages of their proj­
ects to minimize environmental impact. 
Products and packaging are being designed 
to reduce production, waste, resources, 
toxics, and transportation: http://
sustainability.aiga.org/sus_
questions. Even fonts make a differ­
ence: Ecofont uses 20 percent less ink than 
conventional fonts: www.greentaxi.
com/green-font/.
	✓	Supply chain: Paper source is a critical 
part of greening the industry. Is the supply 
from sustainable forests, how is the land 
impacted, how is the health of the people 
in surrounding areas affected, how is the 
local economy influenced? Take a look

Smart Grid
Electricity is such an integral part of our lives that we don’t think about it 
much — until there’s an outage. Then we realize just how much we depend 
on it. Although an outage is inconvenient to residents, it can be catastrophic 
for commercial and industrial entities who, according to the Electrical Power 
Research Institute (EPRI), lose $50 billion per year due to electric outages.
Given that our electric system was designed to generate, transmit, and dis­
tribute power from fossil fuels, we must make some significant changes to 
it to incorporate the renewable energy sources that will power our future. 
Thanks to decades of technological advancements, we’re in a position to 
transform every part of the delivery system, while adding technology to 
help users manage power consumption. According to the U.S. Department of 
Energy (DOE), the resulting infrastructure is predicted “to provide improved 
reliability, security, efficiency, and ultimately lower cost to the user.”
The term smart grid refers to an entire sector of our economy that will touch 
all of us in multiple ways. Before diving into the details, here’s an overview of 
the components of the electricity supply chain:
	
✓	Power generation: At the front end are a variety of methods for generat­
ing power. See Chapter 9 for detailed descriptions of these topics.
	✓	Distribution: Moving printed products 
to their final destination is part of the 
carbon footprint. See the section “Supply/
Distribution Logistics” for more on this.
The use of recycled paper has increased over 
the last few years (you’re holding one exam­
ple in your hands right now) — in fact, North 
American recycled paper manufacturers strug­
gle to meet the demand. The Environmental 
Paper Network is strengthening paper recovery 
standards to ensure that paper sent to recycling 
is of high enough quality to allow the paper 
fibers to be used in manufacturing recycled 
paper. See www.environmentalpaper.
org/repaperproject for more.
The Book Industry Environmental Council (BIEC) 
(www.bookcouncil.org) is addressing 
the environmental impact of the book publish­
ing industry. In addition to creating a target for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the group 
will also track the industry’s environmental 
impact and certify book publishers that are 
reducing their impact on the environment. For

✓	Power transmission: This portion of the supply chain moves high volt­
age electricity from one region to another.
	
✓	Power distribution: Distributing electricity from the substations to com­
mercial, industrial, and residential users is the focus here.
	
✓	Energy storage: It’s important to have the capability to store energy and 
use it when you need it. Utilities have always used a variety of storage 
systems such as compressed air, fly wheels, and banks of batteries for 
this reason. Residential and commercial users are beginning to see the 
need to store energy as well. The energy storage industry is developing 
various technologies to provide a wide range of storage equipment. 
	
✓	User consumption management: To use energy efficiently, residential, 
commercial, and industrial customers must be able to manage their own 
consumption. Software systems help manage energy usage in real time.
Several entities play critical roles in delivering electricity to power our world.
	
✓	Utilities: Each region receives its power from the local utility. You likely 
write yours a check each month for electricity and gas.
	
✓	Manufacturers: Companies manufacture an array of equipment and soft­
ware products for every phase of the electricity supply chain. 
	
✓	Making markets: Financial experts are creating new markets and models 
to sell energy because the old markets don’t work with the variety of 
energy sources that are being added to the electricity grid.
	
✓	Services: A variety of service providers will evolve as the smart grid 
transformation takes hold. It’s likely that consultants, systems integra­
tion specialists, and other professionals will play key roles. 
Industry’s current status 
Industry experts have known for some time that the electrical infrastructure 
in the U.S. was due for a major overhaul. The sheer costs, number of players, 
and inherent complexity of an end-to-end revision make this difficult. 
The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 referenced the smart 
grid. This bill and the $4.5 billion in funding from the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act have motivated key players to help rethink the electric 
grid. Major IT companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Cisco, are creating 
products and services to address smart grid issues.

Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
Several collaborative organizations have been formed to grapple with the 
myriad of issues associated with updating and reconfiguring our electric grid. 
Here are two you want to pay attention to: 
	
✓	Federal Smart Grid Task Force convened to coordinate smart grid 
actions by various departments of the federal government. 
	
✓	GridWise Alliance is a forum for smart grid stakeholders, from innova­
tive companies contributing new technology to those creating policy, 
from local utilities to the federal government.
When the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds were originally 
announced, the DOE capped the amount of funds that could go to various 
smart grid projects at a level that was too low for companies to begin the 
project. Then the grant caps were raised to $200 million for smart grid proj­
ects and up to $100 million for demonstration projects such as regional grid 
projects, utility-scale storage, and grid monitoring.
Stimulus money to the tune of $10 million has also gone to the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (www.nist.gov/smartgrid) to 
fund development of interoperability and cybersecurity standards. Vint Cerf, 
father of the Internet, sees the smart grid as the equivalent of an energy 
Internet. He believes, as do many, that the smart grid must be built with 
sophisticated standards that allow for transparency and security at all levels: 
http://earth2tech.com/2009/08/24/smart-grid-standards-road-
map-coming-soon-vint-cerf-weighs-in/. This road map of standards 
is critical to the transition to the smart grid. Latest standards were released 
in September 2009. These standards, that frankly look Greek to me, and per­
haps to you, allow various parts of the smart grid to communicate without 
any glitches and urge competing vendors to create interoperable hardware 
and software. 
Key findings from the DOE report indicate several critical advances are gain­
ing ground with great potential for growth, including smart meters (electric 
meters that allow for two-way transfer of pricing information, usage data, and 
electricity), distribution substation automation (remote monitoring and man­
agement), appliances that can automatically communicate with the grid to 
indicate energy needs and obtain energy pricing information, and distributed 
energy generation that is then stored for later use.
Rating
This is an emerging industry that has the potential to change our relationship 
with electricity from the ground up.

157
 Chapter 10: Careers in Rebuilding the Infrastructure
Future trends (and caveats)
The smart grid’s potential to change our world could be larger than the 
impact of both the Internet and the telecommunications revolutions. 
According to the DOE, for the smart grid to reach its full potential, a social/
cultural shift will be required. As real-time measurement of energy usage and 
automation are embedded in our world, we will develop a new relationship 
with electricity. If you think programming your VCR was hard, imagine having 
to set up all your appliances to communicate with the grid? Luckily, home 
energy management systems will give us one access point to manage all the 
things that go beep. 
The telecommunication industry sees an opening here as well. For various 
parts of the smart grid to communicate with one another, an embedded com­
munications system must be in place. Companies that power our cellphone 
communications are searching for ways to service the smart grid. 
Complex analytical modeling software is needed to assist utilities and energy 
traders in projecting shifts in supply and demand of electricity. For example, 
networking operating centers will need to adjust electricity sources more fre­
quently and manage energy coming from multiple sources, including intermit­
tent renewable energy sources like wind and solar and decentralized energy 
from residential generation. New challenges require new technology.
Look for more energy storage options, and moving the storage site to more 
decentralized locations such as substations, residences, and remote sites. 
Cars may also become a vehicle of choice for energy storage.
Regulations that have the possibility of shaping both the pace and direction 
of smart grid technologies focused on distributed generation and storage 
include
	
✓	Feed-in tariffs: With this regulation, utilities must buy back excess 
energy generated by distributed generation sources. Utilities will have 
to accommodate a bidirectional flow of electricity.
	
✓	Renewable portfolio standard: Currently, the percentage of electricity 
required to come from renewable sources varies by state. Creating a 
national renewable portfolio standard would stimulate renewable energy 
industries throughout the country.
Workforce forecasts for the utility industry project that a large percentage of 
their experienced employees will retire in the next few years. This translates 
to ample job opportunities if you prepare and train for this kind of work.

Supply/Distribution Logistics
Look around you. See anything that’s been manufactured or processed? If 
so, you are the recipient of the work of supply chain logistics specialists. 
Someone had to direct all the raw materials to the processing location, move 
partially finished inventory around the plant, distribute the product to the 
point of sale and then point of use. That’s a lot of moving and shuffling.

159
 Chapter 10: Careers in Rebuilding the Infrastructure
Logistics specialists work with a broad range of channel partners. To work 
in this field you may be an in-house employee for the manufacturer, supplier, 
transportation intermediary, or third-party logistics company. Or you might 
work for a consultancy. You may interact with people around the world or 
across town to procure supplies and distribute final products. 
In the past, logistics specialists focused on decreasing costs while bringing 
supplies and products to their location with just-in-time delivery. Now, many 
create sustainable supply chain management that achieves the same results, 
while minimizing the environmental impact of the process and being profit­
able. With so many moving parts in this process, there are numerous ways to 
minimize waste, cut energy use, decrease transportation costs, manage ware­
houses more effectively, and cut greenhouse gas emissions. 
Industry’s current status
Although the term supply chain is still used to describe this field, the better 
way to conceptualize it is to think of a vast network of suppliers spread 
throughout the world. To manage this multi-faceted system with numerous 
players efficiently, sophisticated software that allows all the players to under­
stand the supply and demand needs and status is critical. E2Open is a key 
player in this arena: www.e2open.com.
Three reports describe how the supply chain industry is responding to the 
push toward sustainable management. 
	
✓	The Carbon Efficient Supply Chain Report describes the current state 
of the industry and highlights future trends in the areas of measuring 
greenhouse gas emissions, making strategic decisions to lower emis­
sions, and reporting results to consumers and partners. Unfortunately, 
you must purchase the report to read it (http://cscmp.org/
resources/ioma.asp).
	
✓	Acceleration of ECO-Operation: A Milestone Study on Achieving Supply 
Chain Success and Sustainability (www.eco-opscenter.com/report.
php) offers a comprehensive study of how companies are meeting sus­
tainability goals. The downloadable report provides interesting statis­
tics that indicate the sustainability message is getting out there, but the 
follow-through isn’t quite meeting the mark.
A trend that is gaining more attention as the focus turns to environmental 
impact is reverse logistics, which refers to all post-sale logistics, from the 
support call center and field service to refurbishing, recycling, and reusing 
materials in a product at the end of its life cycle. According to the Reverse 
Logistics Association, this concept is also referred to as aftermarket logistics, 
retrogistics, and aftermarket supply chain.

Rating
This is an established industry that has begun the greening process.
Future trends (and caveats)
Several key elements must be in place to assist companies, and specifically 
supply chain managers, in putting sustainability goals into action:
	
✓	Cooperation among the myriad of supply chain managers, vendors, and 
intermediaries must be a central feature of a truly sustainable supply 
chain operation. By sharing demand and supply data more openly and 
collaborating to create best practices, the industry moves closer to 
becoming more efficient and more sustainable. 
	
✓	Accurate, verifiable, transparent data about the environmental impact of 
all parts of the supply chain regarding one’s own company’s actions as 
well as those of vendors, suppliers, and customers are essential in this 
industry. If supply chain managers can’t obtain data to determine which 
product or transportation method is more environmentally sound, they 
can’t make decisions with any reliability. 
A couple of verification systems are in the works. Walmart is gathering life 
cycle sustainability information from all its suppliers on every product it 
sells. Its goal in working with the Sustainability Consortium on this proj­
ect includes encouraging buyers and suppliers to be more innovative and 
accountable about their products’ sustainability, to help Walmart select 
the most environmentally preferred products and to enable it to track its 
own performance in regard to its supply chain. For more on this project, 
read www.greenbiz.com/blog/2009/07/14/inside-wal-marts-
sustainability-index and review the consortium’s Web site: www.
sustainabilityconsortium.org.
A number of debates are in progress as to the most effective way to reduce 
the costs and emissions of transporting goods. Here are a couple ideas :
	
✓	Reworking packaging: Although reducing bulky packaging is important, 
it’s not the only issue at play here. Supply chain managers are discover­
ing the benefits of creating packages with dimensions that allow more 
products to fit onto a pallet or on a truck. More products per run means 
more cost-effective transit, fewer deliveries, less room required to store 
the supply, and less time to load. Redesigning the traditional milk carton 
resulted in savings all the way around: www.scdigest.com/assets/
newsViews/08-07-16-1.php?cid=1801.

161
 Chapter 10: Careers in Rebuilding the Infrastructure
	
✓	Pallet transitioning: Transitioning from wooden pallets to plastic pal­
lets could remove the insect pests criss-crossing the country in wood, 
and may eliminate the need for wooden pallets — which account for 
40 percent of the hardwood harvest in the U.S. (and many pallets are 
being used exactly once!). Wood pallet waste amounts to 20 percent of 
the waste wood in landfill. Plastic pallets last 15 years, can be ground 
up and reused at the end of their life cycle, and are lighter than wood, 
but manufacturing them creates emissions. The jury is still out on which 
is better: www.scdigest.com/assets/On_Target/09-09-10-1.
php?cid=2728.
One thing is clear, logistics specialists and packaging engineers can have 
quite an impact on the emissions and costs associated with supply chain 
activities. By working this problem from both perspectives, innovations are 
likely to continue well into the future.

Transportation
The transportation sector has a huge impact on our lives and on the nation’s 
carbon footprint. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), 
transportation accounted for 28 percent of the nation’s greenhouse gas emis­
sions in 2006. The vast majority of the emissions are due to the carbon-based 
fuels used to power various forms of transportation. For more, see www.
climate.dot.gov/about/transportations-role/overview.html.
The modes of transporting freight and human passengers are varied:
	
✓	Freight, packages, materials, and fuels are transported via a network of 
airplanes, heavy trucks, ships, trains, and pipelines. 
	
✓	Specialty vehicles are used for specific purposes, such as farm equip­
ment to work the land and tend to animals, and construction vehicles to 
build structures and the overall infrastructure. 
	
✓	Public transportation systems such as subways, buses, trolleys, trains, 
and light rail are used in populated areas to move large numbers of 
people around as efficiently as possible.
	
✓	Individuals and families get around by way of automobiles and light 
trucks, recreational vehicles both on road and off road, and bicycles. 
For each element of the transportation system, people are needed to design, 
manufacture, operate, and service vehicles. But it doesn’t stop there, the 
systems upon which these vehicles run, such as highways, rail systems, sub­
ways, ports, and pipelines must also be designed, constructed, operated, and 
maintained.
Industry’s current status 
Several governmental departments are actively working to reduce the green­
house gases emitted from vehicles of all kinds:

163
 Chapter 10: Careers in Rebuilding the Infrastructure
	
✓	The EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) regulates air 
pollution from vehicles, engines, and fuels. See www.epa.gov/OMS for 
more information about this program. 
	
✓	The EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership is a collaboration with 
the freight industry to create incentives to encourage freight compa­
nies to clean up their act by increasing energy efficiency and reduc­
ing greenhouse gas emissions. For a full description, go to www.epa.
gov/smartway/transport. Through the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, the EPA provided grants and funding on 
several clean diesel programs at the national and state levels. For the 
details, see www.epa.gov/otaq/diesel/projects.htm.
	
✓	The DOE dedicated $300 million of the stimulus funds to 25 different 
Clean Cities projects intended to speed up the country’s transition to 
alternative fuel vehicles: www1.eere.energy.gov/cleancities/
projects.html.
	
✓	The DOE also invested $2.4 billion into developing electric vehicle tech­
nology, including battery technology, battery recycling systems, electric 
drive systems, test vehicles, and charging stations.
For additional government projects related to transportation, refer to this list 
of links: www.epa.gov/otaq/climate/relatedlinks.htm.
Freight companies are also moving beyond business-as-usual by updating 
their equipment in ways that improve fuel efficiency, reducing the length 
of time trucks idle, and rethinking distribution routes with the help of geo­
graphic information system GIS software than allows companies to create 
queries to evaluate different routes.
A new segment of the transportation sector is emerging to provide alterna­
tive vehicles for personal travel. These vehicles range from scooters and 
Segways to motorized bicycles and low-speed vehicles like electric golf carts. 
Rating
Transportation is a mature industry that is having to rethink and redesign to 
become sustainable/green. 
Future trends (and caveats)
The move toward alternative fuel automobiles is not stymied for lack of trying. 
Vehicles can be built to run on a number of fuel sources, including hydrogen, 
propane, natural gas, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas 

164
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
(LPG, also called autogas) biodiesel, ethanol, and others. In addition, vehicles 
can be powered by fuel cells, such as battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs), 
hybrid electrics, plug-in hybrids — even hybrid trucks: www.electricdrive.
org/index.php?ht=display/ReleaseDetails/i/13954. For all this 
innovation, there are no set standards yet. It’s possible that several technolo­
gies will evolve for different purposes. 
In May 2009 the EPA proposed a plan to increase the use of renewable energy 
as required by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The plan 
calls for developing four kinds of renewable fuels, including cellulosic biofu­
els, biomass-based diesel, advanced bio fuels, and total renewable fuel. These 
fuels would be phased in through 2022 with different production goals for 
each fuel type.
An important piece of creating viable alternative vehicles is solving the bat­
tery challenge. Lithium-ion batteries have been used to power electric cars, 
but they’re very costly. The quest for viable solutions is likely to birth a 
brand-new market segment over the next couple of decades, but there’s no 
way to know now which technologies will win the race.
Air travel is also likely to become more environmentally sound as new fuels are 
developed. Several initiatives and incentives are planned to support this effort, 
including the Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI — 
www.caafi.org) and government incentives (http://trade.gov/mas/
manufacturing/OAAI/aero_links_altfuels.asp).
Ports are another likely place for clean innovations. Traditionally, ports are 
very dirty places that use a tremendous amount of energy. A few test proj­
ects suggest that innovation can turn these numbers around. Putting a cap 
over a ship’s smokestack can control emissions for the short term until a 
more permanent solution can be invented and installed. A crane by Vycon 
Energy works like the brakes on a Prius, whereby the crane’s actions allows 
it to store the energy and use it again. For details on these ideas and others

▶	Finding methods for enforcing laws and regulations
E
ven if you don’t know how to manufacture or install a solar array, design 
a green building, or manage natural resources, you can still play a role 
in the green economy. In fact, the role you play may be critical in defining its 
future form.
Whether you are drawn to working in the financial industry, the legal field, 
planning profession, or enforcement, you have the potential to strengthen 
the green economy. By contributing your knowledge, passion, and commit­
ment, you can help companies, communities, governmental agencies, and 
financial institutions take steps to act more sustainably.
Law
Over the last few decades the United States has enacted a number of key 
pieces of legislation to protect the environment from negative human and 
industrial impacts. As this body of law has developed, it’s become layered 
and nuanced. Those in this field combine their knowledge of the law and sci­
entific concepts of conservation, sustainability, and ecology to enforce and 
enhance these laws.
Attorneys practicing in this specialty may work in environmental agencies, 
interest groups, private and public corporations, nonprofit organizations, law 
firms, and governmental agencies at the local, state, federal, and international 

168

levels. What they do during their work day is not substantially different from 
what other attorneys do.
Depending on their setting they may 
	
✓	Develop, analyze, and draft laws, regulations, briefs, contracts, and legal 
pleadings
	
✓	Settle disputes through negotiation, mediations, and litigation
	
✓	Conduct research into case law, interview, and take depositions
	
✓	Prepare licenses, permits, applications, and patents
	
✓	Monitor compliance with regulations
A section of the American Bar Association is devoted to lawyers who practice 
in this area. They divide the specialization into three main topics: 
	
✓	Environmental law addresses a wide range of environmental topics, 
from air quality and waste management to climate change and endan­
gered species. 
	
✓	Energy law grapples with an array of energy sources, from traditional 
oil and gas and hydropower to renewable energy, carbon, and restruc­
turing the electric grid. 
	
✓	Natural resources law focuses on issues associated with the Earth’s 
resources, such as water, forests, marine areas, and public lands. 
Because the energy and natural resources areas overlap, they are often com­
bined in discussions of the field. For a more detailed outline of these disci­
plines, visit www.abanet.org/environ/committees.
Industry’s current status 
A number of the laws that have governed the environment — including the 
Endangered Species Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Superfund — 
were enacted in the 1970s and 1980s. Now, with the ObamaAdministration in 
place, more legislation that impacts the environment and the energy industry 
is likely to be enacted at the federal, state, and local levels. 
As businesses, developers, local agencies, venture capitalists, and other 
entities face these new laws, they are going to need guidance to understand 
what’s expected of them and to work through any legal issues that arise. 
Legal experts expect growth in the field throughout the country, in private 
practice, nonprofit agencies, businesses, and government agencies. 

169
 Chapter 11: Working to Shape the Green Economy
Rating
All three areas of law that touch on environmental/energy issues are growing. 
This trend is not likely to slow down any time soon. 
Future trends (and caveats) 
The growing interest in new energy sources is expanding the field of energy 
law. Originally this specialization worked on issues within the oil and gas 
industry, but now new opportunities are opening up as the energy industry 
explodes. The issues that someone in this specialty might address include 
new energy generation, transmission, and storage technologies and new 
logistics regarding where and how energy is generated, delivered, and sold. 
Developments in the green economy will lead to new specialties in the legal field. 
	
✓	Carbon trading is a topic that sits on the horizon as we await new leg­
islation to define how this system will work. As more details are known, 
attorneys will undoubtedly discover that their services are in demand.
	
✓	Modernizing the electric grid and transmission system is bound to 
raise issues about property rights, partnerships, security, and other 
issues we have yet to define. 
	
✓	Cleantech law is another specialty that is poised to grow. At one level, 
this specialty focuses on traditional legal activities associated with 
patent law, intellectual property, and licensing. The cutting edge aspect 
of this specialty is the challenge of guiding cleantech inventions from 
concept to commercial venture. Given that the cleantech segment is 
emerging in a number of different directions, everything about this legal 
specialization is likely to be evolving for some time. (For more details 
about cleantech, see Chapter 10.)

Environmental justice
Although many special interest groups focus 
on particular segments of the environment, we 
must also remember that human lives are nega­
tively impacted by practices that harm the envi­
ronment. In the 1980s those involved in social 
justice and civil rights joined with environmen­
talists to raise awareness about the fact that 
disadvantaged communities are often exposed 
to more than their fair share of toxins, hazard­
ous waste, and pollution — and suffer with a 
higher incidence of health problems as a result. 
If you’ve seen Erin Brockovich, you’ve seen a 
dramatization of a real-life instance of environ­
mental justice. In that movie, the lead charac­
ter investigates a cluster of health problems 
in a rural California community. Through her 
research she discovers that the residents 
were being exposed to a toxic chemical that 
had leaked into the groundwater from a nearby 
electric plant. As the result of her research, 
a lawsuit is filed, and the company ends up 
paying a very large sum of money to the resi­
dents of the area.
According to the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA), “Environmental justice is the 
fair treatment and meaningful involvement of 
all people regardless of race, color, national 
origin, or income with respect to the develop­
ment, implementation, and enforcement of envi­
ronmental laws, regulations, and policies.”
In 1994 President Clinton signed an executive 
order to form an interagency working group to 
ensure that environmental justice was incorpo­
rated into all environmental programs through­
out the country. The working group is led by the 
EPA and includes 11 government departments 
and White House offices. For a visual repre­
sentation of this collaboration take a look at 
http://cfpub.epa.gov/compliance
/newsroom.
A wide variety of environmental justice organi­
zations exist at the international, national, state, 
regional, and city levels. These organizations 
may be governmental agencies, nonprofits, or 
academic departments.

Planning
After World War II, most urban areas shifted from a tight neighborhood plan 
to suburban sprawl. Land availability, population growth, and abundant 
natural resources allowed for unchecked development in many regions. As 
a result of this planning philosophy, planners have been focused on issues 
associated with growth such as housing needs, traffic patterns, and parking 
issues. At the same time, some rural areas and inner city neighborhoods have 
been shrinking. The economic base these communities depended on may 
have disappeared or moved away. Planners for these areas focus on revital­
ization strategies. 
No matter what the planning challenge, planners in rural areas, small towns, 
cities, counties, regions, and federal lands have the complex task of figuring 
out how to use the land and resources effectively for a number of interrelated 
purposes:
	
✓	Establishing an economic base for the community
	
✓	Incorporating the needs of the surrounding environment and wildlife
	
✓	Managing natural resources in the region and establishing local utilities
	
✓	Establishing reliable energy sources locally
	
✓	Transporting people, raw materials, finished goods, and waste
	
✓	Housing residents, businesses, and institutions
	
✓	Integrating technology needs into the plan
	
✓	Engaging residents in recreational activities
	
✓	Ensuring that all members of the community thrive 
	
✓	Preserving the ambience and enhance the quality of life of the region

Industry’s current status 
More cities and towns are realizing that constant growth has its limits. 
With nearly 1,000 mayors signing on to the U.S. Mayors’ Climate Protection 
Agreement (see map at http://usmayors.org/climateprotection/
ClimateChange.asp), cities are now focused on how to reduce greenhouse 
gases in their regions to comply with the Kyoto Protocol. 
Planning a sustainable community from scratch is one thing. It takes a lot of 
coordination, forethought, and investment. Transforming a traditional com­
munity into one that is sustainable carries with it even more challenges as 
various systems of the community must be reworked to be sustainable. 
Several planning and design philosophies — Smart Growth, New Urbanism, 
and transit-oriented development (TOD) — have gained popularity in the U.S. 
over the last three decades. Although born from different traditions, each 
of these philosophies gives planners new tools and strategies to move away 
from the idea of suburban sprawl that requires a significant amount of auto­
mobile travel. Now planners are looking toward empty or underused sites 
within city limits to create compact mixed-use developments that encourage 
walking and bicycling. According to New Urban News, 500 communities have 
been built within the New Urbanism philosophy (www.newurbannews.com/
aboutnewurbanism.html).
In June 2009 the EPA, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD), and the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) created an Interagency 
Partnership for Sustainable Communities (www.epa.gov/smartgrowth) 
to help local communities grown in a sustainable way. The stated goal of this 
partnership is to “coordinate federal housing, transportation, and other infra­
structure investments to protect the environment, promote equitable devel­
opment, and help to address the challenges of climate change.”
The New Urban News reports how money from the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act impacts sustainable transportation options in urban areas 
(www.newurbannews.com/14.2/mar09fedstimulus.html).
Rating
The industry is mature, with a developing focus on sustainable design.
Future trends (and caveats) 
The push toward Smart Growth and New Urbanism that brings neighbor­
hoods together in ways that reduce greenhouse gas emissions will continue. 

173
 Chapter 11: Working to Shape the Green Economy
Another component of Smart Growth is ensuring that communities have suf­
ficient water resources to be sustainable. Designing cities to align with the 
carrying capacity of the local watershed significantly reduces the amount 
of energy and money that is required to transport water long distances for 
drinking water, crops, and industrial uses. 
Reworking transportation options is going to play a major role in redesigning 
neighborhoods and cities. (See Chapter 13 for more information.)
Green building is going to play a big role in redesigning urban spaces. 
The Congress for the New Urbanism (CNU) has partnered with the U.S. 
Green Building Council (USGBC) and the Natural Resource Defense Council 
(NRDC) to create a set of standards for green neighborhoods called LEED 
for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND). For more information about this 
rating system, check out www.cnu.org/node/124.
As more renewable energy sources are sited locally, each community will 
need to adjust its long-term land use plan to accommodate new technologies, 
transmission systems, and distribution hubs. Open space areas are likely to 
be targeted by utilities and developers for such projects. Finding the right 
balance for renewable energy sources, wildlife, and community members will 
require negotiation, knowledge, and finesse.

Greening of the financial industry
As noted in Chapter 2, money is a key factor 
shaping the green economy. Venture capital 
and funds from the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009 are allowing emerg­
ing companies and industries to gain traction 
as they research, introduce, and sell their green 
technologies and services. Without this fund­
ing, the green economy wouldn’t be developing 
as fast as it is. 
Looking at the larger financial industry, how­
ever, signs of support for the green economy 
are still a bit weak. Although research indicates 
a number of green financial vehicles have been 
offered since the 1990s, the financial industry as 
a whole has not jumped on the trend. Although 
there are stellar examples of companies in each 
of the following categories, professional associ­
ations or industry associations have not formed 
yet to support green financial institutions. 
	✓	Banking: Green banks are offering an array 
of services to help people purchase green 
cars, make energy efficiency retrofits, add 
solar, purchase green homes, or use credit 
cards that donate a percentage of charges 
to carbon offset projects. 
	✓	Personal investment: Over the last few 
decades, socially responsible investment 
firms have been growing. Now, with the 
growing emphasis on ventures that are 
environmentally sound, a new segment of 
the investment world, sustainable invest­
ing, is also gaining strength.
	✓	Financial analysis: Investment companies 
are developing means to evaluate and 
compare companies’ performance when 
it comes to sustainability, environmental, 
social, and corporate governance (ESG), 
and social responsibility. 
	✓	Micro loans: Piggybacking on the socially 
responsible micro loan trend, groups are 
beginning to fund green micro financing 
ventures, such as www.greenmicro
finance.org, to help low-income com­
munities around the world gain access to 
clean, renewable energy.
One sign of a concerted effort to transform 
the financial industry is the United Nations 
Environment Programme Finance Initiative 
(UNEP FI), which is a partnership between 
the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP) and the financial sector worldwide. 
The purpose of this organization is to discover 
how the financial sector can invest in sustain­
able solutions that benefit the environment and 
social causes while creating solid financial 
results. Their Green Economy Initiative, also 
called the Green New Deal, was launched in 
October 2008. Since that time, they’ve pub­
lished several reports that are worth reviewing 
at www.unepfi.org.

Politics and Policy
The people we elect and the legislation and policies they enact have a 
significant impact on the shape of the green economy, the pacing of its 
development, and the industries that are likely to flourish. The people and 
organizations that influence voters and those in government are diverse and 
play a number of roles in the process. 
	
✓	Researching and analyzing issues provides in-depth information to gov­
ernment officials, industry leaders, environmental specialists, journal­
ists, and others. Accurate knowledge becomes a critical component in 
campaigns, elections, policymaking, and advocacy. 
	
✓	Influencing the public, politicians, and members of the government 
to act on a particular issue, cause, legislation, or agency rule, requires 
determination and action. Depending on the organization, the purpose, 
and the target, influencers may use education, activism, advocacy, and 
lobbying to get their point across.
	
✓	Campaigning is a complex process to influence voters to elect a particu­
lar candidate or pass an initiative. A variety of tactics are used to inform 
and persuade the public to exercise their right to vote. 

176
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
	
✓	Policymaking is the process of developing legislation and regulations 
that guide appropriate actions. The entire multi-step process is collab­
orative in that many constituents, from voters to interests groups, have 
the right to influence what ends up in a particular piece of legislation. 
To find out more about this process, read www.waterencyclopedia.
com/Oc-Po/Policy-Making-Process.html.
Industry’s current status 
To get a sense of the influence of the political arena, take a look at the follow­
ing statistics gathered from experts in the field. The American Association 
of Political Consultants (www.theaapc.org) reports that more than 50,000 
elections occur each year in the United States, not including elections for 
local and state initiatives. According to Lobbists.info (http://lobbyists.
info) there are over 22,000 lobbyists and 2,500 lobbying firms in the United 
States. These lobbyists work with 12,000 client organizations to influence the 
bills and votes of 535 Congress members. 
The day after his inauguration, President Obama announced new lobbying 
limits in an effort to make government actions more transparent. Several 
of the restrictions are meant to limit the revolving door that often exists 
between special interests groups and government officials. In late March 
2009 additional limits were placed on lobbyist communications with admin­
istration officials regarding the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act 
funding decisions. For more on these topics see www.washingtonpost.
com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/21/AR2009012103472.html, 
www.alldc.org, and www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/memoranda_
fy2009/m09-24.pdf.
The Center for Responsive Politics has studied how money influences poli­
tics since 1996. In addition to tracking donations to political campaigns, 
the organization has an in-depth database about lobbyists. A quick look at 
www.opensecrets.org/lobbyists illustrates that spending on lobbying 
ramped up dramatically between 1998 and 2008. As of this writing, the spend­
ing on lobbying and the number of lobbyists in 2009 appeared to be drop­
ping, but to be sure, check the final 2009 numbers. This organization also 
tracks the work history of members of Congress and lobbyists to highlight 
any revolving door activity. Use the search function on www.opensecrets.

The process of creating and influencing policies is mature.

 Chapter 11: Working to Shape the Green Economy
Future trends (and caveats) 
The move against corruption and toward transparency in government is 
likely to continue. Many, including the American League of Lobbyists, are 
calling for reforms in the lobbying process. The key is ethics. What’s the 
most ethical way to influence the legislative process? When new ethical stan­
dards are put in place, the next challenge will be enforcing the rules. 
At a 2008 conference of the American Association of Political Consultants, 
political consultants completed a poll about the recent campaign season and 
campaigning practices in ten years. The poll results show a dramatic shift 
from direct mail and television advertising to Web-based campaign communi­
cations, using e-mails, online videos, social networking, and blogging. Those 
polled expected to see evidence of this shift as early as the 2010 elections.

Regulation, Compliance, 
and Enforcement
After a legislative bill is signed by the President, the law spells out what’s 
expected in a certain circumstance. Agencies within the executive branch 
of government or public authority must then develop regulations that help 
the country reach the goal spelled out in the law. Within the environmental 
realm, these regulations may cover pollution, water quality, air quality, toxic 
waste, or other issues. 
	
✓	Rulemaking: When agencies develop regulations, they embark on a 
multi-step process called rulemaking to come up with the specific stan­
dards that industries and businesses must adhere to. Often during the 
process they rely on scientific and industry experts to provide the nec­
essary details to make the original law workable. The rulemaking pro­
cess is structured to ensure transparency. For an outline of the process, 
see www.epa.gov/lawsregs/brochure/developing.html.
	
✓	Compliance: As soon as the regulation is in place, the next step is to 
take actions to ensure that industries and businesses comply with the 
law. Several tactics are used to make this process as efficient and as 
effective as possible. 
 
• Compliance assistance uses workshops and training materials to 
educate the companies about the regulations and requirements.
 
• Compliance monitoring entails inspections to help companies 
understand where they are in compliance and where they need to 
enhance their processes and standards.
 
• Compliance incentives and auditing provide companies with the 
option of self-disclosing the problems they know about. Often the 
regulatory agency sets up an incentive program to encourage com­
panies to fess up.

179
 Chapter 11: Working to Shape the Green Economy
	
✓	Enforcement: When violations are discovered during compliance, 
authorities must act to enforce the law. The appropriate action depends 
on the situation. The follow-up may trigger a civil or criminal enforce­
ment process. In other cases, as in a toxic spill or release, the focus will 
be on cleaning up the environment first and foremost. Penalties of vary­
ing severity are levied as necessary. 
Industry’s current status 
Regulations.gov provides online tracking of the entire rulemaking process 
for all regulations issued by the 300 federal agencies within the U.S. govern­
ment. In total they issue an amazing 8,000 regulations a year! The EPA is by 
far the most prolific rulemaking agency. To get a sense of the vast number of

For more on the regulatory process at the EPA, visit www.epa.gov/lawsregs.
In 1970 the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) started a new era of 
transparency and collaboration between communities and federal agencies. 
All federal agencies were required to examine the impact of their proposals 
on the environment and prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). To 
gain a better understanding of this process, see www.epa.gov/compliance/
basics/nepa.html.
When possible, the EPA looks for nonregulatory ways to achieve the goals 
of the laws they are required to uphold. The EPA can sometimes negotiate 
a voluntary partnership, create economic programs to encourage action, or 
enhance technological solutions through support and training. 
Rating
The triad of regulation, compliance, and enforcement is mature. 
Future trends (and caveats)
The government will create and enforce regulations for the foreseeable 
future. Although the EPA isn’t the only agency that impacts the environment, 

180
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
it’s the most prolific and instrumental when it comes to protecting the envi­
ronment and hazards to health. Every five years the EPA creates a strategic 
plan. The plan with a blueprint for the EPA’s actions for 2006 through 2011 is 
available on www.epa.gov/ocfo/plan/plan.htm, and the strategic plan 
for 2009 through 2014 is expected to be released in late 2009. Take a look at 
the April 2009 update, www.epa.gov/progress. 
In the progress report, the EPA outlines plans to utilize the $7.22 billion dol­
lars it expects through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Most 
of the funds will go to water infrastructure projects and toxic cleanup proj­
ects. At the time of this writing, most states have received between 0 and 10 
percent of the funds they have been promised by the EPA. Check out this

Inspiring and Motivating More

In This Chapter

▶	Persuading people to change their ways through marketing and sales
▶	Consulting with businesses and organizations that want to be more sustainable
F
or the green economy to grow, individuals and companies must change 
their ways. Generally speaking, people and organizations are more com­
fortable with the status quo than they are in taking new actions. Therein lies 
the rub. 
Enter those who want to make it their work to motivate and persuade the 
world to act more sustainable. The process of educating and inspiring people 
and organizations to see a different, greener future is playing a critical role 
in the unfolding of the green economy. This work takes a number of different 
forms, from making sure people know how the environment really works 
to using marketing channels or the sales process to engage them in new 
behaviors.
Environmental Education
To move toward a sustainable way of life and business, all of us need to have a 
solid understanding of environmental issues and biological systems to be able 
to make sound decisions and take eco-friendly actions in own lives, with politi­
cal issues, and in our business activities. Environmental educators — working 
in a variety of settings, from formal educational institutions at all levels to gov­
ernment agencies, corporations, and environmental organizations — strive to 
develop environmental literacy or eco-literacy in people of all ages. 

182
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
Environmental educators don’t push a particular solution or strategy. 
Instead, they focus on raising people’s awareness of the environment, fur­
thering their understanding of how nature functions, and increasing their 
ability to think through the issues involved in various environmental issues 
and the solutions and strategies put forth to resolve them. 
The Tbilisi Declaration, created during the first intergovernmental confer­
ence on environmental education and convened by the United Nations 
Education, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in cooperation 
with the U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1978, provides the most 
commonly referenced definition of environmental education. You can read 
the definition and a detailed description of common environmental education 
settings on this Web page: www.caee.org/CEEMP/ceempfundee.html.
Industry’s current status 
When the National Environmental Education Act (NEEA) passed in 1990, the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created the Office of Environmental 
Education to increase environmental education through training programs, 
educational materials, grants, and awards. This program to provide environ­
mental educators around the country with accurate, well-designed materials 
and information to share with their students is alive and thriving within the 
EPA. To gain more insights about this work, read the short version of the origi­
nal bill at www.epa.gov/enviroed/whatis.html, visit the EPA Teaching 
Center at www.epa.gov/teachers, and check out the EPA Environmental 
Education Resources: www.epa.gov/enviroed/resources.html. 
Another facet of the NEEA was the founding of the National Environmental 
Education Foundation (NEEF), a nonprofit organization that functions indepen­
dently from the government as a liaison between various levels of government, 
businesses, education institutions, and environmental organizations. Currently 
NEEF focuses its efforts on building public-private partnerships with organiza­
tions and professions that interact with the public on environmental topics on a 
daily basis, such as weather forecasters, land managers, and health profession­
als. By engaging these professions and providing them with well-researched, 
easy-to-share information, the organization is leveraging these moments when 
the public is already thinking about the environment. For details about the pro­
grams, check out this Web page: www.neefusa.org/programs.
The NEEF conducted an annual survey of environmental knowledge from 
1995 until 2005. According to the report, available at www.neefusa.org/
resources/publications.htm#neetfpubs, the general public is not 
well informed, and at times is misinformed, about environmental issues that 
impact policy, elections, and local decisions. That’s the bad news. The good 
news is that the public is overwhelmingly interested in and supportive of 
environmental education. Results indicate that better education could “guide 
the public to simple actions that could save at least $75 billion annually.”

The industry is mature and thriving. As environmental topics take center stage 
the need for environmental education becomes more evident and essential.
Future trends (and caveats)
Environmental educators are being called upon to provide educational pro­
grams in a variety of settings on a wide range of topics. Although they’re 
trained and committed to providing quality education, they don’t always 
know how impactful their programs actually are. Although conducting in-
depth evaluations is the next logical step, many educators don’t have the 
training or resources to conduct these evaluations themselves. The School 
of Education and Natural Resources and Environment Department at the 
University of Michigan partnered with the EPA and the Forest Service to 
spearhead the development of MEERA — My Environmental Education 
Resource Assistant (http://meera.snre.umich.edu). With this resource, 
more environmental educators have the tools they need to evaluate their 
own programs and review examples. 
A recent study by the NEEF points to a new environmental education trend 
in businesses. As companies and organizations commit to sustainability and 
environmental initiatives, they are relying less on environmental specialists 
and more on the employees on the front lines. To engage their employees 
and ensure that they have adequate knowledge to contribute to changes in 
the workplace, they’re turning to environmental education. You can read the 
executive summary or full report at www.neefusa.org/business/index.

Marketing
As a new green product or service makes its way to market, the marketing 
team must work out the best way to brand, package, describe, display, and 
advertise it. The key ingredient to the marketing in this scenario is describ­
ing to potential customers how green the product or service really is. This 
marketing conversation with the customer may include a description of how 
the product was produced, where the raw materials came from, how it was 
packaged and distributed, what can be done with the product at the end of 
its life, and how energy efficient it is. The green story is about far more than 
the green features; it’s a description of the entire life cycle of the product. 
If the company has a corporate social responsibility initiative, the marketing 
story may also include a description of the social impact of the product on 
the communities of the suppliers, producers, and end users. GenGreenLife 
refers to this expanded form of marketing as sustainable green marketing. 
See www.gengreenlife.com/environment_101.php?topic=17.
Industry’s current status 
Green marketing, also known as environmental or ecological marketing, 
has been evolving since the early 1980s with Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream and 
the publication of Green Marketing by Jacquelyn Ottman (2004, BookSurge 
Publishing). More recently the push toward sustainable green products has 
raised the stakes on green marketing. Grabbing and keeping the customer’s 
attention and purchasing dollar has led some companies to stretch the truth or 
downright lie about the green characteristics of their products and services. 
This so-called green-washing by some has put all green marketers under pres­
sure to represent their products and services ethically and honestly. Even

marking tool (www.the-dma.org/Green15/OverviewDMAGreen15.pdf).
In addition, the organization has created a certificate in eco-responsible market­
ing with a detailed list of courses at www.the-dma.org/cgi/disppress­
release?article=1238. It has committed to “reducing 1 million metric tons 
of carbon emissions between 2009 and 2013 through smart list and data man­
agement, and resulting direct mail marketing activity.”

Green marketing is a developing industry that is experiencing some growing 
pains as green companies compete for customers.
Future trends (and caveats)
One of the biggest challenges facing this industry is the fact that no one is 
quite sure what constitutes a green product. With no agreed-upon standards, 
companies are left to their own devices to evaluate their products and deter­
mine the best way to communicate their green features. Although some are 
doing a better job than others, experts are searching for and debating a 
number of ways to create a consistent standard that is understood by busi­
nesses, the government, and consumers:
	
✓	The Federal Trade Commission has guidelines for those making environ­
mental claims about their products, packaging, and services. The guide­
lines (www.ftc.gov/bcp/grnrule/guides980427.htm) include 
a number of case studies that illustrate and apply the guidelines to 
common terms, including biodegradable, compostable, and recyclable.

✓	The Global Ecolabelling Network (www.globalecolabelling.net) 
recommends a labeling system to assess the life cycle impact of a prod­
uct or service by using rigorous, scientific standards established by an 
objective third party. Green Seal, www.greenseal.org, and EcoLogo 
Program, www.terrachoice-certified.com, are examples of pro­
grams that work with companies to ensure that their products and ser­
vices pass muster. 
	
✓	Others, such as GreenBlue (www.greenblue.org), believe that eco­
labeling must be accompanied by transparency in reporting exactly 
how the product or service impacts the environment. In a post on 
this topic, www.greenbiz.com/engage/blog/2009/07/30/real-
opportunity-radical-transparency-b2b, Jason Pearson, CEO of 
GreenBlue, explains his view. 
One of the issues influencing the direct mail industry is the challenge of 
reducing its use of paper made from wood pulp. Although recycled paper is 
one option, some companies are looking to alternative kinds of paper. Tree 
Free Paper (www.treefreepaper.com) describes four different ways to 
make paper from non-wood sources such as agricultural waste, crops, fabric 
sources, and plants found in the wild. If you really want to go out on a limb, 
imagine paper made of stone. Although it may seem impossible, Deliver mag­
azine reports that Johnson Paper LP supplies stone paper: www.deliver

Green sales?
Every company with a product or service needs 
a sales team. Any consulting firm or business 
is going to need a sales team to do business 
development. Yet the sales profession doesn’t 
appear to be offering training on how to become 
a better green salesperson or guidance about 
how to find these positions.
One sales position that has gotten a lot of media 
attention is solar sales. Training programs for 
solar salespeople are beginning to surface. 
Rich Hessler Solar Sales Training (www.
pvsolarsalestraining.com) and The 
Art of Selling Solar (www.4solarsales.
com) are examples of such training programs.
You may also be able to find independent sales 
positions with companies that provide green 
cleaning products and beauty supplies. But 
that’s really just the tip of the proverbial ice­
berg. Every company is going to need a sales 
team when they are ready to sell. Although 
companies in the early stage of development 
may not have a product ready for market, you 
may be able to identify business-to-business 
sales positions as these emerging companies 
ramp up their production. 
Solar sales and personal products aren’t the 
only career options for those in sales. The key 
to finding a good sales position is to track indus­
tries that are a good fit for your previous sales 
experience and your passions. If you sold highly 
technical equipment before, look for a green 
company with a similar kind of equipment and 
a comparable sales cycle. If you sold building 
supplies, transition into green building supplies 
that leverages off your knowledge of the build­
ing industry. 
To succeed, you must know how to sell and 
know about your target industry. If you don’t 
yet know much about the target industry, take 
courses, attend conferences, and soak up as 
much information as you can. If you haven’t 
done sales before, but have a strong back­
ground in a particular industry, take some sales 
training courses to build your expertise on the 
sales process. When you find an industry that 
looks promising, track its progress and be ready 
to join the team when someone is ready to hire 
a sales team. If it looks like you’ll be waiting a 
while, get known in the industry, find work in a 
related field that will give you leverage within 
this industry, and get the training you need to 
be a sales star.

Sustainability Specialists
The move from business as usual to sustainable business is underway. 
Although the specifics of the transition may differ depending on the actual 
focus of the organization, the process and approach remain fairly consistent, 
including the following components:
	
✓	Assessing an organization’s social and environmental impact may 
include measuring the organization’s carbon footprint and the extent 
to which the company impacts its community. With the shortcomings 
in mind, the next step is to create a multi-faceted action plan to reduce 
emissions and minimize the impact on the community. After implement­
ing the plan, monitoring the results allows the organization to continue 
to refine its actions to meet overall goals for sustainability.
	
✓	Training and educating those involved in the process of evaluating cur­
rent systems and finding more energy- and resource-efficient ways to 
perform the tasks of the organization are essential for employee engage­
ment and participation.
	
✓	Communicating the impact and progress through a sustainability report 
allows various stakeholders to understand the organization’s green 
efforts. Incorporating the initiatives and actions into the marketing plan 
and public relations is also key.
Industry’s current status 
As companies assess their impact on the environment and community, 
they must decide who will actually implement the initiatives associated 
with improving their sustainability status. Some organizations hire a 
consultant who provides the facilitation and structure to help the organiza­
tion determine where they stand on a variety of environmental criteria.

 Chapter 12: Inspiring and Motivating More Sustainable Actions 
Green media
The media has covered the environmental move­
ment since its earliest phase in the 1960s and 
1970s. In fact, the field of environmental journal­
ism developed to report on and translate what 
was happening in the environment for the public. 
An ongoing debate within the environmental 
journalism field is whether journalists should 
stick to reporting current events objectively or 
take an advocacy role for the environmental­
ism point of view. For an overview of the media 
impact on the green movement, check out www.
crinfo.org/booksummary/10380. 
Writers interested in the environment may 
also want to consider science writing, envi­
ronmental interpretation, environmental advo­
cacy, and green marketing as outlets for their 
talents. For a description of these genres, visit 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Environmental_journalism.
Although the news media has played an influen­
tial role in the environmental movement and the 
green economy, the industry itself isn’t particu­
larly green, though there are some early signs 
that the industry is moving in that direction:
	✓	These days many media sources report 
on the green economy and environmental 
news, but often it’s by a reporter who’s 
been assigned to the green beat rather 
than a trained environmental journalist. 
The Society of Environmental Journalists 
strongly believes that the quality, accuracy, 
and depth of reporting on environmental 
issues must be enhanced.
	✓	Well-known media sources such as The 
New York Times, The Washington Post, 
The Los Angeles Times, and The Wall 
Street Journal have blogs covering green 
economy issues. 
	✓	Sources dedicated solely to green topics are 
found in several new media outlets: From 
cable television (Planet Green, including 
Focus Earth with Bob Woodruff, http://
planetgreen.discovery.com) to 
online video (Green.tv), to an ever-
growing array of blogs written by online 
journalists, industry experts, and individu­
als committed to the cause. See the book’s 
online Cheat Sheet (www.dummies.com/
cheatsheet/greencareers) for a list 
of green blogs. 
	✓	The National Association of Broadcasters 
partnered with the EPA to create a booklet 
for broadcasters to disseminate relevant 
green facts, public service announcements, 
and ways to green their workplace: www.
nhab.org/member_resources/
goinggreen.html.
	✓	A sustainability consulting firm called Reel 
Green Media (www.reelgreenmedia.
com) helps the entertainment industry, from 
production companies to theaters, green up 
their act. They take a look at everything from 
the food on the set to opening night events. 
	✓	In 2008 the Digital Entertainment Group 
released a study of the home entertainment 
supply chain from home entertainment 
studios to retailers. Findings indicate that 
there are ways to build more efficiencies 
into the process of producing DVDs and 
getting them into the hands of customers:

Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
In some cases organizations hire from within, finding a current employee 
who is interested in efficiency and environmental issues or who has line 
experience in a key area of the organization. This individual’s title may 
range from sustainability manager to chief sustainability officer (CSO). The 
field is so young that the role of the CSO often varies across organizations 
as different companies figure out the best way to address their impact on 
the environment. 
Sustainability is also influencing other sectors of our economy besides big 
business. Several nonprofit associations have been working toward sus­
tainability for many years, such as the Association for the Advancement of 
Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE — www.aashe.org) and ICLEI-
Local Governments for Sustainability (www.icleiusa.org). Both sites offer 
a wealth of information about sustainability in general and as applied to 
their niche. Even small- and medium-sized companies are getting into the act 
with the help of sustainability consultants, such as Strategic Sustainability 
Consulting: www.sustainabilityconsulting.com/about.
Companies worldwide are making the extra effort to report on their envi­
ronmental performance based on a widely used reporting system devel­
oped by the Global Reporting Initiative: www.globalreporting.org/
ReportingFramework/ReportingFrameworkOverview. As more com­
panies adopt this standardized reporting framework, companies are able to 
assess their improvement over time and compare their efforts with those of 
other companies. 
Rating
The industry is emerging as more and more organizations transition to sus­
tainable business practices. 
Future trends (and caveats)
Although you’ve probably heard of sustainability initiatives in manufactur­
ing, local municipalities, and retail stores, you may not have thought of sus­
tainability efforts in the entertainment field (see the earlier sidebar, “Green 
media,” for more on this topic), the medical field (www.practicegreen
health.org and www.gghc.org/about.cfm), and your local brewery 
(www.greengrog.com/west-coast-dominates-green-brewing). 
Nearly every industry out there is exploring sustainability to some degree. 
Just because you (or I) haven’t heard of it yet doesn’t mean it isn’t happen­
ing. Use your favorite search engine to discover how your target industry is 
going green. Enter “your target industry” + green to see what you find.

 Chapter 12: Inspiring and Motivating More Sustainable Actions 
In March 2009 the Global Reporting Initiative released the Amsterdam 
Declaration of Transparency and Reporting, asking all governments to imple­
ment a policy that requires companies, public organizations, and the global 
financial regulatory body to complete an annual sustainability report, www.
globalreporting.org/CurrentPriorities/AmsterdamDeclaration. 
Their assessment is that voluntary compliance is not enough. Transparency 
and the full costs of environmental and social impacts must be taken into 
account for the global economy to regain momentum.

Providing Green Products 
and Services
In This Chapter
▶	Finding innovative ways to help people see the world while saving the planet
▶	Exploring several ways you can provide guests with a green experience
▶	Applying natural products to everything from cleaning to personal care
▶	Bringing green know-how to the housing market
A
lthough much of the green economy focuses on large scale changes to 
our world such as transitioning to new energy sources, revamping the 
transportation infrastructure, and creating new laws and policies to regulate 
said changes, the green economy also touches our lives at a much more per­
sonal level.
This chapter explores the green products and sustainable experiences that 
bring the green reality up close and personal. Whether you want to have a 
role in creating natural products, planning exciting travel experiences, man­
aging large-scale events or helping people with their real estate transactions, 
there are plenty of opportunities to make your mark.
Ecotourism
Traveling the world to see and experience the sights and sounds draws 
people to natural spots, from beaches and mountains to jungles and mead­
ows. Unfortunately, mass-market tourism has a detrimental impact on the 
very environments that draw tourists to travel. The ecotourism industry has 
evolved over the past 20 years to allow people to travel to nature destina­
tions more responsibly. According to the Mohonk Agreement of 2000 (www.
rainforest-alliance.org/tourism.cfm?id=mohonk), ecotourism is 
“tourism that seeks to minimize ecological and sociocultural impacts while 
providing economic benefits to local communities and host countries.” 

194
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) (www.ecotourism.org) 
describes ecotourism as being built on the principles of minimizing the 
impact of travelers on the environment, increasing peoples’ awareness of 
both the environment and the local culture, creating positive experiences for 
both travelers and the locals, finding innovative ways to make conservation 
and local involvement financially beneficial, and raising awareness of the 
local areas’ political and social realities. 
The ecotourism industry consists of three main functions:
	
✓	Assessing and developing sustainable tourism destinations
	
✓	Managing ecotourism destinations sustainably
	
✓	Marketing the destination
	
For more information about these functions and related topics, check out the 
online courses listed on www.ecotourism.org under Learning Center. 
Industry’s current status 
According to the Rainforest Alliance (www.rainforest-alliance.org), 
the travel industry helps more than 900 million people travel each year. In 
addition to being one of the largest sources of income and employment for 
many developing countries, the travel industry can have a detrimental effect 
on local environments if not managed properly.
Although ecotourism has only amounted to 3 or 4 percent of the travel indus­
try in the past, international travel has motivated local residents in stunning 
destinations to conserve and maintain their corner of the world. The trick is 
finding the right balance between using ecotourism as a way to motivate and 
fund conservation and minimizing the carbon footprint of transporting people 
halfway around the world to visit these natural areas. For more information on 
this dilemma, read: www.guatemala-times.com/environment/946-can-
ecotourism-be-more-than-an-illusion.html.
According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 
Sustainable Consumption and Production Branch, www.unep.fr/scp/sc, 
nature tourism is growing by 10–12 percent each year. The World Tourism 
Organization also reports that nature-based tourism is the fastest-growing 
tourism sector. There are also signs that the mass-market travel segment is 
beginning to see the benefits of becoming more sustainable.
Ecotourism destinations have taken it upon themselves to become certified 
in recent years to demonstrate their efforts to become more sustainable. 
More than 60 certification programs, with a grand total of 4,500 different 

195
 Chapter 13: Providing Green Products and Services
criteria, exist worldwide. To help key stakeholders make sense of all the dif­
ferent certifications, a group of 27 travel organizations joined together as 
the Partnership for Global Sustainable Tourism Criteria (www.sustainable
tourismcriteria.org) to create a global sustainability certification standard.
Rating
The industry is maturing and reaching for new goals.
Future trends (and caveats)
The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), a group of the largest travel 
and tourism companies in the world, released a report entitled Leading the 
Challenge on Climate Change in which 40 of the largest tourism companies in 
the world committed in 2005 to reducing their carbon emissions by 50 per­
cent by 2035, with an interim milestone of a 30 percent reduction by 2020. For 
more information about this commitment and the report, visit www.wttc.
org/eng/Tourism_Initiatives/Environment_Initiative.
The next step after certification is continued monitoring. If establishments 
fail to be monitored for performance and adherence, they may well lose their 
sustainable status. Methods for monitoring must be implemented along with 
the certification process. 
Education and marketing the benefits of sustainable travel is crucial to the 
industry’s success. Countries blessed with rich biodiversity may be able to 
restore and conserve local ecosystems and habitats while also strengthening 
local economies. Tourism businesses can use ecotourism and sustainability 
to build their brand with travelers by making them aware of the benefits of 
ecotourism. One of the ways travelers can enhance their impact is to use part 
of their vacation to make a difference in the local community by working on a 
restoration, wildlife conservation, or other local improvement project. 
A new trend in ecotourism is establishing a presence on various social net­
working platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. You can help out your 
favorite ecotourism establishments by following and friending them. Share 
their updates with your friends. Who knows? You may find yourself on vaca­
tion thanks to a special deal.
For the ecotourism industry to thrive, the airline industry must strive to 
lower the carbon footprint of air travel. Several airlines are testing various 
biofuels and fuel combinations to determine which ones are most effective.

Event Planning
Conferences, trade shows, weddings, and other large gatherings are generally 
energy-consuming, waste-producing ventures. Whether planned by internal 
staff or external consultants, creating events with the lowest possible carbon 
footprint and highest possible waste diversion is the goal of green meetings. 
Each meeting is a confluence of vendors and venues. According to BlueGreen 
Meetings (www.bluegreenmeetings.org), each of the following groups 
has a role to play in greening events: 
	
✓	Convention and visitors bureaus: Professionals trying to bring large 
conventions to town must be able to demonstrate what the city and 
region are doing to become more sustainable. They may also be asked 
to recommend venues, hotels, and activities in the area that meet the 
green initiatives of the meeting planner/sponsoring organization. 
	
✓	Accommodations: Hotels have an array of actions they can take to 
reduce their impact on the environment. From guest services to hotel-
wide systems, changes can be made. For details see the “Lodging and 
restaurants” sidebar. 
	
✓	Meeting/event venues: The meeting site itself has special challenges 
and opportunities. Feeding, engaging, entertaining, and cleaning up after 
a large group for several days is intense. Special care must be taken to 
find sustainable ways to achieve each desired outcome. 
	
✓	Transportation: The vendors that provide ground and air transporta­
tion to and from the event must also be brought into the loop. By doing 
research upfront, the meeting planner can suggest the greenest alterna­
tives to the attendees. 

198
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
	
✓	Food and beverage: Sourcing, preparing, serving, and disposing of left­
overs several times a day for the duration of the meeting requires coor­
dination and creative thinking. Working with the venue’s catering staff 
can bring innovative solutions to the situation.
	
✓	Exhibition production: The exhibit hall brings its own set of challenges 
as each vendor arrives with its own handouts, giveaways, signage, and 
displays. Providing recommendations and guidelines can ensure that the 
exhibit hall activities reflect the green initiatives of the event. 
Industry’s current status 
The final set of standards of the Convention Industry Council’s Green 
Meetings and Events Practice Panel were released in late 2009. For more 
about this set of standards, read: http://meetingsnet.com/checklist
showto/green_meetings/0701-developing-meeting-standards.
On Earth Day 2009 the Green Meeting Industry Council (GMIC) launched 
the Million Tons of Trash Challenge, asking hospitality, travel, and meeting 
planning companies to divert one million tons of waste in one year. Diverted 
waste means waste that doesn’t make its way to landfill because it is reused, 
recycled, or composted (www.greenmeetings.info).
As the industry ramps up sustainable meeting practices in a tight economy, 
industry suppliers, such as hotels, caterers, florists, and the like, are highlight­
ing their sustainable and socially responsible solutions to gain business from 
meeting planners. For examples of these innovations, read http://meetings
net.com/checklistshowto/green_meetings/0701-companies-
managing-budget-cuts.
Rating
This industry is mature and taking new steps to become more sustainable. 
Future trends (and caveats)
The future holds several likely outcomes. As the field of sustainability 
evolves, the industry’s standards will be upgraded to match the new bench­
marks and technological advances. In addition, a training system will be put 
in place to bring meeting planners and suppliers up to speed on the stan­
dards released in late 2009. 

199
 Chapter 13: Providing Green Products and Services
As soon as training programs are in place, a certification process is likely to 
be implemented to verify that the standards are in fact being met by various 
venues, suppliers, and meeting planners. As this system takes hold, meeting 
planners will be able to use quantifiable results to demonstrate that they’ve 
met their corporate clients goals for sustainability and achieved a certain 
amount of cost savings as a result. In addition, suppliers will use their scores 
in their marketing materials to prove their viability to meeting planners.

Lodging and restaurants
In the hospitality industry, job titles are likely to 
be nearly identical in green and traditional prop­
erties. To find a position in this industry, focus 
your efforts on establishments that are actively 
moving toward sustainable business prac­
tices. Creating a sustainable hospitality industry 
requires reworking four segments of the industry:
	✓	Hotels: Powering, maintaining, decorating, 
cleaning, lighting, and managing waste 
all create expensive challenges for large 
chain hotels, boutique hotels, and bed 
and breakfasts. Becoming more sustain­
able allows establishments to cut costs 
significantly while minimizing their impact 
on the environment. To see what’s entailed 
in greening a hotel, see www.green
lodgingnews.com and www.ahla.
com/green.aspx?id=24560.
	✓	Restaurants: In addition to finding new food 
sources that are more organic, local, and 
sustainable, restaurants must also evaluate 
their water and energy usage. Becoming 
more efficient in their use of water and 
energy and installing renewable energy 
sources shrinks both costs and carbon 
footprints. Waste from food preparation 
and leftovers, as well as paper products, 
has quite an impact on landfills. Finding 
new solutions, such as composting and 
purchasing biodegradable containers made 
from tree-free sources, can transform this 
industry’s impact. For more details: www.

Natural Personal Care and Cleaning
Customer demand for environmentally sound products and services is fuel­
ing more natural products in the areas of personal care, beauty, health, 
dietary supplements, pet products, and cleaning. Consumers want to know 
that the products that are touching them, their babies, and their pets are 
safe, effective, and natural in their ingredients and their formulation.
As this broad industry responds to this market-driven trend, companies are 
coming up with natural products that appeal to their customer base. 
	
✓	Personal care and beauty: Everything from basic soaps and toothpastes 
to hair products, skin care, fragrances, and makeup
	
✓	Cleaning: Household and industrial cleaning products 
	
✓	Health: Supplements, treatments, remedies, and herbs
	
Often the business or individual selling such products also provides a related 
service that is marketed to be natural, organic, and sustainable. Think make-
up artists, hair salons, spas, cleaning services, and alternative health provid­
ers. In each of these scenarios, the professionals providing the service must 
rethink how they perform and advertise their services. For example, a green 
cleaning company must not only purchase the appropriate cleaning products, 
but must also have the proper equipment, tools, and knowledge to clean a 
house, commercial building, or hotel in a way that uses fewer cleaning prod­
ucts and less energy and disposes of waste properly. 
Industry’s current status 
The sale of natural products is growing by leaps and bounds. According to 
In-Cosmetics, the natural personal care market has experienced “double-digit 
growth annually” since 2003. Natural cosmetic products and those inspired 
by nature (more on that in a moment) are 6 percent of the market. 
Throughout this multi-faceted industry there is a debate, namely: How does 
the industry define the terms organic, natural, nature-inspired, and natural 
extracts? How does it educate consumers and fulfill marketing promises? How 
do consumers know that what they are buying is what they think they’re 
buying? 

202
Part III: Exploring Careers in Green Industries 
Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulates cosmetics for 
organic ingredients, it doesn’t evaluate how natural cosmetics or other personal 
care products are. In an effort to self-regulate its industry, the Natural Products 
Association has created a definition consumers can use to evaluate the per­
sonal care products they purchase: “Natural products should contain only 
ingredients that come from a renewable/plentiful source found in nature — in 
other words, flora, fauna or mineral sources. Any synthetic ingredient must only 
be used in a natural personal care product when there is no viable natural alter­
native ingredient available and only when there are absolutely no suspected 
human health risks.” Read their one-page description: www.naturalproducts
foundation.org/clientuploads/WYSKA_Natural_Personal_Care_
Products.pdf.
To support this standard, certification programs are being put into place. 
For example, the GreenSeal certifies soap and shower products and personal 
care products (www.greenseal.org/certification/environmental.
cfm#6). The Natural Products Association (NPA) bestows the Natural Seal 
on natural products (www.thenaturalseal.org), while NSF International, 
the public health and safety company, certifies organic products (www.
nsf.org/business/quality_assurance_international/index.
asp?program=OrganicFooCer). Quality Assurance International/NSF and 
NPA are agreeing to recognize each others’ certifications, allowing cosmetic 
companies to offer their products across borders more readily.
Some cosmetic companies are expanding their line to include products cre­
ated from natural ingredients harvested from environmentally vulnerable 
areas in an effort to encourage locals to nurture their natural flora and fauna. 
By setting up fair trade agreements, the company gives an economic boost to 
an area of the world that needs it. In return, the company is able add to addi­
tional value and marketing appeal to their product.
Rating
Growing in response to consumer demand for more natural products.
Future trends (and caveats)
The push in natural personal care and cleaning products is for common stan­
dards across borders and across product categories. Terms such as organic 
and natural should have standard, agreed-upon meanings for all the players, 
from consumers to retailers, marketers, distributors, manufacturers, suppli­
ers, scientists and educators. Integrating these definitions into existing certi­
fication organizations is going to be challenging at best.

Industry experts express concerns about the trend toward genetically engi­
neered products, cosmetics produced with nanotechnology, cosmeceuticals 
(cosmetics blended with drugs for topical application) and nutricosmet­
ics (products ingested orally). For more details see www.nanowerk.com/
news/newsid=1505.php and www.gcimagazine.com/marketstrends/
segments/nutricosmetics/42535102.html. Given that these prod­
ucts are relatively new and untested, it’s worrisome that the Food and Drug 
Administration has no standards in place to evaluate the efficacy of products 
in these categories.

Fair trade commerce
Fair trade is an economic partnership to create 
an international trading system that is just and 
sustainable. Fair trade organizations work 
directly with artisans and farmers to create 
an equitable exchange of goods that enables 
them to create independent businesses that 
are financially viable. Fair trade partnerships 
that work lead to positive changes that ripple 
throughout the community, including bring­
ing back nearly forgotten cultural techniques, 
conserving the biodiversity of the region, and 
creating communities that value the contribu­
tions of women. 
The Fairtrade Labelling Organizations 
International (FLO) (www.fairtrade.net) 
reviews the supply chain from point of origin 
to the point of sale to ensure that all steps in 
the process meet fair trade standards. In North 
America, the organizations that certify fair trade 
products are TransFair Canada (www.trans
fair.ca) and TransFair USA (www.trans
fairusa.org). Each organization tracks 
certain products, many of them food related. 
The bodies that evaluate organizations for their 
commitment to fair trade principles include the 
World Fair Trade Organization (www.wfto.
com) and the Fair Trade Federation (FTF) (www.
fairtradeorganization.com) for 
North America. Retailers and importers gener­
ally focus on food products, accessories, crafts, 
packaging, and gifts. Members of these orga­
nizations commit to a set of principles to make 
sure that they are selling free trade products 
that were grown or manufactured by people 
who were paid equitably.

take time to prepare yourself to be the best job can­
didate you can be. In this part you discover ways to 
explore potential green industries, build your green net­
work, and strengthen your knowledge and skills. Using 
what are called Job Search 2.0 strategies — such as social 
networking, blogging, and online portfolios — you create 
an online presence to enhance your visibility for your job 
search. As your path becomes clearer and you become 
more confident about your skills and competitive advan­
tage, you create a clear, concise statement of your unique 
contribution that captures the attention of the company 
that hires you. 

Chapter 14
Getting to Know Your 
Target Industry
In This Chapter
▶	Exploring your target green industry
▶	Gaining an overview online
▶	Reaching out to those in the field for the latest developments
T
he green economy is an ever-changing sea of opportunity. Every day 
brings new information. If you attempt to explore every green industry to 
figure out where you fit, you’ll likely be overwhelmed. The key to finding your 
green career is to focus your attention on one or two industries that intrigue 
you most. These target industries become the rudder you use to keep your­
self on track during your exploration phase. 
In this chapter you discover a number of ways to investigate your target 
industries to confirm that they are viable and a good fit for you personally 
and professionally. Although you may be tempted to launch into a series of 
informational interviews as soon as you identify your target industries, take 
some time to explore your top two industries online first. With your initial 
research, you gain a basic understanding of the field, which you can then 
build upon through conversations with people who work in the field. 
	
For now, focus your attention on gathering information about your top two 
target industries. Your goal is not to make a decision at this point, it is to 
develop an objective understanding of your targets without interjecting your 
hopes and worries into the mix. You have plenty of opportunities later on to 
decide which you want most. 
Gaining a Solid Foundation Online
The Internet offers a vast array of resources you can use to explore any and 
every topic under the sun. Use it to strengthen your understanding of your 
target industries, as well as your profession or trade. Although you may be 

208
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
tempted to click off in a number of different directions, keep your focus on 
your top two targets for now. Depending on your own personal style, you 
may want to set aside some time to investigate one field first and then do the 
other. 
As soon as you have a basic grasp of a target industry, you have a foundation 
to build on. As you begin your research, be on the lookout for resources you 
may want to come back to if you decide to pursue this target career.
Refining your keywords
	
Keywords — the terms you enter into search engines to find information — 
are your friends. By using keywords strategically you enhance your abil­
ity to gather meaningful, content-rich material about your favorite topics. 
Throughout this chapter, as you build your research toolkit, you find keyword 
combinations you can use each step of the way. 
To create a list of keywords for your industry, think about the words that are 
commonly used when discussing it. Jot down industry descriptors as you 
come across them in your research. Review the following keyword lists for a 
few green industries to grasp the kinds of terms you’re looking for. 
	
✓	Smart grid: Unified smart grid, microgeneration, co-generation, energy 
transport, energy information technology, smart appliance, emeter, 
smart meter, smart device, energy transmission 
	
✓	Solar: Solar energy, solar nonprofit, solar installer, photovoltaic, PV, 
thin-film PV, Copper indium gallium (di)selenide (CIGS), solar cells, solar 
panels, photovoltaic conversion efficiency, concentrating solar power 
(CSP), building-integrated photovoltaics
	
✓	Cleantech: Clean technology, sustainability technology, energy produc­
tivity, cleantech design, greentech
	
✓	Energy efficient: Energy-efficient design, energy efficiency policy, energy-
efficient buildings, transportation efficiency, industrial efficiency, 
energy efficiency assessors, negawatt (energy saved through efficiency), 
Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS), energy efficiency resource 
standards
	
✓	Environmental science: Environmental impact assessment (EIA), biodi­
versity, water quality, groundwater contamination, soil contamination, 
use of natural resources, waste management, sustainable development, 
disaster reduction, air pollution, noise pollution

209
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know Your Target Industry
Creating an overview of a target industry 
To make the best use of your time, begin by getting a general idea of your 
industry. Use the following keyword combinations in your favorite search 
engine to discover Web pages with straightforward descriptions of your 
target field. Just replace the word keyword(s) with the best keyword(s) for 
your target industry. And use quotation marks as I do here if your keyword 
contains more than one word. Putting quotation marks around words tells 
the engine to find pages that contain exactly that phrase, rather than pages 
that contain all three words in any order. You may need to experiment with 
keyword selections to determine which ones are most productive for you.
“keyword(s)” + “what is”
“keyword(s)” + industry
“keyword(s)” + history
“keyword(s)” + profile
	
It’s quite likely that your initial searches will bring up Wikipedia resources. 
Although Wikipedia pages are written by the public, they often provide well-
organized, easy-to-read descriptions. You always want to corroborate what 
you discover there. Think of Wikipedia as the starting point of your research, 
not the final word on a subject. 
You may also run across industry overviews on a variety of other sites. As 
you come across sites for professional associations, industry associations, 
training, and certification programs, keep track of the Web site addresses for 
future reference. Either bookmark them or paste the URLs into a document. 
Read at least three to five industry overviews, or until you notice that your 
sources are repeating the same information. You might want to open each 
overview in a new browser tab to move between the pages for easy compari­
son. Although you’re likely to find more detailed information as you continue 
your research, repetition is a good sign that you’ve gotten to the core of your 
topic. 
	
If questions come to mind as you read the overviews, jot them down. You 
may find answers later in your research. You can also use your questions to 
develop a strategy for informational interviews later in your research process.
Professional associations
Your next goal is to identify the associations that are most closely aligned 
with your target industry. Depending on your target, you may be looking for 
an industry association, a trade association, or a professional association.

210
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
If you found a profile of your target industry in Chapters 7 through 13, see if 
there’s an association Web site listed there. If you didn’t find a profile of your 
industry or if you’re interested in a specialized part of an industry, you may 
need to search some more to find the association that’s most relevant to you. 
Try the following search strategies to locate an appropriate association:
	
✓	In Wikipedia, review the content again to see if the main text, sidebars, 
or fine print at the bottom names any associations. It’s often found in 
the External Links section near the end of a page. If you find the name of 
an association, click the link or search for the association’s Web site. 
	
✓	Use a keyword(s) search: “keyword(s)” + association.
	
✓	Check out the categories on Weddle’s Association List (www.weddles.
com/associations/index.cfm).
Bookmark association Web sites. You’re likely to return there frequently. If 
you locate several associations, compare them to see which is most closely 
aligned with your career goals. While you’re on each site, sign up for newslet­
ters. If the newsletters are only available to paying members, wait until you 
know which direction you’re taking before you subscribe.
Industry-specific terminology
Another challenge when you begin to explore a new industry is getting the 
hang of the lingo and jargon. Each industry has its own terminology that you 
must understand to be successful in your investigation. 
Wikipedia articles can be a good place to start getting a feel for the terminol­
ogy of a new industry because most terms are linked to another page for that 
keyword. You may also be able to find a glossary dedicated to your indus­
try by using the keywords: “keyword” + glossary. Don’t be alarmed if your 
search brings up a glossary for students. Often these glossaries are concise 
enough that you can read them within minutes. Then you can look for more 
in-depth glossaries to further your knowledge. 
Key players to watch
Identifying the people who are very involved and instrumental in shaping 
your target field can be critically important. As soon as you recognize a 
few names, your understanding of the nuances and dynamics of the indus­
try picks up a notch. Suddenly a blog post that didn’t mean much to you 
becomes a rich source of information because you understand the players 
and their perspectives. Read and bookmark several blogs that focus on your 

211
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know Your Target Industry
industry or profession to become familiar with key players. Not sure which 
blogs cover your industry? Search these terms: “keyword” + blog.
Another powerful source of names is the Web site for your industry’s main 
conference. If you’ve found your professional associations, look to see if they 
have a link to a recent or upcoming conference. Review the names of keynote 
speakers, breakout speakers, moderators, and exhibitors. It may take a while 
to decide which names to follow closely, but you’re likely to be able to make 
some connection from this information. With time, you’ll notice patterns that 
point you toward the people to watch in your profession. If you can’t find a 
conference listed through an association, search: “keyword” + conference.
Publications to read
As you conduct your exploratory research, notice the titles of publications you 
should add to your must-read list. Most associations publish an annual report 
on the state of the industry or a description of new advancements in the field. 
Given that green industries are changing quite rapidly, these reports are often 
the most current description of trends, warnings, and future directions. 
Another source for up-to-date information on your industry is the media. 
Typically, blogs and online news sources are great ways to get updates as 
changes unfold in your field. Enter keywords in the Google News search box 
at http://news.google.com or use keywords to find news vehicles:
“keyword” + blog
“keyword” + news
“keyword” + report
Confirming That the Industry 
Is Right for You
Before you invest more time in exploring your target industries, consolidate 
what you’ve discovered thus far by considering the following questions:
	
✓	Is your target industry viable? From the reading you’ve done thus far, 
what is your sense of the industry? Are you comfortable enough with 
what you’re reading to continue the process of exploring the industry? 
	
✓	How does your target industry match your interests and skills? If 
you’ve read Chapters 4 and 5, take another look at your notes. Can you 
see your favorite skills and interests coming into play with your target 
industry? If you’re missing a skill, is it one you’d like to develop?

212
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Will this industry allow you to work the way you want to? Take 
another look at your notes from Chapter 6 to assess whether this piece 
of the puzzle is a good fit for you. 
	
✓	Given what you know about yourself and this industry, can you see 
yourself working in this field? Imagine how you would feel if you were 
working in the field. Would you feel engaged and energized? Or would 
the work environment or topic drain or overwhelm you? 
At this point, you’re primarily looking for red flags that might cause you to 
question your decision to pursue this target industry. Essentially this is a gut 
check based on your current understanding of your target industry. 
	
✓	If you feel comfortable enough with your assessment, move on to the 
next section of this chapter. You know that you have more details to dis­
cover and you’re excited about what you’ve uncovered.
	
✓	If you aren’t comfortable with what you’ve found so far, ask yourself: 
 
• Are your concerns based on assumptions you’re making about 
your target industry? If your preconceived notions about the 
industry are skewing your thinking, continue your exploration to 
determine whether your assumptions are valid or not. 
 
• Are your worries stemming from what you don’t know about your 
industry? Perhaps you wonder about pending legislation or tech­
nology developments that will make or break your industry. This 
isn’t a time to back off, this is a time to dig in to discover as much 
as you can from industry experts. 
 
• Is your discomfort based on facts you’ve uncovered while gaining 
an understanding of the overall industry? If so, you may decide to 
pass on this industry and choose a different one.
Given the fluid nature of the green economy and all the factors that must 
come together to build a thriving economy, it’s possible you’ll need to switch 
your focus at some point. You may decide that your interests are taking you 
in another direction or that the industry isn’t looking as promising as it once 
did. The key is to stay alert and nimble. Honor your sense of your direction. 
Deepening Your Understanding 
of the Industry
After verifying that you want to pursue a career in your target industry, it’s 
time to dig deeper to gain more insights into its current state and future. Your 
focus is on understanding the opportunities and threats facing your field. In 
addition, you want to know the problems your industry faces at this time. 

213
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know Your Target Industry
With this foundation of knowledge, you can now assess the career options 
within the industry to determine which job titles you want to explore. Avoid 
the temptation to latch onto a specific job title early in your research. The 
more you know about the overall industry, the better you’ll understand your 
career options within the industry. 
Recognizing industry opportunities 
and threats
Keep your eyes open for discussions of issues that may have a long-term 
impact on your career. As the green economy takes shape, a number of 
pieces are being put in place that can have a dramatic effect in the short term 
and long term. Although you may not know enough detail yet to unravel the 
full impact of new policies or the expiration of an incentive, identifying that 
these issues exist is your primary goal for now. Later, as you talk with people 
in your field, you can ask them for clarification on the issues you identify.
The best places to look for trends are the blogs, news media, industry asso­
ciations, and conferences you’ve already found. If you’ve identified key play­
ers in the industry, pay attention to what they are saying about the industry’s 
future. If you aren’t spotting trends there, search “keyword” + trends.
When you scan for opportunities and threats, consider the following factors:
	
✓	Goals: Policies, treaties, and laws that spell out new, more environmen­
tally sustainable goals shape the green economy. Fuel efficiencies and 
renewable energy standards are just a few of the policy goals that are in 
place to inspire industries to find innovative ways to address their busi­
ness. Depending on the industry, these goals could cause your industry 
to boom or falter. 
	
✓	Incentives: Often early-stage industries get a boost from refunds or tax 
credits for consumers or investors. If you notice existing incentives are 
set to expire, pay attention. The expiration of incentives can impact an 
industry, especially if it is still emerging.
	
✓	Disincentives: Capping carbon is a tool to dissuade companies from 
emitting greenhouse gases. For some industries, it’s going to play havoc 
with business-as-usual. Opportunities may appear as a result.
	
✓	Definitions: In all these factors there are definitions that determine which 
side of an incentive or disincentive your industry falls on. Sometimes 
definitions set up by the government don’t coincide with how proponents 
of the industry see the impact of a technology. You must pay attention to 
how this discussion unfolds for your target industry. 

214
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Funding sources: Follow the money to see how your industry is funding 
its growth. Look for discussions about grants, subsidies, venture capital, 
and joint ventures. When funding is flowing, your industry is likely to go 
through a growth spurt. If funding looks like it’s drying up, stay alert, as 
your industry may need to consolidate or restructure to survive.
	
✓	Technological improvements: Enhancements in technologies used in 
your industry also influence its future. If you’re working on one technol­
ogy and breakthroughs happen in another technology, you may feel the 
impact in your business. Always be aware of developments in your gen­
eral industry category, not just your specific segment.
Defining current problems
As you read about your target industry, notice the issues the industry is 
wrestling with right now. Think through the entire value chain, from identi­
fying raw materials to manufacturing the product to end-of-life processes. 
Where in the process is your industry facing the most challenges? 
	
✓	Is there a bottleneck in finding sustainable raw material?
	
✓	Could the product be designed more efficiently to reduce manufacturing 
costs and steps?
	
✓	Is the current distribution channel sustainable?
	
✓	Are branding, marketing, and sales helping the product’s success or not?
	
✓	What happens to the product at the end of its life cycle? 
Use your own expertise in the field or a related field to identify gaps, ineffi­
ciencies, and redundancies the industry must identify. Although you may not 
know all the ins and outs of the industry yet, apply what you do know. You 
may see things from a different perspective that will uncover opportunities 
the industry itself may not be aware of. Your ability to resolve these issues 
makes you attractive to potential employers, especially when you can clearly 
and accurately articulate the issues.
If you’re not looking at a product-focused industry, think through the issues 
associated with providing your service, knowledge, or information. How can 
your industry streamline its efforts to fulfill the needs of customers?
As you identify potential issues, note them. When you talk with people in the 
field, ask about the issues to gain insights and perspective. 

215
 Chapter 14: Getting to Know Your Target Industry
Identifying careers within the industry
With your current understanding, take a look at the careers that exist. Don’t 
just look at the job functions that fit your skills and interests. Take the oppor­
tunity to get a full picture of how work gets done in your industry. You have 
several options for researching job functions:
	
✓	If your professional association has a job board, do a general search to 
pull up all the jobs on the list. Scan job titles to get a sense of the range 
of jobs. Click through to read the full job descriptions as well.
	
✓	Search for information about job titles and careers related to your indus­
try: “keyword” + “job title” or “keyword” + career.
	
✓	Explore LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) for people who have jobs in 
your industry. Take advantage of the company profiles to find compa­
nies within your target industry. (See Chapter 15 for more.)
	
✓	If you find a job function that interests you, enter the job title in a general-
purpose job board or a job board that caters to a specific profession. 
Read over the job listing, paying close attention to task, skill, and educa­
tion requirements. 
	
Don’t be overly concerned if you don’t find a job description that’s a perfect 
fit for your skills. Other positions may exist that you aren’t aware of yet. You 
may discover a peripheral position that is a liaison between two industries 
or departments. The job that’s a good fit may be a consulting position, which 
won’t necessarily show up on a job board. Or you’ll create your own position 
based on your unique set of skills, interests, experience, and education.
	
If you’re targeting an emerging industry that is primarily in a research and 
development phase, you may not find a defined set of job titles. You may need 
to use what you know about the industry and infer the positions that are likely 
to evolve as the industry matures. When companies within your target indus­
try begin to hire depends on where it is in the maturation process.
Taking Your Research to the Source
When you have a good sense of your target industry, turn your attention to 
talking with people who work in it. The more you interact with potential peers, 
the better. Those working in the field you want to work in are your best source 
of information about its current status, local trends, and problems. 

216
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
Identifying whom to talk to
Review your personal contacts, friends, colleagues, former professors, 
former classmates, and family friends. Who do you know who may know 
something about your target industry or who may know people in the indus­
try? Networking in person can also lead to productive connections. If your 
professional association has local chapters, attend a meeting to begin build­
ing relationships with people who know about your field. 
Use social networking connections to identify people within your target 
industry. You may want to do some preliminary research on your own to 
target those you’d like to talk with. Check out your network on LinkedIn and 
Facebook. Try joining a LinkedIn Group for your profession. And pay atten­
tion to people tweeting about your industry (www.twitter.com). If your 
efforts aren’t producing the results you’d like, consider reaching out to the 
people you know to see if they can introduce you to anyone in your field. 
	
Not sure how to use these online networking tools? Worried you don’t have an 
established network? Refer to Chapter 15 for details about how to build your 
network by using in-person and online strategies.
Being comfortable and confident
When you begin talking with professional contacts, you may feel unsure of 
yourself and your purpose. You may slip into a rabbit hole that could bury 
not only your current conversation but future ones as well.
	
Your contact is not your coach or your therapist. They can only help you if 
you’re clear enough about where you want to go that you can describe your 
needs clearly and concisely. If you appear anxious or confused or ask them to 
figure out your career direction for you, you’ve shifted the dynamic of the con­
versation. If your contact feels uncomfortable with your confusion or drama, 
they may not be willing to share what they know or refer you for an opening. 
The key to a successful meeting is to come prepared and focus on what you 
know about your own direction. It’s perfectly normal that you don’t have all 
the answers about your next career. Your contacts understand that. Avoid is 
the temptation to turn to them to determine your future. 
	
No one understands every aspect of the green economy. Not me, not anyone. 
Your contacts know something about their slice of it. What they don’t know 
is how well you’ll fit. You are the best expert on who you are, what you want, 
and where you’re headed. You must determine which career is the best fit for 
you and what steps you will take to reach your green career goal.

 Chapter 14: Getting to Know Your Target Industry
Conducting an informational interview 
that builds your credibility
As you prepare to talk with your contact, focus on questions regarding the 
issues that are at the top of your mind. Begin by creating a clear statement 
of your direction and your goal for the appointment. As you proceed with 
your interview, demonstrate that you’ve done your homework by articulating 
what you know about a subject and then asking your contact to deepen your 
understanding, broaden your perspective, or correct your assumptions. 
	
When Joel was ready to launch his search for a green job, he asked contacts 
if they knew of any openings. Instead of asking, “Do you know any local green 
companies that are hiring?” he was more specific in his requests: 
	
✓	I know about green companies X, Y, and Z in my industry. Do you know 
any other local green companies I’ve missed? 
	
✓	I know company X is hiring people with my skills. I’m doing research on 
companies Y and Z, right now. Are you aware of any openings within 
these three companies? 
	
✓	I’m also exploring career options in city L. So far I’ve identified compa­
nies A, B, and C. I know you used to work in city L. Do you know of any 
other companies I should be aware of? 
By stating the information he has already researched, Joel is demonstrating 
that he is actively pursuing his own job search. He’s not relying on others to 
do the legwork for him. In addition, he is able to ask his contacts very spe­
cific questions to expand what he knows, which allows them to provide him 
with information that is targeted to meet his immediate needs. 
As you prepare for your informational interviews, use the following list as 
a starting point to create your own list of questions for your interview, but 
don’t limit yourself to just these questions. For a 20- to 30-minute informa­
tional interview plan you’ll probably be able to ask only five questions. Put 
the important questions at the top of your list.
	
✓	Understanding your industry in general
 
• “What is the long-term outlook for this industry?”
 
• “What are the pros and cons of working in this industry now?”
 
• “What areas are likely to grow in the next few years?”
 
• Create a question to clarify what you’ve discovered about a trend, 
technology, or regulation that is likely to impact the industry.

218
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Exploring a particular job title
 
• “What is your day like?”
 
• “What are your key responsibilities?”
 
• “What kinds of projects do you work on?” or “What kinds of prob­
lems do you solve for your organization?”
 
• “Who do you interact with most in your position?”
 
• “What are your most favorite and least favorite parts of your job?”
 
• “What kind of training did you have to land this position? What 
kind of training do you recommend?”	
	
✓	Researching an organization
 
• “What do you enjoy about working for your organization?”
 
• “What job did you hold when you first started working here?”
 
• “What do you like most about the company culture here?”
 
• Ask about a company project or initiative you’ve discovered.
	
✓	Identifying your training options
 
• “I want to move into _______ career. I understand that one of my 
options for training is _______. Do you have other training sugges­
tions to prepare me for this career?” 
 
• “I’m exploring schools S and T. Do you know of others schools I 
should explore?” 
 
• “I’m familiar with this certification, but I haven’t run across any 
others. Are there certifications you’d recommend?”
	
If you can pull up reasonably good information on a topic by using Google, 
you’d be better off doing that research on your own. After you’ve reviewed the 
material online, you’ll be in a much better position to ask more-detailed and 
considered questions of your contacts.

t’s all in who you know, especially in the green economy. Whether you are 
exploring your green career options, looking for a green job, or advancing 
your green career, having a network in place improves your results. Thanks 
to various social networking tools you can now expand your networks in 
ways you never could before. 
Experts estimate that only 15–30 percent of jobs are filled as a result of online 
job postings. A full 70–85 percent of jobs are filled through networking con­
nections. In tough economic times, this discrepancy becomes even more 
extreme. Fewer jobs are filled through official job postings, and more jobs are 
filled through networking. 
By building a community of individuals who share your values and goals, 
both online and offline, you have more access to key resources, local job 
openings, news of local companies, and knowledge about the green economy 
in general. 
In this chapter you discover several ways you can build your online network 
and your in-person network. Don’t feel you need to implement every single 
idea in this chapter. Focus instead on the activities that align with your style 
and goals. 
Even after your career exploration and your job search, your network 
becomes your lifeline as your career continues to evolve. Keeping in touch 
with your network, online and off, helps you gain visibility in your field, in 
your companies or organizations, and in your region.

Growing Your Network Online
These days, your online professional network is a critical asset as you 
manage all aspects of your career. Although it takes a bit of motivation and 
dedication to get these online networking systems set up, after they are in 
place, they become an integral part of how you cultivate your network.
The good news is you can have some fun while building your network. Set 
aside 15 to 20 minutes a day to create your profile and begin connecting with 
current colleagues and people you knew in previous jobs, through school, or 
in volunteer organizations. Before you know it, the process of checking your 
social networking sites and engaging in conversations becomes second nature.
Always control your image
	
Think before you post. Always pay attention to what you say on your social 
networking pages. What you say — about yourself, your coworkers, your 
employers, and your work — will remain online for a very long time. If you’d 
be embarrassed to explain an update, photo, or comment to a prospective 
employer, don’t post it. Bottom line, be as professional online as you are 
when interacting in person. 
Be careful not to let your attitude leak into your posts as well. If you’ve had a 
bad day or you’ve had it up to here with your boss or a coworker, it’s prob­
ably not the best time to post an update. Remember that your comments give 
prospective employers a view into your personality and your work habits. 
Never post comments about a bad interview or a bad job offer. If you choose 
to do so, keep the name of the company or the person you interviewed with 
out of the comment. But remember, it’s entirely possible that your prospec­
tive employer is linked up with you or someone in the office is, and they will 
be able to connect the dots to determine you are talking about the offer they 
just made you. That’s probably not the tone you want to set for your next 
interaction with a prospective employer.
Continue to watch the content and the tone of your online posts even after 
you’ve become employed. People have been fired for speaking too freely 
about proprietary information on blogs and social networking sites. 
Ultimately, it is up to you to manage the impression people have of you 
through your online profiles. In addition to tracking your own posts as you 
make them, you may also want to monitor what others are saying about you. If 
you are concerned about what may be on the Web about you, do a search on 
your name with your favorite search engine. Consider variations of your name

as well. Review the first ten pages of links to see what’s being said about you. 
If there is something you find offensive, do what you can to erase the damage. 
If you aren’t able to get the offensive material removed, read this Newsweek 
article (www.newsweek.com/id/109612) to understand your options. 
Linking into LinkedIn
LinkedIn is the main social networking application people use to create, 
maintain, and enhance their business relationships. The 47 million contacts 
registered on LinkedIn represent more than 100,000 companies, 170 indus­
tries, and 200 countries. When you register and build your network, you have 
immediate access to your own contacts, your contacts’ contacts, and those 
contacts’ contacts. On LinkedIn, these three levels of contacts are referred to 
as first, second, and third degree contacts, respectively.
You can join LinkedIn by pointing your browser at www.linkedin.com.
	
1.	Create your own LinkedIn profile. 
 
• Set up your professional headline. This may be your current job 
title or a description of your strengths. In this section, you also 
select your industry from a drop-down menu. Your professional 
headline and your selected industry appear under your name any 
time your name is shown to your contacts and contacts who are 
reviewing your profile. 
 
• Create a summary of your professional experience and your 
goals. This is a free-form text area that allows you to describe what 
you’ve done in the past, what you are doing now, and what you are 
interested in doing in the future. 
 
• Enter your work experience. Start with your most current posi­
tion. Enter your title, company, industry, dates, and a description 
of your position. Then repeat the process for your other positions.
 
• Describe your education. In this section, provide the name of 
your schools, your field(s) of study, dates you were in school, your 
activities and societies, and any additional notes you’d like to add 
about your studies.
 
• Add additional information. List your Web sites, blogs, and inter­
ests in this section.
 
• Decide how you want people to contact you. You choose whether 
you just want introductions or introductions and InMail messages, 
which are proprietary messages sent within LinkedIn. You also 
indicate the kind of opportunities you want to receive and the best 
way for contacts to communicate with you. 

222
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
 
• Upload your photograph. Profiles without photographs make it 
harder for people to connect. They may not recognize your name, 
but if they see your face, they know they met you at the conference 
last month. Make it easier for people to find you and recognize you 
by adding your photograph, preferably a photo with a professional 
image or an image that speaks to your personal brand. A graphic 
designer might get away with a caricature of themselves, but the 
rest of us would have a hard time pulling that off.	
	
2.	Add contacts to your profile. Begin by searching for and inviting col­
leagues you know and trust into your network. 
	
	 Keep in mind that you may be contacted at some point in the future by 
someone in your extended network requesting an introduction to your 
first-degree connections. If you don’t know your contacts well, you may 
feel uncomfortable making the introduction. That said, how closely you 
monitor your connections may depend on your goals. Some only invite 
people they have worked with or known for a long time. Others have 
more of an open-door policy and will invite people they met at a meeting 
or conference (or hotel bar, as the case may be) to join their network. 
	
	 Use a combination of the following three methods to build your network.
 
• Type in the name of a colleague into the search bar in the upper-
right corner of your screen. Review the list of names to locate your 
colleague. You can narrow your search by using the fields on the 
right side of your results. Click on the person’s name to see their 
profile. In the upper-right corner, click the link Add ___ to Your 
Network. On the next screen, indicate how you know your col­
league, personalize the invitation, and click Send Invitation. 
 
• If you know a person’s name and e-mail address, you can invite 
them directly. Click on the Contacts link on the left navigation 
bar. Then click the Add link in the upper-right side of the header. 
Although there is a form to add several contacts at the same time, 
you get a better response if you customize your invitation for each 
person you invite. Enter one contact’s first name, last name, and 
e-mail. Then click on the Edit/Preview Invitation Text link and per­
sonalize your message to your contact. 
 
• When you receive an invitation from a contact, you’ll receive a 
notification via e-mail (unless you’ve modified your settings). Click 
through to the invitation from the e-mail. If you know the person 
and want to add them to your network, click Accept. If you would 
prefer not to connect, Click Archive. Don’t click the link that indi­
cates you don’t know the person because doing so impacts their 
ability to connect with others. If your contact has just sent you the 
default invitation, you may want to reply to their message to ask 
them how they know you. With more information, you may be will­
ing to accept their invitation. 

223
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
	
	 If you’re concerned about who will contact you if you are listed in the net­
work, don’t be. You can set up your preferences in a way that allows you to 
access the network and control the amount and kind of inquiries you 
receive from others in the network. Actually, it’s recommended that you 
don’t share your direct contact information, but rather rely on the InMail 
system that’s built into the network. You can receive messages without 
anyone ever knowing your personal contact information.
	
3.	Begin exploring LinkedIn to get a sense of how powerful the tool is for 
your career exploration, job search, and building your network. 
 
• To search for people based on current or previous title, company, 
industry, location, and interests, click the People tab in the top 
navigation bar. When you have a list of contacts, you can then sort 
the list based on how close their relationship is to you, how often 
they are recommended, how many connections they have, and 
how relevant they are to your keywords. You can perform these 
searches for the entire network or one of your LinkedIn groups 
(more on groups later in the chapter).
 
• Find job openings by clicking the Jobs tab on the top navigation 
bar. Enter your target keywords and your preferred location infor­
mation, click Search, and the list of matching job opportunities 
shows up. If you are a member of a LinkedIn group, you can also 
click the Jobs link within that group to see what jobs are listed. 
 
• Use the Questions tab on the top navigation bar to put out queries 
to particular contacts or everyone on LinkedIn. Use your questions 
to get an overall view of a particular industry or resolve a stum­
bling block. You can also answer questions to build your credibil­
ity around the topics you respond to. 
 
• The Companies tab allows you to search for companies by using 
company name, keywords, geographic location, or industry cat­
egory. From the list of companies you can determine where the 
company is located and how many employees work at the com­
pany. By clicking the link to the company, you find a description 
of the company and their specialties, as well as lists of people on 
LinkedIn who currently work at the company or did work there at 
one time. Sidebar information provides links to related companies 
and key statistics about the company.
	
4.	Explore your own presence on LinkedIn. 
 
• The left navigation bar gives you immediate access to a status 
page that lists updates your contacts have made to their profiles, 
your groups, your profile, your contacts, and your LinkedIn inbox. 
You can also explore reading list possibilities, events, and blog 
posts by your network under the Applications heading on the left 
navigation bar.

Tweeting on Twitter
If you think Twitter is just about sharing what you ate for lunch or what your 
child said at the grocery store, think again. With the right tools, Twitter can 
become a treasure trove of contacts, information, and resources to help you 
establish yourself in your target industry. 
First you must be clear about your reason for being on Twitter. Is your plan 
just to chat with folks and have fun? Or do you want to use Twitter to explore 
green topics, connect with people in your field, or find valuable resources for 
your career quest? You’ll use the tool differently depending on your answer. 
For the sake of this section, I assume that you are using it to gain new insights 
and connections within your target industry and the green economy in general. 
Begin by going to Twitter.com (www.twitter.com) to register and set up 
your profile. This doesn’t take much time at all. 
	
1.	Join Twitter. Fill out the form with your full name, your username 
(which will be included in your Twitter Web address and will accom­
pany all your twitter posts), your password, and your e-mail address. 
	
2.	Set up your profile using the Settings button. The more information 
you fill out, the more likely people are to follow you. 
 
• Confirm your name and username. Make sure that they are the 
way you want them to be. 
	
	After being on Twitter several weeks, I ended up changing my 
name to Green Career Central and keeping my username as 
CarolMcClelland so that people coming to my Twitter page would 
make the connection between my personal name and my busi­
ness name. Watch your tweets and invitation e-mails for a while to 
determine how you want to establish your own Twitter brand. 
 
• Enter your location. If you feel more comfortable, use the name of 
your region rather than your hometown. Having some geographic 
anchor helps people get a sense of who you are and how you relate 
to their world. 
 
•	Add a Web site link. If you have a Web site or a blog that relates 
to your professional goals, choose one or the other. You can also 
use the link to your LinkedIn profile. 

225
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
 
• Write a 160-character biography. Be as informative and concise 
as you can in your description of who you are and what your focus 
is. This is the only information people have about you when they 
decide whether to follow you or not. 
 
• Upload your photo. Or if you must, a professional-looking logo or 
icon. If you are using Twitter professionally, this is probably not 
the place for your Second Life avatar to make an appearance.
 
• Keep your updates public. That’s the whole point of being on Twitter. 
	
3.	Tweak your page. You can play around with the look and feel of your 
profile page by going to Settings/Design. Ideally, you want to use your 
Twitter profile to communicate your personal brand. To get started you 
can choose one of the designs offered by Twitter. You can return any 
time to customize your profile by uploading a background image. As you 
connect with people, notice which profiles you want to use as inspira­
tion for your own background.
As soon as you have your profile set up, it’s time to get started with your 
Twitter life! You probably already know that a language has developed 
around this particular social networking tool. Familiarize yourself with the 
following list of terms as you get your feet wet. Before too long, these words 
will become part of your everyday speech. Yes, really!
	
✓	Tweet: A tweet is a 140-character message through your Twitter account, 
your iPhone, or through your TweetDeck. You can set it up so that your 
tweets (the messages you post) also show up as your Facebook status 
update (see more about Facebook in the next section). What should you 
tweet about? It’s perfectly acceptable to tweet about what you are doing 
(especially if you are doing something exciting, interesting, or funny), or to 
jot down inspiring quotes, informative resources, links to things you find 
interesting, recommendations, your thoughts on a topic, and things you are 
celebrating. Let your excitement and passion come through your tweets. 
	
✓	Follow: Building your network on Twitter is a two-way street. You want 
to follow people who are interesting to you and you want people to 
follow you because they are intrigued by what you tweet about. If you 
see someone tweeting about something you are interested in, click their 
username to check out their profile and other tweets. Then make a deci­
sion about whether you want to follow them or not. You don’t have to 
follow everyone who follows you. 
	
	Follow strategically. These people are your early-warning system for 
breaking news. They are your research team to help you spot trends and 
find meaty articles about your topic of interest. They are your sounding 
board when you have a question. Be selective so that the tweets you 
receive are relevant to you and worth your time to read. You can always 
unfollow someone without them knowing you’ve left their list. 

226
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Reply (@): By putting the @ sign in front of someone’s username in a 
tweet, you are sending them a message that all those on Twitter can 
see. You can use a reply to compliment, thank, or congratulate another 
person. You can also reply to ask a question or engage them in a con­
versation about one of their tweets or a common interest. Remember, 
others see these tweets and you want them to because this is one of the 
ways you become known. Someone new may see your reply, like what 
you have to say, and then choose to follow you. 
	
✓	Direct Message (DM): Use direct messages sparingly, with people you 
truly know, when you want to converse privately. Some people set up an 
automated direct message to thank new followers for following. Others 
find these messages to be a bit over the top. You need to decide where 
you stand on this issue after you become more familiar with Twitter.
	
✓	Retweet (RT): If you see a tweet that engages you, retweet it to your own 
followers by putting an RT in front of the original sender’s username. 
Retweeting is much appreciated by the original tweeter as long as you 
are forwarding information the original author wants to share with the 
world. 
	
✓	Hashtags or Twitter Memes (#): If you find a hashtag, a # with a word 
or series of letters following it, you can do a Twitter search (see details 
that follow) to pull up all the tweets that include that tag.
	
	Some organizations create a hashtag for conferences, classes, or other 
shared events so that everyone tweeting from the event can follow 
everyone else’s tweets. This is especially helpful if you can’t attend a 
conference and want to enjoy the conference vicariously. If you are at a 
conference, find out what the hashtag is so your tweets can demonstrate 
your expertise and show the world you attended the event.
	
	Others establish a hashtag to track comments about a particular topic. 
Watch for #green or #greentweets, which indicate the associated mes­
sage is about a green topic. Remember, you can use these as a search 
term to bring up a complete list of these tweets.
	
	Twitter Memes look like hashtags but carry a special meaning and 
inspire people to tweet in a certain manner on a given day. The first 
Twitter Meme was #followfriday (sometimes shortened to #ff), used 
when people send tweets with the usernames of those they enjoy fol­
lowing. A newer Twitter Meme is #ecomonday when people forward the 
usernames of people who tweet about green topics. Google “Twitter 
Meme” to uncover the meaning of other common memes. 
Twitter tools make your Twitter experience more productive and focused. In 
fact, they completely transformed my thinking about Twitter. With the right 
tools you can follow topics, search for key terms, and connect with people 
who follow the topics you follow.

227
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
	
✓	TweetDeck (www.tweetdeck.com): This free software provides you 
with a personal browser you can use on your desktop for your tweeting 
pleasure. You design the browser to show what you want to see. In addi­
tion to seeing the tweets from your followers, you can also set up search 
terms such that any tweets that include your chosen terms show up on 
your TweetDeck. It’s a great way to make connections with those in your 
field of interest. (Setting up this tool completely changed my experience 
of Twitter, for the better.)
	
✓	Twitter Search (http://search.twitter.com): This search engine 
for Twitter allows you to enter a couple of keywords or hashtags. The 
results display all the tweets that include those terms in real time. This 
function is helpful if you want to gain insights about a particular topic, 
to get a quick update on a current event, or to find other people who are 
tweeting about the topics that are near and dear to your heart. 
	
✓	Twellow Pages (www.twellow.com): This site is called the yellow 
pages of Twitter, for good reason. You can add your own listing, iden­
tifying your other social networking applications and your chosen cat­
egories. In addition, you can search categories for people you want to 
connect with. 
	
✓	Twellowhood (www.twellow.com/twellowhood) and LocalTweeps 
(www.localtweeps.com): Take your search local. Use either of these 
sites to search for tweeps (people who tweet) in your local area. 
	
✓	WeFollow (www.wefollow.com): Enter a keyword tag in the upper-
right corner of this Web site to pull a list of tweeps who are interested 
in that topic. A great tool for finding people you may want to follow. You 
can add yourself to WeFollow as well. As you set up your account, you 
select three tags you follow so people can find you.
	
Don’t attempt to activate all these Twitter-related services in one sitting! Start 
with the basics by setting up your account, creating your profile, tweeting, 
and following. The next step is to download TweetDeck. TweetDeck makes it 
easier to find people to follow. From there it all begins to snowball. 
Networking with Facebook or MySpace
Facebook (www.facebook.com) and MySpace (www.myspace.com) are 
primarily set up for connecting with friends. As a result, much of what gets 
posted is very social in nature, with photos, family activities, and partying. 
MySpace has a tendency to focus on the social side of life even more than 
Facebook. 

228
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
You can use Facebook to connect with individuals you know and those 
you meet. By tracking people’s updates, you gain an understanding of your 
friends’ passions and interests. When you discover a shared connection, 
reach out to them by commenting on their updates or adding a comment on 
their wall. Use these conversations, whether public or private, to strengthen 
your relationships. 
Although you can’t search for people who are interested in a specific topic or 
those outside your network who work in a specific company, you can browse 
their profiles and their groups to discover their interests and affiliations. This 
level of research is not as easy to do on Facebook as it is on LinkedIn and 
Twitter.
Use your own posts to reflect your green career quest. Are you exploring an 
industry? Researching a particular company? Investigating a certain green 
job title? As part of your post you might put out queries or requests for 
resources to your friends periodically. Be sure to link to your LinkedIn profile 
so your contacts can read your full professional background when they want. 
	
Beware: Your social networking profiles aren’t just for your family and friends 
to see. According to a recent survey by Careerbuilder.com, 20 percent of 
employers search online networking profiles for information about prospec­
tive job candidates. The good news is that 24 percent of the hiring managers 
in the study found content on social networking profiles that helped them 
decide to hire a candidate. Lesson here is to make sure that your social net­
working profiles and posts project your professional identify. 
On the flip side, employers may run into information that’s not so flattering. 
If you or your friends tend to post photos of your social activities on a Friday 
night or they provide too much information about your behavior or their 
own, you may need to rethink your social networking strategy.
	
Review and test your privacy settings to make sure that only your friends 
have access to your personal profile. Consider starting a networking page on 
another site to build your professional network. 
	
If you want to step out of the traditional job search box, consider using 
Facebook to do an ad campaign to target your ideal company or industry. 
Although this is a fairly new use of social networking sites, the participants in 
this study, a study by One Day One Job (www.onedayonejob.com/blog/
use-facebook-ads-to-make-employers-hunt-you-down), report a 
number of wins as a result of their targeted ads. Check out the article for more 
details.

 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
Discovering Like-Minded People
In addition to using social networks to build your own community, each net­
working tool has a system to connect with people who share the same values 
and interests. To expand your network and stay connected to those in your 
field, consider adding groups to your social networking mix. 
	
Groups are a particularly good way to dip your toe into a potentially interest­
ing industry. You can always drop out of the group if it doesn’t match your 
interests after all. 
	
✓	LinkedIn Groups (www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory): After set­
ting up your LinkedIn profile, click Groups in the left navigation bar of 
your account. Use the Search Groups fields to pull up groups that relate 
to your interests. You can sign up for up to 50 groups. Groups let you 
connect with others, ask questions, review job listings, and read news.
	
✓	Twibes (www.twibes.com): You have probably already guessed that 
this group is related to Twitter in some way just by the funny name that 
begins with Tw. Use your Web browser to access the Twibes Web site. 
Then click Twibe Groups to browse the list of twibes. A number of green 
twibes are listed under Ecology/Green, including one on green careers. 
If anyone in the twibe uses the group’s keywords in their tweets, their 
tweets are reposted on the twibes profile. This is another effective way 
to find people you want to flock with. 
	
✓	Facebook Pages (www.facebook.com): The best way to access the 
group search area is to put a topic in the search box on the upper-right 
corner of your screen. From there you can use tabs to select pages (typi­
cally organizations and businesses, groups, and events). Click on each 
tab to find the entries for your keyword. Another handy and sometimes 
more effective way to find groups you are interested in is to notice which 
groups your friends belong to or post about. When in a group, you can 
connect with others in the group, join chats, post on the wall, and more.
	
Quality is more important than quantity. Explore your options and then select 
the groups that are most closely aligned with your needs and interests.
Meeting in Person 
Although building an online network allows you to create a broad reach, you 
can leverage it by building face-to-face relationships that bring your network 
home, to your local community. Having a strong local community helps you 
understand your local green economy.

As you prepare to meet people face to face, create a business card you can 
hand to people who want to stay in touch. Keep it simple with your name, con­
tact information, and a short title or tagline about your interests. Remember, 
the first impression is what sticks. Investing just a few dollars in a card with a 
simple design element and professional printing is worth it.
Volunteering
Volunteering is one of the most effective ways to build your local network 
because you have a role to play, and in that role it’s easy to reach out to talk 
with people you might not otherwise connect with. Through your activities, 
you are able to build skills that are relevant to your career goals, add leader­
ship experiences to your resume, share your strengths, gain valuable hands-
on knowledge, and grow in areas you want to develop.
Volunteer for a cause you believe in, whether it is community based, environ­
mentally focused, or socially responsible. Don’t just volunteer because it will 
look good on your resume. Give your time because it feels good to make a dif­
ference and it builds out your resume. If you can identify a project or group 
that aligns with your values and career goals, all the better.
The stronger your personal connection with the cause, the more you can 
demonstrate your passion and excitement. The people you work with — 
organizers, sponsors, and other volunteers — will notice and recall the extra 
zing you brought to the project. You want them to remember you when oppor­
tunities come up for media coverage, meeting with a prospective funder, inter­
acting with an elected official, or taking on a larger, paid leadership role.
Set up your volunteer work so it works for you. Perhaps your schedule dic­
tates that you work on a series of individual short-term projects. Or you have 
the ability to arrange your schedule around a regular volunteer shift on a 
weekly basis. Whatever you commit to, be prepared to follow through. Do all 
you can to demonstrate that you are reliable and dependable. 
	
Christine has volunteered for more than 60 different organizations over the 
last 30 years. She has such a desire to give that she can become overextended 
if she’s not careful. Recently she created a set of criteria to evaluate how she 
wants to get involved in the organization. First, the organization needs to 
be close to where she lives so she doesn’t expend a lot of time, energy, and 
money traveling. Second, the group must align with her values, passions, and 
interests. Third, the opportunity must help her reach her goals in some way, 
whether it’s helping her gain experience, build a new skill, develop a new 
network, or give her new insights about the field. Taking this more strategic 
approach to her volunteering efforts has allowed her to focus on the opportu­
nities that allow her to give in a way that also feeds her future. 
One of the biggest benefits of volunteering is being able to plug into an exist­
ing network of people who share your values. Take the opportunity to get to 

231
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
know the people you are volunteering with. Be available to talk when oppor­
tunities present themselves. Be strategic in who you meet by being prepared. 
Do your homework so you know who is affiliated with the organization. If you 
discover one of the funders, executives, or sponsors would be a good con­
nection for you, introduce yourself at events, or request an introduction after 
you’ve been part of the organization a while. 
	
Although Jonathan was out of work and struggling to build his own consulting 
business, he remained active and volunteered for environmental groups in his 
area. During a creek cleanup in his community, the sponsor for the event came 
over and introduced himself. Turns out he was the president of an engineer­
ing consulting firm in the area. He picked up on Jonathan’s passion about the 
environment and the task at hand by watching him interact with volunteers 
during the day. After a meeting or two, Jonathan accepted a full-time position 
at this engineering firm. How sweet is that! 
	
When you leave the volunteer organization, ask for a written recommendation 
for your records. Or have someone from the organization add a recommenda­
tion to your LinkedIn page for all to see.
Wondering where to find volunteer organizations in your area? Use the fol­
lowing volunteer categories as a starting point. Exploring your community 
may bring additional opportunities to light.
	
✓	Green teams: Check to see if your city or region has an active green team 
that is sponsored by the city or has grown from a grass-roots effort. Green 
teams are very active programs to encourage residents and businesses to 
go green. Get involved and you’ll meet individuals committed to the envi­
ronment and community. Check to see if your city has an environmentally 
focused commission where you could play a role in your city’s future.
 	
✓	Cool Cities (www.coolcities.us): Cool Cities is a Sierra Club cam­
paign to turn North America green, one city at a time. Click the map to 
discover Cool Cities teams in your area.
	
✓	Environmental nonprofits: Do some research in your area to discover 
organizations working on environmental projects or issues. You may 
find hands-on projects, activist campaigns, or fundraising opportunities. 
	
✓	Volunteer center: Search the Web for a volunteer center in your area. 
These centers are designed to match volunteers with projects. 
	
✓	Idealist (www.idealist.org): Use this search engine to find volunteer 
activities in your area that match your target keywords and focus.
	
✓	Networking groups: Networking groups often need volunteers to keep the 
meetings going. Another opportunity exists if your region doesn’t yet have 
a green/sustainability networking group. Take the lead to build a group in 
your community — you’ll get to know everyone in the area and they will 
see you as a leader. Check out the networking groups listed in the section 
“Taking part in local networking meetings” later in this chapter. 

232
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
If you aren’t able to volunteer in person due to your travel schedule or personal 
responsibilities, look for volunteer activities you can do virtually. Whether the 
volunteer organization is in town or across the globe, you doall your work from 
your own computer. Check out Volunteer Match (www.volunteermatch.org) 
or Idealist (www.idealist.org) for possibilities.
Attending eco-friendly fairs and festivals
Fairs, festivals, and job fairs also bring people together who believe strongly 
in issues of sustainability. Watch for local advertising, especially around 
Earth Day, April 22. You might also do a Web search for green fairs or festi­
vals in your region. While at the event, take advantage of the opportunity to 
immerse yourself in all things green:
	
✓	Speakers: Scan the program to discover who is speaking when. Mark 
the talks you want to attend. Listen carefully, take notes, and ask a 
question. If you have the opportunity, connect with the speaker after 
the presentation.
	
✓	Exhibitors: Review the list of exhibitors before the event to identify any 
potential employers, interesting associations, or nonprofits. Take advan­
tage of the opportunity to gain new insights about each organization. 
Pick up their literature or note their Web address for future research. 
Strike up a conversation about getting involved. Be prepared to express 
your interests clearly and concisely. You never know who they know or 
what needs they have. Collect business cards. 
	
✓	Sponsors: Although you may not have an opportunity to interact 
with sponsors of the event, you can still glean some important clues 
that could be useful to you in the future. Often larger companies are 
sponsors. Perhaps you notice one of the largest employers in town 
is a sponsor of the event. If you didn’t know that they had green inter­
ests before, you may want to investigate that company more closely 
in the future.
	
✓	Other participants: During the day, notice the participants who ask 
meaningful questions during the presentations or are having lengthy 
conversations at the booths. If the opportunity arises, strike up a con­
versation while waiting for a talk to start, grabbing a bite to eat, or wait­
ing to talk with people at a booth. 
	
✓	Volunteers: Those donating their time to support the event are likely to 
be just as passionate about green topics as you are. If you have enough 
lead time, find out how you can volunteer at the event and then get to 
know your fellow volunteers. If you miss the deadline, pay attention to 
the volunteers that are engaged and happy to be there. Ask them how 
they became involved. Inquire about what they do in their profession or 
how they became interested in sustainability. 

233
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
	
If you can’t attend the actual event, glean as much information as you can 
from the sponsors, exhibitors, and speakers listed on the event Web site. Use 
Web searches to explore these groups online. If you find something of interest, 
call up the organization. Mention that you found their information through the 
festival Web site. Swing by the Web site after the event to see if they’ve posted 
any photographs or videos from the event. 
Participating in conferences
Attending a conference for your profession, industry, or trade can also be 
a powerful experience. Imagine arriving at a meeting where every person in 
attendance is interested in and passionate about the same topics you are. New 
ideas, opportunities, and connections often surface throughout the conference.
As the meeting begins, set the intention to soak up as much information 
as you can about the industry and profession. Listen to keynote speakers, 
attend breakout sessions, and check out the exhibitors. Pay particular atten­
tion to information about cutting-edge trends, technological advancements, 
and any changes to the business climate due to regulations or incentives. 
At times you may feel like you are drinking water out of a fire hose. Use the 
following strategies to make the most of the conference: 
	
✓	Take copious notes so you can integrate all the details later.
	
✓	Notice the key players throughout the meeting. Who is running the 
show? Who is being honored for their contributions over the years? 
Catch the names of these players and connect the dots as you discover 
more about the organization. 
	
✓	Meet your peers during breaks, receptions, and meals. If you plan to 
attend year after year, this part will become easier because you’ll be able 
to build on the relationships you started the first year you attended. 
	
✓	As the conference winds down, take stock of what you’ve discovered. Is 
the industry viable? Is it moving in a direction that matches your goals? 
Do you have the skills you need to succeed in the industry? Or, if you 
don’t have the skills, what should you do to prepare to enter the field? 
	
✓	Do you feel at home with this group of people? Do they think the way 
you do? Is their assessment of problems and situations similar to yours? 
Do you understand and laugh at their jokes? 
	
	Although it may sound crazy, the last question is more important than 
you may think. Every profession has a certain sense of humor that 
doesn’t always transfer well. If you found yourself laughing at the humor 
during the meeting, chances are fairly good you feel comfortable with 
those in this profession. If their humor doesn’t sit well with you, take a 
hard look at the industry as a whole to understand where the discon­
nect is. It may be that your underlying goals are different. 

234
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
If you can’t attend a conference, study the Web site for as many clues as you 
can about the industry as a whole, the key players, and the trends. If there is 
any indication that they plan to stream any of the talks, return to the Web site 
to watch them. You may also be able to purchase recordings of the presenta­
tions after the conference. Check to see if they’ve announced their next con­
ference and explore the option of volunteering at next year’s conference. 
Taking part in local networking meetings
Engaging in networking groups in your community is another effective strat­
egy to build your local network. The recurring nature of a networking group 
means that you are likely to recognize more and more people each time you 
attend a meeting. In addition, there’s some likelihood that people you know 
through your volunteer efforts will also attend these meetings. Seeing familiar 
faces in the room makes networking far more enjoyable and more effective. 
Check out your professional association’s Web site to discover whether it 
supports local chapters. Although you may feel a bit uneasy as you enter 
your first meeting, give it a chance. Let the people at the registration desk 
know that it’s your first meeting so they can introduce you to others. Give 
yourself a few meetings before you determine whether or not it’s for you. 
Combat your uneasiness by inviting a friend to attend the meeting with you 
or by becoming active in the organization. Taking on a role gives you a task 
to do at meetings and allows you to talk with people for a specific purpose. 
Local green networking groups are another option. Check out the following 
organizations to determine if there is a group meeting near you: 
	
✓	Eco Tuesday (www.ecotuesday.com): This networking forum is for 
those interested in sustainable business. The group meets on the fourth 
Tuesday of the month in several major cities and is growing. You can 
apply to be an ambassador to bring the network to your city.
	
✓	Green Drinks (www.greendrinks.org): People in the environmental 
field from NGOs, academia, government and business, gather for drinks 
once a month. This group grows organically in many countries and cities 
around the world. Find a gathering near you on the site.
	
✓	Net Impact (www.netimpact.org): This global network is for those 
using business to change the world as students, graduate students, and 
professionals. Use the Find a Chapter option on the site to find a map of 
all the international and United States–based groups. 
	
✓	Business Alliance for Local Living Economies (www.livingeconomies.
org/netview): These meetings are for local businesses, government offi­
cials, economic development professionals, social innovators, and commu­
nity leaders who are building local economies. Check the link for meetings 
in your area. 

235
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
	
If you are receiving outplacement support, check with the organization to see 
if there’s an informal subgroup that has formed to explore green, cleantech, or 
sustainable career options. 
Enrolling in classes
Taking classes or attending presentations gives you ample opportunities to 
meet people locally. Check your local adult education program, community 
college, or university for classes or speakers that add to your knowledge 
about green, environmental, or sustainable topics. 
Whether you attend an evening talk or a semester-long course, use the 
opportunity to expand your network. Make an effort to introduce yourself to 
the instructor or speaker facilitating the event. Ask a question about the pre­
sentation or follow up on a point made during the session. If possible, collect 
contact information so that you can thank them for their presentation. 
Your classmates are likely to share your goals and interests. Be open to 
engaging in conversation. Participate actively in discussions, study groups, 
and team projects. Find ways to connect with those who share your commit­
ment to the class, the cause, and their own future. See Chapter 16 for more 
tips on how to find the best classes for you. 
Leveraging the Contacts You Make
Meeting people once does not a network make. A network is a collection of 
people you can reach out to with questions about your target field, requests 
for referrals, and information about your local green economy. To create a 
strong network, you must nurture the relationships as soon as you’ve made 
the first connection. After making contact, invite your contact to meet with 
you one-on-one, develop a strategy to follow up with your contacts, and keep 
them up-to-date with your progress.
Your first step is to enter your contact into your personal database and to 
find your contact on your favorite social networking applications. If you can’t 
locate them immediately, check your contact’s e-mail signature and Web site 
for indications about which social networking applications he or she is using. 
Scheduling one-on-one meetings
When you meet someone of interest at a networking event, conference, or 
volunteer activity, contact them to set up a time to get together. If you live 
near each other, getting together for coffee, lunch, or even a walk may work 

236
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
well for both of you. In-person meetings tend to be enjoyable and establish a 
strong bond. If you aren’t able to meet in person due to geographic distance 
or scheduling conflicts, set up a time to talk by phone. Don’t despair, you can 
definitely develop meaningful connections through phone meetings. 
Planning for your meeting
As you prepare for your networking meeting, take some time to identify your 
main goals for your conversation. Look for how your needs overlap with your 
contact’s work experience and interests.
Begin by discovering as much as you can about the person. Recall anything 
you already know from your previous conversations. Then read your con­
tact’s LinkedIn profile. (If you haven’t done so already, send an invitation to 
your contact to connect via LinkedIn.) Google their name or company to find 
newspaper articles or online descriptions of his or her work. You might also 
explore YouTube to discover videos they’ve done as part of their work. 
When you have a sense of the person, look at your goals for the meeting. What 
do you want to discover through your conversation? Pinpoint the topics that 
you think the person will be qualified to answer based on their training, work 
experience, education, current position, and personal interests. Create a list of 
three to five questions based on the following goals that meet your needs:
	
✓	Understanding your target industry in more depth
	
✓	Identifying the trends, opportunities, and problems facing industry
	
✓	Exploring possible job titles within the industry and confirming that they 
match your skills
	
✓	Determining training requirements to work in the industry
	
✓	Finding local companies that hire people in your field
	
✓	Pinpointing potential job openings that would be a fit for you
Refer to the comments about how to use the interview to increase your credi­
bilityin Chapter 14 for specific questions you can ask your contacts.
	
Remember, first impressions count. Be respectful of your contact and their 
time. Keep your conversation focused and enjoyable at the same time. Be sure 
to ask engaging questions that allow them to share who they are. You might 
ask what they like about their job and how they got involved in the green 
industry. Listening to their answers will give you insights and help you frame 
your questions more effectively.

237
 Chapter 15: Connecting with the Green Movement
Making the most of your meeting
Use the following guidelines to envision your networking meeting. Generally, 
this pattern will be productive for most situations. 
	
✓	Spend some time getting to know each other. Through your conversa­
tion, find interests, people, and organizations you may have in common. 
	
✓	Gain more insights about something related to your target industry. 
Perhaps you want to discover more information about an organization, a 
project, or a profession that your contact has experience with. 
	
✓	Toward the end of the conversation, ask your contact for referrals. 
You may ask a general question, such as, do you know anyone else I 
should talk with? Or you may want to be more specific. You could ask 
for referrals in a particular organization or professional association. 
	
✓	Ask if your contact is aware of any companies that are hiring or may 
hire in the near future. Don’t ask this question if you are unclear about 
your career direction and never lead with this question. Build a rapport 
first. You may even want to wait until a subsequent conversation to get 
into the conversation about job openings. 
	
✓	Ask how you can be of service to your contact. Do they need information 
you may be able to provide? Are they wrestling with any work problems 
you may have insights about? 
	
Focus on what you know about your direction. Review comments about how 
to use your interview to increase your credibility in Chapter 14.
Following up after your meeting
After your meeting, be sure to follow up with your contact. Write a thank-you 
note or e-mail in appreciation of their time and insights. In your note be spe­
cific about how your contact helped you.
	
If you promised to research something for them or to send them a resource, 
be sure to follow through on your commitment. Your overall goal is to build 
a strong relationship with this person so you can return to them as your job 
search develops. You want to demonstrate that you are on top of things, that 
you are on time, and that you follow through on your word. 

238
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
Strengthening your relationships
As your journey continues, communicate your status to your entire network. 
If you change your direction in response to your networking meetings and 
your own online research, let your contacts know your current goal. Thank 
them for whatever role they played in helping you gain more clarity. 
Be sure to connect with your contacts regularly through your social networking 
applications. Comment on their posts, congratulate them on developments in 
their lives, and contribute to questions they may pose online. When you see 
something that will be of interest to one of your contacts, reach out to them 
with that information.
When you land your new position or achieve another major milestone, be in 
touch with your contacts. Networking contacts love to hear about your prog­
ress. Continue to thank your contacts as you celebrate your achievements.
Your network continues to play an active role in your career even after 
you’ve found your next position. Contacts can help you think out-of-the-box 
when you are wrestling with a problem at work; they can mentor you as you 
stretch into new roles, and they can offer support as you move through vari­
ous professional, and perhaps personal, transitions in your life. 
	
Keep in mind that a networking relationship is always a two-way street. Just 
as they are helping you progress in your career, you can contribute to their 
professional development as well.

W
ith the green economy growing and changing as it is, you will most likely 
need to update your skills and knowledge periodically throughout your 
career. Use the suggestions in this chapter whether you are taking classes to test 
out a new career idea, preparing to move into a new career, adding green know-
how to your resume, or maintaining your edge in an existing career. 
	
If the thought of getting additional training makes your skin crawl or your 
stomach sink, don’t give up on your green career goals just yet. Green educa­
tion options come in all shapes and sizes, from local one-time classes to online 
courses, from certificate programs to full-fledged degrees. Keep an open mind 
as you explore your green education options. You may discover a solution 
that works surprisingly well for you.
Identifying What You Need 
to Know to Succeed
One of the questions I hear most frequently is what training should I get to enter 
the green economy? There is no single answer to that question. The training you 
undertake depends entirely on the green career you target. Refer to Chapters 4 
through 6 for information about how to identify your green career goal. 
	
Keep in mind that the training requirements for many green careers are likely 
to evolve as the green economy develops. As green industries and professions 

240
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
mature, more regulations and certifications are likely to follow. Continue to 
track education and training requirements as you move into your career to 
ensure that your skills stay competitive. 
Discovering the key topics
As you focus on your target field, develop a list of the skills you need to per­
form on your job and the topics you need to understand to succeed. Be as 
thorough and detailed as possible as you create your list. 
As you prepare this list, your best sources of information include your notes 
from the informational interviews you’ve conducted with your contacts, 
research you’ve done online, and requirements you’ve gleaned from your 
professional association’s Web site. Use the following categories to organize 
your training list: 
	
✓	Industry knowledge: What do you need to know about the overall industry?
	
✓	Professional topics: What topics and skills are unique to your profession? 
	
✓	Sustainability issues: What do you need to know about sustainability in 
general and as applied to your career?
Review your growing list of training and education needs. Look for keywords 
that seem to define the information you must know to succeed in your 
chosen profession. You will rely on these keywords later in this chapter to 
perform online searches for informal and formal education opportunities. 
	
Although you may think you should be able to find a list of training topics online 
somewhere, most green professions aren’t developed enough to have a com­
pletely defined list of training objectives available to those entering the field. As 
various professions mature, these lists are likely to become more available.  
Establishing your must-have 
level of training
In addition to knowing what topics and skills you must gain in preparation for 
your green career, you must also determine the level of training you ought to 
obtain. For some industries and professions, the requirements will be fairly 
obvious. For others, you may need to do a bit of hunting to find the answer 
you are looking for.
Is it possible to train yourself through a collection of informal opportunities 
or are you required to earn a certification or a degree? As you evaluate this 
question, consider the following nuances as well. 

241
 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
	
✓	Is there one specific path to enter your chosen profession? Must you 
earn a specific certificate or degree or can you choose from several pos­
sible paths to reach your goal? 
	
✓	Does making a slight change to your career goal impact the amount of 
education you must obtain? Perhaps there’s a related profession that 
doesn’t have the intense training requirements.
	
✓	If you are in a related field already, what do you need to add to your pre­
vious education to make the leap to your new profession? 
	
Understanding the level of training you need to have to enter a green career is 
important. Before you jump to conclusions about whether you can handle the 
preparation, be sure to check the facts with several sources. Your first source 
may or may not have the story straight. 
Discovering What Works for You
Green training is available in a variety of formats. The format that works best 
for you depends on your personal style. By understanding how you prefer 
to develop your skills and knowledge, you can use your training time more 
effectively and productively.
	
Forcing yourself into a training modality that isn’t a good fit for you adds a lot 
of unnecessary stress to your life. In such a case, training is likely to take more 
time and effort. You’ll have to force yourself to study or work on projects that 
don’t feel right to you. You may not even develop as many skills as you might 
have with the right training system.  
Consider the following questions to gain insights about the kind of training 
format that’s going to be best for you: 
	
✓	Under what circumstances are you most likely to gain skills and knowl­
edge? While you were in school was there a particular kind of project or 
assignment you enjoyed most? On your first few jobs, what helped you 
become proficient at your work? When you want to increase your knowl­
edge about something on your own, how do you approach the topic? 
	
✓	What is your primary learning style? 
 
• Are you a visual learner? Do you gain information by reading about 
a topic, looking at illustrations or pictures, or taking notes?
 
• Are you a kinesthetic processor? Do you develop your skills through 
experience by doing a task, using trial and error, or practicing?
 
• Are you an auditory learner? Do you comprehend information best 
by listening to instructions, attending a lecture, or hearing some­
one describe what you need to do? 

242
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Where do you think, concentrate, and study most effectively? At 
home, at a public library, in a café, outside, at your office, or at school? 
	
✓	Where are you likely to learn best? 
 
• At a school with a live instructor
 
• Observing an instructor via video
 
• At home via a teleclass (a class by phone)
 
• At home via the Internet
 
• Through a self-paced course
 
• By video or DVD
 
• On-the-job
In addition to understanding how you gain knowledge and skills, take a look 
at how education is going to fit your lifestyle. What form of education is more 
likely to blend with your lifestyle?
	
✓	Full-time school
	
✓	One course a semester
	
✓	Evening or weekend classes
	
✓	Intensive courses that last three to five days
	
✓	Self-paced classes in a school setting
	
✓	Internet courses on your own schedule
	
✓	An internship or apprenticeship
	
✓	On-the-job training
	
✓	Mentoring from a successful individual in your field
	
Use what you’ve discovered about your own personal style to determine 
which training options are a good fit for you. If you must tackle an education 
program that’s not a perfect fit for your style, think through the kinds of sup­
port and structure you’ll need to be successful. Be honest and realistic.
Creating Your Training Plan
As you consider the topics you need to explore, the depth of training you need, 
and the style of education that works best for you, you are ready to prepare 
your plan. Your personal plan is going to depend on your immediate purpose.

 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
If you are still exploring your green career options, your immediate goal is 
to gain more insight about your target career. In addition, you want to con­
firm that your career direction is a good fit for you. During your preliminary 
training, you may discover a specific area of your field that you would like to 
study in more depth.
To achieve your goals, you may want to take a few courses, listen to some 
lectures, attend a conference, and read a few books. If you feel better with a 
plan in place, research your options and write out a specific plan to follow. If 
you prefer to develop your plan as opportunities present themselves, make a 
list of the topics and skills you want to focus on over the next six months and 
then take advantage of opportunities that align with your goal. 
If you’ve determined your target green career and you are confident about 
your decision, your training goal may be more specific. You may need to 
complete a certification program or get a degree to allow you to move into 
this new field. 
Regardless of your goal, use the remainder of this chapter to explore the 
range of informal and formal green education options that exist. You may 
find solutions you didn’t know existed or you may discover a combination of 
ideas that allows you to customize your training plan to meet your specific 
needs. 
Exploring Ways to Gain New Knowledge
Although established degree programs are beginning to take shape for some 
topics, they don’t exist yet for every topic. Depending on your target career 
goal, you may find you need to create your own training syllabus based on 
independent study and exploration. 
	
Although you may feel you have limited options due to your geographic loca­
tion, don’t despair. In the following list of training options you’ll find several 
online training solutions that are available to all. 
Taking in expert presentations
Hearing an expert speak about a pertinent topic can be a thrilling opportu­
nity. Not only do you gain solid information about an interesting topic, but 
you also get to experience the expert in person. 

244
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
Take an inventory of local organizations that offer presentations. You might 
find a particular bookstore has a regular schedule of book signings. Green or 
sustainability centers or environmental organizations may be another source 
of expert presentations. 
Don’t limit yourself just to in-person events. Look for virtual presentations in 
the form of teleclasses or webinars (Web seminar) as well. Your professional 
organization may offer this kind of event for their members who live through­
out the nation. 
You may also find interesting presentations on the following Web sites:
	
✓	Arnold Creek Productions (www.arnoldcreekproductions.com/
SustainabilityShorts.htm) offers a collection of short clips of 
speakers talking about sustainability topics. If you find a speaker you 
want to hear more from, search Google for additional presentations or 
publications. 
	
✓	GreenBiz (www.greenbiz.com) offers periodic webinars on a variety of 
topics. Enter webinar in the search field on the Web site. Then scroll to 
the bottom of the list of webinars for current offerings. 
	
✓	TED (www.ted.com), which stands for Technology, Education, and 
Design, is an organization that sponsors an invitation-only event where 
the world’s leading thinkers and doers come together to find and share 
inspiration. Use the list of keywords at www.ted.com/talks/tags to 
identify the videos you want to watch. Be prepared to be inspired!
When you find a source with interesting and relevant presentations, make 
note of it. Return periodically to check out their calendar or sign up for event 
announcements to ensure that you don’t miss an important presentation. 
Reading books 
It’s said that if you want to know more about a topic than the vast majority 
of the general public, read at least three best-selling books on the topic. By 
reading books by several different authors, you gain different perspectives 
on the same topic. 
First, do a thorough survey of the green topics collection at your local 
library. Whatever you can find at the library is one less book you have to 
buy. And don’t forget to check out the periodicals while you are there. 
Check out Amazon.com to determine which books in your field qualify as 
bestsellers. You may want to read several books on the overall topic of sus­
tainability and then three more books on your specific industry or profes­
sion. Use the keywords you discovered at the beginning of this chapter to 
bring targeted books to the top of your searches. 

245
 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
Read the books mindfully, making connections between issues addressed in 
each book. Use your favorite study tools to make sure that you retain the key 
points from each book. You might want to use a highlighter, take notes, or 
write a summary of each chapter as you work your way through the book.
If you have better comprehension when listening to someone read the book, 
watch for audio versions of your target books. Listening to a book in your car 
while commuting or on your iPod while walking the dog are great ways to use 
time efficiently.
	
Consider starting with a selection of these books about sustainability. With a 
strong foundation in the issues involved in sustainability, you’ll be able to see 
your own industry from a new perspective. 
	
✓	Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution — and How It 
Can Renew America by Thomas L. Friedman (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)
	
✓	Our Choice: A Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis by Al Gore (Rodale Books)
	
✓	Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things by William 
McDonough and Michael Braungart (North Point Press)
	
✓	Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution by Paul 
Hawken, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins (Back Bay Books)
	
✓	Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to 
Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage by Daniel Esty 
and Andrew Winston (Wiley)
	
✓	The Sustainable Enterprise Fieldbook: When It All Comes Together by 
Jeana Wirtenberg, William G. Russell, and David Lipsky (Editors) 
(Amacom)
Make an active effort to connect the dots between the various books you read. 
How does your industry approach sustainability? Are there any aspects of 
sustainability that are being missed within your industry? Any issues that are 
being handled more efficiently than in the mainstream? As you identify poten­
tial links between books, record them. You never know what will prompt you 
to have an idea that makes you attractive to a potential employer. 
Exploring online courses
Whether you want to take a single course or you want to earn a certification 
on a particular topic, online courses may provide you with new possibilities. 
Suddenly you don’t have to worry about where you live or what your work 
schedule is. You can take these courses in your pajamas or on vacation.
To deepen your understanding of sustainability, you may want to take a 
course that gives you a solid foundation in the terminology and philosophy 
of sustainability. 

246
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Sustainable Measures (www.sustainablemeasures.com) is a site 
with a variety of information and resources for communities moving 
toward sustainability. Although not necessarily geared toward the cor­
porate world, you can begin to understand the world of sustainability by 
reviewing the materials on this site. 
	
✓	Green Supply Chain (www.greensupplychain.org) provides online 
sustainability training for individuals, schools, businesses, and govern­
ments. You can sign up for an individual course or take a series of online 
courses to become certified by this globally known company. 
	
✓	Natural Steps (www.naturalstep.org/en/elearning) provides sev­
eral online sustainability courses based on the Natural Step Framework 
that has evolved over 20 years of experience. To gain an overview of the 
framework, review (www.naturalstep.org/our-approach).
You may also find online courses that are specific to your industry. Use the 
guidelines in the section “Locating Informal Opportunities That Match Your 
Needs” later in this chapter.
Attending conferences
As soon as you identify your target green industry, visit the industry associa­
tion Web site to determine the schedule for the annual conference. Whether 
you find that the conference has just passed or it’s coming up in the next few 
months, pore over the posted information you find. 
Review the agenda, read the theme of the conference, and notice the names 
of the speakers. This initial scan can provide you with valuable information 
about your industry that will serve as a foundation you can build on as you 
explore your target industry. 
If at all possible, make plans to attend your industry conference. If pre-
conference or post-conference training opportunities are listed, evaluate 
whether the additional expense will provide you with valuable training and 
networking opportunities. Scan the conference schedule and make note of 
the sessions you want to attend. Always note your top two preferences just 
in case your first session isn’t available or doesn’t meet your needs as closely 
as you thought it would. 
As you await the next conference, take the time to do some preliminary read­
ing about topics that are critical within the industry. With this foundation, 
you’ll make more sense of the conference sessions. If the sponsoring orga­
nization offers any telephone previews of the conference, sign up to get an 
overview of the conference. 

247
 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
During the conference take advantage of any and all networking opportunities. 
Visit the exhibit hall to meet the exhibitors and understand their businesses 
and offerings. You may discover surprisingly helpful clues about your target 
industry. Meals, breaks, and receptions can be wonderful opportunities to 
meet other attendees as well. 
As you attend the keynotes and breakout sessions, take comprehensive notes 
even if you don’t completely understand what’s being said. Each talk is likely 
to help you fill in blanks from previous presentations. You never know how 
you’ll fill in the gaps. You may find clarifying clues months later as you read a 
book or talk with one of your contacts. 
Enrolling in classes
If you want to take a class in person, check your local adult education system, 
the community college, or sustainability organizations in your area. It’s likely 
you’ll be able to search for these classes online. Rely on your collection of 
keywords to identify classes that match your interests. Refer to the section 
“Locating Informal Opportunities That Match Your Needs” later in this chapter 
for more detailed information about how to locate classes like this.
Another benefit of taking individuals courses is that you can explore a topic 
of interest without having to sign on for a full degree or certificate program. 
In fact, taking a course or two can be a great opportunity to confirm that you 
want to commit to a full program. 
Becoming certified
In some professions your measure of success includes the certifications and 
licenses you hold in your field. To determine whether you need to earn a cer­
tification for your chosen field, refer to your professional association, trade 
association, or the training institute for your profession. You might also do 
a keyword search “keyword(s)” + certification or “keyword(s)” + license to 
find articles or blogs about relevant requirements within your field. 
Keep in mind that some certifications are for established professionals to 
gain more credibility and to demonstrate their expertise. Depending on your 
field, it may take a few years to earn such a certification. In other fields you 
must be certified or licensed to do the work without supervision. You’ll need 
to ascertain the facts surrounding your profession’s requirements. 
The following list of licenses and certifications is just a sampling of the pro­
grams available to professionals and trades people:

248
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Certified Environmental Auditor (www.beac.org): The professionals 
with this designation evaluate industry operations to determine environ­
mental impacts and compliance issues.
	
✓	Certified Water Treatment Plant Operator (www.abccert.org): Those 
working as operators, analysts, and technologists in the water treat­
ment industry can participate in this voluntary certification program to 
enhance their career and demonstrate their competence.
	
✓	EcoBroker (www.ecobroker.com/eb): Real estate professionals who 
complete a specific training program earn the EcoBroker designation 
and help their clients make more energy-efficient and environmentally 
sound decisions about their property. 
	
✓	Electrician: Contact your state to find out more about this licensing 
program. 
	
✓	Greenhouse Gas Accounting and Management (www.ghginsititute.
com): The Greenhouse Gas Management Institute provides several cer­
tificates for those who complete one or more courses in greenhouse 
gas accounting and management, trading markets, offset projects, and 
verification.
	
✓	LEED-AP (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) (www.
gbci.org): This prestigious certification is for building professionals 
who have a thorough and current understanding of green building prac­
tices. Several LEED AP designations are available. 
	
✓	Professional Engineer (www.nspe.org/Licensure): This license is 
obtained to demonstrate one’s competence in the field of engineering, 
whether in civil, electrical, mechanical, or chemical engineering. 
	
Be aware that certification and licensing standards may evolve as the green 
economy takes hold. Keep in touch with your professional association for the 
latest news on this topic. If new certifications are required, the association 
may have a grandfather clause that allows current professionals to obtain the 
certification without meeting all the requirements. If you have this opportu­
nity, jump on it without delay.  
Earning a degree
If you are entering a completely new field or wanting to enhance your skills in 
your current field dramatically, you may find the most efficient way is to earn 
some sort of degree in it. Your target profession and where you are in your 
career are likely to dictate the educational path you choose. 

249
 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
	
✓	Community college: At your local community college you may find an 
environmentally friendly program that fits your interests. It’s likely you’ll 
be able to earn an Associates in Arts or Sciences or a certificate based 
on the number of courses you complete. If you already have a college 
degree, you’d most likely focus on earning a certificate in a particular 
topic area rather than a full Associates degree.
	
✓	College or university: If you want to take your education to the next 
level, consider an undergraduate or graduate degree in your chosen 
field. Review the list of degrees at your local university or expand your 
territory and search for the program that matches your goals. 
	
✓	Masters in Business Administration (MBA): A number of MBA programs 
are springing up around the country that have a special emphasis on 
sustainable, green, or corporate socially responsible philosophies. Many 
schools offer a mix of programs to meet the needs of full-time students, 
part-time students, and executives. A few programs even offer a com­
pletely virtual experience. To evaluate whether various MBA programs 
meet your needs, refer to Net Impact’s Business as UNusual publication 
(www.netimpact.org and click on Resources and then Publications) 
and the Aspen Institute’s Beyond Grey Pinstripes report (www.beyond
greypinstripes.org). 
Locating Informal Opportunities 
That Match Your Needs
A combination of courses, presentations, videos, and conferences can pro­
vide you with a rich, multi-faceted understanding of your field of choice. 
The key to staying focused in this approach is knowing exactly what you are 
trying to achieve with your exploration. 
	
✓	Create your own educational path. In some cases, the best way to 
develop your skills and your knowledge is to create your own training 
program. Think about what you want to achieve and then build your 
own syllabus to reach those goals. Tap into a variety of informal training 
opportunities to develop your knowledge and your skills. Give yourself a 
bit of room to evolve your plan as you discover more about the field. 
	
✓	Fill in key gaps in your resume. Talk to your contacts to determine the 
kind of courses, conferences, or reading you must do to prepare you for 
your target career. 

250
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Test out a potential career before taking the dive into a formal degree. 
Before investing the time, effort, and money to apply to a university for 
a degree, take some time to confirm that the field is what you think it 
is and that you enjoy exploring it. If the course of study isn’t matching 
your expectations, it’s much easier to make a course correction when 
you enrolled in a class or two than when you have been accepted into a 
four-year program. 
After identifying what you want to achieve, your next task is to identify infor­
mal training opportunities that match your interests and occur in your region 
or are available online. Use the following keyword strings in your favorite 
search engine to pull up a wide variety of opportunities. Note: Replace “your 
region” with online to discover online training opportunities. 
	
✓	“keyword(s)” + training + “your region” 
	
✓	“keyword(s)” + course + “your region” 
	
✓	“keyword(s)” + conference + “your region”
As you begin to find opportunities, create a list of Web sites and organiza­
tions you want to study in more depth. Bookmark the pages of interest so 
you can return to them when you have the time to review them. You may find 
it helpful to begin to categorize your finds in some manner. Unless you see 
an opportunity for tonight or this weekend, give yourself a chance to survey 
the territory before you plunk down your credit card to register. Although it 
may feel like you’ve hit a vein of gold, no one is going to take these opportuni­
ties away from you. You have plenty of time to sift through your options and 
make the best decisions for your short- and long-term future. 
 Searching for Formal Education Options 
There is a wide range of educational opportunities in the green space. To 
avoid being overwhelmed, define what you’re looking for before you begin 
your search. 
	
✓	What level of education is required to succeed in your chosen field? 
Based on what you’ve discovered through your research and your con­
versations with your contacts, are you looking for a certificate, an under­
graduate degree, or a graduate degree? 
	
✓	What area do you want to study? Identify the keywords that are likely 
to describe the kind of program you want to attend. Each school may 
have a slightly different name for their program. In fact, the programs 
you are interested in may be found in different departments at different 
schools. Visit several school Web sites before you decide which key­
words to use in your search.

251
 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
	
✓	What geographic area are you willing to consider? Although you may 
be tempted to focus on educational options in your immediate area, 
keep your options open as you begin to search for opportunities. With 
distance-learning options, extension programs, and courses designed for 
working adults, it’s possible you could find a way to attend a school that 
is outside of your immediate area. 
	
✓	How much can you spend on your education? Before you close the 
door on your education, take a good look at your financial options. If 
you need some help identifying your options, look at this Web page that 
describes a variety of funding options for nontraditional students (www.
freschinfo.com/strategy-nontrad.php).
Identifying potential degree programs
Start by creating a list of all the programs you know about. Don’t worry 
if they’re out of your area or feel beyond your reach financially. You can 
narrow down your list after you get a sense of the programs that exist.
Begin by reviewing your notes from your initial research of your target field. 
Remind yourself what your contacts shared about training for the field. 
Review the professional association’s Web site one more time for clues. Add 
any institutions or programs you discover to your master list. 
Then do a keyword search to find programs that you may not be aware of. 
Use the following keyword configurations to identify programs. Replace 
“keyword(s)” with the keywords that describe your target area of study. 
	
✓	“keyword(s)” + education
	
✓	“keyword(s)” + degree 
	
✓	“keyword(s)” + certificate 
To limit these searches to a specific region, add another term to these search 
strings: “keyword(s)” + education + “your region.” Replace the word educa­
tion with degree or certification to pull up additional options. 
If you’d like to explore your online training options, use this search string: 
“keyword(s)” + education + online. Remember, you can replace the word 
education with degree or certification. 
Don’t make any decisions on the fly. Just take all your results and add each 
program you find to your master list. Include a Web address so you can 
return later to study the program more thoroughly. 

252
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
If you’re having a hard time finding an education program, reach out to your 
contacts or professional association again. Be specific in your request for 
information about educational or training programs that would prepare you 
for your field of interest. It’s also possible that there are no programs in your 
career area yet. If you are at the cutting edge of your field, you may be ahead 
of even the educational organizations. If this is the case, return to the section 
“Locating Informal Opportunities That Match Your Needs” for information 
about searching out courses, conferences, and presentations. 
Evaluating degree programs
Depending on the number of schools you’re considering, selecting the best 
program out of the list may be an overwhelming process. Between the 
amount of information you receive and the number of possibilities you are 
trying on, your mind may spin in all sorts of directions trying to figure out a 
workable plan of action. 
Take your evaluation one step at a time. Use the following step-by-step pro­
cess to stay focused as you move forward:
	
1.	Get an overview of each program. When you have a collection of pos­
sible programs, read over the material in detail to get a sense of each 
one. Pay attention to the program description while taking note of any 
special features that are particularly relevant to your target career. Keep 
track of the faculty research interests as well. This information is impor­
tant because most faculty members prefer to guide students who have 
interests similar to their own, so if you expect to do research as part of 
your degree program, make sure that their research is relevant to your 
goals. Double-check that the program prepares you for any additional 
licenses or certifications you may need. 
	
2.	Compare and contrast the various programs. Each school is likely to 
use a slightly different format to describe its program, so you may want 
to make a chart for each program to keep the details straight. Determine 
what you want to know about each program and then fill in the details. 
Don’t be surprised if your chart has some blanks. You can fill in those 
answers in Step 4. 
	
3.	Get a sense of which programs interest you most. Tune in to your 
intuition as you study each program. Your sense of excitement, or lack 
thereof, is a clue worth paying attention to. Make note of what appeals 
to you about your top picks. 

253
 Chapter 16: Advancing Your Green Education
	
4.	Check out interesting programs. If you are considering a traditional school, 
visit the school in person if at all possible. Call ahead to make an appoint­
ment to meet with a professor or an admissions counselor. Ask to talk with 
current students. See whether you can sit in on a class. Prepare questions 
ahead of time based on the blanks in your detailed spreadsheet. This is a 
good time to ask about prerequisites and any anticipated faculty changes.
	
	 If you are considering a distance learning format and haven’t taken an 
online course before, take a single course through the school to see 
what it’s like before you commit to an entire program. 
	
5.	Apply to your top choices. Leave yourself enough time to complete each 
application with thought and care. For any required recommendations, 
choose people who have some clout in your target field or a related field. 
The people you ask should also know your talents and abilities, have a 
sense of your ability to complete an education program, and be able to 
affirm your character. Create a packet for each reference that includes a 
description of what each school wants, including any forms they must fill 
out, a copy of your professional resume, a list of courses you’ve taken with 
them, a list of projects you’ve worked on with them, a list of extracurricular 
activities that you’ve participated in (such as professional association mem­
berships, volunteer activities, related course work, and leadership roles), 
and an explanation of why you are applying to the program. Be sure to 
thank your references and keep them informed of your progress. 
	
Applying for a degree program, whether undergraduate or graduate, can be 
stressful. Reach out to others who have been through the process to help 
you through the maze. Having a mentor during the application process can 
make quite a difference. In addition to helping you understand the steps, your 
mentor may be willing to read over your essays and coach you to develop 
your vision statement.
Finding Creative Ways to Fit 
Education into Your Life
Making the commitment to take classes or earn a degree is a significant deci­
sion. To ensure your success, take some time to figure out the best way to 
integrate your education into your lifestyle:
	
✓	Adjusting your priorities: With school entering the picture, your life 
may change form. Make a list of your three top priorities. By being clear 
about your new priorities, you can make decisions in alignment with 
your current reality. 

254
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
	
✓	Giving your friends, family members, and coworkers a heads-up: Tell 
the people in your life that you may not be as available as you have been 
and why. If you take care of this in an upfront manner, you’re less likely 
to offend people who don’t understand why you’ve pulled back or disap­
peared. Warn those you love when midterms and finals roll around. 
	
✓	Setting aside time to study: Create a system to stay on top of your 
schoolwork. Keep up with reading assignments and begin thinking about 
projects as soon as they are assigned. You are investing too much time, 
money, and effort to shortchange your education by cramming before 
tests and rushing to finish projects. 
	
✓	Finding new ways to get things done at home and at work: Simplify 
wherever possible. For example, if doing your hair takes you a half-
hour each morning, get it cut in a way that takes you only five minutes. 
Eliminate tasks or delegate what you can by finding someone else who 
can accomplish the task. 
	
Talk with friends and contacts who are currently in school or recently gradu­
ated. Ask them what strategies they use to maintain a reasonable balance in 
their life. They may also have tips to help you get acclimated as you settle into 
your new reality.

ou know what you want to do, but now you have to figure out the best 
way to communicate your value to your contacts, interviewers, recruit­
ers, and hiring managers. This chapter helps you articulate your unique com­
petitive advantage, create a strong resume, and develop your credibility. 
If you feel a bit queasy at the thought of figuring this out, you are not alone. 
Everyone feels that way. It’s not easy to take a microscope to your work his­
tory and your life to figure out which pieces and parts of it are unique. 
	
The clearer you are about your desired goal, the easier you’ll work through 
this chapter. If you’re a bit fuzzy about what you bring to your job search in 
terms of talents, skills, experience, and knowledge, take a look at Chapters 
4 through 6 before you attempt to articulate the value you bring to an open 
position. If you know what you want to do, but you haven’t identified what 
green industry will allow you to use your skills, take a gander at Chapter 14.
Identifying Why a Company Should 
Hire You and Not Someone Else
As a job seeker, you are just one voice in a crowded room. The challenge 
is to figure out, before you begin your active job search, how are you going 
to stand out and be noticed. Taking the time to create this clarity step by 
step pays off as you launch your job search with confidence that will shine 
through to everyone you talk to.

256
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
Leveraging your unique background
Instead of slipping into the trap of thinking you are just like everyone else 
applying for your desired green position, give deep consideration to your 
unique background. How does your education, passion, work experience, 
service activities, and personality set you apart? 
If you want some help bringing your unique qualities into focus, review 
Chapters 4 through 6 to remind yourself of your skills and interests, the 
processes you enjoy, and the problems you are able to solve. 
Even if you think your individual accomplishments aren’t anything to write 
home about, think about how your experiences combine to create the whole 
picture. Perhaps you’ve had two or three jobs that can be woven together to 
give you a unique point of view and an unusual set of skills.
	
Adam has discovered that all the clues he’s collecting are pointing in one 
direction: planning large green conferences and trade shows. As he scans 
his work history, he realizes that his marketing work for a large company 
has given him valuable experience as an exhibitor. On occasion, he’s also 
volunteered through his professional association to help organize parts of its 
annual conference. Working for a caterer in college gave him a unique per­
spective on the food services aspect of large events. His jobs selling adver­
tising space in both the yearbook and for a large radio show station gave 
him the sales skills he’ll need to pull off large events. He’s amazed that his 
seemingly unrelated jobs are lining up to provide a very strong collection of 
experiences for his desired work — but he has some gaps in his background. 
With this insight he can take a few courses and take on a couple of volunteer 
positions to round out his background before he launches his job search.
It’s unlikely that your unique competitive advantage is going to spring into 
your mind out of the blue. It’s likely that you’ll need to talk with people in the 
field, do in-depth research on your profession, and take time to mine your 
own history. As the pieces fall into place, reflect on the best way to position 
yourself as a distinct asset for the company.
	
If you aren’t coming up with any brilliant insights about your own uniqueness, 
don’t be alarmed. People often assume that they aren’t that special — that 
everyone can do the things they’re good at. It’s likely you are so close to 
your own strengths (you live with them all day every day after all), that you 
can’t make an objective assessment of where you shine. Turn to your family, 
friends, and colleagues and ask them what sets you apart from others in your 
field. It’s likely that they’ll be able to give you a quick answer because they see 
these qualities in you all the time. 
	
If you’re changing from one field or profession to another, you have an even 
bigger mountain to climb. Not only must you convince the hiring manager that 
you’re a qualified candidate, you must also demonstrate how your unusual back­
ground is an advantage to the company. To succeed, you must know the green

industry and the company and be able to point out why your experiences with a 
particular customer base, product, or distribution system give you a unique per­
spective on their core business. If you’ve thought this through in advance, you 
can share a few key points in your cover letter, and then eventually in your inter­
view, that prove your point. The key is to match your strengths to their needs.
Naming your impact on a 
company’s bottom line
In addition to describing how you are uniquely qualified for your target posi­
tion, you must be able to articulate how your talents and services make a dif­
ference to the company’s bottom line. After all, that’s the question the hiring 
manager is asking: Are you going to be an asset to the business?
Review your work history to find ways your actions have contributed to 
your employers’ bottom line. Quantify your contributions and tie them to 
the bottom line as much as possible. If you don’t have precise numbers, it’s 
acceptable to provide an approximate number. Just make sure that your ref­
erences agree with your assessment of your work.
	
✓	Do you increase the company’s income? 
 
• If you’re in sales, review your sales numbers for impressive evi­
dence in terms of the number of sales you’ve made, the size of 
your sales, or your close rate. 
 
• If you’re in marketing, you might look to the effectiveness of your 
marketing campaign and how the campaign translated into dollars 
for your company.
 
• If you’re in product development, look to the value of the product 
you designed. How much money did that product eventually bring 
your employer?
	
✓	Do you save the company money?
 
• If you’re in quality assurance, estimate how much money you saved 
the company by fixing errors before the product was released.
 
• If you’re a buyer, demonstrate how you cut the cost of key materi­
als and parts for the company. 
 
• If you’re in customer service, estimate how much you’ve saved the 
company by reducing customer complaints.
	
If you aren’t accustomed to thinking about your role as one that impacts your 
company’s bottom line, you may need to spend some time working through 
this section. Reach out to others in your field to see how they articulated their 
value on their resume. You may also want to work with a career counselor or 
resume writers to develop this information. 

258
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
Communicating Your Value Clearly
Knowing how you contribute to the bottom line is critical to your job search. 
Knowing how to communicate your value is even more essential. At every step 
of your job search you must be able to convey your value in person (informa­
tional interviews, networking, interviewing) and in writing (cover letter, resume, 
online portfolio). The sooner you pin down the most effective way to verbalize 
your target position and your value, the more successful your job search will be.
In many situations your description of what you’re looking for is the first 
information your contacts, hiring managers, interviewers, and recruiters 
have about you. It’s important that this statement is clear, concise, and 
compelling so you get noticed and get invited in for an interview. 
	
If you are unsure of your career direction, be mindful of how you introduce 
yourself. Remember, even if you aren’t actively looking for a job, your network 
is building an impression of you. See Chapter 14 for important information 
about how to present yourself when you aren’t yet clear of your direction. 
Creating a powerful summary statement
Spend time developing your summary statement before you send out your 
first resume. Your summary statement should be at the top of your resume 
under your contact information and should tell hiring managers, interview­
ers, and recruiters exactly who you are, what you’ve accomplished, and what 
you bring to the position. Your statement must engage them immediately 
with its clarity, focus, and power.
If you’re researching on the Web, you may find conflicting information about 
this topic. Here are some examples of what to do and what not to do:
	
✓	Useless: No introductory statement at all
	
✓	Essentially useless: Job title: Commercial Solar Sales
	
✓	Next to useless: 
 
• Objective: Obtain a position at ABC Solar where I can use my sales 
skills.
 
• Objective: To secure a position with large solar company for a 
long-lasting position in sales.
	
✓	Much better: Dynamic Commercial Solar Sales professional with exten­
sive experience selling large-scale solar power installations to compa­
nies with multiple locations. Experienced in all phases of the solar sales 
process, from commercial prospect identification and qualification to 

259
 Chapter 17: Claiming Your Competitive Advantage
signed contract, with consistent post-installation follow-up to identify 
additional opportunities. Collaborated with finance experts and design 
engineers to create custom large-scale solar power systems to achieve 
customers’ unique goals. 
	
✓	Best: Start with the previous paragraph at the top of your resume and 
add the following section with a bulleted list of expertise areas: 
	
	Expertise includes:
 
• Financing options including purchase power agreements
 
• Government and utility rebates and tax credits
 
• Utility certifications
 
• Commercial solar rules and regulations 
As you can see, it’s important to get your summary statement right. Your first 
draft of your summary statement isn’t going to be your final product. Don’t 
expect it to be. Begin by jotting down notes about your competitive advan­
tage. Be sure to include your target position and why you are well suited for 
the position. 
Keep refining your statement until you feel comfortable with it. Then test 
your draft in casual conversation with colleagues and your networking con­
tacts. If they give you a blank stare or tilt their head in confusion, you know 
you have more work to do. If their eyes light up and they begin giving you 
stellar referrals and resources or asking you relevant questions about your 
goals, you know you are on to something. If you feel comfortable doing so, 
ask your contacts if they have suggestions or ideas to make your statement 
even stronger. When people understand what you want, they’ll be able to 
help you much more effectively.
	
As soon as you nail down your summary statement for your resume, you can use 
a variation of it as your 30-second introduction at networking events, your initial 
lead-in as you begin a conversation with a contact, your cover letter introduc­
tion, and your answer to the tell-me-about-yourself question during an interview. 
Keep in mind that you need to update your summary statement as you iden­
tify specific job openings. 
Developing persuasive accomplishments
The next important component of your resume consists of your accomplish­
ments in each of your previous positions. To be effective, accomplishment 
statements must quantify your results in some way, whether it’s how much 

260
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
money you made, the number of people you managed, the size of your 
budget, or how many patents you’ve worked on.
Notice how the numbers increase the value of the following accomplishment 
statements. 
	
✓	“Managed a team” versus “Managed 100-person team during product 
launch due to unexpected departure of other manager.”
	
✓	“Planned association’s annual conference” versus “Planned 3-day annual 
association conference for 2,000 attendees with 50 exhibitors, com­
pleted project 8% under budget, and diverted 98% of waste generated.”
	
✓	“Cut customer complaints” versus “Achieved 70% reduction in customer 
complaints through implementation of quality control measures.”
	
Don’t lose the result at the end of the statement — lead the bullet with the 
quantified result. Why? People read from left to right. Putting the number as 
close as possible to the left-hand margin is more likely to attract attention.
Before you even begin writing your resume for your target job, focus your 
efforts on building a database of accomplishments from all your previous 
jobs. Set a goal to write at least three accomplishments for each position. 
Don’t worry about quantifying the statements as you are drafting your 
accomplishments. You can add in the numbers on your second pass if that’s 
easier for you.
	
The key is to articulate how your actions boost the company’s bottom line 
and minimize the company’s impact on the environment. 
When you have your complete database of accomplishments, you’re ready 
to develop a customized resume for a specific position. Begin by pulling out 
the accomplishments that align with the responsibilities and tasks associated 
with your target position. If you don’t have a clear sense of the target posi­
tion, search for a representative job description online. Your goal is to use 
your accomplishments to demonstrate that you are a perfect fit for the job.
Highlighting your commitment 
to sustainability
Green, sustainable companies want to hire people who share their perspec­
tive. To communicate your commitment to the environment and social 
responsibility you must develop your resume accordingly.
	
✓	Look to your past jobs for evidence that you made a system more effi­
cient, helped a company use less energy, or found ways to eliminate 
excess waste.

261
 Chapter 17: Claiming Your Competitive Advantage
	
✓	Review your list of volunteer and service activities to find examples of 
ways you contributed to the environment or socially responsible causes.
	
✓	Highlight any leadership roles you’ve had. In the green economy every­
one must have leadership capabilities to champion green efforts within 
the company and beyond. 
	
✓	Make note of any classes you’ve taken to enhance your green expertise. 
	
✓	List certificates, designations, or degrees you’ve earned in the process 
of greening your education.
	
✓	Assess whether your efforts to green your personal life are relevant to 
landing your target job. If you are moving into the solar industry, the 
fact that you’ve installed solar on your own home and your neighbor’s 
house may earn you some points. If you want to work in the field of wild­
life conservation, your dedicated efforts to relocate the family of rac­
coons that took up residence under your deck may prove to be a useful 
story to illustrate your commitment to wildlife. 
Be prepared to describe your green, sustainable, socially responsible efforts in 
detail during your interviews. Although telling your stories may be entertain­
ing, your primary goal here isn’t to entertain but to persuade. Avoid describing 
every twist and turn of your story to make your point. Taking time to develop 
effective ways to describe your experiences concisely can make all the differ­
ence when it comes to making a positive impression in your interviews.
Incorporating relevant key words
Whether your resume is going to be reviewed by a person or scanned by a com­
puter, you want to make sure that the language you use will grab their attention:
	
✓	Computer scanners are programmed to search for specific words. If 
your resume doesn’t have those words, you won’t get past that com­
puter gatekeeper. 
	
✓	Recruiters/interviewers need keywords because they are scanning 
many, many resumes in a sitting, trying to find the candidates that make 
the first cut. They literally scan each resume to find evidence that the 
resume is worth examining in more detail. If they don’t see the words 
they are looking for, they too will toss your resume into the circular file. 
	
If you use terminology from your old industry or terms you’ve created to 
describe what you do, you won’t gain the attention you are searching for. To 
succeed, you must get inside of the head of the person programming the com­
puter scanner or the person doing the scanning. It’s your job to research and 
discern what they’re looking for and how they’ll find it. 
To decide what keywords you need to incorporate into your resume, scan the 
job description if it is available. If you don’t have a job description, search for a 

262
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
relevant job description or job listing online. Or do a search on LinkedIn to find 
people who have a similar job. Read these descriptions with an eye on the key 
terms. Then review all the descriptions to see which words repeat. Those are 
the words you definitely want to incorporate into your resume. 
	
You need to have the right keywords in your resume each time you restruc­
ture it for a different job opening. 
Preparing Your Resume for Prime Time
As soon as you’re comfortable with the content of your resume, it’s time to 
turn your attention to the format. Generally speaking, your resume should be 
formatted to highlight your key points with consistent spacing, bolding, bul­
lets, and sufficient white space. I say generally speaking because you actually 
need to create several versions of your resume to be prepared for requests in 
various situations.
	
✓	Creating a resume to hand to your contacts: Always have a hard copy 
of your resume ready when you meet with a contact or attend an inter­
view. This version of your resume must be printed on high-quality 
recycled paper with tasteful formatting that helps the reader scan the 
resume for key points. 
	
✓	Providing a resume via e-mail: If your contact can accept attachments, 
create a PDF of your resume before sending the document to ensure that 
the formatting remains the way you want it. You can find free PDF con­
verters online with a quick Web search. If your contact cannot accept 
attachments, you’ll need to create a text version of your resume that will 
look good when your contact opens your e-mail.
	
✓	Formatting the text version of your resume: Your text resume should have 
little or no formatting — just simple line breaks, spaces, and headings. To 
convert your resume into text, copy the contents of your Word document 
into a text editor. (E-mail programs usually work as text editors — or if you 
use Windows, you can find Notepad or WordPad under Accessories in your 
list of programs.) The text editor strips out the formatting and leaves you 
with plain text that you can drop in an e-mail. Play around with the format­
ting until the headings are clear and spacing indicates the sections of your 
resume. Send your resume to yourself and a few friends to make sure it 
looks as good on the receiving end as it did when you clicked Send.
	
✓	Designing an online portfolio: If you have a specific skill you want to 
highlight, such as your design skills or technical expertise, you may want 
to consider creating an online portfolio. Check out www.mycareerhigh
lights.com for sample portfolios. When you have your site set up, 
create links from your social networking profiles (LinkedIn, Facebook, 
Twitter) to your online portfolio. 

263
 Chapter 17: Claiming Your Competitive Advantage
For more guidance on resumes, refer to Resumes for Dummies by Joyce Lain 
Kennedy (Wiley) for the latest tips, sample resumes, and helpful hints.
	
Invest as much time as you can creating the best resume you can, but don’t 
use your resume preparation as a reason to avoid your other job search activi­
ties. Although it is important to create a well-conceived, typo-free resume, 
don’t get so hooked on perfection that you never hand it out! 
Demonstrating Your Expertise
Another way to gain recognition and become known is to create your own 
content-rich watering hole where people gather to discuss your favorite 
topic. Although this strategy takes some time and determination to create, 
the payoffs may be worth the effort in your particular field. Not only do you 
gain exposure, build name recognition, demonstrate your knowledge, and 
create a living portfolio of your writing, you also become known as an expert 
in your field. 
Creating your own blog
A popular strategy these days is to build a blog with well-researched, well-
written articles about topics related to your target industry. Keep your focus 
on all angles of your target topic to create keyword-rich posts that keep the 
search engines coming back for more great content. 
Building your own blog isn’t hard. The key is to choose the blogging platform 
that fits your experience level. Here’s a comparison of three common blog­
ging systems: www.bloggingbasics101.com/2009/01/choosing-a-
blogging-platform. And those systems are
	
✓	Blogger (www.blogger.com): Known as one of the easiest blogging sys­
tems to set up. Some may question the professionalism of many Blogger 
blogs.
	
✓	Typepad (www.typepad.com): For a reasonable monthly fee you can 
create a very professional-looking blog that’s easy to use. The intuitive 
interface allows you to get started right away with the help of design 
templates. 
	
✓	Wordpress (www.wordpress.com): Wordpress has a less intuitive 
interface, with lots of power in terms of add-ons and customizability. 
Also you need to find a host to house your blog. If you are comfortable 
with HTML coding and CSS stylesheets, you may want to consider this 
option.

264
Part IV: Using Green Job Search 2.0 Techniques 
Before you begin writing and posting random missives, take some time to 
define your purpose for creating the blog. Determine your primary topic 
and the scope of your blog. What is your mission? Do you want to explain 
a complex topic to general readers? Do you want to share the inside scoop 
on your target industry? Do you want to report on innovations in your field? 
Whatever you choose, stick with it. A hodgepodge of articles doesn’t make 
the impression you are trying to create. 
	
Whether you want to set up your own blog or not, begin commenting on the 
blogs that are well known in your network right now. You can build name rec­
ognition within your field relatively quickly by being known as the commenter 
with astute insights, detailed knowledge, and a contributing spirit. Don’t be a 
know-it-all; be the expert everyone wants on their team. 
Distributing your knowledge
If the blog format isn’t for you, here are a few more ways you can build your 
credibility online. 
	
✓	If you enjoy writing, consider developing a collection of articles on your 
topic. Then use an article submission system like www.submityour
article.com to distribute your articles far and wide. This strategy is 
a viable way to build traffic to your blog or Web site as well. 
	
✓	If you’d prefer to share your expertise by answering questions, consider 
becoming an expert on www.allexperts.com. Scan the array of cat­
egories to see where your expertise may fit. If you don’t see the right 
topic, you can request that the topic be added to the site. 
	
✓	If you like to tweet, build a Twitter account (www.twitter.com) with 
a professional background and profile. Tweet specifically on the topic 
you want to be known for. Set up TweetDeck (www.tweetdeck.com) to 
search for others who tweet about your desired topic. Begin to follow 
them, and before you know it you’ll be part of the in-group. 
Filming yourself in action
Images often speak louder than words. Consider sharing videos highlighting 
your talents, knowledge, and skills for others to see. Choose your topics and 
presentation style to match the industry you want to enter. 

265
 Chapter 17: Claiming Your Competitive Advantage
	
✓	YouTube: To prepare, register with YouTube (www.youtube.com) and 
create your own video channel. As you fill out your profile and set up 
your page, keep your purpose in mind. If you’re highlighting information, 
remember to set yourself up as a guru. To build traffic to your video 
channel, designate your favorite videos and connect with friends within 
YouTube. Making a video is fairly straightforward. Start with your com­
puter camera or a simple camera like the Flip camera (www.theflip.
com). Depending on your goals, you may want to interview experts, dem­
onstrate a skill, or create a slideshow with narration.
	
✓	LinkedIn: If video production is more than you want to take on, con­
sider adding a slide presentation to your LinkedIn profile. To post your 
presentation to your profile, go to Edit Profile and scroll down until you 
find the Featured Application area. Click See All Applications and look 
for Google Presentations or SlideShare in the list of applications.
	
Regardless of where you post your productions, you need to spread the word 
to get noticed. Include a reference to your YouTube channel or LinkedIn 
Presentation in your e-mail signature, in your social networking profiles, and 
on your announcements whenever you create a new piece.

Activating Your 
Green Job Search

In this part . . .
A
fter setting the stage for your green job search, it’s 
time to take action! In this part you develop strate­
gies to identify target companies that fit your career goal 
and job openings that match your talents. In addition, you 
discover strategies you can use in your new green job to 
prepare you for your next career step.

Chapter 18
Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly 
Companies
In This Chapter
▶	Deciding why you are researching companies
▶	Creating a list of green companies
▶	Figuring out the best way to gather information about green companies
▶	Exploring your favorite green companies in more depth
O
ne of the challenges of the new green economy is figuring out which 
companies in your area are green and sustainable. Although this is a 
somewhat useful question when you’re exploring your green career options, 
it becomes even more critical when you’re searching for a local job opening.
In this chapter you discover how to identify potential companies that match 
your criteria and how to determine what role you can play in helping them 
meet challenges and grow.
	
When I use the word companies in this chapter (and the rest of the book), I’m 
referring to any kind of organization you might want to work for. You might 
see yourself working for a public or private company or you might prefer to 
work for a government agency, nonprofit, educational institution, small busi­
ness, or consulting firm. Although green job opportunities are available in all 
these settings, it would be confusing to try to refer to every single one of these 
options repeatedly throughout the text.
Identifying Your Immediate Goal
You may think there’s no need to research green companies unless, or until, 
you have an active job search underway. If you do wait, you may miss out 
on a great source of information about your future green career. Discovering 
which companies are thriving in your industry provides you with important 
insights about the direction of your industry and your profession. 

270
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
Think about your immediate goals:
	
✓	If you’re in the process of exploring a possible career direction, keep 
your company search geographically broad. By casting a wide net you 
identify more relevant companies. Glean as much information as you 
can by studying the companies’ Web sites and other discussions of them 
online. This initial research enables you to uncover important clues 
about the kind of technology the industry uses, the associations com­
panies belong to, the vendors they work with, and the customers they 
service. You can then use those clues to further your research.
	
✓	If you’re in an active job search, your requirements for a green company 
become much more specific. You want a company within a certain com­
mute, with a certain culture, working toward a specific purpose and — 
oh, yes — with a job opening! Although you may be tempted to focus all 
your attention on companies with active job openings, don’t limit your­
self. Keep your overall focus on the companies that are a great fit for 
you and your skills. With a detailed list of targeted companies in hand, 
you can leverage your networking connections and create a campaign to 
get in the door.
	
Most job openings aren’t advertised or listed. The job you want may be open, 
but if you’re only targeting companies with listed job openings you may miss 
the opportunity to apply for that job. To find out which companies have unad­
vertised jobs, you must tap into the knowledge of your network.  
	
One sure-fire way to derail your quest for a green career is to narrow your 
focus too soon to only the green companies in your local area. Whether you’re 
in full job search mode or not, take some time to understand the entire indus­
try and its possibilities and trends before you start your local search. With a 
larger pool of companies to consider in the early stages of your job search, 
you have a better chance of seeing where your skills fit into the industry. 
Furthermore, your thorough understanding of the entire industry makes it 
easier for you to differentiate yourself from other job candidates in the inter­
view process. 
Clarifying the Focus of Your Search
One of my colleagues has a saying at the end of her e-mails: “If you don’t 
know what you are looking for it is really hard to find it!” This is especially 
true when it comes to identifying green companies. Although you may be 
lucky enough to run across a list of the top 150 solar companies or a map of 
wind manufacturers, many industries don’t come with a preexisting list of 
companies to choose from. Instead you must employ some detective skills 
to identify the companies within your chosen industry that exist in your geo­
graphic region.

271
 Chapter 18: Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly Companies
Before you jump into searching for job openings, take a moment to create 
a clear description of what you’re looking for. Your search criteria must 
include a concise description of what you intend to provide to an employer, 
the kind of organization it is, and your search radius. Having this list of cri­
teria in mind helps you keep your focus as you embark on your search for 
companies.
Considering the work you want to do
To identify potential green companies, you must have a clear sense of what 
you can offer. Refer to Chapter 17 for guidelines on how to articulate the way 
your skills, experience, and education can help green companies meet the 
challenges they face. 
As part of your own clarification process, examine which green industries are 
likely to need people with your skills. For the sake of focus, start with a list 
of one to three target industries. If one of the industries doesn’t pan out, you 
can always swing back to the drawing board to pick up another one. 
If you haven’t yet established the best way to weave your skills, interests, 
and experience to identify your green focus, see Chapters 4 through 6. Having 
clarity about your focus is one of the keys to finding your green job. 
Describing the organization 
With your target industries in mind, your next step is to define the character­
istics of the organization you want to work for. Review your past work set­
tings and current lifestyle needs to identify which settings are more inviting 
to you than others. The clearer you can be about the specific characteristics 
of your desired organization, the easier it will be to keep your research target 
in focus. 
	
Don’t feel you have to limit yourself to just one picture. Think in terms of your 
top two or three choices. 
To the degree that you can, include the following characteristics in your 
description of your ideal organization:
	
✓	Kind of organization: Do you want to work for a nonprofit, educational 
institution, or governmental agency? How about a start-up or private 
company? Based on what you know about your work style, what’s the 
best kind of organization for you?
	
✓	Company size: What size company do you want to work in? You may 
want to consider the number of employees, the overall size of the orga­
nization, or their market share.

272
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	Company reach: Do you want to work for an organization with a 
regional, national, or a global reach? Does your ideal company have a 
virtual presence or a brick and mortar location?
	
✓	Company purpose: Do you prefer to contribute to a particular purpose 
with your work hours? Perhaps you like to work in a research facility, for 
a manufacturer, or in an educational establishment. 
	
Nicole knew from past experience that she felt more engaged and fulfilled 
when she worked in small offices and had the flexibility to work both in and 
out of the office. In figuring out where she wanted to use her talents, she 
decided to focus on nonprofit organizations, small companies, and education 
centers. She also decided that her ideal picture was to work for an organiza­
tion that had an impact on her region and had less than 50 employees. 
If you’d like more help sorting out your preferences on these factors, see 
Chapter 6 for more details and descriptions of these key concepts.
Setting your search radius
Location, location, location. A green job across the country or across the 
state doesn’t do you much good unless you’re willing and able to relocate. 
Before you begin your actual job search, take the time to determine the 
boundaries of your search. 
	
Find a map of your area, ideally one you can actually unfold and place on the 
table in front of you. Take a good look at your region and make note of how 
far you are willing to commute. Do any of the transportation corridors have 
a mass transit system that would make a longer commute more feasible? To 
solidify your vision, literally draw the perimeter of your proposed search terri­
tory on the map. As you locate green companies, use push-pins or sticky notes 
to identify the companies’ locations on the map. Having a visual representation 
of your search gives you a sense of where the key players are in your area. 
If you’re willing to relocate, think about where you would like to move. Of 
course, there’s a bit of a chicken and egg dilemma here. Do you decide where 
you want to relocate and then find a green job there? Or do you decide what 
kind of green job you want and then figure out where you should live? The 
best strategy may be to work the questions from both directions. Where are 
the hot spots for your target industry. Of those areas, where would you most 
like to live? 
	
If you do discover a company that is clearly outside your target area, either 
locally or in another region, you have the opportunity to make a very con­
scious decision about whether and how to proceed. The key is that defining 
your search territory allows you to sort through the trade-offs in a manner 
that keeps you in touch with your personal needs and desires.

273
 Chapter 18: Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly Companies
	
As David researched companies that matched his target characteristics, he 
noted that several interesting companies were outside his geographic comfort 
zone. Before he pursued actual job openings, he evaluated how he’d proceed 
with each company. Working at one company would extend his commute by 
15 minutes and the other would require that he relocate within the same met­
ropolitan region. To further his evaluation, he did some additional research 
about each company and determined that the closer company was worth con­
sidering due to its one-of-a-kind technology. The other company was intrigu­
ing, but not interesting enough to take his kids out of their current school. 
Finding Triple Bottom Line Companies 
With your desire to work for a sustainable, triple bottom line company — one 
that pays attention not just to profit but social and environmental impact — 
and that matches your career goals, you now need a strategy to uncover 
companies in your area that fit the bill. 
As noted earlier, there aren’t many green/sustainable/triple bottom line com­
pany lists out there yet. To find the organizations of interest, you must do 
your own legwork. To put yourself in the right frame of mind for this project, 
retire your job seeker persona for now and step into your detective alter ego. 
During this phase, you must be driven to uncover clues and follow them up 
to find what you’re looking for.
As you begin this process, create a spreadsheet and enter each potential 
company name as you find it. Include as much information as you can about 
Triple bottom line
Until fairly recently the main measure of a com­
pany’s success was determined by its financial 
bottom line. Was it making a profit or was it sus­
taining losses? Although companies have been 
managing their activities by using their financial 
profits as their guiding light for a very long time, 
many stakeholders have sustained losses while 
the company’s shareholders have celebrated 
their wins. 
Times are changing, and the way companies 
measure their success is too. Now in addition 
to watching the financial profits, companies 
are assessing their impact on their physical 
surroundings and their community as well. 
When companies pay attention to the people 
they touch, the environment they impact, and 
the profits they make, leaders make more sus­
tainable decisions overall. In fact, this way of 
doing business is causing companies to rethink 
how they produce their products and provide 
their services. In the process, the entire com­
pany system is becoming stronger.
Although the term triple bottom line may refer 
to specific reporting requirements, often it is 
used as shorthand for ventures that are socially 
responsible, green, and profitable.

each company’s Web site address, location, and type of business. (Later in 
this chapter you add a few more columns to record more in-depth research 
findings and your impressions.)
	
As you search for companies that match your criteria, there’s a tendency to 
want to figure it all out at once. As soon as you find a company name, you try, 
in that moment, to figure out whether there’s a fit. That’s putting a lot of pres­
sure on a blind date! By dividing up the tasks you can gather a lot of company 
names quickly and then later take your time sorting through which companies 
you want to pursue in more depth. The next section is about how to research 
each company to evaluate whether it’s a good fit for you and your needs.
Surveying media coverage
Media sources are valuable tools as you collect company names for your list. 
Consider the following sources:
	
✓	Major media sources: If you’re looking for names of cutting-edge com­
panies, look to lists of hot green companies put out by magazines and 
blogs. Newsweek (www.newsweek.com/id/215577) and Fast Company 
(www.fastcompany.com/fast50_07) are two media outlets that come 
to mind. Use these lists to spot trends, find company names, and take a 
fascinating look into the future.
	
✓	Local media: To find companies in your area, check local media sources 
to see if they’ve profiled any interesting green businesses or compiled a 
list of green companies in your area.
	
✓	Niche media: Web sites that cater to a particular demographic group or 
geographic region may also provide valuable lists of green companies. 
	
✓	Press releases: Companies that have just launched, received funding, 
released a new product, or been included on a top green companies list 
are bound to distribute press releases to celebrate their achievement. In 
your favorite search engine, use terms such as “target industry” + “press 
release” to find relevant press releases. 
Following the money
Financial news is also a source of information about green or sustainable 
companies. 
	
✓	Green investor information: Companies that help individual investors 
make good financial decisions often provide information about the 
companies that qualify for their green lists. Some financial entities 
show you stock quotes (www.sustainablebusiness.com/stocks), 
whereas others tell you which companies are included in their funds 

275
 Chapter 18: Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly Companies
(http://newalternativesfund.com/returns/returns_list.
html). The Global 100 provides investors with a list of the 100 most sus­
tainable corporations worldwide (www.global100.org).
	
✓	Venture capital updates: Where venture capitalists are investing gives 
you a broad sense of which industries are growing, staying stable, and 
contracting. If you dig into the blogs that report on companies that are 
getting new funding or additional rounds of funding, you can then track 
the company’s progress as they move their product to market. See this 
book’s online Cheat Sheet (www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/green
careers/) for a list of blogs.
	
✓	Stimulus fund distributions: Until 2012, various governmental agencies 
will be awarding grants and distributing money to local governments, 
state governments, agency projects, and companies. The best places 
to track money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act are 
www.recovery.gov and www.recovery.org. 
Finding the right lists and directories
Slowly but surely blogs and media sources are publishing lists of the top 
companies in various fields. When you find a list that matches your targeted 
industry, celebrate — you’ve just struck a vein of gold! To locate such a list 
for your industry, try a search using “target industry” + “company list.”
If you haven’t found a targeted list, you may be able to find the kinds of com­
panies you’re looking for on a number of other lists: 
	
✓	Green energy/power lists: Several organizations, such as the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA — www.epa.gov/greenpower/
toplists/top50.htm) report on companies that are purchasing the 
most green energy. This is actually a fairly good objective measure of a 
company’s green mission. Business Week recently put out a list of the 
companies that have reduced their carbon footprint significantly (www.
businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_50/b3963415.htm).
	
✓	Green business organizations: Another intriguing way to discover green 
or socially responsible companies is to identify associations where 
green businesses are members. Often these organizations, such as the 
Social Venture Network (www.svn.org), include a list of their members 
on their Web sites.
	
✓	Green business directories: Although some directories are like typical 
phone directories, where green businesses can purchase a listing, there 
are other green directories in which companies are screened to ensure 
that they meet the directory’s standards for sustainability. The Green 
Pages Directory (www.coopamerica.org/pubs/greenpages) is a 
good example. 

276
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	Job boards: Although most people use job boards to find job openings, 
you can also use green job boards to research green/sustainable com­
panies in a particular profession, industry, or geographic area. Most 
of the larger green/sustainable job boards include an advanced search 
function that allows you to filter results according to your criteria. (See 
the online Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/green
careers/ for a list of popular job boards.) If your profession or field 
has a job board of its own, check that one out too. 
	
✓	Sponsors: Another productive source of business names is to look at 
who is sponsoring your industry’s conference or your local community’s 
Earth Day celebration. Any company paying to sponsor an event is 
either brand new and trying to gain exposure or doing well enough to be 
able to afford the sponsorship fees. 
Drawing on your social networking 
connections
After completing your own online research, reach out to your network. Be as 
specific as possible in describing your target company profile to your con­
tacts. With a clear picture of what you’re looking for, your contacts are better 
equipped to provide you with referrals that produce solid results. 
	
✓	In-person network: Reach out to those in your network who are con­
nected to your industry. You might send out an e-mail letting them know 
the research you’ve already done and asking them what you are missing 
or what other companies they’d recommend you contact.
	
✓	Twitter: If you’ve developed a group of followers in your field and 
related fields on Twitter, create a succinct tweet (what other kind is 
there?) asking for company ideas. You might ask for names of compa­
nies doing cutting-edge work in your industry or companies in your 
region. Do some homework on your own first so you know exactly how 
to describe the companies that will match your target range. 
	
✓	LinkedIn: As a member of LinkedIn, you can do a fair amount of 
research yourself on various company profiles. You might search for 
people who are doing the job you want to have to figure out where they 
work. Then click through to the company profile to gain insights about 
the company itself. 
	
	See Chapter 15 for detailed instructions on using LinkedIn and Twitter. 

277
 Chapter 18: Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly Companies
Deepening What You Know about 
Your Target Companies
As soon as you have a list of companies that may meet your criteria, set aside 
time to research what you can about each one. Remember that these compa­
nies do not need to have active job openings at the moment. 
	
Before you proceed, it’s time to take your research tracking procedures up a 
notch. Think about how you process information from multiple sources. Are 
you better off working online or putting new information into a hard copy 
format? Or do you have a hybrid approach where you bookmark sites and 
write your impression into a notepad? Whatever you decide to do, keep doing 
it. Consistency is going to pay off when you need to look back at your notes 
later in your job search.
	
Consider creating a column in your spreadsheet or notebook to insert your 
rating of each company or organization. By setting up your own rating system, 
you have a quick way to assess how well each meets your needs. Something 
as simple as this can do the trick: 
	
✓	+: Company is definitely worth more research
	
✓	0: Company might be okay if there’s nothing else on the horizon
	
✓	-: Company isn’t worth pursuing
Finding the information you need
The key to gaining insight about your top targets is to keep your focus on 
your ultimate goal, whether you’re exploring career options or searching for 
a job. 
Use the following research strategies to gather the information you need to 
understand the situation in your industry:
	
✓	Exploring online: Start your research online. It’s amazing what you can 
find out about a company by using some carefully crafted search terms. 
Refer to Chapter 14 for information about researching your target indus­
try. Many of the same tactics can be used to find out more about your 
target companies.

278
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	Mining your network: Your personal and professional networks are 
your next best strategy. Who do you know who may know something 
about the company as a current or former employee, customer, vendor, 
or colleague? The information each contact can provide varies depend­
ing on his/her relationship with the company. Think through your ques­
tions ahead of time to choose questions that are relevant, based on your 
contacts’ relationship with the company.
	
✓	Gathering information personally: Your interactions with the company 
can provide a treasure trove of insights as long as you pay close atten­
tion during all your interactions. A phone call answered by the recep­
tionist, a conversation with an employee at a trade show booth, and a 
walk to a hiring manager’s office can all provide layers of clues about the 
company and what they are about. Record your impressions and discov­
eries so you can refer back to your notes as you try to assess how well 
the company matches your green career goals.
Understanding what the company does
As you begin exploring your target companies, your first goal is to get a grasp 
of what the company does and for whom. In this initial research, you want to 
determine the size and structure of the company and how established it is. In 
other words, is it in a research and development mode or does it have actual 
products and services on offer?
To find this information, use the following resources: 
	
✓	Company Web site: Scour the company’s Web site, reading everything 
you can find about the company.
	
✓	Online search: Use a search engine to search for the company name. 
Read any recent news accounts and their back story if you can find it.
	
✓	LinkedIn: Search for the company on LinkedIn by clicking the 
Companies tab. Review the summary of the organization and make note 
of any contacts you may know who currently work there or did at one 
time.
Before you move on, remember to record your initial impression of the com­
pany on your spreadsheet or notepad, based on what you’ve discovered thus 
far. Your quick assessments can tell you at a glance which companies are 
which and whether you want to pursue your research. 
	
If you want to continuing gathering information about the company, set up a 
Google Alert at www.google.com/alerts with the company name. Having 
news items and media mentions dropped in your e-mail inbox is a great way to 
stay on top of what’s happening with a particular company. If you plan to use 
Google Alerts consistently, consider creating a free e-mail account for these 
alerts to keep them all in one place.

 Chapter 18: Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly Companies
Digging in to discover what you 
can do for the company
For the companies at the top of your list, it’s time to pull out all the stops. Do 
what you can to discover the good, bad, and the ugly. To ferret out this infor­
mation, you are going to have to use all the research skills you possess. 
	
If your target company is private, very small, or in research and development 
(R&D) mode, you may have a difficult time getting much information from the 
Web. If this is the case, turn to conversations with your contacts to garner 
additional insights. You may also want to invest time in understanding the 
current state of the industry as a whole to improve your chances of piecing 
together what you do discover about your target company. As you conduct 
your research, pay particular attention to the following three categories of 
information:
	
✓	Unearthing the opportunities the company is capitalizing on: You want 
to gain as much insight as you can about where the company is heading. 
Is it expanding services to a new customer base, adding a new technol­
ogy, or broadening its offerings? Knowing this information gives you a 
sense of the future of the company. Keep your eye on industry news, 
press releases, and the word on the street.
	
✓	Revealing the threats: Given what you know about the industry, your 
target company’s competitors, and the internal workings of the company, 
what strikes you as possible bumps in the road for this company? Are you 
picking up on anything that might derail the company completely? 
	
✓	Delineating the problems you can help solve: After doing your initial 
research, take some time to outline the problems the company may be 
facing that you could help solve. Tap into your work experience, educa­
tion, and training to bring your perspective to bear on the situation. 
What unique insights can you offer this company?
Evaluating the state of the company
Before you get too attached to working for a particular company, do your due 
diligence to obtain as much information as you can about its viability. 
	
✓	Is the company adequately funded? Whether the organization is owner 
funded, investor funded, or donor funded, you need to know whether 
the company is stable enough to pay your salary on an ongoing basis.
	
✓	Is the company ready for market? Does the organization have a proven 
technology or process, an active customer list, and the ability to deliver 
the product or service to its customers?

280
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	What do you know about the quality of the products or services? Can 
you find reviews online or talk to customers to get a sense of how well 
the company is meeting its customers’ needs?
	
✓	What’s the company’s history? How long has the company been in exis­
tence? What do you know about its history? 
	
✓	Where is it positioned in the industry? Is the company a front-runner 
or following along in the pack? 
	
If you’re thinking of working for an emerging company, go in with your eyes 
wide open to the possible risks. If the company is still figuring out what it’s 
selling or is fine-tuning its technology, you have little guarantee that it will 
survive in the long run. Sure, the ride to the big time may be exciting, but it 
also carries some inherent risks. Understanding this reality going in helps you 
make the right decisions for you and your family.
Assessing the company culture
As part of your company research, be sure to pay attention to clues about 
what it might be like to work at this company. Companies generally don’t pro­
vide much direct information about their culture. Do your best to discover 
what you can through your interactions with the company and through con­
versations with current employees, former employees, vendors, and custom­
ers. After gathering as much information as you can, read between the lines 
to develop a realistic picture of what’s happening on the inside. 
	
✓	Work environment: Discover what you can about how the office is 
structured. Where you spend a big chunk of each day has a big impact 
on your level of satisfaction. If you have the opportunity to visit the 
company on an informational interview or job interview, imagine work­
ing there. Be honest with yourself about your first reactions. If the work 
site resembles a college apartment, construction zone, or zoo, you may 
want to consider other options.
	
✓	Team dynamics: Notice what you can about the interplay between vari­
ous members of the company. Do they have an easygoing communica­
tion style or are tension and formality in the air? During your interview 
everyone is likely to be on their best behavior, so rely on body language 
and the undercurrents in the office to make your assessment.
	
✓	Management style: Assess this by looking at the entire management 
team. Do you know anyone who has worked for any of these people in 
the past? Can they tell you what it’s really like to work under them? Your 
immediate manager also has a large influence on how you experience 
the management style of a company on a day-to-day basis. As you get 
farther into the interview process, be sure to evaluate the management 
style of your potential manager.

281
 Chapter 18: Targeting the Right Eco-Friendly Companies
	
✓	Mission and values: Read and reflect on any material you find that 
shares the focus of the company. Its Web site, marketing materials, and 
annual reports are good resources for evaluating its stated mission. 
Look for signs in the press and on the premises that the company is 
actually living up to its mission statement and values. 
Confirming that the company 
walks the walk
You certainly don’t want to start working for a company that is all talk and no 
action when it comes to greening the company. There’s nothing more frus­
trating than going to work to make significant changes only to discover that 
you’ve been duped by a very effective green-washing campaign.
Yet companies work hard to project a certain image of their products and 
their reputation. As you review information about the company, your job is 
to compare its story with what you are actually discovering. In a nutshell, 
you want to know that the company is what it says it is. This vetting process 
is especially important regarding policies and results regarding sustainabil­
ity, energy efficiency, and carbon emissions reductions. 
Take the time to explore this topic as much as you can upfront. Although 
your efforts may not uncover the whole truth, hopefully you get enough of a 
realistic picture of the company that you feel comfortable working there or 
you see the writing on the wall before you sign the employment contract.
In the process of ascertaining what your target company stands for, you may 
want to look at third-party assessments of the company and its work:
	
✓	Awards and recognition: Do you see any evidence that the company has 
recent accolades from the media, its industry, or other organizations? 
	
✓	Affiliations with recognizable organizations: Does the company have 
a green business certification icon or a membership with an association 
known for sustainability or social responsibility?
	
✓	Ratings on sites that evaluate performance: Climate Counts offers a 
score card on companies’ efforts to address climate change. See if your 
target is listed: http://climatecounts.org/scorecard_over
view.php. If you don’t see your target company there, read up on other 
companies in the same genre to see what actions they are taking to 
become more sustainable. Then download the Climate Counts Criteria 
(http://climatecounts.org/pdf/Climate_Counts_Scorecard.
pdf) to see if your target company is making any of the efforts listed. 

282
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	Corporate social responsibility or sustainability reports: A number of 
companies are now publishing reports about their efforts to become 
more sustainable or socially responsible. You may be able to find a link 
to this sort of report on the company’s Web site. If you aren’t successful, 
do a search by using one or more of these keyword options: “company 
name” + “sustainability report” or “company name” + “corporate social 
responsibility report” or “company name” + “environmental report” to 
pull up a report. You may also want to check out www.socialfunds.
com/report to see if the site has a report for your target company.

Finding Openings for Your Talents 
In This Chapter
▶	Unearthing green job openings
▶	Getting your story straight for your interviews
▶	Becoming your own boss
Y
ou are getting close to the prize now. You know what you have to offer 
potential employers. You know the kind of company that’s likely to hire 
you and that fits your needs. Now it’s time to make things happen.
	
Looking for a job is not like going shopping. You can’t just pluck a job open­
ing off the shelf and move to the register. It’s more like a treasure hunt where 
multiple players are after the same prize. To have any chance to win you must 
actively search for clues and adjust your decisions based on the clues as you 
find them. 
	
The dynamics of the current job market influence your experience. To under­
stand why this is true, compare it to the real estate market. 
	
✓	Too much supply, not enough demand:
 
• Real estate market: When there are too many houses on the 
market, sellers must work extra hard to snag a buyer. The buyers 
can make demands and requests, and often get accommodated 
because the seller is willing to play let’s make a deal to move the 
house. This is called a buyer’s market.
	
	Job market: When there are too many job openings and not 
enough job seekers, employers must find inventive ways to lure 
in qualified job candidates. This is referred to as a job seeker’s 
market.

284
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	Not enough supply, too much demand:
 
• Real estate market: When there are too few houses on the market, 
sellers are in the catbird seat. They can pick and choose to whom 
they want to sell their property. It’s the buyers who must impress 
the seller. This is a seller’s market. 
 
• Job market: When there are too few job openings, employers don’t 
have to work very hard to fill their positions. In fact, they get inun­
dated by so many queries from highly qualified job candidates that 
they may not need to advertise their openings. In this scenario, it’s 
the job candidate who must jump through hoops to get the attention 
of an employer. This is an employer’s market. 
	
In addition to understanding the dynamics at play in the overall economy, 
take a close look at the supply and demand issues within your target industry. 
If your industry is growing while the main economy is stagnant, or if people 
with your skill set are in short supply, you may have a lot more bargaining 
power than you might think. Pay attention to clues within your own industry 
to understand what dynamics are in play as you search for your job. 
Tapping Unadvertised Positions
No matter what the job market dynamics are, the best way to find job open­
ings is to interact with your contacts on a regular basis. 
	
Although you might be tempted to reach out to everyone in your network and 
ask them if they know of any job openings, this direct question is actually one 
of the quickest way to shut your contact down. They may want to help you, but 
if they don’t know of any openings or they don’t really know you well enough to 
trust you, they’ll avoid your e-mails and phone calls. In the end you’ll lose out.
A more viable strategy is to build strong relationships with people who work in 
or interact with your target companies. As they get to know and trust you, they’ll 
be more likely to share information about an opening when one comes available. 
You’re more likely to receive solid job leads through this organic process than 
you are by asking directly about job openings in your first conversation.
To unearth viable job openings by building relationships with your contacts, 
take the following actions:
	
✓	Be clear about what you want. 
 
• Know what you have to offer and be able to articulate it as clearly 
as possible (Chapter 17). 
 
• Describe in as much detail as possible the kind of job you want to 
have (Chapter 18).

285
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
 
• Stay focused on the companies that best match your needs and 
interests (Chapter 18).
 
• Reach out to your contacts to find out more about your target 
companies. Most of your contacts will be happy to help you with 
your research by giving you solid background information. You 
want them to agree to this first request so you can build an ongo­
ing relationship with them. 
 
• Use your initial conversations with your contacts to find out what 
your target companies are doing in the industry, what their work 
culture is like, what sustainability measures they’re taking, and who 
the top management is. The more you know about the company, the 
more prepared you are for potential job openings when they arise.
 
• Ask for referrals to people within your target companies. Search 
on LinkedIn for possible connections that can help you meet the 
people you want to meet. Continue your conversations about the 
company with new contacts you make.
	
✓	When you find a company that is a good match, take a close look at what 
they’re doing to see how you can contribute. Review your experience 
and skills to determine how you might fit their needs. 
	
Always be aware of the impression you’re making. You want your contacts to 
know who you are and what you have to offer in terms of knowledge and expe­
rience. You also want them to trust you. To facilitate this process, you must 
build a strong rapport with your contacts. 
When a position becomes available in your target company or even another 
company, your contacts will think of you because they’ve spoken to you 
about your interest in the company and know your strengths and talents. 
	
You never know what’s going to trigger the announcement of a new job open­
ing. New funding or a new project are the obvious reasons for hiring a new 
person, but not all positions open up for logical reasons. A number of per­
sonnel changes happen unexpectedly from the organization’s point of view. 
Someone may need to retire early due to elder-care issues, another may get 
promoted or need to relocate with a spouse, another may cut back her hours 
due to a difficult pregnancy. You never know what circumstances will create 
the job opening that has your name on it. Just remember that job opportuni­
ties do open up, even in a tight job market. 
Keeping Yourself in Front of 
Your Target Companies
As you wait for a job to open up, you must do everything in your power to 
keep yourself in the minds of your contacts. This is not a time to sit back 

286
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
and wait for things to happen. You must take a very active role in your own 
future. Pay attention. Be very intentional as you make connections. Review 
your notes frequently to connect the dots between different people, organi­
zations, and projects. The more you know about what’s happening in your 
target companies, the more likely you are to be in the right place at the right 
time to take advantage of a new opportunity. 
Use these methods to keep in contact with your contacts at your target 
companies:
	
✓	Be helpful. As you talk with your contacts in a company, contribute 
in ways that demonstrate your expertise and competitive advantage. 
You may be able to refer them to a potential partner, help them con­
nect with a powerful strategic alliance, share a new technology, or give 
them detailed information about a policy that is going to be put in place. 
Demonstrate what you know in a confident way that is helpful and not 
annoying.
	
✓	Find creative ways to get to know the management team. Scan your 
local newspaper’s business section and your association’s newsletter for 
upcoming events. If your community has a newspaper that’s dedicated 
to business news, check that calendar as well. If you notice someone 
from the company is going to make a speech, sit on a panel, or attend a 
conference, do what you can to attend. Listen carefully to pick up clues 
about the company’s direction, struggles, and opportunities. If possible, 
arrange to have one of your contacts introduce you to the key player. If 
you do it right, asking a well-thought-out question during a session can 
also give you good exposure.
	
✓	Share key information and resources. As you scan the industry news, 
keep your eye out for articles and announcements that might be helpful 
to your contact. Send them a quick note via LinkedIn with the link and a 
short explanation of why you’ve passed it on. 
	
Don’t sabotage your success by putting all your eggs in one basket. Always, 
always target several companies at once. Even when actively interviewing for 
a job opening, keep uncovering leads at other companies. 
For a while it may seem as though nothing is really happening. You’re putting 
time and effort into making connections, building relationships, and sharing 
your expertise, but you don’t have any job openings to show for your efforts. 
As long as you’re continuing to make contacts and having solid conversa­
tions, work through your frustration and keep on keeping on. At some point, 
you’ll reach a tipping point when a number of opportunities may pop at the 
same time. It’s as though you reach a critical mass and suddenly things start 
shifting. 

287
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
Refocusing Your Efforts When Necessary
Although you don’t want to switch up your strategy every other day or week, 
you do need to be aware of the writing on the wall. If you’re uncovering 
information that tells you that your current direction isn’t going to work, you 
must take a hard look at your strategy to determine your next move. 
If you aren’t finding the kind of job openings that you’d like in your area of 
expertise or your region, you have a couple of choices:
	
✓	Broaden your focus. Take another look at your ideal job description. 
Explore ways you might broaden your vision. 
 
• Look to another industry. Perhaps your skills could be valuable in 
another industry that’s in a growth mode. 
Employing traditional ways to find job openings
Generally speaking, only a small percentage 
of job openings are posted. In difficult eco­
nomic times, when there’s high unemployment, 
companies have no need to advertise their job 
openings because they have a constant supply 
of people who are searching for work. 
Although it’s not impossible to find a job through 
job boards or posted job openings, the chances 
are slim. When you look at job listings, don’t 
just limit yourself to looking for openings — use 
what you find as more input to your research on 
target companies. 
	✓	Searching for green jobs on general job 
boards: Finding the right combination of 
keywords is the best strategy for find­
ing relevant green job listings on general 
job boards. Although you may not be able 
to find a job that matches your skills, you 
may be able to identify companies in your 
region, determine which companies are 
hiring in general, and uncover informa­
tion about job titles and descriptions that 
you can apply in your other job search 
strategies.
	✓	Using niche job boards effectively: If you 
can locate a job board for your specific pro­
fession, visit often. In addition to using the 
job board to understand the various posi­
tions within your field, you may also find 
viable job openings.
	✓	Visiting company job listings: If you are tar­
geting a specific company, check its Web 
site for job openings. Keep in mind that the 
career section on any company site is part 
of the company’s PR machine. On this page 
the company is telling you what it wants you 
to know, and nothing else. Always double-
check your facts by conducting your own 
research, using other online sources, and 
talking to those in your network. 
Remember, the jobs you find listed on a job 
board are only a fraction of the openings that 
exist. Be sure to be in contact with your net­
work to find the job opening you are looking for.

• Emphasize a different skill. How might your job prospects be differ­
ent if you highlighted a different skill? 
 
• Explore other kinds of organizations. If you’ve been looking in the 
private sector, change your focus to look at your options in a gov­
ernmental or nonprofit setting. 
	
✓	Relocate. If you are open to some change, expand your geographic 
boundaries to see if job openings are available in another area. If you’re 
looking for your first job out of school, it will be worth your while to be 
willing to go where the jobs are. If you’re looking toward retirement, 
consider moving now to the place you ultimately want to live. 
	
✓	Rethink your approach. Talk to a few trusted colleagues or advisors 
about your job search. Let them know what’s working and what’s not 
working. They may be able to offer suggestions to help you redirect your 
job search efforts.
	
As you look at your situation, lay out your best options and review the pros 
and cons. Then put your notes away for a day or so. When you come back to 
them, incorporate any additional thoughts you’ve had about the subject. Then 
notice which idea feels most comfortable to you. Take actions to implement 
that option. 
Prepping for Your Interviews
When you receive the call to come in for an interview, you must be ready! 
The best strategy is to start preparing long before you even have an inter­
view scheduled. 
	
One of the benefits of prepping for your interview early is that you have ample 
time to practice describing your skills, talents, and accomplishments in casual 
conversation with your contacts. By testing out your points, you’re able to 
refine and improve them before you need to use them in your interviews. 
For more information about this topic, check out Job Interviews For Dummies 
by Joyce Lain Kennedy (Wiley, 2008).
Crafting relevant stories to back up 
your resume accomplishments
When you arrive at each interview, be prepared to pull up the details of each 
of the accomplishments listed on your resume and show the interviewer how 
your accomplishments prepare you to add value to the organization.

289
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
As you begin your preparation, look at the interview from both sides of the 
table:
	
✓	Consider the position you are interviewing for. What does the interviewer 
need to hear from you to recognize that you are a great fit for the position? 
If you were in their shoes, what would you want to know about you?
	
✓	Evaluate your best strategy for demonstrating your value to the com­
pany in this position. What are the most relevant accomplishments that 
you need to share in your interview? 
 
• Review the resume you submitted when you applied for the posi­
tion. At a minimum, you need to come up with stories that illus­
trate the accomplishments they’ve already read in your resume.
 
• Sort through the complete database of your accomplishments 
that you created in Chapter 17 (see the comments about how to 
develop persuasive accomplishments in that chapter) as you built 
your resume to discover any additional accomplishments. 
	
✓	Create a list of the accomplishments you want to have at the ready 
during your interview. Then work with each one to come up with the 
best way to tell the story. Be sure that your accomplishments highlight 
your competitive advantage (see Chapter 17), demonstrate the impact 
you’ve had on the bottom line of your previous employers, and tie 
directly to the position being discussed. Be explicit in how you connect 
the dots for the interviewer.
Long, rambling, unfocused stories won’t do you any favors during your inter­
view. Tell the critical points in a few sentences. Practice, practice, practice. 
Record yourself telling the stories if possible. Notice whether the story is 
clear and your tone is right. When you feel fairly comfortable with each story, 
share it in conversation to see what kind of response you get from your con­
tacts. Keep going back to the drawing board until you know exactly how to 
talk about your most outstanding accomplishments. 
	
Don’t even think about winging your interview. Imagine the impression you’ll 
make if you don’t remember what you have on your own resume or if you 
stumble while talking about your previous positions!
	
Share your accomplishments even if no one specifically asks you to during 
the interview. Find a way to weave each pertinent one into your conversation 
with the hiring manager or interviewer. “I think I know what you mean. Let me 
share what happened to me.…”
If you don’t share your value, the interviewer won’t see you as a good fit for 
the position and will hire someone else.

290
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
Practicing for the big event
It’s one thing to work out all the details of your interview presentation on 
paper or in a spreadsheets. It’s quite another to speak about yourself in a 
clear, concise way. In addition to summarizing your accomplishments, you 
must be prepared to answer broader questions about yourself, including 
your strengths and weaknesses, your long-term goals, your passion about the 
field, and why you feel you are well suited to this position.
Although practicing in front of a mirror is a step in the right direction, it’s 
unlikely you’ll receive constructive feedback from your mirror. The best way 
to build your confidence and refine your pitch is to partner up with a variety 
of people to practice articulating who you are and to receive suggestions 
to help you strengthen your story. Consider connecting with the following 
people as you prepare for your interviews: 
	
✓	Other job seekers, either individually or through a job search support 
group, feel your pain and are prepping for their interviews. Mutual inter­
view prep support can lead to a number of insights and benefits. 
	
✓	A mentor who has experience in the kind of work environment you want 
to work in can be invaluable. Whether they have a history of working for 
the government, in private enterprises, for educational institutions, or for 
nonprofits, they’ll be able to help you set the right tone for your interview. 
	
✓	A career counselor knows the most effective ways for you to present 
yourself in the current job market.
	
✓	A trusted friend knows you well and can see ways to articulate who you 
are that you may not see yourself.
	
✓	A colleague knows your work and believes in your talents.
Doing your homework for each company
Don’t be caught off guard in the interview by recent news about the com­
pany. Make it your business to know what’s going on for the companies 
you’re targeting. As you prepare for the interview, review what you already 
know about the company from your sources. Then update your knowledge 
for the latest information.
If you’ve already done a fair amount of research on the company to include 
them on your list of target companies, you’re in good shape. You just need 
to make sure that you have the latest updates. If an interview comes out of 
left field, you may need to do some catch-up work to get a good sense of the 
company and what it does. Refer to Chapter 18 for tips on how to research a 
company. 

291
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
To find out information about the company’s latest news, read recent press 
releases put out by the company, recent media stories, and whatever you can 
find about the company online. Scour the company’s Web site for new infor­
mation, and check out the company’s LinkedIn profile as well.
As you scan the resource, notice changes in the following:
	
✓	Changes in management
	
✓	Any big announcements, from the launch of a new product to a report 
about a quality issue with last year’s model
	
✓	New funding
	
✓	What its key competitors are doing
By demonstrating awareness of the current events of the company, you 
show that you’re investing yourself in the industry and in your job search. 
Demonstrating your commitment to your job search shows the employer 
what you’re capable of.
Building a list of powerful questions
You can show your interest in the company by arriving at your interview 
with a set of prepared questions. Instead of the typical tit-for-tat interview 
exchange, the interview can become an engaging two-way conversation that 
leaves both you and your interviewer feeling intrigued enough to want to 
have another conversation.
When you capture interviewers’ attention in this way, they’ll recognize that 
you aren’t just another run-of-the-mill job candidate. As soon as they recog­
nize your value, they’ll want you and they’ll start selling you on the value of 
the company and the position. 
	
Building a list of thoughtful questions takes some time, so don’t leave this task 
to the last minute. Don’t include questions on your list that you could research 
yourself on the organization’s Web site or Google. Think instead of questions 
that demonstrate that you already know something about the industry and the 
company or that reinforce your genuine interest in the company and the work.
	
✓	Questions about the work: What you’d do for the company is of utmost 
importance to you. Ask about the projects you’ll work on, the team 
you’ll work with, the resources you’ll have. As you move into the inter­
view process, you may have the opportunity to meet your team and see 
the work space. Pick up visual and nonverbal cues about what it’s really 
like to work for the company. 

292
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
	
✓	Questions about the company: An important part of the interview pro­
cess is for you to gain a sense of the company and how it functions. You 
might want to ask about the work environment, the culture, the compa­
ny’s long-term strategy, and anything else that will help you determine 
whether you want to work there. If the company has a good description 
on its Web site, you could ask for clarification or further detail about 
some element that’s important to you. 
	
✓	Questions about sustainability initiatives: Hopefully you’ve been able 
to read about the company’s efforts to become more sustainable. If it 
has a sustainability report of any kind, be sure to read it over before 
your interview. In your questions, indicate that you’ve read the docu­
ment and then pose a question to clarify some portion of the report. You 
might also ask, if it’s not already clear, how involved employees are in 
the process of moving the company to more sustainable practices.
	
	Beware not to sound preachy or pushy about your own beliefs on sus­
tainability. Your job interview is not the time or the place to push your 
agenda on this topic. 
	
✓	Questions about your team: If you’re being hired for a management 
position, ask about your team. You might want to know the size of the 
group, the experience levels, their morale, their current priorities.
	
Hold off asking about salary and benefits until those topics are raised by the 
interviewer in the interview process. 
Creating Your Own Position
Under certain circumstances you may be able to create an opportunity in 
your target company. This is especially true if you want to be in a green 
industry that is just developing or if you have a skill that allows you to dem­
onstrate to key decision makers what you can do for the company.
	
Don’t get bogged down by what form the job might take. The key is to get 
yourself in the door to make a contribution that gets the attention of key mem­
bers of the management team. Whether they hire you as an employee, retain 
your services as a consultant, or give you a stellar recommendation you can 
use to land your next gig, you’d be farther along than you are right now. 
	
✓	Investigating the industry: The key to creating your own position is 
understanding your target industry inside and out. You must under­
stand how the industry is structured, what opportunities the industry 
has as well as the challenges it faces. Although there’s a learning curve 
involved with this option, you may be able to short-circuit the process 
if you can tap into an industry or function that is in some way related to 
your previous work experience. 

293
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
	
✓	Knowing what you have to offer: Take a hard look at the work experi­
ence you have. Everything you’ve done before gives you perspective, 
insights, and innovative solutions. Leverage that information as you 
scan your new target industry for problems you can help solve. 
	
✓	Identifying a problem you can solve that impacts the company’s 
bottom line: Begin by thinking about ways you can help the company 
save or make money. With the current economic situation, I can’t imag­
ine a company turning away someone who has an idea to save it a size­
able amount of money. Business owners aren’t crazy! If an idea makes 
sense from a business standpoint, they’ll consider it.
 
• Do you know, or can you come up with, a way to cut costs for 
energy, fuel, or water? Most likely the solution you discover will be 
green and help the company become more sustainable. Even if the 
company doesn’t have an initiative to move in this direction, show­
ing them the numbers may open their eyes to a new, more effective 
way of doing business. 
 
• Do you have ideas about ways to reuse, sell, or reduce waste in 
the company’s manufacturing process or service? Solutions in this 
category may save the company money in terms of waste disposal 
while also cutting costs for new materials. 
	
✓	Pitching your solution to the key decision maker: Get in front of the 
key decision maker and share the results you can deliver. They’ll listen, 
especially if you meet them where they live: the financial impact of your 
solution. Be careful not to share how you’d implement your full idea. 
You want to get their attention, but you don’t want to tell them so much 
that they can do it themselves without hiring you. 
	
✓	Negotiating the contract for your services: Before you begin to nego­
tiate your contract, be clear about the value of your solution. Talk to 
others in the field to determine how much impact your solution will 
have on the company.
	
You don’t have to be approaching the biggest company in your area. Small 
companies are looking for ways to save money too. Look at the companies in 
your town or city to find opportunities. Test out your ideas in a small enter­
prise and use their story as a case study to gain more gigs. If you find a solu­
tion you can provide that matches the needs of several kinds of companies, 
your potential for finding opportunities can double or triple.
By moving in this direction, you are gaining valuable skills, experiences, and 
accomplishments that will continue to open doors as more and more compa­
nies become sustainable.

Making the Decision to Start 
Your Own Business
If you have a novel idea or know you feel more fulfilled working indepen­
dently, you may decide to launch a start-up company, run an existing small 
business, or start a consultancy.
There are plenty of small business opportunities in the green economy:
	
✓	Green an existing business in your area, whether it’s a printer, dry 
cleaner, cleaning company, local bookstore, bakery, or some other venture.
	
✓	Become a consultant. Leverage your existing experience and expertise 
to determine your best opportunity as a consultant. Ideas include, but 
are in no way limited to, becoming a sustainability consultant, energy 
efficiency consultant, organic gardening consultant — the list goes on.
	
✓	Come up with a small business that is green from the start. Take stock 
of your community. What opportunities do you see to help your area 
step up to more sustainable actions?
	
✓	Purchase a franchise with a green focus or green element. For more 
information about how to identify a franchise that fits your interests, 
values, and situation, visit www.frannet.com. Not all their franchises 
can be deemed be green, but more and more franchises have a green 
element. More solidly green opportunities are bound to follow. 
	
✓	Develop an online business that has a green mission.
	
✓	Launch a cutting-edge start-up based on an innovative idea or 
technology.

Evaluating your entrepreneurial 
temperament
Working on your own takes a certain kind of mindset. Some people thrive as 
entrepreneurs while others crumble. Nothing is guaranteed when you run 
your own business. It all starts with you, your vision, your commitment, your 
ability to manage risks, and your ability to persevere through thick and thin.
To succeed, you must be a self-starter, be able to manage your own time, 
work with and through a full array of emotions effectively, and know how to 
move yourself beyond feeling stuck. 

295
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
Having a clear understanding of your personal style, temperament, and 
strengths is critical to your success as an entrepreneur. Purposefully choose 
or build your business to leverage what you do well. You must also know 
what you don’t do well or what you are not well suited to do. Acknowledging 
these truths allows you to find team members, vendors, or family members 
to fill in the roles that you know you don’t do well. 
	
Sarah is a self-starter with a constant flow of ideas and visions. Although 
these skills helped her start a business, it’s also left her with an array of 
half-finished projects. To succeed, she realizes that she needs to surround 
herself with an administrative assistant or business partner who is a finisher; 
someone who excels at creating and implementing systems, pushing projects 
to completion, and keeping her focused when she’s excited by another new, 
completely unrelated idea. 
To explore additional entrepreneurial characteristics, read this article: www.
sideroad.com/Entrepreneur/become_an_entrepreneur_2.html.
Assessing the viability of your idea
Starting a business isn’t something you do on-the-fly. You must research your 
idea, develop a plan, and then test it out. You may need to run through this cycle 
several times before you nail down your idea in enough detail that it’s successful. 
Review the following components of your business idea to verify its viability:
	
✓	Customers: Obviously your idea must appeal to customers to be suc­
cessful. The fact that you see that they need what you have isn’t enough. 
They must see that they need what you have and they must be willing 
to pay for it. Build a profile of your ideal target customer to refine your 
marketing pitch.
	
✓	Business model: As you explore your business idea, make sure that the 
numbers work. Explore different production and distribution methods to 
find the one that is most effective. Make sure that your business model 
is sustainable over the long haul.
	
✓	Profits: You must also estimate how your product or services prices out. 
What can you sell it for? What does it cost you to make your product or 
provide your service? How much will you need to charge to distribute 
your creation? All the numbers must line up so you end up with a profit 
at the end of the day. 
	
✓	Resources: You must also figure out the materials and resources you 
need to put your idea into production. If you’re going to market your 
product or service as green or sustainable, you must take the time to 
assess each input, source the best materials, and track developments as 
new, more ecologically sound materials come on the market.

296
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
If you’ve never started a business before, take a course on becoming an 
entrepreneur, work with a business coach, or hire a business consultant to 
help you evaluate the viability of your idea.
Taking the right steps to thrive
Building a thriving business doesn’t happen overnight. Sure, purchasing an 
existing business or buying a franchise gives you a head start, but it doesn’t 
guarantee full success. 
As you explore the idea of creating your own business, build the following 
elements into your plan:
	
✓	Define the vision for your company. Think about the business you 
ultimately want to have and then lay out the steps you’ll need to take to 
get there. Keep in mind that your vision may morph as you gain more 
insights about your industry, market, and customers. 
	
✓	Gather as much information as possible about your business topic. 
You must be an expert in your field. Attend trade shows, take classes, 
read books, and stay on top of current news. Depending on the focus 
of your business and how rapidly your industry is changing, continuing 
education may be a part of your life from here on out. 
	
✓	Train yourself to run a business. If you’ve never run a business before 
or if you’ve run a business that wasn’t very successful, invest as much 
time grasping the ins and outs of being a business owner as you do find­
ing out about your industry. Turn to the following For Dummies books 
as a starting point: 
 
• Small Business For Dummies by Eric Tyson and Jim Schell (Wiley)
 
• Starting an Online Business For Dummies by Greg Holden (Wiley)
 
• Home-Based Business For Dummies by Paul Edwards, Sarah 
Edwards, and Peter Economy (Wiley)
	
✓	Take the time to develop a plan for your business. Having a plan 
helps you keep your focus, stop possible problems early, and track 
your progress. 
 
• One Page Business Plans are a great place to start clarifying your 
thinking. If you aren’t looking for external financing, it may be all 
you need: www.onepagebusinessplan.com.
 
• Strategic Planning For Dummies by Erica Olsen (Wiley) helps you 
explore all the strategic, long-term elements that go into planning 
for your business.

297
 Chapter 19: Finding Openings for Your Talents 
	
✓	Work out your financing and pricing. Before you get in over your head, 
make sure that you have ample funding and that your pricing allows you 
to be profitable. If you aren’t familiar with assessing the financial side 
of a project, don’t lull yourself into thinking denial is the right answer. 
Reach out to financial professionals to get as clear as possible about this 
issue before you open the doors to your business.
	
✓	Identify your brand. Creating a clear way for people to differentiate you 
from other businesses owners is a critical step in building your busi­
ness. If you’re starting a new business that’s never been done before, 
this part of the process can be challenging because you have to educate 
people so they understand what you do. You may need to start your 
business and revisit your brand after you have more experience in your 
marketplace.
	
✓	Develop your marketing system. Having several repeatable marketing 
campaigns that consistently create awareness, leads, and sales is crucial 
to your success. Finding these marketing winners may take some experi­
mentation. Keep track of what you try and measure your results so that 
when you do find something that works, you know it.
	
✓	Build a support system. Running your own business is an intense expe­
rience. On any given day, you may be able to tackle exactly what’s on 
your to-do list or you may be called upon to put out a series of fires. If 
you don’t have a support system in place, being an entrepreneur can 
be completely overwhelming. Develop a mix of people you can connect 
with frequently:
 
• Make a list of the people in your profession or industry that you 
can call to ask questions and keep it where you can easily find it. 
 
• Find other business owners who have a similar business model 
or business but don’t compete with you directly. Be each other’s 
sounding board and brainstorming partner. 
 
• Surround yourself with family members and friends who believe 
in your venture and support you unconditionally. Sometimes a 
friendly voice on the other end of the phone can smooth out the 
rough edges of the day. 
If you find a business that’s a good match to your skills, interests, and tem­
perament, you can definitely impact your customers’ lives with your vision.

Taking Your Green Career 
to the Next Level
In This Chapter
▶	Broadening and strengthening your network 
▶	Finding creative ways to stay on top of changes in the green economy
▶	Identifying key opportunities for you and your company
▶	Preparing for your next career move
Y
ou’ve been hired! Congratulations. All the best to you as you settle into 
your new green career.
Although you may be tempted to think you are done networking, volunteer­
ing, tracking your chosen industry, and gaining new skills, you’ll be more suc­
cessful if you keep up with those activities. Staying up-to-date and engaged in 
your community pays good dividends throughout your career. 
This chapter gives you strategies to improve your performance on your current 
job, strengthen your knowledge, and prepare yourself for your next position 
when the time comes.
Staying Plugged In
Throughout your job search you focused on building your network. You 
spent time going to meetings, researching and networking online, reaching 
out to old friends, and connecting with new contacts. Hopefully you experi­
enced the benefits of building this network of connections. Perhaps you even 
identified your green career or found your new position as a direct or indi­
rect result of your connections. 
Now that you are gainfully employed, you have a wonderful opportunity to 
deepen your network even more. Even though you may feel too busy making 
connections at work to keep up with your old networking activities, you 
should keep in touch with those who helped you get where you are today. 

300
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
Continuing to nurture your network contributes to your new career by
	
✓	Getting you up to speed with the politics, key players, and priority initia­
tives in your new company
	
✓	Linking you up with resources you need to thrive in your new profession
	
✓	Identifying key educational or networking events for those in your field
	
✓	Staying up-to-date regarding changes in the local economy
	
✓	Tracking developments in your industry
	
✓	Being aware of personnel changes throughout your profession
	
Your connections are an asset for your long-term career success as well. 
Although it may not sound appealing at this moment, you are likely to make 
another career move in the future. Having an active, thriving network is likely 
to shorten your path to your next job. Instead of having to hunt down possible 
job openings, you are now in a position to be among the first to know about 
career opportunities. Imagine how nice it will be to be on the inside track of 
your profession during your job search rather than being on the outside trying 
to find a way in. 
Keeping in touch with your network
As you settle into your new position, figure out the best ways to keep in 
touch with your existing network. Given your new schedule, you may need to 
modify your strategies just a bit. 
Your first networking task is to share your big news with your entire network. 
Get back in touch with everyone you networked with during your job search. 
Share your story. Your contacts will love to hear how you landed your new 
position. Be sure to include your new contact information as well. You might 
want to connect personally, with a call or an in-person meeting, with anyone 
who had a profound impact on your job search process. 
Your next step is to update your LinkedIn profile and any other professional 
profiles you have online. Remove any indications that you are looking for a 
position and add the description of your new position. Use the Update fea­
ture on LinkedIn to share news about your new position. 
Then spend a little time coming up with a networking plan that will work with 
your new schedule. You might consider the following strategies:
	
✓	Incorporating social networking tasks into your week: Depending on 
your company and your position, some social networking activities may 
be seen as valuable on-the-job tasks. Take advantage of this opportunity 
if it is appropriate. 

301
 Chapter 20: Taking Your Green Career to the Next Level
	
✓	Identifying one or two relevant in-person networking events to go to 
each month: Be strategic as you identify these opportunities. You want 
to find events that will help you in your current position and allow you to 
keep your connections with former contacts as well. You might want to 
select one group that focuses on your profession or industry and another 
group that is a general green networking group.
	
✓	Finding a way to stay engaged in your community: Explore volunteer­
ing opportunities that energize you and contribute in some way. You 
might look to organizations that you already belong to for possible 
volunteer opportunities. For example, helping your child’s school, your 
church, your local neighborhood association, or your city go green 
could be beneficial to you on a personal and professional level.
Although you don’t want to burn yourself out with too many activities, you 
do want to find ways to stay engaged and in touch with those outside of your 
current company.
Broadening your network
As a new employee in your company, you also have ample opportunities to 
extend your network in new directions. In fact, you’ll be inundated with new 
introductions during your first few weeks at work. 
Be proactive and strategic as you make connections at work. Look beyond 
your own work group to get acquainted. Reach out to meet people in your 
department, other departments you are likely to interact with, your custom­
ers (if appropriate), and suppliers and vendors. You also want to connect 
with people in your profession, especially if you’ve just entered your field, 
and with colleagues who have your role in other companies. 
	
In addition to connecting with people on LinkedIn, be sure to collect contact 
information from those you meet. Maintain a database at work and at home so 
that you retain their contact information when you leave your current position.  
One of the most effective ways to build strong connections with new contacts 
is to meet with people in person. When you find someone who would be good 
for you to know, invite them to lunch or coffee. Keep nurturing your key con­
nections as you get established in your new role. 
Remember that networking is always a two-way street. Although you may 
have been more on the receiving end of your networking relationships while 
you were in job search mode, now is a perfect opportunity to be available 
to help others who are out of work or looking for a way into a new field, new 
profession, or a new company. Giving to others now makes you more memo­
rable to them when you need assistance in the future.

Expanding What You Know
The green economy is evolving every day. With every news cycle are 
announcements of new policies, new incentives, and new regulations. 
Company press releases announce new funding, new technologies, new pro­
cesses, and new systems. 
If you stick with what you know, you’re going to be behind before you even 
start! The key to staying competitive is to continuously enhancing your skills 
and knowledge. As you settle into your new position, be aware of the skills 
you’ll need to move to other positions within your current company. If you 
are not yet in your ultimate green career, continue to search for ways to pre­
pare for your next green career as well. 
On-the-job training
The most time-efficient and cost-effective way to expand your skills is to take 
advantage of training opportunities on the job. Watch for the following train­
ing options at work:
	
✓	If you’re in a new position, you’re likely to attend classes or get person­
alized training to master your current responsibilities. 
	
✓	It’s also possible that your company will send you to conferences, work­
shops, and training sessions for topics that are relevant to your current 
position. 
	
✓	You may discover online training options or local training opportunities 
that your company might fund if you can tie the content directly to your 
current responsibilities. 
	
✓	As you grow into your position, you’re in a perfect position to reach 
out to others for more informal training. Set up conversations with co-
workers in other areas of the company to see how their departments 
interface with your department. Getting a picture of how the organiza­
tion works gives you a powerful foundation for your own development. 
	
✓	If it makes sense for your chosen profession, explore certification oppor­
tunities. Talk to your manager to assess whether the company will fund 
this kind of development or if you need to finance it yourself. If the certi­
fication will open doors for you in the future, it may be worth obtaining 
the certificate even if you do have to pay for it yourself.

 Chapter 20: Taking Your Green Career to the Next Level
Exploring beyond the job
To develop skills or enhance your knowledge beyond what is required for your 
current position, you may want to invest your time in getting more training on 
your own:
	
✓	Reading books or listening to books on tape is one of the easiest ways to 
expand your knowledge. Take a book when you travel, read at night, or 
find a pocket of quiet time during the day for reading. 
	
✓	A number of organizations are providing online courses on a variety 
of sustainability subjects. These self-paced courses offer a timesaving 
alternative to in-person courses. 
	
✓	Check out courses at your local university, community college, or green 
organization. You may find an evening or weekend course you can take 
to add to your knowledge on a particular topic. 
	
✓	If you prefer hands-on training, search for opportunities to volunteer on 
projects at work or outside of work. In addition to developing new skills, 
you’ll have some accomplishments to add to your resume. 
Scanning the Horizon for Opportunities
One of the best ways to demonstrate your value to the company is by keep­
ing your eye on developments in your industry and profession and bringing 
word back to your employer about how those changes are likely to impact 
the company and the industry as a whole. Showing your company how to 
guard against problems looming on the horizon or act on opportunities 
makes you a very valuable employee. 
Tracking new trends in your industry
To identify upcoming trends and isolate potential problems, you must take 
an active role in scanning news of your industry. Begin by implementing the 
tactics described in Chapter 14 to track trends in your industry. Be sure to 
use Twitter searches, Google alerts, and an RSS feed of your industry blogs to 
get real-time announcements of developments. 
	
You may also have additional means available to you as an industry insider. 
Perhaps there’s a discussion forum you have access to as a member of your 
profession. Your professional association or trade organization may have an 

304
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
alert system in place for announcements of key developments. Visit your 
professional portals sign-up for these announcements. 
As you become more familiar with your industry and company, you’ll 
develop a sense of who knows the field inside and out. Keep your eyes open 
for someone in your network who has a deep understanding of your industry. 
Get in the habit of taking them to lunch every six months to get the straight 
scoop and hear about the industry comings and goings. 
Although professional conferences can be expensive, they can also be a trea­
sure trove of information about upcoming trends, key technological develop­
ments, and long-term issues. Do what you must to attend these conferences. 
Split the cost with your employer if necessary. Be sure to bring back valuable 
insights and predictions to demonstrate that the fees were well spent. Use 
your time at the conference to build strong relationships that you can count 
on in the future. 
Paying attention to changes 
within your company
Keep your eye on unfolding news within your company as well. If you’re part of 
a small company, this task may not be very hard. If your company is large and 
multi-faceted, you might want to set up a Google alert or Tweet search for your 
company name and key products or services you offer. Having real-time news 
coming to your inbox will help you stay on top of what the media is saying, 
what customers are sharing, and what your company is announcing. 
Make it a habit to check out your company’s press releases as well. Someone 
in your PR department is busy making announcements that may have bearing 
on your work. Some of those announcements may be trickling down to you, 
but others may not. 
Be aware of personnel changes in your company, as they may be the first 
signal of a change in strategy or emphasis within the company. If you link up 
with your contacts in the company, your daily LinkedIn updates may alert 
you to unexpected changes in their employment status or job title. You never 
know how subtle clues may shine light on a new development. 
Don’t just rely on your online sources to know what’s happening within your 
company. Be a part of the conversation at the proverbial water cooler as 
well. You may connect with people outside your usual circle of contacts in 
the cafeteria, out at local lunch places, or at the gym. These connections can 
provide valuable insights about developments within your company. 

305
 Chapter 20: Taking Your Green Career to the Next Level
Studying the moves of other companies
You may also discover valuable information by tracking your direct competi­
tors and companies in your region. Many of the same tactics I describe in 
Chapter 14 can be put to use here as well. 
You might want to develop relationships with colleagues at related com­
panies as appropriate. Clearly, you don’t want to give away any company 
secrets to your fiercest competitor, but you do want to have cordial interac­
tions that provide insights about the direction, performance, and opportuni­
ties the other company is pursuing. 
You may also find value in making connections within companies in analo­
gous industries, vendors, or suppliers. Your networking meetings should give 
you opportunities to meet people from these organizations. 
Plotting Your Next Career Move
Although it may not seem possible or probable right now, chances are good 
that you will want to transition into a new position at some point in the future. 
Whether you choose to switch jobs or you are forced to, change happens!
	
✓	If you’re in the field you want to be in, your change may be a lateral 
move to another company in the same industry, doing the work you are 
doing now. 
	
✓	If you aren’t yet in your desired target field, you may choose to make 
another move to attain your green career goal. 
	
✓	If your industry or profession changes in some way, you may find your­
self looking for a job because the landscape of the green economy has 
shifted in an unexpected way. 
	
Instead of being caught off guard by any of these potential changes, be aware 
of possible next steps in your career. As you build your network, always keep 
the needs of your current position in mind while also looking to your own 
future direction. 
Positioning yourself for the future
Every six months or so take stock of your current situation. What’s working 
in your current position? What could be working better? In what ways are 
you satisfied? In what ways are you frustrated? 

306
Part V: Activating Your Green Job Search 
Staying in tune with how you feel about your industry, your work, and your 
work environment allows you to make changes before you’re locked into a 
bad situation. Although you don’t want to create the impression that you’re a 
revolving door employee, you do need to manage your own career and move 
to the next position when the time is right for you.  
As you assess your current situation, whether it is good or bad at the moment, 
always think about where you’d like to go next. Revisit Chapters 4, 5, and 6 
periodically to review your interests, skills, and possible career directions. 
Update anything that feels outdated so that your lists of favorite interests and 
strengths reflect who you are now. Brainstorm possible options within your 
current field or identify your next field. 
As you connect with members of your network, talk to them about your inter­
ests in a casual, exploratory way. Begin to get a sense of the possibilities for 
your next professional move.
Finding creative ways to prepare
As soon as you identify a target or two, begin taking steps to prepare for your 
future. Review your resume and activities to determine what you need to add 
to move into your target field in the future. The sooner you identify what you 
need, the more time you have to put the pieces in place. 
Be creative. Obviously your current job responsibilities are your first prior­
ity, but that doesn’t mean you need to bury yourself in that role 24/7. Find 
ways to take strategic actions that help you gain skills, build your network, 
enhance your training, and strengthen your experience. 
Look for opportunities at work or in your personal life to build out your 
resume. Participate on committees, volunteer to be a liaison to the depart­
ment you want to move into, help plan a meeting that will put you in contact 
with people you want to meet, or head up a green project that’s beyond your 
current job description and in alignment with your career aspirations. 
When you put yourself out there, you never know who’ll notice your initia­
tive, your drive, and your creative spirit.

B
eing on top of the issues, trends, and innovations is the name of the 
game in the green economy. The more you know, the more you shine 
and the more valuable you become to potential employers. 
In researching this book I identified far more than ten great green resources. 
To pass these gems on to you, I’ve placed the links into ten categories. Just 
scan the headings to find materials that can help you with your green career. 
Making Sense of Global Warming
Although there are a number of good reasons to create a sustainable 
economy, one of the biggest motivators is the state of the Earth’s climate. 
Familiarizing yourself with the issues of global warming, climate change, and 
related issues provides you with a strong foundation for your green career. 
In addition, having an overview of the general concepts and issues helps you 
determine where you want to focus your time, energy, and talents in your 
career. 
	
By exploring these topics from several perspectives, you can pick up nuances 
and facts that strengthen your knowledge. Repetition is also a handy way to 
commit these topics to memory so that when others discuss them, you can 
follow the conversation and contribute in a meaningful way.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	National Geographic’s Environment site has an in-depth section on global 
warming that includes discussions about its causes, effects, and solutions, 
plus science and alternative energy sources: http://environment.
nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming.
	
✓	The Natural Resources Defense Council provides a detailed Q&A on Global 
Warming Basics (www.nrdc.org/globalWarming/f101.asp) and a five-
step plan to solve global warming (www.nrdc.org/globalWarming).
	
✓	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National 
Weather Service has produced an informative two-page brochure on cli­
mate change that addresses natural climate fluctuations as well as those 
influenced by human activity on the planet: www.weather.gov/om/
brochures/climate/Climatechange.pdf.
With a firm foundation of the basic issues under your belt, take the next step 
to discover how these issues are impacting different regions of the U.S. and 
the world. With this information, you may be able to discover a specific need 
that must be addressed in your area.
	
✓	The United States Global Change Research Program spotlights the key 
climate change issues and illustrates their impact on each region of the 
country and each sector of the economy. When you land on the home 
page, scroll down to the map to explore the impact of global changes on 
your region (www.globalchange.gov). 
	
✓	In the book Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution and 
How It Can Renew America, Thomas Friedman offers his perspective of 
how global warming issues (hot) interact with two other major trends 
(flat and crowded) to create a massive opportunity and need for innova­
tion and a new way of doing business. This book will give you an appre­
ciation of the global nature of the problem.
Tracking Legislative Actions 
As you prepare to shift into a green career or manage your current one, you 
must keep your finger on the pulse of the green economy. With new policies, 
treaties, incentives, disincentives, and funding sources coming into play, the 
green economy is evolving each and every week. 
Although it’s easy to get complacent and believe that we’ve reached a 
status quo with all things green, that’s not true. The factors shaping the new 
economy have the capacity to bring growth or contraction with the flick of a 
pen. To have a handle on your target industry, and more important your job 
status, you must invest time each week in tracking major developments. 

311
 Chapter 21: Ten Great Green Career Resources
	
✓	On Green Career Central I’ve created a Green Economy Timeline (www.
greencareercentral.com/greeneconomy) to illustrate major devel­
opments defining the new economy. 
	
✓	Green For All (www.greenforall.org) tracks green collar develop­
ments, from legislation to regional programs. This grass-roots movement 
has quite a bit of clout on Capitol Hill, so this site is a good one to find up-
to-the minute actions you can take to move the green economy forward. 
	
✓	The Apollo Alliance (www.apolloalliance.org) is a coalition that 
is working to bring about a clean energy revolution that creates green 
collar jobs for millions of Americans. A wide range of leaders contribute 
to the efforts of this organization. Visit this site to track legislative devel­
opments relevant to clean energy and green collar jobs. 
	
Your professional association is another important source of news related to 
your field. When asked to take action on pending legislation, do it!
Following Green Economy Developments
In addition to following legislative actions, you also want to be aware of finan­
cial investment trends. The old adage, follow the money, definitely applies in 
the green economy. Understanding which industries and organizations are 
receiving money helps you ascertain where to focus. 
	
✓	Recovery.gov (www.recovery.gov) is the U.S. government’s Web site 
to track where the funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment 
Act of 2009 are landing. With a simple click you can slice the allocated 
funds by region, department, and category. Keep drilling down to reach 
the Web sites for each program.
	
✓	Recovery.org (www.recovery.org) is a private venture that illustrates 
where the recovery funds are heading in even more detail. By clicking your 
state on the home page map, you can see which projects in which counties 
are receiving funds. The panels on the home page direct you to the most 
recent projects, the most talked about projects, and recent news. 
	
✓	The Green Career Central Blog (www.greencareercentralblog.
com) runs two standard posts each week. The Follow the Green Money 
post highlights several projects that have recently received funding. The 
Green Career Trends post describes innovations, discoveries, technolog­
ical advances, and industry trends that are likely to impact the careers 
in the green economy.
One final component of the green economy’s progress is tracking how green 
green businesses really are. GreenBiz.com (www.greenbiz.com) publishes 

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
an annual State of Green Business Report that evaluates whether green busi­
nesses are, in fact, solidly green. One of the most interesting discoveries to 
date is how poorly our nation’s statistics are designed to track green devel­
opments. This report shows what’s changing and what’s not. You may also 
find gaps that are begging for a solid, well-crafted solution. Perhaps you are 
the person who is meant to contribute it?
Scanning for Innovation
If you’re inspired and motivated by the discoveries and innovations of 
others, use these sites as your muse. Set aside some time to explore these 
sites in detail. Clear your calendar. Although you may have a specific interest 
you want to explore, you can also use these sites to expand your vision of 
what’s possible and discover what is happening right now.
	
✓	TED (www.ted.com) started out as a by-invitation-only conference 
where people from technology, entertainment, and design came 
together to share ideas. Now, thanks to technology, these presentations 
are readily available to all. Hover over the thumbnails on the home page 
until you find something that intrigues you. Click, listen, and be amazed!
	
✓	Planet Green (http://planetgreen.discovery.com/tv) and the 
Science Channel (http://science.discovery.com) are adding more 
and more programming about green, sustainable, and eco innovations. 
Check your local listings to discover what’s available in your area. 
	
✓	GreenBiz.com (www.greenbiz.com/browse/design-innovation) 
reports on innovative designs that bring environmental elements into the 
mix. Whether they’re exploring the bio-inspired designs of biomimicry or 
the non-toxic creations of green chemistry, new ideas are sprouting. 
	
As you explore new ideas, always dedicate a part of your mind to looking for­
ward. How can you take what you witness and move it to the next level? How 
might you contribute to bring these innovations into the mainstream conscious­
ness? When you experience the flash of an idea, record it immediately in a place 
you’ll know to return to. A new vision may come to you all at once or you may 
collect clues from several places before you see the threads of connection. Just 
one new idea may be the spark you need to point your career in a new direction. 
Grasping Green Business Concepts 
To thrive in the new economy, it’s essential that you familiarize yourself 
with the issues businesses are facing as they strive to become more sustain­
able and environmentally friendly. The following best-selling books provide 
descriptions and background information about key sustainability concepts:

Refer to Sierra Club’s blog (www.sierraclub.typepad.com) for a list of 
environmental, sustainable, and green book titles. Enter book roundup in the 
search engine to pull up hundreds of fascinating green titles. 
Searching for Green Information 
With the green economy evolving as it is, it’s important to know how to find 
the latest information about topics that are of interest to you. Starting out, 
you use these tools to explore your target industries, green concepts, and 
more. Later, as you develop in your green career, you’ll also rely on research 
to stay up-to-date in your field.
Use the following tools to gather information and additional resources per­
taining to your target green industry and career: 
	
✓	Wikipedia: If you’re just starting your search for a green career, you 
may find it beneficial to read up on a topic or industry to get an over­
view before you begin your research in earnest. Wikipedia is a perfect 
tool for this application. Enter your “keyword” + Wikipedia into your 
search engine to find a general description of your topic. In addition to 
a definition, you may also discover an outline that describes the entire 
field, links to other pages of interest, key issues relevant to your topic, 
a historical background, and more. Using Wikipedia as a starting point 
for your research saves you time by helping you grasp the picture of the 
entire field in just a few minutes. From there you can drill down to dis­
cover the specific areas you want to research on other sources.
	
✓	Google: As you seek to understand green concepts, explore green 
industries, identify potential job titles, and find green companies, you’ll 
discover Google is one of your best research tools. To make the most of 
your searches, enter your keyword into the search engine and then use a 
+ sign to add a qualifier. For example, you might enter “sustainability” + 
jobs or “solar manufacturing” + companies. The more specific your 

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
keywords, the more useful your results become. Refer to Chapter 14 for 
instructions and specific examples of this strategy. 
	
✓	Green industry profiles: Use the descriptions of green industries in 
Chapters 7 through 13 of this book as a jumping-off point for your own 
green industry exploration. Green Career Central (www.greencareer
central.com/updates) provides updated information about the 
industries profiled in this book. Additional information about each 
industry is also available to members of the site, including links to con­
ferences, job boards, news, education, glossaries, and keywords. 
Identifying Green Networking Hubs
One of the most effective ways to move your green career forward isto build 
a strong green network. Connecting with people in your local area who are 
committed to sustainability and community action puts you in touch with a 
network of people who share your values and intentions. 
Use the following resources to find green organizations in your area:
	
✓	Green teams: Communities around the country are forming to help 
cities make greener decisions and implement more sustainable pro­
grams. Check with your city hall. You may discover a city-appointed 
commission, city-sanctioned community organization, or grass-roots 
effort. As soon as you connect with the organization, start talking with 
the team members to figure out what role you can play. 
	
✓	Cool Cities Teams: If you want to play a role in urging your community 
to take greener actions, take a look at Sierra Club’s Cool Cities initiative. 
Use this map (www.coolcities.us) to find a Cool Cities group in your 
region of the United States or Canada. 
	
✓	Environmental organizations: Use an online search, your local newspa­
per, or existing contacts to identify environmental organizations in your 
area. Depending on your community, you may find ways to volunteer 
at an organic farmers market, a land restoration project, a Habitat for 
Humanity effort, a wildlife conservation program, or a recycling educa­
tion campaign. Find opportunities that fit your interests.
	
✓	Professional networking groups: Check out Eco Tuesdays (www.
EcoTuesday.com), Green Drinks (www.greendrinks.org), and Net 
Impact (www.netimpact.org) for networking gatherings in your area. 
	
In your efforts to connect with people in person, don’t forget the value of 
building a green online network as well. Search the list of LinkedIn Groups 
(www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory) or follow people talking about 
your target industry on Twitter. See Chapter 15 for more information.

 Chapter 21: Ten Great Green Career Resources
Finding Green Companies
Identifying the companies and organizations that match your values is a criti­
cal part of your job search. Finding a list of companies that fits a particular 
criterion can be a great tool in locating companies you want to target. 
	
✓	Association membership lists: On occasion, you’ll find that an associa­
tion lists its members on its Web site. Use that list as a starting point for 
your own research. For example, Social Venture Network (www.svn.
org) provides a list of the socially responsible companies their mem­
bers lead. Click the People link to find the list. 
	
✓	Lists of companies doing great work: Books and Web sites often list 
companies who are doing extraordinary work in a particular area. For 
example, the Vault Guide to Green Programs (www.vault.com, click 
Store, and then click Career Topic Guides) highlights by name com­
panies that have added green initiatives to their business plans. The 
book Green to Gold: How Smart Companies Use Environmental Strategy to 
Innovate, Create Value, and Build Competitive Advantage lists 50 national 
and international companies that are incorporating environmental strat­
egies into their business initiatives. 
	
✓	Ratings of companies on green dimensions: As the green economy 
develops, more watchdog groups and research organizations are evalu­
ating companies on their green practices. Climate Counts (www.climate
counts.org/scorecard_overview.php) offers a score card on com­
panies in various sectors of the economy. With a simple icon system, 
you can see whether a company is making strides, just starting out, or 
stuck when it comes to green initiatives. 
See Chapters 18 and 19 for specific tips on researching companies and find­
ing openings online and in your local region. 
Staying Motivated and Entertained
Do you ever need an inspirational boost to remind you why you want to help 
the green movement through your profession? If so, use the following links to 
find movies and online videos that can snap you out of yourcomplacency: 
	
✓	The Story of Stuff (www.storyofstuff.com) is an 20-minute online 
video that shows you where our stuff comes from and where it goes 
after we throw it away. It will forever change how you look at the stuff 
you buy and, more important, the stuff you toss.

Ten Ways to Green 
Your Current Job
In This Chapter
▶	Using your resources wisely
▶	Amping up your energy efficiency
▶	Minimizing your transportation costs
M
aking a green stand with your work doesn’t necessarily mean you 
must change careers immediately. Greening the job you have now is a 
great place to start. In the process of making your job more sustainable, you 
deepen your connection with coworkers who share your values and green 
your resume. 
	
Christine, a Sun Microsystems employee, took it upon herself to volunteer 
within her company to learn as much as she could about sustainability. The 
tasks she did outside of her official job helped the company prepare for the 
launch of their first green server. Volunteering on the green team gave her an 
opportunity to work with managers who were instrumental in bringing sus­
tainability to the company. When an Eco-Responsibility Marketing Manager 
position was created, guess where management turned to fill it? 
Use the strategies in this chapter to find ways to help your company become 
more sustainable. Some tips are actions you can take on your own. Others are 
strategies for stepping into a leadership role in transforming your company.
Minimizing the Paper You Use
How many pages do you print each day? Do you have any idea? Keep track 
of the amount of office paper (printing, copying, writing) you use for the next 
week and then estimate the amount of paper you use each year. I suspect you 
will be startled by the results. 

318
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
According to GreenPrint (www.printgreener.com/earthday.html), the 
average U.S. office worker prints 10,000 pages per year. When put together, 
the amount of paper Americans use each year is enough to build a 10-foot-
high wall that’s 6,815 miles long. Consumption of global paper products has 
grown as well, tripling over the past three decades. 
To understand the true environmental impact of the paper you use, check 
out the Paper Calculator by the Environmental Defense Fund (www.edf.
org/papercalculator). After inputting the kind of paper and the amount 
of paper you use, click calculate to discover the impact different kinds of 
paper have on the environment in terms of the amount of wood and energy 
used to produce it and the amount of greenhouse gases, wastewater, and 
solid waste that result from its production. 
Just to give you some perspective, Conservatree (www.conservatree.org) 
reports that it takes one tree to make 16.67 reams of copy paper or 8,333 
sheets. Ninety percent of printing and writing paper is still made from virgin 
materials rather than recycled materials.
Here are some strategies to reduce the paper you use in your office: 
	
✓	Don’t print. This is your best option. If you need to share a document, 
save a copy on a shared drive or send it to people electronically. 
	
✓	Reduce the amount you print. Instead of printing a copy of a docu­
ment for everyone in your office, circulate one copy of the materials for 
review. Encourage centralized filing or online filing so there is no need 
to print multiple copies for filing. 
	
✓	Use double-sided printing. If you must print a report, use double-sided 
printing to halve the number of pages. 
	
✓	Use recycled paper. Purchasing recycled paper can also make a tremen­
dous difference. See this online brochure for more facts: www.conserva
tree.com/paper/PaperTypes/RecyBrochure.shtml.
After printed materials are used, dispose of them properly. Reuse the paper 
to create notepads or packing materials. If reuse isn’t feasible, recycle. 
According toTreeCycle.com (www.treecycle.com) producing recycled 
paper uses 60–70 percent less energy and 55 percent less water than making 
paper from virgin pulp. Furthermore, making recycled paper reduces water 
pollution by 35 percent and reduces air pollution by 74 percent.
Recycling Electronic Waste
According to the Environmental Protection Agency (www.epa.gov/waste/
conserve/materials/ecycling/index.htm), the United States disposed 
of 2.5 million tons of electronic waste in 2007. Only 18 percent of it was recycled.

 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Green Your Current Job
Electronic waste, or e-waste, is discarded TVs, computers, monitors, print­
ers, scanners, mice, keyboards, and cellphones. 
Putting electronic devices into landfill is bad for the following reasons: 
	
✓	Hazardous materials and chemicals are dangerous. When electronic 
equipment ends up in landfill, the lead, mercury, brominated flame 
retardants, and cadmium get into nearby waterways and soil.
	
✓	Precious metals and electronic materials are valuable resources. When 
these precious materials go to landfill, we lose access to them. Consider 
the impact this can have. If we recycled 100 million cellphones, we could 
recover 3.4 metric tons of gold and avoid disrupting 5.5 million tons of 
soil, sand, and rock to mine that much new gold. 
	
✓	Creating brand-new devices uses tremendous amounts of energy. 
According to the EPA, if 100 million cellphones were recycled instead of 
thrown away, we would be able to save enough energy to provide elec­
tricity to approximately 19,500 U.S. households for one year.
When you have e-waste to dispose of in your workplace, you have several 
options. Begin by exploring ways to donate your old equipment to schools or 
nonprofits in your area. If your equipment is too old or if you have data secu­
rity concerns, recycling is probably your next best choice. Look into take-back 
programs and recycling events sponsored by companies that produce elec­
tronics. To find an e-waste recycler in your area, check out www.electronics
recycling.org.
Leading Your Company’s 
Recycling Efforts 
If your company doesn’t have a recycling program in place, you may have 
a golden opportunity to take the initiative to implement a program that will 
save your company money and lighten the load on your local landfill. 
The best way to get started is to do a Web search, using the terms how to 
start recycling program at work with the name of your city. The search 
results will include recycling resources and organizations that are available 
in your area. You’ll likely find effective collateral and recycling programs that 
are ready to implement in your company. (If you don’t find what you’re look­
ing for in your search, try the name of your region or state.)
Think it’s a little strange to spend your time disposing of other people’s 
waste? Well, if you get the recycling program off the ground at your current 
employer, you never know how that success will bolster your career path.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
Shortly after being hired as a part-time recycling assistant, Cheri Chastain was 
promoted to full-time Environmental Sustainability Coordinator at Sierra Nevada 
Brewery (www.sierranevada.com). How did she do it? After tracking the com­
pany’s recycling efforts as an assistant, she used the data to identify opportuni­
ties that would improve the company’s environmental impact and bottom line. 
In 2007 it recycled about 31,000 tons of material — saving $3 million dollars in 
charges from the waste hauler and the landfill — and earned more than $800,000 
from selling excess materials. Cheri now reports to the owner of the company, 
and her responsibilities extend far beyond recycling; to include tracking green­
house gas emissions, creating renewable energy sources, setting up composting 
projects, enhancing energy efficiency, conserving water, and more. (To hear 
Cheri talk about her green job, visit www.greenbiz.com/podcast/2008/04/
14/from-suds-solar-the-greening-sierra-nevada-brewing-co.
Influencing Your Company’s 
Purchasing Policies
Rather than focusing on how to dispose of waste, this greening strategy shifts 
the emphasis to which products are purchased in the first place. By setting 
up environmentally preferable purchasing or procurement policies, your 
company becomes more strategic about what products it buys.
The key purpose of a procurement policy is to minimize the negative impact 
on the environment by reducing toxicity, conserving energy, materials, and 
natural resources, increasing the use of recycled content, and maximizing the 
opportunity to recycle items at the end of their life cycles.
Although they appear straightforward, creating and implementing policies 
take time and commitment. Familiarize yourself with the following concepts 
to get a sense of the complexity of this crucial process:
	
✓	Environmentally preferable products and services: To determine 
whether a product or service is environmentally preferable, you must 
consider the raw materials and how they are acquired, the production 
or manufacturing process, the packaging, the distribution channels, how 
the product is used and maintained, whether the product is reusable, 
and how it is disposed of.
	
✓	Life cycle cost: Considering how much a product costs to purchase isn’t 
the whole story. The life cycle cost must factor in the annual cost of a 
product, including the cost of installing, operating, maintaining, and dis­
posing of it. 
	
✓	Recyclable product: A product with this designation can be reused as 
a raw material in the manufacturing process for another product rather 
than going to landfill.

321
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Green Your Current Job
	
✓	Recycled material: A recycled resource is a material that has been 
diverted from solid waste and used in place of virgin material in manu­
facturing a product. This material can be made from post-consumer 
recycled material, manufacturing waste, industrial scrap, or agricultural 
waste. Recycled materials cannot, however, contain byproducts gener­
ated from an original manufacturing process, which is a sneaky tactic 
some companies use to claim a product is recycled. 
By encouraging the purchase of environmentally preferred products, your 
company is helping to build a market for products that are recycled, eco-
labeled, and environmentally friendly. 
Moving toward More Sustainable 
Promotional Items 
Most companies use promotional items to keep the company in front of its 
target customers. Unfortunately the entire life cycle of your typical promo­
tional tchotchkes isn’t very sustainable. From production to distribution, 
inordinate amounts of energy, raw resources, and fuel are consumed. In the 
end, most of them end up in the trash. 
What do you know about the promotional items your company uses? Use the 
following questions to evaluate your company’s promotional items: 
	
✓	How are the promotional items manufactured? How much energy is 
used? What energy source is used?
	
✓	What kind of materials are used in the item? Are any of them hazardous? 
Are the materials sustainable, organic, recycled, or reused?
	
✓	How much does it cost to transport the promotional items from the 
manufacturer to you? What kind of carbon footprint does this transpor­
tation create? How about from you to your prospects? Are there any 
locally produced items you could use to avoid the cost and emissions of 
transporting items long distance?
	
✓	Do your prospects really want the promotional items your company 
offers? Will they keep them or send them straight to landfill? 
	
✓	Are the promotional items recyclable or biodegradable?
Are the items portraying the right image of your company? Perhaps this is an 
opportunity for you to do some research and find solutions that fit the com­
pany budget while enhancing the company’s image in your community. 

322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Encouraging Your Company 
to Do an Energy Audit
Time magazine says that “heating, cooling, and powering office space are 
responsible for almost 40 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the U.S. 
and gobble more than 70 percent of total electricity usage.” (“Going Green 
at the Office,” June 7, 2007, www.time.com/time/magazine/article/
0,9171,1630552,00.html).
One of the most efficient ways to cut business costs is to do an energy audit. 
Check with your local utility company to determine whether they offer any 
auditing services. Often the utility will conduct the audit and produce a 
report for free. The report will likely tell you which areas of the company use 
the most energy. You may discover how much the company pays for energy 
leaks, inefficient lighting, and poor heating and cooling systems. Knowing 
these numbers makes it much easier to invest in repairs and efficiency 
upgrades. Calculating the return on investment is usually easy and fast. 
During the audit, ask the utility representative about rebates and tax credits 
available through the utility, your local government, or the federal government. 
These rebates and tax credits may make energy retrofitting more affordable 
than you or your managers think is possible. 
Persuading Your Company to Turn off 
Electronic Equipment at Night
Did you know that powering PCs and monitors accounts for 39 percent of the 
information and telecommunications industry’s emissions — equal to a full 
year of CO2 emissions from approximately 43.9 million cars? According to the 
2009 US PC Energy Report recently published by 1E (http://www.1e.com/
energycampaign/), U.S. companies could save over $2.8 billion by turning 
off unused PCs overnight. 
In the early days of computers it was thought that keeping computers on 
all the time caused less wear and tear on the systems and prevented costly 
repairs. Now, however, keeping computers running is just plain costly. If your 
company wants to cut costs and use less energy, do the math (using this 
handy calculator: www.1e.com/energycampaign/calculation.aspx) 
to determine the savings. If the company closes over the holidays, there’s 
another opportunity to save some cash. A solid business case may be all it 
takes to shift management’s view on the situation. If you need a compelling 

323
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Green Your Current Job
example to include in your report, consider this statement from 1E’s 2009 US 
PC Energy Report: “If all the world’s 1 billion PC’s were powered down for just 
one night it would save enough energy to light up New York City’s Empire 
State Building — inside and out — for more than 30 years.” 
Traveling Wisely
National Business Travelers Association (www.nbta.org) claims U.S. busi­
ness travelers rack up 240 billion miles annually. According to Trees for the 
Future (www.plant-trees.org), a carbon offset company, jets typically 
emit about one pound of carbon dioxide per passenger mile. Therefore, 240 
billion miles of air travel translates into 1.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 
our air (http://www.greenbiz.com/research/report/2002/08/13/
environmentally-responsible-business-travel).
Consider one of the following eco-friendly (and time-friendly) alternatives 
next time you need to book a long-distance flight for a business meeting:
	
✓	Videoconferencing: If you’re the only one traveling to another office 
location for a meeting, find out about videoconferencing capabilities. 
You may be able to meet face to face without leaving your office. 
	
✓	Webinars: Another alternative is to set up a webinar. This option can be 
helpful if you’re meeting with people in multiple locations. Sign everyone 
up for a webinar by using interfaces such as Go to Meeting (www.goto
meeting.com). You can all converse while seeing the presentation or 
meeting materials on your screens. 
	
✓	Skype: This option is perfect if you work with offices in other parts of 
the world. Meeting participants can enjoy free video and voice calls, 
chat, and share files with other Skype users (www.skype.com).
If you absolutely must travel to meet your business goals or attend a confer­
ence, pay attention to airlines who are working to green their airplanes (www.
seatguru.com/articles/green_aircraft_and_airlines.php) or 
purchase carbon offsets for your flight. 
Commuting Creatively
Business travel is just one part of the work-related transportation equation. 
Commuting is another. Instead of driving to work alone, consider whether 
any of the following commute alternatives work for you: 

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
✓	Carpooling: Can you connect with others who drive to your office or a 
nearby office each day?
	
✓	Public transit options: Depending on where you live, you may be able 
to take public transit to work. A side benefit is time to read or listen to 
music, podcasts, or audio books.
	
✓	Walk or bike: These alternatives are best if you live close to work or 
you can combine this method with a transit option. With this option, 
exercise becomes integrated into your day. 
	
✓	Work from home: Even if you can’t work from home every day, you may 
be able to negotiate a work-from-home day or two per week. 
Rethinking Shipping and Packaging
Moving products and supplies to and from your office has a profound impact 
on the planet. This carbon calculator can tell you how much carbon is pro­
duced by shipping packages: www.fgx.com/tools/carbon-calculator/. 
As you reevaluate your shipping department standards, consider the following 
components of the shipping equation: 
	
✓	Packaging: Whenever possible reuse packing materials such as boxes, 
bubble wrap, and peanuts. Or use items that are readily available such 
as newspaper. If you must purchase new packing materials, search for 
biodegradable or post-consumer recycled packing materials. If your 
company is willing to spend a bit more, buy packing peanuts made from 
corn starch that dissolve in water. If you must ship with Styrofoam 
forms, ask your customers to ship them back to you for reuse. 
	
✓	Choose ground shipping: Although it requires more planning, shipping 
by ground costs less and emits eight times less carbon than air travel 
(http://green.yahoo.com/blog/the_conscious_consumer/18/
greener-shipping-options.html).
	
✓	Shipping route: Most shipping companies use a hub and spoke system 
to move packages. Although this strategy creates economies of scale, 
it’s not the most environmentally efficient way to move packages. FGX 
(www.fgxusa.com), a greener shipping company, sends packages 
directly to overseas destinations without using out-of-the-way hubs, 
creating less carbon emissions, more cost savings, and faster deliveries.
