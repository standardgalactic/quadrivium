Thanks to everyone who supported me in this effort. Special thanks to those of
you who stood by me to ensure that the “right thing” happened—you know
who you are. This book represents a second chance for me, to believe that there
are honest people in the world, and that a man’s word still does mean some-
thing. In the end, truth will remain, all else will fall away. The team of folks that
helped pull this together worked very hard and I am certain they will all go far.
There is no shame in not knowing; the shame lies in not finding out.
—Mark Brown
I dedicate this book to my wife, Vriti, who encouraged me to write.
—Sam Patadia
I would like to dedicate this book to my wife, Anu, and kids, Archit, Arpit &
Ankit, for their love and support over the years. And to my parents, thank you.
None of this would have been possible without your love, guidance, and care.

Check-In
May I See Your Passport?
What do you mean you don’t have a passport? Why, it’s sitting right in your
hands,even as you read! This book is your passport to a very special place.You’re
about to begin a journey, my friend, a journey toward that magical place called
certification! You don’t need a ticket, you don’t need a suitcase—just snuggle up
and read this passport—it’s all you need to get there. Are you ready? Let’s go!
Your Travel Agent: Mike Meyers
Hello! I’m Mike Meyers, president of Total Seminars and author of a number of
popular certification books. On any given day, you’ll find me replacing a hard
drive, setting up a Web site, or writing code. I love every aspect of this book you
hold in your hands. It’s part of a powerful new book series called the Mike
Meyer’s Certification Passports. Every book in this series combines easy read-
ability with a condensed format—in other words, it’s the kind of book I always
wanted when I went for my certifications. Putting a huge amount of informa-
tion in an accessible format is an enormous challenge, but I think we have
achieved our goal and I am confident you’ll agree.
I designed this series to do one thing and only one thing—to get you the in-
formation you need to achieve your certification. You won’t find any fluff in
here. The authors pack every page with nothing but the real nitty gritty of the
RFID+ Certification exam. Every page has 100 percent pure concentrate of cer-
tification knowledge! But we didn’t forget to make the book readable, so I hope
you enjoy the casual, friendly style.

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology belongs to a broader group
of technologies known as Auto Identification (Auto-ID). This chapter will take a
brief look at some of the Auto-ID technologies and will introduce RFID technol-
ogy,define some basic RFID terminology,review a brief history of RFID,discuss
organizations that create RFID standards, and provide a few examples of sys-
tems using RFID technology.
Objective 1.1
Auto-ID Technologies
A
n Auto-ID technology is anything that collects data about the objects and
enters that data into a database without human intervention. Auto-ID
technologies are everywhere, quietly and efficiently doing thousands of mun-
dane jobs. The one big job where Auto-ID makes a natural fit is in answering
some of the big questions of commerce: “What is it?”, “Where is it?”, and “What
about it?”—primarily the identification and tracking of boxes, people, animals,
you name it! Compared to humans, Auto-ID technologies identify and track
faster, more accurately, and at a reduced overall cost. RFID is only one of many
types of Auto-ID technologies. Other Auto-ID technologies include Magnetic
Ink Character Recognition (MICR), magnetic strip, voice recognition,
biometrics, and barcodes.
MICR reads ink-printed characters, such as those that often appear at the
bottom of personal checks.The checks must be properly oriented and presented
to the MICR reader one at a time. Magnetic strips are used on credit and debit
cards and also require a proper orientation and physical contact between
the card and the reader. Barcodes consist of a series of black bars and white
spaces of varying widths. Several hundred different types of barcodes are used,
with the most common being the Uniform Product Code (UPC), which is used
extensively by the retail industry. Barcodes require a line of sight and proper
orientation of the barcodes relative to the scanner. Voice recognition is used by
order-picking applications in distribution centers (DCs).In order picking,voice
recognition has a big advantage over barcode identification.It allows hands-free
and eyes-free order picking and does not require alignment of labels to readers.
Biometrics, such as fingerprint and retinal scans, are used to identify people.
Many of the latest computers use fingerprints to identify the user. In many
highly secured locations, entry permits are granted using retinal scans. Retinal
scanning has also been used to identify cattle.

So, with all these Auto-ID technologies, why should yet another technology
like RFID suddenly become so popular? It all boils down to one thing: radio
waves. RFID encompasses technologies that use electromagnetic (radio) waves,
part of electromagnetic spectrum, to identify individual items, places, animals,
or people.RFID can be appropriately implemented for many different uses. The
most common is to use an identifying number (sort of a name) that uniquely
identifies an object, place, animal, or person. The number is stored on an inte-
grated circuit (IC) that is attached to an antenna. Together, the IC and the an-
tenna are called an RFID transponder or tag. The tag is attached to the object,
place, animal, or person to be identified. A device called the interrogator or
reader communicates with the tag and is used to read the identifying number
from the tag. The reader feeds the number it reads into an information system,
which stores the number in its database or searches its database for the number
and returns information stored therein about the object, place, animal, or per-
son. The major difference between various Auto-ID technologies is in how the
identifying number is stored and retrieved.
Travel Advisory
Almost all RFID interrogators, though they are called readers, also
write data to the tag.
Among the Auto-ID technologies mentioned so far, the barcode is closest to
RFID; therefore, the two technologies are compared here to help you under-
stand their relative advantages and disadvantages. Two major types of barcodes
are linear and matrix.
Linear barcodes use black-and-white stripes of different width to encode a
number, while matrix barcodes use two-dimensional arrays of black-and-white
patches to encode information. A scanner using a laser reads the information
encoded in barcodes and provides it to the information system.
RFID is not necessarily “better”than barcode. The two are different technolo-
gies that have different, yet sometimes overlapping, applications. The big differ-
ence between the two is that barcodes require a line-of-sight,while RFID does not.
A barcode scanner has to “see”the barcode to read it,but the RFID reader can read
the tag while it is optically hidden.The barcode also needs to be properly oriented
toward a scanner for it to be read.RFID tags can be read as long as they are within
the range of a reader, regardless of their orientation.
CHAPTER 1 RFID Basics

Barcodes have other shortcomings.If a label is ripped or soiled,the item can-
not be scanned. Standard barcodes identify only the manufacturer and product,
not the unique item.So,for example,the barcode on one juice carton is the same
as every other, making it impossible to identify which one might pass its expira-
tion date first. Many people think that RFID will replace barcodes, but if this
happens,it will take several years since barcodes is a mature technology and cur-
rently has a very low cost of implementation compared to RFID.
Table 1-1 lists advantages and disadvantages of RFID and barcode.
Objective 1.2
Brief History of RFID
R
FID is called a new technology, but it is actually older than barcodes. The
technology that forms the basis for RFID was first developed during World
War II to identify airplanes. At that time it was called friend-or-foe technology,
and a greatly modernized version is still used in aircraft identification today.
Barcodes were invented in the late 1940s but did not see substantial use until the

late 1960s and early 1970s. However, barcode’s low price compared to RFID
made it a much more attractive option for Auto-ID usage at that time. Well, at
least if you were not trying to identify an airplane! But, as the cost of RFID
slowly dropped, industry began to use it for more applications. Since 1979,
RFID has been in use to identify and track animals. In 1994, all rail cars in the
United States used RFID tags for identification. A recent surge has occurred
in RFID technology research, manufacturing, and usage due to the advances in
semiconductor manufacturing, which has reduced the cost of RFID, making
their use economically feasible in supply-chain and other applications where
tags are attached to objects not normally returned to the manufacturer.
RFID systems in the past used proprietary technologies; no worldwide open
standards existed. There was little or no interconnectivity between different
RFID vendor’s products. Every vendor had their own readers, tags, signals, and
equipment—and nothing worked together.This lack of interoperability made it
challenging for companies to adopt RFID and constrained the deployment of
RFID technology in the global supply chain. However, that problem is quickly
disappearing due to new standards. Since 2006, many international and indus-
try organizations have created open standards. RFID equipment manufacturers
have started selling tags and readers that conform to these new standards,result-
ing in an increase in the supply and a reduction in the price of RFID devices,
which in turn has accelerated RFID technology adoption.

RFID Systems
R
FID may only consist of a tag and a reader but an RFID system comprises
many other technologies, such as computer, network, Internet, wireless
devices, and software, all working with the RFID devices to create a complete
solution. A typical RFID system is divided into two layers: the physical layer
and Information Technology (IT) layer.
The physical layer consists of the following:
•
One or more RF tags
•
One or more interrogators (readers)
•
One or more reader antennas
•
Deployment environment
The IT layer consists of the following:
•
One or more host computers connected to readers (directly or through
a network)
•
Appropriate software (device drivers, filters, middleware, databases,
and user applications)
Figure 1-1 provides a bird’s-eye view of the RFID system, showing tags,
readers, network, computers with software applications, and people all inter-
acting to monitor and control business processes. The bidirectional mode of

Bird’s-eye view of an RFID system

data movement among various parts of the RFID system is depicted at the bot-
tom of the figure. Data may be read from or written to the tag during a busi-
ness process. For example, a number may be read from the tag attached to a
case of goods passing through the shipping dock, while data may be written to
the tag attached to a part moving from one workstation to the other during the
manufacturing process.
Figure 1-2 shows the physical layer of an RFID system: a tag, an antenna, a
reader, and the deployment environment. The deployment environment con-
sists of an interrogation zone (IZ)—the space in which a reader antenna emits
radio waves through which the tags pass—and objects in the vicinity of the IZ.
The deployment environment is included in the physical layer because the
performance of the RFID reader and tag is greatly affected by various charac-
teristics of the deployment environment. The radio frequency interference
within the deployment space and type, size, and shape of objects located
within the deployment space affect the read performance of tags.
All RFID systems require IT layer components. The IT layer consists of vari-
ous computer systems, networks, databases, and application software. RFID
software is divided into two groups: middleware and enterprise applications.
Middleware directly interacts with the RFID physical layer, collects data from
readers, attaches business process information to data, stores data, and supplies
data to enterprise applications in their native formats. It also manages, moni-
tors, and configures hardware. Middleware forms a conduit between the enter-
prise applications used to manage business processes and hardware
components. Enterprise applications, also called business applications, use
middleware to gather data from RFID readers. This data is then used to manage
business. For example, data received from RFID readers at shipping dock may
be used to create invoices and bill customers.

Exam Tip
The CompTIA RFID+ Certification Exam includes only the physical layer
of the RFID technology. Therefore, only the physical components of the
RFID system are discussed in this book.
Many varieties of RFID tags, readers, and antennas are available on the mar-
ket.The RFID system designer selects them according to the requirements of the
objects to be tagged, the distance at which the tags are to be read, the business
processes during which tags are read,the speed of the tagged objects through the
IZ, and the number of tags in the IZ. RFID tags come in many different shapes
and sizes, operate at different frequencies, use different protocols, obtain power
from different sources, can be written to once or several times, and currently
cost anywhere from ten cents to several dollars. RFID readers are designed to
operate at different frequencies,protocols,and power levels.RFID antennas also
come in different sizes, shapes, frequencies, and with different radiation pat-
terns. All of these aspects are discussed in detail in the chapters that follow.
Objective 1.4
RFID Standards
and Regulations
T
o be widely accepted, any technology requires some sort of standards and
regulations that provide guidelines for designing, manufacturing, and us-
ing the technology. Standards are created by industry consortiums such as
EPCglobal or standards-creating organizations such as the International Orga-
nization for Standardization (ISO). Standards help provide interoperability
among vendors’ products, increased demand for products, and reduced costs.
Regulations are created by governmental agencies and help improve safety of
the technology and create an orderly development and deployment environ-
ment in which several similar technologies can operate simultaneously.
Two standards developing organizations most instrumental in getting differ-
ent RFID solutions to work together are EPCglobal and ISO. EPCglobal is a
not-for-profit industry organization. The acronym EPC stands for Electronic
Product Code. Some of the standards developed by EPCglobal include Gen 2 (or
Generation 2) and ALE (Application Level Events). The Gen 2 standard defines

rules for communication between the tag and the reader, while the ALE stan-
dard defines rules for data collection and filtering and reader management and
monitoring. ISO has approved the Gen 2 standard as ISO 18000-6C. EPCglobal
is currently working on development of the EPCglobal network,which will pro-
vide a standardized way to collect, store, and distribute data among various or-
ganizations in the supply chain.
Objective 1.5
Benefits of RFID
O
ne of the benefits of the RFID system is reduced human intervention.
RFID helps collect data automatically while business processes are being
performed. No special actions are necessary to collect data. This automation
improves data quality, reduces data collection time, captures data in real-time,
and reduces costs associated with poor data quality. Time and cost savings also
occur because boxes need not be opened to scan items to collect data. Inventory
information can be collected in real-time and items can be tracked in real-time.
RFID can also be utilized to verify the origin of an item and thus help detect
counterfeit items.With the reduced cost of collecting data,businesses can afford
to collect data at more locations throughout a process. This provides finer visi-
bility in the business process, helps fine-tune the business processes, and helps
identify inventory losses due to theft and damage. You can write data to a tag so
the information travels with the item and can be used by downstream business
processes.You can also uniquely identify each instance of an item and scan mul-
tiple items at one time at a high speed, even in harsh environments.
Objective 1.6
RFID Applications

track objects,persons,or animals.A few of the examples of applications are
listed here:

Following are a few examples of RFID systems.
Building Access System
The first example is a building access system that
uses badges with an imbedded RFID tag.Many organizations use RFID-enabled
access badges. The badge contains an RFID tag on which an identifying number
is stored. When the badge holder wants to enter the protected area, he holds the
badge near a special reader near the door.The reader reads the number from the
badge and sends it to the computer system.The computer system compares that
number with the stored information and determines whether the person hold-
ing the badge has access privileges to the area. If the badge holder is allowed ac-
cess to the area, the door is unlocked.
Supply Chain System
An RFID system can also be used in a supply chain.
Consider a simple supply chain consisting of three companies: a manufacturer, a
distribution center (DC), and a retailer. The manufacturer produces some items
with attached RFID tags encoded with unique numbers. When the manufacturer

CHAPTER 1 RFID Basics
11
ships items to the DC,an RFID reader at its shipping dock automatically reads the
numbers from the tags on the items. These numbers, along with other informa-
tion such as read time and dock location, are stored in the company’s database
system. While the items are being shipped, the manufacturer sends an advance
ship notice (ASN) to the DC. The ASN contains, along with other data, a list of
numbers read from all the tags of the items shipped.
When the items arrive at the receiving dock of the DC, an RFID reader
reads the numbers from the tags attached to the items. These numbers are
compared to those on the ASN from the manufacturer. If the numbers do not
match, an exception is generated and the discrepancy is automatically re-
ported to the manufacturer and to appropriate people within the DC. If num-
bers match, the shipment is accepted. The numbers of the items received are
recorded in the DC’s database. When the DC ships the items to the retailer,
the numbers from the attached tags on the items being shipped are read at the
shipping dock door. The DC’s inventory system is updated, items shipped to
the retailer are recorded, and an ASN is sent to the retailer.
When the retailer receives the items,a process similar to the one performed at
the receiving dock of the DC is performed at the retailer’s receiving dock. Now
all three companies have complete records of what, when, and to whom items
were shipped and what, when, and from whom items were received. The manu-
facturer, if authorized by the DC and the retailer, can look in their database in-
ventory of the items it manufactured and can use that information to plan its
future manufacturing schedule and order raw materials. All three companies
can have access to all the databases and use that information for optimizing the
inventory to carry, the number of items to order, and the number of items to
manufacture. This creates an efficient supply chain and lowers the cost for all
parties involved. This data can also be used to track product quality, support
warranties, product recalls, and other information.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 1.1: Auto-ID Technologies
Auto-ID technologies such as RFID,
barcodes,MICR,magnetic strip,and biometrics are used to identify items of
interest faster, more accurately, and at reduced cost. RFID uses IC to store

data and radio waves to transmit them, while barcodes use black-and-white
stripes or patches to store data and light waves to transmit them. Both of
these technologies are very similar in use once the data is read from the data
storage medium. The differences between them are in how the data is stored
and retrieved, the amount of data that can be stored, and whether the data
can be rewritten or not.
✔Objective 1.2: Brief History of RFID
RFID technology has existed since
the 1950s and has been in use since the late 1970s. Recent advances in semi-
conductor manufacturing have reduced the cost of RFID to a point that it is
now economical to use RFID on a large scale.
✔Objective 1.3: RFID Systems
RFID systems consist of physical and IT lay-
ers. The physical layer includes RF tags, interrogators, antennas, and deploy-
ment environment, while the IT layer includes computer hardware and
software. RFID tags and readers are designed to operate at various frequen-
cies and protocols. The performance of the RFID system is affected by types
of tags, readers, and antennas used and the RF characteristics of the deploy-
ment environment.
✔Objective 1.4: RFID Standards and Regulations
EPCglobal and ISO have
recently developed standards for the design and operation of RFID devices,
such as tags and readers. The standardization has helped to accelerate the
implementation of RFID systems. All RFID systems must comply with the
government regulation in the country of use.
✔Objective 1.5: Benefits of RFID
RFID systems reduce human intervention
in the business processes and thus help improve efficiency and reduce cost.
They also provide data in real-time and help detect counterfeit items and
shrinkage.
✔Objective 1.6: RFID Applications
RFID systems can be used in any ap-
plication where an item, an animal, or a person needs to be quickly and
efficiently identified. RFID systems are used in a variety of areas, such as
manufacturing, supply chain, healthcare, library, asset tracking, and au-
tomotive.

RFID systems use radio waves to exchange information between RFID tran-
sponders, or tags, and interrogators or readers. How radio waves behave under
various conditions in the RFID interrogation zone (IZ) affects the performance
of the RFID system. Radio waves propagate from their source and reach the re-
ceiver. During their travel, they pass through different materials, encounter in-
terference from their own reflection and from other signals, and may be
absorbed or blocked by various objects in their path. The material of the object
to which the tag is attached may change the property of the tag.
To understand how all these phenomena affect the performance of the RFID
system, you need to understand how radio waves are used and propagated. The
first part of this chapter discusses how radio waves travel and how their effec-
tiveness changes during this travel. The second part discusses antennas, the de-
vices that transmit and receive the radio signals. You will study different
characteristics of an antenna such as its gain, directivity, polarization, and im-
pedance. You will also look at various types of antennas and their usage and the
types of antenna cable and connectors that are used to connect antennas to
RFID interrogators.
Objective 2.1
Radio Frequency Basics
Radio frequencies constitute a small portion of a larger electromagnetic
spectrum. The total electromagnetic spectrum includes other higher fre-
quency waves such as light, ultraviolet ray, X-ray, and gamma-ray, which are
not discussed in this book. You will study the various ways energy in the spec-
trum propagates and you will learn the various terms used in radio frequency
system design.
Electromagnetic Spectrum
In an RFID system, radio waves in a particular frequency range are used to en-
code and transfer information between an RFID interrogator(s) and each RFID
tag. The entire electromagnetic spectrum includes gamma-rays, X-rays, ultravi-
olet light, visible light, infrared light, microwaves, and radio waves. The differ-
ence between these various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum is their
wavelength, or frequency. The energy radiated by radio waves is called electro-
magnetic radiation.
16
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

A wave is a distortion in a material or medium. While the wave passes
through the material or medium, the individual parts of the material cycle back
and forth or up and down. All the waves have similar characteristics and follow
the same laws and principles. The characteristics of a waveform are wavelength,
amplitude, velocity, and frequency. All periodic waveforms have these common
characteristics.Figure 2-1 shows a wave with two complete cycles,its amplitude,
its wavelength, and points where peaks and valleys occur.
Local Lingo
Sinusoidal wave
A continuous, uniform wave with a constant
frequency and amplitude whose waveform is the same as that of a
trigonometric sine function.
The amplitude of a wave is defined as half the distance between the values at
positive and negative peaks. Amplitude relates to loudness in sound and bright-
ness in light.
The wavelength of a wave is the distance between a point on one cycle and the
identical point on the next cycle, as shown in Figure 2-1, in which points have
been selected at the crest of the wave.The typical units of measure of a wavelength
are meters or feet. Wavelength is represented by the Greek letter λ (lambda).
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
17
FIGURE 2.1
A sinusoidal wave

The frequency of waves is the number of times the identical points on the
wave, crests, or peaks, pass any fixed point during 1 second. Frequency is mea-
sured in cycles per second. Cycles per second is called Hertz (Hz) in honor of
German scientist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz. One cycle per second is equal to 1 Hz.
Frequency is represented by the letter f.
The velocity of the wave is the measure of how fast any point on the wave is
moving past a fixed point. Typical units of velocity are meters/second or miles/
second. Velocity is represented by a lowercase letter v.
The relationship between velocity, frequency, and wavelength is shown by
the following equation:
Velocity (v) = wavelength (λ) × frequency (f) or
v = λ × f
Using this equation,you can calculate frequency from wavelength or vice versa.
Now let’s go back to the electromagnetic spectrum. Figure 2-2 shows various
parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and their wavelengths. Gamma-rays are
at the top, and radio waves are at the bottom. The radio waves are further di-
vided into groups called low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), ultra high fre-
quency (UHF), and microwave. RFID technology uses radio waves within all of
these ranges.
Electromagnetic radiation can be described in terms of a stream of photons.
Photons are massless particles, each traveling in a wavelike pattern and moving
at the speed of light.Each photon contains a certain amount of energy.The only
difference between the various types of electromagnetic radiation is the amount
of energy found in the photons. Radio waves have photons with the lowest en-
ergy, microwaves have a little more energy than radio waves, infrared has still
more energy, and then visible, and then ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma-rays.
The electromagnetic spectrum can be expressed in terms of energy, frequency,
or wavelength, all of which are mathematically related. The main reason for us-
ing one of these three different ways to describe waves is for convenience—to
avoid handling large numbers. Since radio waves have photons with very low
energy, scientists and engineers use only frequency and wavelength to describe
them.
Electromagnetic Propagation
An electromagnetic wave moves or propagates in a direction that is at right an-
gles to the vibrations of both the electric and magnetic oscillating field vec-
tors, carrying energy from its radiation source to an undetermined final
18

destination. As shown in Figure 2-3, the electric and magnetic fields are mutu-
ally perpendicular.
All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in vacuum—that is, at the
speed of light, 299,792,458 meters per second (m/sec). The speed of light is des-
ignated by the lowercase letter c and is usually approximated to 300,000,000 m/
sec.For all our calculations,we will use the value of 300,000,000,or 3×10
8 m/sec.
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID

Using the speed of electromagnetic waves as c, we can rewrite the relation-
ship, described earlier, between frequency (ƒ) and wavelength (λ) as follows:
Exam Tip
Know that electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light, 3×10
8
m/sec, in a vacuum. The speed is almost the same in air.
As electromagnetic waves travel in space, they spread their power in a sphere
of increasing radius. This means the same amount of power is spread over the
surface of a larger sphere. This reduces the power density at any point as the
wave travels away from the source. This phenomenon is called path loss. Figure
2-4 shows a transmit antenna TX at the center of a sphere and a receive antenna

From this equation, you can conclude that the power density (PD) of a radio
wave at a distance (r) from its source is inversely proportional to the square of
the distance—PD á 1/r
2. In other words, power attenuates with the square of the
distance.

Radio Waves
RFID technology uses the radio wave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum;
therefore, our discussion of electromagnetic spectrum is limited to the radio
wave portion of the spectrum, specifically the radio waves in the range of 100
kHz to 5.8 GHz.
Radio signals are affected in many ways by objects in their path and by the me-
dia through which they travel.This means that radio signal propagation is of vital
importance to anyone designing or operating a radio system. The properties of
the path through which the radio signals propagate govern the level and quality of
the received signal.Reflection,refraction,and diffraction of the original signal can
occur and may add constructively or destructively to the original signal. The re-
sultant signal is a combination of several signals that have traveled by different
paths due to reflection, refraction, and diffraction. In addition, the signals travel-
ing via different paths can be delayed and can distort the resultant signal.
Radio signals propagate in many different ways, including free space propaga-
tion,ground wave propagation,ionospheric propagation,and tropospheric prop-
agation. These relate to the effects of the media through which the signals
propagate. RFID applications occur at very small distances; therefore, free space
propagation is the most important type.In free space propagation,the major fac-
tor affecting the signal strength is the distance between the transmitter and the re-
ceiver. RFID systems need to have their radio propagation models generated for
factory, warehouse, office, or urban situations. Under these circumstances, the
free space propagation is modified by multiple reflections, refractions, and dif-
fractions. Despite these complications, it is still possible to generate rough guide-
lines and models for these radio propagation scenarios.
Within the radio spectrum is an enormous range of frequencies. To catego-
rize and manage the different areas of the spectrum, the radio spectrum is split
into many different segments, but RFID technology uses only four of these seg-
ments,as shown in the following table.Figure 2-5 shows these frequencies in re-
lation to the entire radio spectrum.

The radio spectrum is an aspect of the physical world, like land, water, and
air. Use of radio frequency bands of the electromagnetic spectrum is regulated
by governments in most countries, in a process known as frequency and/or
spectrum allocation. Like weather and internationally traded goods, radio
propagation and RF technology do not stop at national boundaries. For eco-
nomic and technical reasons, governments all over the world have sought to
harmonize spectrum allocation standards by regulating various aspects of radio
spectrum use.
The following forums and standards bodies have worked and/or contributed
to standards for frequency allocation:
•
ITU
International Telecommunication Union
•
CEPT
European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications
Administrations
•
ETSI
European Telecommunications Standards Institute
•
CISPR
International Special Committee on Radio Interference
Interference and Multipath
Interference is the superposition of two or more waves resulting in a new wave
pattern. Multiple waves may be generated due to various effects of propagation
of the original wave and/or completely different waves from other processes.
When waves generated due to propagation effects take a different path than the
original wave, it is called multipath. The phenomenon of wave reflection, dif-
fraction, and scattering all give rise to additional radio propagation paths be-
yond the direct line-of-sight (LOS) path between the radio transmitter and
receiver. Due to multipath, caused by whatever phenomenon, the actual re-
ceived signal level is a vector sum of all signals incident from any direction or
angle of arrival. Some signals add to the direct path, while other signals subtract
from the direct signal path. This creates bright and dark spots within the an-
tenna radiation pattern.
Local Lingo
Hot spot
Hot spot or bright spot refers to spaces within the antenna beam
where power density is higher than normal.
Cold spot
Cold spot refers to spaces within the antenna beam where
power density is lower than normal. Hot and cold spots make the
antenna radiation pattern look like Swiss cheese.

As radio waves travel, they interact with objects and the media they encoun-
ter. This interaction causes reflection, refraction, diffraction, scattering, and ab-
sorption of the wave. This interaction also can change the waves’ direction of
travel or it can block the waves. The change in direction causes the waves to
reach areas that would not be possible if the radio signals traveled in a direct
line. This has advantages, because the signals can reach an area that is not in di-
rect LOS, and it also has disadvantages, because the reflections of the signal or
other signals in the vicinity can interfere with the original signal.
Exam Tip
Know that multipath causes variations in power density within an
antenna beam.
Reflection
Radio waves, like light waves, are reflected by many surfaces. Reflection occurs
when a propagating electromagnetic wave impinges upon an object that has
very large dimensions compared to the wavelength of the propagating wave.
Surfaces of conductive materials reflect signals more than nonconductive mate-
rials.Radio signal reflection follows the same law as light wave reflection: the an-
gle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. When a radio signal is
reflected, some loss of the signal is normally incurred, either through absorp-
tion or as a result of some of the signal passing into the medium. In a manufac-
turing facility or warehouse,metallic objects,such as heavy machinery,shelving,
rolling metallic shutters on dock doors, or metallic conveyors, reflect radio
waves.
When a radio wave hits a material, some of the power is reflected at the sur-
face and some of the power is transmitted into and possibly through the mate-
rial. If the material is a conductor such as metal, almost all of the radio power is
reflected within the first few atoms of the material. Buildings made of metal,
metal-coated glasses, or steel-reinforced concrete, reflect most of the radio en-
ergy. When radio waves impinge upon a material that is a dielectric (an insula-
tor), some of the power is reflected at the surface but most of the power travels
through the material. How much power travels through a dielectric depends on
both the thickness of the material and its attenuation coefficient. Examples of
dielectrics are paper,plastic,Teflon,glass,ceramic,and dry wood.Pure water is a
good dielectric substance.
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
25

Figure 2-6 shows radio wave reflection and multipath created due to re-
flection.
Exam Tip
Metals reflect radio waves while aqueous liquids absorb radio
waves.
Diffraction
Radio signals may also undergo diffraction, which occurs when signals encoun-
ter an obstacle and tend to travel around them. Diffraction occurs when the ra-
dio path between the transmitter and receiver is obstructed by a surface that has
sharp irregularities (edges). The secondary waves resulting from the obstruct-
ing surface are present throughout the space, even behind the obstacle, giving
rise to a bending of waves around the obstacle, even when a LOS path does not
exist between transmitter and receiver. At high frequencies, diffraction, like re-
flection, depends on the geometry of the object, as well as the amplitude, phase,
and polarization of the incident wave at the point of diffraction.
Scattering
Scattering occurs when the medium through which the wave travels consists of
objects with dimensions that are small compared to the wavelength, and where
the number of such objects per unit volume is large. Scattered waves are pro-
duced by rough surfaces, small objects, or by other irregularities in the channel.
When a radio wave impinges on a rough surface, the reflected energy is diffused

Radio wave reflection

in all directions due to scattering. Figure 2-7 shows radio wave diffraction and
scattering.
Refraction
Refraction is a change in direction and speed of travel when radio waves move
from a medium of one refractive index to another with a different refractive in-
dex. This is similar to the effect you see when you place a pencil at an angle in a
glass of water.The pencil seems to bend.This phenomenon does not have much
importance in RFID application.
Fading
Another term frequently used in the RF arena is fading.Fading is the variation of
signal strength with time. It happens due to time dependent random changes in
multipath. A fade is a constantly changing, three-dimensional phenomenon.
Fade zones tend to be small,multiple areas of space within an IZ that cause peri-
odic attenuation of a received signal.In other words,the received signal strength
will fluctuate downward,causing a momentary,but periodic,degradation in ra-
dio signal quality. One may visualize signal strength with the IZ as a Swiss
cheese, where holes in the cheese represent fade zones. The fading effect grows
worse at greater distances from the interrogator antenna.It is impossible to esti-
mate signal strength accurately at various points in an IZ due to the random na-
ture of fades.
dB and dBm
Signal levels in radio technology vary by a large magnitude,requiring use of very
large and very small numbers. To overcome the inconvenience of handling large
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
27

numbers, engineers use decibel (dB) to describe signal levels. A decibel is one
tenth of a Bel.A Bel is a ratio of two power levels and is named in honor of Alex-
ander Graham Bell; that’s why the B is capitalized. Bel and decibel are defined as
follows:
P1 and P2 are power levels with the same units.
dB is a logarithmic measure, and it produces easy to handle numbers for
large-scale variations in signals. It is useful because system gains and losses can
be calculated by adding and subtracting numbers. Remember high school alge-
bra: log (a × b) = log a + log b and log (a/b) = log a – log b. Like percentage, a ratio
of two quantities, dB has no units. Let’s consider antenna gain and cable losses,
both of which are defined later in this chapter. Gain, a ratio of output to input
where output is greater than input, is always greater than 1 and thus has a posi-
tive dB value. Loss, again a ratio of output to input but where output is less than
input, has a value less than 1 and thus has a negative dB value. The log of num-
bers greater than 1 is positive and for numbers less than 1 it is negative.
To make this concept clearer, here are some examples of dB usage:
•
Gain has positive value while loss has negative value.
•
Every time you double (or halve) the power level, you add (or subtract)
3 dB to (or from) the power level.
•
A 10 dB gain/loss corresponds to a ten-fold increase/decrease
in signal level.
•
A 20 dB gain/loss corresponds to a hundred-fold increase/decrease
in signal level.
•
If a cable has 2 dB loss (a typical value for the most antenna cables), it
will lose 37 percent of its signal by the time it gets to the other end.
•
If a cable has 20 dB loss, it will lose 99 percent of its signal by the time
it gets to the other end.
Exam Tip
Know that a gain of 3 dB is 2 times, 10 dB is 10 times, and 20 dB is
100 times. Gains have positive values while losses have negative
values.

The power of a radio signal is expressed in watts. Since the power levels vary
by a large amount, it is easier to express them in dBm, decibel relative to 1
milliwatt,rather than in watts.The relation between dBm and watts is defined as
follows:
The following table shows power values in watts and their equivalent values
in dBm.

3 dB halves the power.
Modulation and Encoding
The data, consisting of ones and zeroes, communicated between tags and read-
ers must be sent in a reliable manner.Two steps are critical to reliable communi-
cation: the encoding of the data and the transmission of the encoded data—that
is, the modulation of the communication signal. The combination of coding
and modulation schemes determines the bandwidth, integrity, and tag power
consumption.
The prime purpose of radio communication is to convey information from
one place to another through the intervening media without wires—for exam-
ple, an RFID interrogator sending or receiving data to or from an RFID tag. A
carrier wave, typically a sinusoidal wave, is used to transport the information.
The carrier wave is a radio wave of a specific frequency and amplitude broadcast
by the transmitter to carry information.Information is conveyed by modulating
the carrier wave. The three key parameters of a wave are its amplitude, its phase,
and its frequency, all of which can be modified in accordance with an informa-
tion signal to obtain the modulated signal. A device that performs modulation
is known as a modulator and a device that performs the inverse operation of de-
modulation, to extract information from the modulated wave, is known as a

demodulator. The actual information in a modulated signal is contained in its
sidebands, or frequencies added to the carrier wave, rather than in the carrier
wave itself. The most common types of modulation are amplitude modulation
(AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM).
AM varies the intensity,or amplitude,of the carrier wave.When the carrier is
thus modulated, a fraction of the power is converted to sidebands extending
above and below the carrier frequency by an amount equal to the highest modu-
lating frequency. The modulating signal is recovered by filtering out carrier fre-
quency. Since the carrier wave does not contain any information but is sent
along with information, the power used for carrier wave is wasted. There are
many variants of AM, such as single sideband modulation (SSB) to increase
transmission efficiency. FM varies the frequency of the carrier wave in such a
way that the change in frequency at any instant is proportional to the informa-
tion signal that varies with time. PM changes the phase of the carrier wave. The
two methods, FM and PM, are similar in the sense that any attempt to shift the
frequency or phase is accompanied by a change in the other.
The modulations AM, FM, and PM are sometimes known as continuous
wave modulation methods to distinguish them from pulse code modulation
(PCM),which is used to encode both digital and analog information in a binary
way. Other popular binary modulation schemes are amplitude shift keying
(ASK), frequency shift keying (FSK), phase shift keying (PSK), and quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM).
To transport digital bits of data across carrier waves,encoding techniques have
been developed,each with its own pros and cons.Modulation can be considered a
special case of encoding, though the terms tend to overlap in ordinary usage.
Technically speaking,modulation involves combining two signals,either of which
can be analog or digital,to produce a resultant signal,which can be analog or digi-
tal. Encoding, then, is the representation of data by a signal using any method.
Someof theencodingtechniquesarenon-return-to-zero(NRZ),return-to-zero
(RZ), Manchester Phase Encoding (MPE), pulse interval encoding (PIE), and
FM0. Some of these encoding schemes are discussed when RFID protocols that
use them are covered later in the book.Figure 2-8 shows an example of modula-
tion and encoding schemes.
Inductive and Backscatter Coupling
Passive tags do not have an active transmitter that communicates with the inter-
rogator. They typically couple the transmitter to the receiver with either load
modulation or backscatter, depending on whether the tags are operating in the

near-field or far-field of the interrogator. Coupling is the transfer of energy from
one medium to another medium, and passive tags use it to obtain power and
transfer data.The type of coupling used,inductive or backscatter (also known as
radiative), depends on the frequency and the distance between the tag and the
interrogator antenna. Inductive coupling uses near-field effects, while backscat-
ter coupling uses far-field effects.Near- and far-field effects are different mecha-
nisms for transfer of energy in free space.
The space surrounding any antenna can be divided into two parts, depend-
ing on the frequency and antenna size. The primary magnetic field begins at the
antenna and induces electric field lines in space. This area is termed the
near-field of an antenna. The zone where the electromagnetic field separates
from the antenna and propagates into free space as a plane wave is termed the
far-field. In far-field, the ratio of electric field (E) to magnetic field (H) has the
constant value of 120ð,or 377Ω.The boundary between near-field and far-field
depends on frequency of transmission and size of transmitting antenna. Be-
cause changes in electromagnetic fields occur gradually,this boundary is not ex-
actly defined. Several different formulas are used to estimate it. Since the
equations used to calculate this boundary are very complex, two simplified ap-
proximate formulas are generally used. For transmitting antennas that are elec-
trically small compared to a wavelength (ë) of transmission, the approximate
outer edge (r) of the near-field is given by
r = λ /2 π
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
31
FIGURE 2.8
Example of modulation and encoding

32
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
For transmitting antennas that are electrically large compared to a wavelength
(ë) of transmission,the approximate outer edge (r) of the near-field is given by
r = 2D
2 / λ (where D is the largest dimension of the antenna)
In the near-field, the 120π relationship between (E) and (H) is not necessary.
It is possible to have electric field with very little magnetic field, or vice versa.
The design of interrogator antennas dictates the choice between these two alter-
natives.RFID systems are generally designed to minimize any incidental electric
field generation. Within the near-field, the magnetic field strength attenuates
according to the relationship 1/d
3; the magnetic field intensity decays rapidly as
the inverse cube of the distance (d) between the interrogator antenna and the
tag. When the magnetic field strength is translated into power available to the
tag, the power attenuates according to 1/d
6. The magnetic field strength is thus
high in the immediate vicinity of the transmitting antenna, but its level is re-
duced to being negligible in the far-field. This helps create a spatially well-con-
fined IZ filled with magnetic field. In the near-field, the energy field fluctuates
outward from the radiating element and then back in to the radiating element in
a “push–pull” manner. Beyond the near-field, the electromagnetic energy sim-
ply radiates outward and the power drops off based on the inverse-square law.
Beyond the near-field boundary, the dominant fields are those associated with
energy propagation by electromagnetic waves away from the sources. This re-
gion is known as the far-field region. In the far-field region, the energy is contin-
uously transported away from the transmitting antenna.
RFID systems operating at 125–135 kHz and 13.56 MHz operate in the
near-field and use inductive coupling, while those operating beyond 100 MHz,
such as 860–960 MHz and 2400 and 5800 MHz, operate in the far-field and use
backscatter (radiative) coupling.
Near-field/Inductive Coupling
Inductive coupling refers to the transfer of energy from one circuit component to
another through a shared magnetic field. A change in current flow through one
device induces current flow in the other device. Coupling may be intentional or
unintentional. Unintentional coupling, called cross-talk, is a form of interfer-
ence. Inductive coupling favors low-frequency energy sources.
The wavelength of the frequency ranges used in inductively coupled RFID
systems (135 kHz: 2400 m; 13.56 MHz: 22.1 m) is much more than the conductor
length in any standard interrogator antenna. It is also several times greater than
the distance between the interrogator antenna and the tag antenna. Because of

this, the electromagnetic field may be treated as a simple magnetic alternating
field with regard to the distance between tag and antenna. Since the operating
wavelength is very much greater than the distance between the tag and interro-
gator,the coupling elements are not really antennas in the true sense,because no
real power is being radiated.Power transfer to and from the tag is by coupling of
reactive near-field energy in the immediate vicinity of the antenna structure.
The interrogator antenna, typically a coil, generates a strong, high-frequency
electromagnetic field. A small part of this field penetrates the tag antenna, also
typically a coil that is a small distance away from the interrogator antenna. By
induction, a voltage is generated in the tag antenna, just as in ordinary trans-
formers. This voltage is rectified and provides power supply for the integrated
circuit (IC) on the tag. A capacitor is connected in parallel with the interrogator
antenna. Its capacitance is selected such that it combines with the inductance of
the antenna to form a parallel resonant circuit with a resonant frequency that
corresponds to the transmission frequency of the interrogator. Very high cur-
rents are generated in the interrogator antenna by resonance step-up in the par-
allel resonant circuit, which can be used to generate the required field strengths
for the operation of the remote tag. This shows that the inductively coupled sys-
tems are based upon a transformer-type coupling between the primary coil in
the interrogator and the secondary coil in the tag. The optimum number of
turns needed in an antenna coil is inversely proportional to operating frequency.
As the frequency of operation increases,the number of turns required reduces.
The interrogator communicates with the tag by modulating a carrier wave by
varying the amplitude, phase, or frequency of the carrier. This modulation can
be directly detected as current changes in the coil of the tag. The tag communi-
cates with the interrogator by varying how much it loads its antenna. This in
turn affects the voltage across the interrogator’s antenna. By switching the load
on and off rapidly, the tag can create sideband frequencies, which are then cou-
pled into the interrogator antenna.
For an RFID system operating at 13.56 MHz, the approximate distance at
which the near-field zone ends is λ/2π, or 3.5 meters. Beyond this distance, the
magnetic field is reduced so low that tags cannot be powered. Due to this, the
typical read range for 13.56 MHz tags is less than 1 meter. The read distance de-
pends on the size of the interrogator antenna. Typical handheld interrogators
can read an electronic identity from about 2 inches.An interrogator with a large
antenna can read a tag up to 2 feet away. Inductively coupled systems are not af-
fected by water or human tissue but are sensitive to metal (conducting material)
in the operating zone. Also, as the magnetic field has vector characteristics, the
tag orientation influences performance of the system. Since inductive RFID
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
33

systems are operated in the near-field, interference from adjacent systems is
lower compared to radiatively coupled systems.
Any change in the magnetic environment of a coil of wire will cause a voltage
to be “induced” in the coil. No matter how the change is produced, the voltage
will be generated.The change could be produced by changing the magnetic field
strength,moving a magnet toward or away from the coil,moving the coil into or
out of the magnetic field, or rotating the coil relative to the magnet. This means
that this type of RFID system gets interference from magnets in the IZ. Figure
2-9 shows near-field coupling phenomenon.
Exam Tip
Know that inductive or near-field coupling is used by RFID systems
operating at the LF and HF frequency ranges.
Far-field/Backscatter Coupling
As the electromagnetic wave travels away from the antenna, the magnetic field
strength rapidly decays and its effect is negligible in far-field regions. Outside
the radius of the near-field, the wave from the interrogator propagates outward,
never giving energy back to the radiating element. This electromagnetic wave
travels outward and encounters the antenna element in the tag. When electro-
magnetic waves encounter an object that has a dimension of half the wavelength
or more, it gets reflected. The efficiency with which an object reflects electro-

magnetic waves is described by its reflection cross-section. Objects that are in res-
onance with the wave front that hits them, as is the case for an antenna at the
appropriate frequency, for example, have a particularly large reflection
cross-section.
An electromagnetic field propagates outward from the interrogator’s an-
tenna, and a small proportion of that field (reduced by free-space attenuation)
reaches the tag’s antenna. The power is supplied to the antenna connections as
high-frequency voltage, and after rectification by diodes it can be used to power
the tag or activate or deactivate the tag. Some proportion of the incoming RF
energy is reflected by the antenna and reradiated outward into free space. The
amount of energy reflected depends on how well the antenna couples to the
electromagnetic wave.RFID tags that use backscatter to reply to their interroga-
tors have antennas that are designed to resonate well with the carrier signal
emitted by the interrogator. The reflection characteristics of the antenna, its ef-
fective cross-section, can be influenced by altering the load connected to the an-
tenna. To transmit data from the tag to the interrogator, a load resistor
connected in parallel with the antenna is switched on and off in time with the
data stream to be transmitted. By changing resonant properties of its antenna,
the tag makes itself a good or poor reflector.This varies the strength of the signal
reflected from the tag, creating a pattern that is detected at the interrogator as
data. This technique is referred to as modulated backscatter.
Before the backscattered signal arrives at the interrogator antenna, it goes
through forward and backward path loss, many types of interferences in both
the directions, and absorption by the tag to power it. The reflected signal also
travels into the antenna connection of the interrogator in the reverse direction
from the original signal. It is decoupled using a directional coupler and trans-
ferred to the receiver input of the interrogator. The forward signal of the trans-
mitter is to a large degree suppressed by the directional coupler.
Tags operating at UHF and microwave frequencies use far-field and couple
with the interrogator using backscatter. The amount of energy received at the
receiver decreases as an inverse of the square of the distance (r) between the in-
terrogator antenna and tag (1/r
2).Figure 2-10 shows far-field coupling phenom-
enon.
Exam Tip
Remember that radiative, backscatter, or far-field coupling is used by
RFID systems operating at UHF and microwave frequency ranges.

Link Budgets and Read Range
The term link budget is used to specify how much loss (attenuation) in signal
strength can be tolerated and still allow the receiver to interpret an accurate sig-
nal. It is the accounting of all of the gains and losses from the transmitter,
through the medium, to the receiver in a radio signal system. It takes into ac-
count the attenuation of the transmitted signal due to propagation, as well as
the loss, or gain, due to the antenna and cable. Random attenuations such as
fading are not taken into account in link budget calculations. Link budget de-
fines the amount of power available in a radio link for transmission loss through
the path. With a known link budget, the range of a radio link can be determined
given a fixed path loss.
The first step in performing the link budget is determining the required sig-
nal strength at the receiver input.This is referred to as receiver sensitivity (PRX).A
simple link budget equation looks like this:
Link Budget = Transmit Power (PTX) + Transmit Antenna Gain (GTX) –
Cable Loss (LC) + Receive Antenna Gain (GRX) – Receiver Sensitivity (PRX)
Because of the large variation in path loss models for propagation in
real-world environments, the link budget becomes a more easily comparable
specification for evaluation of communication systems.It is generally true that a
higher link budget will provide longer range. For this reason, link budget is an
important specification for all RF systems.
36
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
FIGURE 2.10
Far-field coupling

We will discuss two different link budgets—the forward link and the com-
bined forward and return link budgets—because the requirements for forward
link are different from those of return link. The forward link, from interrogator
to tag, needs to power the passive tag and also transmit data, while the return
link, from tag to interrogator, needs only to transmit data. So we will calculate
the forward link budget and compute the maximum range at which a passive tag
can be powered. The passive tags do not have their own power source and de-
pend on the power received from the radio waves from the interrogator.
Travel Assistance
For more about passive tags, see Chapter 3.
The combined forward and return link budget will help calculate the maxi-
mum distance between the interrogator antenna and the tag at which the inter-
rogator can decode the signals reflected from the tag, also called the read range.
By comparing these two distances,you can determine the limiting factor for ob-
taining the maximum read range.
You can calculate the maximum distance at which a passive tag can be pow-
ered.A passive tag must receive a certain minimum amount of power to operate.
The amount depends on the type of processes used in manufacturing the inte-
grated circuit on the tag. A typical power requirement for a commonly available
tag is 100 µW (–10 dBm). Typical power from an interrogator, without consid-
ering antenna gain, is 1 W (30 dBm). This means you can sustain a 40 dB free
path loss from interrogator to tag, ignoring any interference. A typical passive
tag operating in the UHF frequency range has an antenna with an effective col-
lection area of approximately λ/3.5 per side. For simplicity, we use the 900 MHz
frequency in this example.You now have all the parameters,so you can calculate
the distance at which the tag can be powered:

According to the assumptions used for the calculations, 9 feet is the maxi-
mum distance at which a tag can be powered. Beyond this distance, the tag will
not collect enough power to run its IC and thus it cannot be detected by the in-
terrogator. You can increase this distance by employing a higher gain interroga-
tor antenna, increasing the tag antenna effective area, reducing the power
requirements of the tag IC, or some combination of these solutions. Typical
range for this type of tag is about 15 to 16 feet (4 to 5 meters) when used with a 6
dB gain interrogator antenna.
You can now calculate the maximum range at which a reader can detect the
tag if it is not restricted by the requirements of the power. You again start with 1
W power (PTX) from the interrogator and a tag antenna collection area (ARX) of
0.009 square meter. Assume that the interrogator antenna’s effective collection
area (ASC) is 0.009 square meter. The typical interrogator in UHF frequency us-
ing On-Off Keying (OOK) encoding requires a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB to
detect data (interrogator sensitivity). The typical data rate for this system is ap-
proximately 100 Kbps, giving the bandwidth of the signal at around 300 kHz.
Now you calculate the noise floor, power of noise, at 300 kHz. The noise power
into a 50 ohm resistor at room temperature is –174 dBm/Hz. For 300 kHz, it is
–174 dBm × 300,000 (approximately 55 dB).
Noiseflooratthesignalfrequencyof 300kHz=–174dBm+55dB=–119dBm.
The signal power required = Noise floor + Interrogator sensitivity =
–119 dBm + 12 dB = –107 dBm (2×10
–14W). This is the minimum power (PRX)
that must be received by the interrogator from the tag. You now have all the
values you need to calculate the maximum read range. You will use free
space path loss from the interrogator to the tag and then back from the tag
to the interrogator.

These two calculations show that the link budget from the interrogator to the
tag to power the tag is the limiting factor for the UHF tags. If tags can be pow-
ered at a greater distance, they can be read further than 16 feet (5 meters).
Exam Tip
For passive RFID tags at UHF and microwave frequencies, know that
the read range is limited by the distance at which the tag can be
powered, not from how far the tag may be interrogated.
Unlicensed Operation
and Frequency Hopping
Unlicensed operation means you are not required to get a permit from a regulatory
agency, such as the FCC in the United States, to operate a radio frequency device.
Ranges of frequencies have been set aside by regulatory agencies all over the
world,and these fall into an unlicensed category collectively called Industrial,Sci-
entific, and Medical (ISM) bands. Unlicensed does not mean unregulated, how-
ever. Many aspects of this band are regulated, including which frequencies can be
used for what purposes, maximum amount power that can be radiated, and the
duty cycle of the device operation. These regulations are published by the regula-
tory authority in each country and vary from country to country.All device man-
ufacturers using ISM bands must have regulatory agency certification that their
devices operate according to the regulations and must prominently display this
certification logo. Unlicensed devices must not cause harmful interference to
other radio services. The operator of the device is responsible for correcting any
harmful interference that results from the use of the device.
Travel Assistance
Unlicensed operation is covered in more detail in Chapter 10.
Because of their unlicensed nature, ISM bands are popular for establishing
wireless data links with short-range wireless devices. With the increase in popu-
larity there is an increase in the number of devices operating in ISM. This has
created a congested frequency spectrum, resulting in more interference that can
degrade performance of wireless devices.

40
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
To reduce the probability of interference, systems are often designed to use
spread-spectrum.In spread-spectrum,the device uses a narrow band carrier and
changes frequency in a given pattern. It transmits at one frequency for a short
period of time and then switches to another.Only a fixed number of frequencies
are available for a particular group of applications, and they are called channels.
The switch from one channel to another is called a frequency hop.
In a frequency hopping system, the available channel bandwidth is subdivided
into a large number of contiguous frequency slots. In any signaling interval, the
transmitted signal occupies one of the available frequency slots. Selecting the fre-
quency slots during each signaling interval is made pseudorandomly. Due to the
random nature of frequency slot selection, the chances of two similar devices op-
erating at the same slot are reduced. Another advantage of this system is that they
are often more immune to interference from other types of systems operating in
the same frequency range.
The probability of interception is reduced, because frequency hopping sig-
nals have a low average power density at any given slot, which can make these
signals difficult to intercept. Also pseudorandom frequency hopping makes
these signals difficult to demodulate, if intercepted, by unintended receivers.
Signal Interception and Security
RFID communication occurs in an open environment without any solid en-
cryption. Therefore, the signals, if received by an unintended receiver, can be
easily interpreted. The response from tags operating at around 900 MHz can be
decoded at up to 71 meters in open air,as was calculated earlier in the discussion
of link budget. If this signal passes through a wall, it loses some strength, de-
pending on the type of wall,but it may still be intercepted and demodulated by a
good receiver at 20 to 30 meters. The unintended receiver will not be able to
power the tag at that distance, but once powered by the authorized interrogator,
the signals could be intercepted at a longer distance. In addition to the security
issues, problems of reading out-of-process tags, the tags that are not inside the
intended read zone, could result. This should be considered when you are de-
signing an RFID system.
Exam Tip
Remember that once powered, passive UHF tags can be interrogated
from a distance farther than the normally quoted read range of up to
16 feet.

Objective 2.2
Antenna Performance
and Characteristics
An antenna is a conductive structure that radiates an electromagnetic wave when
a time-varying (alternating) electrical current is applied to it. Any similar struc-
ture can radiate an electromagnetic wave, but it will not do so efficiently. To radi-
ate efficiently and in a desired manner,the structure must be designed properly as
an antenna.In other words,an antenna is a particular arrangement of conductors
designed to radiate (transmit) an electromagnetic field in response to an applied
alternating electric current. It also generates voltage between its terminals when
placed into a time-varying electromagnetic field. An antenna is an electronic
component designed to transmit or receive radio waves. It converts electrical en-
ergy into a radiating field that extends infinitely outward. All RFID systems in-
clude two different types of antennas: the interrogator antenna and the tag
antenna. The antenna performance characteristic is one of the most critical ele-
ments of any RFID installation, because the antenna transfers power and data
from the interrogator to the passive RFID tags and receives the tag’s reply.
Design Characteristics
An antenna’s performance is affected by several parameters that can be manip-
ulated during antenna design to achieve certain performance characteristics:
resonant frequency, impedance, gain, radiation pattern, polarization, effi-
ciency, and bandwidth. Transmit antennas may also have a maximum power
rating, and receive antennas differ in their noise rejection properties. An an-
tenna without an amplifier is called a passive antenna. Such antennas have the
same characteristics whether they are transmitting or receiving. This property
is called reciprocity. Therefore, any antenna can be used for transmitting or re-
ceiving signals or for both purposes. All antennas used in RFID systems are of
the passive type.
When the circuit is much shorter than the wavelength of the signal,the rate at
which it radiates energy is proportional to the size of the current, the length of
the circuit, and the frequency of the alternations. In most circuits, the product
of these three quantities is small enough that not much energy is radiated, and
the result is that the reactive field dominates the radiating field.When the length
of the antenna approaches the wavelength of the signal, the current along the
antenna is no longer uniform and the calculation of power output becomes
more complex.

42
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Resonant Frequency and Bandwidth
As mentioned,any circuit driven with a signal of high enough frequency will ra-
diate but may not be efficient. Antennas are designed to radiate efficiently at a
particular frequency. For example, a dipole antenna (an antenna with two wires
connected to a transmission line) that is much smaller than the wavelength of
the signal is an inefficient antenna but radiates over a wide range of frequencies.
Compare this with a half-wave dipole antenna; it radiates with high efficiency
when fed with the signal whose wavelength is twice the electrical length of the
antenna.This frequency is called the resonant frequency of the antenna.At reso-
nant frequency, as shown in Figure 2-11, the capacitive and inductive compo-
nents of the antenna impedance become zero.
Most antennas are resonant devices that operate efficiently over a relatively
narrow frequency band. Typically an antenna is tuned for a specific resonant
frequency and is effective for a range of frequencies usually centered on that res-
onant frequency. As a tag moves away from this frequency in either direction,
the efficiency of the antenna decreases. The resonant frequency is related to the
electrical length of the antenna. The physical length of a simple antenna is usu-
ally 95 percent of the electrical length. In a complex antenna, the electrical
length can be made significantly shorter or longer than the physical length by
the addition of an appropriate reactive element. In RFID systems, antennas are
FIGURE 2.11
Resonant frequency

designed for a particular frequency—for example, HF, UHF, or microwave. No
antenna tuning is required during installation of the antenna.
The bandwidth of an antenna is the range of frequencies over which the an-
tenna is effective.The bandwidth is typically centered on the resonant frequency
of the antenna. The UHF RFID systems work at 902 to 928 MHz in the United
States. The central frequency of this range is 915 MHz. All the antennas for this
system are designed for 915 MHz resonant frequency and they must work well
over a band of ± 13 MHz from 915 MHz.Typically,usable bandwidth is between
the frequencies at which the voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), a term to be
defined in the next section, is less than 2.0. This is shown in Figure 2-12.
Exam Tip
Know that an antenna transmits a radio signal most efficiently when
the antenna resonant frequency matches the signal carrier frequency.

Impedance and VSWR
The impedance of an antenna is the sum of its radiation resistance and its ohmic
resistance and any reactive components. Power absorbed by the radiation resis-
tance results in power radiated into space, and power absorbed by the ohmic re-
sistance is converted to heat and wasted. Radiation resistance varies with
antenna length. Resistance increases as the electrical length of the antenna in-
creases. An antenna circuit can be analyzed as a simple series circuit with resis-
tive, inductive, and capacitive (RLC) reactance. All of these quantities vary with
the length of the antenna. For an antenna much smaller than half the wave-
length of the signal, resistance and inductance are very small and capacitance is
quite large. As the antenna length increases, resistance and inductance increase
while the capacitance decreases. An antenna size equal to approximately a half
wavelength, capacitance and inductance are equal and cancel each other out,
and the resistance is called antenna impedance.
One of the goals of antenna design is to minimize the reactance of the device
so that it appears as a pure resistive load.Reactance causes energy to be wasted as
heat. Reactance can be eliminated by operating the antenna at its resonant fre-
quency,where its capacitive and inductive reactances are equal and opposite,re-
sulting in a net zero reactive current. Once the reactance has been eliminated,
what remains is a pure resistance,which is the sum of two parts: the ohmic resis-
tance of the conductors and the radiation resistance. The greater the ratio of ra-
diation resistance to ohmic resistance,the more efficient the antenna becomes.
Different parts of the antenna systems, such as interrogator, feed line, an-
tenna, and free space, may have different impedance. At each interface between
differing impedance, some fraction of the wave’s energy reflects back to the
source. This reflection back to the source and the original wave traveling for-
ward form a standing wave. The ratio of maximum power to minimum power
in the wave can be measured and is called the voltage standing wave ratio
(VSWR). The ideal value for VSWR is 1:1, which corresponds to a perfect im-
pedance match. Minimizing impedance differences at each interface (imped-
ance matching) will reduce VSWR and maximize power transfer through each
part of the antenna system. Therefore, VSWR is a measure of impedance mis-
match between the two interfaces in the antenna system.Almost all radio equip-
ment is built for an impedance of 50 ohm.The higher the VSWR,the greater the
mismatch and lesser the power radiated. A value of 2:1 VSWR, which is equal to
90 percent power absorption, is considered very good for a small antenna; 3:1 is

considered acceptable, and is equal to 75 percent power absorption. Impedance
mismatch can occur due to bad connections,incorrect antenna length,or wrong
feed line cable.
Exam Tip
Remember that RFID systems use antenna and cable with 50 ohm
impedance. The ideal value for VSWR is 1:1 and as this value
increases, the efficiency decreases.
Gain, Directivity, and Radiation Patterns
Before getting into antenna gain, you need to understand a few terms used in
describing it. A dipole antenna is an antenna with a feeder connected at the cen-
ter and two wires spreading away from the feeder.An isotropic antenna is a theo-
retical antenna that radiates equally well in all directions. This is a conceptual
antenna used for comparison purpose only. An omnidirectional antenna radi-
ates equally in all directions in one plane. You will learn more about these in the
section “Types of Antennas” later in this chapter.
Gain is the ratio of the signals, usually expressed in dB, received or transmit-
ted by a given antenna as compared to an isotropic or dipole antenna. Antenna
gain can be achieved only by making an antenna directional—that is, by having
better performance in one direction at the expense of the other directions. The
left side of Figure 2-13 shows the antenna gain and its radiation pattern. The
middle portion shows the equivalent isotropic antenna. The gain of an antenna
is a passive phenomenon.Power is not added by the antenna but is simply redis-
tributed to provide more radiated power in a certain direction than would be
transmitted by a reference antenna. If an antenna has a positive gain in some di-
rections, it must have a negative gain in other directions (conservation of en-
ergy). The gain of an antenna is therefore a tradeoff between the angle of
coverage and power in a covered space. The reason gain is necessary is because
we may want to radiate only in a specific direction at a longer distance. For ex-
ample, an antenna communicating with a satellite needs a very narrow beam
and a very high gain.
An antenna aperture is the diameter of the cross-section of an antenna’s radi-
ation pattern in the direction of highest gain. This frequently is assumed to be
circular and is provided as a radius or the angle of the radiation cone.The beam-
width of an antenna is a measure of the directivity of an antenna and is usually
CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
45

defined by the angle at which the pattern drops to one half of its peak value.This
is also referenced as 3 dB beamwidth.
The radiation pattern is the three-dimensional plot of the gain in all direc-
tions. Usually only the two-dimensional horizontal and vertical cross-sections
of the radiation pattern are considered. Antennas with high gain typically show
side lobes in the radiation pattern. Side lobes, shown in the upper-right of Fig-
ure 2-13,are peaks in gain other than the main lobe (the “beam”).Side lobes de-
tract from the antenna quality and reduce gain in the main lobe by distributing
power in the side lobes that is not useful.
The gain of an antenna is a ratio of two quantities, and thus the reference
point of the ratio must be specified. It is expressed in either dBi (decibels over
isotropic) or dBd (decibels over dipole) units. If the reference antenna is an iso-
tropic antenna,the gain is expressed in dBi.When a dipole antenna is used as the
reference,the gain of the antenna is expressed in dBd.Many times antenna spec-

Antenna gain and radiation pattern

CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID

ifications mention only dB rather than dBi or dBd; in this situation, it is usually
understood to be dBd,but using an antenna in which the gain is explicitly speci-
fied as dBi or dBd can help you avoid surprises later. Gain specified in dBi is al-
ways a higher number than gain specified in dBd.
An isotropic antenna cannot be created in the real world, but it is useful for
calculating theoretical fade and system operating margins.A dipole antenna has
2.15 dB gain over a 0 dBi isotropic antenna; therefore 0 dBd is equal to 2.15 dBi.
So if an antenna gain is provided in dBd, not in dBi, you can add 2.15 to it to get
the dBi rating. For example, if an antenna has 6 dBd gain, it would have 6 + 2.15
= 8.15 dBi gain. Antenna manufacturers specify gain in dBd because they cali-
brate their equipment using a simple dipole antenna as the standard. Then they
replace it with the antenna they are testing. The difference in gain (in dB) is in
reference to the signal from the dipole antenna, providing gain in dBd.
Two other terms used in radiocommunications are effective radiated power
(ERP) and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). These terms are used to de-
scribe power output from an antenna. ERP is the product of the power supplied
to the antenna and its gain relative to a half-wave dipole antenna in a given di-
rection, usually in the direction of maximum gain (main lobe). EIRP is the
product of the power supplied to the antenna and its gain relative to an isotropic
antenna in a given direction, usually in the direction of maximum gain (main
lobe). The ERP and EIRP are simply the transmitter power times the antenna
gain and can be expressed in units of watts,milliwatts,dBw,or dBm.Remember
that in dB units, multiplication becomes addition due to the logarithmic nature
of dB.
Let’s consider two examples of EIRP calculation,one using watts and another
using dB. An interrogator connected to an antenna with 6 dBi gain is emitting
1 W of power at the antenna terminal (we will ignore cable losses). What is the
EIRP from the antenna?
•
Using Watts
6 dBi antenna gain means the antenna amplifies the
signal by a factor of 4. So EIRP = interrogator power output × antenna
gain = 1 × 4 = 4 watts.
•
Using dB
Converting 1 W from interrogator into dB units gives 30
dBm. Now calculate EIRP = interrogator power output + antenna gain
= 30 dBm + 6 dBi = 36 dBm.
Using either method, we get the same answer, because 4 watts = 36 dBm.

In this example we could have used 9 dBi antenna and 0.5 W power from the
interrogator and would have reached the same power radiating from the an-
tenna,36 dBm.But this setup has an advantage over the previous one,because if
the same antenna is used to transmit as well as receive, the higher antenna gain
will apply to the received signal also. Since the tags receive and backscatter the
same power in both the cases,the higher gain would provide higher powered re-
ceive signals to the interrogator.
Exam Tip
Remember that the typical value for maximum interrogator power is
30 dBm or 1 watt, for antenna cable loss is 2 dB, and for antenna
gain is 8 dBi.
Polarization
Electromagnetic waves, traveling in free space, have an electric field component
(E) and a magnetic field component (H).These two components are perpendicu-
lar to each other, and both are also perpendicular to the direction of propagation
of the wave. The orientation of the (E) vector is used to define the polarization of
the wave.If the (E) field is orientated vertically,the wave is said to be vertically po-
larized.If it is orientated horizontally,the wave is said to be horizontally polarized.
When the (E) field rotates with time, the wave is said to be circularly polarized.
Polarization of the radiated wave plays an important role when you are concerned
with the coupling between two antennas. Figure 2-14 shows polarization of a ra-
dio wave.
When electromagnetic waves propagate from an antenna, the position and
direction of the (E) field of the wave with reference to the Earth’s surface, the
ground, determines the polarization of the antenna. The antenna is said to be
horizontally polarized if the (E) field is parallel to the ground and vertically po-
larized if (E) field is perpendicular to the ground.Both of these polarizations are
called linear polarization,where (E) field always remains in one plane.When (E)
field rotates over time, the antenna is said to be circularly polarized. If the (E)
field rotates in right-hand/left-hand manner, the antenna is considered to be
right-hand/left-hand circularly polarized. The circularly polarized antenna
transfers only half of its total power in any one polarization.
For a receiving antenna to be able to receive radio signals, its polarization
must match that of the transmitting antenna. If the polarization of two anten-
nas does not match, lower radiative coupling can take place between them and
48
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
49
less information can be transferred between them. A right-hand circularly po-
larized antenna cannot couple with left-hand circularly polarized or linearly
polarized antenna; they must be matched.
Travel Advisory
If a vendor specifies antenna gain only in dB, be sure to find out
whether it is dBi or dBd. If the vendor cannot tell you or does not
know the difference, you should consider buying an antenna from
another vendor.
Antenna polarization has many implications for RFID systems. A horizon-
tally/vertically polarized antenna will optimally read tags that are oriented hori-
zontally/vertically and will not read as well the tags that are oriented vertically/
horizontally. A circularly polarized, right-hand, or left-hand antenna will read
tags in any orientation but will provide only half the power of an identical but
linearly polarized antenna. Two antennas of different polarization operating in
close vicinity will not interfere with each other. Even a right-hand circularly po-
larized antenna will not interfere with a left-hand circularly polarized antenna.
An antenna’s polarization is given in its specification,usually along with its gain.
For example, an antenna with an 8 dBi gain and linear polarization would be
specified as 8 dBil, where l in the specification stands for linear polarization.
FIGURE 2.14
Polarization of radio wave

50
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
This brings us to the four different ways of specifying antenna gain, shown
with their meaning here:
•
dBil
Relative to isotropic antenna with linear polarization
•
dBic
Relative to isotropic antenna with circular polarization
•
dBdl
Relative to dipole antenna with linear polarization
•
dBdc
Relative to dipole antenna with circular polarization
Exam Tip
Remember that antennas with different polarization do not
communicate and also do not interfere with each other.
Antenna Performance
Antenna efficiency is the ratio of power actually radiated from the antenna to
the power provided to the antenna terminals. Radiation in an antenna is caused
by radiation resistance, which can be measured only as a part of the total resis-
tance, including the loss resistance. The loss resistance usually results in heat
generation rather than radiation, and therefore reduces efficiency. Impedance
of an antenna can be easily measured with specialized equipment. Measuring
the radiation pattern requires a sophisticated setup, including an anechoic
chamber (to exclude radiation noise) designed for antenna measurements, pre-
cise placement of measuring equipment,and specialized equipment that rotates
the antenna during the measurements. All of the antenna parameters are ex-
pressed in terms of a transmission antenna but are identically applicable to a re-
ceiving antenna due to reciprocity. The measurement of impedance at the load,
where the power is consumed, is most critical. For a transmitting antenna, the
load is the antenna itself, while for a receiving antenna, the load is the receiver
rather than the antenna.
The reading range of an RFID antenna depends on many variables: the an-
tenna size, the tag size, the tag’s orientation with respect to the transmitting an-
tenna, the antenna location with respect to other materials, and the ambient
electrical and magnetic noise within the band of interest. The impedance of an
antenna should match that of its connecting transmission line.The polarization
of an antenna should match with the tag orientation.
Antennas used for transmission have a maximum specified power rating,be-
yond which heating, arcing, or sparking may occur in the components, which

CHAPTER 2 The RF in RFID
51
may cause them to be damaged or destroyed. This, of course, is a concern only
for transmitting antennas; the power received by an antenna rarely exceeds the
microwatt range.
Types of Antennas
Following are brief descriptions of a few common antenna types found in many
RFID systems.
Isotropic Antenna
The isotropic radiator is a purely theoretical antenna that radiates equally in all
directions. It is considered to be a point in space with no dimensions and no
mass.This antenna cannot physically exist,but is useful as a theoretical model for
comparison with all other antennas. Most antennas’ gains are measured with
reference to an isotropic radiator and are rated in dBi (decibels with respect to
an isotropic radiator). An isotropic antenna’s radiation pattern is spherical.
Dipole and Monopole Antennas
The dipole antenna is simply two thin conductors (wires) pointed in opposite
directions, arranged either horizontally or vertically, with one end of each con-
ductor connected to the feed line and the other end hanging free in space. Both
the conductors usually have the same lengths, and their combined length deter-
mine the antenna’s wavelength. The two conductors are driven by a voltage ap-
plied to the feed line in the middle. The ideal length for a dipole antenna tuned
to 915 MHz is about 16 cm (6.5 inches).It is has a modest gain of 2.15 dBi.Since
this is the simplest practical antenna, it is also used as a reference model for
other antennas. When a dipole is used as a reference to calculate gain of an an-
tenna, the gain of that antenna is expressed as dBd. Variations of the dipole in-
clude folded dipole, half-wave antenna, and monopole. Monopole is half the
dipole. Monopole antennas are vertical antennas erected on the ground, where
the ground, being a conductive material, acts as a reflector, providing an image
of the monopole and effectively creating the dipole. Monopole antennas are
used for radio transmission, but they are generally less efficient than equivalent
dipole antennas. Figure 2-15 shows dipole and monopole antennas.
Generally, the dipole has a toroidal (donut-shaped) radiation pattern, where
the axis of the toroid is aligned with the axis of the dipole. This pattern is shown
on the left side of Figure 2-16. Most of the power transmitted by a dipole is in
horizontal (H) plane with an omnidirectional pattern. In the other two planes,

perpendicular to the H plane, it has a transmission pattern like a figure 8. These
planes are shown on the right side of Figure 2-16.It has nulls,no power radiated,
along the north and the south poles.
Exam Tip
Remember that a dipole antenna has nulls at its north and south poles.
Therefore, when a tag antenna pole is pointing in the direction
perpendicular to interrogator antenna plane, the tag cannot be
interrogated.
Antenna Arrays
When several antenna elements—usually single wire dipoles and reflec-
tors—are combined, they form an antenna array. This provides a particular
52

FIGURE 2.16
Simple dipole antenna radiation pattern

radiation pattern and gain in a desired direction or is useful when it is difficult
to achieve desired electrical properties with a single antenna. Two common an-
tenna arrays are the Yagi-Uda antenna, usually called Yagi, and the patch an-
tenna. The Yagi antenna is sometimes called a beam antenna. This antenna was
common before cable and satellite for television and was mounted on roofs for
receiving television transmission.
Patch antenna consists of a thin square of conducting material, approxi-
mately half wavelength on a side that is closely spaced above a larger reflector
plane. The center point of this active element may be grounded using a vertical
conductor. A patch antenna can be thought of as a pair of half wavelength slot
antennas, spaced by half a wavelength. The antenna impedance varies with the
location of the feed point for the active element. The active elements may be of
almost any shape, including round and square. A square active element has ap-
proximately 0.47 wavelengths on each side, while a round one is 0.54 wave-
lengths in diameter. The spacing between the active element and the reflector is
> 0.01 wavelength, and spacing less than this results in reduced efficiency. For
RFID systems, patch antennas are usually designed to have circular polarization
and about 6 dBi to 8 dBi gain. Figure 2-17 shows a patch antenna and Figure
2-18 shows a patch antenna array.
Other Antenna Types
Tunnel antennas are used at many conveyor systems. The antenna wraps around
the conveyor and allows the reader’s energy field to be uniformly radiated inside the
tunnel.This allows tags to be read regardless of their orientation or position.A tun-

Loop antenna consists of a conducting coil leading from one conductor of a
two-wire transmission line to the other conductor. The principal lobe of the ra-
diation pattern is wide and is in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the
loop. A loop antenna is very directional and its gain is proportional to the loop
diameter: the larger the diameter, the higher the gain.
Cables and Connectors
Cables connecting the interrogator with antennas are many times called trans-
mission lines.Some cables are permanently connected to the antenna at one end,
while others have different types of connectors at both the ends.
Cables come in two different varieties. One type of cable is a balanced twin
conductor made up of two parallel conductors. A second type of cable is a coax-
ial unbalanced line made of two coaxial conductors. In RFID systems, all the ca-
bles used to connect antennas with the interrogator are coaxial type.The coaxial
cable,shown in Figure 2-20,consists of four parts: the inner conductor,which is
either a solid or stranded wire; a surrounding dielectric material; the outer con-
ductor made of braided strands or foil; and the outermost insulator jacket. The
outer conductor provides a shield against RF leakage from and to the cable. The
effectiveness of the shield depends on the quality and density of the braid. At
high frequencies, the braid must be tighter. Coaxial cables come in various di-
ameters, the higher the diameter, the lower the loss but the higher the cost.
Thicker cables are difficult to install and have a higher minimum bending ra-
dius. The following table shows a few cable types and their attenuation per 100
feet cable length.

Cables used in RF systems must have impedance that matches the compo-
nents to which they are connected. Mismatched impedance will reduce effi-
ciency of the system and may create a problem of radiation leakage. All RF
devices used in RFID systems, interrogators, and antennas have an impedance
of 50 ohms. Therefore, the cables should also have the impedance of 50 ohms.

RF connectors are attached to ends of coaxial cables used to interconnect
various RF devices.The connectors include threaded or bayonet-style couplings
that snap, screw, or push into place and come in many different types. The most
common type used in RFID systems is SMA (SubMiniature version A). It uses a
threaded interface. SMA connectors of 50 ohms are semi-precision, subminia-
ture units that provide excellent electrical performance from DC to 18 GHz.
These high-performance connectors are compact in size and have outstanding
mechanical durability. They are intended for use on semi-rigid cables and in
components that are connected infrequently (a few hundred interconnect cy-
cles). SMA connectors come in different varieties and are available both in stan-
dard and reverse polarity,standard and reverse thread,and standard and reverse
gender. The mating connectors must form a proper pair; otherwise, they can be
permanently damaged and will need to be replaced.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 2.1: Radio Frequency Basics
RF waves are part of electromag-
netic spectrum and propagate in free space away from the source. They get
reflected, diffracted, refracted, and scattered, causing multipath. Several sig-
nal modulation and encoding schemes are used to transfer data using radio
waves. RFID systems use inductive coupling in near-field and backscatter
coupling in far-field to supply power to the tags and communicate with
them. The link budget methodology is used to calculate the distance from
the interrogator antenna at which a tag can be powered and interrogated.
RFID systems operate in unlicensed ISM bands and must follow local gov-
ernment regulations regarding usage of these bands.

✔Objective 2.2: Antenna Performance and Characteristics
Antennas con-
vert electrical energy to radio energy and radiate this energy in free space.
The efficiency with which they radiate energy depends on the type of an-
tennas and their design parameters. These parameters include resonant
frequency, bandwidth, and impedance, which are related to the frequency
of the signal for which the antenna is designed, while the gain of antenna
depends on the antenna design. Several different types of antennas are
available, but in RFID systems, the most prevalent are dipole and patch an-
tennas.
Increasing antenna gain increases its beam length but decreases its beam-
width. Different objects and their material type encountered by the RF
signals during their travel have a great effect on the power and shape of the
signals received by the receiver.
Radiated power from an antenna is related to antenna gain,the type of ca-
ble used to connect the antenna with the interrogator, and the power output
from the interrogator’s antenna terminal. Cables have losses that increase
with the length of the cable and the frequency of the signal transmitted and
decrease with the increase in diameter of the cable.The power radiated from
antenna = interrogator power – cable losses + antenna gain when all are ex-
pressed in decibel units.

9.
27 dBm = 0.5 watt, 30 dBm = 1 watt, 27 dBm = 30 dBm – 3 dB.
Subtracting 3 dB means halving the power, providing 0.5 watt.

The higher the antenna gain, the narrower the main beamwidth.
As the antenna gain is increased, the width of the main beam decreases
but its length increases.
11.
Circular polarization is the best in this situation because it will
allow the fixed antenna to couple with the rotating one, regardless of
the rotating antenna’s orientation.
12.
Minimum bending radius does not affect cable losses. It provides
a guide to the installer about how sharply the cable may be bent
without damaging it. Cable losses are directly proportional to cable
length and signal frequency and inversely proportional to cable
diameter.

RFID tags, along with interrogators, antennas, and peripheral devices, form a
physical layer of the RFID system. In Chapter 2, you read about the phenomena
of electromagnetic wave propagation and inductive and backscatter coupling.
RFID tags use these phenomena to communicate with interrogators. In this
chapter, you will read about RFID tag components and subassemblies, types of
tags and reasons for using various types of tags, tag performance parameters,
and tag selection criteria.
A tag is usually designed to suit a particular purpose, such as mounting on
metal or embedding in tires. A tag’s behavior changes according to the material
to which it is attached and the condition of the surrounding environment.
Therefore, selecting an appropriate tag for the object material and properly ap-
plying it to the object is the most important factor in the successful deployment
of an RFID system.
Objective 3.1
Tag Components
and Construction
R
FID tags are made of three different components: integrated circuit (IC),
antenna, and substrate, as shown in Figure 3-1. A tag manufacturer typi-
cally does not make all three components in-house. The IC is typically designed
and made by a semiconductor manufacturer, while an antenna is usually de-
signed and made by a tag manufacturer. Tags are available in various sizes, de-
signs, and form factors, and they can be customized for a particular application.
Unless you need a very large number of tags,you should try to use stock tags be-
cause customized tags can be very expensive.
Integrated Circuit
An IC,also called an electronic circuit,microchip,or chip,is designed and man-
ufactured by a semiconductor manufacturer.Designing ICs requires knowledge
and experience in the technology, and their manufacture requires expensive
equipment. Therefore, ICs are often designed by one company, manufactured
by another, and used by a third company that assembles the components to cre-

ate a tag. One IC may be used for many different types of tags by different tag
manufacturers.
The IC has a logic unit that makes decisions and provides memory to store
data. Actually, the IC is a small microprocessor, and the latest ones have 40,000
to 50,000 transistors,more than the original IBM PC.The IC needs power to op-
erate.This power may come from a battery on the tag (in an active tag) or it may
be obtained from the radio energy radiated by the interrogator antenna (in a
passive tag). A part of the IC is dedicated to controlling power.
The processing logic implements the communication protocol. It also is
used to modulate/demodulate signals and to encode/decode digital bits dur-
ing the communication between the interrogator and the tag. The memory on
the IC may be divided in different blocks, called banks. A block may be a
read-only type, a write-one-time-only type, or a write-many-times type. Tags
use electrically erasable, programmable, read-only memory (EEPROM). This
type of memory does not require continuous power to store data. Therefore,
data stored on the tag is retained for a long period (several years), even though
no power may be available to the tag during this period. The type of data
stored in the memory depends on the protocol used. The IC may store tag ID,
object identifier, password, and error detection code such as cyclic redun-
dancy check (CRC).

ROM and WORM
Read-only memory is called ROM and write-one-
time-only memory is called WORM, for write-once-read-many.
ICs are created on a large semiconductor wafer. One wafer can contain
40,000 ICs. Manufacturing of ICs requires state-of-the-art clean room facilities.
The finished ICs are individually tested to ensure reliable functionality in the
field. With advances in semiconductor technology, ICs are becoming
smaller—as small as a grain of sand. The smaller the IC, the lesser the cost and
power required to operate it. Making tag ICs more efficient in power usage and
requiring less power to operate increases the read range of passive tags.
The ICs on each wafer need to be cut and separated and then attached to a tag
antenna. As the size of IC decreases, it requires more precise equipment to con-
nect it to the antenna, which can increase the cost of assembling the tag.
Antenna
This section discusses a type of antenna that is mounted on the tag rather than
one connected to an interrogator.The antenna is the largest part of the tag and is
connected to the tag IC. The antenna receives the signals from the interrogator
and, depending on tag type, it either transmits or reflects the received signal
back. For active tags, it transmits the signals, and for semi-passive and passive
tags, it reflects the signals. For passive tags, the antenna also collects power from
the radio waves and supplies it to the IC.
The geometry of an antenna determines the frequency at which the tag oper-
ates. Though the tags may use the identical IC, variations in antenna design al-
low tags to have completely different properties and behaviors.The antenna can
be shaped as a spiral coil, a single dipole, dual dipoles (one perpendicular to
other), or a folded dipole. Within these basic types are many variations in an-
tenna shapes,depending on the specific requirements of the application and the
abilities of the designer. The antenna is designed for a specific frequency of op-
eration and is later tuned according to the properties of the material to be
tagged. The designated frequency determines the effective antenna length, but
the actual antenna length is typically reduced using creative antenna design. As
mentioned, the antenna is the largest component of the tag, so it determines the
physical parameters of the tag.

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
65
Antennas are usually made of thin metal strips of copper, aluminum, or sil-
ver. These strips are deposited on the substrate at high speeds, and then the IC is
attached to the antenna. The antenna can be manufactured using one of the
three different methods: copper etching, foil stamping, and screen-printing.
Screen-printing is the fastest and the least expensive of all three processes, but
the antennas created using this method are less efficient than those created by
the other two methods. Because many tags will be included in the labels and the
label makers’expertise is in printing,a screen-printed antenna using conductive
ink containing copper, nickel, or carbon would make the tag creation process
less expensive and will integrate it with the label making process.
Exam Tip
Know that the design of the antenna makes the tags behave
differently, though they may use the same IC.
Interconnection
The antenna is connected to the IC on the tag. This connection is usually the
tag’s “weakest link.”The strength of this connection greatly influences the qual-
ity and durability of the tag. Even if it is not broken, the connection can be poor
and reduce the available power to the tag or reduce the strength of the signal sent
back by the tag. Repeated heat cycling or a corrosive environment can degrade
the quality of the connection, and poor connection means lower tag perfor-
mance. The connection may become weak or even break due to repeated bend-
ing of the tag during manufacturing of smart labels or during tag application.
To avoid damage due to sharp tag bending, tag manufacturers usually specify a
minimum bending radius for their tags.
Substrate
The substrate holds all other tag components together. The tag antenna is de-
posited or printed on the substrate, and the IC is then attached to this antenna.
A substrate is usually made from flexible material such as thin plastic,but it may
also be made from rigid material. Most passive tags use substrates made from
flexible material with a thickness of 100 to 200 µm. The substrate material must
be able to withstand various environmental conditions through which the tag

66
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
may pass during its lifecycle. Some of the materials used for the substrate are
polymer, PVC, Polyethylenetherephtalate (PET), phenolics, polyesters, styrene,
and even paper. The substrate material must provide dissipation of static
buildup, a smooth printing surface for antenna layout, durability and stability
under various operating conditions,and mechanical protection for the antenna,
chip, and their interconnections. Some of the environmental conditions that
can affect the substrate are heat, moisture, vibration, chemicals, sunlight, abra-
sion, impact, and corrosion. The substrate material may affect the design fre-
quency of the antenna; therefore, the effect of substrate material must be
considered during proper tuning of the antenna.
One side of the substrate is usually coated with an adhesive material to attach
the tag to an object. The adhesive material must be able to withstand appropri-
ate environmental conditions. Sometimes, a protective overlay made from ma-
terials such as PVC lamination, epoxy resin, or adhesive paper is added to
protect the tag from environmental effects.
Tag Packaging
Tag components are packaged in various ways to make them easy to handle for
tag manufacturers with different levels of expertise in manipulating small elec-
tronic components. The manufacturing of the final tags from the various com-
ponents require organizations with expertise in semiconductor design and
manufacturing,RF devices design,manufacturing of printed circuits,and man-
ufacturing and printing of labels. Because of this complexity, tag components
are packaged into subassemblies that make tags easier to manufacture. Three
commonly used terms in tag manufacturing are strap, inlay, and smart label.
Straps
During tag manufacture, the IC is attached to the antenna. The IC is very small,
about 0.25 square mm, and it has two connection points that must be aligned
properly and connected to the antenna formed on the substrate. Due to the size
of the IC,aligning it with the antenna is difficult and requires precise and expen-
sive equipment. It also requires expertise in manipulating small components at
very high speeds. Most tag manufacturers do not have this type of expertise or
equipment. To overcome this problem, the IC manufacturers attach one con-
ductive film pad to each connection points of the IC. These pads are larger than
the IC and provide a larger area where an antenna may be attached. This subas-
sembly with the conductive film pads and the IC is called a strap and is shown in

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
67
Figure 3-2. A strap is typically supplied on a reel of continuous web to help the
manufacturer attach the antenna to it via high-speed strap attachment equip-
ment. With a larger area of strap pads, the tag manufacturer does not require as
much precision equipment and expertise in handling small parts.
Inlays
Another subassembly of tag components is called an inlay or insert. This is es-
sentially a complete tag that is usually embedded in a label. An inlay consists of
an IC,an antenna,and a continuous length of substrate to accommodate several
thousand inlays.The IC used may be part of a strap.Typically,the substrate does
not have an adhesive. The inlays are supplied on a reel of continuous web and
are used by label makers, also called converters, to embed RFID functions into
labels. The continuous form of inlays helps assemble labels on high-speed
equipment. Figure 3-3 shows a sample of inlay.
Inlays are electronic devices, and just like any other electronic device they
may fail due to improper assembly, mechanical damage, or electrostatic dis-
charge (ESD). During inlay and smart label manufacturing, the reels of inlays
are wound and unwound at high speeds.These operations may generate an ESD
and can severely damage the IC on the inlays. The amount of ESD depends on
the winding speed and tension. Manufacturers of inlays recommend using the
ESD deionization equipment during high-speed handling of the inlays.

Smart Labels
Smart labels,often called labels,are made of layers of thin sheets of various types
of materials with an RFID inlay embedded within those layers.These layers usu-
ally include the linear or carrier sheet, linear release coating, inlay adhesive, tag
inlay, face stock adhesive, label material, and label topcoat. Figure 3-4 shows a
typical smart label. Barcodes and textual information are usually printed on the
smart label material in addition to an identifying number that is encoded into
the embedded RFID inlay. The smart labels use either a direct thermal or ther-
mal transfer printing method (see Chapter 5).
FIGURE 3.3
Inlay sample
FIGURE 3.4
Smart label

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
69
Smart labels come in various sizes, and depending on the material to be
tagged, they have different types of tags embedded into them. They provide lo-
gistical information for shipping and handling of the products in the supply
chain.They allow RFID encoding to be used while retaining the current barcode
and human readable system. Smart labels are available in rolls or in fan folds.
They provide an easy way to implement RFID systems within the supply chain,
particularly for companies trying to meet the RFID mandates of their custom-
ers while simultaneously meeting their other clients’ ongoing barcoding re-
quirements.
Smart label stock received from the manufacturer can contain defective la-
bels, though the quality and yield has improved over the years. Smart labels are
also affected by ESD generated during transportation, storage, and usage. Dur-
ing encoding and application of the smart label, defective labels must be identi-
fied and discarded without disrupting the business processes using the smart
labels. Efficient ways of handling defective labels must be integrated into the
RFID system during the system design.
Encapsulated Tags
RFID inlays are sometimes encapsulated inside a hard case. The case is made of
RF translucent materials such as PET, Polypropylene (PP), Polyacetate (POM),
Polycarbonate (PC), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polyamide 66P
(A66), and Elastomère (EPDM). Tags are encapsulated to protect them from
harsh environments. For example, a tag attached to a reusable plastic container
(RPC) used in a food processing plant would encounter high temperature,pres-
sure, and steam when the container is sanitized. These tags are used to track
totes, carriers, and pallets in closed-loop systems and returnable assets in the
supply chain. Some of the cases may provide a more rugged method of tag at-
tachment, such as bolting or riveting to the object. In addition, the size and
shape of the case may be designed to provide isolation from the object so the tag
may be attached to metal objects. Figure 3-5 shows some samples of encapsu-
lated tags.

Objective 3.2
Tag Types
R
FID tags come in many different designs, shapes, and sizes. A tag is de-
signed for a particular application or a set of applications. Depending on
the object or material to which the tag is to be attached, it may require different
frequency of operation or functionality. The read range of a tag also varies with
the frequency of operation. The tag, being an electronic device, needs power to
operate, and tag design dictates the source of this power.
The tag memory may have restriction on how often it can be written to. This
may be for security reasons, so that the data, once written, cannot be changed.
Some applications may require tags to be of a certain size—for example, a laun-
dry tag embedded inside a garment should be no bigger than a button.A tag em-
bedded inside a tire must be designed to withstand high temperatures and
pressure encountered during the manufacturing of the tire. A tag mounted on a
metal object requires special design and mounting considerations.
Tags may be classified under four categories, depending on how the tags ob-
tain power,the frequency at which they operate,the protocol used, and the vari-
ous functionalities implemented on the tags.
FIGURE 3.5
Encapsulated tags

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
71
Power Source
A tag requires power to process signals received from the interrogator and to
send the data encoded signals back to the interrogator. Signals sent back may be
reflected signals or signals generated by the tag. Depending on how tags obtain
the power and how they use that power, tags are classified as the following:
•
Passive tags
•
Semi-passive tags
•
Active tags
Passive Tags
A passive tag (Figure 3-6) does not have its own power source; it has no battery
on-board. The tag obtains power from radio waves received from the interroga-
tor. The amount of power thus received is very small, just enough to energize its
IC. Therefore, passive tag functionalities are limited. Due to a lack of enough
power,it cannot support an active transmitter to communicate with the interro-
gator. The good thing about the lack of transmitter, however, is that passive tags
do not contribute to radio noise. To communicate with the interrogator, passive
tags operating at low and high frequencies use inductive coupling, while those
operating above a high frequency range use radiative coupling. (See Chapter 2
for more about these coupling methods.) Inductively coupled tags have a read
range of a few inches to about 2 feet, while radiatively coupled tags have read
range of up to 20 feet.
FIGURE 3.6
Passive tags

When a passive tag is not in an interrogation zone (IZ), which is the case
most of the time, it has no power and does nothing. Due to this, the passive tag
cannot contain any kind of sensors that require continuous power, such as tem-
perature and pressure sensors. The passive tag typically has a minimum func-
tionality of carrying and transmitting a small amount of data. It is a simple and
inexpensive device compared to active and semi-passive tags.
In RFID applications, passive RFID tags are often used. Because of their low
cost, passive tags are well suited in applications for which tags are not reusable.
The tags become part of the object to which they are attached and have the same
lifecycle as the object itself; they are not returned into circulation after the ob-
ject’s life has expired. For example, in a supply chain, a case of goods may have
passive tags attached to it; when the items are removed from the case and the
case is discarded, the tags are also discarded. This makes economic sense due to
the low cost of the passive tag.
The following table lists some of advantages and disadvantages of passive
tags.
Advantages
Disadvantages
Small size
Requires presence of interrogator
to work
Lightweight
Limited amount data storage
Inexpensive (depends on quantity)
Require higher power interrogators
Does not add to radio noise
Low read range (few inches to 20 feet)
Longer life (20-plus years)
Resistance to harsh environment
Travel Advisory
A low read range might be considered an advantage or a disadvantage,
depending on a tag’s application. When a tag is used for a credit card or for an
access control card, a low read range is an advantage, because you do not want
somebody to be able to read your personal card from 20 feet away. However,
when used in a supply chain to tag a pallet, a low read range is a disadvantage
because it is difficult and dangerous for a forklift to pass repeatedly very close
to the interrogator antenna. Due to the recent hype about using RFID tags in a
supply chain, where longer read range is an advantage, and due to the general
mentality that bigger is better, people usually consider a low read range
a disadvantage. To stay in synch with the RFID industry, this book
also assumes that a lower read range is a disadvantage, but it also
points out where a longer read range can be a disadvantage.

Semi-Passive Tags
Semi-passive tags (Figure 3-7) are also called semi-active, battery-assisted pas-
sive (BAP), or battery-assisted tags (BATs). This tag has an on-board battery to
power its IC, but, like a passive tag, it does not have an active transmitter. It uses
backscatter to communicate with the interrogator.It modulates the reflection of
the waves from the interrogator and requires an interrogator to send data. Since
no transmitter is present, it also does not contribute to radio noise. This type of
tag is used because it can provide a longer read range than a passive tag and can
accommodate environmental sensors on-board. The sensor on the tag helps re-
cord the environmental experience of the object to which the tag is attached.
You may wonder why the semi-passive tag includes a battery. First, the bat-
tery provides power to the IC so the tag does not depend on the interrogator to
power it. If you recall the discussion on link budget in Chapter 2, you’ll remem-
ber the forward link and return link budgets.The forward link is used to provide
power to the tag and to communicate with the tag, and it has a smaller range
than the return link. The return link, which includes a round trip from interro-
gator to tag and back to interrogator, still has a longer range than the forward
link. This means that the limiting factor for a read range of a passive tag is how
far away from the antenna a tag can be powered, not how far away from the an-
tenna the signals can be decoded. With that in mind, if we provide a battery to
power the IC, we can extend the read range of the passive tag. Therefore, by
slightly modifying the passive tag to accept the power from on-board battery,we
can increase its read range.
CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge

FIGURE 3.7
Semi-passive tags

The second reason to have a battery on the tag is to attach an environmental
sensor to the tag. Environmental sensors require reliable continuous power to
operate, and they require a higher power level than the tag IC. The passive tag
cannot have reliable and continuous power because it gets power only when it is
in the IZ, which is not the case most of the time. In addition, when it gets the
power inside the IZ, it is very limited—not enough to power an on-board sen-
sor. Therefore, if a battery is added to the tag, the sensors and the tag IC can use
that power,which is available all the time.The sensors on the tag can collect data
and transmit that data along with the identifying number when the tag is inter-
rogated.This is a valuable prospect,because,for example,it allows you to collect
the temperature experience of the object automatically as the object moves
around during its lifecycle. Therefore, when a case of temperature-sensitive
drugs is transported,you can collect a record of how long the case was subjected
to the temperatures beyond certain set limits and dynamically calculate its ex-
piry date or its potency. Frozen food storage conditions can be easily monitored
using this type of tag. Temperature, pressure, relative humidity, acceleration, vi-
bration, motion, altitude, and chemical sensors can all be placed on a tag.
The extra functionalities of an on-tag battery do not come without cost,
however. The battery creates a few problems, such as extra weight, larger size,
higher cost, shorter life, and temperature sensitivity. An integrated battery
means the tag dies when the battery dies, and a replaceable battery means larger
size and weight for the battery compartment. How do you know when a battery
is drained? The interrogator can never detect a tag that does not respond. If the
object with the tag is sitting outdoors in below-freezing temperatures, the bat-
tery may not work and the tag will not respond. Batteries on tags have a typical
maximum shelf life of 2 to 7 years, but when tags are used and interrogated fre-
quently, the batteries can quickly be depleted.
The following table lists some of advantages and disadvantages of semi-pas-
sive tags.

You may also ask, “Why not put an active transmitter on semi-passive tags?”
An active transmitter requires a lot more electronics on the tags as well as a larger
power source.This would make the tags bigger,heavier,and costlier.If you need to
acquire data only when the tags are in the IZ,why pay for the extra functionality?
Exam Tip
Know that tags with batteries on them may not work when they are
exposed to subfreezing temperature for an extended period.
Active Tags
An active tag (Figure 3-8) has an on-board power source,usually a battery,and an
active transmitter. The IC of this tag may contain more processing power to im-
plement additional functionalities such as data manipulation. This tag uses the
battery to power its IC and transmitter. It does not need emitted power or radio
signals from the interrogator to transmit its data. Actually, it does not even need
an interrogator.An active tag may be set to broadcast its data at a preset time,peri-
odically, or on occurrence of a certain event. Its typical read range is 300 to 750
feet. The read range depends on the battery power and type of transmitter on the
tag. An active tag, like a semi-passive tag, may have on-board sensors or external
sensors connected to it. With more processing power, the tag may collect data
from the sensors and locally process the data before broadcasting. Active tags are
oftenusedbyrealtimelocationsystems(RTLSs).(RTLSisdiscussedinChapter5.)

MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
An active tag can communicate with other active tags with or without the
presence of an interrogator. It does not communicate with passive or semi-pas-
sive tags. An active tag can be designed to broadcast its data using broadband or
spread-spectrum technologies to enhance its data communication perfor-
mance. It can be set to a sleep mode in which it uses only a small amount of
power and does not transmit data. When it receives a specific signal, it awakens
and transmits its data. This reduces the power usage from the battery and ex-
tends battery life. Some active tags work at two different frequencies. At the
lower of the two frequencies, they work in receive only mode and use this mode
to receive a signal from a nearby transmitter. This signal awakens the tag, and
then the tag transmits its data at higher frequency and longer range. During this
transmission, it may also transmit the identity of the device that awakened it.
This is typically used within a large container yard where you want to track the
movement of the container from one zone to another. The tag may also be set to
transmit a periodic beacon to let an interrogator know of its existence or send
the signal when moved or handled. It can even send a low battery alert. The US
Department of Defense has been using this type of tag for many years.
The advantages and disadvantages of active tags are similar to those of
semi-passive tags and are listed in the following table:

Exam Tip
Remember that passive and semi-passive tags use backscatter to
communicate while active tags use on-board radio to communicate.

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge

Tag Frequencies
RFID tags are categorized according to the frequency at which they are designed
to operate. Four primary frequency ranges are allocated by various government
authorities for use by RFID systems.
•
Low frequency (LF)
•
High frequency (HF)
•
Ultra high frequency (UHF)
•
Microwave frequency (microwave)
All of these ranges are part of the frequency bands called Industrial, Scien-
tific, and Medical (ISM) radio bands and were originally reserved for non-com-
mercial use.Depending on the usage,the tags are designed to operate in any one
of these ranges. The material of the object being tagged and the read range re-
quired are the main factors in selection of frequency.Objects with water content
absorb frequencies in certain ranges but have no effect on frequencies in an-
other range.
Low Frequency (LF) Tags
Low frequency range includes frequencies from 30 to 300 kHz but only 125 kHz
and 134 kHz (actually, 134.2 kHz) are used for RFID. This range has been in use
for RFID tags for animal tracking since 1979 and is the most mature range in
use. It is available for RFID use all over the world. The tags in this range are gen-
erally called LF tags.They use near-field inductive coupling to obtain power and
to communicate with the interrogator. The LF tags are passive tags (no battery
and transmitter on the tag) and have a short read range of a few inches. They
have the lowest data transfer rate among all the RFID frequencies and usually
store a small amount of data.The LF tags have no or limited anti-collision capa-
bilities; therefore, reading multiple tags simultaneously in the IZ is impossible
or very difficult. The tag antennas are usually made of a copper coil with hun-
dreds of turns wound around a ferrous core.They are expensive to manufacture,
and tags using them are thicker than others at higher frequencies. The LF tags
can be easily read while attached to objects containing water, animal tissues,
metal, wood, and liquids.

LF tags (Figure 3-9) have the largest installed base. They are used in access
control, asset tracking, animal identification, automotive control, as vehicle
immobilizers, healthcare, and various point-of-sale applications (such as
Mobil/Exxon SpeedPass). The automotive industry is the largest user of LF tags.
For example, in an automobile vehicle immobilizer system, an LF tag is embed-
ded inside the ignition key. When that key is used to start the car, an RFID inter-
rogator placed around the key slot reads the tag ID. If the tag ID is correct, the
car can be started. If the ID is incorrect or no tag is found, the car cannot be
started.
High Frequency (HF) Tags
The high frequency range includes frequencies from 3 to 30 MHz but only one
frequency, 13.56 MHz, is used for RFID applications. This frequency is now
available for RFID applications worldwide with the same power level. Tags and
interrogators using 13.56 MHz are generally called the HF tags and the HF inter-
rogators. They, like the LF tags, also use near-field inductive coupling to obtain
power and to communicate with the interrogator. HF tags are passive tags and
have short read range, less than 3 feet. They have a lower data transfer rate than
the UHF frequencies but a higher data rate than the LF. The HF tags may have
anti-collision capability that facilitates reading of multiple tags simultaneously
in the IZ. Since the read range of many HF tags and interrogators is small, they
usually do not implement anti-collision. This reduces the complexity and cost.
78
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
FIGURE 3.9
LF tags are embedded in these keys

Some HF tags can store up to 4K of data. HF tags are more mature than UHF
tags and many standards are in place.
HF tag antennas are usually made of a copper, aluminum, or silver coil with
three to seven turns. They are easy to manufacture, and the tags are usually very
thin, almost two-dimensional. HF tags are lower in cost due to simpler antenna
design than LF tags. They can be made in different sizes, some less than a half
inch in diameter. HF tags can be easily read while attached to objects containing
water,tissues,metal,wood,and liquids.They are affected by metal objects in the
close vicinity, however. HF interrogators are less complex than UHF interroga-
tors and usually cost less than the latter.
Inductive coupling used by the HF interrogators uses magnetic flux to power
and communicate with the tags. Magnetic flux is omnidirectional (not direc-
tional) and therefore it covers the entire area, surrounding its source evenly.
That means there are no holes in its density. This makes HF tags an ideal choice
for applications such as a smart shelf, for which the entire shelf area needs to be
covered with magnetic flux so all the items on the shelf can be interrogated.
Other applications of the HF tags include credit cards, smart cards, library
books, airline baggage, and asset tracking. Due to the absence of restrictions on
the use of the HF frequency and the popularity of smart cards, HF tags are cur-
rently the most widely used tags around the world. Figure 3-10 shows HF tags.
CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
79
FIGURE 3.10
HF tags

Exam Tip
You should know that an HF tag has an antenna with three to seven
turns of coil, while an LF tag antenna has several hundred turns
of coil.
Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Tags
The ultra high frequency range includes frequencies from 300 to 1000 MHz, but
only two frequency ranges,433 MHz and 860–960 MHz,are used for RFID appli-
cations. The 433 MHz frequency is used for active tags, while the 860–960 MHz
range is used mostly for passive tags and some semi-passive tags. The frequency
range of 860–960 MHz is often referred to by a single frequency of 900 or 915
MHz. Tags and interrogators in this range are called UHF tags and UHF interro-
gators. The passive and the semi-passive tags in this frequency range use far-field
radiative coupling, or backscatter coupling. The UHF tags have a read range of
about 15 to 20 feet.All the protocols in the UHF range have some type of anti-col-
lision capability, allowing multiple tags to be read simultaneously in the IZ. The
new Gen 2 protocol for UHF tags is designed for reading several hundred tags per
second. UHF interrogators are usually costlier than HF interrogators, but UHF
tags are becoming more economical. Figure 3-11 shows some UHF tags.

FIGURE 3.11
UHF tags

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
81
The UHF tag antennas are usually made of a copper, aluminum, or silver
deposited on the substrate. Their effective length is approximately 6.5 inches,
which is approximately equal to one-half the wavelength of 900 MHz radio
waves. The optimum length of an UHF antenna is equal to one-half the wave-
length of the carrier wave, though with proper design, the length can be re-
duced. The UHF antennas are thin and easy to manufacture, allowing tags to
be very thin, less than 100 µM, almost two-dimensional. The UHF tags cannot be
easily read while attached to objects containing water and animal tissues
because water absorbs UHF waves as well as detunes the tag. The UHF tags
also get detuned when they are attached to metal objects. Separating UHF tags
from the metal objects or objects with liquid improves their performance.
UHF tags cannot be read if water or any conductive material is placed between
the interrogator antenna and the tags.
Radiative coupling used by the UHF interrogators uses radio waves to power
and communicate with the tags. Reflection, diffraction, and refraction of radio
waves gives rise to a multipath effect, where radio signals arrive at the receiver
using multiple paths. Some of the signals from multipath attenuate the original
signal.This creates an IZ with varying signal strength.The tags may not be read-
able in low signal spots, causing random tag readability problems. The UHF an-
tennas are directional, which helps create an IZ with well-defined boundaries,
though the zone may have holes in it. UHF tags are getting a big boost from the
mandates by large organizations for their use in the supply chain. This and the
creation of the Gen 2 protocol have created a tremendous momentum in RFID
industry to manufacture low-cost UHF tags in high volume.
UHF frequency regulations are not as uniform as HF frequency regulations.
Governments in various parts of the world had assigned the UHF frequencies at
around 900 MHz, long before RFID, for uses other than for RFID. Therefore,
there is no common frequency range around 900 MHz available for RFID use.
Different countries have different bands available with varying allowable maxi-
mum power levels and duty cycles. To overcome this problem, the Gen 2 proto-
col was designed to work with any frequency band within the 860–960 MHz
range and with different maximum power levels. The government regulations
divide the allocated frequency range into a number of narrower frequency
bands. These narrower bands are called channels. Different countries have dif-
ferent numbers of channels available within their allocated bandwidths. The
regulations also require that the interrogators do not use a single channel all the
time but pseudorandomly hop among the available channels.

The following table shows allocated band size, maximum allowable power,
and number of channels allocated in a few countries. Some countries use effec-
tive isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for maximum power specifications, while
the others use effective radiated power (ERP). The difference between them is
discussed in Chapter 2.

Microwave Tags
The microwave frequency range includes frequencies from 1 to 10 GHz, but
only two frequency ranges around 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz are used for RFID ap-
plications. Almost all microwave tags use 2.45 GHz. Microwave tags are avail-
able as passive, semi-passive, and active types. The passive and semi-passive tags
use backscatter coupling to communicate with interrogators, and active types
use their own transmitter to communicate. Passive microwave tags are usually
smaller than passive UHF tags and have the same read range of about 15 feet.
The semi-passive microwave tags have a read range of about 100 feet, while the
active microwave tags have read range of about 350 feet.Passive microwave tags,
due to low demand, are more expensive than passive UHF tags, but they share
the same advantages and disadvantages. Only a few manufacturers make this
type of tag. Japan is the largest user of passive microwave tags.
Microwave antennas are directional, which helps define the IZ for passive
and semi-passive tags. Due to their shorter wavelength, they are easier to design
to work with metallic objects.A wider band of frequencies is available to use and
more hop channels are available. However, many commonly used devices such
as cordless phones and microwave ovens use this frequency. Therefore, interfer-
ence at microwave frequencies is possible. Government regulations regarding

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
83
use of microwave frequencies for RFID are almost nonexistent. The semi-pas-
sive microwave RFID tags are used in long-range access control for vehicles,fleet
identification, and highway toll collection. Active microwave tags are used for
real time location systems (RTLS). Figure 3-12 shows a microwave tag.
Exam Tip
Remember that UHF and microwave tags have dipole antennas.
Tag Communication Methods
The interrogators and tags communicate using various methods, depending on
tag design parameters such as frequency of operation and source of power. Pas-
sive and semi-passive UHF and microwave tags use radiative coupling, and pas-
sive LF and HF tags use inductive coupling for communication.Active UHF and
microwave tags include their own transmitters.The communication method af-
fects the performance of the tag, dictating the maximum read range and consis-
tency of read within that range.
FIGURE 3.12
Microwave tag

The inductive coupling employed by LF and HF tags uses magnetic flux to
power the passive tags and communicate with them. The electromagnetic flux
strength of inductive coupling decreases by the sixth power of the distance be-
tween the tag and the antenna.This provides a very short read range for induc-
tively coupled tags. The radiative coupling employed by UHF and microwave
tags uses radio waves to power the passive tags and to communicate with
them. Radiative coupling provides a longer read range than inductive cou-
pling because the radio wave strength decreases by only the second power of
the distance between the antenna and the tag. Radiatively coupled tags use
modulated backscatter on a downlink communication. (Backscatter was dis-
cussed in Chapter 2.) Active tags use their radio at the designated frequency,
usually 433 MHz or 2.4 GHz, to transmit data with or without the presence of
an interrogator. They can transmit and receive data to and from other active
tags within their radio range.
Functionality: EPCglobal Tag Classes
Standards organization EPCglobal has categorized RFID tags into six different
classes according to the following functionalities implemented on the tag:
•
Write capability
•
Power source
•
Memory capacity
•
Communication capability
These tag classes are numbered from 0 to 5. The following table provides a brief
description of each class:
Class
Description
Class 0
Passive, data written once during manufacture, read only
Class 1
Passive, factory or field programmable once only, read
only thereafter
Class 2
Passive, read/write, user memory and encryption
Class 3
Semi-passive, on-board sensors, read/write, user memory
Class 4
Active, read/write, on-board sensors, peer-to-peer
communication with other active tags in same frequency
band and with interrogators
Class 5
Essentially the interrogator, read/write, can power classes
0, 1, 2, and 3 tags, can wirelessly communicate with all the
classes
84
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
85
The classes 0, 1, and 2 are all passive tags with various write and memory ca-
pabilities. The class 3 tags are semi-passive tags and may have an on-board sen-
sor. All the tags in classes 0, 1, 2, and 3 can communicate only with class 5. The
class 4 tags are active tags and can communicate with any class 4 or 5 device. A
class 5 device is an interrogator and can communicate with any class.
Over time, some manufacturers have added functionalities to tags and
started assigning their own class numbers, such as class 0+ tags, making the dis-
tinction between passive tag classes 0 through 2 become somewhat fuzzy.As you
will see in the next section, even the EPCglobal Gen 2 protocol does not follow
the five-class classification: semi-passive tags are still referred to as class 3 tags
and active tags are referred to as class 4 tags.
Protocols
Protocols are the definition and grammar of the language used by the interroga-
tors and tags to communicate with each other. The interrogator and tag must
use the same protocol to communicate.The interrogator may have multi-proto-
col capability, but it uses only one protocol at a time. Typically, a multi-protocol
interrogator is set to a single protocol, or it may cycle through several protocols
one by one. Protocols may be designed by a manufacturer or by a standards or-
ganization. Manufacturer designed protocols are usually proprietary and may
not be available to all the manufacturers. Protocols designed by a standards or-
ganization are called open protocols and are available on equal terms to all manu-
facturers. For this reason, it is always a good idea to purchase equipment that
uses an open and popular protocol; it increases the availability and compatibil-
ity of the equipment and helps protect your investment.The protocols define air
interface—that is, how a tag and an interrogator communicate using electro-
magnetic waves. This includes frequency of operation, emission power level,
data rate, signal modulation, encoding of data bits, data structure, command
structure, and anti-collision algorithm.
Examples of proprietary protocols include Philips I-Code, TI Tag-It, Alien
EPC Class 1, Matrics EPC Class 0, and Intermec IntelliTag. Examples of open
protocols are ISO 14443 (A/B), ISO 15693, ISO 18000-6 (A/B), and EPCglobal
Class 1 Generation 2 (Gen 2).
Gen 2 Protocol
The official name of this protocol is Class-1 Generation-2 UHF RFID Proto-
col, but it is usually referred to as Gen 2, C1G2, or Generation 2 protocol. It
was developed by EPCglobal, Inc., and published in December 2004. It was

submitted to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in
March 2005 for approval as an ISO standard and was approved as ISO
18000-6C standard in July 2006.
More than 50 companies from various industries provided input for devel-
opment of Gen 2 protocol. It is designed to work globally regardless of the local
UHF regulations. This is the most important aspect of this protocol, because
UHF regulations vary from country to country. In global commerce, items
move from country to country; therefore, the tags attached to the items in one
country must be readable in any other country regardless of that country’s regu-
lations. The UHF range was broadened to include regulations of all the coun-
tries. The Gen 2 protocol is designed to work at frequencies from 860 to 960
MHz with various levels of power and duty cycle. Gen 2–compliant interroga-
tors are designed to work in a particular country according to that country’s
UHF radio regulations. Gen 2–compliant tags are designed to work at any fre-
quency between 860 and 960 MHz.Therefore,Gen 2 tags can be read by any Gen
2 interrogator in any country.
The Class 1 Generation 2 protocol defines tags to have multiple read/write
capability. According to EPC tag classification, multiple read/write capability
belongs to Class 2. This shows that with the creation of the Gen 2 protocol, the
passive UHF tag classifications have taken a back seat. Gen 2 is an open protocol
that promises interoperability between interrogators and tags designed and
manufactured by different manufacturers anywhere in the world. With the
availability of open and globally applicable protocols, all today’s manufacturers
are producing Gen 2 interrogators and tags.
EPCglobal has created a Gen 2 compliance certification program whereby
manufacturers can get their products certified for Gen 2 compliance. A Gen
2–certified interrogator from one manufacturer will be able to read Gen 2–cer-
tified tags from another manufacturer. The Gen 2 protocol is discussed in more
detail in Chapter 10.
Objective 3.3
Tag Performance
T
ag performance is measured using many different parameters, including
read rate, read distance, yield, and consistency. All these parameters are af-
fected by tag design, tag manufacturing processes used and quality control dur-
ing manufacturing, tag orientation, tag placement, material tagged, tag motion

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge

in the IZ, and environmental characteristics of the IZ. With so many variables
affecting tag performance, it is difficult to evaluate tag performance. It requires
expertise in electromagnetic wave communication and a proper test design and
setup. The following sections discuss the effects of various parameters on tag
performance.
With the current manufacturing processes, tag quality can vary from one
batch to the next or even from one tag to the next. This makes it difficult to ex-
trapolate results of tag tests to a larger population of identical tag types. The
best way to deal with this situation is to test several tags and average of their
performance. This, of course, makes tag testing a tedious and resource-inten-
sive activity.
Power Source
RFID tags may be powered by an on-board battery or by an external power
source. The external power is usually delivered via magnetic flux or radio waves.
The magnetic flux creates a uniform density zone, allowing tags to be powered
consistently within the zone. Radio waves, used by UHF and microwave tag,
create a zone of radio signals that is affected by reflected waves from surround-
ing objects. The field density varies unpredictably within the zone. Therefore,
depending on the tag location within the zone, the tag may or may not receive
strong enough radio waves to power itself. The active tag with an on-board bat-
tery transmits radio waves with a consistent strength, except when the battery
strength decreases. The battery power may decrease because of normal power
drain or due to low temperatures. In subfreezing temperatures, battery effi-
ciency greatly decreases,which may cause the active tags to transmit signals with
such a low strength that the interrogator may not receive a strong enough signal
to extract data, making the tag unreadable.
Tag Orientation and Location
Tag performance is affected by the orientation of the tag relative to the interro-
gator antenna. The best tag orientation occurs when the tag plane and the an-
tenna plane are parallel to each other. At this orientation, the tags receive the
maximum power. As the tag is rotated, it presents a smaller effective area to the
incoming radio waves and thus collects less power. The tag read range decreases
as the collected power decreases.
Most passive UHF tags have a single dipole antenna that has nulls along its
north and south poles. This type of tag cannot be read when the axis passing
through the poles of the antenna is perpendicular to the plane of the interrogator

antenna. Two options are available to remedy this situation: install two interroga-
tor antennas—one perpendicular to the other—so the tag antenna axis is not per-
pendicular to the plane of at least one of the interrogator antennas. Or, use tags
with two dipole antennas (a dual dipole tag), with one antenna perpendicular to
the other.The axis of at least one of the two antennas on this tag will never be per-
pendicular to the interrogator antenna plane.
The location of the tag within the IZ also affects the tag’s performance.As the
tag moves away from the interrogator antenna, it receives less and less power.
The reflected signals mixing with the original signal further reduces the power
available to the tag. At the outer edges of the IZ, signal strength may decrease in
pockets to such a low degree that the tag may not be powered and the consis-
tency of the tag read decreases.
Tag Placement
Placement of the tag on an object affects the tag’s performance. Placement is an
important consideration for passive UHF and microwave tags used for the prod-
ucts containing aqueous liquids, such as wine bottles, shampoo bottles, many
drugs in liquid form, and most food items. Radio waves at UHF and microwave
frequencies are absorbed by the water. To read UHF tags attached to packaging
containing aqueous liquids, the tag must be placed so that an air gap exists be-
tween the tag and the aqueous liquid. You can design the tag so that its antenna is
always pointed away from the liquids, or you can take advantage of the way the
liquids are packaged so that the tag is attached to the container away from the liq-
uids in the container. At case-level tagging, as opposed to item-level tagging, the
tag is attached to the case. The best place to attach a passive UHF tag on cases is
where the item packaging provides the most separation from the liquids inside.
This may require a very precise tag placement,with a tolerance of only a few milli-
meters.The best way to determine the best tag location is to experiment with vari-
ous tags and locations.You can also use services of RFID labs,which can help you
determine the best tag placement on your product using various test methods.
Tag Stacking
Tag stacking occurs when several tags are placed close to each other in almost an
identical orientation, such as when small items are tagged and then packed in a
case. In this situation, the tags in the front of the case, closer to the antenna, ab-
sorb and reflect most of the radio energy, so the tags on the middle items receive
a very weak signal and are not powered up, and thus cannot be read. To avoid
this problem, you can change the packaging method or rotate the case in front
of several antennas installed at various angles to the case. Tag stacking is also re-
ferred to as tag shadowing.

Interrogator antennas are designed to be linearly or circularly polarized. Lin-
early polarized antennas can be installed in a horizontal or vertical polarization
position. Circularly polarized antennas can have right-hand or left-hand circu-
lar polarization. For a linearly polarized antenna, orientation of its polarization
must match with the orientation of the tag. A tag in a horizontal position there-
fore cannot be read by a vertically polarized antenna and vice versa. The circu-
larly polarized antenna can read a tag in any orientation but at the expense of
the amount of power received by the tag. A circularly polarized antenna splits
transmitted power into two planes, one perpendicular to the other. A tag there-
fore receives only half the power relative to what it would receive from a similar
linearly polarized antenna, which in turn reduces the tag read range. You gain
tag orientation insensitivity but you lose some read range.
Circularly polarized antennas are most common in dock door applications,
where tag orientation cannot be controlled. Linearly polarized antennas are
sometimes used for conveyors in manufacturing environments. If the read
range is not a factor,it is best to use circularly polarized antennas when possible.
Tag Speed
The speed at which tags pass through the IZ affects the number of tags that can
be read in a particular time interval (usually measured in seconds). The length
of time a tag spends in the IZ is called dwell time. By knowing the dimensions of
the IZ and direction and speed of tag travel, you can calculate dwell time. The
interrogator specifications should supply the number of tags it can read in 1 sec-
ond. This number is usually not very accurate to use however, because the man-
ufacturer does not provide details regarding how that number was calculated. A
single tag within an IZ may be read, for example, 1000 times per second, but
when multiple tags are placed in the IZ at the same time, that number does not
scale. With more than one tag in the zone, the interrogator has to use an
anti-collision algorithm to singulate the tags before reading them. The time re-
quired by an anti-collision algorithm increases with the increase in the number
of tags in the zone. Therefore, for example, a single tag in the IZ may be read
1000 times per second, but 200 tags in the zone cannot be read in 0.2 second; it
will take much longer to read this number of tags. The best way to determine
how many tags an interrogator can read is by conducting a well-defined and
controlled experiment in the operating environment. Once you have a reason-
able estimate of this number and you know the dwell time and the maximum
number of tags in the zone, you can determine whether you will be able to read
all the required tags.

Exam Tip
Know that dwell time = interrogation zone length / travel speed of tag.
Environmental Factors
Environmental factors such as radio interference and humidity can affect tag
performance. Radio interference may be constant or random and may come
from external or internal sources. The external interference may be due to geog-
raphy of the facility and use of various radio devices near the facility. These in-
terferences are predictable but not easily controllable. You may have to install
radio energy shielding material around the IZ. The internal interference may be
due to improper installation or operation of some radio devices, or it may be
due to reflection from nearby objects. A proper installation and some fine-tun-
ing at the IZ can help eliminate or reduce these internal interferences. The most
difficult to deal with are random occurrences, which require a careful study and
may involve much trial and error before they are eliminated.
The humidity in the air may not directly affect the performance of the tag.
However, when tags are attached to objects that absorb humidity from air, the
tags’ performance may vary with humidity. Cold tags passing through high
humidity areas may develop condensation, which may reduce tag perfor-
mance.
Read vs. Write
All tags require more power, sometimes twice as much, to write data than to
read it. This reduces the tag’s write range. If you have configured the IZ using a
maximum read range, you will not be able to write to the tags at this distance.
You must design the IZ for writing to the tag differently than your design for
reading the tags. Interrogators also require more time to write data to a tag than
to read data from a tag.An interrogator may be able to read 1000 tags per second
but may write only 10 tags per second. In addition, you may be applying tags or
labels while writing to tags. The applicator may apply only one or two tags per
second. Therefore, a tag writing station must be designed specifically for that
purpose.

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge

Objective 3.4
Tag Selection
S
electing a proper tag is no simple task. It requires a thorough understanding
of how tags and interrogators work and an understanding of the business
processes performed on the objects to be tagged. You must understand tag and
interrogator specifications and their impact on tag performance. Some of the
factors considered during tag selection are tag type, operating frequency, mate-
rials to be tagged, tag mounting method, read range, read rate, tag size, environ-
mental conditions, cost, and mandated requirements.
Frequencies
Selection of tag frequency depends on factors such as read range requirements,ma-
terial to be tagged, and data rate. Applications such as access control and payment
systems require a very small read range. In these types of applications, reading tags
beyond a few inches creates a security risk, and therefore the read range must not
extend beyond a few inches. LF and HF tags with shorter read ranges are ideally
suitedforsuchapplications.Intaggingpalletsusedinasupplychain,areadrangeof
5to10feetisrequired.UHFandmicrowavetagsarewellsuitedforthisapplication.
Items with aqueous content require separation between the item and UHF or
microwave tag.At the item level,few choices for tag placement are available and less
opportunity exists to create an air gap between the tag and the object.In this type of
situation, an HF tag with 2 to 3 feet of read range is an ideal choice. HF and LF tags
are well suited for tracking humans and animals because living bodies have a high
watercontent.TheFDAhasapprovedLFtagsforhumanandanimalimplantation.
Objects with metals pose a special problem to tagging. Tags directly attached
to metal objects are detuned and cannot work well regardless of the tag fre-
quency. If UHF and microwave tags are attached to metal with a small air gap
between the tag and the object, they can be easily read. LF and HF tags are more
sensitive to metal and require a larger air gap.
Tag Type
The factors affecting tag type selection are read range requirements, sensor re-
quirement, cost, size, weight, and the type of application. Passive tags are
cheaper than semi-passive or active tags. Tag cost should be considered relative

to the cost of the items being tagged.For example,a $100 active tag attached to a
container is economical, while a 25 cent tag attached to a box of cereal may not
be. Some applications dictate the type of tags used. For example, to monitor
temperature within a refrigerated truck, you would need semi-passive or active
tags with temperature sensors. To monitor security and integrity of a shipping
container, an active tag with an intrusion sensor may be used. A reusable tote or
plastic container used in a manufacturing or food-processing plant may be fit-
ted with a semi-passive tag. Since these totes and containers re-circulate inside
the plant, the cost of the tag is not a major concern.
Travel Advisory
When selecting a tag, consider the cost of applying the tag to the
object.
Environmental Factors
The environmental conditions that the tag may encounter during its lifetime are
major considerations in tag selection. A tag embedded within the product may
encounter high temperatures and pressures during product manufacturing,
and it must be able to survive those conditions. Evaluate environmental condi-
tions not only within your own facility but also in any environment the tag will
travel through during its entire lifetime. These environmental conditions may
affect the tag’s read range or read rate:
•
The substrate may absorb moisture or may become brittle
and crack.
•
The adhesive may not hold the tag due to moisture or chemicals
and the tag may fall off the item.
•
The interconnection between the antenna and the IC may break due
to vibration or due to repeated flexing of the tag.
•
The antenna may be weakened due to corrosive effects of the
chemicals in the environment.
You may need to encapsulate tags to protect them from abrasion or chemicals in
the environment.

RFID Standards Compliance
Tags may be selected for compliance with certain standards. The standards may
be open, such as ISO, or they may be proprietary. It is a good practice to follow
the open and popular standards, because more companies manufacturing
products use these standards than proprietary ones, providing a wider choice of
products.In addition,these products may be cheaper due to higher volume,and
support for them may be available for a longer period.With the wide acceptance
of Gen 2 standards,it is best to use Gen 2–compliant products if you are going to
use UHF.
Compliance Requirements
Many large organizations and government agencies have mandated that their
suppliers provide goods with RFID tags. These published mandates may specify
tag type, frequency, amount of memory, read range, read rate and speed, and
protocol. In addition, the mandates may specify how the goods should be
tagged.If you are supplying goods to one of the mandating companies,you have
little choice in tag selection. The frequency and tag types are specified in the
mandates. You may select tag manufacturer and tag model depending on the
materials being tagged and the location of the tag on the goods.

tion to tag selection.

These specifications provide details about the physical size of the tag. The
UHF tags are EPC Gen 2 compliant and have 96 bits of memory in which the
user can write data. Data can be written to the tag 1000 times. Although some
manufacturers quote 10,000 times, a typical UHF tag data may need to be writ-
ten to only a few times,so 1000 times is more than adequate for the vast majority
of applications.The storage temperature of tags on a reel is lower than the storage
temperature of a single tag because the expansion due to higher temperatures
may stress the tags on the reel.Minimum bending radius is provided for use of a
tag roll in high-speed equipment. Die height is the height of the IC above the
substrate.

This tag operates at two frequencies.At 433.92 MHz,it transmits and receives
data and has a range of up to 300 feet, while at 123 kHz it only receives data and
has a range of 12 feet. It has a beeper to locate the tag. Many specifications are
provided as conforming to applicable standards. It has a replaceable battery
with a five-year life if the data is collected only twice a day. A more frequent data
collection will provide a shorter battery life. It has 128K of user programmable
memory. This is a lot of memory (compare that to the original IBM PC, with
64K of memory).
Travel Advisory
Never select a tag based only on its specifications. Always test
several samples with the objects to be tagged in the actual
environment in your facility.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 3.1: Tag Components and Construction
RFID tags (also called
inlays) are made of three different components: an integrated circuit (IC),
an antenna (coil or dipole antenna), and a substrate. An IC can be attached
to an antenna either directly or using a strap. Inlay can be used “as-is” as an
insert, attached to a label with adhesive to create a smart label, or embedded
in RF-transparent material to form an encapsulated tag.
✔Objective 3.2: Tag Types
Tags come in three different types: passive,
semi-passive, and active. Passive tags do not use a battery or transmitter.
They collect power from the reader.Semi-passive tags have an on-board bat-
tery to power them but have no transmitter.In addition,they may contain an
on-board sensor.They have a read range of up to 100 feet.Active tags have an
on-board battery and a transmitter. Their read range is up to 600 feet. They
may transmit data with or without the presence of an interrogator.
Tags also vary by operating frequency and communication methods. In-
ductively coupled tags operate at LH and HF. Their antennas are in the form
of a coil with three to several hundred turns. Their read range is less than 3

CHAPTER 3 Tag Knowledge
97
feet. Backscatter coupled tags operate at UHF and microwave frequencies.
Their antennas are usually dipole type and their read range is up to 15 feet.
Inductively coupled tags use magnetic flux while backscatter coupled tags
use radio waves.
Tags can be classed according to standards and protocols. Tags can follow
either open (such as ISO or EPC) or proprietary (manufacturer) standards.
EPC tags fall into classes according to their capabilities; the newest is the
EPC Class 1 Generation 2.
✔Objective 3.3: Tag Performance
The orientation of the tag relative to the
interrogator antenna affects the tag’s read performance. The best tag orien-
tation is a tag plane parallel to the antenna plane. The worst orientation is a
tag antenna axis that is perpendicular to the antenna plane.The location of a
tag within the IZ dictates how far the tag can be read,because the strength of
radio waves decreases as the antenna is moved away from the axis perpendic-
ular to the antenna plane. Circularly polarized antennas are less sensitive to
tag orientation.The tag orientation must match with a linearly polarized an-
tenna for the tag to be read.
The content of the package to be tagged affects the read performance of
the tag. If the package contains objects with aqueous substances, the sub-
stance will absorb the radio waves and decrease tag read range. Metal in the
package may detune the tag and reduce the tag performance.Both metal and
aqueous substances in the package will not allow radio waves to pass
through. This would affect other tags behind such a package.
✔Objective 3.4: Tag Selection
Many tag selection criteria include tag type,
operating frequency, materials to be tagged, tag mounting method, read
range, read rate, tag size, environmental conditions, cost, and mandate re-
quirements. It is a recommended practice to test the tags on the objects to be
tagged. Tag selection involves compromise among conflicting criteria.
The substrate and the adhesive on the tag affect the quality and perfor-
mance of the tag. The substrate may absorb moisture or chemicals and re-
duce read performance of the tag or may corrode the tag antenna. The
substrate may dry up and crack. The adhesive must be selected so it holds
the tag to the object under different environmental conditions.It must also
be compatible with the tag use—for example,the adhesive of the tag placed
on food items should not be toxic.

REVIEW ANSWERS
1.
The integrated circuit (IC) has memory to store data. The object
ID is stored in this memory.
2.
A LF tag antenna couples with the interrogator antenna using
magnetic flux.
3.
A 75 micron thick PET sheet can be used for tag substrate. The
ceramic sheet will be too fragile to use.
4.
Cases of items are usually tagged with smart labels.
5.
Semi-passive tags do not have a transmitter.
6.
Passive and semi-passive tags use backscatter to communicate
with the interrogator.
7.
LF and HF ranges use inductive coupling.
8.
HF is the best frequency range to use for objects with aqueous
substances and at a distance of approximately 2 feet. The LF could read
100
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

objects with aqueous substances but will not provide a read range
of 2 feet.
9.
The Gen 2 specification covers the frequency range 860–960 MHz.
10.
Semi-passive UHF tags provide a read range of up to 100 feet.
11.
Active tags belong to EPC Class 4.
12.
The interrogator will read only two tags because it is designed
for use with the Gen 2 protocol. Only two tags use the ISO 18000-6C
protocol, another name for Gen 2. A tag and interrogator must use the
same protocol to communicate.
13.
When the antenna plane and tag plane are parallel to each other,
the tag is in the best orientation for reading as well as for writing. It
collects the maximum power.
14.
The tags that were near the borderline of the IZ cannot be read
because the circularly polarized antenna transmits only half the power
of a linearly polarized antenna. This will reduce the size of IZ to about
70 percent and the tags that fall beyond this cannot be read.
15.
Dwell time is defined as the time the tag stays inside the IZ.

An interrogation zone (IZ,shown in Figure 4-1) consists of the interrogator,an-
tennas, cables, peripherals, and the environment in which the equipment is in-
stalled. The complexity of an IZ is determined by its environment, in which the
presence of multiple objects can cause reflections, absorption, or interference
with the original signal. These factors can cause unintentional reads, can block
the intended reads, and can reduce throughput processing capability.
Hardware and software for an IZ must be properly selected and configured to
eliminate or overcome the environmental and business procedural obstacles
and limitations. Before you can create a properly functioning IZ, you must un-
derstand its components. This chapter starts by explaining the interrogator
functionality and its components, and then it reviews various types of interro-
gators. Next, interrogator antennas, types, polarization, and function are dis-
cussed. The next part of the chapter is dedicated to interrogator operation,
including air interface and data protocols, dense interrogator mode, anti-colli-

sion, and other tag management practices. The last part of the chapter discusses
IZ configuration as well as interference problems that could arise when optimiz-
ing a system.
Objective 4.1
Interrogator
Functionality
I
nterrogators read and write data to and from tags. Interrogators are re-
sponsible for remotely powering the tags (in passive and semi-passive sys-
tems), establishing the bidirectional data flow between themselves and the
tags, and performing analog to digital as well as digital to analog signal con-
version.
Local Lingo
Transceiver
Interrogators are commonly referred to as readers or
sometimes transceivers.
Interrogators can also run attached to peripheral devices, such as light stacks
or alerting horns that provide feedback on conditions within the system and
triggering devices, which control when the interrogators are turned on and off.
Peripherals are usually attached to the I/O ports of the interrogators.
Interrogators can also communicate with and control nearby sensors inte-
grated within the IZ and are responsible for communications over networks for
alerting back-end systems of the assets or goods they are tracking.
According to their capabilities, interrogators are often called either smart or
dumb. Smart interrogators carry built-in computers that run programs, which
filter, aggregate, and analyze data to turn it into meaningful events for the
back-end system. A dumb interrogator reads tag data and reports what it sees to
the back-end system. This type of interrogator is highly dependent on a
middleware product that performs filtering and aggregation functions and con-
verts the data read into a meaningful format, which acts as the input to the
back-end system.
Interrogators often have a graphical user interface (GUI) by which they
can be controlled. An interrogator GUI is typically accessible through a web
interface using any commercial Internet browser on the computer or

106
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
through a simple application program. Following are some typical features of
a GUI:
•
Read from and write to tag capability
•
Network configuration settings
•
Antenna settings
•
Power settings
•
Input/Output port configuration settings
•
Firmware upgrade capability
Firmware upgrades on the interrogator are performed to enhance perfor-
mance, support new features, or resolve issues with the existing platform. They
are usually downloaded from the manufacturer’s Web site and can be deployed
to the interrogators in a variety of methods. Most common methods are a Pull
method, where the new firmware is downloaded or “pulled”by the reader using
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and an
automated Push method, where the new firmware is automatically uploaded or
“pushed”to a reader from the host. The method used depends on the manufac-
turer and middleware used in the installation.
Interrogator Components
An interrogator includes a transmitter,a receiver,and a processor.The transmit-
ter part of an interrogator consists of the following:
•
Base band transmitter
Sends the carrier wave that powers the tags
•
Oscillator
Produces the alternating current that makes up the waves
transmitted to the tag
•
Power amplifier
Amplifies the signals produced by the oscillator
•
Modulator
The original RF wave’s amplitude, frequency of
transmission, or phase
The receiver part of an interrogator consists of the following:
•
Amplifier
Amplifies the weak signals received from the tag before
demodulation
•
Demodulator
Compares the modulated signal to the original signal,
thereby extracting the information embedded within

A processor embedded within the interrogator provides these functions:
•
Controls network communications with the middleware or back-end
system
•
Runs the primary operation systems for the interrogator
•
Controls the functions of the interrogator
•
Controls the memory (ROM, RAM, hard drive type data storage)
Today, many of these components are contained within a digital signal pro-
cessor so that the radio portion of the interrogator is essentially software-con-
trolled and features can be changed or upgraded on the fly.
The external interfaces to the interrogator are various communication ports
such as RS-232, RS-245, or RS-422 serial ports; universal serial bus (USB);
Bluetooth and 802.11 wireless network interfaces; LAN ports; general-purpose
I/O ports; and most importantly antenna ports typically found in batches of
four or eight antennas, depending on whether the interrogator is monostatic or
bistatic (discussed shortly).
Interrogators can be powered in different ways. For installations of almost
any commercially available interrogator, you will need readily accessible 110 V
or 240 V AC outlets (for US and European installations,respectively).Handheld
interrogators can utilize an internal battery, but they will have to be recharged
using a docking station connected to an AC outlet. In certain situations, it may
be appropriate to use Power Over Ethernet (POE), which allows the same wire
that transfers data to the interrogator to provide power to it also.
Travel Assistance
For more information selecting frequencies, tags, interrogators,
antennas, cables, peripherals, and software, see Chapter 6.
Monostatic vs. Bistatic Interrogator
A monostatic interrogator uses a single antenna to transmit and/or receive data
to or from a tag. A circulator that lives inside the interrogator turns the antenna
from the transmitting to receiving function in a very rapid manner.A bistatic in-
terrogator uses two antennas,each dedicated either to transmitting or receiving.
Bistatic interrogators usually have twice as many antenna ports as monostatic
interrogators.

Interrogator Types
I
nterrogators come in multiple formats, and you choose the most appropriate
type to match the business process in which you are trying to use this technol-
ogy. Fixed interrogators are designed to be bolted to walls near doorways or at-
tached to wire racks near doors, integrated into stands and dock door portals,
and attached to conveyor portals and the like. Mobile interrogators are handheld
or mounted to vehicles.
Mobile interrogators, such as handheld interrogators, are often used for
low-volume reading or writing in exception processing, quality assurance, and
mobile shipping receiving units. Handheld interrogators come in a variety of
forms and have a vast selection of options for communications. They can be
tethered, receiving power and accomplishing data transmission via a nearby
base unit using an extensible cord.Other types of handhelds can be wireless,de-
pending on wireless networks or Bluetooth communications for data transfer,
limiting operational time to battery life between charges. Newer renditions of
handheld interrogators are appearing in forms of cellular phones and personal
digital assistants (PDAs).
Handheld interrogators are usually monostatic,with integrated linear anten-
nas. The monostatic design keeps their size to a minimum since only one an-

tenna is used, while the linear antenna polarization is used to get the best read
range. The interrogator’s orientation can be changed simply by turning your
wrist.
Vehicle-mounted interrogators, which can automate shipping and receiving
of goods, are usually integrated into material handling devices such as forklifts,
paper trucks, cargo trucks, and pallet jacks. These interrogators usually have a
special shape for easier installation onto the vehicle and a rugged design to sur-
vive the vibrations and other environmental conditions.

Interrogators can also come in the form of a PCMCIA card for laptops,
which is capable of being installed into any standard laptop port; or mod-
ule-based interrogators found in RFID-enabled printers.
Travel Advisory
Not all laptops include a standard PCMCIA port. Some feature
instead the newer ExpressCard.
Objective 4.3
Interrogator Antennas
T
he interrogator antenna is a converter between the radiated waves and
wired voltage that feeds the system. It is the largest and most obvious and
most exposed point of the system, as it must be near the assets it is identifying.
This also makes it the most vulnerable point of the system, because it can be
physically impacted by goods traversing the IZ. Antennas tend to be near door-
ways in distribution centers and manufacturing centers so they are occasionally
exposed to rain, snow, wind, and high-speed vehicles (such as fork trucks) trav-
eling through the IZ.

CHAPTER 4 Interrogation Zone
111
Antenna Footprint
The footprint of the antenna will dictate the size of the IZ and how well the zone
will be covered by the antenna. Most antennas come with a radiation plot that
defines the area the antenna will cover,how far away the signal can be measured,
and how wide the antenna beam is at its widest. Overlapping antenna coverage
is always a good idea in fixed interrogator installations to ensure consistent and
maximum coverage within the IZ.
Antenna Polarization
Both linearly and circularly polarized antennas are used in common RFID sup-
ply chain applications. Linear antennas propagate only on a single plane, so they
are either horizontally or vertically polarized. Linear antennas have a more fo-
cused beam than a circular antenna, and as a result, more power is realized on a
single plane in the IZ compared to circular antennas. Therefore, linear antennas
achieve longer read ranges and better penetration of dense objects than circular
antennas.
Circularly polarized antennas spread their power equally across a vertical and
a horizontal plane; therefore, the signal is not propagated as far and a tag does
not receive as much power as it would from a linear antenna, because the power
is split across two planes. The main advantage of a circular antenna is, however,
that the objects do not need to be in a specific orientation in order to be read.

112
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
In a mixed environment where orientation cannot be controlled,circular an-
tennas work best.In a manufacturing environment where orientation can be as-
sured, linear antennas are better because they can penetrate dense objects.
Travel Advisory
Antennas are neither monostatic nor bistatic, as this is determined by the
interrogator. However, they are sometimes referred to in these ways because
an antenna that is intended for use in a bistatic interrogator usually consists
of two antennas in its casing and is larger in size. Theoretically, this
antenna could be used as two monostatic antennas if it were
connected to two antenna ports on a monostatic interrogator.
Objective 4.4
Interrogator Operation
I
nterrogators receive commands from the back-end system to perform vari-
ous functions, such as reporting what they see either in real time or at fixed
intervals throughout the read cycle. Commands to start reading or writing tags
at a particular time can also come from triggering devices in the IZ. As men-
tioned,interrogators transmit power and data to the tags,receive the signal back
from the tags,decode the signal,and hand that signal off in digital format for the
back-end system. Although this may sound relatively simple, many functions
are involved in this process, such as air interface protocols, multi-interrogator
environment modes, and anti-collision functions.
Protocols
An air interface protocol is the means by which the tag communicates with the
interrogator and the interrogator communicates with the tag. Data protocols
determine how the interrogator interprets the numbers it reads during this ex-
change. Air interface protocols and data protocols are governed by various
standard bodies such as the International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) and EPCglobal, the two primary bodies that define how these protocols
work.

CHAPTER 4 Interrogation Zone
113
Proprietary air interface protocols also exist; these are specific to certain in-
dustries such as the Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG), Canadian
Cattle Industry Association (CCIA), and a number of other industry-specific
organizations that define standards proprietary to these organizations. These
protocols usually do not support interoperability,but they are often available a
lot sooner than the standards from the main organizations because of faster
execution and relative simplicity.
Air Interface Protocols
Air interface protocols define the frequency at which the interrogator operates
(keep in mind that the tag frequency must match the interrogator’s frequency),
the maximum power allowed for transmission by the interrogator, the modula-
tion and demodulation schemes used by the interrogator to communicate with
the tags,and the data rate of which the communication is capable.The air inter-
face protocol also governs the interrogator-to-tag communications—such as
commands for controlling a tag population, reading a tag, writing to a tag, or
killing a tag—as well as tag-to-interrogator communication, such as responses
from tags in the event of filtered read (that is, case tags responding to a call for
only case tags) or in the event of a collision.
Interrogators that are expected to operate globally usually support a large
number of air interfaces and data interfaces.Support for ISO,EPCglobal,AIAG,
IntelliTag, and many other interfaces are used in such interrogators. Multi-pro-
tocol support is challenging, because the more protocols an interrogator scans
for, the slower it reads. In high-speed applications, this can create issues that
could be avoided simply by standardizing practice on a single protocol.
Data Protocols
Tag data protocols or data formats govern the tag memory and its layout, pro-
vide standards for data translation, and generally govern the meaning of the
data as opposed to the way it is communicated, which is taken care of by the air
interface protocols.
Dense Interrogator Mode
Dense interrogator mode (often called dense reader mode) allows for operation of
multiple interrogators located within close proximity of each other without
causing interrogator interference. Dense interrogator mode can also involve

special allocations in which interrogators and tags are separated in their ability
to communicate on various channels so that strong interrogator signals will not
overpower weaker tag responses.
Interrogators that are EPC Gen 2 certified use dense interrogator mode when
the number of interrogators present in an environment exceeds the number of
available channels. In North America, dense interrogator mode is used if more
than 50 interrogators are installed within a facility. In Europe, the mode is used
if the number of operating interrogators is greater than 10 if they operate at
maximum allowed power.
Dense interrogator mode allows for coordination of interrogators so that no
two interrogators are transmitting at the exact same moment on exactly the
same frequency and causing interference within one another’s IZs. To do this,
many interrogators perform frequency hopping and support a function known
as listen before talk (LBT).
Frequency hopping employs a technology that forces an interrogator to
change channels constantly within a given range of frequencies. For instance, a
UHF interrogator licensed by the FCC for operation in North America must
support hopping across 50 channels (each 500 kHz wide) between the frequen-
cies of 902 to 928 MHz and spend no longer than 0.04 second in any channel
during this rotation.
To perform LBT, interrogators use an antenna (often a dedicated antenna) to
listen for the frequency on which the interrogator is about to transmit. If an-
other interrogator is communicating in that channel,the interrogator will auto-
matically switch to the next available channel and transmit there instead. LBT is
often used with frequency hopping and is required in Europe for dense interro-
gator operations.
Other forms of dense interrogator mode include spectral allocation, time
slice interrogator control, software synchronization, and hardware timing con-
trols of interrogator platforms.
Spectral allocation designates a portion of the allotted frequency range for
each type of communication. This allows tags to talk in different channels than
interrogators, which prevents them from interfering with one another.
Exam Tip
Know that spectral allocation is the preferred method used by
Generation 2 systems.

MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

CHAPTER 4 Interrogation Zone
115
Time slice interrogator control is typically done with a back-end system con-
troller that determines when each interrogator is allowed to communicate. In
this method, each interrogator is provided a set period of time for communica-
tion, and it is then turned off to wait for its next turn while all the other interro-
gators communicate.
Software synchronization allows the interrogators to communicate with one
another and determine which one can transmit at what time via software built
into the interrogator’s operating system.
Hardware timing will usually employ the use of triggering devices to allow
interrogators to communicate for controlled periods of time. For instance,
when an object breaks a light beam on the way into the IZ, the read cycle is
started. As the object leaves the IZ, it breaks another beam that tells the inter-
rogator to stop.
Tag Population Management
Interrogators support various commands and functions used for managing the
tag population. They can address an entire group of tags to perform inventory
of all tags in the area, as well as singulate each tag to access its memory and per-
form reading and writing operations.
The following are the most important interrogator commands:
•
Select
Used to determine which groups of tags will respond to
further interrogation using the Inventory command (for example,
this command can be used to isolate case tags from item tags). This
command does not require any response from tags.
•
Inventory
Used to identify individual tags within a group.
•
Access
Used to communicate with individual tags and issue
commands to them once they have been singulated.
•
Kill
After the tag has been accessed and a secure communication
channel established, this command can be used to make the tag stop
functioning. Killed tags will not respond to interrogation and cannot
be resurrected.
•
Lock
Used to secure the contents of a tag. Once issued, it can prevent
the tag from being read from or written to. Can also be used to lock
individual tag memory banks.

116
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Gen 2 interrogators support these interrogator commands and also tag man-
agement functions, such as AB symmetry and sessions.
AB symmetry replaced the Gen 1 technique of “putting tags to sleep”after be-
ing interrogated. AB symmetry allows tags to be flagged with an identifier to
ease counting. If a tag that was flagged as an A gets counted, it then becomes
flagged with a B until another round of inventory, when it returns to its default
position A.This technique eliminates problems with tags that cannot “wake up”
or are slow to wake up for the next round of inventory.
Gen 2 tags support four sessions. This function is used when more interroga-
tors or groups of interrogators interrogate the same group of tags. A tag would
use each session to communicate with one interrogator or group of interroga-
tors.This way,if a tag communicates with one interrogator and has been flagged
with a B, for instance, a second interrogator communicating with the tag will
use a second session with its own A and B flags. This will prevent the interroga-
tors from interfering with each other’s inventory rounds and avoid confusion
that may cause an interrogator to count a tag twice.
Anti-collision
The various types of anti-collision methods can be reduced to two basic types:
deterministic and probabilistic. An example of deterministic is binary tree algo-
rithm or tree walking algorithm. An example of probabilistic is the ALOHA
anti-collision algorithm.
The deterministic algorithm works by asking for bits on the tag ID, and
only tags with matching IDs respond. It starts by asking for the first numbers
of the tag until it gets matches for tags; then it continues to ask for additional
characters until all tags within the region are found. This method is slow
but ultimately leads to fewer collisions and a more accurate search for tags in
the IZ.
In a probabilistic method, tags respond at randomly generated times. If a
collision occurs, colliding tags will have to identify themselves again after
waiting a random period of time based on a random number the tag selects.
This process will eventually isolate and identify all the tags in the IZ but is
prone to collisions since it is possible that tags could choose times too close to
one another.

Interrogation Zone
Configuration
T
o make an interrogator function properly, you must configure it properly
using settings that differ by the type of the interrogator as well as the man-
ufacturer. Following are the most common settings you may encounter.
•
Output power
One of the most important settings is the transmit
power level of an interrogator. The power level is usually set so that
interrogators do not interfere with IZs installed parallel to one another.
Power levels will be usually provided in watts (W), milliwatts (mW),
decibels (dB) or as a percentage, where 100 percent will equal to 1 W
(or the maximum allowed power for that region of the world). In
certain situations, you may be able to adjust both the reading power
and writing power.
•
Antenna settings
You can combine antennas into groups within the
configuration of an interrogator. This allows multiple antennas to act
as a single device, pushing more power into the IZ to flood the area
with a signal and ensure that all tags in that area are read. In many
cases, you can also choose antenna sequencing, which allows multiple
antennas to operate in a particular order.
•
Retries
You can set up the number of times an interrogator will
attempt to find new tags in the IZ before reporting its findings. This
is known as retries.
•
Filtering
This feature allows the interrogator to communicate only
with the portion of the tag population it is looking for. For instance, a
dock door interrogator may filter out all case tags and communicate
results from pallet tags only.
•
Polling
Interrogators can scan for tags either continuously, in preset
intervals, or on demand.
•
Modes of reading
Sometimes you can choose from various modes
of reading that are already preset to ensure a specific interrogator
performance. You can encounter a conveyor mode, self-mode, or rapid

118
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
read mode, and although manufacturers use different terms to refer to
these modes, they all are basically the same for all interrogators. When
in conveyor mode, the interrogator reads in fast intervals with a low
number of retries; in this mode, usually few tags are in the IZ but they
need to be read quickly, since the tag is in view of the antenna for only
a short time. Inventory mode is more of a transitional mode. The
interrogator will report when it sees a change; it will see a large number
or a given number of tags for a specific amount of time, and when that
number changes, the interrogator instantly generates a report to the
back-end system to indicate the loss or gain of a new tag identity.
Handling Interference
Interference is mitigated by the environment and the modes in which the inter-
rogators operate. Single interrogator environments obviously indicate one inter-
rogator is installed in a particular facility. This interrogator can broadcast on
whatever channels it finds appropriate within its configuration at any given
time.The interrogator will not encounter interference from other interrogators,
but it may encounter interference from the environment and from its own
multipath interference caused by reflections of its own or other signal(s). This
type of interference can be handled by proper shielding and by adjusting the sig-
nal strength and antenna gain.
If the number of simultaneously operating interrogators is smaller than the
number of available channels,a multiple interrogator environment results.In this
type of environment, the interrogators can interfere with each other, but you
can resolve this by assigning specific channels to specific interrogators or by
time division.
In a dense interrogator environment, the number of interrogators operating is
greater than the number of available channels. As discussed earlier, certified in-
terrogators will incorporate schemes identified in the Gen 2 specification to
minimize mutual interference.
Exam Tip
Know that to handle a dense interrogator environment successfully, it
is essential that all interrogators operate in dense interrogator mode.
If one interrogator does not operate in this mode, the whole scheme
will not work.

CHAPTER 4 Interrogation Zone
119
System Optimization
You must consider the speed and direction of the tagged assets/goods moving
through the IZ when you are installing and configuring the IZ. Direction can be
determined by using multiple input sensors, such as light break sensors, at the
beginning and the end of the IZ. The order in which the sensors are triggered
will indicate which direction the goods are traveling through the IZ. Some an-
tennas in development can sense the direction of tag movement. These are es-
sentially active antenna arrays, which will sweep a coverage area using multiple
antennas embedded within one another in a certain sequence. These antennas,
coupled with the appropriate interrogator, can not only indicate direction of
travel, but also eliminate weak areas in the coverage of the primary lobe.
Local Lingo
Dwell time
The time in which tags are within range of an antenna’s
beam.
The speed of the items traveling through the IZ will ultimately determine
how many tags can be successfully read during their dwell time. If an interroga-
tor has a maximum read ability of 500 tags per second, for example, and due to
the coverage of the antennas and the speed of the goods, tags are in the interro-
gation field for only two thirds of a second, your interrogator will read only 330
tags—two thirds of the total tag population.These values come from the combi-
nation of the constraint of the abilities of the interrogator and the speed the tags
travel through the zone. If you want to extend the dwell time as much as possi-
ble,you should angle the antennas 25 to 45 degrees into or away from the path of
travel. This will make the beam wider along the path of travel for the goods,
thereby increasing the time the tags spend in the read field.
Travel Assistance
For more information on antenna positioning, see Chapter 7.
Angling the antennas will also help with handling the reflections in the IZ
caused, for instance, by metallic objects.

Travel Advisory
If you know that you will be reading tags placed on metallic items or materials,
you should install multiple antennas, each slightly angled, so that
at least one antenna captures the backscattered signal from the
tag without interference from reflected waves.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 4.1: Interrogator Functionality
Interrogators read and write
data to and from tags. Interrogators are responsible for remotely powering
the tags (in passive and semi-passive systems), establishing the bidirectional
data flow between the tags and themselves, and converting analog to digital
as well as digital to analog signals.
Interrogators can also run attached peripheral devices such as light
stacks or alerting horns, which provide feedback on conditions within the
system, and triggering devices, which control when the interrogators are
turned on and off. Peripherals are usually attached to the I/O ports of the
interrogators.
Most interrogators, depending on their type, include some of the follow-
ing communication ports: RS-232, RS-245, or RS-422 serial ports; USB;
Bluetooth and 802.11 wireless network interfaces; LAN ports; and general-
purpose I/O ports (GPIOs).
Firmware upgrades on interrogators are performed to enhance perfor-
mance,support new features,or resolve bugs in the existing platform.They
can be downloaded from the manufacturer’s site and deployed to the inter-
rogators in a variety of methods, ranging from FTP, HTTP, or auto-
mated push, depending on the manufacturer and middleware used in the
installation.
The interrogator’s GUI is typically accessible through a web interface us-
ing any commercial Internet browser or through a simple application pro-
gram. Typical features of a GUI include the ability to read and write tags;
make network configuration settings, antenna settings, and power settings;
configure an I/O port; and upgrade the firmware.

✔Objective 4.2: Interrogator Types
Interrogators are available as fixed or
mobile devices that can be handhelds or vehicle mounted.
Handheld interrogators are often used for low-volume reading or writing
in exception processing, quality assurance, or mobile shipping-receiving
units. Handheld interrogators can be tethered, receiving power and accom-
plishing data transmission via a nearby base unit using an extensible cord.
Other types of handhelds can be wireless that depend on wireless networks
or Bluetooth communications for data transfer, limiting operational time to
battery life between charges.Newer renditions of handheld interrogators are
incorporated in cellular phones and PDAs.
Vehicle-mounted interrogators are usually integrated into material-han-
dling devices such as forklifts, paper trucks, cargo trucks, and pallet jacks.
These interrogators usually have a special shape for easier installation on the
vehicle and a rugged design to survive vibrations and other environmental
conditions.
✔Objective 4.3: Interrogator Antennas
Antennas can be linearly or circu-
larly polarized. Linearly polarized antennas propagate only on one plane,
while circular antennas propagate on all planes.Circular antennas are less ef-
ficient because they have to divide the signal between multiple planes, while
linear antennas can focus on only one plane.
Antennas can be bistatic or monostatic, which is determined by an inter-
rogator. A monostatic interrogator uses a single antenna to transmit and re-
ceive and requires a circulator, which lives inside the interrogator and turns
the antenna from transmitting to receiving function in a rapid manner. A
bistatic interrogator uses two antennas, each dedicated either for transmit-
ting or receiving. Bistatic interrogators usually have twice as many antenna
ports as monostatic interrogators.
✔Objective 4.4: Interrogator Operation
Dense interrogator mode allows
for operation of multiple interrogators within a close vicinity of each other
without causing interrogator interference. Dense interrogator mode has
several variations, such as spectral allocation, time slice interrogator con-
trol, software synchronization, and hardware timing. When installing
multiple interrogators, you can help prevent interference by shielding
them and making sure that the antenna footprints from adjacent zones do
not overlap.

122
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Interrogators that are EPCglobal Gen 2 certified use dense interrogator
mode when the number of interrogators present in an environment ex-
ceeds the number of available channels. In North America, dense interro-
gator mode is used if more than 50 interrogators are installed within a
facility. In Europe, the number of operating interrogators must be larger
than 10 if they operate at maximum allowed power. In a dense interrogator
mode,many interrogators perform frequency hopping and support the lis-
ten before talk (LBT) algorithm.
In the United States, a UHF interrogator licensed by the FCC for opera-
tion in North America must support hopping across 50 channels (each 500
kHz wide) within the frequencies of 902 to 928 MHz and spend no longer
than 0.04 second in any channel during this rotation. LBT is a requirement
of operation in Europe in the band of 865 to 868 MHz. Operation at 869.4
to 869.65 MHz requires duty cycling.
Two major types of anti-collision protocols are used: deterministic and
probabilistic. The deterministic algorithm works by asking for bits on the
tag ID, and only tags with matching IDs respond. This method is slow but
ultimately will lead to fewer collisions and a more accurate search for tags
in the IZ. In a probabilistic method, tags respond at randomly generated
times. If a collision occurs, both tags will have to identify themselves again
after waiting another random time interval. This process will eventually
isolate and identify all the tags in the IZ but is prone to collisions. The Q al-
gorithm is used during anti-collision by Gen 2 tags.
Interrogators perform tag population management using commands
such as Select, Inventory, and Access (including Read, Write, Lock, and
Kill).
✔Objective 4.5: Interrogation Zone Configuration
Several settings must be
configured in an IZ: output power, antenna settings, retries, filtering, poll-
ing,and modes of reading such as a conveyor mode,self-mode,or rapid read
mode. These modes are preset configurations for specific types of applica-
tions.
To achieve the highest read rates, the interrogator should be set only for
one air interface protocol.Use dense interrogator mode only if necessary be-
cause it slows down interrogator performance; however, dense interrogator
mode will ensure that the tags are read successfully.
The system should be set to interrogate only when needed using trigger-
ing devices such as sensors. The transmitted power must be set according to

the desired radiation pattern and read distance to achieve successful reads
and reduce interference.Using antennas with higher gain will achieve longer
read ranges but a narrower read field, while antennas with lower gain will
achieve shorter read ranges and a wider read field. Angling the antennas 20
to 45 degrees toward the direction of tag travel or following the direction of
travel helps increase dwell time and therefore reads and may help with
avoiding interference. Angling the antennas will also help with handling the
reflections in the IZ caused, for instance, by metallic objects.

Every RFID implementation needs peripheral devices such as RFID-enabled
printers, RFID-enabled automated label applicators (also known as print and
apply devices), as well as feedback components such as light stacks, horns, LED
lights or LCD displays, and triggering devices such as light break sensors. These
devices enhance the capabilities of an RFID system, control I/O devices, control
system timing functions, and provide on/off capabilities for various business
applications.Peripherals also improve human interactions with RFID hardware
by assisting automatic data collection and increasing the safety of the system.

of RFID Printers
R
FID printers in an automated RFID system often utilize existing print
points within a manufacturing or distribution supply chain. Because many
of the current Auto-ID systems use barcoding, the conversion to RFID systems
will be an incremental change. The first step in enabling your current barcode
printing and application points with RFID will be to obtain RFID-enabled label
printers.
RFID-enabled label printers represent a tagging method that can accommo-
date both types of Auto-ID systems,RFID and barcode,in a single unit.The sys-
tem uses a regular barcode label with an RFID inlay embedded in the back of the
label. This is called a smart label and will typically have human-readable infor-
mation printed on the front of the label. The addition of the RFID tag enables
non–line-of-sight identification, which allows for many automated functions
and/or serialized inventory.
Using a smart label printer is the easiest way to handle RFID integration, be-
cause it is easily incorporated with the existing business process,data structures,
and networks associated with it. The smart label printer replaces the existing
printer, keeping the label application process identical. The same print server
and network connections used for the old printer can be used with the new one.
The labels can be printed and applied immediately prior to shipment to
downstream clients. This application, typically called slap and ship, is one of the
fastest and easiest ways to comply with any customer mandates. However, slap
and ship does not provide any of the benefits of RFID for the user, with the ex-
ception of verification of shipping (Figure 5-1 shows an interrogation portal

used for verification).This is sufficient for a company shipping limited amounts
of stock keeping units (SKUs). However, when companies reach a point at
which costs of the manual labor used to apply labels onto products prior to
shipping outweigh the costs and benefits of tagging all of their products during
manufacturing process in an automated manner, slap and ship systems will be-
come obsolete. If you plan properly, you can reuse much of this equipment in
the larger, full-scale implementation.
Label Selection
To use an RFID-enabled label printer, you must first perform a case analysis to
determine what tags are correct for use with your application. The case analysis
will include a detailed assessment of the contents of the package and its effect on
RF, the package material and its effect on RF, the package surface characteristics
for selection of the proper adhesive,the packaging design,and the method of at-
tachment to be used for tagging the cases and products. Figure 5-2 shows a
smart label,which is the most common type of media for passive-RFID tagging.
FIGURE 5.1
Interrogation portal

The label should be large enough to display all of the existing printed infor-
mation as well as any additional information required for the RFID tag embed-
ded in the back of the label, such as the Electronic Product Code (EPC) logo to
indicate the use of an EPC tag within the label.
The size should also be appropriate for the boxes to which the labels are ap-
plied. You must also consider the compatibility of the label adhesive with the
boxes, the method of attachment, the environment in which the tagged assets
will be moving, as well as the requirements of the label applicator. The RFID tag
embedded in the label should meet pre-existing RFID customer requirements.
Some of these requirements can include the standard that the customer uses for
reading within the facility, the frequency of operation for the tag, as well as the
amount of memory on the tag, read/write capabilities, and the tag’s ability to
contain the data required.
The RFID tag embedded in the label should be appropriate for the items in-
side the box. Special tags may be needed to tag difficult-to-read materials such
as water, metal, and most aqueous liquids, as well as packaging or product with
high carbon or salt contents.All of these materials can affect the RF signals com-
ing from the interrogator as they attempt to energize the tag.
130

FIGURE 5.2
A smart label

You must also consider the compatibility of labels with your label applicator,
including the dimensions of the label and whether or not they fall within the ac-
ceptable parameters for the printer. Two main types of label media formats are
used: media roll or fan-fold.
Travel Advisory
Quality is of prime importance when selecting label stock. This media has to
deliver consistent and reliable results. If quality varies dramatically from one
roll of media to the next—or, even worse, from one tag to the next—it
will make the entire system inefficient. Sufficient time and
attention to detail in selecting the proper media is critical to the
overall success of any RFID implementation.
The label surface must be appropriate for the method of printing used with
the particular printer. Two types of print methods are used for both industrial
barcode printers and RFID printers: thermal transfer,which uses heat to transfer
ink from a separate ribbon to the label, and direct thermal, which uses special
media in the form of a treated label stock that turns black when heated.Pros and
cons exist for both of these methods.For long-term application where the labels
will have a lengthy lifecycle in the supply chain, thermal transfer printers should
be used as the labels do not fade with exposure to sun or heat.These printers will
typically print with a higher DPI (dot per inch), or resolution, on the label. The
advantages of a direct thermal printer are a simpler design and therefore easier
loading of the media, no ribbon, and easier maintenance for the printer due to
fewer components that could break. However, the labels tend to be more expen-
sive and fade quicker when exposed to heat.
CHAPTER 5 RFID Peripherals
131

Exam Tip
Be aware that for labels that will be subjected to heat, a thermal
transfer printer should be used.
When choosing a tag and a printer, you must use the same protocol and fre-
quency as well as proper inlay alignment in a label. The RFID tag must be posi-
tioned so it aligns correctly with the encoder antenna so that it can be read or
written to.This positioning changes from one printer to the next,as many print-
ers have their antennas placed at different locations within the print pad. Each
label will be specific to a particular type of printer for which it is designed and
the inlay position in the label should match the specifications provided by the
printer manufacturer. If the inlay position does not match the required specifi-
cations,you will not be able to use a default mode and you will need to run a cal-
ibration process to make sure the printer determines the inlay’s position. You
can see various tag alignments in the smart label in Figure 5-3.
When a tag inside a label fails to operate within the specification of that tag,it
is called a quiet tag. Quiet tags can be a major concern for label makers as well as
users.Tag quality and performance need to be consistent.If it takes more energy
to light one tag than the others, this tag is not going to perform as well in your

133
interrogation zone (IZ). Performance of your tags must be reliable and must
have repeatable results that you can count on, in order to properly assess the in-
ventory moving throughout your facility.
Most RFID-enabled label printers have a way of verifying the function of the
tag in the label and assessing its readiness for use. These printers will determine
the response of the tag, and if the tag does not fall within the manufacturer’s
suggesting quality guidelines, the tag will be rejected and a special pattern will
be printed on the front of the label, indicating it should not be used. The printer
will then generate the next available label on the print line.
The tag within a smart label contains delicate electronic components and
must be handled just as you would handle computer components. Take care to
avoid subjecting tags to electrostatic discharge (ESD), crushing, dropping, and
exposing to moisture and extreme temperatures. You must consider all of these
aspects when choosing proper storage locations and handling procedures be-
fore you purchase and use a smart label.
Travel Advisory
Most RFID-enabled printers have validation and error recovery built in, and
the command structure to control the printer is similar to existing
barcode printers, with the addition of RFID control commands to
enable the encoding and verification of smart labels.
Types of RFID Printers
Printers come in several varieties, including the following:
•
Plain label printers, which can use pre-encoded smart labels and print
information on them
•
Printer encoders that print information on the label and then
encode the tag with an EPC number or with another relevant
data representation for the product to which it is attached
•
Printer encoder and applicators, which print information on the label,
encoded with the identifying number, encode the RFID tag with the
proper identification, and then automatically apply the label to the box
The following photos show several types of RFID-enabled printers. Many of
these are designed in industrial-strength boxes typically made of metal for use

134
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
in heavy industrial environments where exposure to dust, temperature, high
humidity, and other extremes are likely.
Travel Advisory
As with any technology, the current landscape will change in six months. Protect
your investment as much as possible by buying print devices (this is valid for all
devices) that are firmware upgradeable, for both the printer and
the RFID unit embedded within it. Upgrading firmware to support
a new protocol is much less expensive than buying a completely
new printer.
Take care to follow the proper paper path for the media when loading a
printer, as this is imperative to the printer’s success when attempting to encode
smart labels. The print path is typically shown on the backboard of the printer
when you open the side cover, as shown in Figure 5-4. You must align the media
coming off the spool with the line painted on the backboard of the printer as
you feed it into the print head.
Tag Encoding
The printer must isolate the individual tag to which it is writing during the
print process. For this reason, RFID printers have integrated a very low power
reader with an antenna designed to read tags that are in close proximity. This
requires proper alignment of the RFID tag within the label and within the
print pad.

CHAPTER 5 RFID Peripherals
135
Exam Tip
Remember that writing to a tag requires more time and power than
reading from a tag, so this means that a writing application will be a
lot slower than simply reading the tag and applying it to the box.
Local Lingo
Writing to a tag
Also called tag encoding. The encoding or writing is
done by an RFID printer. Data can also be encoded or written to a tag by
RFID interrogators
The following sequence of events takes place to print and encode a label:
1. The printer receives a command and data from the host computer.
2. The label is positioned so that the reader can check for null data on the
tag. Null data is placed in a tag by the tag manufacturer to indicate that
FIGURE 5.4
Inside of an RFID printer

136
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
the tag has passed the manufacturer’s quality control. A quiet tag that
was pre-identified at the manufacturer will not have null data written;
therefore, this tag will be automatically rejected. The printer does not
attempt to program this tag and does not self-test the tag for any signal
strength but simply rejects it.
3. If the tag passes a validity check, the printer will write data to the tag
and then verify the data it has just written.
4. If the verification fails or the tag does not respond with the appropriate
signal strength, the tag is marked with a special void mark; it is then
rejected, and the process is repeated on the next label.
5. Once the tag is successfully encoded, the barcode and other
information is printed onto the label and an acknowledgement
is sent back to the host. This acknowledgement contains the serial
number that was just written to the RFID tag, as well as a successful
print signal.
6. The printed and encoded label is now presented to the user for
application to the package.
Printer Setup
Proper printer setup is extremely important for successful printing. The most
important setup parameters for RFID enabled barcode printers are these:
•
Label dimensions
Typical sizes for these are 4×1, 4×2, 4×4, and 4×6
inches.
•
The distance between two consecutive labels
This measurement
combined with the label length determines how far the printer will
advance to print/encode the next label.

CHAPTER 5 RFID Peripherals
137
•
The location of the inlay within the label
Some RFID enabled
printers offer the ability to move the antenna along the length of the
label. This is usually specified when the labels are ordered to ensure
compatibility with a specific manufacturer’s printer.
•
The inlay type
Some printers have settings that allow you to set the
specific manufacturer and model of the inlay being used in the printer.
•
The inlay protocol
If a generic tag size is chosen without specifying
the make and model of the inlay, a tag protocol will need to be defined.
This lets the encoder know what air and data protocol to use when
communicating with the tag.
•
The dimensions for various print zones
This setting is typically
found in the software driving the printer. When formatting the label
print area, this portion can be used to set up the printer to avoid
printing on the portion of the label containing the tag. This area can
cause artifacts on the printed label that can make portions of printed
information unreadable.
•
The feed rate for the printer
This is used to control how fast the
printer moves the labels through the print area.
Printer Installation
During printer installation, safety must be a prime consideration. Surge protec-
tion for the electrical supply and pressure relief for the pneumatic supply used
with print applicators are necessary precautions.
Follow these steps for printer installation:
1. Identify a proper location. When looking for the appropriate location
for a printer, ensure that it can be reached easily and is on a dry, level
surface. Operators need to have clear access to the front of the printer
to obtain printed labels. Additionally, adequate space should be
available to raise the cover of the printer for changing media and for
maintenance. The printer must be within cabling distance of power
and data connections. Finally, ensure that the location has adequate
environmental controls and ventilation to keep the printer within its
operational parameters as specified by the manufacturer.
2. Connect the printer to a consistent, grounded power source. The
printer should come with a grounded power cord, which you must

connect to a surge protected and reliable power source. If unstable
power conditions are common at the site, install an uninterruptible
power supply (UPS) in between the printer and the power outlet.
3. Connect the communications cabling and configure the device for the
network it is being connected to. There are many different types of
communications used by print devices. These include:
•
Ethernet
This communication method will commonly employ a
CAT5 cable to connect to the back-end network. The most critical
settings for this type of communication are IP address, subnet
mask, and default gateway.
•
Wireless Ethernet
Wireless networks require configuration of
all settings found in Ethernet networks, with the addition of the
appropriate wireless network credentials. These typically include
the service set identifier (SSID) and wired equivalent privacy
(WEP) key for security.
•
Serial networks
Serial ports vary from one type to the next,
but common types are RS-485, RS-422, and RS-232. Settings
will include baud rate, bits per second, parity, stop bits, and flow
control.
4. Load the media and run a test print. Refer to the printer manual
for instructions on how to run a test print, since this varies by
manufacturer. Most test labels will print a status page showing
information about the printer settings so you can verify all the
information you just configured. If everything has been configured
correctly and the test print is successful, you should be able to
generate a label using the back-end system.
Objective 5.2
Automatic Label
Applicators
A
utomatic label applicators are used for integration of RFID into an auto-
mated process. They can typically print on the face of the label and encode
the RFID tag that is embedded within it. Then this label is placed in a predeter-
mined location on objects as they pass. Speeds vary according to the technology
used and the application method employed.
138
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

There are two main types of RFID encoder printer applicators or automated
printing code and apply devices:
•
Pneumatic piston label applicators (Figure 5-5), also called tamp
or blow applicators, have a pneumatic tamp head that pushes labels
onto the object at a precise moment to ensure specific placement with
every label.
•
Wipe on label applicators (Figure 5-6) simply present the tag adhesive
side toward the package at the proper time in the manufacturing line
for the adhesive side to grab the side of the object to adhere the media
in the same spot on the side of the box every time.
CHAPTER 5 RFID Peripherals
139
FIGURE 5.5

140
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Setup and configuration of automatic label applicators involves the same in-
stallation procedures used for a smart label printer, with the addition of a few
extra steps:
•
Immediately after connecting the unit to power, connect it to an air
supply that meets the manufacturer’s specifications.
•
During the configuration portion of the installation, special
adjustments may need to be made to reflect the proper timing
of the application process, position and orientation of the label,
stroke of the pneumatic assembly, and pressure to be exerted on the
label. These settings are specific to the manufacturer, so be sure to
consult the manual while installing the unit.
Objective 5.3
Feedback Systems
F
eedback systems are used to alert operators to conditions that equipment
has been or is currently experiencing. The conditions indicated are config-

ured specifically to an application. Many common events that would cause an
alert are successful or unsuccessful tag read events, successful or unsuccessful
tag write events, improper flow of materials, or items being mishandled. Be-
cause a limitless number of events could cause an alert, the parameters that de-
fine when an alert occurs must be carefully planned and designed.
The most commonly used feedback devices are the following:
•
Lights
Lights can be used as part of a control panel, an overhead
lighting alert, or a light stack. They are used in places where visibility
is ensured and may be necessary due to high amounts of noise in the
area that could render an audible alert ineffective.
Normally, the lights are connected to a Programmable Logic
Controller (PLC) or a general-purpose I/O (GPIO) port of an
RFID interrogator. Events and conditions can trigger various lights
depending on the programming of the device. For instance, a green
light usually means a successful read, while a red light indicates error
conditions.
•
LCD displays
LCD displays can be simple LCD panels that are
capable of a limited amount of characters or LCD computer displays
that can display large amounts of variable data and graphics. These

142
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
are used when more information is required than is practical through
simple notification systems.
•
Horns
Horns are used for environments in which a bulb or screen
may be difficult to see for a variety of reasons: from being outdoors in
the sun to the fact that the location of the indicators is not within sight
of the operator during regular procedures. Horns and buzzers are
typically loud and obnoxious to ensure prompt reaction to facilitate
correction of an error condition.
•
Divert gates
During conveyance, exception triggers can cause
automatic diversion of objects to automated handling of these events.
•
Feedback through the software
Software components can monitor
sensors along your material handling process and notify when events
occur. The actions taken by the software could be simple database
logging, all the way to advanced automated exception handling.
•
Cell phone alerts
When specific conditions arise and have not been
addressed, an escalation path can be followed for notification. For
instance, local alerts are set, such as light stacks or horns, and if these
are not acted upon, the system can escalate to an e-mail alert. If there is

CHAPTER 5 RFID Peripherals
143
still no action, a Short Message Service (SMS) message can be sent to
one or many cell phones to be handled by appropriate personnel.
Travel Advisory
Make certain that if you enable the system to send an alert, a positive reaction
is required, such as a button press or a reintroduction of the product to the
IZ. This way, the system can record with certainty that the alert
was received and processed, and that actions were taken as
a result.
Objective 5.4
Triggering Devices
T
riggering devices are used to detect the presence of an object in an IZ.Every
well-designed RFID system should have triggering devices to ensure the
longevity of the equipment, the safety of the system, and the best possible envi-
ronment in which the system can operate. Without these sensors, interrogators
are left to poll constantly, which degrades the equipment over time, floods the
area surrounding the IZ with high levels of ambient electromagnetic noise, and
can potentially create safety issues due to lengthy exposure to RF for anyone
working in the immediate proximity of the IZ.
•
Light break sensor
Light break sensors are commonly employed
in manufacturing conveyor applications, though they can be
used in many other scenarios as well. They consist of two
components, an emitter and a receiver. The emitter creates and
sends a light beam across the travel path for the object you are trying
to detect. The receiver is placed directly across from the emitter, and
it recognizes the light beam. When the beam is broken, this indicates
that an object has entered the area. The receiver then sends a signal
to a controller that will initiate whatever action is required based on
the settings.

144
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
•
Proximity sensor
Proximity sensors typically use ultrasonic waves to
detect the presence of an object in the area. An object passing close to
the proximity sensor will reflect the ultrasonic waves back at the unit,
which can then derive the approximate distance based on the time for
the travel of the waves.

CHAPTER 5 RFID Peripherals
145
•
Other types
Other types of triggers can be employed, based on the
specific needs and inputs/outputs of a particular system. Software
algorithms that calculate the location of an object based on the speed
it is traveling and the last station it passed through, weight sensors to
detect an object that is directly on top of it, pressure sensors connected
to hydraulics of material handling devices to indicate an object is being
moved with it, and motion detectors similar to those used in home
security systems can all be used to trigger events within your system.
Objective 5.5
Real Time Location
Systems
R
eal time location systems (RTLSs) are employed to track high-value or mis-
sion-critical objects. As it applies to RFID, this type of system employs an
active tag that will assist a back-end system in calculating its position relative to
known points in the supply chain.
The functionality and methods used to determine the location of tagged
goods is similar to the way a GPS (global positioning system) works. However,
the known points being measured from are within a facility or campus, and the
range of the transponder attached to the tracked asset is usually measured in
meters, most with a range of 300 to 600 meters, rather than miles or kilometers.
RTLSs also do not employ a satellite and can be used inside buildings,while GPS
works only outside, where the GPS receiver has access to a satellite.
Several types of RTLS systems are in use:
•
Differential Time of Arrival (DTOA)
DTOA systems employ a tag
attached to an object that beacons on a given interval or is awaked
upon an event and then beacons. When the tag transmits, receivers
within range of the tag time stamp when they receive that particular
ID. This information is then passed to a location processor that
measures the difference between the receipt times of at least three
receivers, which allows the processor to “triangulate” the position of
the tag, as depicted in Figure 5-7. Currently, this is the most accurate
location technology available today.

146
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
•
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
RSSI systems are used
commonly in 802.11 wireless networks. An 802.11 wireless device
becomes the tag for this type of system. Based on signal strength, the
systems can determine to which receiver the transmitter is closest and
then provide an approximate location for it. The accuracy of this type
of system will be determined by the granularity with which the receivers
were installed. More accuracy is a direct reflection of installed cost. The
working principle of this type of system is showed in Figure 5-8.
•
Other types of systems:
•
Time-of-flight ranging systems
(Figure 5-9) These systems wake
up tags on a given frequency, and then measure how long it takes
the tag to respond on a different frequency, which gives the system
an approximate distance for the tag from the antenna.
•
Amplitude triangulation systems
(Figure 5-10) These systems
use the signal strength of tags received by multiple receivers to
determine an approximate location for the tag. The processor
FIGURE 5.7
RTLS based on DTOA

behind the receivers compares the signal strength from multiple
receivers, and determines that the tag is between three of them
based on receive strength.

Triangulation
Triangulation is based on a measurement of distance in time.
The speed at which a radio wave travels is absolute. Therefore, a triangulation
system compares how long it takes a signal to reach from the tag to each
of three receivers, and based on knowledge of relations of angles and
sides in a triangle, the location of this tag can be determined, or
“triangulated.”

automatic label applicators,with which the label after encoding and printing
is automatically applied to an object. All RFID printers include an RFID in-
terrogator inside to encode and verify the smart label.
The first step in printer installation is to identify a proper location for the
printer, which must be easily reached and located on a dry, level surface to
ensure access to the printer to obtain printed labels and to raise the cover of
the printer for changing media and perform maintenance. The printer must
be within cabling distance of power and data connections and have adequate
environmental controls and ventilation.
You must connect the printer to a consistent, grounded power source and
then to the communications cabling and configure the device for the net-
work to which it is being connected. Printers use Ethernet, Wireless Ether-
net, serial, and other types of communications. Lastly, you should load the
media and run a test print.When configuring the printer,you must set up la-
bel dimensions, the distance between two consecutive labels, the location of
the inlay within the label, the inlay type, the inlay protocol, dimensions for
various print zones, and the feed rate for the printer.
✔Objective 5.2: Automatic Label Applicators

following is the most reliable way to control scanning at the
dock doors?
A. Install switches at all dock doors to turn the interrogator on
and off.

you must do the following:
A. Disconnect the air supply.
B. Make sure that the label applicator is grounded.
C. Move the label applicator to the maintenance area.
D. Let the label applicator cool down.
REVIEW ANSWERS
1.
This question tries to confuse you. All RFID printers including
Gen 2 RFID printers contain an integrated RFID interrogator. The Gen
2 protocol refers to UHF, as you learned in previous chapters; therefore,
a UHF printer cannot use HF interrogator. RFID printers do not use
anti-collision because they communicate only with one tag at a time so
a collision (when two or more tags respond at the same time) cannot
occur. Finally, EPC Gen 2 tags may or may not require a printer,
depending on whether they are already programmed by a reader
or whether they need to have information printed on the label.
2.
RFID-based RTLS systems are typically used for locating items in
large areas such as yards, where you can install the network of RTLS
access points (readers).
3.
Automated encode, print, and apply label applicators can precisely
place labels on the cases. They cannot encode multiple labels at a time
or encode more than 250 tags per second. Some devices can encode

around 250 tags per minute. These devices can also use non-RFID
labels, where the labels will not be encoded but only printed and
applied.
4.
When the RFID printer prints half of the image across the
consecutive labels, the first thing you should check is the label size
setting.
5.
It is important to know where the RFID inlay is located within
a label because timing from the leading edge is critical to the encoding
process and printing over the chip could potentially cause damage to it.
6.
Direct thermal and thermal transfer methods are used by RFID
printers.
7.
Differential Time of Arrival (DTOA) is an algorithm used in real
time location systems (RTLS).
8.
When an RFID printer is printing the labels on the release liner
rather than the label itself, the label roll is improperly loaded in the
printer.
9.
In a distribution center, 20 dock doors have passive UHF RFID
portals. Most dock doors are used infrequently, so if you would like to
limit polling for tags only if tags are in the IZ, you should install light
break sensors to detect the presence of a forklift.

After the solution concept has been approved, design selection is performed, in-
cluding the consideration of hardware and software targeted for actual deploy-
ment. Design selection is a critical part of any RFID implementation, because
without the appropriate design,hardware,and software,the implemented RFID
system will not function properly. The steps of design selection and consider-
ations discussed in this chapter adhere to standards and regulations as well as
compliance with trading partner mandates, and selection of operating fre-
quency, tags, interrogators, antennas, peripherals, and software.
Objective 6.1
Standards, Mandates,
and Regulatory
Compliance
W
hen selecting hardware and software for your RFID system,you must fol-
low international, regional, and local standards and regulations. These
are often implemented to prevent device interference or to protect the general
public. Standards and regulations are discussed in detail in Chapter 10.
In addition, you must follow any trading partner–mandated specifications if
the system you are about to design is targeted to comply with a particular man-
date. A mandate will often define a particular tag data format and the frequency
of operation.
Travel Advisory
Mandates are not the only reasons why you should look at the system your
partners are using. If your operation is not a closed-loop system or it does
not specify requirements for customizing your RFID solution, you should
aim for interoperability and compatibility with partners’ and vendors’
products throughout the supply chain to achieve the full benefit of
your RFID system.
Why Comply?
Reason number one is that noncompliance will cost you money. New designs
must be compliant with all regulations and standards applicable to the system
and region of operation.Any noncompliance with regulatory bodies can lead to
steep fines and interruption of business, not to mention a potential tarnishing
of your reputation. It is always good business practice to ensure that the manu-

facturers of the hardware you purchase follow the standards applicable to your
system. Properly certified and standardized equipment will make your life with
regulations a lot easier. Reason number two is to help keep interference between
your system and your neighbor’s installed system to a minimum.
Objective 6.2
Frequency Selection
I
f a mandate or particular standard has not defined what operating frequency
your system must use, you must decide which frequency is the best choice for
your system and the results you want to achieve. When making this selection,
keep in mind the size of the interrogation zone in which the tags will be read as
well as the item on which the tag will be placed. Different frequencies have dif-
ferent read ranges and behaviors when using various materials.
High-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) technologies are inductively
coupled technologies that function in the near field. This limits the operational
range for passive systems of this type to 24 inches (0.75 meters) or less for HF
and 36 inches (1 meter) or less for LF. These are typical ranges for standard sys-
tems, so variations in this performance can occur based on the size/type of the
antenna used and power provided. A large antenna used with a passive LF sys-
tem will produce a useable range of about 6 feet (2 meters). Passive inductive
systems utilize the electromagnetic portion of the wavelength and therefore per-
form better around metals and liquids compared to capacitive systems (ultra
high frequency [UHF] and microwave).
UHF and microwave technologies are capacitively coupled; they use the elec-
tric field generated from the reader antenna and are designed to operate in the
far field. Capacitively coupled systems can achieve a much greater useable range
than their inductive counterparts can. Typical ranges for the operation of these
systems are 6 to 12 feet (2 to 4 meters), sometimes up to 25 feet (8 meters). The
read ranges and performance of various frequencies are discussed in detail in
Chapters 2 and 3.
Let’s look at a few specific examples of considerations you’ll need to make. If
you were reading tags on a conveyor line that is 36 inches wide,for example,you
could successfully use HF technology because it has a maximum practical read
range of 24 inches. This fact allows you to place an antenna on either side of the
conveyor,covering the entire volume of space across that conveyor.In a different
example, you may be installing a dock door portal knowing that the distance

158
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
across the dock door is 10 feet (approximately 3 meters).You will choose either a
UHF or microwave frequency system.Both of these systems can achieve the ade-
quate distance to cover that volume of space,while LF and HF systems cannot.
The next phase of design selection is hardware selection. You must select the
specific tags, readers, antennas, and peripheral devices appropriate for your in-
stallation. All these items must interoperate successfully to deliver a solution
that will drive tangible business value for your client.
Objective 6.3
Tag Selection
Y
ou need to evaluate many parameters when selecting tags for your imple-
mentation, such as tag type, read range, operational environment, data
transfer rate, form factor, memory, alternative data storage in case of defective/
damaged tags, and what type of product will be tagged.
Read Range
As you learned in Chapter 3, tags come in three basic types: active, passive, and
semi-passive. These tag types differ mainly by their read range and cost. Active
tags have long read ranges and high prices compared to passive tags. Semi-pas-
sive tags fall somewhere in between, depending on their design and capabilities.
Therefore, if you were trying to read over a great distance beyond a passive tag’s
capabilities and you could not justify the cost of an active tag that would offer
even greater distance, you should select the semi-passive technology.
Active tags are typically used in real-time locating system and can read from
hundreds of feet away. Active tags are expensive relative to passive tags. Passive
tags are used when a low-cost, high-volume solution is needed to track items at
relatively short distances. Semi-passive tags are used when you need a slightly
longer read range and perhaps sensors that will record temperature, vibration,
shock, humidity, and other environmental parameters.
Significant read range differences exist among the different frequencies used
for active tags.Generally,an active tag’s read range increases with decreasing fre-
quency used (if the interrogator- and tag-transmitted power stays the same).
The longer the wavelength, the farther the wave will propagate depending on
available power. For instance, a tag operating at 433 MHz will achieve a farther
read than a microwave tag using the same power output.The data transfer speed
capabilities of various frequencies apply to active tags as they do to passive tags.

CHAPTER 6 Design Selection
159
Travel Assistance
Recent advancements include UHF near-field technologies, which are changing
much of the accepted UHF tag capabilities. UHF near-field tags provide read
ranges from 1 to 3 feet and good performance around metals and water
with high data transfer rates. This text was written in support of the
RFID+ Certification Exam, which does not include data pertaining to this
technology since it was not available at the time the exam was written.
At this point in the process,a frequency should have already been selected for
the particular application you are designing. Given the varying read ranges of
tags with different technologies and different frequency ranges, you’ll find a
large variety of tags on the market. Your choice will dramatically narrow once
the frequency selection process has occurred.
Operational Environment
Knowing the conditions to which the tagged products or objects will be exposed
as they are being interrogated can dramatically assist you in making decisions
regarding the tags as well. If you are choosing tags for use in outdoor applica-
tions, for example, a rugged tag that can be exposed to temperature extremes,
direct sunlight, and rain should be chosen. If your operation moves goods in
and out of a freezer during the handling process, then the tags must be able to
withstand wide temperature variation and possibly humidity. Tag manufactur-
ers will provide datasheets for their tags, which will specify all of the environ-
mental conditions in which the tag can operate.
In specific applications,the only way you’ll be able to find the right tag will be
to test it in the appropriate scenario.Consider sterilization,for example—a pro-
cess used in both produce and pharmaceutical markets. Some types of steriliza-
tion will destroy standard tags, and tag manufacturers may not know whether
your process (such as irradiation, high-pressure washing, or high-temperature
steam cleaning) will affect a product or not. In such a scenario, you should ask
the tag manufacturer for sample tags that you can run through the process in
question to validate the tags’ endurance and survivability.
Data Transfer Rate
The tag’s data transfer rate requirement is driven by how much time the tag can
spend in a particular read zone or how much data will need to be read from or
written to the tag. The data transfer rate increases as the frequency of the system
increases. Low frequency has the slowest data transfer rate; microwave has the
highest data transfer rate.

160
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
In applications where high speed is not required, selection is more about
penetration and range than performance. For example, animal tracking is typi-
cally done with LF technology, since it functions well around liquids (that is,
large bodies such as cattle, zoo animals, pets, and so on) and are read as the ani-
mal is contained within a given area or walking past a reader. Another applica-
tion of this technology is the use of RFID tags in ignition circuits. In this
scenario,read speed is not critical because the key is in the car,close to the reader
as it sits in the “On” position. If the tag is seen, the car starts. If it is not, the car
assumes a counterfeit key is being used and it will not start.
In toll-tracking applications, the tags (usually UHF and microwave for their
fast data transfer rates) usually transmit a simple identity, which is then pro-
cessed by the back-end system to charge the user of this tag for traveling on a
road or bridge.For toll systems,the active technology is often used for enhanced
range so that the data can be processed before the vehicle passes through the
portal constructed on the highway. Some toll systems use specialized passive
UHF tags, such as the toll system in the Dallas/Fort Worth area of the United
States.The system has to capture the tag ID.If the tag is not present or is expired,
a camera system is triggered to take a picture of the vehicle and driver. To fulfill
all of these functions in a matter of seconds, the RFID systems must have suffi-
cient read range,fast data transfer rate,and very fast interface with the back-end
system and a camera.
Form Factor
Many forms of tags are available on the market. You should base your choice on
the tagging volume and application technology as well as the necessary protec-
tion from the environment and physical wear and tear.If you intend to tag boxes
in an automated manner, for example, the tags should come embedded in labels
for integration into existing printing and application systems. The same would
apply to any high-volume tagging application, in which you need to attach a tag
to an item or a shipping container quickly. If you were deploying a system at a
movie theater or sports arena, for example, you would use tags that can be em-
bedded within tickets that will be handed out at admission stands. Another
popular form is a button tag (Figure 6-1) that can be sewn into laundry, at-
tached to bags of money,or placed into cargo containers.For bottles of pharma-
ceutical products, a small tag could fit nicely on the side or bottom of the bottle,
as opposed to tags of larger size that are designed for use on cargo containers
and that must be rugged and readable from greater distances. Alternatively, you
may require tags that can be embedded into pallets or plastic objects as they are
being manufactured and can be used to track those same objects through the
supply chain as well for warranty purposes when they return.

CHAPTER 6 Design Selection
161
Memory
Memory is also a prime consideration during the design selection phase. You
will choose a tag that provides an appropriate amount of memory depending on
how much data and what type of data a customer needs to write to or read from
the tag. Active tags and semi-passive tags can contain larger amounts of mem-
ory than passive tags, because these tags can keep a memory bank powered even
when it is not being queried over a long period of time.
The industry standard for identification number size today is 96 bits.Most of
the tags that house this 96-bit data identifier have a general memory capacity of
256 bits. Currently, passive tags available for use in the global supply chain have
up to 2048 Kbits of storage available. Semi-passive and active tags usually mea-
sure their memory capacity in megabytes of data due to the on-board power.
The source of on-board power may not always be a battery; for instance, it can
be powered from a power source to which a vehicle’s tag is attached.
Larger memory is also required by sensors that are incorporated into a tag to
keep track of sensed conditions. This data can be either transmitted to an inter-
rogator and from there to back-end systems in real time or kept in a tag’s
memory and transferred in batches on demand.
FIGURE 6.1
Button tag (graphic courtesy of Texas Instruments)

Most tags store a simple number that can be transmitted very quickly. This
number is then looked up in a back-end data processing system for the data that
correlates to that specific tag and item. In rare scenarios in which a back-end
data connection is not feasible, you may find tags that store more data directly
on the tag itself. Examples of this can be seen in medical applications where HF
semi-passive tags are used to measure the temperature of blood bags. The tags
can store upwards of 600 data points, and they can provide this data on demand
without any back-end data connection.
Type of Product
When selecting the tag you will be using in your implementation,you must con-
sider the type of product that will be tagged. Some tags are specifically designed
for products containing metal, others are specifically designed for products
containing high moisture materials, and some generic tags are built for applica-
tion onto corrugate that is used for packaging.
Passive tags’operation depends on efficient use of power. The response from
a tag back to the reader can be from a millionth to a billionth of the original
power transmitted to it. This makes proper tagging critical to the reading suc-
cess. All tags undergo a certain amount of detuning when applied to items. For
the most optimal use of power, the resistance of a tag’s antenna should match
the resistance across the chip attached to it. When these values differ, the tag is
wasting some power due to the mismatch.
Local Lingo
Detuning
Detuning is a change in the resistance across the antenna,
which will change the efficiency of the tag.
Tags designed for use on metal (as well as other specialized tags intended for
use on glass, plastics, wood, and other materials) will have a calculated mismatch
in the resistance of the chip and antenna (see Figure 6-2). When the tag is applied
in close proximity to metal, the detuning that occurs will bring these numbers
much closer together. However, this tag cannot be used on nonmetallic surfaces
because it would not get detuned and therefore would not perform according to
specifications. The same considerations apply to any other specialized tags.

Region
As the global RFID market emerges, it will be necessary for tags to be manufac-
tured that will respond reliably in all regions of the world within the UHF band
from 860 to 960 MHz.In the past,tags were designed to resonate at a specific fre-
quency,usually the center of the targeted band.Now manufacturers are working
to create tags with a center band with a very wide range.
Figures 6-3 and 6-4 show network analyzer screens that are measuring response
poweratfourmarkersspreadacross860–960MHz.InFigure6-3,thefirstmarkeris
at 867 MHz for European markets, the second and third markers are 902 and 928
MHz, respectively, to mark the beginning and end of the North American band,
and the fourth marker at 956 MHz represents the Asian market band. Each hori-
zontal line represents a 5 dBm variance from the line above or below.
Travel Advisory
Remember, dBm measures changes in power from a known source.
A 3 dBm increase equates to double power, and a 3 dBm loss
equates to half power.
AsyoucanseeinFigure6-3,thetagrepresentedwouldperformbestintheAsian
market, not very well in the European market, and it would have very sporadic re-
sults in the North American market. A 5 dBm difference in power from the start of
the North American range to the end of the North American range would show a
dramatic difference in performance as the reader hops between frequencies in this
range. Your goal is to provide reliable, predicable results as your product ships
throughout the world. Figure 6-4 presents a tag that provides relatively equal per-
formance around the world (a world tag). (The testing shown here, as well as the
photos, are provided compliments of Venture Research in Plano, Texas.)

World tag
A world tag offers little variance between the frequencies
recorded, providing consistent results irrespective of where in the world it
is used. Therefore, it is suitable for tagging objects moving through an
international supply chain.
Objective 6.4
Interrogator Selection
A
fter choosing the appropriate tag for your installation, you must ensure
that the interrogator you select can operate on the appropriate frequency,
can support the protocols of the tag, has the capability to integrate with the
back-end system through the appropriate interfaces, and can survive the condi-
tions associated with the environment within which it will operate.
The frequency of the interrogator should have already been chosen when you
selected an operational frequency for your tags. The frequency of the interroga-
tor must match the frequency of the tag or your system will not work.
The protocols supported by the interrogator must all match the tags you se-
lected for your implementation. Likewise, if you are accepting tags from trading
partners, your interrogators must also support the protocols that your trading
partners use. Several multi-protocol readers on the market will allow you to
choose one or more protocols, according to your needs. However, if you choose
more than one protocol, the reader will perform slower because it has to run
through all chosen protocols when scanning for the tags in the interrogation zone.
In addition, it is a good idea to ensure that your readers can upgrade or change
FIGURE 6.4
Fairly even power response across 860–960 MHz

protocols (usually through firmware upgrades) based on changes in the market,
so that you do not end up with an obsolete reader as new protocols emerge.
Readers can be also selected according to their communication capabilities.
Many readers today have general-purpose I/O (GPIO) ports that can be config-
ured to drive specific applications and that have direct integration capabilities
with light stacks, light break sensors, and a wide variety of I/O devices. Also,
many readers have internal processors and operating systems that can run soft-
ware directly on the reader, which lets it act as an edge server that will filter and
aggregate data prior to handing it off to the back-end system.
The interfaces the reader supports must match the network that you have in-
stalled currently at a facility. If you have a wireless network employed and want
to add your readers to it, they must support the security methods used on your
network. If the readers do not have wireless capability built in, external wireless
adapters can be used that connect to any standard Ethernet port,which are pres-
ent in most readers.
Another important consideration is the environment in which the reader is
being installed. If the reader is being mounted on a forklift or on a material-han-
dling vehicle, for instance, it will be exposed to shock and vibration, and most
consumer electronics are built to withstand only 5Gs of shock. The amount of
shock experienced by a fully loaded forklift as it drives around the warehouse can
be up to 20Gs on a regular basis. If the RFID equipment will be exposed to these
types of conditions, they must be certified by the manufacturer to survive if you
expect them to live in that environment for very long. To see what happens when
the environmental factors are not properly considered, see Figure 6-5.

Objective 6.5
Antenna Selection
A
fter choosing the appropriate reader for your application, you must select
the antennas. Antennas are selected based on their polarization, gain, rug-
gedness, size, cable, and mounting options.
Polarization
Antennas can be either circularly or linearly polarized. Circular antennas are
used in implementations for which the orientation of a tag cannot be assured.
Circular antennas typically have a shorter range than their linear counterparts;
however, they will assure that the tag is readable regardless of the angle/orienta-
tion of the product/container at which the antenna is directed.
Linear antennas read larger distances than circular antennas but require
tagged objects to be in the same orientation every time they are presented to the
antenna.A good example of a linear antenna’s use would be on a manufacturing
line, where machines are placing objects on conveyors for movement through a
facility. If a machine places any object on a conveyor line, each object should be
placed in the same orientation and position on the line. Linear antennas offer
better penetration of dense objects—consider, for example, a company reading
tags through rolls of paper. Bulk paper is dense and contains a lot of moisture;
therefore,a linear antenna stands a much better chance of penetrating the whole
role than a circular antenna.
Exam Tip
Know that to achieve even better results, you can place a right-hand circular
polarized antenna next to a left-hand circular polarized antenna.
Assuming they are run by one reader, the waves will always be at
different angles and should provide a more efficient read performance.
The polarization of an antenna is discussed in detail in Chapters 1,2,and 4.
Gain
The gain of an antenna plays a huge role in the results your interrogation zone
will achieve. The higher the gain of an antenna, the narrower the beam of that
same antenna. A higher gain means that you will be able to read tags at a greater
distance with this antenna. However, higher gain also means that the antenna
will provide a narrower beam; therefore, if the tags are in motion while being
read, they will spend less time in a narrower beam than they will in a wider

beam. If you need to read tags at relatively short distance but want to achieve a
longer dwell time,you should use an antenna with a lower gain,because this will
cause the beam to be wider but with a relatively short read range. Typical supply
chain antennas for passive RFID systems have a gain of 6 to 8 dB. (Antenna gain
is covered in detail in Chapter 2.) Low- and high-gain antenna beams are repre-
sented in Figures 6-6 and 6-7.
HF and LF antennas are not directional. They propagate a signal equally in a
manner that is perpendicular to the coil of the antenna. To increase the range of
the antenna, you must increase the size of the coil or the power provided to it.
The read range of these frequencies is driven by the practical size for an antenna.
Installation and maintenance of huge antennas is more costly and more prob-
lematic than simply using a frequency more suited for a specific application.
Ruggedness
An antenna must be selected based on its abilities to withstand its environment.
Lightweight and inexpensive antennas can be used in retail environments that
are temperature controlled and have protection built around the antenna. For
example, the antennas can be built into a countertop for a cash register, where
they will never be touched by the goods while tags are being read.
However,if you are mounting antennas at a warehouse dock door,they are often
exposed to sun, rain, snow, wind, and other elements. The antennas are also ex-
posed to vehicles driving by and personnel working nearby, all of which can acci-
dentally run into them. Antennas for use on a forklift need to be extra rugged and

able to withstand direct impact from cargo on the forks. A rugged antenna may be
needed on baggage handling devices that can be used indoors or outdoors.For such
conditions,you must select a rugged antenna if you expect it to survive without ad-
ditional protection. Covers can be also used to protect exposed antennas.
Size
The size of the antenna must also be considered. The size must be practical and
fit the application you are designing.If the antenna is to be embedded within an
object, obviously the antenna must be smaller than that object.
Although bistatic readers offer better performance in difficult read situa-
tions, their use may be impractical due to a relatively large size of a bistatic an-
tenna compared to a monostatic antenna. A bistatic reader needs two antennas
(in separate cases or joined in one case) to function,while the monostatic reader
will utilize one smaller antenna.
Mounting Options
Mounting options available with the antenna could also help you with your selec-
tion. Check out what the specific antenna models offer (holes for screws, flexible
joints, and so on) to determine which mounting option will be the best for your
system. You may want to use screws, zip ties, adhesives, industrial Velcro, or other
options. Breakaway antenna mounts are similar to the breakaway mirrors in-
stalled on cars—these are certainly advisable if you know that the antennas may
be occasionally hit by a vehicle or other equipment. Mounting options will not
change your antenna’s performance but will be important for installation and
long-term maintenance.
Antennas can be mounted in readymade dock stands that hold from two to
four antennas (and a reader and certain I/Os), which are protected by an im-
pact-resistant cover. Antenna mounts designed for forklifts embed antennas
near the mast of the truck and offer a good degree of protection as well,ensuring
antennas are close to the goods the truck is carrying and yet protected enough to
expect a reasonable lifespan. For antennas on conveyors, extruded aluminum
frames can be constructed that surround a section of conveyor to allow anten-
nas to be safely placed in close proximity.
Travel Advisory
You can mount this equipment in your facility in many ways. The factors that
will drive your decision are cost, form factor, and environmental survival.
Note that if you let cost be the primary factor, and you go for low-cost
but inappropriate solutions, your selection may cost you a lot more
over the long term.

Objective 6.6
Cable Selection
T
ypically,RFID antennas come with cables enclosed.These cables can be used
when the antennas are within the distance of the cable length from the inter-
rogator. However, in extreme circumstances, where the antenna may be placed
well beyond the distance of the original cable, additional cable can be purchased
and inserted into the path from the reader to the antenna. The cables used to feed
RFID antennas are coaxial cables with a center conductor that is solid wire and a
multi-stranded, braided outer conductor that is separated by a dielectric.
If you are sending a signal across a great distance, a thicker cable is more ad-
vantageous as it loses less of the signal. Although all cables experience loss, thin-
ner cables have a higher amount of loss than thicker cables at the same
frequency.The disadvantage of thicker cables is that they have a smaller bend ra-
dius than thinner cables and thus cannot be used in applications where the con-
duit must bend 90 degrees or more.
Exam Tip
Remember that the thicker and shorter the cable, the lower the signal
loss and the lower the bend radius.
Objective 6.7
Peripherals Selection
Y
ou can add peripherals to an RFID system to enhance its capabilities, such
as RFID-enabled printers,smart label printer applicators,light stacks,trig-
gering devices, and extrasensory networks. The integration of a well-planned
system can include many different types of input and output devices.
RFID Printers and Label Applicators
Printers are used for rapid integration into existing systems where barcodes may
be used. An RFID-enabled printer can easily replace an existing label printer,
providing the production line with the ability to place RFID tags onto objects
they regularly handle.Smart label printer applicators can put labels on products
in an automated fashion if the products are all of the same approximate size and
presented at a regular interval. An automatic smart label printer applicator can
certainly increase the efficiency of RFID tagging. However, for lower tagging
volumes, you may select a handheld label applicator or manual application.

Printer variables such as protocols, interfaces, label width, error handling,
and others are discussed in detail in Chapter 5.
Light Stacks and Triggering Devices
Light stacks, horns, and display devices are used for notifying an operator about
a particular condition the system may be experiencing. Choosing the appropri-
ate alert will ensure the correct action is taken to correspond to the condition.
Choosing the wrong alert will result in missed events and an ineffective system.
If you are sending an alert, ensure that it is seen or heard. In brightly lit areas,
an audible alert may be best.In noisy environments,a visible alert should do the
job. Because of variable conditions, no absolute correct selection criteria exist.
You should, however, ensure that the signal is not wasted and that the notifica-
tion devices can survive the environmental conditions in which they are placed.
Triggering devices are used to let the system know when a tagged object has
entered the area. Triggering devices can be proximity sensors, motion detectors,
light break sensors, weight sensors, button presses, and other devices.
Objective 6.8
Software Selection
T
he software used to run and integrate the RFID system must be compatible
with the hardware that you selected and the back-end systems to which you
are integrating.Standards for RFID middleware and data management software
are still emerging; therefore, when selecting software today, ensure that it will be
upgradeable in the future and that your in-house staff can support it.
In an enterprise-wide deployment, hundreds of devices will have to be man-
aged by a single middleware platform. Therefore, when choosing middleware,
you must ensure that it will be able to handle the workload. Some of the other
features you may want to look into are device health status monitoring (for in-
stance, using Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)) device manage-
ment capabilities, data filtering and aggregation, and automated exception
handling.Software licensing and maintenance costs in a large installation can be
very substantial and must be considered early on in the planning stage.
Objective 6.9
Shielding and Equipment
Protection
O
nce you have a more complete picture of the overall design, you can look at
the overall environment in which the system is operating upon installation.

Electrical noise and interference, vibration, temperature and humidity, indoor or
outdoor installation, and potential system abuse are all key points of consider-
ation for the environment.
If your interrogation zone is near a conveyor with large motors or a number
of other readers are nearby,it may encounter RF interference.To solve this prob-
lem, you may need to install shielding material such as chain-link fence or
anechoic foam (Figure 6-8). Grounded chain-link fence makes an excellent RF
shield as long as the distance between intersections is less than a quarter the
wavelength of the frequency being used. In addition to shielding, you can install
software to manage and synchronize the readers and other equipment to reduce
or eliminate interference.
The vibration, temperature, and humidity to which the equipment will be
exposed will help you determine the need for rugged equipment,reader enclo-
sures (such as Ingress Protection (IP) or NEMA—National Electrical Manu-
facturers Association), or possibly special enclosures with ventilation or
temperature controls built into the box.
If the equipment is being installed where it is exposed to outdoor conditions,
you should take extra precautions to protect the equipment from environmental
elements. In indoor installations, the equipment can suffer from electrostatic dis-
charge (ESD), especially in extremely dry environments. For environments that
are excessively prone to ESD, you can ensure that equipment and tags are not
damaged:
•
Tags should be stored in antistatic (conductive) bags (Figure 6-9).
•
Areas in which a lot of sensitive electronics operate should have
conductive floor mats installed.
•
Particularly problematic areas can be treated by installing air ionizers
to reduce the probability of static discharge (Figure 6-10).
•
All electronics that are installed in a complete system should be
grounded to minimize the potential for static damage.

✔Objective 6.1: Standards, Mandates, and Regulatory Compliance
When

national, regional, and local standards and regulations to ensure proper per-
formance, interoperability, and safety. You may also need to follow mandates
supplied by your trading partners or customers.

✔Objective 6.3: Tag Selection
Tag selection is so closely tied to frequency
selection that the Objective 6.2,“Frequency Selection”table works for tag se-
lection too! Make a point to know this table well.
✔Objective 6.4: Interrogator Selection
You must select the interrogators
according to environment, mandates, and standards and their performance
will depend on the frequency, whether the system is active or passive, what
power is supplied,the type of antenna and tag used,functions of the interro-
gator (filtering, anti-collision, dense reader mode), as well as interference
from other interrogators or the environment.
✔Objective 6.5: Antenna Selection
Antennas are selected based on their
polarization, gain, ruggedness, size, cable, and mounting options.
•
Linearly polarized antennas are better when the tag orientation is
known, and they penetrate dense objects better and achieve longer read
range when compared to a circular antenna with the same power input.
•
Circularly polarized antennas are better when the tag orientation is not
fixed.

174
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
•
Higher gain antennas are better for achieving longer read ranges with a
more focused beam, while lower gain antennas are better for achieving
a wider beam and therefore a longer dwell time.
•
LF and HF antennas are not directional.
•
You must select antennas according to the environment in which they
will be used—on vehicles or by dock doors, use rugged antennas or
special protective measures such as covers.
•
When concerned about size, choose monostatic antennas rather than
bistatic.
✔Objective 6.6: Cable Selection
When selecting a cable, remember that
the longer the cable, the greater the signal loss. The thicker the cable, the
lower the loss but the lower the bend radius. The higher the frequency, the
higher the loss. Therefore, you should use shorter cables if possible, but if
you must shorten them more than the manufacturer recommends, you
must lower the interrogator power output so as not to surpass the limit for
radiated power.
✔Objective 6.7: Peripherals Selection
To enhance your RFID system, you
can use the following peripherals: RFID-enabled printers; smart label
printer applicators for printing; smart label encoding and application; light
stacks,horns,and other feedback devices to signal changes in the system per-
formance; triggering devices to start and stop interrogation; and extrasen-
sory networks to provide the RFID system with the ability to monitor
movement, temperature, and other environmental conditions.
✔Objective 6.8: Software Selection
When selecting software for your
RFID systems, look for software with device health status monitoring, de-
vice management capabilities, data filtering and aggregation, automated ex-
ception handling, and other similar features.
✔Objective 6.9: Shielding and Equipment Protection
Equipment must be
protected from physical damage as well as interference. Interference can be
caused by other readers in the environment but also any other devices that
are working on the same or similar frequency, such as wireless LANs, large
motors, microwave ovens, cordless phones, and cell phones or malfunction-
ing devices that create the same frequency signal, such as speakers, convey-
ors, forklifts, and so on. To solve interference problems, you may have to
install shielding material such as a chain-link fence or anechoic foam. In ad-
dition to shielding, you can install software to manage and synchronize the
readers and other equipment to reduce or eliminate interference.
For antennas on conveyors, use extruded aluminum frames; antennas at
dock doors should be encased into rugged stands with transparent covers in

front of the antenna.Antenna mounts designed for forklifts embed antennas
near the mast of the truck, which offers a good degree of protection.

In this chapter, you will learn about installation techniques for successful RFID
implementation. RFID installations should follow the same basic principles of
other technology implementations, such as wireless networks. The big differ-
ence between RFID installations and those of other technologies is the configu-
ration of the actual interrogation zones (IZs), since understanding IZs will be
critical to your installations’ success.
Objective 7.1
Preinstallation
P
rior to installation, you should study your installation manual and a site di-
agram. You should also perform basic equipment testing as well as other
necessary network checks to ensure a correct and successful installation.
Site Diagrams
Typically, an installer will receive a site diagram with the installation documents.
This can range from a photocopy of a fire escape plan that has been marked up
to show installation points to a full-blown blueprint that has been modified
professionally to indicate power outlets; data connections; heating, ventilation,
and air-conditioning (HVAC); wiring closets; safety walkways; and other im-
portant aspects. An example of a site diagram is shown on the next page.
Preinstall Equipment Testing
It is always a good idea to make certain that the equipment you will be installing
in the field works prior to bringing it to the site. By taking this extra step, you
minimize the onsite time needed for installation, therefore causing as little dis-
ruption on the site as possible. To test and prepare the equipment for installation,
follow these steps:
1. Assemble, set up, and configure all peripherals and ancillary devices
with the appropriate settings. This includes Programmable Logic
Controllers (PLCs), input sensors, and output devices.
2. Configure all general-purpose I/O (GPIO) settings on the interrogator
and connect the peripheral devices to the interrogator.

3. Install a local PC configured with the client’s network data.
4. Connect the interrogator and PC to a local communications hub
and send a ping or query to the device ensuring successful
communication.

182
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
When setting up the peripherals prior to connecting them to an interrogator,
you should always “breadboard” the components (connect them using short
test cables on a tabletop without mounting) before mounting them into place
and connecting to power. Sometimes, you may need the components to be
placed in a National Electrical Manufacturers Associations (NEMA) enclosure.
In this case, you should do the following:
1. Breadboard the components first to ensure that everything functions as
expected.
2. Lay out the enclosure in a logical order to ensure that the equipment has
the appropriate clearance around it to accommodate cable bend radius
and that proper ventilation and maintenance access are available. This
will also help you determine whether the cable lengths and types are
appropriate for the installation.
3. Physically mount components to the backboard of the NEMA box and
install the assembled backboard in the box.
4. Connect all components.
5. Connect to power.
After configuring the GPIO of an interrogator and connecting the peripher-
als,you should test the system by attempting to read a tag.This should power the
appropriate output device. If this does not occur, you should do the following:
1. Check all connections.
2. Check configurations.
3. Test individual components.
4. Replace or reconfigure nonfunctioning elements and solve the
problem!
When configuring communication settings in order to connect with the cli-
ent’s network, you will need to know and set up the following:
•
For Ethernet or wireless Ethernet communications, configure the IP
address, subnet mask, gateway, and appropriate security settings.
•
For serial communications, configure the port settings such as the baud
rate, bits per second, parity, stop bits, and flow control.

After you are done with the configuration, reboot the device and ensure that
the settings were saved.
Once all of these steps have been completed, place all the equipment in the
shipping crates and ship it to the installation site (be sure to package the compo-
nents properly to prevent any damage in transit). By pretesting and preassem-
bling the equipment, you ensure that the installation will be much easier for
your clients and much easier on your installers, and the time you spend onsite
will be more effectively utilized.
Preinstall Checks
Upon arrival at the installation site, a number of checks should be performed to
ensure a smooth installation. You should determine the following:
•
Whether you have the proper ladders, lifts, and safety equipment
needed to reach the equipment that you are hanging overhead
•
Whether all antenna locations or proposed locations for the
interrogation zone have adequate access for optimization of the
antennas as well as long-term maintenance
•
Whether the antenna and its angle and height can or should be varied
for the application
•
Whether the antenna radiation can cause multipath reflections, for
instance due to metallic structures or surfaces nearby that can reflect
RF waves (these structures and surfaces may need to be covered with
electromagnetic interference [EMI] absorbing materials)
•
Whether readers can be placed in close proximity to the antennas they
power (to avoid signal strength loss due to long cables)
•
Whether the readers can be placed in such a way that the status
indicators are easily visible to an operator for troubleshooting and
long-term maintenance
•
Whether the equipment is close to the travel path of vehicles or
personnel (you may need to apply additional protective measures
for the equipment)
•
Whether appropriate cables and wiring are installed in the right place
or adequate space exists to run new wiring as required
•
Whether all cabling and wiring complies with industry standards
CHAPTER 7 Installation
183

184
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
•
Whether all brackets and mounts are in place, or you have space to
install them
•
Whether the power line is properly grounded
Travel Assistance
You must ensure that readers are mounted per the manufacturer’s
instructions and are well protected against physical damage.
As you do with any system installation, you have only a certain amount of
time to get the job done. Therefore, to avoid interruptions and delays, you must
ensure that you have all the tools you need to finish the job. For example, you
may need screwdrivers, wire cutters, zip ties, a soldering iron and solder, black
tape, and power tools such as drills or saws. Take a quick inventory of your
equipment to ensure that you have everything necessary for the installation, as
well as some spare equipment in case you need it. Don’t forget spare RFID read-
ers, connectors/adaptors, and cabling.
Exam Tip
A best practice is to make sure that the cable length from the reader to
the antenna matches wave specifications for a particular frequency.
Basically, you should cut the cable in increments of a half or a full
wavelength of the frequency you are using.
Objective 7.2
Hardware Installation
A
n RFID system can require the installation of antennas, RFID readers,
RFID-enabled printer applicators, and RFID peripherals. This equipment
can be also installed in larger configurations such as RFID portals or tunnels, as
shown in Figure 7-1. These may be built into devices such as dock doors or per-
sonnel doors, conveyor systems, sortation devices, encoding stations, or forklift
trucks.

Antenna Installation
An antenna is one of the most critical components in an RFID system. It is also
the most exposed part. Antennas must be close to the goods as they are being
read. You need to know the antenna’s orientation, approximate read range, and
the footprint of the area that it will cover.Most antenna manufacturers include a
datasheet or whitepaper that you can use to estimate the radiation pattern. If
you are using multiple antennas, your antenna read zones should overlap
slightly to enhance the probability of obtaining the reads as the tags travel
through that IZ.
Mounting Antennas
The best practice for mounting antennas is to mount them on a flexible joint of
some sort. By using a joint, you can adjust the antenna angles and modify your
read zone area, and the antenna will give way with little pressure to swing away
from potential harm, as goods or vehicles could impact it during their travel
through the read zone.

Beamwidth
Datasheets or whitepapers for antennas normally report the
beamwidth as the point at which the power drops 50 percent or 3 dB from the
centerofthebeamasittravelstotheleftorrightofthebeamorupordown. Note
that tags can be read outside of this area; this definition simply provides
an estimate based on industry-standard of 50 percent power loss.
In the case of a monostatic reader, one antenna is used for both transmit-
ting and receiving functions. In the case of a bistatic reader, two separate an-
tennas and two separate ports perform these functions. If you use separate
transmit and receive antennas, the corresponding pairs should not be
mounted directly opposite each other.Because the transmit antenna transmits
a powerful RF signal and the tags respond with a little power, the receive an-
tenna would not be able to differentiate between the original transmission and
the tag’s response.
Travel Advisory
Do not disconnect an antenna when the read mode of the reader is
turned on!
If the interrogator comes with terminators, be sure to place them on unused
antenna ports before turning on the unit.It is a best practice to protect all anten-
nas with RF transparent panels and covers, concrete bollards, breakaway
mounting brackets, and other protective equipment. (We will mention this

CHAPTER 7 Installation
187
when discussing portal installation in the “RFID Tunnel Installation” section
later in this chapter.)
To determine whether the radiation patterns from each read zone overlap,
you should walk the space around your zone with a working tag to see if it can be
read outside the IZ. If this is the case, adjustment of power or installation of
RF-absorbent shielding materials may be required.
Antenna Cable Considerations
When installing antennas, you must pay special attention to cables that connect
antennas to the reader.Feeder cable selection is important to limit reductions in
antenna output. Cables will attenuate RF signals (the longer the cable the larger
the attenuation or loss); therefore, keeping the cables as short as possible is im-
portant. If you require longer cables for your installation, you will need to select
lower loss cables, which will increase power delivered to the antenna as well as
the cost of the installation.
Attenuation values as well as the minimum bend radius for the cables are
available from the cable manufacturer. The general rules for cable performance
are as follows:
•
The thicker the cable, the smaller the loss experienced during the travel
of the signal on the cable.
•
The thicker the cable, the smaller the minimum bend radius.
•
As frequency increases on a cable, the amount of attenuation also
increases. A 13.56 MHz system, for instance, will experience less loss on
the exact same cable than a 915 MHz system.
Reader Installation
You should follow these rules when installing readers:
•
Mount readers securely so that they are not disturbed, bumped, or
damaged during regular business operations.
•
Leave 5 to 6 inches of clearance on all sides of the reader, except on
the bottom of a reader that has shock-absorbing mounts (the rubber
feet attached to the bottom of most interrogators). This clearance is
necessary in order to avoid cable strain when plugging cables into the
reader, especially if you run them out of the box through conduit with
the rest of the cables.

•
Ensure that the reader is placed and installed in accordance with the
recommendations of the manufacturer to keep your warranty valid.
•
If environmental enclosures (such as IP or NEMA enclosures) are
required for the protection of the readers, make sure that you use
a correct type of enclosure and that you install it correctly.
•
Place readers in a way that will make the status indicator lights or LEDs
visible to an operator or other personnel; this can assist you with exception
processing and troubleshooting.If you are using an enclosure,you may need
to install a window or a light panel/stack for notification of a device failure.
Travel Advisory
When installing electronics, you should couple them with a triggering device that
will ensure the unit is active only when needed. It is best practice to turn off
devices when they are not in use, as this will increase the lifespan
of the equipment, lower ambient RF noise in the facility, and lower
the mean time between failure (MTBF) of the equipment.
After Reader Installation
After installing a reader, you should perform a few simple checks to make sure
that the reader functions correctly:
•
Perform a simple power-on test to ensure that all the lights and
appropriate feedback mechanisms are connected and talking to
the reader.
•
Make sure that the reader is connected to the host system correctly. You
can do this typically by pinging the device across the network to ensure
the network connectivity.

CHAPTER 7 Installation
189
Local Lingo
Pinging
“Pinging the device” refers to sending a ping command to a networked
device using its IP address from a host in order to find out if it responds or not. If
the networked device is communicating, the response to a ping command
will typically be a reply with data packets. If the device is not communica-
ting, the host will see “Request timed out”.
•
Validate the reader’s configuration parameters. Make sure nothing has
changed from the time you set it up and that you can successfully read
tag data. This test is usually performed prior to connecting the reader
to the back-end data network.
•
If an extra antenna cable is used, wind the whole cable length into a
coil to keep the cable out of harm’s way. Feeder wires running from
the reader to the antennas should be of approximately equal length
to ensure equal power delivery to transmit and receive pairs of the
antennas.
•
Ensure that the cables are not running through the same conduit or in
the immediate proximity of power lines; otherwise, interference in the
system could occur along with an inconsistent delivery of power to the
antennas.

Ancillary Devices Installation
Once the readers and antennas have been installed, you can install the ancillary
devices—photo sensors, pressure sensors, motion sensors, printers, label appli-
cators, and other devices. Follow the general rules for antenna, reader, and
printer installation (for printer installation, see Chapter 5) by following the
device manufacturer’s installation guidelines.
Interrogation Portal Installation
A portal can be used at the dock door, the personnel door, or any kind of door-
way, entrance, or exit. A portal reader configuration is intended to identify
objects with RFID tags as they pass through the doorway entering or leaving a
facility. An example of an interrogation portal is shown in Figure 7-2.
Tags are often mounted on objects, cases, or pallets that are being moved in
and out of a distribution center of a warehouse. Tags can be also mounted on
material handling devices, tools and equipment, as well as people and other as-
sets that are important to the business. The location or the last location of these
objects can be tracked as they pass through the interrogation portals.
190
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
FIGURE 7.2
Interrogation portal

Note that the height of objects traveling through the portals can vary. For in-
stance, if a distribution center were to ship double-stacked pallets, an additional
set of antennas may need to be added to the top of the portal to cover the volume
of space that the second pallet will occupy.
Generally, tags will not be written at the portal because you cannot assure
speed, height, or angle of the objects and tags as they travel through the IZ. It is
often impossible to read 100 percent of the cases on the pallet as it traverses the
portal; therefore,it is important that you understand that cases can be identified
through data aggregation as well.
When designing the portal, you must accommodate the size of the doorway.
Standard dock doors are 10 feet wide (approximately 3 meters), and ramp-loading
doors can be up to 14 or 17 feet wide (approximately 4 to 5 meters).For wider por-
tals, you may need to adjust power levels and antenna types (gain) to produce a
consistent read field across the whole distance.
You should understand the movement of goods to the doorway and the loading
or unloading patterns of that particular facility prior to designing and installing a
portal. The approximate speed of travel through the portal is another important
consideration. Travel speed will help you determine how wide the antenna beams
need to be to keep the tags within field long enough to assure maximum readability.
You should know the maximum (or expected) amount of tags to be read per pallet,
vehicle speeds and routes, and you should configure the portals accordingly. You
must also recognize the physical robustness of the equipment that is going to be
employed in the read IZ to ensure that the RFID equipment will not be easily dam-
aged and will survive the environment in which it must operate.
In a portal, a circular antenna is often used, since the orientation of the tags
entering the IZ cannot be guaranteed. Ensuring the proper overlap between in-
ward-facing antennas is also critical to achieve successful reads in the IZ. The
antenna fields should overlap where the tags will most likely travel. Don’t forget
that the width of the antenna is being narrowed as you get closer to the antenna,
as discussed in Chapter 2. Therefore, the antennas should be set up for the
tagged objects to travel at least 1.5 to 2 feet from the face of the antenna. If the
tags were too close to the antenna mounting structure, the width of the IZ
would be so small that the tags could pass outside of the coverage area.
It is prudent to angle the antennas 25 to 45 degrees into or away from the
path of travel of the objects traversing the IZ.This will dramatically help you in-
crease the likelihood of communication with tags as their time in the IZ or the
dwell time of the tag is increased (see Figure 7-3). As discussed earlier, antennas
with lower gains have wider beams and antennas with higher gain have nar-
rower beams; therefore, you may want to use a lower gain antenna to achieve a
wider beam and longer dwell time if the distance the antenna covers is sufficient.
CHAPTER 7 Installation
191

For this reason, you should use an antenna with the least amount of gain that
can be used to cover the half of the door on which that antenna reads.
Post-installation Performance Measures
One of the performance measures for portals post-installation is the percentage
of tags read, which is the likelihood of a tag on the object being read as it passes
through the portal.For instance,if 100 boxes pass through the portal on a pallet,
and only 80 of them are read (because products are made of RF-difficult materi-
als), the percentage of tags read is 80 percent. This number should be set as an
expectation with the client as well as a baseline for troubleshooting later.
The next performance measure is spurious tag reads.Spurious tag reads occur
when tags are read where they should not have been. This can happen when
tagged objects are accidentally read by the portal, although they are just passing
by or are staged nearby. This is usually caused by unwanted reflections of the
portal’s antenna or excessive power settings. The system should monitor all
data, and if unexpected tags are read—for instance, tags on goods staged for
shipping that are not being loaded—it should filter this data out. A well-de-
signed system will recognize the event,record the spurious read,and alert an ad-
ministrator for analysis.
The following can help eliminate spurious reads:
•
A new standard operating procedure (SOP) can be instituted that will
make employees maintain “safe distance” from an active portal when
dealing with tagged goods.
•
Power in the interrogation zone could be lowered to keep the antennas
from reaching distant tags.
•
Directional antennas can be used in these types of installations to
reduce spurious tag reads. Antennas with high gain and a well-defined
primary beam will limit the coverage of an unwanted area.

•
If the direction of the tagged items is known, a separate set of antennas
for inbound and outbound reading can be installed, facing in or out of
the warehouse, respectively. To reduce the chance of overlap dramatically,
alternating dock doors could be used for shipping and receiving goods.
RFID Tunnel Installation
When building a conveyor IZ or a tunnel, remember that every tag that passes
through the tunnel must be read. To achieve this result, you must understand
the speed and separation of moving tags, the typical physical size of cases/units,
as well as the reading environment, such as metal rollers on the conveyor. The
advantage of installing a tunnel on a conveyor is a predictability of factors, such
as the speed of the object passing through the IZ or the number of tags in the IZ
at any given time. Another advantage is the fact that the read distance is much
smaller compared to a doorway portal.
Best practices on a conveyor (in a tunnel or conveyor portal) are using the di-
rectional antennas to limit the read field to the immediate item moving on the
conveyor surface and reducing power to avoid interference among other readers
or reading items on adjacent conveyors.
RFID tunnels usually come preassembled for easy installation. You can simply
connect them to a power and network and configure the readers with recom-
mended parameters. If your tunnel comes without the RFID equipment, you
will need to install the antennas and a reader.Tunnels usually include mounts or
holders for attaching the antennas and a reader as well as space to run the cables.
You should follow the tunnel manufacturer’s instructions to mount and install
the RFID equipment and the tunnel itself.
Encoding Station Installation
Encoding stations are often installed simply to meet the mandates of down-
stream trading partners, known as “slap and ship.” A typical encoding sta-
tion, as shown in Figure 7-4, includes a network-connected computer, a

194
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
barcode reader, and an RFID interrogator as a validation point for the newly
applied tags.
Installing a computer connected to the back-end system allows transfer of
data for the objects to be tagged.Normally,the system will have a barcode reader
attached to read existing barcode information on a package. This information
can be processed by the computer and used to generate the RFID-enabled smart
label that will be applied on the same box. Post application, the box will be sent
through a read point to ensure that the tags are still readable.
Installation on a Vehicle
A forklift truck installation is by far one of the most complex installations of all.
Selection of equipment for forklift installation is critical to the success of the op-
eration, as all equipment must meet the environmental specifications found on
a forklift truck, including shock, G forces and vibration, environmental ex-
tremes such as temperature and humidity, and possible exposure to elements
such as rain, wind, or snow. You must also consider how the forklifts are used in
the business as well as what items they are picking up and moving.
FIGURE 7.4
Verification tunnel on a conveyor

For a proper installation of the equipment on the forklift, you must do the
following:
•
Use shock absorbing mounts when mounting readers.
•
Mount readers close to antennas to limit the cable length (to minimize
the signal loss, as discussed earlier).
•
Mount the antennas discretely so that they can obtain the appropriate
read but will not be subject to the damage typically associated with
being at such close proximity to the objects being read (see Figure 7-5
for an example of antennas mounted on a forklift).
•
Deliver power and data connections between the truck and the reader.
For readers attached to the lift of the forklift, buying hydraulic hoses
that have embedded wiring can be extremely advantageous to reduce
the possibility of cable damage.
•
Ensure operator safety by mounting the reader and the antennas out of
line of sight of the operator who is performing normal functions with
the forklift.
CHAPTER 7 Installation
195
FIGURE 7.5
Vehicle-mounted antennas between forklift forks

Finding the way to tie the reader and the antennas to the back-end data system
can be challenging on a forklift installation. You can often use a vehicle mount
computer or vehicle mount terminal that communicates with the back-end sys-
tem wirelessly. The reader will read the tags, and then pass the data to the vehicle
mount computer via a serial connection, which will then filter and aggregate that
data and turn it into tangible business events that can be processed by the existing
warehouse management system or business transaction processing system.
A vehicle-mounted computer or terminal with a screen will also provide the
driver with the information about the product he/she is supposed to pick up,
product location, whether the tag on the product was read, and where the prod-
uct belongs. This system ensures efficiency of workers and minimizes problems
caused by faulty tags and misplaced products. An example of a computer screen
in such a system is shown in Figure 7-6.
Access Control Installation
Access control points often use RFID-enabled security systems.Instead of track-
ing boxes through a portal or tunnel for inventory management purposes, these
points are used to guarantee or refuse access to people moving in and out of sen-
sitive business locations. By using the data collected by these systems, you can
also track movement and location of personnel.

representation of the warehouse, including information
about the product to be loaded.

CHAPTER 7 Installation
197
Many of these systems use HF technology, but they are not limited to it. Ac-
cess control points can employ the use of power locks or access gates that func-
tion similarly to a divert gate sorting boxes on a conveyor. The device responds
to the data the reader has seen and the criteria defined for the object attached to
the tag.
Objective 7.3
Grounding
Considerations
P
rior to plugging in readers or electronic components, you must check the
grounding at the site. Three types of grounds are used: power line ground,
local ground, and RF ground. When these grounds are different, potential
ground loops can develop. For this reason, all components in an RFID system
should be grounded to a common ground.
Prior to installation, you should stop at an electronics store and spend $5 on
an inexpensive ground fault device that will indicate the condition of the power
line. Simply plugging in the meter will give you a status of the line with three in-
dication lights. The lights will turn on to indicate whether you have reverse po-
larity, neutral reverse, or disconnected ground. Many line conditions can be
quickly assessed using this type of meter. (Never try to fix these issues yourself.
Instead, call a licensed and qualified electrician to take care of the job.)
Travel Advisory
Installing surge protectors for the equipment is a good idea. Spend
additional money on a UPS so that the A/C power can be filtered
prior to delivery to the electronic devices.

198
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Remember that the equipment mounted on material handling devices such as
a forklift conveyor or other device should be grounded to the frame of the device.
Exam Tip
Most often you will deal with grounding the interrogator to a forklift frame.
Objective 7.4
Post-installation Testing
U
pon completion of an installation, you should visually inspect all power
and Ethernet cables and all RF fields, and test the system to ensure that the
tags are read, data transmission is occurring where it should be, and that all ca-
bles are connected properly and performing their functions.Visually inspect the
RF field by introducing tagged items with properly encoded tags into the IZ,and
then watch for the appropriate lights on the reader and data populating the
back-end system. Move the tagged item around the intended coverage area to
ensure that reads occur wherever they should.
You may need to install a status indicator with your portal to indicate when it
is “live”or reading tags so that facility personnel can avoid walking through that
IZ with tagged items that are not supposed to be read. Such rules may indicate
the need for a change in operational parameters for that facility.
Once the system is fully installed, you should officially commission the sys-
tem by giving the client a demonstration of its abilities with tagged goods as they
are processed through the facility. Once the customer is satisfied with the com-
pletion of the installation,obtain a signature of an authorized person indicating
acceptance of the installation.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 7.1: Preinstallation
Prior to installation, you should determine
whether you have proper equipment and safety devices ready for the instal-
lation. Make sure that the RFID equipment functions properly in accor-
dance with the manufacturers’ specifications and will function as desired if
installed in locations the way it is designed by a system architect. Check

CHAPTER 7 Installation
199
whether the appropriate cables and wiring are installed in the right places
(and that they comply with industry standards).Ensure that adequate space is
afforded to run the equipment and that the power line is properly grounded.
✔Objective 7.2: Hardware Installation
All static hardware must be properly
secured by adequate mounts, and grounded and protected from external dam-
age caused by personnel, vehicles, or environmental conditions (using special
stands,bollards,and NEMA enclosures).Hardware must have enough space for
access to connections and cabling as well as for ventilation.If you cannot ensure
that the equipment will be used in a dry, stable environment, you should use
protectiveNEMAenclosures.Mobileequipmentmustbeconnectedproperlyto
achieve the desired mobility.When you are installing any electronic equipment,
first connect all additional devices to it before powering it.
✔Objective 7.3: Grounding Considerations
Three types of grounds are used:
power line ground, local ground, and RF ground. When these grounds are
different, potential ground loops can develop. All components in an RFID
system should be grounded to a common ground. Use surge protectors or
uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) for the equipment. The equipment
mounted on material handling devices such as conveyor or other stationary
devices as well as a vehicle such as a forklift should be grounded to the frame
of the device. In areas prone to lightning, install lightning protectors.
✔Objective 7.4: Post-installation Testing
Post-installation, visually inspect
all power and Ethernet cables,visually inspect all RF fields,and test the system
to ensure that the tags are read,data transmission is occurring where it should
be, and all cables are connected properly and performing their functions.

The methods used for testing and troubleshooting a failed RFID installation are
similar to those used when troubleshooting classic IT systems. You always start
with the easiest data points to verify at the physical device, and then you work
your way out to the more complex connections to back-end systems.
Objective 8.1
General Troubleshooting
Process
W
hen starting the troubleshooting process,you must clearly define the fail-
ure before you do anything else.This will provide the starting and ending
points for this process. Once you understand the problem as interpreted by the
user, you can work to resolve that specific issue.
Remember that getting the system running and finding the source of the fail-
ure are usually two very different things. Ensure that you have identified the ac-
tual source of the trouble so that you can devise a way to prevent this problem
from occurring again in the future. This is called root cause analysis, and it’s of-
ten forgotten once the system is running again. When this crucial step is missed,
further problems can arise from the problem you thought you solved.
Follow these steps when troubleshooting:
1. Reboot the system. Before you begin any troubleshooting, reboot the
equipment in the interrogation zone (IZ). This simple step will often
resolve issues brought on by power surges or incomplete commands
issued by the back-end system.
Exam Tip
Remember that rebooting is often the easiest way to fix the problem
and should be one of the first steps in the troubleshooting process.
2. Start with easy stuff. Always begin your investigation by looking at
issues that are easily discovered and verified. Check power connections
at the reader as well as at the source, including any power converters or
conditioners. Check cables for damage in the cables themselves or at

CHAPTER 8 Testing and Troubleshooting
205
the connector, because excessive bending or other signs of possible
cable wear might lead to signal degradation and/or signal interference.
Check all physical connectors to see that they are all properly seated in
their sockets (don’t forget antenna connectors and I/O connectors),
and be sure to look at the power indication lights on all the equipment.
This step may seem obvious, but many hours of troubleshooting have
been wasted only to discover a blown power supply or a disconnected
power cord.
3. Check whether and where the tags are seen. Once you have verified
that power is running to all devices and components, test to see what
happens when tags are present in the read area. Most interrogators have
several indicator lights that show not only the reader status but also
whether the tags have been recognized and interpreted. If complex
triggering devices are installed within the IZ, you can disconnect the
interrogator from all other devices, connect to it with your laptop, and
then perform this test using the manufacturer’s software provided with
the interrogator. If you see the tags, you know the interrogator is not
the source of the issue; if you don’t see the tags, look closely at the
antenna connections and cables, interrogator configuration, and
finally the interrogator itself for possible replacement.
Travel Advisory
When replacing hardware, make sure that you turn off the whole system and
disconnect the power running to a device. Never disconnect an antenna from
an interrogator when it is in use—even if the antenna is not in use but the
interrogator is turned on. When you are installing a new device as a
replacement, follow the same rules. Make sure that you connect
the devices to the power as the last step after you secure all other
connections (antennas, network, I/Os, and so on).
4. Test all triggering and feedback devices. If the tag was successfully
read when you manually triggered the interrogation through the
manufacturer’s software but it is not triggered (or at least you cannot
see any indication if it is) when the tagged product goes through the
IZ, you need to check your triggering and feedback devices. Are the
light break sensors properly aligned, connected, and configured? Is the

206
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
reader set up for polling for tags after being triggered by an external
device? Are the presence detectors lighting the appropriate lights when
materials are in the interrogation area? Does the light stack show any
lights at all? If the equipment acts like it is functional, but no indicator
lights are lit, check for appropriate power and connections and verify
whether the light bulbs are functional or need to be replaced.
5. Check network communications. Once all the local devices belonging
to the IZ have been verified, look at network connections to and
from the zone. Connect a PC to the network on which the interrogator
is connected. Ping the interrogator (see the following “Travel Assistance”).
If you get a response, you can rule out connectivity and network
configuration issues. If you do not get a response, you can check the
network configuration for appropriate settings of the IP address,
subnet mask, and gateway. You should also perform this test for any
network connected devices such as Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) instead of path loss contour devices.
Travel Assistance
How do you ping a reader? If you have a computer networking background, you
know how to do this, but here’s a brief description for the rest of us. Open a
command prompt in your computer: choose Start | Run, and then type cmd and
press ENTER. A window opens, where you will see a path to your current location.
Type in the following: ping 192.168.xyz.xyz (the xyz number is the IP address
of your reader—don’t enter xyz.xyz!) and press ENTER. If you do not know the
reader’s IP address, you can find it through the hyperterminal via a serial
connection or through your network router interface. If you get a reply
to the ping, this indicates that your reader is communicating over the
network. If you see “Request timed out,” you will have to
troubleshoot the network settings and connections.
6. Check middleware. If all the local devices can communicate across the
network properly but your reads are not registering in your back-end
systems, you need to look at the other end of these connections. If a
middleware client is placed behind these readers, make sure that it is
running. Just as you did with the IZ equipment, reboot it! A full server
reboot may not be feasible, but you can certainly restart the service

CHAPTER 8 Testing and Troubleshooting
207
controlling this package to ensure that no corrupt data has interrupted
it. If this resolves the problem, be sure to check the log files to see what
the last event prior to the failure was so you can perform root cause
analysis.
7. Check enterprise resource planning (ERP), warehouse management
systems (WMS), and Transaction Processing (TP) systems connections.
After you have tested the middleware and verified that it functions
as it should, check the connections to the back-end system to ensure
that they are functional. Typically, installed systems will have a status
monitor that indicates failure should one exist. Sometimes you can
run a test script that will emulate data coming from the reader to
ensure that the back-end system shows the proper results. If you
encounter problems, restart the service (reboot) and see if the problem
persists. As before, always check the logs to find the last event prior to
failure to perform root cause analysis.
After completing these steps, most problems should be resolved.
Exam Tip
Be aware that if the RFID equipment follows the RF emission regulations,
the damage it can cause to a human body during operation and handling
is not likely to be due to radiation but rather due to electric shock.

Troubleshooting
F
ollowing are common problems that you might encounter during system
deployment. Most problems will be generated by improper hardware and
software setup in the IZs or by improperly tagged products. Damage to hard-
ware as well as tags themselves are also often causes for failures. Let’s look at
some specific problem examples and troubleshooting techniques that will help
you resolve these potential situations.

208
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
An infinite number of problems can be generated by a failure or improper
setup of the IZ. Following are some of the most common problems that you
need to check and information about how to troubleshoot the problem.
No Reads
The IZ doesn’t show any reads although tagged product is going through the IZ.
What questions should you ask?
•
Are all the components powered on? You should see various status lights
blinking or turned on. Check the interrogator lights, lights on the
power supply, and lights on the peripherals. If any of these lights
are not illuminated when they should be, check to ensure that the
connections are secure and check the condition of the cables. Make
sure everything is tight and properly secured, that cables are not bent
more than they should be, and that the connectors are not damaged.
•
Is the reader configured properly? Prior to the reader being able to read
tags, several settings must be correctly configured according to the
manufacturer and type of the reader. Check the following:
•
Is the world region set? Some readers will not read tags until you
set them up for the appropriate world region and country of
operation. These settings concern various performance restrictions
around the world.
•
Is polling enabled? Make sure that polling is enabled and set up for
certain time intervals, continuous polling, or waiting for a trigger
from an I/O device according to your needs. The default setting
may prevent the reader from polling (reading) for tags.
•
Are the correct tag protocols defined? Is the reader set up for
Electronic Product Code (EPC) Class 0 and Class 1, and do you
need to read Gen 2 tags? Or is the opposite required? Is your reader
set up for reading EPC tags, while you are running International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) tags through your IZ?
Make sure that you set up your reader for the appropriate protocol.
Try to avoid choosing support for all protocols because that would
slow down your read rates. Use this only if you are truly reading all
of the reader’s supported protocols in your operation.

CHAPTER 8 Testing and Troubleshooting
209
•
Are the antennas defined correctly in the reader? Most readers
usually automatically recognize which antennas are connected
and automatically enable them. However, if your reader drives the
antennas for two or more IZs, verify that the appropriate antennas
for that particular zone are enabled and set with correct output
power settings.
•
Is the read/write function of the reader set? Some readers can be set
for read only, write only, or both, so make sure that the appropriate
function is not disabled.
•
Is the network configuration set up correctly? Your reader may read
tags but, due to improper network configuration, you are not
seeing the reads in your middleware or back-end system. Make sure
that the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is turned
off or on, depending on the network. If you are not using DHCP,
you must use the appropriate IP address to communicate with the
reader. If you are using DHCP, the IP address will be dynamically
assigned to the device by the network.
•
Is the antenna orientation correct? If using linear antennas and single
dipole tags, ensure that the tags are parallel to the antennas.
•
Can the antenna beam reach the tag? Make sure that you have
correct power settings for the antenna to ensure appropriate RF
coverage of the IZ.
•
Can the tag be seen from all positions on the product? With dense or
RF-difficult products, you may need to angle the antenna or add
additional antennas to ensure sufficient coverage of the IZ and the
product to achieve reads. Your tags might have been on the bottom
of an RF-opaque product, for example, so antennas reading from
the top couldn’t reach the product.
Less Reads than Tags
The amount of tags passing through the IZ doesn’t match amount of tags read
(but tags are functioning).If the amount of tags read is smaller than the amount
of tags traversing the IZ, consider the following questions:
•
Is the expectation of reading all tags in the zone realistic? The answer
may depend on the type of product, amount of tags, speed the tags

210
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
are moving through the zone, as well as the IZ configuration such as
number of antennas and reading settings.
A full pallet of goods may not always read at 100 percent. This happens
often with dense or RF-difficult products such as cans or metallic
components. Additional antennas aiming from the top of the pallet
may provide additional reads, as may pallet rotation. Alternatively, you
can compare the case tags with the pallet tag, and if the product stretch
wrap is untouched or the case count is confirmed, you can handle the
pallet as 100-percent read.
•
Are too many tag protocols enabled? Too many protocols enabled will
slow down the reader because it has to check the tag for every protocol
until it finds the right one with which to communicate successfully.
This can cause missed tags, so you should enable only the protocols
required for the operation.
•
Are the goods in view of the antenna for a long enough period of time? If
many tags are moving quickly through the IZ, the reader may not be
able to read them all. This can be caused by a number of protocol
issues already discussed, or it could be caused by other processes, such
as anti-collision or dense reader mode. The solution is to increase the
tag’s dwell time by angling the antennas into the tag’s path of travel. It
may be necessary to place more antennas along the path to increase IZ
coverage.
•
Are potential sources of interference located around the IZ? Interference
can cause missed reads. Check for wireless communication systems
and wireless networks as well as metal objects in the area that can cause
signal reflections and multipath interference.
More Reads than Tags
If the number of tags read is larger than the amount of actual tags passing
through the IZ, ask the following questions:
•
Does the data format of the additional tag reads match data encoded to
other tags? If the answer is yes, you are probably experiencing stray
reads. These reads occur when a product is passing by the IZ and due
to improper power setting or reflections in the IZ, the antenna registers
the tag although it shouldn’t. Similar situations can occur if the power

CHAPTER 8 Testing and Troubleshooting
211
settings at the adjacent IZs such as dock door portals or conveyor
portals are too high and the antenna beams are overlapping to adjacent
IZs. To solve this problem, you should lower the power settings, tilt the
antennas away from the passing object or use antennas with smaller
gain, or use shielding between each IZ.
•
Is the data format inconsistent with any other data formats used on
your tags? Does the data look totally “nonsensical”? You may have
experienced a ghost read. Ghost reads are caused by RF noise in the
environment that the interrogator can sometimes interpret as a tag
data. Although the Gen 2 protocol has a technique for decreasing the
ghost reads by format verification, ghost reads may still appear from
time to time.
Objective 8.3
Tag Failure
Troubleshooting
T
ag failure can be one of the most difficult problems to troubleshoot in an
installed system. Tags fail for many reasons, such as improper application
speed, improper application pressure, electrostatic discharge (ESD), tag abuse,
incorrect tag programming, and poor tag quality. Following is a discussion of a
few of these scenarios and suggestions of things to check to isolate the source of
the problem.
Tag Not Recognized
Tags are being read but not recognized by the inventory system. Ask the fol-
lowing:
•
Is the format of the tag data expected by the system? A 64-bit value
assigned to a 96-bit memory space for an EPC value will give the
appearance of a corrupt tag. Reader output parameters should be
checked to ensure the format of the messages they send is what is
expected by the data processing system.

212
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Travel Assistance
EPC Generation 1 tags used to support a 64-bit EPC number, but Gen 2
uses 96-bit EPC and supports up to a 256-bit EPC number that may
be used in the future.
•
Does some data on the tag appear to be invalid? This tag may have slipped
through the encoding procedure. Manufacturers place test data on the
tags to validate their operational capacity prior to shipment, and this
may be the data you are seeing if a tag slipped through your process
unencoded. There is also the possibility that a certain part of the EPC
number is incorrectly encoded or corrupted. For instance, if there is a
corrupted EPC header, the data read from the tag will not make any sense.
Conveyor Reading
On a conveyor, the amount of tags moving through the IZ doesn’t match the
amount of tags read. Ask the following:
•
Are the tags placed properly on the objects to which they are attached?
Tags may have fallen off the product. You must also ensure that the
tags are in the proper place. The product was tested for the best tag
placement, so compare the best tag location with the actual tag
location. If the tag is placed in a location that is not ideal, it may
get detuned and missed during interrogation.
•
Are these quiet or damaged tags? Depending on the testing and
verification procedures, the product could have been tagged with a
quiet or damaged tag. A tag could have also been damaged during its
application, or during its life by the conveyor, other products, forklifts,
or other means.
Tags are often damaged by ESD, which can result from accumulation
of static charges. Static charges build up in environments with very low
humidity; around various types of plastics, carpets, and other static
susceptible materials; and by traction. Static charges are created by
peeling off the label from the backing, walking on a carpet, traction
of conveyor belt bearings, stretch wrapping, and many other activities.
To protect the tags from ESD, you should store them in ESD-protective

bags (conductive bags) and take other ESD protection and avoidance
measures as discussed in previous chapters.
Tags can be also be damaged by extreme temperatures. Tags on a roll
have a lower storage temperature than tag operational temperatures.
When tags are on a roll, increased temperature will increase the
pressure on the tags as the roll tries to expand. This can cause broken
connections between the ICs and the tag antennas. You should follow
manufacturer’s guidelines regarding storage temperature and tag
operating temperature, which is on average from about –20 to 70
degrees C (–4 to 158 degrees F).
You must determine whether the damage to tags occurs at a common
place and how it occurs and possibly try to eliminate this point or add
a step for exception processing.
•
Is the tag oriented properly to the antenna? As mentioned earlier, if the
IZ uses a linear antenna and the tags are single dipole, you must ensure
that they stay in proper orientation while traversing the IZ. At some
point in the process, the tagged cases may get flipped or turned
around, and that could cause the changed orientation. You may need
to eliminate this issue or implement circular antennas to ensure the
reads regardless of the tag orientation. Sometimes the orientation issue
doesn’t lie within the horizontal or vertical orientation but with the
angle toward the antenna. If the tags are placed at a 90-degree angle to
the antenna, they are quite unlikely to be read (depending on the type
of tag and the RF propagation in the area). Combining more antennas
and possibly tilting them in various directions can help solve this
problem.
•
Has the tag been properly selected for this product? This problem can
occur mainly if you are using the same tags for a wide range of
products. If the product is only cereal, for example, the best
performance is probable along with 100 percent reads. But if you
are using the same tag for tagging and shipping cans of food, many
reflections and detuning will occur, which will result in a much lower
read percentage. You often cannot change the tag selection, but you
can at least revise the tag placement or increase the performance by
adding an insulating or air gap creating layer to reduce or eliminate
detuning.

Hardware and Software
Troubleshooting
W
e’ve discussed what to check and how to determine causes of problems
with a device as well as what to do if performance is worse than ex-
pected.These problems are usually caused by improper configuration.Now let’s
look at hardware and software issues that may cause less than ideal performance
of the device.
Firmware Upgrades
Known software issues within the hardware can often be addressed through
firmware upgrades from the manufacturer. However, these updates should be
applied only if they address a specific need. Every firmware update for RFID in-
terrogators, RFID printers, or any other device will include a text file that de-
scribes the issues it specifically addresses. Manufacturers use these upgrades to
fix problems identified in units after they have been released.
Firmware updates can also be used to increase the functionality of compo-
nents. For instance, many readers and printers could be firmware upgraded to
support Gen 2 tags.In case the firmware introduces a new feature or support for
a new technology standard that you will be using, an upgrade will save you
money and time you would spend obtaining new devices.
It is always a good idea and best practice to make sure that all similar devices
are running on the same version of firmware. This can help ensure consistency,
both in performance and in maintenance. Different versions of firmware may
cause discrepancies in how various readers perform, even if they are the same
model. As new firmware is released, it may cause the reader to run faster due to
enhancements,for example.To obtain uniform performance,test a firmware on
a sample reader to see that it works as expected, and then deploy it to all readers
of that type.
When building a maintenance plan for your equipment, you should always
have a documented procedure to load the specific firmware your company uses
on the device before deploying or replacing it. This way, all of the options in
your configuration are sure to be available, and all the features you need are
where your technicians expect them based on the documentation.

Be careful not to load a version of firmware simply because it is the latest
available. The rule here is “very old and very simple.” Or, “If it isn’t broken,
don’t fix it!”If you decide to try out new firmware, always test it on an isolated
device designated for testing to ensure that it is not going to cause problems.
Subtle changes in an upgrade can wreak havoc on an implementation if the
upgrade is not implemented properly. For instance, command sets could
change between versions, rendering installed communications useless and re-
quiring extensive re-engineering of software components. For these reasons,
always test new versions thoroughly in every use scenario in the company
(dock door configurations, conveyor configurations, and so on) before con-
sidering full-scale rollout.
Network
Network communication problems can dramatically impact the performance
of an installed RFID system. If you recorded a baseline of performance during
installation,you’ll find it beneficial to check to baseline to determine the average
response time then. Comparing the original response time to the current situa-
tion may indicate the network is experiencing higher network traffic, causing a
slow response from the RFID installation.
Software
When all of the physical devices and the network have been verified and are
working, proceed to checking the software. Most middleware platforms include
some sort of status monitor that can be used to verify at a glance that the pro-
gram is functional. Sometimes a test script is included to allow you to input a
known data stream and expect a fixed value to be output. If the script produces
the expected value, the problem may be somewhere else. You should investigate
the connection from the middleware to the legacy application.
All software can be restarted (like step one with hardware) by rebooting it.
When a service appears to be locked up or not responding to regular input, re-
starting it is the first step. If this does not resolve the issue, check the error logs
for a logged failure. Even a recent administrator password change can cause is-
sues for services and will appear as such in the error logs.
Certain errors can be also cleared by restoring the reader’s default settings.
Some readers have a safe mode that does not allow reading tags or other regular
operations but restores default settings and tests various reader functions.

CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 8.1: General Troubleshooting Process
When troubleshooting
the IZ, follow these steps:
1. Reboot the equipment in the IZ.
2. Check power connections including any power converters or
conditioners, antennas, and network and I/O connections.
3. Check if and where the tags are seen. If tags are not seen, check
antenna connections and cables, interrogator configuration, and
the interrogator.
4. Test all triggering and feedback devices.
5. Check network communications and proper network configuration.
6. Check middleware if all the local devices can communicate across the
network properly but your reads are not registering in your back-end
systems.
7. Check ERP, WMS, and TP systems connections.
✔Objective 8.2: Interrogation Zone Troubleshooting
When an IZ doesn’t
show any reads when a tagged product is passing through, the failure may be
caused by a disconnected power source, improper reader configuration (a
world region, enabled polling, enabled read/write, correct air interface and
data protocols, network information), antennas incorrectly defined in the
reader,improper antenna configuration,or improper tag orientation related
to an antenna.
If the amount of tags read is smaller than the amount of tags traversing
the IZ, this could be caused by too many protocols enabled (which leads to
lower read rates), short tag dwell time, interference, improper tagging, or in-
correct tag types for the given product.
If the amount of tags read is larger than the amount of actual tags passing
through the read zone, you are experiencing stray reads from tags near the
IZ.If the data format of the additional tag read does not match data encoded
to other tags, the phenomenon is called ghost reads.

✔Objective 8.3: Tag Failure Troubleshooting
When the amount of tags
passing through the IZ is higher than amount of tags read, it could be
caused by improperly tagged items. The product should be tested for the
best tag placement, so you need to compare the best tag location with the
actual tag location. If the tag is placed into a less-than-ideal location (for
instance, touching a RF-difficult product such as metallic or aqueous
items), it may get detuned and missed during interrogation or torn off
during its move through the supply chain. Other problems can be caused
by using improper types of tags for a product. Proper tags should with-
stand the environmental conditions and handling to which the product is
exposed. In addition, you should use a tag that is tuned to operate opti-
mally when placed on certain materials (such as tags specifically made for
metal, glass, or other materials).
✔Objective 8.4: Hardware and Software Troubleshooting
To determine why
the hardware is not functioning properly or doesn’t work at all, you must
check following things:
•
Power connections at the reader as well as at the source, including any
power converters or conditioners.
•
All cables for proper connectivity or damage on the cable or at the
connector, excessive bending, or other signs of possible corruption.
•
Proper function of triggering and feedback devices. The reader may
be set up for polling for tags after being triggered by an external device,
but if the device doesn’t function, the reader doesn’t get the trigger.
•
The lights on the devices and light stacks. If the equipment acts like
it is functional, but no lights are lit, check for appropriate power and
connections and also verify whether the light bulbs are functional or
they need to be replaced.
•
Network connectivity. Connect a PC to the network on which the
device is connected. Ping the device. If you get a response, you can
rule out connectivity and network configuration issues. If you do
not get any response, you should check the network configuration.
•
Firmware updates can be used to fix software issues in the hardware,
increase the functionality of components, and provide support for new
features (such as support for Gen 2 tags).

REVIEW ANSWERS
1.
In a shampoo packaging facility, where shampoo bottles are
packaged into cardboard boxes that are tagged by an automated printer
applicator, some of the boxes are arriving to the palletizer without
labels. The best way to correct this problem is to install an IZ
downstream from the printer applicator to verify the labels and
route the untagged boxes to exception processing.
2.
If the company wants to read the Gen 2 tags, it should first try to
upgrade the interrogator firmware to support Gen 2. This option is
supported by most of the interrogators on the market; however, if the
upgrade is not possible, the purchase of new interrogators will be
necessary.
3.
To start troubleshooting this problem, the RFID technician should
first check the antenna cable and make sure it is connected properly. It
may have been disconnected accidentally or on purpose by personnel.
The interrogator has to be powered, since the other two antennas are
220
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

reading, and antenna 3 has to be set up properly because it was
working earlier; therefore, A, B, and C are incorrect.
4.
The most likely cause of these misreads is the condensation on the
tags, which can reduce the tag read range. Tags applied to frozen food
or food intended for freezing are specifically designed for this purpose
and are able to survive low ambient temperatures.
5.
The failures are most likely caused by the ESD generated by the
plastic containers, which damages the inlays. The ESD on the plastic
containers can be generated by traction of the containers on the
conveyor or when being handled during their transport.
6.
To be protected from ESD, smart labels should be stored in
conductive bags.
7.
When the tag ID numbers do not match the format or value of
any currently encoded numbers, the problem is most likely a ghost
read.
8.
The first step to take when troubleshooting this situation should
be to reboot the interrogator, which often fixes the problem.
9.
When the interrogators at some dock doors are reading tags
passing through adjacent dock doors, you should adjust power settings
at the interrogators that read tags at adjacent dock doors and install
shielding material between adjacent dock doors.
10.
When a newly installed interrogator is generating constant errors
while attempting to encode tags, the interrogator configuration
parameters are not set to match the tag parameters. For instance, the
air interface or data protocol does not match.

This chapter discusses the site survey, the planning that goes into the site survey,
and various elements that you need to examine when performing the site analy-
sis,including anomalies for the site.It also provides guidance regarding generat-
ing the site survey report.
When performing a site analysis,keep in mind where and how you will install
the interrogation zones (IZs). Because each facility has unique characteristics,
your considerations for every IZ will vary. You’ll encounter differences in each
site’s workflow; differences in how personnel, material, assets, and other objects
move about the site; and differences in the items you track between one site and
the next, even if the sites are within the same implementation project or within
the same enterprise-wide implementation across multiple facilities.
During the site analysis, you will gather all the information you need for de-
sign and deployment of the RFID system. It is critical that you get information
for all the systems with which you will be interfacing for your implementation.
So,for example,if you are going to connect to a warehouse management system,
collect every piece of documentation you can about it. If you can get the phone
numbers of the people who installed this system, document them in case you
need more information. You must also obtain the contact information for the
individuals who are responsible for the back-end system with which you will be
integrating the RFID system. Typically, sites that are ISO 9000 certified have
standard operating procedures already documented. You need to familiarize
yourself with these procedures and collect information about how problems are
handled; for instance, when machinery breaks, what is the contingency plan?
For those sites that are not ISO 9000 compliant,you’ll need to develop your own
documentation.
Once you understand the characteristics of the site and its environment,in-
cluding the RF characteristics, the business processes, and the flow of the
products, you can predict the performance of the RFID solutions you plan to
deploy.
Objective 9.1

Assessment
B
efore you start working on RF site characteristics (usually the focus of most
people who try to sell spectrum analyzers or expensive consulting hours),
you must consider the environmental characteristics as well as the infrastruc-
224
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

ture of the site. These characteristics can “make or break” your system imple-
mentation.
Environmental Characteristics
Understand the environmental conditions of the site, because your system
must be designed not only to survive but also to perform optimally in these
conditions. You should be aware of such conditions as temperature extremes,
levels of humidity, and possibility of water intrusion, electrical shock, and vi-
bration.
Temperature Considerations
Consider the following: Is the installation in a temperature-controlled facility?
To what temperatures are the equipment exposed during its operation? If the
system will be deployed outside—for instance, in a shipping yard—electronics
may be required to withstand temperatures anywhere from 25 to 45 degrees (F)
higher than the ambient temperature at the site. This might not be a problem in
an air-conditioned facility, but it can be troublesome during summer if the fa-
cility is not temperature-controlled, because you may exceed the maximum op-
erating temperature recommended by the equipment manufacturer. Be aware
that if the maximum operating temperature for your equipment is up to 140 de-
grees, with the ambient temperature reaching 110 or 115 degrees, the insides of
the cases containing the electronics can reach 140 degrees or more. Computers
and computer-related equipment are very sensitive to extreme temperatures
and will start degrading performance or shut down as they overheat. If your
equipment is often overheated, the hardware’s overall lifespan will decrease and
problems with reliability can come to the fore.
Humidity, Dust, and Chemicals
You must consider the types of operations that take place in the facility. Is this a
“clean” facility, such as research facility, laboratory, hospital, or electronics as-
sembly plant? In this case,consider your presence during the deployment as well
as how your equipment will affect this environment once installed and opera-
tional.If this is a “dirty”facility,you’ll look at factors that may affect your equip-
ment after it is installed, such as the levels of humidity experienced in the
facility,chemicals that are used in the process,or the potential for large amounts
of industrial dust. (For instance, in a paper manufacturing plant, you will en-
counter large amounts of paper dust.) If your equipment has open vents and
fans, the dust will be sucked into the heat sinks of the electronics, so you might
have to add filters to the fans to reduce some of that dust prior to its invading the
equipment.

MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Exam Tip
Know that you may need to mount some of your equipment in uniform enclosures
(for instance, NEMA enclosures) to protect it from the environment to
keep out water, humidity, and dirt, but you may also use temperature-
controlled or explosion-proof enclosures.
Local Lingo
Dirty facility
A dirty facility may be not only physically dirty—full of dust,
lint, or chemicals—but can also be dirty as related to RF signals. A facility in
which many RF-emitting devices operate can have high levels of RF noise
and interference, which provides difficult conditions for RFID
implementations.
You should examine the facility environment not only because of the possible
damage that it could cause to your equipment, but also to make sure that the
RFID system installers will be ready to work in such space. How you mount the
equipment is just as important as the equipment you select for these sites. Of
course, the facility type will determine the equipment you bring with you and the
clothing and breathing protection equipment you wear. (You won’t wear your
Hugo Boss suit during a site survey or installation at a warehouse, because you’ll
undoubtedly be crawling around dusty conveyors and walk around the dirty facil-
ity. On the other hand, if you’re doing a site survey or implementation in a hospi-
tal, you won’t want to wear steel-toe boots, an old T-shirt, and sturdy jeans.)
Vibrations
Make sure that you identify all sources of vibration that will affect your equip-
ment. Obviously, if your RFID equipment will be mounted on mobile assets, it
will experience vibration. If you are attaching an RFID interrogator to a forklift,
for instance,you know that it will have to withstand the vibrations as the forklift
rolls across the floor.
Some causes of vibrations might not be immediately obvious.Check for con-
veyors, manufacturing lines, and heavy machinery inside the facility, as well as
rail lines, highways, or airports outside the facility in the near proximity. In
some manufacturing facilities, rail lines literally run through them so that the
cars can stop and be loaded or unloaded inside the operation. A seismographic
analysis may be needed to demonstrate this, as shown next.

CHAPTER 9 Site Analysis
227
Facility Infrastructure
After you have documented the environmental conditions, you will need to ex-
amine the infrastructure of the facility or space where your system will be de-
ployed. First, you should try to get a copy of the building plans or blueprints.
Other useful documents can be network cabling diagrams, HVAC system dia-
grams, electrical diagrams, and so on.

228
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
Sometimes these diagrams may not be available or accessible; you can use
any facility plan or drawing that was originally designed for evacuation pur-
poses instead. Once you get the building plans, you can start to mark informa-
tion on the plans to correlate the facts that will drive decisions about where your
IZs will be located and how they will look.
Location and Movement
of Equipment and People
You should document all equipment and machinery used,including the models
and possibly descriptions if they are customized for that particular building or
operation. Examine equipment such as fork trucks, pallet jacks, and other vehi-
cles that will be traveling through or near the interrogation zones. You must
capture how vehicles, equipment, and personnel move about the location as
part of the normal business process/operation.You should note the paths for ve-
hicles, products, and personnel in your building plan. This will help you deter-
mine the placement of IZs and their protection, and it will help you avoid
blocking paths and access/exit routes for vehicles and personnel.
Building Details
You must take notes about the structure and size of the building and what mate-
rials are used in the construction of the floors, walls, and roof. Measure the dis-
tances between dock doors and accurately mark the location of stationary
objects that you will not be able to remove to accommodate IZs.You should also
identify the location of the back-end processing computer that will be sending
and receiving data to and from your RFID system. You must determine how
data will move to and from that computer,which means identifying cabling and
network requirements.
Travel Advisory
Let’s talk a bit about cable length. Being 400 feet from the nearest wiring closet
may not mean anything to you, but a professional network installer (or a person
who has installed a network a couple of times) will know that the limit for copper
wire is 328 feet. Therefore, you can’t run a network wire that far and get your
signal to and from the reader without a repeater in line. So, if the reader needs
to be 400 feet from the wiring closet, plan to spend another $100
or so in your budget for a repeater. If you don’t do this, your IZ
might not be able to communicate with your back-end system.

CHAPTER 9 Site Analysis
229
If you’re working on a multistory implementation, find out what is above
and below the site where you are installing the system, and determine whether
RFID systems on multiple floors need to be considered. You need to watch for
potential sources of interference—consider whether you are installing an
RFID system for asset management or a 2.4 GHz active real time location sys-
tem (RTLS). On the floor below, for example, may be a company that manu-
factures wireless networking equipment, which happens to operate at 2.4
GHz,and this could cause interference.Look for anything that might affect the
frequency you select for your system.You can acquire RTLS systems that run at
other frequencies. Or it might be appropriate to select a different approach to
avoid a potential source of interference if you can’t remove it altogether.
Equipment such as large machines and large motors can cause interference
with RFID systems as well. You should know where that equipment is located
relative to your IZs and where and when you can expect interference. (For
more on this, see “RF Characteristics.”)
Document the location of entry and exit doors, dock doors, and any “pinch
points”for material moving throughout the facility.Note locations of the power
outlets, which will help you determine whether new power lines are required or
you can take advantage of existing power outlets.
Also note the location of access points, hubs, routers, switches, bridges, and
any network equipment for LAN or wireless networks, including the coverage
area of those networks and their security protocols. When you are selecting
equipment, you should try to match the networking characteristics. If you are
implementing equipment that will use an existing wireless network, make sure
that it meets the security standards so that it functions properly on that net-
work.
Mark the locations of stationary heavy machinery and conveyor belts, and
mark the locations and dimensions of any restricted zones around machines.
Document the policies about working or not working with a particular ma-
chine or device while it is running. In addition, look at equipment emissions,
such as heat, steam, or any leaking chemicals that may affect the environment
and your RFID equipment. Many machines, as well as heavy-duty cabinets
and shelving, are made of metal, which can cause reflections or block the RF
waves altogether.
Document materials in which the building, equipment, machinery, and
products are made. This is especially important for materials that are not
RF-friendly. RF friendliness will depend on proposed frequency of your system.
(For more on RF-friendly materials, see Chapter 2.)

Planning the IZs
When you are performing a site analysis, you are also trying to determine where
to place IZs, interrogators, printers, and antennas. You must also consider the
flow of the goods; the antennas must be positioned near the goods to be tracked,
yet out of harm’s way. Knowing that when you are reading tags on assets, prod-
ucts, or people as they go through the zone, you want the antennas facing the
zone, facing those products, facing those people, but still out of harm’s way as
much as possible.
If the facility has a large dock door,vehicles may carry tall pallets stacks,and a
tall IZ with perhaps additional antennas will be required to cover the entire
space. If slow-moving objects are being tracked, you could limit the number of
antennas used, especially if you know that the tags are always going to be on one
side, and the pallets always move the same way through the IZ (on a pallet con-
veyor, for example). For low-speed applications, only a couple of antennas may
be required to get the job done as opposed to high-speed applications that need
multiple antennas along the travel path to increase tag dwell time.
Objective 9.2
RF Characteristics
C
onducting an RF site analysis in the facility may be required depending
on the overall scope of the implementation. If you are implementing a
simple “slap and ship” operation, you will not usually need to perform an RF
site survey. However, if you are performing a multi-dock door and conveyor
integration, an analysis of the environment from the RF perspective may save
time and money because you will understand potential for interference. The
analysis will also help you devise a strategy on how to avoid or overcome this
interference.
If you are not experienced in performing RF site surveys, you should hire a
specialized company to conduct the analysis, such as a local wireless network
company. You do not need to survey the whole facility; you may target just the
areas of IZs and potential interference.
In a full-blown implementation,sources of interference need to be identified
with a spectrum analyzer, which will measure across a broad frequency range
looking for what RF activities are already present at the site. Typically, you
should examine a relatively wide band around the frequency you will be using

CHAPTER 9 Site Analysis
231
for your system. If, for example, you are performing a site survey specific to 915
MHz,you will set your spectrum analyzer from 400 MHz to 1.5 GHz to measure
all RF activity in the range.
You should also look for harmonic signals, which can cause problems with
your system. In a European installation with a 433 MHz active tag RTLS and a
passive system running between 865 and 868 MHz, for example, you should be
aware that these signals could cause problems. 866 MHz is exactly double the
433 MHz value and is therefore the first-order harmonic, which could cause in-
terference. Knowing this can save you a lot of headaches should problems arise
in the future.
Local Lingo
Harmonics
Harmonics occur when two wavelengths intersect. If one
wavelength is exactly double the length of another, they can intersect
and cause a null within the read zone.
How to Use a Spectrum Analyzer
Once a potential frequency interferer has been identified on the spectrum
analyzer, it’s pretty simple to identify the source of that frequency. Move 10
feet in any direction and note whether the signal gets stronger or weaker. If
it gets stronger, continue to move in that same direction until the signal is at
its strongest; then look in the immediate proximity for the source of that inter-
ference.
Dealing with Interference
If you find a potential source of interference,you will have to find a way to shield
against it or you may have to replace it. If the problem is caused by two-way ra-
dios, for example, the solution may be easy: replace them with communication
devices operating in a different frequency range. On the other hand, if the inter-
ference is caused by a manufacturing execution system, such as a crane and that
can cost a couple million dollars, replacement may not be an option. For situa-
tions in which you cannot avoid interference for other reasons,you can consider
shielding.
Some sources of interference can be conveyor belts, large motors running at
480 volts, electric motors on forklifts, electric power jacks, any kind of heavy ma-
chinery, and air-conditioning units. All of these devices can cause substantial
interference to your low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) systems. Other
objects may prove to be unexpected sources of interference. In one particular

facility, for example, forklift operators honked their horns when they approached
an intersection.When an operator honked the horn,it created a harmonic exactly
in the 915 MHz band, causing interference with the UHF RFID system. The solu-
tion in this case was to prohibit use of horns in that immediate area or replace the
horns with others that generated higher or lower tones.
Travel Advisory
Don’t forget about harmonics created by active 433 MHz systems,
which can interfere with UHF systems in Europe, which operate at
865 to 868 MHz.
When you are performing a site survey, ask the IT staff questions regarding
any devices that could possibly cause interference: What types of two-way com-
munication devices are employed here? What types of pagers are used? If a par-
ticular carrier is used for these devices, get the carrier name and a phone
number to find out more information about the system if needed.
Many types of sudden interference are caused by faulty devices that should
be fixed or replaced. Other sources of interference can be the following:
•
Wireless network (usually operating at 2.45 GHz)
•
Short-range radios
•
Cordless phones (operating at 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz)
•
Microwave ovens
•
LAN equipment
•
Neon lights
•
Public or personnel address systems
Travel Assistance
Here’s a story from a real-world implementation that may inspire you when solving
hard-to-identify interference. In a 915 MHz installation, it was difficult to identify
an interfering device, because the signal would often disappear and appear
independently on running equipment. After a while, an engineer using a
spectrum analyzer measured a large spike in a signal when someone
was being paged through the internal speaker system. This led to the
discovery of the problem: a speaker with a malfunctioning coil created
signals in a frequency that caused a direct interference with the
installed RFID system.

RF Path Loss Contour Analysis
If you run into a problem during installation or troubleshooting, it may be nec-
essary to generate a path loss or RF path loss contour analysis (PLC analysis).
You’ll know that it may be beneficial to perform the RF PLC analysis, for exam-
ple, when you have installed some equipment, and all the indicators say it works
fine but you notice sporadic sources of interference that you cannot identify or
spots where the tags are not read.
The PLC analysis measures RF signals all the way around your active IZ and
provides information about the signal strength in granular detail. You’ll need to
do the following to perform this type of analysis:
1. Grab a spectrum analyzer and a measuring tape.
2. Measure signals in 1-foot increments from the antenna in all
dimensions (straight, right, left, up, and down).
3. Mark the signal presence and, ideally, its strength in all points.
4. You can then generate a map and color code the areas according to
signal strength. You can do this manually or using specialized software.
After you are done with the PLC analysis, you can determine how your signal
propagates and identify where issues in the IZ exist, and you will also discover
the sources of interference that you did not expect. Typically, PLC analysis is
very expensive,as it is a time and labor-intensive process; however,it may pay off
if your system is not performing as it should and you cannot determine the
cause. An example of an RF PLC is shown here:

Difference Between Wi-Fi and RFID Site Analysis
RFID site assessments are not that different from wireless network implementa-
tion site surveys. However, Wi-Fi tries to achieve a result quite different from
that of the RFID implementation. The goal of Wi-Fi implementation is to flood
the entire facility with RF, while the goal of RFID is to flood only a particular
area with a high likelihood of reading tags as they traverse that area (IZ) and
control/contain the RF signals within this zone.
Objective 9.3
Business Process
Documentation
A
n essential part of a site analysis is the business process analysis. To design
an RFID system that will track your material, goods, assets, or personnel
successfully and efficiently, you have to be familiar with the current business
process,how the RFID technology can be integrated into it,or how you will have
to change the business process to achieve the best results.
What to Document
To document all business processes at the site, you need to capture informa-
tion such as how and when material moves, how equipment such as forklifts
and cranes move, how and where raw materials are used during the process
and how they are moved throughout the facility, and what happens with fin-
ished products. For instance, if this is a manufacturing line, is the product
staged there at the facility for shipment or is it shipped in real time as it is man-
ufactured? Or perhaps the products are manufactured and stored in a tempo-
rary warehouse attached to the manufacturing facility and are shipped after
the order is complete. All of these processes depend on the type of facility and
its operations.
You should also document all data about production lines and the machines
used in them. The same machines can be used to manufacture multiple types of
products. In such a scenario, a machine may manufacture a particular product
for two weeks,and then the following week the machine is turned off and recon-
figured to be used for manufacturing a new product. You may need to know

CHAPTER 9 Site Analysis
235
about the production schedule for particular machines because different types
of products will interact with your RFID system differently. Knowing all this
ahead of time will help you plan a more efficient system.
Points of Contact
When you arrive on site, you will interact with a few important people, such as
the facility manager (building manager or a plant manager), a safety manager,
shift supervisors, and workers themselves. Why should you talk to these people?
Because you do not want to be an uninvited intrusion into their worlds.You also
need access to their knowledge of the site business processes to help you under-
stand the way things work at the site.
The plant or building manager can easily differentiate between smooth pro-
cedure operation and any operation that is malfunctioning. The facility man-
ager knows the site well, and although he/she probably won’t know the granular
details, this person can help you understand about the business process and fa-
cility policies. When you talk to building or plant managers, get information on
the size of the building, the environment of the building, work schedule, work
flow,and cycles of the workers.The general managers will know the schedule in-
timately and will be able to tell you when is the best time to work or which
groups are going to be most receptive and least problematic. This information
will hopefully help you accomplish your objectives while installing the RFID
equipment.
You should also discuss the expected duration of the various phases of the pro-
ject. Be realistic, and add a couple of days to the estimate so that you don’t create
false expectations in case some difficulties are encountered. With a facility man-
ager,negotiate to determine the appropriate date and time for site analysis and in-
stallation. This should happen preferably during the low cycles of the workday.
Inform management about how the site analysis and system deployment will
affect the facility operation. For example, tell them that, during the system in-
stallation, certain portions of the warehouse may be obstructed or filled with
equipment and installers.
You can also ask about equipment they can provide, such as a scissor lift to
access the ceiling,power tools,and perhaps specialized personnel such as facility
electricians, IT personnel, and others who could help you in your installation
and know the facility well. This conversation will help you determine the tools
and resources you can access on site, who you have to hire, and what you will

236
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
have to rent or ship from your home site. Using the facility resources is a lot less
expensive not only for you, but also for your customers, since they will ulti-
mately end up paying for any rental or shipping costs you encounter while in-
stalling the system.
The shift supervisors can tell you who are your key players. When you start
deploying the RFID solutions, you’ll need to make sure that you have access to a
worker or a supervisor to assist you with deployment and/or troubleshooting,
and you should familiarize this person or persons with the equipment suffi-
ciently so that they can help you resolve any minor issues around the RFID sys-
tem. If you can train key employees who are well respected among their peers,
you become the second-level support, limiting the amount of calls you get at 2
o’clock in the morning: “Hey! This is not working! What do I do?” Instead of
them calling you,they can ask a knowledgeable coworker trained by you for help
in solving many problems. A shift supervisor must approve the engagement of
such personnel in your endeavors.
You may also encounter negativity from workers at the facility regarding the
RFID system’s installation. For example, some may believe that the implemen-
tation is automating a task that was formerly performed by a human, thus the
system is taking work away from employees.To prevent this perception and neg-
ative feelings, work on a communication plan with the customer’s human re-
sources personnel. You can also offer to conduct one-on-one or group
discussions regarding the technical implications of the RFID implementation.
Management should address the business reasons behind selecting and imple-
menting an RFID system,what it means for employees,and how the new system
will help the company as well as them.A well-designed system will add to the ef-
ficiency of the overall operation—whether that operation is manufacturing,
warehousing, or distribution—and you should make sure that everybody
knows this. Onsite management should explain to employees how the system
will benefit them in their daily work. From time-to-time, a new system may re-
sult in staff reductions. Explanation and justification of this to employees is the
job of company management.
That said, don’t be afraid to talk to workers and other personnel. Ask ques-
tions, such as “Do you think this will work for you?” or “Is there anything I can
do to make this better than what I am proposing now?”If you get the workers in-
volved from the beginning, they will feel included in the process and may offer
good pointers that will help your system design.

Site Survey Report
W
hen conducting a site survey,you are also preparing to generate a site sur-
vey report. Ask questions, take pictures, and record everything you find
out. This information is necessary in creating a thorough report.
During a site survey, the person doing the site analysis will not always be the
same person who is designing the overall solution.Instead,a team of people will
contribute to the design of the system. Photos of the proposed IZs will make it
easier for you to explain to the team all site challenges as well as solutions. Team
members may also notice things you missed while they examine the photos.You
can draw on their experience as well as your own.
Regulations and Company Policies
You must follow local regulations as they apply to RF emissions and equipment
installation. For example, a certified electrician must install system wiring, and
this person will be aware of local regulations regarding electrical work. Profes-
sionals will make sure that the electrical wires are installed in conduit and that
all equipment is properly grounded so that electrical devices operate safely. Lo-
cal regulations may also require that the network cables be installed in a steel
conduit. Such requirements vary from county to county, state to state, and
country to country.
You may also have to deal with union regulations. In some shops, only union
installers are allowed to install network,electrical,or electromechanical devices.
Unions also require strict safety procedures. Therefore, you must determine
who in the company can do what work at what time, and what type of external
labor must be used during the installation. Here’s a real-world example to illus-
trate this point. While we were installing a forklift solution at a paper mill, I no-
ticed that the motor shop was overrun with repairs that day. I began installing
RFID equipment to help out.A union employee saw me do this and reported me
to the union. The next day, I was called into the mill manager’s office to explain
why I was turning wrenches on their trucks!
Company regulations and policies are also important to understand,because
your noncompliance may cause big delays and installation problems. For exam-
ple,you may need entering and exiting permits for certain equipment and mate-

rials required for your implementation. Other company regulations and
policies may require personal protective equipment such as steel-toe boots,hard
hats, or safety guards in order to step into certain areas or operate certain ma-
chinery. You also must have a special license to operate a lift, fork truck, or elec-
trical pallet jack. It’s important that you know about licenses, certifications, and
insurance coverage you need before you begin your work.
You may be required to be accompanied by an employee any time you work
in a particular area due to safety or security reasons, or you may need security
clearance (such as on military sites) or even drug testing to participate in activi-
ties at a particular worksite.
Travel Assistance
Make sure you ask about company policy regarding using cameras in
a facility. Some companies are strict about camera usage and require
that you get permission before taking pictures. You may also be
required to provide photos for approval before you leave the site.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 9.1: Infrastructure Assessment
Take notes about the structure
and size of the building and the materials used in the construction of the
floors, walls, and roof. Capture the building layout, including static equip-
ment and paths of moving equipment and personnel. Take measurements
of all spaces where future IZs may be located.
When analyzing the environment at the site, record the temperature and
humidity variations. Document the type of facility in which the system
will be deployed and accordingly note conditions such as humidity experi-
enced in the facility, any chemicals that are used in the process, presence of
industrial dust and dirt, the presence of high-pressure washing, and other
such information. Equipment can be subjected to vibration not only when
installed on or near vehicles such as forklifts, but also on conveyors, manu-
facturing lines, and heavy machinery inside the facility; rail lines, high-
ways, or airports outside of the facility but in the near proximity can also
affect vibration.

239
✔Objective 9.2: RF Characteristics
Sources of interference can be identi-
fied by checking operating frequencies of equipment used within the site
and using a spectrum analyzer. Interference can be caused by wireless net-
works (usually operating at 2.45 GHz,but older types use around 900 MHz),
short range radios, cordless phones (operating at 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz),
cell phones (operating at 900 MHz), microwave ovens, LAN equipment,
neon lights, public or personnel address systems, conveyor belts, large mo-
tors running at 480 volts,electric motors on forklifts,electric power jacks,or
any kind of heavy machinery as well as air-conditioning units. Also look for
harmonic interference.
Set your spectrum analyzer for a slightly wider bandwidth than the fre-
quency band you are investigating and watch for signal spikes. Move to-
ward potential sources of these signals and note whether the signal gets
stronger or weaker. The strongest signal will be the closest to the interfer-
ing device.
✔Objective 9.3: Business Process Documentation
An essential part of a
site analysis is the business process analysis. To design an RFID system that
will track materials, goods, assets, or personnel successfully and efficiently,
you will need to know what the business process is now, how you integrate
the RFID technology into it, or how you will have to change the business
process to achieve the best results.
✔Objective 9.4: Site Survey Report
When performing a site survey or site
assessment, you are also preparing to generate a site survey report. Be sure
you always ask questions, take pictures (with permission if necessary), and
record other important details in the site survey report, because this report
will form the basis for your design of the site’s RFID system.

This chapter discusses various standards and regulations related to the design
and use of RFID systems. It also provides a brief summary of a few RFID man-
dates issued by some commercial and governmental organizations, which drive
a large part of RFID implementations today.
Standards are created by various organizations to facilitate interoperability
among components of the system designed and manufactured by many differ-
ent organizations. Standards define not only hardware and software design,
manufacturing, and development techniques, but they also define its use. Many
organizations develop standards—for example, the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and
EPCglobal.
Regulations are developed by government regulatory agencies, such as Fed-
eral Communications Commission (FCC), Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). While more than one stan-
dard may be available for a particular use and compliance with it is optional,reg-
ulations must be obeyed.Mandate compliance is optional.Mandates are created
by organizations as a policy to interact with various business partners. The fol-
lowing sections describe various RFID standards, regulations, and mandates.
Objective 10.1
Standards
M
any types of organizations create standards:
•
Standards-creating organizations such as ISO, ANSI, and European
Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
•
Technology groups such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME),
and American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
•
Governmental agencies such as Department of Defense (DoD) and FCC
•
Industry consortiums such as Automotive Industry Action Group
(AIAG) and EPCglobal
•
Commercial companies such as IBM, Microsoft, and Cisco
Standards are created to provide interoperability among different components
of a system, interchangeability of components manufactured by different vendors,
andaconsistentuserinterfaceforsimilarsystemscreatedbydifferentorganizations.
Some of the benefits provided by standards are reduced cost, availability of parts
even if the original manufacturer has gone out of business, reduced user training,
and ease of maintenance.Standards also help raise levels of quality,safety,reliability,

CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
245
efficiency,and interchangeability.Standards not only assist engineers and manufac-
turers by helping to solve basic problems in production and distribution, but they
also benefit product users. Use of a standard is typically voluntary, and in some
cases a manufacturer may even choose to comply with only one standard from a
group of similar standards.When many similar standards exist—for example,stan-
dards that apply both to IBM PCs and Apple Macs—the industry becomes seg-
mented and some of the benefits of standards are reduced. However, such
variations also provide paths to alternative technologies.
Some of the disadvantages of standards are the slow acceptance of new tech-
nologies, the length of time required for standards creation, and the fact that
standards are developed by a committee of people who have vested interests in
standardizing the technology developed by their particular companies.To quote
a popular adage, “Standards are like sausages: you don’t want to know how they
are made.”To accommodate the interests of various factions within the commit-
tee, standards often do not implement the technology in an optimal manner.
Small companies are slow in improving the existing technology because it may
require the creation of new standards. But the advantages of standards far out-
weigh the disadvantages,which is evident by the existence of so many standards.
That is why people jokingly say “The good thing about standards is that there
are too many to choose from.”
During the initial phase of new technology development and implementa-
tion, such as RFID, no standards exist, or they are created by a few companies
that are pioneers in the new technology.The standards created by a company are
the intellectual property of this company, and other manufacturers may have to
pay royalties to use them. These types of standards are called proprietary stan-
dards. Standards created by standardization organizations are open and are
available for free or for a small fee that is paid by all the users of the standard.
Until around the middle of 2005, no globally accepted open standards existed
for air interface between the RFID tag and the interrogator.While the open stan-
dards were being developed, growth of the RFID technology was in a holding
pattern, and many manufacturers and users were sitting on the fence, waiting.
With the emergence of the new ISO 18000-6C standard in mid-2006, discussed
later in the chapter, the RFID technology has moved into the fast lane. More
standards are needed for collecting and exchanging RFID data. These standards
are in various stages of development, and as products complying with those
standards become available, the use of RFID technology may explode.
Overall, standards provide many benefits to businesses, governments, and
consumers. Businesses benefit because the widespread adoption of standards
means that suppliers can base the development of their products and services on
specifications that have wide acceptance in their sectors. This, in turn, means
that businesses using standards can freely compete in markets around the

world. Customers get wide choices of products due to the worldwide compati-
bility of technology achieved by use of standards, and they also benefit from the
effects of competition among suppliers. For governments, standards provide
the technological and scientific bases for health,safety,and environmental legis-
lation. Consumers enjoy the benefits of conformity of products and services
with assurances about their quality, safety, and reliability.
Standards Organizations
As mentioned, many organizations develop standards. They may be interna-
tional, regional, national, or industry consortium. Following are some of the
standards-creating organizations:
•
International
•
ISO: International Organization for Standardization
•
IEC: International Electrotechnical Commission
•
ITU: International Telecommunication Union
•
Regional
•
CEN: European Committee for Normalization and Standardization
•
National
•
ANSI: American National Standards Institute
•
BSI: British Standards Institution
•
SCC: Standards Council of Canada
•
AFNOR: Association Française de Normalization (the French
industrial standards authority)
•
JISC: Japan Industrial Standards Committee
•
Industry (these may be international)
•
AIAG: Automotive Industry Action Group
•
EPCglobal
•
UCC/EAN: Uniform Code Council/European Article Numbering
System
Various standards-creating organizations have different detailed develop-
ment processes, but the general process is similar. A working group generates a
document that describes the standard in detail. This document is created after
several technical discussions among members of the group who are experts in
the technology. It is then circulated to the members of groups involved in simi-
lar technologies and their suggested changes are considered. Then the docu-
ment is opened to the general public for comments. Once the issues raised are

satisfactorily resolved, a proposed standard is submitted to various committees
for approval. When that process is completed, it becomes a ratified standard.
The entire process may take from one to three years. The standards-developing
organizations discussed in this chapter are ISO, IEC, ETSI, European
Radiocommunications Office (ERO), DoD, and EPCglobal.
ISO and IEC
The ISO is a network of the national standards institutes of 157 countries.
Each member country,no matter how large or small,gets one vote.The central
secretariat of ISO, located in Geneva, Switzerland, coordinates the entire orga-
nization. ISO is a nongovernmental organization and its members are not, as
is the case in the United Nations system, delegations of national governments.
The participating country selects a domestic organization to be its representa-
tive to ISO—for example, ANSI for the United States, SCC for Canada,
AFNOR for France, BSI for Great Britain, and JISC for Japan. Many of its
member institutes are part of the governmental structure of their countries,
while others are set up by national partnerships of industry associations. ISO
standards meet the requirements of businesses and the broader needs of con-
sumers and users. Since its birth in 1947, ISO has published more than 16,000
international standards.
Just like any other standards, ISO standards are voluntary. ISO has no legal
authority to enforce its implementations. Many countries adopt ISO standards
as part of their regulatory frameworks or refer to them in legislation as the tech-
nical basis. Many ISO standards, such as ISO 9000, have become a market re-
quirement. ISO develops only those standards for which there is a market
requirement. The work is carried out by experts from the industrial, technical,
and business sectors that have asked for the standards and that subsequently put
them to use. Of the approximately 3000 ISO technical groups (technical com-
mittees, subcommittees, working groups, and so on), about 50,000 experts par-
ticipate annually in development of ISO standards.
The IEC is the leading global organization that develops and publishes inter-
national standards for all electrical, electronic, and related technologies. These
serve as a basis for national standardization and as references when drafting in-
ternational tenders and contracts. IEC was created in 1906 and currently has
more than 130 participant countries,including 67 members and 69 affiliates.Its
headquarters are in Geneva. The IEC charter includes all electrotechnologies,
including electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multi-
media, telecommunication, and energy production and distribution. The work
is done by 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry, government,

academia, and test labs. IEC standards use numbers in the range 60000–79999.
IEC also develops standards jointly with ISO (as you can see in Figure 10-1).
Such standards are designated by ISO/IEC followed by a number.Only the stan-
dards developed by ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 on Information Tech-
nology use the ISO/IEC prefix.
Figure 10-1 shows Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) fo-
cused ISO committees and their interrelationships.
ERO
The European Radiocommunications Office provides a center of expertise that
acts as a focal point, identifying problem areas and new possibilities in the radio
and telecommunications fields. It supports and advises the Electronic Commu-
nications Committee (ECC). ERO develops long-term plans for future use of
the radio frequency spectrum in Europe. It also supports and works together
with national frequency-management authorities in European countries.In ad-
dition, it identifies and promotes best practice in administration of national
numbering schemes and numbers. ERO is the distribution point for all ECC
documents and also provides detailed information about the work of the ECC
via the ERO Web site, www.ero.dk. The ERO site provides information about
the latest developments within the ECC with reports of recent meetings and ap-

proved texts of ECC decisions, recommendations, and reports. Many organi-
zations such as government departments, public radiocommunications opera-
tors, manufacturers, users, private network operators, service providers, re-
search institutes, and standards-making bodies participate in ERO work. ERO
has the overall objective of developing proposals for a European Table of Fre-
quency Allocations and Utilizations for the frequency range 9 kHz to 275 GHz.
CEN
The European Committee for Standardization was founded in 1961 by the na-
tional standards bodies in the European Economic Community and European
Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries. CEN contributes to the objectives of
the European Union and European Economic Area with voluntary technical
standards that promote free trade, worker and consumer safety, network
interoperability, environmental protection, research and development pro-
grams, and public procurement.
EPCglobal
EPCglobal is a neutral, consensus-based, not-for-profit standards organization
that functions as a consortium of technology companies and the user commu-
nity. It is a joint venture between EAN International and the Uniform Code
Council (UCC), now called GS1. It was created in October 2003 from the
Auto-ID Center at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The Auto-ID
Center was created by UCC,Procter & Gamble,and Gillette in 1999.Later,more
than 100 companies joined to develop EPCglobal Network. In 2003, when
EPCglobal was created from the Auto-ID Center, the research work done by the
center was transferred to Auto-ID Labs created at six universities in different
countries. In 2004, it created a standard for the air interface protocol at the
860–960 MHz frequency called Generation 2, or Gen 2. It was submitted to ISO
for ratification in early 2005, and it was approved and became an ISO 18000-6C
standard in July 2006.
EPCglobal is now developing standards for the EPCglobal Network, a net-
work to exchange data collected by RFID devices among various partners in the
supply chain. It is working toward establishing the EPC Network as the global
standard. The goal of the EPC Network is to create worldwide real-time visibil-
ity of objects in the supply chain. EPCglobal functions are conducting research
and development work on RFID (in collaboration with Auto-ID Labs); creating
standards and regulations for tags, interrogators, and information systems;
managing the EPCglobal Network including its numbering system, Object
Name Service (ONS) and certification services; and driving adoption via mar-
keting, awareness, business development, and implementation support.

DoD
The US Department of Defense is a large (probably the largest in the world)
consumer of services and goods. It has a budget of well over $500 billion and
60,000 suppliers. To make products from different suppliers interoperate, it cre-
ates its own standards called Military Standards or Mil-standards, available at
the DoD Web site.The standards must be met by all goods supplied to the DoD.
US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Automatic Identification Technology
(AIT) Office is the foundation in the DoD’s efforts to provide timely asset visibil-
ity in the logistics pipeline, whether in-process, in-storage, or in-transit. AIT me-
dia includes barcodes, radio frequency ID, satellite tracking systems, smart cards/
common access cards (CACs), optical memory cards, and contact memory but-
tons.By enabling data collection and transmission to automated information sys-
tems (AISs), AIT provides the various military commanders with the ability to
track, document, and control the deployment of personnel and material.
UCC
The mission of the Uniform Code Council, Inc., is to take a global leadership
role in establishing and promoting multi-industry standards for product identi-
fication and related electronic communication. The goal is to enhance supply
chain management, thus contributing added value to the customer.
EAN International
European Article Numbering International is designed to create global open
standards based on best business practices and to drive their implementation.
Its goal is to play a leading role in improving supply and demand chain manage-
ment worldwide.
Types of Standards
Four categories of standards are typically used in RFID systems:
•
Technology standards
•
Define how various hardware and software should be designed.
These standards provide the details of communications between
the interrogator and tags, the modulation of analog signals, coding
schemes for digital data, and the interrogator commands and tag
responses.
•
Define the interrogator interface with the host.
•
Define the data syntax, structure, and content.
•
Data content standards
•
Define the meaning of bit streams read from the RFID tags and
provide guidelines on how the data shall be presented to applications.

CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
251
•
Specify the commands that are supported for transferring data
between the application and the tag.
•
Provide details of data identifier, application identifier, and data syntax.
•
Conformance standards
•
Define test methods for determining the conformance of devices
(tags and interrogators) to a specific standard.
•
Application standards
•
Define how the technology is implemented for a particular
application. For example, standards for the freight container
identification system will define where and how the RFID tag
should attached to the container.

RFID Standards
This section covers some of the important standards that are part of the
CompTIA RFID+ Certification Exam.
ISO/IEC 18000
The ISO/IEC 18000 series of standards has seven parts and deals only with the
air interface protocol. These standards are not concerned with data content or
the physical implementation of the tags and interrogators. The standards define
use of five frequency bands for communication between interrogator and tags.
Five different frequency bands are used because RF waves of different frequen-
cies are reflected,refracted,and absorbed differently by different materials; a tag
antenna type and size varies with frequency; and maximum read range varies
with frequency and legacy frequency allocations.
Exam Tip
Remember the frequencies related to different parts of ISO/IEC 18000.
252
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

ISO/IEC 18000-1
This is Part 1 of the 18000 series standards. It provides a
framework for defining common communications protocols for globally use-
able frequencies for RFID. It also establishes generic parameters that could be
determined in any standardized air interface definition in the ISO 18000 series.
The specific values for air interface definition parameters related to any fre-
quency are provided by the subsequent parts dealing with that frequency. This
standard establishes a common system management and control and informa-
tion exchange framework that can be used at various frequencies.
ISO/IEC 18000-2
Part 2 specifies parameters for air interface communications
between the interrogator and the tag below 135 kHz frequency.This part defines
protocol, commands, and methods for detecting and communicating with one
tag among several tags (anti-collision),but the implementation of anti-collision
is optional.
Two types of tags, Type-A and Type-B, are defined in this standard. They dif-
fer at the physical layer but support the same anti-collision and protocol.
Type-A tags operate in full duplex (FDX) mode at 125 kHz frequency. They use
the same channel for two-way transmission between tag and interrogator. FDX
tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, including during the
tag-to-interrogator transmission. Type-B tags operate in half duplex (HDX)
mode at 134.2 kHz frequency. They use two different one-way channels for in-
terrogator to tag and tag to interrogator transmission.HDX tags are powered by
the interrogator, except during the tag-to-interrogator transmission.
To claim compliance with this standard, a tag must be of either Type-A or
Type-B. In addition, an interrogator must support both Types A and B tags. De-
pending on the application, an interrogator may be configured as Type-A only,
Type-B only,or as Type-A and Type-B.When configured in Type-A and Type-B,
and when in the inventory phase, the interrogator shall alternate between
Type-A and Type-B interrogation.
ISO/IEC 18000-3
This standard provides parameters for air interface commu-
nications at the 13.56 MHz frequency. It defines the physical layer, collision
management system, and protocol values for RFID systems for item identifica-
tion operating at 13.56 MHz frequency in accordance with the requirements of
ISO 18000-1. This standard has two non-interfering, non-interoperable modes
of operation, intended to address different applications. Both of the modes re-
quire a license from the owner of the intellectual property, which shall be avail-
able on terms in accordance with ISO policy. The interrogator must support
either Mode-1 or Mode-2, or it could optionally support both.
CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
253

Mode-1 is based on ISO 15693 with modification for item management and
is intended to improve the compatibility between vendors.Mode-1 provides the
following parameters:
•
Interrogator to tag data rate: 1.65 Kbps or 26.48 Kbps
•
Tag to interrogator data rate: 26.48 Kbps
Mode-2 allows for higher speed and memory (PJM, or Phase-Jitter Modula-
tion) than Mode-1 and has the following parameters:
•
Interrogator to tag data rate: 423.75 Kbps
•
Tag to interrogator data rate: 105.9375 Kbps on each of 8 channels
ISO/IEC 18000-4
This standard defines the communications protocol used in
the air interface for RFID devices operating at the 2.45 GHz frequency used
in item management applications. It also defines the forward and return link pa-
rameters for technical attributes such as operating frequency,channel bandwidth,
maximum power, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, frequency hop
rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate.
This standard defines two modes.The first mode is for passive tags operating
as an interrogator talks first (ITF), while the second mode is for battery-assisted
tags operating as a tag talks first (TTF). The detailed technical differences be-
tween the modes are provided in the parameter tables of the standard.
Mode-1 has the following characteristics:
•
Applies in a passive backscatter RFID system
•
System uses ITF technique
•
One or more tags within the interrogation zone
•
Range can be greater than 3 feet
•
Much commercial activity for this mode
Mode-2 provides the following features:
•
Used in long-range, high–data rate RFID systems
•
Tag is battery assisted but operating as a TTF
•
The air interface description does not list explicit claim for battery
assistance in the tag
•
Range greater than 300 feet
•
Gross data rate up to 384 Kbps at the air interface in case of read/write
(R/W) tag, while for read only (R/O) tag the data rate is 76.8 Kbps
254
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

ISO/IEC 18000-5
This standard defines the communications protocol used in
the air interface for RFID devices operating at 5.8 GHz frequency used in item
management applications. Due to the lack of commercial interest in the 5.8
GHz frequency RFID system, this standard was withdrawn.
ISO/IEC 18000-6
This standard describes the physical interactions between the
interrogatorandthetag,theprotocolsandthecommands,andthecollisionarbitra-
tion schemes for passive RFID systems operating within the 860 to 960 MHz fre-
quency range. It is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage
interoperability of products for the growing RFID market in the international mar-
ketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes
such as operating frequency,operating channel accuracy,channel bandwidth,max-
imum power,modulation,duty cycle,data coding,bit rate,and bit transmission or-
der. The standard describes three noncompatible Types A, B, and C.
Type-A has these features:
•
Uses pulse interval encoding (PIE) in the forward link
•
Reader talks first
•
Adaptive ALOHA collision arbitration algorithm
•
Uses biphase space FM0 return link encoding
•
Data rate 33/40 Kbps
•
Frequency range 860–930 MHz
Type-B has these features:
•
Uses biphase modulation and Manchester encoding in the forward link
•
Reader talks first
•
Adaptive binary tree collision arbitration algorithm
•
Uses biphase space FM0 return link encoding
•
Data rate 8/40 Kbps
•
Frequency range 860–930 MHz
Type-C has these features:
•
Equivalent to EPC Class 1 Gen 2 standard
•
Discussed in detail in the section “EPCglobal Gen 2”
ISO/IEC 18000-7
Part 7 defines the air interface for RFID devices operating as
an active RF tag in the 433 MHz band used in item management applications. Its
purpose is to provide a common technical specification for RFID devices that
CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
255

256
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
may be used by ISO committees developing RFID application standards. This
standard is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage interoperability
of products in the international marketplace. It defines the forward and return
link parameters for technical attributes such as operating frequency, operating
channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power, spurious
emissions, modulation, duty cycle, and data coding. Typical applications operate
at ranges greater than 1 meter. It was developed for FCC-approved read/write ac-
tive tags. These tags are used by US DoD and Universal Postal Union and have a
read range in excess of 300 feet.
ISO 14443
This standard defines identification cards operating at the 13.56 MHz frequency
using near-field inductive coupling.The cards are usually called proximity cards.
Typical applications include identity, security, payment, mass-transit, and ac-
cess control.The interrogators for these cards use an embedded microcontroller
and a magnetic loop antenna that operates at 13.56 MHz frequency. More re-
cent International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for ma-
chine-readable travel documents specify a cryptographically-signed file format
and authentication protocol for storing biometric features such as photos of the
face, fingerprints, and iris. ISO 14443 systems are designed for a range of about
10 centimeters (3.94 inches),so they are a good fit for applications such as vend-
ing machines.
This standard describes two types of cards: Type-A and Type-B. The key dif-
ferences between these types concern method of signal modulation, coding
schemes, and protocol initialization procedures. Both Type-A and Type-B cards
use the same high-level protocol.
Type-A is the most widely used contactless standard in the world, used
mainly for transport applications. It is used by two products: Mifare, supplied
by Phillips and Infineon, and version A of PicoPass, supplied by Inside
Contactless. Type-B has a number of advantages over Type-A. It requires no
patents on communication coding, is widely adopted by reader manufacturers
with proven interoperability, and has been adopted as a national standard by
countries such as Japan, China, and the United States.
ISO 15693
ISO 15693 is an ISO standard for vicinity cards,which can be read from a greater
distance compared to proximity cards defined by ISO 14443.ISO 15693 systems
operate at the 13.56 MHz frequency,use near-field inductive coupling,and offer
maximum read distance of 3 to 5 feet. This range makes them a good fit for ap-
plications such as physical access or controlling entry to a parking garage,where
it’s inconvenient for users to open their doors or roll down a window just to get a

CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
257
contactless smart card close enough to the reader. It also serves as the founda-
tion for a variety of applications outside of contactless smart cards, such as air-
line baggage tracking and supply chain management.
Communication from the reader to the card uses amplitude shift keying with
10 percent or 100 percent modulation index. The card sends its data back to the
reader in two ways: amplitude shift keying and frequency shift keying. Both
methods use the Manchester code to encode data. The data rate is 26 Kbps,
which is about four times slower than that of 14443 standards but provides the
increased communication range. The contactless cards usually transfer small
amounts of data, so throughput isn’t a deciding or noticeable factor. It has been
widely adopted by access control applications and is currently penetrating other
markets. Such an extensive adoption means more ISO 15693–compliant com-
ponents with lower prices on the market as their volumes increase. Also, the de-
sign of the interrogator is simpler, giving further advantage in device cost.
Travel Advisory
Don’t confuse ISO 15693 with ISO 15963, which is used for RFID
for Item Management–Unique Identification of the RF tag.
ISO/IEC 15961
This standard establishes host-interrogator-tag functional commands and syn-
tax features such as RFID tag types,data storage formats,and compaction types.
The commands and syntax are independent of transmission media and air in-
terface protocols. It is intended to be a companion standard to 15962, which
provides the overall protocol for data handling.The 15961 standard comprises a
super set of all functional commands and other syntax features appropriate to
RFID for item management. The 15961 functional commands are at a higher
abstract level than those of the ISO 18000 series. The interrogator-tag com-
mands of 18000 series are at a detailed lower level and are specific to the particu-
lar technologies that are part of 18000.
ISO/IEC 15962
This standard establishes RFID for item management data syntax. It specifies
the interface procedures used to exchange information in an RFID system for
item management. Since no direct communication can occur between the host
system and the RFID tag, the protocols established in this standard ensure the
correct formatting of data,the structure of commands,and the processing of er-
rors in the RFID system. This standard provides a basis of interoperability for
current and legacy systems and a migration path to future systems.

258
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
ISO/IEC 15963
This standard establishes unique identification of RF tag and registration au-
thority to manage the uniqueness. It specifies the numbering system for the
identification of an RF tag, the registration procedure, and the use of it. The
numbering system provides to the RFID application a means of uniquely identi-
fying an RF tag. This number is encoded in the integrated circuit of the RFID
tag. This standard consists of the following two parts:
•
Part 1: Numbering system
•
Part 2: Registration procedure and management guidance and rules
This standard permits addressing three main domains of the RFID system:
•
Traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in their
manufacturing process
•
Traceability of the RF tags during their manufacturing process and
along their life in the applications in which they are used
•
Anti-collision of multiple tags in the reader’s field of view
EPCglobal Gen 2
This standard is officially called EPC Radio-Frequency Identity Protocols Class 1
Generation 2 UHF RFID protocol for communications at 860–960 MHz Version
1.0.9. It was developed by EPCglobal, Inc., and was approved as ISO 18000-6C
in July 2006. It defines air interface parameters for tags operating within the fre-
quency range of 860–960 MHz and allows for use of different frequencies in dif-
ferent regions from within this range. Different regions of the world have
varying frequencies allocated for RFID in UHF range. For example, 902–928
MHz in the United States, 865–868 MHz in Europe, 908.5–914.0 MHz in Korea,
and 952–954 MHz in Japan.
Local Lingo
Gen 2
You will see Gen 2, C1G2, Class 1 Generation 2, or ISO 18000-6C, but
all of these terms refer to the previously-mentioned EPC Radio-Frequency
Identity Protocols Class 1 Generation 2 UHF RFID protocol for communi-
cations at 860–960 MHz developed by EPCglobal and ratified by the ISO.
Key Gen 2 features are as follows:
•
Ability to change encoding according to the environment
The reader
changes the encoding method, the Miller sub-carrier or FM0, according
to the noise in the environment. In a low-noise environment it may use
FM0 encoding, which is faster, but as noise increases it may switch to

Miller sub-carrier, which is designed to optimize performance in noisy
and dense reader environments. This decreases the number of tags read
per second but allows tags to be read in harsher environments.
•
Three modes for reader operation
The reader may operate in single,
multi, and dense environments. A dense reader environment (see the
following Local Lingo) is designed for enterprise deployments in which
hundreds of readers are operating at the same time.
•
Tag population management
Provides select, inventory, and access
commands for efficient reading of tags—for example, a group of tags
may be selected with a wild card pattern.
•
Longer kill and access passwords
32-bits-long access and kill
passwords increase the level of security for the data on the tags.
•
Forward link data protection
Tags provide a randomly generated
number to the reader to encode the data sent by the reader to the tags.
•
Four sessions for tag inventory
Tag may operate in four different
sessions at the same time, so four different readers can communicate
with the tag at the same time without interfering with each other.
•
Faster data transmission rate up to 640 Kbps
This is five times faster
than the previous standards.
•
Improved tag memory and programmability
Tag memory is divided
into four banks. A bank may have read-only, write once, and read/write
parts within it. This provides better tag security and application flexibility.
Tag memory has four banks numbered from 0 to 3.Bank 0,called Reserved
Memory, holds Kill and Access passwords, each 32 bits long; Bank 1, called
EPC Memory, holds the EPC including the EPC header or Asset Family
Identifier (AFI) based on ISO 15961, Protocol Control (PC) and Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC-16); Bank 2, called Tag Identification Memory,
holds a tag identifier based on ISO 15963, this bank is not rewritable; and
Bank 3, called User Memory, is optional and holds user defined data.
•
Q Algorithm
Provides faster resolution of tag collision and increased
security for communication between tag and reader.
•
More robust tag communication design
Reduces potential for ghost
reads and entry of erroneous data into the application.
Local Lingo
Dense reader environment
Dense reader environment and dense
interrogator environment have equal meanings.

EPC Tag Data Standards, Version 1.3
This standard defines EPC tag data formats for Generation 2 tags.It defines how
the EPC is encoded on the tag and how it is encoded for use in the information
systems layers of the EPC Systems Network. The standard includes specific en-
coding schemes for EPC General Identifier (GID).It also defines encoding of six
other numbering systems used in global trade:

The standard defines two versions for each of these six numbering schemes.
One version has a length of 64 bits, while the other has 96 bits. Table 10-1 shows
the GID-96 numbering scheme
Travel Advisory
The 64-bit EPC is currently approaching its sunset in favor of 96-bit EPC.
The EPC tag encodings include a header field followed by one or more value
fields. The header field defines the overall length and format of the value fields.
The value fields contain a unique EPC identifier and optional filter value. The
EPC uniform resource identifier (URI) encodings provide the means for appli-
cations software to process EPC. The encoding schemes are independent of the
tag types used. This standard defines four different categories of URI:
•
URIs for pure identities, sometimes called canonical forms
These
contain only the unique information that identifies a specific physical
object and are independent of tag encodings.
•
URIs that represent specific tag encodings
These are used in software
applications where the encoding scheme is relevant, as when commanding
software to write a tag.

Exam Tip
You will not be asked about the URIs, but they are good to know in your
RFID endeavors.
This concludes the discussion of important RFID standards.Many more stan-
dards are used in design, manufacturing, deployment, and maintenance of RFID
systems. More detailed information regarding all the standards is available from
the Web sites of the ISO and EPCglobal or from published documents.
Objective 10.2
Regulations
R
F signals (waves) travel almost forever and pass through many solid materi-
als (though their strength does get reduced due to path loss and absorp-
tion). Therefore, they cannot be easily contained within a desired space, nor can
we ignore the effects of radio signals transmitted by devices located in a long
distance, even thousands of feet, away. These devices may be inside other build-
ings and may not be visible, but they can interfere with your RF system, and
your system can interfere with them. These types of interferences affect the per-
formance of an RF system. They may, depending on their relative strength, re-
duce the read range of your system or render the system inoperable.
Since RF signals do not obey the normal property boundaries created by hu-
mans,they create an environment like the Wild West of older,where bullets shot
by good or bad guys fly forever, passing through some walls and ricocheting off
others. Anybody in the path of these bullets can be injured. To prevent this type
of chaos with RF signals, a system of “laws and sheriffs” is needed to make sure
that nobody gets hurt. In the RFID arena, various governmental agencies called
regulatory authorities provide this system.
CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
261

These regulatory authorities define who can use what RF for what purposes
and how. Consider, for example, radio and TV stations. Each station, in addition
to other attributes, is assigned a geographic location, radio frequency band, and
strength of the radio signal they can emit from their antennas. This prevents one
station from interfering with the other stations,and as a result everybody is able to
listen to their station of choice.These regulations are laws of the land and must be
obeyed. Unlike standards, which are optional, regulations are mandatory, and if
they are not followed properly,legal consequences will ensue.If you do not follow
standards,your devices may not interoperate with other devices or some custom-
ers may not buy your products, but you can still continue doing business, albeit
with financial consequences.If you do not follow the regulations,government au-
thorities may fine you,and the repeated violations may result in more severe pen-
alties such as not being allowed to make or use RF devices—or even a jail term.
Another reason to control RF transmission is to avoid injuries to humans
and animals. RF devices transmit and receive RF energy. For example, Wi-Fi de-
vices operating at 2.4 GHz range,which is the same frequency a microwave oven
uses, can seriously damage human tissue if they transmit a signal at a very high
level. In a low strength, they are considered harmless. A regulation must be es-
tablished as to the level of safe exposure, and some mechanism has to be created
to certify and monitor compliance.
RF regulations typically vary from one country to another or from one re-
gion to another, due to the legacy usage of various portions of the RF spectrum.
In the technology’s early years, various countries or regions assigned different
chunks of the RF spectrum for different uses. No worldwide standard was avail-
able, and even now none exist for many parts of the spectrum. Finding a world-
wide RF range for new RF applications is a problem. For example, in the US, the
UHF RFID systems are allocated a frequency range of from 902 to 928 MHz,but
in European countries, that range was already assigned to other uses and is
therefore not available. In Europe, UHF RFID systems are assigned a frequency
range of 865 to 868 MHz. As a result, a tag designed for the US will have prob-
lems being read in Europe and vice versa. To overcome these problems, RFID
systems must be designed to incorporate all the frequency ranges (within the
UHF band) used all over the world. This has been accomplished by EPCglobal
Gen 2 and ISO 18000-6C standards. Readers and tags designed according to
these standards will interoperate anywhere in the world.
For UHF RFID tags and readers, regulations encompass the following major
factors:
•
RF field power
Effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) in watts.
•
Bandwidth usage
The frequency range allocated.
262

•
Channels and channel spacing
How the allocated frequency range is
divided into channels to incorporate reader to reader interference.
•
Duty cycle
The percentage of time a reader can actively transmit.
Some of the main bodies in various countries governing frequency alloca-
tions and regulations for RFID are presented in Table 10-2.
Regulatory Organizations
This section discusses some of the leading RF regulatory bodies that control use
of the radio spectrum in many regions of the world. These organizations are
created by one country or a regional consortium of many countries.
International Regulations: ITU
The International Telecommunication Union was established in Paris as the In-
ternational Telegraph Union in 1865 and is today the world’s oldest international
organization. It became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1947. Its
main tasks include standardization, allocation of the radio spectrum, and orga-
nizing interconnection arrangements among countries to allow international
phone calls—in which regard it performs for telecommunications a similar func-
tion to what the UPU performs for postal services. It is one of the specialized
agencies of the United Nations, and has its headquarters in Geneva, next to the
main United Nations campus.It provides a forum in which its 189 member states,
some 650 sector members, and more than 90 associates can cooperate for the im-
provement and rational use of telecommunication worldwide.

Main Regulatory Organizations Related to RFID

The ITU is made up of three bureaus:
•
Telecommunications Bureau (ITU-T)
•
Radiocommunications Bureau (ITU-R)
•
Development Bureau (ITU-D)
The international standards that are produced by the ITU are referred to as
“Recommendations” (with the word ordinarily capitalized to distinguish its
meaning from the ordinary sense of the word recommendation). Due to the
ITU’s longevity as an international organization and its status as a specialized
agency of the United Nations, standards promulgated by the ITU carry a higher
degree of formal international recognition than those of most other organiza-
tions that publish technical specifications of a similar form. ITU has divided the
world in three different regions, as shown in Figure 10-2.
Regulations in Europe: ETSI
The European Telecommunications Standards Institute is an independent,
not-for-profit organization located in Sophia Antipolis, France. Its mission is to
produce telecommunications standards, and it is officially responsible for stan-
dardization of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) within
Europe.It develops a wide range of standards and provides interoperability test-
ing services. ETSI has 654 members from 59 countries inside and outside Eu-
rope, including manufacturers, network operators, administrations, service
providers,research bodies,and users.ETSI’s prime objective is to support global
harmonization by providing a forum in which all key players can contribute ac-
tively. ETSI is officially recognized by the European Commission and the EFTA
(European Free Trade Association) secretariat. Two of the most important
RFID regulations created by ETSI are EN 300-220 and EN 302-208.

ERO
The European Radiocommunications Office is the permanent office that supports
the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC), formerly the European
Radiocommunications Committee (ERC). The ECC is the telecommunications
regulation committee for the European Conference of Postal and Telecommu-
nications Administrations (CEPT), representing 46 countries and covering
most of the geography of Europe. The main task of the ECC is to develop radio-
communications policies. It coordinates frequency regulation and technical mat-
ters for the allocation and utilization of the 9 kHz to 275 GHz frequency range.
The ERO publishes and distributes ECC Decisions and Recommendations.
Recommendations related to the use of short range devices (SRDs) are found in
ERC Recommendation 70-03. The ERC Decision ERC/DEC(01)04 addresses
nonspecific SRDs operating in 868.0–868.6 MHz, 868.7–869.2 MHz,
869.40–869.65 MHz, and 869.7–870.0 MHz.
Regulations in the United States: FCC
The Federal Communications Commission is an independent agency of the US gov-
ernment,directly responsible to Congress.It was established by the Communications
Act of 1934 and is charged with regulating interstate and international communica-
tions by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable. The FCC’s jurisdiction covers the
50 states, the District of Columbia, and US possessions. The FCC is directed by five
commissioners appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The presi-
dent designates one of the commissioners to serve as chairperson. The commission-
ers supervise all FCC activities, delegating responsibilities to staff units and bureaus.
Thecommissionincludessixoperatingbureausandtenstaff officeswithintheFCC.
One of the bureaus is the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau (WTB),
which handles nearly all FCC domestic wireless telecommunications programs,
policies, and outreach initiatives. Wireless communications services include
amateur, cellular, paging, broadband PCS, public safety, and more. FCC regu-
lates RF usage via regulations that are laws in the United States, and all RF usage
within the US must confirm to these regulations.
In the US, FCC Part 15 regulates the use of RF devices. Its subpart C deals
with intentional (fixed) radiators, and Section 15.247 specifically deals with
RFID devices operating at UHF frequencies within the bands of 902–928 MHz,
2400.0–2483.5 MHz, and 5725–5850 MHz. UHF can be used unlicensed for
908–928 MHz,but restrictions exist for transmission power and channel usage.
RFID Regulations
This section discusses some of the important regulations created by the organi-
zations and agencies discussed in the previous section. These regulations define
in detail how RF can be used and for what purposes.

FCC Part 15
RFID devices operating at UHF frequencies are allowed for operation in the In-
dustrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) bands under conditions defined in FCC
Part 15 rules, Section 15.247. Section 15.247 defines operation within the bands
902–928 MHz, 2400.0–2483.5 MHz, and 5725–5850 MHz. The 902–928 MHz
band offers optimum range of operation and is usually preferred for supply
chain applications. Part 15–compliant RFID systems typically use a fre-
quency-hopping spread spectrum modulation technique to benefit from maxi-
mum reader transmitted power allowances. Part 15–compliant UHF readers
can operate at a maximum transmitted power of 1 watt, or up to 4 watts with a
directional antenna,if they hop across a minimum of 50 channels.For more de-
tails, you can download Part 15 rules from the FCC Web site.
FCC Section 15.247 has nine different paragraphs that provide specifications
for using RF devices, as shown in Table 10-3.
FCC Section 15.247(b) deals with regulations for frequency hopping within
902–928 MHz:
•
If the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is less than 250 kHz,
the system shall use at least 50 hopping frequencies and the average
time of occupancy on any frequency shall not be greater than 0.4
seconds within a 20-second period.
•
If the 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is 250 kHz or greater,
the system shall use at least 25 hopping frequencies and the average
time of occupancy on any frequency shall not be greater than 0.4
seconds within a 10-second period.
•
The maximum allowed 20 dB bandwidth of the hopping channel is
500 kHz.

Description of FCC 15.247 Paragraphs

CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
267
FCC Section 15.247(b) deals with maximum peak conducted output power
of intentional radiators:
•
The conducted output power limit for various frequency bands is based
on the use of antennas with directional gains that do not exceed 6 dBi.
•
If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 dBi are used
(see Section 15.247(c)), the conducted output power from the intentional
radiator shall be reduced below the stated values, as appropriate, by the
amount in dB that the directional gain of the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
•
For systems using digital modulation in the 902–928 MHz, 2400.0–2483.5
MHz, and 5725–5850 MHz bands, the maximum peak conducted output
power of intentional radiators is 1 watt.
•
As an alternative to a peak power measurement, compliance with the 1
watt limit can be based on a measurement of the maximum conducted
output power.
ETSI EN 300-220
This standard applies to SRD radio transmitters and receivers. It covers trans-
mitters in the range from 25 to 1000 MHz and with power levels ranging up to
500 mW, and receivers in the range from 25 to 1000 MHz. It defines the techni-
cal characteristics for radio equipment. It defines product family information
that may be completely or partially superseded by specific standards covering
specific applications.It applies to a RF output connection and/or an integral an-
tenna and to alarms,identification,telecommands,and telemetry applications.
When selecting parameters for new SRDs, which may have inherent safety of
human life implications, providers and users should pay particular attention to
the potential for interference from other systems operating in the same or adja-
cent bands. It covers fixed stations, mobile stations, and portable stations, and
requirements are provided for the different frequency bands, channel separa-
tions, modulations, and other parameters. Some of the parameters defined are
frequency range 869.4 to 869.65 MHz, bandwidth 0.25 MHz, maximum allow-
able power 0.5 watts ERP, one channel, and 10 percent duty cycle. National re-
strictions may apply to the regulation.
ETSI EN 302-208
The key features of ETSI regulation EN 302-208 are as follows:
•
Shared operation in band 865–868 MHz at transmit powers up to 2
watts effective radiated power (ERP)
•
Mandatory “listen before talk” function
•
Operation in sub-bands of 200 kHz

•
Power levels of 100 mW, 500 mW, and 2 W ERP
•
Mandatory listen time of more than 5 ms before each transmission
•
Maximum period of continuous transmission of 4 seconds
•
Pause of 100 ms between repeated transmissions on the same sub-band,
or the interrogator will move immediately to another vacant sub-band
This regulation allows European RFID interrogators operating in the UHF
band to perform nearly as well as UHF interrogators operating under FCC rules
in the United States. It provides an additional frequency range, compared to EN
302-200, from 865 to 868 MHz for RFID interrogator operation. This increases
the spectrum band from 250 kHz to 3 MHz. The number of channels on which
readers can broadcast has been increased from 1 to 15. The new band is divided
into three sub-bands (see Figure 10-3). Under the old regulations EN 300-220,
UHF readers were restricted to half a watt of ERP. The new regulations allow
them to emit up to 0.1 watt ERP between 865 and 865.5 MHz, 2 watts ERP be-
tween 865.6 and 867.6 MHz, and 0.5 watt ERP between 867.6 and 868 MHz.
The duty cycle restrictions are replaced with the listen before talk (LBT) algo-
rithm.The interrogator can stay on a selected channel for up to 4 seconds; it must
then stop emitting energy for at least 0.1 second to provide other devices with the
opportunity to use the channel. The interrogator could also switch immediately
to any other unoccupied channel and transmit. The interrogators without LBT
capabilities are limited to a 0.1 percent duty cycle. The data rate of this regulation
is less than in the United States. This is because only 3 MHz of the spectrum is
available in Europe for RFID, while 26 MHz is available in the United States.
Regulations in Canada
In the 902–908 MHz UHF band, Canadian standards are similar to US regula-
tions. The Canadian Cattle Identification Agency (CCIA) or recently named
Canadian Livestock Identification Agency (CLIA) has recommended that all ani-
mal tags be replaced with RFID tags. This has been backed by the Canadian cattle
industry so it can continue to meet domestic and international requirements for

animal health and food safety through an efficient trace-back and age verification
process using RFID technology. Removing a CCIA tag is a serious offense in
Canada. CCIA requires that all approved RFID tags are yellow in color.
Regulations in Japan
The Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Post and Telecommunica-
tions (MPHPT), whose English name has been recently changed to Ministry of
Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC),is responsible for formulating poli-
cies related to communications, which includes setting up of RFID standards
within Japan. MIC has agreed to open up the UHF spectrum range of 952–954
MHz for RFID use. High-powered passive tag systems can use an antenna power
between 10 mW to 1 W and an antenna gain of 6 dBi, which gives maximum
power equivalent to 4 W EIRP. Users must obtain a license to use this RFID
system.For low-powered systems of up to 10 mW,no user license is required.You
may also see a band of 950–956 MHz specified for Japanese regulation,since Japa-
nese regulations are not yet 100 percent established.
Regulations in China
In the last few years, China has been in the process of developing its own RFID
standards to be in line with global standards. Standardization in China starts
with the Standardization Administration of China (SAC),a ministry-level orga-
nization in the Chinese government. Under this organization are many Technical
Committees focused on specific technology and business areas. The RFID
National Standards Working Group, under China National Registry of Product
and Service Codes (NPC), is responsible for standardizing hardware-related
issues including frequency allocation, bandwidth, and tag-to-reader communi-
cation. The Article Numbering Center of China (ANCC) is focused on the tag
encoding format making sure that goods tagged in China are compliant with
the Electronic Product Code (EPC) coding scheme.
Regulations in India
The Indian government arm that regulates applications of radio waves, the De-
partment of Telecommunication (under the Ministry of Communications and
Information Technology), has recently delicensed the spectrum in the 865–867
MHz band for use by RFID devices. The regulation on the use of wireless equip-
ment in the band 865–867 MHz specifies that no license is required by any person
to establish, maintain, work, possess, or deal in RFID on noninterference,
nonprotection,and nonexclusive bases,in the frequency band 865–867 MHz with
maximum 1 W transmitter power, 4 W ERP, and 200 kHz carrier bandwidth.
Regulations in Australia
The UHF band for RFID operations in Australia is 918–926 MHz with a power of
1 W EIRP. The cattle, food, and beverages industry is supporting Australia’s drive

to integrate internationally with the RFID technology.The Australian Communi-
cation Authority, responsible for setting RFID standards within Australia, has
been considering the globally accepted industry-driven standards for the EPC.
Regulations in Singapore
The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) of Singapore regulates radio fre-
quencies allocated for various applications within Singapore. The IDA has re-
cently announced the new spectrum allocation and power limits for RFID usage
in Singapore in the UHF band.
Singapore allows use of the 866–869 MHz and 923–925 MHz bands within
the UHF spectrum for RFID activities. The power limit for both bands is 0.5 W.
It is expected that the power limit for the 923–925 MHz band will be increased
to 2 W for RFID devices. Table 10-4 summarizes key regulatory parameters in
various parts of the world.
Objective 10.3
Industry Mandates
M
andates are not part of the RFID+ certification exam but since there is so
much talk about them in the RFID industry,this section provides some in-
formation about them. Mandates are created by large organizations that buy
goods from many suppliers located around the world. Their goal is to create, by
using RFID, a more efficient supply chain and thereby reduce costs. As with stan-
dards, compliance with mandates is not required, but noncompliance may affect
your relationship with the mandating organization—for example, you may not
be able to do business with them. All the mandates require use of UHF systems,
and almost all of them now require the use of Gen 2 (ISO 18000-6C) tags.

CHAPTER 10 Standards and Regulations
271
All the mandates are phased in over a time period of more than one year and
include using RFID tags on pallets and cases of items shipped.No item-level tag-
ging has been mandated yet. Mandates also require some sort of electronic doc-
ument to be sent to the customer with a list of all the tag numbers shipped.
Many suppliers, particularly small companies, have started placing RFID tags
on cases and pallets just before shipping them. This is typically called “tag and
ship” or “slap and ship.” The companies using slap and ship are incurring the
cost of the RFID system but are not getting any benefits from it. One advantage
of mandates is that they have accelerated the use of RFID. Without the man-
dates, many companies would not have quickly adopted RFID.
CHECKPOINT
✔Objective 10.1: Standards
To design and implement a well-functioning
RFID system, you must comply with related standards that can be interna-
tional, regional, and national, as well as regulations for the particular coun-
try and operation. Standards define air interface protocols, data protocols,
and capabilities and functions of various types of RFID and RF systems.
The air interface protocol defines the rules of communication between an
interrogator and a tag. Tag data format or the tag data protocol defines the
structure and encoding of data to a tag.
Main international standards that need to be observed for RFID are ISO
14443 for proximity cards (HF), ISO 15693 for vicinity cards (HF), ISO
15963 for ID of RF tags, and ISO/IEC 18000 air interface protocol for RFID
systems (LF,HF,UHF active and passive,microwave).Other important stan-
dards are national standards created by organizations such as ANSI in the
United States and BSI in the UK.Compliance with standards is important to
ensure proper function, interoperability, and safety. Regulations are devel-
oped by each country or region (such as EU). In the US, the regulations for
RFID are developed by the FCC (remember part 15.247); in the EU, it is
ETSI (remember EN 300 220 and EN 302 208). Other national regulatory
organizations are SAC in China, MIC in Japan, DOT in India, IDA in Singa-
pore, to name a few. Regulation compliance is mandatory and you can be
fined for noncompliance.
✔Objective 10.2: Regulations
Regulations deal mainly with transmitted
power limits to prevent interference and ensure human safety.In the US,RFID
is regulated by FCC, where FCC Part 15 allows up to 4 W EIRP with gained

272
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
antenna and hopping across 50 channels in a frequency band 902–928 MHz.
In Europe, RFID is regulated by ETSI’s two main standards. ETSI EN 300 220
regulates frequency band 869.4–869.65 MHz and allows 0.5 W ERP with 10
percent duty cycle.Newer EN 302 208 adds the band of 865–858 MHz,and al-
lows ERP up to 2 W and LBT. Japan allows current RFID operations at
952–954 MHz with 4 W EIRP.
The transmitted power of RFID and other radiating systems is limited to
ensure human safety when exposed to these signals. The limits are set by vari-
ous regulatory organizations (such as FCC and ETSI).If your system operates
under local regulations and complies with standards, it is safe for installation,
handling,and operation by human personnel as far as exposure to RF waves.
✔Objective 10.3: Industry Mandates
Mandates are created by large organi-
zations that buy goods from many suppliers located around the world.Their
goal is to create,by using RFID,a more efficient supply chain and thereby re-
duce the cost. Noncompliance with a mandate may affect your relationship
with the mandating organization.

In my former life as a LAN/WAN professional, I used to ask the question,
Why should I certify? Having learned my lessons on the “street,” I would
watch the “pedigree” engineers struggle with a problem, only to give up
while the “street”engineer would step in and solve the problem but never re-
ceive credit for it. Years later, after I was over my embitterment about this, I
saw (with help from my super-certified brother) the answer. Plain and sim-
ple: it’s about credibility.
As a real-world engineer you can solve the problem, but will you ever get the
chance? Taking the time to test out of a certification program tells your em-
ployer that you not only know what you are talking about, but you are secure
enough in your knowledge to prove it.
As the RFID industry gains momentum, more and more consulting oppor-
tunities present themselves. Individuals pursuing these opportunities find im-
mense value in certification of knowledge, as certification often is the very
reason they are selected for the job. Many of my students are already well versed
in consulting and project management and use the RFID+ certification as an-
other tool in their vast array of already established solutions capabilities.
RFID+ certification was created to address the needs of this emerging mar-
ket. Once certified, a RFID+ certified technician should have the core knowl-
edge to install and troubleshoot RFID reader installations, participate in RFID
solution design, identify various RFID tag and reader technologies visibly, de-
cide what technology best addresses a specific scenario, and contribute as a
value-add to any RFID solutions team. Many RFID+ certified technicians are
former LAN/WAN professionals or supply-chain support professionals who are
looking to utilize the skills they have as they acquire more.
As this certification has been designed as a vendor-neutral, entry-level
exam focused on RFID systems implementation, you may want to consider
continuing your education in areas that are closely related to RFID systems or
where the RFID systems plug in. This means that knowledge of networking,
computer hardware and programming, as well as vendor-specific RFID hard-
ware and software could lead you on the interesting career path of an RFID
professional.
To achieve some credibility in those areas, consider following certifications:
•
CompTIA Network+ Certification
•
CompTIA A+ Certification
•
CWNP–Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA)
•
CompTIA Linux+ Certification
•
Vendor-specific certifications
280
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

CompTIA Network+ Certification
CompTIA Network+ Certification is one
of the recommended certifications you should master before you take the
RFID+ exam. If you haven’t been certified in Network+, I suggest you do it be-
fore taking the RFID+ exam. This certification will demonstrate your skills in
installation, configuration, and troubleshooting of basic networking hardware,
protocols,and services,which is essential knowledge for design and deployment
of RFID networks.
CompTIA A+ Certification
CompTIA A+ Certification shows that you have
the ability to deal with issues that can come up during installation, configura-
tion,diagnosis,preventive maintenance,and basic networking of computer sys-
tems,which are used as host systems for the RFID installations.By this increased
competency, you will not have to depend on local IT folks when it comes to
smooth cooperation of an RFID system with an internal IT system.
CWNP–Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA)
CWNA provides
an in-depth testing of your knowledge of wireless communications, radio fre-
quency,and local area networking,which are essential for deployment of 802.11
wireless communication devices. This is especially important since this type of
data transfer has become more and more popular with mobile as well as fixed
RFID applications.
CompTIA Linux+ Certification
Since many back-end systems as well as RFID
readers are running on a Linux platform,you should acquire the knowledge and
certification of Linux, which demonstrates your ability of fundamental man-
agement of Linux systems from the command line, knowledge of user adminis-
tration, understanding of file permissions and software configurations, and
management of Linux-based clients, server systems, and security.
Vendor-Specific Certifications
In your career as an RFID professional, you
will encounter devices made by various manufacturers. They will all work on
the same principle, however, though their features and capabilities may be
slightly different. To sell, use, and troubleshoot the equipment properly, you
should receive specific certifications from vendors such as Symbol, Printronix,
ThingMagic, Zebra, Sun Microsystems, Intermec, and others.

Glossary
active tag
Active tags have an internal battery to power them and an active
transmitter to transmit data. Some active tags contain replaceable batteries for
years of use; others are sealed units. Active tags generally can transmit data over
a longer distance, are considerably larger than passive tags, and have a limited
operational lifespan. They are generally used for tracking expensive items over
long ranges.
agile reader
An RFID reader that can read tags operating at different fre-
quencies and/or using different protocols to communicate between the tags and
readers.
air interface protocol
The standards that define how RFID tags and readers
communicate using radio waves.

MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
levels are usually used:a level to represent a digital one and a lower level to repre-
sent digital zero. This is a special case of amplitude modulation.
antenna
A transducer made of a conductive material that converts alternat-
ing current (AC) supplied through an antenna’s feed line to radio waves and also
converts received radio waves to AC. Radio waves radiate outward from the an-
tenna.RFID systems use two types of antennas: one connected to the reader and
another on the tag. RFID systems use two types of antennas: one connected to
the reader and another on the tag.
antenna gain
The ratio of the amount of energy radiated in one direction and
the energy radiated by a reference antenna in the same direction when driven by
the identical input. Gain is generally specified in decibels (dB). Usually we are
interested in the maximum gain—the direction in which the antenna is radiat-
ing the most power.
anti-collision
In the context of RFID, refers to different ways of keeping ra-
dio waves from one tag from interfering with radio waves from another tag.
Anti-collision algorithm is used to collect data from multiple RFID tags
present at the same time in a reader’s interrogation zone without interfer-
ence.
Association for Automatic Identification and Mobility
A trade association
of companies that globally provide products and services related to automatic
identification, data collection, networking, and information management sys-
tems.
ATR (Answer To Reset)

powered on.
attenuation
Reduction of RF energy from an RFID tag or reader; water ab-
sorbs UHF energy, causing signal attenuation.
attenuator

power of the RF signal as the signal travels through the cable from the reader
to the antenna. Attenuators usually work by dissipating the RF energy into
heat.

EPCglobal now continues this work.
Auto-ID Labs
Nonprofit research labs, headquartered at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, that continue to perform primary research into the de-
velopment of Electronic Product Code (EPC) and related technologies.
Automatic Identification (Auto-ID)

collecting data and entering it into computer systems without human involve-
ment. Technologies normally considered part of Auto-ID include barcodes,
biometrics, RFID, and voice recognition.

content as soon as it enters an RF field from a read/write unit, without the need
of a special command.
back channel
Communication method used by the signal returning from the
RFID tag back to the interrogator.Also known as reverse channel or reverse link.
backscatter
A method of communication by which a tag reflects the carrier
wave received from the interrogator. To transfer information, the tag modulates
the amplitude of the reflected wave. Passive and semi-passive tags use this
method to send information to the interrogator.
barcode
A way of encoding information using black-and-white stripes or
patches.Stripes are used by linear barcodes and patches are used by two-dimen-
sional barcodes. The most common barcode is Universal Product Code (UPC)
used on most grocery and retail items. Barcodes are read using laser scanners
and require a line-of-sight.
base station
An electronic device made up of an RF transmitter, a receiver,
and an antenna. It is used to communicate with RFID transponders and
contactless smart cards. It connects systems such as access control terminals,
ticket vending machines, and car immobilizer units to host computers.
battery-assisted tag (BAT)
An RFID tag that has a battery but does not have
an active transmitter. It communicates using the same backscatter technique
used by passive tags. It uses the battery to run the circuitry on the integrated cir-
cuit and sometimes an on-board sensor.BATs have a longer read range than pas-

286
MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT
sive tags. They are sometimes called semi-passive RFID tags or battery-assisted
passive (BAP) tags.
baud
In a digitally modulated signal, baud measures symbol rate: that is, the
number of distinct symbol changes (signaling events) made to the transmission
medium per second. The baud rate is not the same as bit rate because one sym-
bol may carry more than 1 bit of data. Sometimes many symbols are used to
convey 1 bit of data.
beacon
An active RFID tag that is programmed to wake up and broadcast its
signal at a set interval.
bistatic reader
An interrogator that uses two antennas to interrogate the
tags: one to transmit the signal and another to receive. The two antennas, trans-
mit (Tx) and receive (Rx), form one interrogation port. An interrogator may
have one or more such ports.
BNC connector
A male type of connector used with coaxial cables. It has a
center pin connected to the center conductor and a metal tube connected to the
outer cable shield. An outer rotating ring is used to lock the cable to a female
connector.It was named after its bayonet mount locking mechanism and its two
inventors Neill and Concelman. Over the years it has picked up other names
such as bayonet navy connector, baby N connector, barrel nut connector, bayo-
net nipple connector, British naval connector, and British national connector.
capacitor

pacitor usually consists of two metallic plates separated and insulated from each
other by a dielectric substance.
card operating system
The software program stored in the smart card IC
that manages the basic functions of the card, such as communication with the
terminal, security management, and data management in the smart card file
system.
carrier frequency
The base or central frequency of a sinusoidal wave used to
carry (transmit) information using radio waves, electric current through wires,
or light waves through optical fibers. This frequency is modulated by varying its
amplitude, frequency, or phase to carry information.
checksum
A code added to the contents of a block of data stored on an RFID
integrated circuit that can be checked before and after data is transmitted from
the tag to the reader to determine whether the data has been corrupted or lost.
The cyclic redundancy check is one form of checksum.

chip
See integrated circuit (IC).
chipless RFID tag
A chipless RFID tag (also known as RF fibers) does not use
an integrated circuit to store information. The tag uses fibers or materials that
reflect a portion of the reader’s signal back; the unique return signal can be used
as an identifier.The fibers are shaped as thin threads,fine wires,or labels or lam-
inates. Chipless RFID tags can be used in environments that differ from those
with RFID tags with electronic circuitry. They tend to work over a wider tem-
perature range, and they are less sensitive to RF interference. Chipless tags are
sometimes used in anti-counterfeiting with documents. However, since the tags
cannot transmit a unique serial number,they are less usable in the supply chain.
circularly-polarized antenna
An antenna whose plane of polarization ro-
tates in a circle,making one revolution during the time it takes the radio wave to
travel the distance of one wavelength. If the rotation is clockwise, looking in the
direction of propagation of wave,the sense is called right-hand-circular (RHC).
If the rotation is counterclockwise, the sense is called left-hand-circular (LHC).
These antennas are used when the orientation of the tag to the reader cannot be
controlled. They provide shorter read range than the linearly polarized antenna
because only half the radio energy is transmitted in any one plane at a time.
closed-loop systems
RFID control systems in which the tracked objects
never leave the company or organization; the objects either stay within one or-
ganization or circulate among a small known group of organizations. All the
data related to the object is usually stored in one place, so the complete history
of the object is readily available. The usual concerns about RFID standards do
not apply,since the tracked object does not leave the system. This type of system
is somewhat easier to implement because of the controlled set of variables. Al-
though closed-loop systems may be implemented without concerns for RFID
standards, it is a good practice to follow prevailing industry standards in system
design.
collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment
A general term used
to describe cooperation between manufacturers and retailers to match supply of
goods with demand for them.
commissioning a tag
The process of writing data to the tag for the first time.
The data may include only an identifying number or a number and other infor-
mation and may be written to a tag during tag manufacturing or when the tag is
attached to the object. In most RFID systems, this data is associated with infor-
mation about the object stored in the database.

compatibility
Two systems are considered compatible if they are equal in in-
terface specifications, such as protocols, frequencies, and voltage levels, and are
thus able to operate together. (See interoperability.)
concentrator
A device connected to several RFID readers that gathers data
from the readers. It performs some filtering and then passes on only useful in-
formation from the readers to a host computer.
contactless credit card
Unlike an ordinary credit card, a contactless credit
card uses RFID technology to store information about an account and to trans-
fer it to the merchant. Standard credit cards carry data on a magnetic strip;
when the card is swiped against a reader,the data is transferred.The primary ad-
vantage of contactless cards lies in the speed of the transaction.
coupling
See inductive coupling.
cyclic redundancy check (CRC)
A method of checking data stored on an
RFID tag to be sure that it hasn’t been corrupted or lost. (See checksum.)
data carrier
A medium that is capable of holding data, such as RFID tags,
barcodes, and magnetic strips.

stored in a data field from being overwritten.
data transfer rate
The number of bits or bytes of data that can be transferred
between an RFID tag and a reader per unit of time.
dB
See decibel.
dBm
Unit of power specified in decibel relative to 1 milliwatt.
dead tag
An RFID tag that cannot be read by an RFID reader due to a fault in
the tag.

MIKE MEYERS’ COMPTIA RFID+ CERTIFICATION PASSPORT

detune
When RFID tags are attached to a conductive material or are in the vi-
cinity of such material, the property of the antenna on the tag changes. This
causes the antenna to be tuned to a different frequency than the intended design
frequency. The antenna is said to be detuned from its intended frequency.
die
Silicon disk on which integrated circuits are created.
dielectric
A material that is a poor conductor of electricity, but an efficient
supporter of electrostatic fields. Some examples of dielectric include porcelain
(ceramic), mica, glass, plastics, oxides of various metals, dry air, and distilled
water.Dielectrics are used in RF transmission lines.In a coaxial cable,polyethyl-
ene, a dielectric, is used between the center conductor and outside shield.
dielectric constant
Also called relative permittivity. A number that relates the
ability of a material to carry alternating current to the ability of a vacuum to carry
the same.The dielectric constant of a material affects how electromagnetic signals
(light,radio waves) move through the material.A high dielectric constant detunes
an RFID antenna and reduces the performance of an RFID tag.
digital certificate
An attachment to an electronic message used for security
purposes. It verifies the authenticity of a user sending a message and provides
the receiver with the means to encode a reply. An individual wishing to send an
encrypted message applies for a digital certificate from a certificate authority,
which issues an encrypted certificate containing the applicant’s public key and a
variety of other identification information.
digital signal processor (DSP)
A specialized microprocessor designed spe-
cifically for digital signal processing. It is used in RFID readers.
digital signature
An electronic signature that can be used to authenticate the
identity of the sender of a message or the signer of a document.It also ensures that
the original content of the message or document that has been sent is unchanged.
dipole
An antenna made of a straight electrical conductor measuring half the
wavelength from end to end and connected at the center to an RF feed line. This
is the basic and simplest practical antenna and has gain of 2.2 dBi. It is fre-
quently used as a base to compare other antennas. Most UHF and microwave
tags have dipole antenna connected to an integrated circuit.

mum allowable power from an antenna.It is sometimes referred to as equivalent
isotropically radiated power.
effective radiated power (ERP)
The power necessary at the input terminals
of a reference half-wave dipole antenna to produce the same maximum field in-
tensity. It is a product of the power supplied to the antenna and antenna gain
