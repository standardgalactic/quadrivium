Variables in Go
●
A variable is a name for a memory location where a value of a speciﬁc type is stored. 
●
In Go a variable belongs and it’s created at runtime.
●
A declared variable must be used or we get an error! 
●
_ is the blank identiﬁer and mutes the compile-time error returned by unused variables. 
Declaring variables:
1. Using the var keyword
      var x int = 7
var s1 string
        s1 = "Learning Go!"
2. Using the Short Declaration Operator (:=)
age := 30
