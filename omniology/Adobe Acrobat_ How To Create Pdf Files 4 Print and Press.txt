Welcome to Adobe’s How to Create 
Adobe PDF Files for Print and Press 
book, a step-by-step guide that covers 
the basics of creating Adobe Portable 
Document Format (PDF) files for 
prepress and print workflows. This 
book tells you how you can use Adobe 
Acrobat 4.0 software to easily convert 
any document created in your favorite 
page-layout or illustration application 
to a PDF file and then distribute that file 
to a prepress provider or service bureau 
for high-quality publishing. Also, with 
the new annotation features in Acrobat 
4.0 software, you can streamline the 
internal and external review processes 
by allowing reviewers and clients to 
make extensive remarks directly on 
your PDF comps.
Benefits of PDF
One of the greatest challenges facing 
anyone in professional publishing 
today is the complexity of the printing 
workflow itself. Between the time you 
create a document and send it off to 
your print shop, there are a number of 
steps that take place before your work 
actually gets printed.
Introducing PDF to your workflow can 
streamline your printing process. Based 
on the PostScript imaging model, PDF 
is a flexible, cross-platform, cross-
application file format that accurately 
displays and preserves fonts, page lay-
outs, and other graphical elements in a 
document. PDF offers unique benefits 
for both document creators and pro-
fessional print producers throughout 
the entire workflow. 
PDF offers many benefits:
• PDF files are small and self-
contained.
• Fonts, images, and graphics are 
embedded within a PDF document, 
streamlining electronic transmission 
and preflighting.
• PDF files are independent of the 
platform, operating system, and 
authoring application and are 
viewable onscreen in Macintosh, 
Windows, and UNIX® environments.
INTRODUCTION

• One consistent, predictable, reliable 
format can be used for all documents.
• PDF files are ideal for archival and 
retrieval.
When producing PDF files, you can 
choose to create either pre-separated 
or composite PDFs. Working with 
composite PDF files gives you advan-
tages over pre-separated files, including 
the ability to soft proof or view the file 
and make simple last-minute changes 
to text and graphics prior to final 
output. In addition, a reduced file 
size makes file transfer over a network 
much faster.
About this book
In How to Create Adobe PDF Files 
for Print and Press, you’ll find the 
basic procedures and techniques you 
need to create PDF files for high-qual-
ity output, including how to:
• Set up your printing environment to 
create high-quality PDF files. 
• Create a clean PostScript file 
from any application, with specific 
instructions on how to create a 
PDF file using the Macintosh and 
Windows versions of Adobe Frame-
Maker, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe 
InDesign, Adobe PageMaker Plus, 
Macromedia FreeHand, and 
QuarkXPress.
INTRODUCTION
• Create print- and press-optimized 
PDF files using Adobe Acrobat 4.0 
software. 
• Streamline internal and external 
review by allowing reviewers to make 
extensive remarks directly on PDF 
comps. Editors and clients can add 
sticky notes, stamps, and handwritten 
comments, and they can use highlight, 
strikethrough, and underline tools to 
mark up text.
In addition to these steps, you’ll find 
more information on advanced tech-
niques and specific workflow issues in 
the appendixes. Even if you’ve used 
Adobe Acrobat software before, we rec-
ommend you start at Step 1, “Setup,” 
before beginning any of the other steps.

digital devices and imagesetters or 
platesetters, you will need to do 
the following:
1. Set up your AdobePS printer driver
and Acrobat 4 (Step 1).
2. Choose specific options for the 
creation of PDF files within the origi-
nating application and create quality 
PDF files (Step 2).
3. Review and mark-up your PDF files 
(Step 3).
4. Preflight and print your PDF files 
(Step 4).

Setting Acrobat Distiller options
Acrobat Distiller converts PostScript 
files to PDF files. You must run Dis-
tiller to convert the PostScript files you 
generate. You can set default Acrobat 
Distiller options before you begin cre-
ating PDF files, or you can set options 
whenever you convert a PostScript file 
into a PDF file. Acrobat Distiller offers 
three default settings:
• The ScreenOptimized job options are 
recommended for files that will be 
displayed on the World Wide Web 
or an intranet.
• The PrintOptimized job options
are recommended for PDF files that
are intended for desktop printers,
digital copiers, publishing on a 
CD-ROM, or to send to a client as 
a publishing proof.
• The PressOptimized job options are 
suggested for PDF files that will be 
printed as high-quality final output 
to an imagesetter or platesetter, for 
example.
To set Distiller defaults:
1. Launch Acrobat Distiller.
2. Click the Job Options pop-up menu, 
and then select the appropriate option 
(PressOptimized, PrintOptimized, or 
ScreenOptimized) or create your own 
Distiller settings and save the Job 
Options with a unique name.
3. Quit Acrobat Distiller.
Acrobat Distiller will retain the default 
settings until you change them. 
The Acrobat application requires 
17MB of RAM; Acrobat Distiller 
requires 12MB. Make sure that your 
computer has sufficient RAM to run 
these applications. 
The instructions in Step 2 of this book 
explain how to create PostScript files 
from within several applications. The 
instructions in Step 3 of this booklet 
explain how to convert PostScript files 
into PDF files.
Note: You cannot modify the three pre-
defined sets of Distiller job options. How-
ever, you can create new sets based on the 
default sets, or you can define and save 
custom sets of options and use them at 
any time.
Before creating a PDF file to send to a 
commercial printer or a service bureau, 
check with the provider to find out 
what the output resolution and other 
settings should be, or ask them to pro-
vide a joboptions file containing their 
recommended settings. You may need 
to customize the job options for a par-
ticular provider and then provide them 
with a joboptions file of your own.

Step 2 
Setting up your applications
Before you start, read this section.
This section describes the basic tech-
niques you will follow to output PDF 
files directly from an application or to 
generate PostScript files and convert 
them into PDF files. Specifying the 
correct output settings is an impor-
tant step because the content in the 
PostScript files you generate deter-
mines the data that appears in your 
PDF file. For example, if you forget to 
include a font in your PostScript file, it 
will not appear in your PDF file.
In this section of How to Create 
Adobe PDF Files for Print and Press, 
you will find basic step-by-step 
instructions on how to create a PDF 
file designed for a composite PDF 
workflow. For more advanced tech-
niques, such as trapping and OPI, see 
Appendix A.
Before you begin, make sure you have 
installed Acrobat 4.0. you may also 
want to set up your Acrobat Distiller 
functions before creating a PostScript 
file from your application. To do so, 
see Step 1 in this book.

In addition to creating a PostScript file 
and using Distiller, you can generate 
PDF files from individual FrameMaker 
documents, as well as from Frame-
Maker books. When you generate a 
PDF version of a book, you can create 
either a single PDF file for the entire 
book or separate PDF files for each 
document in the book. You have two 
options for creating PDF files with 
FrameMaker: 1) you can use the Save 
As command (File menu) or; 2) you 
can use the Print command (File 
menu) and select Acrobat Distiller as 
the printer.
Creating a PDF file with 
FrameMaker’s Save As command
Note: Before you launch FrameMaker, 
make sure at least one PostScript printer 
is installed on your PC.
1. Open the document or book you 
want to convert to PDF. A book will be 
saved to a single PDF file.
2. If there are references to other 
FrameMaker documents that are in 
other books, also open the other book 
files. This ensures that links will work 
properly when all the books are con-
verted to PDF.
3. In the original document or book 
file, select File > Save As (or Save Book 
As), and then select PDF from the 
Format pop-up.
4. In the Save Document dialog box, 
add a .pdf extension to the original file-
name. You can also change the save 
location. Click Save. 
5. In the PDF Setup dialog box, select 
the Bookmarks tab, and then set up 
PDF bookmarks by doing the following:
• To indicate which paragraphs should 
be converted to PDF bookmarks, move 
paragraph tags between scroll lists. The 
paragraphs in the Include Paragraphs 
scroll list will have bookmarks in the 
PDF file. To move a tag between scroll 
lists, select the tag and click an arrow 
or double-click the tag. To move all 
the tags from one scroll list to the 
other, Shift-click an arrow. To omit 
bookmarks, turn off Generate PDF 
Bookmarks.
• To change bookmark levels for the 
included paragraphs, select a paragraph 
tag and click a Bookmark Level arrow. 
To change the level of all items, Shift-
click a Bookmark Level arrow. If the 
indent for a tag exceeds six levels, 
n> precedes the paragraph tag, where 
n is the indentation level of the 
paragraph tag.
• To include paragraph tags along with 
the paragraph text in the bookmarks, 
select Include Paragraph Tags in Book-
mark Text. Use this option to check the 
assigned levels of bookmarks in a draft 
of the PDF file. (Turn this option off 
when you print the final draft of the 
document.)
In the Save Document dialog box, select PDF from 
the Save As type pop-up
In the PDF Setup dialog box, select Bookmarks from 
the pop-up, and then set up PDF bookmarks

6. Set up article threading by doing one 
of the following:
• To have the reading order of each 
article follow the same order that the 
insertion point moves, select Articles 
and select Thread by Column from the 
pop-up. This setting is usually the most 
appropriate in multicolumn formats.
• To have the reading order of each 
article go from text frame to text frame, 
select Articles and select Thread by 
Text Frame from the pop-up. This set-
ting is usually the most appropriate in 
single-column formats.
• To create no article threads, turn off 
Article Threading.
7. If you’ll add links to this document 
from other documents after the PDF 
file is created, select the Links tab and 
turn on Create Named Destinations for 
All Paragraphs. Note that turning on 
this option increases the size of the 
PDF file.
8. To generate a logical PDF structure, 
select the Structure tab and turn on 
Generate Logical PDF Structure.
A logical PDF structure creates standard 
elements in the PDF, which can be 
read by other programs that need to 
read and/or analyze the PDF file. 
This option is not generally needed 
in files intended solely for prepress 
or printing. For more information 
on logical PDF structure, see Adobe 
Technical Note 5401, available from 
http://partners.adobe.com/asn/
developer/technotes.html#acrobat-pdf
If you select Generate Logical PDF 
Structure, you can select how each 
paragraph tag corresponds to a struc-
ture level by selecting a tag in the left 
scrolling list. Click the “<<” or “>>” 
buttons to change its structure level, 
and then click the middle “-->” button 
to add the paragraph tag to the list 
of tags that will be included in the 
PDF. For more information on this 
topic, see page 481 of the FrameMaker 
User Guide.
9. To add document information such 
as author’s name and keywords, select 
Document Info from the pop-up, and 
enter the appropriate information.
10. Click Set.
When you click Set, you are returned 
to your document while Acrobat Dis-
tiller runs in the background. The PDF 
file is placed in the folder you specified 
in step 4.
Creating a PDF file with 
FrameMaker’s Print command
To create a PDF file from a single 
FrameMaker document: 
1. Open the document you want to 
convert to PDF.
2. Select File > Print.

In addition to creating a PostScript file 
and using Distiller, you can generate 
PDF files from individual FrameMaker 
documents, as well as from Frame-
Maker books. When you generate a 
PDF version of a book, you can create 
either a single PDF file for the entire 
book or separate PDF files for each 
document in the book. You have two 
options for creating PDF files with 
FrameMaker: 1) you can use the Save 
As command (File menu) or; 2) you 
can use the Print command (File 
menu) and select Create Adobe PDF 
as the printer.
Creating a PDF file with 
FrameMaker’s Save As command
Note: Before you launch FrameMaker, 
make sure at least one PostScript printer 
is installed on your Macintosh.
1. Open the document or book you 
want to convert to PDF. A book will be 
saved to a single PDF file.
2. If there are references to other 
FrameMaker documents that are in 
other books, also open the other book 
files. This ensures that links will work 
properly when all the books are con-
verted to PDF.
3. In the original document or book 
file, select File > Save As (or Save Book 
As), and then select PDF from the 
Format pop-up.
4. In the Save Document dialog box, 
add a .pdf extension to the original file 
name (but don’t change the file name 
beyond that). You can also change the 
save location. Click Save.
5. In the PDF Setup dialog box, select 
Bookmarks from the pop-up, and then 
set up PDF bookmarks by doing the 
following:
• To indicate which paragraphs should 
be converted to PDF bookmarks, move 
paragraph tags between scroll lists. The 
paragraphs in the Include Paragraphs 
scroll list will have bookmarks in the 
PDF file. To move a tag between scroll 
lists, select the tag and click an arrow 
or double-click the tag. To move all 
the tags from one scroll list to the 
other, Shift-click an arrow. To omit 
bookmarks, turn off Generate PDF 
Bookmarks.
• To change bookmark levels for the 
included paragraphs, select a para-
graph tag and click a Bookmark Level 
arrow. To change the level of all items, 
Shift-click a Bookmark Level arrow. 
If the indent for a tag exceeds six levels, 
n> precedes the paragraph tag, where 
n is the indentation level of the para-
graph tag.
•  To include paragraph tags along with 
the paragraph text in the bookmarks, 
select Include Paragraph Tags in Book-
mark Text. Use this option to check the 
assigned levels of bookmarks in a draft 
of the PDF file. (Turn this option off 
when you print the final draft of the 
document.)

Note: If Include Paragraph Tags in 
Bookmark Text is on, the actual style 
names of the tags get put in the book-
marks, along with the text that has been 
tagged. So a bookmark in the “report.fm” 
demo file might say “CellHeading - 
Dosage” instead of just “Dosage”
6. Set up article threading by doing one 
of the following:
• To have the reading order of each 
article follow the same order that the 
insertion point moves, select Articles 
and select Thread by Column from the 
pop-up. This setting is usually the most 
appropriate in multicolumn formats.
• To have the reading order of each 
article go from text frame to text frame, 
select Articles and select Thread by 
Text Frame from the pop-up. This 
setting is usually the most appropriate 
in single-column formats.
• To create no article threads, turn off 
Article Threading.
7. To generate a logical PDF structure, 
select Structure from the pop-up and 
turn on Generate Logical PDF Structure. 
• A logical PDF structure creates 
standard elements in the PDF, which 
can be read by other programs that 
need to read and/or analyze the PDF 
file. This option is not generally 
needed in files intended solely for 
prepress or printing. For more infor-
mation on logical PDF structure,

In addition to creating a PostScript 
file and using Distiller, you have two 
options for creating PDF files with 
Illustrator: 1) you can use the Save As 
command (File menu) or; 2) you can 
use the Print command (File menu) 
and select Acrobat Distiller as the 
printer.
Creating a PDF file with Illustrator’s 
Save As command
Note: Before you launch Illustrator, 
make sure at least one PostScript printer 
is installed on your PC.
1. Open the illustration you want to 
convert to PDF.
2. Chose File > Save As.
3. In the Save dialog box, select the 
folder where you want to save the file 
and enter a name for the file. 
4. Select Adobe PDF from the Save as 
Type pop-up, and then click Save.
5. In the Adobe PDF Format Options 
dialog box, select from the following 
options in the Options Set menu:
• Select the Default option to use the 
default PDF general settings and com-
pression settings. 
• Select Screen-Optimized to use 
default settings appropriate for use on 
the Web. When selecting Screen-Opti-
mized, the file is automatically con-
verted to the RGB color mode. 
• Ensure that Custom is selected when 
creating your own customized general 
settings and compression settings. 
6. In the Adobe PDF Format Options 
dialog box, select General from the 
pop-up below the Option Set pop-up 
and then select from the following 
options:
• Select either Acrobat 5.0 or 4.0 in the 
File Compatibility panel. Transparent 
artwork will be preserved only when 
saving in the Acrobat 5.0 format. 
• Select Preserve Illustrator Editing 
Capabilities to export the file in an 
Acrobat PDF format that allows you 
to reopen and edit the file in Adobe 
Illustrator. 
• Select the Embed All Fonts option 
to save the fonts used in the file with 
the saved file. Protected Japanese fonts 
cannot be embedded in the file. 
Note: It is important to include all fonts 
when you create a PDF file. This helps 
avoid missing fonts if you send your files 
to a service bureau.
• Select the Subset fonts when less 
than _ % of the characters are used 
option to minimize the PDF file size 
by embedding only those characters of 
the font that are used in the docu-
ment—that is, a subset of the font. 
This option is available when you select 
Embed All Fonts. Type the character 
threshold that determines when a font 
subset is created. If the percentage 
of characters used in the document 
exceeds this setting, then the entire font 
is embedded in the file rather than a 
subset of the font.

box will be disabled.
• Select the Generate Thumbnails 
option to save a thumbnail image of 
the artwork with the saved file.
7. In the Adobe PDF Format Options 
dialog box, select Compression from 
the pop-up below the Options Set 
pop-up. Then select from the following 
options:
• Select the Average Downsampling at 
_ dpi option in any of the compression 
panels if you want to set downsampling 
for the PDF file. Downsampling is a 
technique whereby information repre-
sented by several pixels in a bitmap 
is combined to make a larger pixel. 
Downsampling reduces the resolution 
of the image to the specified dpi setting 
by choosing a pixel in the center of the 
sample area and replacing the area with 
a pixel of the averaged color. 
• Select a compression method for the 
PDF file:
Automatic The Automatic option 
automatically lets Illustrator set the 
best possible compression and quality 
for the artwork contained in the file. 
For most files, this option produces 
satisfactory results.
ZIP ZIP is a compression method that 
works well on images with large areas 
of single colors or repeating patterns 
and for black-and-white images that 
contain repeating patterns. Illustrator 
provides 4-bit and 8-bit ZIP compres-
sion options. If you use 4-bit ZIP 
compression with 4-bit images, or 8-bit 
ZIP compression with 4-bit or 8-bit 
images, the ZIP method is lossless; 
that is, data is not removed to reduce 
file size and so image quality is not 
affected. Using 4-bit ZIP compression 
with 8-bit data can affect the quality, 
however, because data is lost. 
JPEG The JPEG compression method 
is suitable for grayscale or color images. 
JPEG is lossy, which means that it 
removes image data and may reduce 
image quality; however, it attempts to 
reduce file size with a minimum loss of 
information. Because JPEG eliminates 
data, it can achieve much smaller file 
sizes than ZIP.
CCITT The Consultative Committee 
on International Telephony and Teleg-
raphy (CCITT) compression method 
(only available when compressing as a 
monochrome bitmap image) is appro-
priate for black-and-white images and 
any images scanned with an image 
depth of 1 bit. CCITT is a lossless 
method. Illustrator provides CCITT

Group 3 and Group 4 compression 
options. Group 4 is a general-purpose 
method that produces good compres-
sion for most monochromatic images. 
Group 3, used by most fax machines, 
compresses monochromatic bitmaps 
one row at a time.
Note: The Consultative Committee on 
International Telegraphy and Telephony 
(CCITT) was renamed as the Inter-
national Telecommunications Union, 
Telecommunications Standard Sector 
(ITU-T); however the compression stan-
dard is still referred to as CCITT Group 
3 and Group 4. 
Run Length The Run Length option 
is a lossless encoding option that 
produces the best results for images 
that contain large areas of solid black 
or white.

Art option to apply the ZIP compres-
sion method (a lossless compression 
method) to all text and line art in 
the file.

• Select the “Subset Fonts When Less 
Than _ % of the Characters are Used” 
option to minimize the PDF file size 
by embedding only those characters of 
the font that are used in the docu-
ment—that is, a subset of the font. 
This option is available when you select 
Embed All Fonts. Type the character 
threshold that determines when a font 
subset is created. If the percentage 
of characters used in the document 
exceeds this setting, then the entire font 
is embedded in the file rather than a 
subset of the font. Setting subset at 
100% will create a unique name for 
each font embedded into the PDF. This 
can be valuable for print output as it 
requires the use of the unique font 
from the PDF file rather than from the 
operating system.
• Select the Embed ICC profile option 
to embed a color profile into the saved 
file. The color profile is determined 
in the Color Settings dialog box. This 
embedded color profile is then applied 
to the file when the file is reopened 
in Adobe Illustrator. This checkbox 
will be unavailable (as shown in this 
Figure) when no ICC profile has been 
assigned to the document.
• Select the Generate Thumbnails 
option to save a thumbnail image of 
the artwork with the saved file.
7. Select Compression from the 
pop-up below the Options Set pop-up. 
Then select from the following options:
• Select the Average Downsampling at 
_ dpi option in any of the compression 
panels if you want to set downsampling 
for the PDF file. Downsampling is a 
technique whereby information repre-
sented by several pixels in a bitmap 
is combined to make a larger pixel. 
Downsampling reduces the resolution 
of the image to the specified dpi setting 
by choosing a pixel in the center of the

pression with 4-bit images, or 8-bit 
ZIP compression with 4-bit or 8-bit 
images, the ZIP method is lossless; that 
is, data is not removed to reduce file

Using 4-bit ZIP compression with 8-bit 
data can affect the quality, however, 
because data is lost. 
JPEG The JPEG compression method 
is suitable for grayscale or color images. 
JPEG is lossy, which means that it 
removes image data and may reduce 
image quality when the compression is 
set high. However, JPEG attempts to

compute than downsampling, because 
it reduces image resolution by picking 
a single pixel in the center of a 
sampled area, whereas downsampling 
reduces the resolution by averaging 
the pixel color over the entire sample 
area. In general, PDF files intended for 
printing on high-resolution (1200 dpi 
and above) devices should not have 
their images resampled.

In Photoshop 5.5 you have three 
options from the File menu for 
creating PDF files: 
1. Save As command, select PDF from 
the file-type options.
2. Save As Single Image PDF. This 
option is used when working on a single 
image in Photoshop and saving it to 
PDF. This functionality is based pri-
marily on Acrobat’s ability to allow 
editing of an image in Photoshop by 
using the Touchup Object Tool and 
Control clicking on an image, which 
will open that image in Photoshop for 
editing. Once in Photoshop 5.5, you 
can just click Save and the altered image 
will automatically update into the Acro-
bat file. You can also use the Save As 
Single Image PDF to rename the image 
and save it into a new PDF file.
3. Print command, select Create Adobe 
PDF as the printer.
In Photoshop 6.0 you have two options 
from the File menu for creating PDF 
files:
1. Save As command, select PDF 
from the file-type options. Note that 
Photoshop 6.0 can include vector 
images, which will be saved into 
the PDF.
2. Print command and select Create 
Adobe PDF as the printer.
Note: The Save As Single Image PDF 
option is not available as a File menu 
option in Photoshop 6. It is only avail-
able in Photoshop 6 when editing an 
image from Acrobat using the Touchup 
Object Tool and Control clicking on 
an image, which will open that image 
in Photoshop for editing. Save As will 
provide a temporary file name and an 
Acrobat Touchup Image file type, which 
is the same as Save As Single Image PDF.
Creating a PDF file with 
Photoshop’s Save As command
Note: Before you launch Photoshop, 
make sure at least one PostScript printer 
is installed on your PC.

to PDF.
2. Select File > Save As.
3. In the Save As dialog box, select the 
folder where you want to save the file 
and enter a name for the file. 
4. Select Photoshop PDF from the Save 
As pop-up menu, and then click Save.
Note: If PDF isn’t an option in the Save 
dialog, it’s possible the image needs to be 
flattened.
In the Save As dialog box (Photoshop 5.5), select 
Photoshop PDF from the Save As pop-up
From Acrobat 4, you can use the Object 
Touchup Tool to open images in Photoshop. 
Hold down the Ctrl key and double-click 
an image in a PDF file – that image will 
then open into Photoshop. Make changes 
to the image and click Save – the image will 
be updated in your PDF file. If you choose 
to Save As, the window above will appear, 
giving you an option to Save the image. 
This is where there is a difference between 
Photoshop 5.5 and 6.0. Photoshop 5.5 pro-
vides a Save As choice for Save as Single 
Image PDF. Photoshop 6 calls this Save As 
option Touchup Image and provides a temp 
file for a name. Both versions of Photoshop 
are doing the same thing - saving the 
altered image back to your PDF file.

select the type of compression you 
want to apply from the Encoding 
pop-up menu. If you select JPEG 
encoding, enter a value in the Quality 
field, select an option from the accom-
panying pop-up menu, or use the slider 
to specify the amount of compression. 
The higher the quality, the larger the 
file size of the PDF will be.
6. Click OK.
When you click OK, Photoshop saves 
the image into Photoshop PDF format. 
While this is an Adobe PDF file, rec-
ognize that it is a Photoshop PDF 
and when double-clicked will open in 
Photoshop. Using the Print to PDF 
options discussed below will create a 
stand-alone PDF – not associated with 
Photoshop. Another important differ-
ence is that with Save As, the PDF page 
size is the size of the Photoshop doc-
ument, whereas with Print, the PDF 
page size is the paper size selected in 
the Page Setup dialog.
Creating a PDF file with 
Photoshop’s Print command
1. Open the image you want to convert 
to PDF.
2. Select File > Print.
3. Check to see if the printer listed next

dialog box.
Note: The Acrobat Distiller printer 
choice only exists if you’ve previously 
installed the Adobe driver with the 
Acrobat PPD, and set it up so it prints 
to a file.
4. Select Binary from the Encoding 
pop-up, select CMYK Color from the 
space pop-up. This setting is for color 
print separation output. 
5. Enter a Print Quality value, typically 
600 - 1200 dpi for print-optimized, 
2400 dpi for press-optimized.
6. Click OK, name the PDF file and 
Click Save.
Acrobat Distiller runs in the back-
ground to create the PDF file.

ADOBE PHOTOSHOP  5.5 & 6.0
Adobe Photoshop 5.5 & 6.0
In Photoshop 5.5 you have three 
options from the File menu for 
creating PDF files: 
1. Save As command, select PDF from 
the file-type options.
2. Save As Single Image PDF. This 
option is used when working on a 
single image in Photoshop and saving 
it to PDF. This functionality is based 
primarily on Acrobat’s ability to allow 
editing of an image in Photoshop by 
using the Touchup Object Tool and 
Option clicking on an image, which 
will open that image in Photoshop 
for editing. Once in Photoshop 5.5, 
you can just click Save and the altered 
image will automatically update into 
the Acrobat file. You can also use the 
Save As Single Image PDF to rename 
the image and save it into a new 
PDF file.
3. Print command, select Create Adobe 
PDF as the printer.
In Photoshop 6.0 you have two options 
from the File menu for creating 
PDF files:
1. Save As command, select PDF 
from the file-type options. Note that 
Photoshop 6.0 can include vector 
images, which will be saved into 
the PDF.
2. Print command and select Create 
Adobe PDF as the printer.
Note: The Save As Single Image PDF 
option is not available as a File menu 
option in Photoshop 6. It is only avail-
able in Photoshop 6 when editing an 
image from Acrobat using the Touchup 
Object Tool and Option clicking on 
an image, which will open that image 
in Photoshop for editing. Save As will 
provide a temporary file name and an 
Acrobat Touchup Image file type, which 
is the same as Save As Single Image PDF.
Creating a PDF file with 
Photoshop’s Save As command
1. Open the image you want to convert 
to PDF.
2. Select File > Save As.
3. Select the folder where you want 
to save the file and enter a name for 
the file. 
Choose a storage folder, specify a name, and Select 
Photoshop PDF from the Format pop-up
From Acrobat 4, you can use the Object Touchup 
Tool to open images in Photoshop. Hold down the 
Option key and double-click an image in a PDF file 
– that image will then open into Photoshop. Make 
changes to the image and click Save – the image 
will be updated in your PDF file. If you choose to 
Save As, the window above will appear, giving you 
an option to Save the image. This is where there 
is a difference between Photoshop 5.5 and 6.0. 
Photoshop 5.5 provides a Save As choice for Save 
as Single Image PDF. Photoshop 6 calls this Save 
As option Touchup Image and provides a temp file 
for a name. Both versions of Photoshop are doing 
the same thing – saving the altered image back to 
your PDF file.

menu) or; 2) you can use the Print 
command (File menu) and select 
Acrobat Distiller as the printer. (The 
Export As PDF command is available 
only if the PDF Filter XTension is 
installed.)
Note: At the time of this publication, 
QuarkXPress 4.11 was the most current 
version for Windows. You can download 
the 4.11 update from Quark’s Web 
site (www.quark.com). You should also 
download and install the “4.11fixit” 
XTension (also available from 
www.quark.com) which fixes problems 
with image files and OPI in QuarkX-
Press 4.11.
Creating a PDF file with 
QuarkXPress’ Export As 
PDF command
Before you use the Export As PDF 
command, you must configure a 
PostScript printer to print to a file. 
Also, you may want to set up PDF 
export settings in the PDF Export 
Preferences dialog. To do so, select 
Edit > Preferences > PDF Export. 
Note that these Preferences are local to 
EACH document; they’re not a global 
setting for QuarkXPress. So if you change 
the Compression under Job Options for a 
file, you have to do it again for the next 
file you make a PDF from.
To create a PDF file with the Export As 
PDF command:
1. Open the document you want to 
convert to PDF.
2. Select Utilities > Export as PDF. 
If prompted, locate Acrobat Distiller.
3. In the Export As PDF dialog box, 
select a storage folder and assign a 
name to the PDF file.
4. If you want to modify any of the 
default PDF export settings, click Pref-
erences. When you finish modifying 
export settings, click OK. The “default” 
settings are the ones you set earlier in 
the PDF Export Preferences dialog.
5. Select PDF from the Save as Type 
pop-up, and then click Save. 
Note: Selecting PDF (*.pdf) as the file 
type does two things:
1. Affects which files are shown in the 
scrolling file list – only .pdf files are 
shown.
Before exporting a PDF file, you can set up custom 
Distiller options in the PDF Export Preferences 
dialog box

the file to PDF. Unlike most other 
Windows programs discussed in this 
document, QuarkXPress runs Distiller 
in the foreground, not in the background.
6. When you click Save, Acrobat 
Distiller generates a PDF file and 
places it in the folder you specified 
in step 3. You are then returned to 
your document.

option on or off. Use the Output tab 
to select print color and set resolution. 
Use the Options tab to select settings, 
such as Print Colors, which should be 
set to Composite CMYK.
4. Click Setup, and then select Acrobat 
Distiller from the Printer Description 
pop-up menu. 
This tab lets you select any of several 
predefined paper sizes or specify a 
custom paper size. If you select Custom 
from the Paper Size pop-up menu, you 
can specify the width and height of the 
paper in the Paper Width and Paper 
Height fields, respectively, or you can 
let QuarkXPress determine the paper 
height by choosing Automatic.
If your page is wider than it is tall, 
select the landscape icon next to Orien-
tation. To see how the size of the cur-
rent document relates to the specified 
paper size, click the Preview tab.
5. Select Output, and then select a 
resolution: 
• Select 1200 dpi if you want to produce 
a print-optimized PDF file that will be 
output to a color printer or a digital 
color copier. (The Distiller PrintOpti-
mized job option also uses a resolution 
of 1200 dpi.)
• Select 2400 dpi if you want to pro-
duce a press-optimized PDF file that 
will be output on a printing press or 
plotter. (The Distiller PressOptimized 
job option also uses a resolution of 
2400 dpi.)
6. When you have selected all of your 
settings in each tab, click Print. 
When you click Print, Acrobat Distiller 
runs in the foreground and places the 
PDF file in the PDF Output folder

Step 3 
Streamline your review and markup 
Before you start, read this section.
This section describes how you can 
use the Adobe Acrobat 4.0 appli-
cation to review and mark up PDF 
files being routed for editorial or 
design review, before they’re sent 
to a printer, to create thumbnails 
that make it easy to preview longer 
documents, to create bookmarks to 
easily navigate your documents, and 
to create digital signatures to protect 
sensitive information.
Acrobat 4.0 includes several tools that 
let reviewers add different kinds of 
annotations to PDF documents. For 
example, a client could use Acrobat to 
add comments and mark corrections 
when proofing a publication before 
final output. Clients don’t need the 
original authoring application, and 
the annotations they insert don’t 
affect the original content. 
Note: Once you’ve created a PDF file, 
anyone with a Macintosh, Windows, or 
UNIX computer can open, display, and 
print the file using the free Acrobat 
Reader application. Acrobat 4.0 soft-
ware is required if you want to add 
annotations and markup or otherwise 
modify a PDF document.

Using electronic annotation tools 
for internal and external review
After you’ve converted a document 
into a print- or press-optimized PDF 
file, the file is ready to be printed—to a 
black-and-white or color laser printer, 
inkjet printer, or digital copier if it’s 
a print-optimized file, or to a high 
resolution imagesetter or platesetter 
if it’s a press-optimized file. But a 
PDF file doesn’t have to be sent 
straight to a printer. Reviewers can 
use Acrobat software’s versatile anno-
tation and markup tools to add 
such things as electronic sticky notes 
and handwritten copyedits to PDF 
documents, and they can add their 
comments directly on the PDF docu-
ments without modifying the originals.
Annotating and marking up PDF 
documents
Before Acrobat software, the client 
review process could be long and prob-
lematic. Comps and prepress proofs 
were sent by costly express mail or 
courier service. If you really wanted 
to ensure safe delivery, you probably 
delivered them to your client person-
ally. If you were confident enough to 
send a comp on disk, you had to make 
sure your client had all the fonts and 
graphics used in the document, as well 
as the correct version of the file and 
authoring application. And there was 
still no guarantee the client would see 
the document as you intended. Acro-
bat has changed all of that with the 
single-file convenience of PDF. Now, 
e-mailing a PDF digital master to cli-
ents is a widely accepted improvement 
to the client review process. You can 
save time and money associated with 
traditional forms of delivery, and you 
can be sure your client sees your docu-
ment exactly the way you designed it, 
with the layout, fonts, and graphical 
elements intact.
The annotation and markup features in 
Acrobat 4.0 streamline both the inter-
nal and external review and approval 
processes. Reviewers can make exten-
sive remarks directly on your PDF 
comps. 
Annotation tools
With Adobe Acrobat, you can elec-
tronically apply comments — such 
as electronic “sticky notes,” highlights, 
strikethroughs, and digital stamps — 
to your Adobe PDF documents. Elec-
tronic annotations are a great way to 
share comments because they’re part of 
the Adobe PDF file and travel with it.

The Notes tool  
 lets you add elec-
tronic notes to any page in an Adobe 
PDF document. Users can open and 
close, move, resize, and scroll a Note 
window, which enables reviewers to 
write extensive editorial or design com-
ments in legible text. These electronic 
sticky notes are ideal for making 
extensive, content-oriented annota-
tions. They can be sorted, imported, 
exported, deleted, and summarized for 
at-a-glance review.
The name and color of a note can 
be modified by clicking on a Note 
and selecting Edit > Properties. Rout-
ing a file for edits may result in multi-
ple people adding notes. Each person’s 
notes are easily identifiable by their 
name and/or color.
To add a note:
1. Select the Notes tool from the 
Tool bar.
2. Click where you want to place 
the note.
3. Enter your comment on the 
notepad.
You can click the note window’s close 
box after you’ve entered your comment. 
To delete a note, click on it and then 
choose Edit > Clear or press the Delete 
key (Macintosh) or the Backspace key 
(Windows).
Like the Notes tool, the Text Anno-
tation tool  
 lets you create a text 
annotation on any page in a PDF 
document and then place it anywhere 
you want. Unlike a note annotation, 
a text annotation remains visible on 
top of a page and cannot be closed. 
You can specify the font, size, and color 
of a text annotation, and you have 
the option of adding a border and a 
background color to the text field.
To add a text annotation:
1. Select the Text Annotation tool from 
the Tool bar by clicking and holding on 
the Note icon, and selecting the Text 
Annotation icon.
2. Click and drag a rectangle where you 
want to place the note.
3. Enter your comment.
4. After you’ve entered your comment, 
click outside the rectangle.
You can change the font, color, size of 
a text annotation. To do so, click on a 
text annotation and then choose Edit > 
Properties. To delete a text annotation, 
click on it and then choose Edit > Clear 
or press the Delete key (Macintosh) or 
the Backspace key (Windows).

The Audio Annotation  
 tool lets 
you record and attach verbal com-
ments to an Adobe PDF document. 
You must have a microphone attached 
to the audio port of your computer to 
record an audio annotation, and your 
computer must have a sound card to 
play them.
To add an audio annotation:
1. Select the Audio Annotation tool 
from the Tool bar.
2. Click where you want to place the 
audio annotation.
3. Click Record in the Audio Anno-
tation dialog box and speak into the 
microphone.
4. Click Stop when you’re done 
speaking.
You can change the color and author 
of an audio annotation and add a 
description. To do so, click on an audio 
annotation and then choose Edit > 
Properties. To delete an audio annota-
tion, click on it and then choose Edit 
> Clear or press the Delete key (Macin-
tosh) or the Backspace key (Windows).
Note (Macintosh): If you are unable to 
record sound for an audio annotation, 
open the Sound control panel and make 
sure that Built In and External Mic are 
selected in the Input pane. 
The Stamp tool  
 allows you to 
apply a graphic stamp to a document 
in much the same way you would 
use a rubber stamp on a paper docu-
ment. Acrobat includes several built-in 
stamp designs, such as “Approved,” 
and “Draft,” and you can create and 
add your own stamps, such as happy 
faces, to the selection list. After you add 
a stamp to a page, you have the option 
to associate a note with it.
To stamp a document:
1. Select the Stamp tool from the 
Tool bar.
2. Click where you want to place 
the stamp.
To change a stamp’s graphic, click on it 
and then choose Edit > Properties. To 
add a note to a stamp, double-click on 
it. To delete a stamp, click on it and 
then choose Edit > Clear or press the 
Delete key (Macintosh) or the Back-
space key (Windows).
The File Annotation tool  
 lets you 
embed a file at a selected location in 
a PDF document, so the reader can 
open it for viewing. Rather than ref-
erencing the file, as you would with 
a link, the file becomes part of the 
PDF document. Thus, if you move 
the PDF document to a new location, 
the embedded file annotation automat-
ically goes with it.

tions palette to navigate from annota-
tion to annotation, to import, export, 
and delete annotations, and to search 
for keywords in annotations.
To use the Annotations palette:
1. Choose Window > Show Annota-

of the Annotations palette to display 
the palette’s pop-up menu.
3. Choose Rescan Document from the 
pop-up menu.
4. To sort the annotations, choose 
Type, Author, Page Number, or Date 
from the pop-up menu.
Graphic and Text Markup tools
Adobe Acrobat offers two sets of 
markup tools—graphic and text—
that let you insert copyedits, add 
handwritten comments, draw 
attention to a portion of a page, and 
more. You can also add a note to a text 
or graphic markup, if you want.
The visual information you convey 
with a graphic annotation can be 
purely abstract or highly symbolic. For 
instance, you might draw an ellipse 
as an abstract representation of the 
workflow process and attach your 
comments about the workflow in an 
associated note. Or you might draw a 
rectangle that encloses a graphic and 
write your critique on the image in the 
associated note.
Graphic Markup tools
The Pencil tool  
 creates a freeform 
line. You can use this tool to add copy-
editing symbols, handwritten notes, or 
hand-drawn graphics.
To add a handwritten note/graphic:
1. Select the Pencil tool from the 
Tool bar.
2. Move the cursor to where you want 
to begin writing/drawing and then click 
and drag. You do not have to use one,

 creates a rectan-
gle you can position over text or graph-
ics. Select this tool and then click and 
drag to draw a rectangle. Double click 
inside the rectangle to reveal the notes 
attached to that rectangle.
The Ellipse tool  
 creates a circle you 
can position over text or graphics.

The Line tool  
 creates a straight line 
from two specified points.
To add a rectangle, ellipse, or line:
1. Select the appropriate tool from the 
Tool bar.
2. Move the cursor to where you want 
to place your graphic markup and then 
click and drag.
You can change the thickness, color, 
and author of a markup created with 
the Pencil tool. To do so, click on one 
of the markups and then choose Edit > 
Properties. 
Text Markup tools
The Text Markup tools provide several 
methods for visually marking up text in 
a document. You can use these annota-
tions by themselves or in conjunction 
with other annotation types. For exam-
ple, you may want to highlight or strike 
through a section of text, then double-
click on that highlight to add a Note 
window to explain your reason for 
the markup.
The Highlight Text tool  
 acts like 
a felt-tip highlighter pen and lets you 
draw attention to text by applying a 
highlight color of your choice.
The Strikethrough Text tool  
 draws a 
horizontal line through selected text—
handy for indicating text that needs 
to be deleted. Doubleclicking text with 
the strikeout markup also brings up a 
notes window to add your comments.
The Underline Text tool  
 adds a line 
under selected text and also includes 
a note for adding comments — just 
double click the underlined text.
To highlight, strike through, or 
underline text:
1. Select the appropriate tool from 
the Tool bar.
2. Move the cursor to the beginning of 
the text you want to mark up, drag, and 
then release the mouse button when 
the text is highlighted.
If you want, you can change the color 
and author of marked-up text. To do 
so, click on the text and then choose 
Edit > Properties. To add a note, 
double-click on the text. To remove 
the highlight, strikethrough, or under-
line applied to marked-up text, click 
on the marked-up text and then choose

Navigating Adobe PDF files using 
thumbnails and bookmarks
When you create Adobe PDF docu-
ments, it’s important to provide read-
ers with navigation tools that allow 
them to move quickly through the 
pages of a single document and 
among several documents. Two of 
Acrobat’s most useful navigation tools 
are thumbnails and bookmarks.
Thumbnails
Thumbnails display miniature pre-
views of the pages in an Adobe PDF 
document. When thumbnails are dis-
played, you can double-click on a page 
preview to display a particular page. 
To create thumbnails:
1. Choose Window > Show Thumbnails.
2. Choose Create All Thumbnails from 
the Thumbnail palette’s pop-up menu.
To remove thumbnails, choose Delete 
All Thumbnails from the pop-up menu. 
Note: Each thumbnail increases file size 
by roughly 3-4K.
Bookmarks
A bookmark in an Adobe PDF docu-
ment behaves like a paper bookmark 
by allowing you to navigate quickly to 
a particular page. You can use book-
marks to jump from page to page 
within a document, to another docu-
ment (PDF or non-PDF) or to a Web 
page and more. To display bookmarks, 
choose Window > Show Bookmarks.
To create a bookmark:
1. Choose Window > Show Book-
marks.
2. Navigate to the page and exact view 
(zoom) you want the bookmark to 
link to.
3. Choose New Bookmark from the 
Bookmarks palette’s pop-up menu, or 
use the quick key specified. The new 
bookmark is displayed in the palette.
4. Type in the text for the bookmark 
label and then press Enter.
When you’re done, you should test 
the bookmark by navigating to another 
place in the document and then click-
ing the bookmark. After clicking on the 
bookmark, the view should jump to the 
same exact page and zoom as when you 
set the bookmark.
Follow the same steps to create addi-
tional bookmarks. You can click and 
drag bookmark icons to arrange book-
marks in a hierarchical order, with 
nested bookmarks, as with sections of 
a chapter.
You can also associate an action with 
a bookmark. For example, clicking a 
bookmark can execute a menu com-
mand, play a movie or sound, or 
THUMBNAILS AND BOOKMARKS
Acrobat’s Navigation pane displays separate palettes for bookmarks, thumbnails, 
annotations, and signatures. In this example, thumbnails are displayed. 
The Thumbnails palette’s 
pop-up menu lets you create 
and delete icons for thumb-
nails and perform several 
other page-related tasks, like 
viewing a specific portion of a 
page by positioning the zoom 
window in the thumbnail of 
the current page.

change the view magnification. To 
associate an action with a bookmark, 
click on a specific bookmark and then 
choose Edit Properties. Use the con-
trols in the Bookmark Properties dialog 
box to specify an action.
To delete a bookmark, click on it and 
then choose Delete Bookmark from the 
Bookmarks palette’s pop-up menu.
THUMBNAILS AND BOOKMARKS
Note: When a viewer clicks on a book-
mark, the current zoom magnification 
is retained unless you specify otherwise 
when you create the bookmark. To retain 
the current zoom magnification of a 
bookmarked page, click on the book-
mark, then choose Edit > Properties. 
Click Edit Destination, then choose 
Inherit Zoom from the Magnification 
pop-up menu. Click Set Action to save 
this change.
The Bookmark Properties dialog box lets 
you apply an action to a bookmark.
Here you see bookmarks displayed in the Navigation pane. Clicking on a 
bookmark displays the associated page.
The Bookmarks palette’s pop-up menu 
lets you create and delete bookmarks and 
perform other navigation-related tasks.

Using digital signatures
Digital signatures act like conventional 
signatures — allowing you to “sign off” 
on anything that requires an approval. 
You can simply attach your “signature” 
to the document. In addition, a signa-
ture stores information, like the date 
and time, and allows you to track 
document versions and validate their 
authenticity.
To create a digital signature profile:
1. Choose Tools > Self-Sign Signatures 
> Log In.
2. In the Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures - 
Log In dialog box, click New Profile.
3. In the User Attributes area of the 
Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures - Create 
New User dialog box, enter your name 
and whatever other information you 
want to include in the three optional 
fields.
4. In the Profile File area of the Acrobat 
Self-Sign Signatures - Create New User 
dialog box, enter the path name for the 
folder in which you want to store your 
signature profile or click Browse and 
choose a folder. Enter a password of 
at least six characters in the User Pass-
word and Confirm Password fields and 
then click OK.
To add a digital signature to a 
document:
1. Click on the Digital Signature tool 
in the Tool bar and then click and 
drag where you want to place your 
signature.
2. In the Acrobat Self-Sign Signatures- 
Sign Document dialog box you can 
select an option from the Reason for 
Signing Document pop-up menu or 
enter a reason in the field, and you can 
enter a location in the Location, e.g. 
City Name field. 
Note: If you’re using a third-party signa-
ture handler, follow the instructions dis-
played on screen. You may be prompted 
to log in to the handler or enter required 
information.
DIGITAL SIGNATURES
3. Enter your password in the Confirm 
User Password field and then click Save 
Document.
4. If this is the first signature added to 
the document, the Save As dialog box 
is displayed. Enter a name and choose a 
location for the file and then click OK.
Note: If the Save As dialog box is dis-
played when you add a digital signature,

Adobe PostScript 3
Adobe PostScript, developed in 1985, is 
a page-description language for print-
ing and displaying documents that 
integrate text, graphics, images, and 
color.
PostScript has evolved through suc-
cessive LanguageLevels 1, 2, and 
PostScript 3. LanguageLevel 1 includes 
the initial features and commands or 
“operators” of the PostScript language. 
LanguageLevel 2 expands the 
functionality of LanguageLevel 1 to 
include device-independent color and 
improved memory management. 
PostScript 3 includes all the features 
of LanguageLevels 1 and 2, and pro-
vides further enhancements, which this 
document identifies. 
Enhanced Image Technology
The following PostScript 3 features 
enhance image editing and output.
• Smooth Shading feature renders
gradient fills at the resolution of the 
printing system, reducing print time 
and improving output quality. Smooth 
shading significantly reduces banding 
from desktop printers and eliminates 
it entirely on high-resolution devices 
such as imagesetters and direct-to-plate 
systems. 
• Masked Images feature replaces com-
plex clipping paths with a raster mask. 
LanguageLevel 2 commonly defined 
masked images by drawing a clipping 
path between the pixels of the source 
image. This method often resulted in 
limit check errors when saving or 
printing complex or multiple clipping 
paths. The masked images feature in 
PostScript 3 lets you place images 
on the page without concern for the 
constraints of the clipping path. 
Instead of mathematically tracing each 
line segment, the masked images fea-
ture indicates which individual pixels 
in the image should be masked.
• Selectable Separations feature lets you 
print color separations, even on low-
end monochrome printing systems. A 
“separation” is the output that corre-
sponds to one color plate (e.g., cyan, 
magenta, yellow, or black). In the past, 
only imagesetters could generate sep-
arations as individually imaged pages. 
Other printing devices depended on 
the host computer to produce the 
imaged data for each separation. With 
selectable separations, you can perform 
basic proofing of separations without 
having to output to film, saving time 
and money.
• More Gray Levels feature lets you 
print photo-quality grayscale (256  
gray levels) images on monochrome 
desktop printing systems. Although 
PostScript interpreters can handle  
256 gray levels, most desktop mono-
chrome printers can print only 32 
to 72 gray levels. PostScript 3 uses 
“supercells” that increase the number 
of printable gray levels by a factor 
of four. This technology also helps 
high-resolution devices such as 
imagesetters print 4,096 shades of gray 
in each separation to produce images 
with smoother blends.
• In-RIP Trapping lets you use a raster  
image processor (RIP) to perform 
trapping rather than a page layout 
or post-processing application (e.g., 
DK&A Trapper). You can specify  
regions on a page, called trapping  
zones, and specify a set of trapping  
parameters, then use the RIP to 
calculate and administer traps for each  
region. For print service providers,  
in-RIP trapping saves time and  
money by eliminating the need for  
manual, labor-intensive trapping  
processes in proprietary and expensive 
systems. In-RIP trapping is an  
optional PostScript feature, so not 
all PostScript 3 devices support it. 
• HiFi Color lets you specify and render 
more vibrant hues and richer colors 
than in previous LanguageLevels. The 
HiFi color specification lets applica-
tions such as Adobe InDesign trans-
form data into HiFi color spaces (e.g., 
Pantone Hexachrome) prior to print-
ing. HiFi color rendering performs 
color transformations in the PostScript 
interpreter, reducing print times.
• Improved Color Control provides 
greater control for overprinting color 
components. This feature introduces 
the DeviceN color space, which  
allows the composite specification of 
an arbitrary number of device- 
dependent color components (e.g., 
cyan, magenta, and yellow). Previously, 
to alter only the cyan, magenta, and 
yellow device color components and 
leave the black component unaltered, 
you needed to use the Separations 
color space, called Device CMYK, 
once each for cyan, magenta, and yellow 
component.
Advanced Page Processing 
The following LanguageLevel 3 
features enhance print performance:
• Idiom Recognition converts less 
efficient LanguageLevel 2 operators 
(e.g., application-generated contours 
and iterative shades) into higher-
quality, faster-printing PostScript 3 
operators.
• Fast Image Printing lets you print 
raster images in fast draft or near-final 
quality modes. This feature optimizes 
ADOBE POSTSCRIPT 3

71
images and speeds printing by inserting 
device-specific halftone values.
Improved Font Technology and 
Extended Font Set 
The following PostScript 3 features 
improves font management and 
increase available fonts:
• Compact Font Format (CFF) is a 
compact representation of one or more 
Type 1 (PostScript) fonts. Unlike pre-
vious PostScript font formats, CFF 
allows multiple fonts to be stored 
together in a unit called a font set. 
CFF significantly reduces required disk 
space of fonts by using a compact 
binary representation of fonts and by 
sharing data that is common to mul-
tiple fonts.
• Chameleon Font Format uses a 
“shape library” which allows compact 
representations of Roman font shapes 
for book and display faces. Chameleon 
fonts can be tailored to address the font 
needs of a device. 
• Extended Font Set increases the 
number of standard fonts. While there 
is no standard set of required fonts, 
Adobe PostScript 3 devices typically 
use an extended set of 136 fonts that 
are built into the PostScript inter-
preter. LanguageLevel 3 has defined a 
new character in the Symbol font set 
and has added Central and Eastern 
European (CE) character encodings to 
PostScript character sets. 
Adobe PostScript 3
The evolution of corporate networks 
and the World Wide Web have pro-
foundly affected the content and qual-
ity of communications. The complexity 
and visual content of documents is no 
longer limited by the artistic skills of 
the designer. Corporate intranets and 
Web sites are being tapped into for cre-
ative content that is much more com-
plex than could have been imagined. 
As creative expression expands to new 
levels, the quality of the printed output 
must also rise to the challenge.
The Internet has changed not only the 
dynamics of the creative process but 
the entire printing workflow process. 
The Internet is used to transmit infor-
mation electronically while CD-ROMs 
and servers are used for storing and 
accessing data. It’s often difficult to 
predict what will be printed because 
documents can come from many 
sources. And it’s equally difficult to 
predict where they will be printed, 
because documents can be distributed 
around the world electronically and 
printed locally. The printing workflow 
has evolved from creating, printing, 
copying, and distributing hard-copy 
documents to creating, electronically 
publishing, and printing documents on 
demand. It was clearly time to advance 
the imaging standard.
Adobe PostScript 3: the next gener-
ation of Adobe PostScript printing
With the introduction of PostScript 
in 1985, Adobe Systems Incorporated 
sparked a revolution in how we com-
municate on the printed page. Since 
its introduction, Adobe PostScript has 
become the printing and imaging tech-
nology of choice for corporations, 
publishers, and government agencies 
throughout the world. In fact, 75 per-
cent of commercial publications are 
printed on Adobe PostScript-licensed 
devices, including black-and-white 
printers, color printers, imagesetters, 
platesetters, and direct digital printing 
systems. Adobe PostScript is also found 
as the display imaging system in some 
of the most advanced workstations on 
the market today.
ADOBE POSTSCRIPT 3
Adobe has continually launched evolu-
tionary and revolutionary solutions for 
every printing market. With the intro-
duction of Adobe PostScript 3, Adobe 
once again takes the worldwide imaging 
standard to the next level with a new 
and innovative approach to printing.
Adobe PostScript 3 takes the PostScript 
standard beyond a page description 
language into a fully optimized print-
ing system that addresses the broad 
range of new requirements in today’s 
increasingly complex and distributed 
printing environments.
By fully integrating Portable Docu-
ment Format (PDF) — an open file 
format that preserves the visual fidelity 
of documents across applications and 
platforms — into Adobe PostScript 3, 
documents can be delivered electroni-
cally and printed directly. A PDF file 
delivers the single “digital master” for 
use in electronic, printed, and cross 
media workflows, ensuring the highest 
fidelity across all media.
Adobe PostScript 3 delivers targeted 
benefits to its users for whom printing 
the right document in the right way 
is critical. In the enterprise, office 
and graphics users will see improved 
performance and better network inte-
gration. In professional applications, 
graphics arts users will see new creative 
features. And production users — 
from graphics arts through high-vol-
ume printing — get increasing reli-
ability and predictability from their 
printing systems.


Appendix A
Other Workflow Considerations
This section takes you beyond the basic 
steps of creating PDF files for press 
and print workflows. It explores more 
complex print-related workflow con-
siderations — such as trapping, OPI, 
and working with bleeds — that may 
play an important role in your PDF 
workflow.
Working with Encapsulated 
PostScript (EPS) files

or colorized TIFF files

or blends

74
Working with Encapsulated 
PostScript (EPS) files 
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) is a 
graphic file format. An EPS file is 
not designed for printing. It is usually 
incorporated in a page design and then 
printed. Acrobat Distiller can convert 
EPS files to PDF files, but, unlike 
PostScript files, EPS files do not have 
a defined page size and may not 
include required fonts. The default 
page size and resolution in Distiller’s 
job options compensate for the lack of 
a defined page size in EPS files.
Distiller gains access to font informa-
tion in two ways: 
• The font is included in the PostScript 
file that Distiller is converting.
• The font is available in a monitored 
font location.
If you get font errors when trying to 
convert an EPS file created in any 
application other than QuarkXPress 
(version 4.0 or later) to a PDF file, 
you probably did not embed the fonts 
in the EPS file when it was saved. 
To eliminate font errors in PDF files, 
embed fonts in EPS files when saving 
the EPS file from the original appli-
cation. In Adobe Illustrator software, 
check “Include Document Fonts” 
when creating an EPS file.
If a particular font is unavailable, 
Distiller will substitute the Courier 
font.
Note: Distiller will substitute the Cou-
rier font only if you previously disabled 
the superatm and distsadb.dos files. Dis-
tiller will also substitute with Adobe 
San/Serif MM fonts.
Depending on the operating system, 
Distiller will monitor font folders and 
use the fonts in those folders to 
convert PostScript files with unembed-
ded fonts. If you need Distiller to mon-
itor font folders other than the default 
folders, you can add those font loca-
tions in Distiller.
Working with Desktop Color 
Separation (DCS) files
DCS files are Encapsulated PostScript 
(EPS) files that use a low-resolution 
display image with high-resolution 
data for color separations. DCS 1.0 files 
are composed of five parts: a low-reso-
lution file for placement, and separa-
tions files for cyan, magenta, yellow, 
and black. DCS 2.0 files support spot 
color separations and can store all the 
separations in one file.
While Adobe Acrobat Distiller 4.0 
software or later versions support both 
PostScript (*.ps) and EPS files, they do 
not support Desktop Color Separation 
(DCS) files. If you distill a DCS file, 
Distiller may return the error, “Warn-
ing: Empty Job. No PDF file produced.” 
PDF files created from DCS files will 
not appear or print as expected (for 
example, only one channel will appear).
You can only create PDF files from 
DCS files by saving them in EPS format 
and then distilling the EPS files. The 
EPS file format does not support alpha 
channels, so you must remove alpha 
channels from the DCS files before 
saving them as EPS files. 
When working with DCS files, we 
recommend you follow these steps:
1. Create a pre-separated “fat” 
PostScript file that contains all the 
image data, separated into the four 
process-color channels prior to 
distilling.
2. To retain a composite PostScript 
workflow with your DCS images, 
open the DCS file in an image-editing 
program such as Adobe Photoshop, 
and then save it as a CMYK, TIFF, or 
EPS file. 
3. Link the new image to your 
document. 
Note: To maintain a composite 
PostScript workflow in QuarkXPress 4.0 
or later, use the SmartXT XTension from 
Total Integration to recombine the DCS 
file into a single file when creating a com-
posite PostScript file. There is no similar 
plug-in for PageMaker at this time.
Check with your service provider to 
see if their OPI server software can 
handle the picture replacement of a 
five-file DCS 1.0 image in a composite 
PostScript workflow. 
OTHER WORKFLOW CONSIDERATIONS

75
Working with multi-toned EPS files 
or colorized TIFF files
Multi-toned images created in 
Photoshop® 5.02 or later and placed 
into QuarkXPress 4.04 and later or 
InDesign will be retained in a com-
posite PDF file if the PostScript gen-
erated by QuarkXPress or InDesign 
is LanguageLevel 2 or Level 3. These 
PostScript files will maintain color 
information when converted to PDF if 
Acrobat 4.0 compatibility is selected in 
Acrobat Distiller. Colorized TIFF files 
will not color-separate properly when 
included in a document printed to disk 
as a composite PostScript file. These 
images contain additional spot color 
components that are not supported in 
composite mode.
Multi-toned images — such as 
duotones, tritones, and quadtones —
represent the use of a single gray image 
to paint multiple color components. 
For example, in a duotone, a single 
gray image might be used to paint the 
black component as well as a spot-color 
component (the tone reproduction is 
different for the two color compo-
nents). Because these additional spot 
color components are not supported in 
composite PostScript LanguageLevel 1 
or LanguageLevel 2 files, they will not 
color-separate properly.
Working with vector graphics 
containing custom color gradients 
or blends
With Adobe Illustrator 8.01 or later, 
vector EPS files that contain gradients 
or blends of two custom or spot colors 
will be maintained when you create a 
composite PostScript file and separate 
it at the RIP or convert it to a PDF file. 
Bleeds
To preserve bleed information, create 
a PostScript file with a page size larger 
than your original document. Using 
the Acrobat Distiller PPD, you can 
create custom page sizes from the Page 
Setup or Print dialog box. To create a 
larger page size, add approximately one 
inch to your document size. For exam-
ple, if your page width is 8.5 inches, 
type in 9.5 inches. Select registration 
and crop marks and set the page orien-
tation to Portrait. Your resulting PDF 
file will be 9.5 by 12 inches.
Trapping
In order for Acrobat Distiller to pre-
serve trapping information in a PDF 
file, you must include the information 
in the composite PostScript file.
The page layout application you are 
using determines what document trap-
ping information you can include in 
the composite PostScript file. QuarkX-
Press 3.3.2 software or later versions 
include document trapping infor-
mation only when creating pre-sepa-
rated PostScript files. On the other 
hand, Adobe PageMaker 6.01 or later 
versions include document trapping 
information in both composite and 
pre-separated PostScript files. If you 
are using QuarkXPress, you may need 
to modify your workflow (for example, 
use a post-processing application to 
trap the file or use an output device 
that supports in-RIP trapping).
Note: Some raster-based prepress 
workflows ignore application trapping 
information, so check with your service 
provider about trapping.
OTHER WORKFLOW CONSIDERATIONS
OPI
With Acrobat Distiller 4.0 software or 
later versions, you can specify that Dis-
tiller read and preserve Open Prepress 
Interface (OPI) 1.3 and 2.0 comments.
Naming PostScript files
Some Windows applications use .prn 
extensions rather than the designated 
.ps extension. If this occurs, you should 
rename the file with a .ps extension to 
enable the Acrobat Distiller program 
to recognize and process the file. Win-
dows may add a .prn suffix to the file.

The Ultimate On-Q Server
The Ultimate On-Q Server is the automated 
PostScript and PDF workflow solution for pre-
press and printing professionals. On-Q is an ICC 
color-managed workflow that includes trapping, 
OPI, and imposition. The Ultimate On-Q Server is 
the non-proprietary prepress solution for profes-

into their shop. While some workflow solutions 
necessitate costly purchases to replace most of 
the hardware in a shop, the On-Q Server easily 
integrates with your existing server and output 
device setup.
Impostrip
Impostrip replaces the manual and time-consum-
ing task of “stripping.” Before Impostrip, docu-
ments were output one or two pages at a time to 
an imagesetter, and then manually stripped onto 
a plate for printing. Times have changed since 
Ultimate invented digital imposition more than 
ten years ago. Some companies have since tried 
to imitate Impostrip, but none have achieved the 
level of quality and accuracy the publishing and 
printing industry demands — and gets — with 
Impostrip. Impostrip imposes PostScript and PDF 
documents from more than 150 applications for 
output to imagesetters and platesetters. Impostrip 
also imposes jobs for sheetfed and multiple-web 
presses and provides sophisticated yet easy-to-use 
tools to accomplish jobs faster than any applica-
tion on the market.

Adobe PostScript 
A page description language developed 
by Adobe Systems Incorporated.
ATM® 
Adobe Type Manager® software cre-
ated by Adobe Systems. ATM provides 
crisp, clear type at any point size 
onscreen and in print.
Black Generation 
The representation of black using only 
the K component, instead of a combi-
nation of C, M, and Y.
Bleeds 
Extending the image beyond the 
finished trim size so that the image 
runs right to the edge of the printed 
sheet after trimming and binding. 
Bitmap 
Graphic images consisting of many 
tiny cells of numerical computer data. 
The number of cells determines the 
resolution of the bitmap, while the 
value of each cell establishes the density 
or darkness of each cell and therefore 
its tone.
CMYK 
An acronym for the four process 
colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and 
black.
DCS 
An acronym for Desktop Color 
Separation, a data file standard defined 
by QuarkXPress to assist in making 
color separations with a desktop pub-
lishing system. Using DCS, five files 
are created: four color files containing 
cyan, magenta, yellow, and black image 
data, and a composite color view file of 
the color image.
Driver 
Software that aids in the transfer of infor-
mation between the computer and the 
peripheral controlled by the driver soft-
ware program. In publishing, the most 
common drivers are printer drivers.
Duotone 
A halftone image created by overprint-
ing two different halftone screens of the 
same image with different tonal values. 
Duotones are printed using two black 
inks or a black and a colored ink. Duo-
tones are created to increase the detail 
and saturation of the black part of an 
image, or to create a special effect.
EPS 
An acronym for Encapsulated 
PostScript, a file type that is created by 
a wide variety of computer programs. 
EPS files contain all of the vector and 
bitmap information necessary to image 
a single page. These files are usually not 
intended to be printed by themselves, 
but are placed in a page design and 
then printed.
Grayscale 
Data represented by only the K 
component.
In-RIP trapping 
The process of trapping data inside the 
RIP during the print process.
JPEG 
An acronym for Joint Photographic 
Experts Group, an ISO group that has 
established a standard for the compres-
sion of bitmapped, scanned, and ren-
dered color images.
Monochrome 
A single color. Monochrome usually 
refers to a black-and-white image.
OPI 
An acronym for Open Prepress Inter-
face, a communication connection 
developed by Aldus Corporation that 
facilitates links between CEPS and 
desktop publishing systems. Using 
OPI, view files or high resolution scans 
can be transferred to desktop publish-
ing systems and placed in page layout 
software. When the page file is sent 
back to the CEPS for processing and 
output, the high resolution image data 
is automatically swapped for the view 
file. OPI is frequently used by systems 
that seek to maintain high-resolution 
image data separate from page layout 
files. OPI is often compared to DCS.
PDF 
An acronym for Portable Document 
Format. Created by Adobe Systems, 
PDF is a file format used to represent a 
document in a manner independent of 
the application software, hardware, and 
operating system used to create it.
PPD 
An acronym for PostScript Printer 
Description file. Each PostScript 
printer has an associated PPD file, 
which contains information used by 
printer drivers and some applications 
to control the PostScript creation 
criteria.
PressOptimized 
A built-in set of Acrobat Distiller Job  
Options recommended by Adobe to 
create a PDF file optimized for output 
to a press. 
PrintOptimized 
A built-in set of Acrobat Distiller Job 
Options recommended by Adobe to 
create a PDF file optimized for output 
to a four-color composite printer.
GLOSSARY

83
Quark PDF 
A printer description file used by 
QuarkXPress 3.3.1 and earlier versions 
of the software to read PPD files. 
Quark PDF files are not used in 
QuarkXPress 3.3.2 or later.
RGB 
An acronym for red, green, and blue, 
the three primary colors blended to 
create the spectrum of colors displayed 
on a color monitor.
ScreenOptimized 
A built-in set of Acrobat Distiller Job 
Options recommended by Adobe to 
create a PDF file optimized for display 
on a monitor.
TIFF 
An acronym for Tagged Image File 
Format, a standard format developed 
by Aldus Corporation for bitmap or 
raster graphics — usually scanned 
images. TIFF can handle a variety of 
image data, from 8-bit black-and-white 
images to 24-bit color RGB or CMYK 
images.
Trapping 
The intentional overlapping of colors 
along common boundaries to prevent 
unprinted paper from showing in the 
event of misregistration in printing.
UCR 
An acronym for undercolor removal. 
UCR is the technique for reducing 
the cyan, magenta, and yellow content 
in neutral gray shadow areas of a 
reproduction and replacing them with 
black ink so that the reproduction will 
appear normal but will use less process 
color ink.
ZIP
A compression method that does not 
remove data to achieve compression.
