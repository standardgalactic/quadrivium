Photoshop Elements 7 For Dummies 

Introduction
W
hat was once a consumer-grade, low-level program for beginning 
image editors and a junior cousin to the powerful Adobe Photoshop 
program has evolved and matured to stand on its own merits now in version 
7.0 for Windows and (as is often the case with the release of this program) 
later on the Macintosh. As of this writing, Elements is available on the Mac 
only in version 6. However, Adobe’s history with Photoshop Elements is that 
the Mac version typically follows several months after the Windows release.
You won’t find much comparison between Adobe Photoshop Elements and 
Adobe Photoshop in this book, nor will you see any suggestions that you 
should consider using Photoshop for one thing or another. We don’t make 
suggestions simply because Photoshop Elements is a powerful tool that satis-
fies many needs of amateurs and professionals alike.
Why should you buy Elements (and, ultimately, this book)? The range of 
people who can benefit from using Elements is wide and includes a vast audi-
ence. From beginning image editors to intermediate users to more advanced 
amateurs and professionals, Elements has something for everyone. We’ll even 
stick our necks out a little and suggest that many Photoshop users can ben-
efit greatly by adding Elements to their software tool cabinets. Why? Because 
Elements offers some wonderful creation and sharing tools that Photoshop 
hasn’t yet dreamed of supporting. For example, in Photoshop Elements 7, you 
can create postcards, greeting cards, and photo albums with just a few mouse 
clicks. You can place orders with online service centers that professionally 
print your photo creations. All these opportunities are available in Elements, 
and we cover these and many more creation ideas in Chapters 15 and 16.
To set your frame of mind to thinking in Photoshop Elements terms, don’t 
think of the program as a scaled-down version of Adobe Photoshop; those 
days are gone. If you’re a digital photographer and you shoot your pictures in 
JPEG or Camera Raw format, Elements has the tools for you to open, edit, and 
massage your pictures into professional images. If you worry about color pro-
file embedding, forget it. Elements can handle the task for you, as we explain 
in Chapter 4, where we talk about Camera Raw, and in Chapter 14, where 
we talk about color profiling and printing. For the professional, Photoshop 
Elements has just about everything you need to create final images for color 
printing and commercial printing.
If you’re a beginner or an intermediate user, you’ll find some of the Photoshop 
Elements quick-fix operations a breeze to use to help you enhance your images, 
as we explain in Chapters 9 and 10. And, when it comes time for you to print 
some homemade greeting cards and photo albums — whether you’re a 
beginner, an intermediate user, or a professional user — Elements provides

Photoshop Elements 7 For Dummies 
you with easy-to-follow steps to package your creations, as we cover in 
Chapters 15 and 16. In addition, the wonderful new sharing services available 
free to you on Photoshop.com are your gateway to keeping family, friends, 
and clients connected to your photos, as we explain in Chapter 16.
About This Book
This book is an effort to provide, in about 400 pages, as much of a compre-
hensive view of a wildly feature-rich program as we can. There’s a lot to 
Elements, and we try to offer you as much as possible within our limited 
amount of space. We begged for more pages, but alas, our publisher wants 
to get this book in your hands in full color and with an attractive price tag. 
Therefore, even though we may skip over a few little things, all you need to 
know about using Photoshop Elements for designing images for print, shar-
ing, Web hosting, versatile packaging, e-mailing, and more is covered in the 
pages ahead.
As we said, Photoshop Elements has something for just about everyone. Hence, 
we know that our audience is large and that not everyone will use every tool, 
command, or method described in this book. Therefore, we added a lot of cross-
references in the text, in case you want to jump around. You can go to just about 
any chapter and start reading; and, if some concept needs more explanation, we 
point you in the right direction for getting some background when it’s necessary.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout this book, we point you to menus where commands are accessed 
frequently. A couple of things to remember are the references for where to 
go when we detail steps in a procedure. For accessing a menu command, you 
may see a sentence like this one:
Choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
When you see commands like this one mentioned, we’re asking you to click 
the File menu to open the drop-down menu, click the menu command labeled 
Get Photos, and then choose the command From Files and Folders from the 
submenu that appears.
Another convention we use refers to context menus. A context menu jumps 
up at your cursor position and shows you a menu similar to the menu you 
select at the top of the Elements workspace. To open a context menu, right-
click the mouse (Shift-click on the Mac).

 Introduction
A third item relates to using keystrokes on your keyboard. When we mention 
that some keys need to be pressed on your keyboard, the text is described 
like this:
Press Alt+Shift+Ctrl+S
In this case, you hold down the Alt key, the Shift key, and the Control key and 
then press the S key. Then, release all the keys at the same time.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into logical parts where related features are nested 
together in chapters within six different parts of the book.
Part I: Getting Started
If you just bought a digital camera and you’re new to image editing in a pro-
gram like Photoshop Elements, you’re probably tempted to jump into fixing 
and editing your pictures. The essentials usually aren’t the most exciting part 
of any program or book. That’s true with this book, too: The more mundane 
issues related to understanding some basics are assembled in the first three 
chapters. Although some bits of information aren’t as exciting as in many 
other chapters, you must understand them before you start editing images. 
Be sure to review the first three chapters before you dive into the other 
chapters.
In Part I, we talk about the tools, menus, commands, preferences, work-
spaces, and features that help you move around easily in the program. The 
more you pick up in the preliminary chapters, the more easily you can adapt 
to the Elements way of working.
Part II: Getting Organized
In Part II, we talk about getting photos in Elements, organizing your files, 
searching for files, and grouping your photos, and we give you much more 
information related to the Photoshop Elements Organizer. The Organizer is 
your central workplace, and knowing a great deal about using the Organizer 
window helps you move around much faster in the program.
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos
Part III relates to creating and manipulating selections. There’s a lot to making 
selections in photos, but after you figure it out (by reading Chapter 7), you 

4
Photoshop Elements 7 For Dummies 
can cut out a figure in a picture and drop it into another picture, drop different 
backgrounds into pictures, or isolate an area that needs some brightness and 
contrast adjustment. In Chapter 8, we talk about layers and how to create and 
manage them in Elements. In many other chapters, we refer you to Chapter 8 
because you need to work with layers for many other tasks you do in Elements.
In Chapter 9, we talk about fixing image flaws and problems. That picture you 
took with your digital camera may be underexposed or overexposed, or it 
may need some work to remove dust and scratches. Maybe it needs a little 
sharpening, or some other imperfection requires editing. All the know-hows 
and how-tos are in this chapter.
In Chapter 10, we cover how to correct color problems, brightness, and con-
trast. We show you ways to quickly fix photos, as well as some methods for 
custom image corrections.
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist
This part is designed to bring out the artist in you. Considering the easy 
application of Elements filter effects, you can turn a photo image into a drawing 
or apply a huge number of different effects to change the look of your image.
In Chapter 12, we talk about drawing and painting so that you can let your 
artistic expression run wild. We follow up in Chapter 13 by talking about 
adding text to photos so that you can create your own layouts, posters, 
cards, and more.
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing
One critical chapter in this book is Chapter 14, in which we talk about print-
ing your pictures. If your prints don’t look the way they do on your monitor, 
you need to read and reread this chapter.
If screen viewing is of interest to you, we cover a number of different options 
for viewing your pictures onscreen in Chapter 15. For slide shows, Web-
hosted images, animated images, photo viewing on your TV, and even creat-
ing movie files, this chapter shows you the many ways you can view your 
Elements images onscreen.
We wrap up this part with Chapter 16, in which we describe how to make cre-
ations and share files by using the new Photoshop.com service provided by 
Adobe Systems. You have a number of different options for making creations 
to share or print.

 Introduction
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The last part of the book contains the Part of Tens chapters. We offer ten tips 
for composing better images and give you ten more project ideas to try with 
Elements.
Icons Used in This Book
In the margins throughout this book, you see icons indicating that something 
important is stated in the respective text.
 
This icon informs you that the item discussed is a new feature in Photoshop 
Elements 7.
 
A Tip tells you about an alternative method for a procedure, by giving you a 
shortcut, a workaround, or some other type of helpful information related to 
working on tasks in the section being discussed.
 
Pay particular attention when you see the Warning icon. This icon indicates 
possible side-effects you might encounter when performing certain opera-
tions in Elements.
 
This icon is a heads-up for something you may want to commit to memory. 
Usually, it tells you about a shortcut for a repetitive task, where remembering 
a procedure can save you time.
 
Elements is a computer program, after all. No matter how hard we try to sim-
plify our explanation of features, we can’t entirely avoid the technical informa-
tion. If we think that a topic is complex, we use this icon to alert you that we’re 
moving into a complex subject. You won’t see many of these icons in the book 
because we try our best to give you the details in nontechnical terms.
Where to Go from Here
As we say earlier in the Introduction, the first part of this book serves as 
a foundation for all the other chapters. Try to spend a little time reading 
through the three chapters in Part I. After that, feel free to jump around and 
pay special attention to the cross-referenced chapters, in case you get stuck 
on a concept.

Part I
Getting Started

In this part . . .
H
ere you have it: a computer book speciﬁ -
cally designed to help you get the most out 
of a computer software program — and not just 
any software program, but a powerful one with 
many complicated features. You probably want to 
jump in and perform some spiffy editing opera-
tions to get that prize photo looking the best you 
can. Inasmuch as we try to accommodate you in 
setting forth a how-to book in a nonlinear fashion, 
where you can freely move around and read about 
the techniques you want to use without having to 
read each chapter in order, you have to under-
stand a few basics for editing your photos.
In this ﬁ rst part of the book, we talk about some 
essentials to help you fully understand all the 
parts ahead. We ﬁ rst talk about your Photoshop 
Elements working environment and describe the 
many tools and features you can use for all your 
Elements sessions. We also cover the very impor-
tant task of getting color set for optimum viewing 
on your computer monitor and describe some 
essentials you need to know about color as it 
relates to photo images. Part I contains some 
important information that you should plan to 
carefully review and understand before going 
too far into all the Elements features. Don’t pass 
up this part. Turn the page and start getting 
acquainted with the Adobe Photoshop Elements 
basics.

Getting to Know the Work Area
In This Chapter
▶ Opening Photoshop Elements
▶ Understanding the Elements workspace
▶ Changing workspace views
▶ Working with the Project Bin
▶ Using the Undo History panel
▶ Accessing Help documents
▶ Using keyboard shortcuts
W
hen you first launch Photoshop Elements, you arrive at a Welcome 
screen. The Welcome screen offers you several choices for open-
ing up some different editing modes, special Elements tasks that 
you can perform, and an opportunity to sign up for an Adobe 
Web-hosted service.
When it comes to editing a photograph, you find quite 
a collection of tools, panels, buttons, and options 
in the Photoshop Elements Edit mode. Just a quick 
glance at the Elements workspace when you enter 
Full Edit mode shows you some of the power that 
Elements offers with just a click of your mouse. With 
all the possibilities, navigating the Elements work-
spaces and engaging in an editing session can be 
intimidating. To ease your introduction to the many 
options for editing your pictures, we break them down 
for you in this chapter.
Elements has several work areas, and we start off by intro-
ducing you to the Welcome screen. Then, we move on to the 
mode you’ll likely use frequently — Full Edit mode. In this mode, you can 
be creative with all the tools and features Photoshop Elements is known for, 
such as filters, drawing tools, layers, and more. We then introduce other 
work areas and tools you may not be as familiar with — Quick Edit mode for 
making common corrections to photos; Creation mode for collecting your 

10
Par t I: Get ting Started 
photos into creations, such as calendars; and the Project Bin for navigating 
among all your open images.
Before you start working in Elements, you may find it helpful to know how 
to undo edits so that you can start over easily and find additional sources 
of help within Elements. We also explain one of the handiest ways to select 
tools and enter common commands: keyboard shortcuts.
Elements 7 also has the Organizer, a powerful tool for acquiring your images 
and keeping them organized. The Organizer includes features that help you 
view and search for images, too. We introduce the Organizer in Part II.
Launching Photoshop Elements 7
A great place to start in Elements is a central navigation area where you can 
choose what mode and activity you want to engage in. Well, that’s exactly 
what Adobe provides you when you open Photoshop Elements. It’s like the 
command center on the Starship Enterprise, except you won’t find Spock 
asking the computer any questions. The Welcome screen is easy to navigate 
and intuitive, as you can see in Figure 1-1.
Here’s what you find in 
the Welcome screen:
 
✓ Photoshop.com 
Membership: For 
many generations of 
Photoshop Elements, 
Adobe has depended 
on third-party ser-
vices for sharing 
files and placing 
orders for prints. 
You haven’t lost any 
of these services, but 
Adobe has brought 
the sharing business 
under the fold of its own online servers. You get a whopping 2 gigabytes 
of hard-disk space to upload files and share them with friends. The best 
thing about the Photoshop.com service is that it’s free! Because this fea-
ture is closely related to sharing files, we include all the descriptions for 
using the service in Chapter 16. If you just can’t wait to get through all 
the things we talk about related to other features in Elements, jump to 
Chapter 16 and have a look at this new Photoshop Elements service.
 
✓ Organize: Click the Organize button to open the Organizer, where you 
can manage your collections of pictures stored on your hard drive. We 
cover using the Organizer and so many of its great features in Part II.
Figure 1-1: The Photoshop Elements Welcome screen 
appears when you launch Elements.

11
 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
 
✓ Edit: If you need to edit a photo, click the Edit button to access options 
for using either the Quick Fix mode to do some quick editing tasks or 
Full Edit mode, in which you can do the extraordinary editing jobs.
 
✓ Create: Click the Create button to move into the Create mode. In this 
mode, you can do some fancy things that Elements provides you, such 
as creating greeting cards, photo books, and calendars.
 
✓ Share: The Share workspace is all about sharing your photos. It’s all well 
and good to admire your own creations, but getting kudos from others 
can make you feel great. The Share workspace provides you options for 
creating an online album, e-mailing photos, printing your pictures, plac-
ing print orders, and copying photos to CD-ROMs and DVDs. We cover 
all you want to know about sharing your pictures in Chapter 16.
If you know what you want to do in Elements, go ahead and click the appropri-
ate button. But if you enter one mode and then decide you want to do some-
thing in another mode, Elements provides you the freedom to easily change 
modes from within the different workspaces.
Just one more thing before we leave 
the Welcome screen. You can always 
return to the Welcome screen after 
you enter any editing mode. At the 
top of the Elements window in all 
modes, a house icon appears, as 
shown in Figure 1-2. Click this icon to 
open the Welcome screen again.
Getting Around in Full Edit Mode
Full Edit mode offers bundles of tools that you can use to edit your images, 
from correction tools for fixing color and clarity to filters, layers, and more 
for changing existing photos or creating entirely original images from 
scratch. But all these tools also make Full Edit mode complex.
Figure 1-3 shows Elements in Full Edit mode, highlighting all the tools and fea-
tures we discuss in the following sections.
Jumping to Full Edit mode
You can move into Full Edit mode in a couple of ways:
 
✓ From the initial Welcome screen: Click Edit and open a photo. Your 
Elements window appears in Full Edit mode, as shown in Figure 1-3.
 
✓ From the Organizer: Click a photo and click Fix. Click Full Edit to open 
the selected file in Full Edit mode.

in any editing mode to reopen the Welcome 
screen.

menu to open the selected file in Full Edit mode.
Examining the image window
Not surprisingly, the image window’s tools and features are most useful when 
an image is open in the window. To get an image into the image window (as 
shown in Figure 1-3), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open.
 
 The standard Open dialog box appears. It works like any ordinary Open 
dialog box you find in other applications.

13
 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
 
2. Move around your hard drive by using methods you know to open 
folders, and then select a picture.
 
 If you haven’t yet downloaded digital camera images or acquired 
scanned photos and want an image to experiment with, you can use an 
image found in your My Pictures folder that was installed with Windows.
 
 Elements installs some nice sample images with the application instal-
lation. Look in the Photoshop Elements 7\Tutorial folder to find some 
photos to play with. 
 
3. After selecting a picture, click Open.
 
 The photo opens in a new image window in Elements.
 
You can open as many image windows in Elements as your computer memory 
can handle. When each new file is opened, a thumbnail image is added to the 
Project Bin at the bottom of the screen (see Figure 1-3), and the image windows 
are stacked, with the current active image in the topmost window. To bring 
another open file to the foreground and make it active, click the respective 
thumbnail in the Project Bin.
Here’s a quick look at important items in the image window, as shown in 
Figure 1-4:
 
✓ Scroll bars: Become active when you zoom in on an image. You can click 
the scroll arrows, move the scroll bar, or grab the Hand tool in the Tools 
panel and then drag within the 
window to move the image.
 
✓ Magnification box: Shows you 
at a glance how much you have 
zoomed in or out.
 
✓ Information box: Shows you a 
readout for a particular tidbit 
of information. You can choose 
what information you want to 
see in this area by selecting one 
of the options from the pop-up 
menu, which we discuss in more 
detail later in this section.
 
 When you’re working on an 
image in Elements, you always 
want to know the physical image 
size, the image resolution, and 
the color mode. (These terms 
are explained in more detail in 
Chapters 3 and 4.) Regardless of 
which menu option you select

from the status bar, you can get a quick glimpse at these essential stats 
by clicking the Information box, which 
displays a pop-up menu like the one shown 
in Figure 1-5.
 
✓ Size box: Enables you to resize the window. 
Move the cursor to the box, and a diagonal 
line with two opposing arrows appears. When 
the cursor changes, drag in or out to size the 
window smaller or larger, respectively.
 
 You can also resize the window by dragging 
any of the corners in or out.
 
✓ Minimize button: The – button in the upper-
right corner of the image window. Click this button to hide the window 
from view. The window’s still open; you just click the image in the 
Project Bin to return the image to the previous size in the window.
 
✓ Maximize button: The button with the box-shaped icon. If you click this 
button, the Title bar shown at the top of the window disappears and 
provides you with a little more room for viewing images in the window.
 
✓ Close button: Shaped like an X. Click this button to close the active image 
window and keep Elements open. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard 
shortcut Ctrl/Ô+W or choose File➪Close to close the active window.
After you’re familiar with the overall image window, we want to introduce 
you to the Information box’s pop-up menu, which enables you to choose the 
type of information you want to view in the Information box. Click the right-
pointing arrow to open the menu, as shown in Figure 1-6.
Here’s the lowdown of the options 
you find on the pop-up menu:
 
✓ Document Sizes: Shows you the 
saved file size.
 
✓ Document Profile: Shows 
you the color profile used with 
the file.
 
✓ Document Dimensions: As 
shown in Figure 1-6, shows you 
the physical size in your default 
unit of measure, such as inches.
Figure 1-5: Click the readout on 
the status bar, and a pop-up 
menu shows you important 
information about your file.

Figure 1-6: From the pop-up menu on the status 
bar, select commands that provide information 
about your file.

15
 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
 
✓ Scratch Sizes: Displays the amount of memory on your hard drive that’s 
consumed by all documents open in Elements. For example, 20M/200M 
indicates that the open documents consume 20 megabytes and that a 
total of 200 megabytes are available for Elements to edit your images. 
When you add more content to a file, such as new layers, the first figure 
grows while the second figure remains static.
 
✓ Efficiency: Indicates how many operations you’re performing in RAM, as 
opposed to using your scratch disk. When the number is 100%, you’re 
working in RAM. When the number drops below 100%, you’re using the 
scratch disk. If you continually work below 100%, it’s a good indication 
that you need to buy more RAM to increase your efficiency.
 
✓ Timing: Indicates the time it took to complete the last operation.
 
✓ Current Tool: Shows the name of the tool selected from the Tools panel.
Don’t worry about trying to understand all these terms. The important thing 
to know is that you can visit the pop-up menu and change the items at will 
during your editing sessions.
Moving through the menu bar
Like just about every program you launch in Windows, Elements supports 
drop-down menus. The menus are logically constructed and identified to pro-
vide commands for working with your pictures (many commands that you 
don’t find supported in tools and on panels). A quick glimpse at the menu 
names gives you a hint of what might be contained in a given menu list.
Here are the ten different menus:
 
✓ File: Just as you might suspect, the File menu contains commands for 
working with your picture as a file. You find commands in the menu list 
for saving, opening, processing, importing, exporting, and printing. We 
cover saving files in Chapter 3 and printing or exporting for other output 
in Part V.
 
✓ Edit: The old-fashioned Copy, Cut, and Paste commands are located 
in this menu. Additionally, you have some important file settings com-
mands on the menu, including preferences, which we cover in more 
detail in Chapter 2.
 
✓ Image: You use the Image menu most often when you want to effect 
changes to the entire image, such as changing a color mode or crop-
ping, rotating, and resizing the image. For details about sizing and color 
modes, check out Chapter 3. For more about cropping and rotating 
images, flip to Chapter 9.

16
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
✓ Enhance: Just the name of this menu should tell you what commands to 
expect here. This is where you go to change the appearance of an image, 
such as changing its brightness and contrast, adjusting its color and light-
ing, and doing some other smart fix-up work to improve its appearance. 
On the Enhance➪Adjust Color submenu, you find a number of commands 
that offer you a variety of color adjustments. Look to Chapter 10 for some 
detail on correcting color. In Chapters 9 and 10, you can find out how to 
use correction tools so that your images look their best.
 
✓ Layer: As we describe in great detail in Chapter 8 (a whole chapter just 
about layers), most kinds of editing you do in Elements are best handled 
by using layers. Elements neatly tucks away most of the relevant com-
mands associated with working in layers right in this menu.
 
✓ Select: Of just about equal importance to layers are selections. Whereas 
the Image menu contains commands that are applied to the entire 
image, you can edit isolated areas of an image by using the commands 
on the Select menu. To isolate an area, you need to create a selection, as 
we explain in Chapter 7. This menu contains commands to help you with 
many essential tasks related to working with selections.
 
✓ Filter: The Filter menu is where you find some professional photo-
graphic darkroom techniques, or you can completely leave the world of 
photography and explore the world of a fine artist. With tons of different 
filter commands, you can create some extraordinary effects. Find out all 
about filters in Chapter 11.
 
✓ View: Zooming in and out of images, turning on a grid, exposing horizon-
tal and vertical rulers, adding annotations, and checking out the print 
size of your pictures are handled on the View menu. Chapter 5 unearths 
secrets of the Zoom tool, rulers, and more.
 
✓ Window: Elements supports a number of different panels, as we explain 
in the section “Playing with panels,” later in this chapter. Elements 
has so many panels that keeping them all open at one time is impracti-
cal. Thanks to the Window menu, you can easily view and hide panels, 
reopen the Welcome window, tile and cascade open windows, and bring 
inactive windows to the foreground.
 
✓ Help: We hope that you get all the help you need right here in this book; 
but just in case we miss something (or your neighbor has borrowed it, 
fine book that it is), you have some interactive help right at your mouse-
tip on the Help menu. The menu also offers links to the Adobe Web site 
for more information and a little assistance, courtesy of the tutorials 
accessible from this menu. (Find a little more detail about accessing 
help in the section “Getting a Helping Hand,” later in this chapter.)

 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
Uncovering the context menus
Context menus are common to many programs, and Photoshop Elements is 
no exception. They’re those little menus that appear when you right-click 
(Windows) or Control+click (Mac), offering commands and tools related to 
whatever area or tool you right-clicked.
 
The context menus are your solution when you may be in doubt about where 
to find a command on a menu. You just right-click an item, and a pop-up menu 
opens. Before you become familiar with Photoshop Elements and struggle to 
find a menu command, always try to first open a context menu and look for the 
command you want in the menu list.
Because context menus provide commands respective to the tool you’re 
using, the menu commands change according to what tool or feature you’re 
using and where you click at the moment you open a context menu. For 
example, in Figure 1-7, you can see the context menu that appears after we 
create a selection marquee and right-click that marquee in the image window. 
Notice that the commands are all related to selections.
Using the Tools panel
Elements provides a good number of panels for 
different purposes. The one that you’ll find you 
use most is the Tools panel. In panel hierarchy 
terms, you typically first click a tool in the Tools 
panel, and then use another panel for additional 
tool options or use the Options bar (which we 
describe in the section “Selecting tool options in 
the Options bar,” later in the chapter) for fine-
tuning your tool instruments. More often than 
not, clicking a tool in the Tools panel is your first 
step in most editing sessions.
You can easily access tools in Elements by press-
ing shortcut keys on your keyboard. For a quick 
glance at the Tools panel and the keystrokes 
needed to access the tools, look over Figure 1-8.
Notice in the Tools panel that several tools 
appear with a tiny arrow pointing right and downward in the lower-right 
corner of each tool. Whenever you see this arrowhead, remember that more 
tools are nested within that tool group. Click a tool with an arrowhead and 
hold down the mouse button, or for a faster response from Elements, just 
Figure 1-7: A context menu for 
selections.

18
Par t I: Get ting Started 
right-click a tool. A pop-up toolbar opens, as shown in 
Figure 1-9, and offers you more tool selections within 
that group.
To select tools within a tool group by using keystrokes, 
hold down the Shift key and strike the respective key 
(as shown in Figure 1-8) to access the tool. Keep the 
Shift key down and repeatedly press the shortcut key 
to step through all tools in a given group.
 
Whether you have to press the Shift key to select tools 
is controlled by a preference setting. To change the 
default setting so that you don’t have to press Shift, 
choose Edit➪Preferences➪General or press Ctrl/Ô+K.
 
The shortcuts work for you at all times except when 
you’re typing text with the cursor active inside a text 
block. Be certain to click the Tools panel to select a 
tool when you finish editing some text.
The tools are varied, and you may find that you don’t 
use all the tools in the Tools panel in your workflow. 
Rather than describe the tool functions here, we 
address the tools in the rest of this book as they 
pertain to the respective Elements tasks.
Playing with panels
Elements provides you with a bunch of panels that 
contain settings and options used to refine the tools 
you select in the Tools panel and tasks you perform 
to edit images. Assume for a moment that you want to let your creative juices 
loose and create a Picasso-esque painting — something that you can do 
easily in Photoshop Elements.
First, click the Brush tool and then 
click a color in the Color Swatches 
panel. On a new canvas, you begin 
to paint. When you want to change 
color, click again in the Color 
Swatches panel on a different color. 
This kind of interactivity between 
the Tools panel and another panel 
is something you frequently use in 
Elements.

 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
Panels are accessed from either the Panels Bin or the Window menu. Many 
options in panels are intuitive. To become familiar with various panel options, 
just poke around a little, and most of the options will become familiar to you.
Selecting tool options from the Options bar
When you click a tool in the Tools panel, the Options bar offers you choices 
specific to a selected tool. Figure 1-10 shows the options available when the 
Brush tool is selected.
Figure 1-10: The Options bar provides attribute choices for a tool selected in the Tools panel.
Juggling all your interface options
With all the settings you can use for any given tool, trying to figure out 
exactly where to select an option for the edit you want to make can become 
downright frustrating. To help simplify the process of using tools and select-
ing options for the tools, here’s what you might do in your normal workflow:
 
1. Select a tool in the Tools panel.
 
 Obviously, you need to know what task you want to perform, so select-
ing the proper tool to complete the task is important to know up front.
 
2. Take a quick look at the Options bar.
 
 Before moving to other option choices, be certain that you look over the 
choices on the Options bar. If you want to use a tool such as the Brush 
tool or the Clone Stamp tool, perhaps you want to make a decision 
about what size brush tip you want to use. This choice is specific to the 
selected tool and therefore appears as an Options bar choice.
 
3. Open a panel for more options.
 
 If you want to use the Brush tool to apply some color to an image, for 
example, after you select the Brush tip on the Options bar, open the 
Color Swatches panel and select a color.
 
4. Open a drop-down menu.
 
 Not all tools support a drop-down menu in the Options bar. When you 
see a down-pointing arrow, click the arrow to open a menu in which you 
can find more options for some tools.

20
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
5. Get some help.
 
 When you hover your cursor over a tool, you see that tool described 
in blue text. Click the blue text, and your default Web browser opens, 
displaying a page on Adobe’s Web site where help information and tips 
describe using the respective tool. You’ll also find blue text in the More 
menu. The blue text alerts you to help information that can be shown in 
your Web browser.
Try following the same sequence when you want to edit images in Elements 
by first selecting a tool and then checking out the Options bar, opening panels 
related to providing choices for the task at hand, clicking drop-down menus for 
additional choices in the panels, and getting some help when you need it.
Looking at shortcuts
You find the Shortcuts bar to the right of the Options bar and below the Edit, 
Create, and Share buttons. The Shortcuts bar, as shown in Figure 1-11, serves 
several purposes:
 
✓ Quick access to editing tasks: 
Buttons permit you to quickly 
access the Full Edit or Quick 
Edit modes. The Guided button 
is used for accessing step-by-
step instructions on common 
editing tasks.
 
✓ Quick access to other Elements 
functions: Buttons appear for 
quick access to other Elements 
functions that involve creat-
ing calendars, photo collages, 
online galleries, and slide shows. 
The Share button offers many 
options for sharing photos 
online and via e-mail attach-
ments, ordering photo prints 
online, and replicating CD/DVDs.
Depending on your editing mode, such as Full Edit, Quick Edit, or Create and 
Share, the panels change to reflect editing options for a given editing mode.

21
 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
Shortcuts contain tools and buttons grouped as follows:
 
✓ Edit: Click this button to toggle the Full Edit and Quick Edit modes or 
access the Guided Help.
 
✓ Create: Click this button to create Photo Books, Photo Collages, Slide 
Shows, Order Prints, and create Greeting Cards. Click More Options in 
the Create panel to access additional creation options.
 
✓ Share: Click this button to access options that offer many different ways 
to share your photos with others. In the Share panel, you find options 
for creating an Online Album, sending photos via e-mail attachments, 
using Photo Mail, ordering prints online, and writing CDs and DVDs of 
photo collections and slide shows. Clicking More Options in the Share 
panel offers additional options for sharing photos.
Changing Workspaces
When you’re in Full Edit mode, which we discuss in preceding sections, you 
can apply any kind of edits to a picture, improve the picture’s appearance, 
and apply all that Elements offers you. This mode is the richest editor in 
Elements, in terms of accessing all features. Because Elements has so many 
different kinds of editing opportunities, the program offers you other work-
space views, tailored to the kinds of tasks people typically want to perform.
Using Quick Edit mode
Quick Edit mode is designed to provide you with just those tools that you 
need to prepare a picture for its intended destination, whether it’s printing, 
onscreen viewing, or one of the other organizing items. Use this mode to 
make your pictures look good. You don’t find tools for adding text, painting 
with brushes, or applying gradients in Quick Edit mode. Rather, what you 
find is a completely different set of panels for balancing contrast and bright-
ness, lighting, and sharpening, for example. This mode is like having a digital 
darkroom on your desktop, where you take care of perfecting an image like 
you would in analog photography darkrooms.
To enter Quick Edit mode while you’re in Full Edit mode, click the Quick button 
adjacent to the Options bar; the view changes, as shown in Figure 1-12.

22
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
Figure 1-12: Click Quick in Full Edit mode to change the workspace.
Here are several differences between Full Edit mode and Quick Edit mode:
 
✓ Completely different sets of panels are docked in the Panels Bin. All 
the panels in Quick Edit mode are related to adjusting brightness con-
trols and are designed to improve the overall appearance of your pic-
tures. In addition, all the Windows menu commands for accessing panels 
are grayed out. While you work in Quick Edit mode, Elements insists on 
limiting your use of panels to just the ones docked in the Panels Bin. 
Moreover, you can’t undock panels from the Panels Bin by dragging 
them out, as you can in other modes.
 
✓ The Tools panel disappears. Quick Edit mode offers only these tools in 
the Tools panel:
 
• Zoom
 
• Hand
 
• Magic Selection Brush
 
• Crop
 
 None of the other Elements tools is accessible while you work in this mode.

23
 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
 
 If you’ve used an earlier version of Photoshop Elements, you may 
remember that you had a Red Eye Removal tool in the Tools panel in 
Quick Edit mode. The Red Eye Removal tool options are still available in 
Elements 7, but the options appear in only the General Fixes panel.
 
✓ Multiple viewing options are available. Notice in Figure 1-12 that you 
see two views of the same image. The Before view on the left displays 
the raw, unedited image. The After view shows you the results of 
changes you make with panel options and menu commands. You select 
different viewing modes from menu choices in the View drop-down 
menu below the image window.
If you want to return to Full Edit mode, click the Full button.
Using creation tools
To organize your pictures for display in a variety 
of different ways, begin by clicking the Create 
button. The panels in the Panels Bin change to 
support different creation options. Click one of 
the listed options for making a new creation or 
click the More Options button to select from 
additional options. In Figure 1-13, we clicked the 
Create button and then clicked the Photo Collage 
button to start a new creation for a photo col-
lage. As you can see in Figure 1-13, the Panels 
Bin changed to reflect options available to us for 
creating our photo collage.
We cover each option available in the various 
creation panels in greater detail in Chapter 16.
Using the Project Bin
The Project Bin displays thumbnail views of all 
your open images. Regardless of whether you 
work in Full Edit or Quick Edit mode, you can 
immediately see a small image of all the pictures 
you have open at one time, as shown in Figure 
1-14. You can also see thumbnail views of all the 
different views you create for a single picture. 
Find out all the details in the following sections.
If you want to rearrange the thumbnails in the 
Project Bin, click and drag horizontally to reorga-
nize the order of the thumbnails.
Figure 1-13: Click Create and 
then choose an option for the 
type of creation you want to 
edit.

24
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
 
Figure 1-14: All open pictures and new views are displayed as thumbnails in the Project Bin.
Creating different views of an image
What? Different views of the same picture, you say? Yes, indeed. You might 
create a new view when you want to zoom in on an area for some precise 
editing and then want to switch back to a wider view. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Double-click a thumbnail image in the Project Bin.
 
 That photo appears in the image window as the active document.
 
2. Choose View➪New Window for <filename>.
 
 Note that <filename> is the name of the file in the image window.
 
3. Zoom to the new view.
 
 A new view appears for the active document, and you see another 
thumbnail image added to the Project Bin.
 
 To zoom quickly, click the Zoom tool and click a few times on the pic-
ture in the image window to zoom into the photo.
 
4. Toggle views of the same image.
 
 Double-click the original thumbnail to see the opening view; double-click 
the other thumbnail to see the zoomed view.
Hiding the Project Bin
The Project Bin takes up a lot of room at the bottom of the image window, 
and you’re not likely to want it open all the time while editing pictures. 
Fortunately, Elements provides you with several methods for hiding the 
Project Bin when you want to create a little more editing real estate.
To temporarily hide the Project Bin, do one of the following:
 
✓ Place the cursor over the separator bar between the image window and 
the Project Bin. When the cursor changes to two horizontal lines with 
vertical opposing arrowheads, drag down to collapse the Project Bin. 
When the Bin is collapsed, drag up the separator bar to open it.
 
✓ Double-click the separator bar to hide the Project Bin.

25
 Chapter 1: Get ting to Know the Work Area
 
✓ Click the Hide Project Bin text at the bottom of the Project Bin.
 
✓ Open a context menu by right-clicking and select Close at the top of the 
menu.
Using Bin Actions
A nice feature in Elements is the Bin Actions menu at the top of the Project 
Bin. Click Bin Actions to start a new creation, share photos, print all the files 
open in the Bin, and save the Bin files as an album.
To the left of the Bin Actions menu, you’ll find another feature for view-
ing files in Elements. The Show Open Files (shown by default) is another 
drop-down menu that offers the default option for showing open files and 
another choice for showing files from the Organizer. Choose Show Files from 
Organizer to add the files in your Organizer to the Project Bin.
Retracing Your Steps
Ever since Apple’s Macintosh brought a windows interface to the masses, the 
Undo command has been one of the most frequently used menu commands 
in every program developed. You make a change to your document, and if 
you don’t like it, you simply choose Edit➪Undo or press the keyboard short-
cut Ctrl/Ô+Z.
In Elements, your options to undo your work provide you much more than 
reverting back to the last view, as we explain in the following sections.
Using the Undo History panel
Elements takes the Undo command to new levels by offering you a panel in 
which all (well, almost all) your changes in an editing session are recorded 
and available for undoing at any step in an editing sequence.
Each edit you make is recorded in the Undo History panel. To open the panel, 
choose Window➪Undo History. Make changes to your document, and each 
step is recorded in the panel, as you see in Figure 1-15.
 
If Elements slows down and you’re moving along at a snail’s pace, open 
the More fly-away menu in the Undo History panel and choose Clear Undo 
History. Elements flushes all the recorded history and frees up some pre-
cious memory that often enables you to work faster.
We said almost all steps are recorded because the number of steps the 
History panel can record is controlled by a preference setting that tops out 

26
Par t I: Get ting Started 
at 1,000 steps. If you 
choose Edit➪Preferences 
(Windows) and look at the 
Performance preferences, 
as we explain in more 
depth in Chapter 2, the 
number of history states 
(times you can go back in 
history and undo) defaults 
to 50. You can change the 
number to the maximum 
1,000, if you like. But real-
ize that the more history 
states you record, the 
more memory Elements 
requires.
To undo the last edit, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Ô+Z. When you 
want to undo multiple edits, open the Undo History panel and click any item 
listed in the panel. Elements takes you to that last edit while scrubbing all edits 
that follow the selected item. If you want to bring back the edits, just click 
again on any step appearing grayed out in the panel to redo up to that level.
All your steps are listed in the Undo History panel as long as you remain in 
Elements and don’t close the file. When the file is closed, all history informa-
tion is lost.
Reverting to the last save
While you work away in Elements, always plan on saving your work regularly. 
Each time you save in an editing session, the Undo History panel preserves 
the list of edits you made before the save and up to the maximum number of 
history states defined in the General preferences.
If you save, then perform more edits, and then want to return to the last 
saved version of your document, Elements provides you with a quick, effi-
cient way to do so. If you choose Edit➪Revert, Elements eliminates your new 
edits and takes you back to the last time you saved your file.
When you choose Revert, Revert appears in the Undo History panel. You can 
eliminate the Revert command from the Undo History panel by right-clicking 
Revert in the Undo History panel and choosing Delete from the context menu 
that appears. This command returns you to the edits made after the last save.
Figure 1-15: The Undo History panel is shown with the fly-
away menu open.

Getting a Helping Hand
You can reach for this book whenever you want some details about accom-
plishing a task while working in Elements. However, for those little annoy-
ing moments, and just in case some coffee stains blot out a few pages in 
this book, you may want to look for an alternative feature description from 
another source.
Rather than accumulate a library of Elements books, all you need to do is look 
at Elements itself to find some valuable help information quickly and easily. If 
you’re stuck on understanding some feature, ample help documents that are a 
mouse click away can help you overcome some frustrating moments.
Using Help
Your first stop in exploring the helpful information Elements provides is on 
the Help menu. In this menu, you can find several menu commands that offer 
information:
 
✓ Photoshop Elements Help: Choose Help➪Photoshop Elements Help or 
press the F1 key to open the Elements Help file. You can type a search 
topic and press Enter to open a list of items that provide helpful infor-
mation about the searched words.
 
 For quick access to the Help document, type the text you want to search 
into the text box on the right side of the menu bar in Full Edit or Quick 
Edit mode.
 
✓ Glossary of Terms: While you read this book, if we use a term that you 
don’t completely understand, open the Photoshop Elements glossary. 
In this glossary, you can find definitions of terms commonly used in 
photography and image editing, as well as terms related specifically to 
Elements.
 
✓ Online Support: This menu command launches your default Web 
browser and takes you to the Adobe Web site, where you can find 
information about Elements, problems reported by users, and some 
work-around methods for getting a job done. Additional Web assisted 
help information is available by clicking Photoshop Elements Online and 
Online Learning Resources. The vast collection of Web pages on Adobe’s 
Web site offers you assistance, tips and techniques, and solutions to 
many problems that come with editing images. Be sure to spend some 
time browsing these Web pages.

Using PDFs from the installation CD
A number of bonus files are stored in PDF form on your installation CD. 
PDF files require the free Adobe Reader program or one of the commercial 
Acrobat viewers. Adobe Reader can be installed from the CD during the 
installation process.
Depending on when you purchased your Elements installer CD, the version of 
Adobe Reader on the CD may be outdated. If you want to stay with the latest 
upgrade of Adobe Reader, open your Web browser and type this address in 
the address bar:
www.adobe.com/products/reader
Adobe Systems provides easy, step-by-step instructions for downloading the 
most current, free Adobe Reader program and installing it on your computer.
 
If you haven’t upgraded to at least Adobe Reader 9, be sure to download the 
most recent version of Adobe Reader. Adobe Reader 9 and higher provide 
you with some direct connections to Acrobat.com, where you can expand 
your Photoshop.com storage space to over 7GB (gigabytes). Look at Chapter 
16, in which we talk about using Photoshop.com and expanding your online 
libraries with Acrobat.com.
Using ToolTips
While you move your cursor around tools and panels, pause a moment 
before clicking the mouse. A slight delay in your actions produces a ToolTip. 
Elements provides this sort of dynamic help when you pause the cursor 
before moving to another location.

▶ Specifying editing preferences
▶ Specifying organizing preferences
▶ Working with presets
▶ Understanding color in Photoshop Elements
▶ Setting up your color management system
A
lthough not as exciting as firing up Elements and working on your pre-
cious pictures, customizing Elements for your personal work habits 
and properly setting up color management is critical to everything else you 
do in the program. This chapter explains how to take charge of Elements and 
customize your work environment by adjusting preference settings and set-
ting up a color management system. If you’re new to Elements or 
image editing in general, you might not know just how you 
want to set up certain features right away. However, you 
can always refer to this chapter when you review and 
update settings and options later, after you become 
familiar with other features in Elements.
Controlling the Editing 
Environment
Opening Elements for the first time is like moving 
into a new office. Before you begin work, you need to 
organize the office. At minimum, you need to set up the 
desk and computer before you can do anything. In Elements 
terms, the office organization consists of specifying Preferences 
settings. Preferences are settings that provide a means to customize 
your work in Elements and to fine-tune the program according to your 
personal work habits.
What we offer in the following sections is a brief description of the preference 
options available to you. When you need some detail regarding one preference 

30
Par t I: Get ting Started 
option or another, look at the help documents we discuss in Chapter 1. If you 
use the help documents as a reference, you won’t need to memorize the vast 
number of settings Elements provides.
Launching and navigating Preferences
Preferences are all contained in a dialog box that’s organized into nine panes. 
By default, when you open the Preferences dialog box, the opening pane is the 
General pane. To open the Preferences dialog box, choose Edit➪Preferences➪
General. Alternatively, press Ctrl/Ô+K. Using either method opens the 
Preferences dialog box to the General pane, as shown in Figure 2-1.
 
 
Figure 2-1: The General pane in the Preferences dialog box.
In Figure 2-1, you see items that are common to all preference panes. Here’s a 
quick introduction to what these items are and how they work:
 
✓ Panes list: Elements lists all the different panes in the Preferences dialog 
box along the left side of the dialog box. Click an item in the list to make 
the respective pane open on the right side of the dialog box. In earlier 
versions of Elements, you had a drop-down menu where you selected 
the different panes.
 
✓ OK: Click OK to accept any changes made in any pane and dismiss the 
Preferences dialog box.
 
✓ Cancel: Click Cancel to return to the same settings as when you opened 
a pane, and it dismisses the dialog box. If you hold down the Alt key, the 

31
 Chapter 2: Get ting Ready to Edit
Cancel button changes to Reset, and clicking that button performs the 
same action as clicking the Reset button.
 
✓ Reset: If you change the settings options and click Reset, the action 
takes you back to the same settings as when you opened the Preferences 
dialog box, and the dialog box remains open.
 
✓ Prev: Switch to the previous pane.
 
✓ Next: Switch to the next pane. You can also press Ctrl/Ô+(1 through 9 keys) 
to jump to another pane. Ctrl /Ô+0 opens the Organizer workspace and its 
Preferences dialog box when you’re in the Edit mode Preferences dialog box.
Checking out all the Preferences panes
The settings in the Preferences dialog box are organized into different panes 
that reflect key categories of preferences. The following list briefly describes 
the types of settings you can adjust in each of the Preferences panes:
 
✓ General preferences, as the name implies, apply to overall general 
settings you adjust for your editing environment.
 
✓ Saving Files preferences relate to options available for saving files. You 
can choose to add extensions to filenames, save files with layers or flat-
ten layers when you’re saving a file (as we explain in Chapter 8), save 
files with image previews that appear when you’re viewing files as icons 
on your desktop, and save with some compatibility options.
 
✓ Performance preferences is the pane where you find history states 
(explained in Chapter 1) and memory settings, such as scratch disk 
settings. (See the sidebar “What’s a scratch disk?” below for more on 
scratch disks.)
 
 Don’t use USB 1.1 external hard drives or other drives that have connec-
tions slower than USB 2 or FireWire. Using slower drives slows the per-
formance of Elements.
What’s a scratch disk?
Assume that you have 100 megabytes (MB) of 
free RAM (your internal computer memory) and 
you want to work on a picture that consumes 
200MB of hard disk space. Elements needs to 
load all 200MB of the file into RAM. Therefore, 
an auxiliary source of RAM is needed in order 
for you to work on the image; Elements uses 
your hard drive. When a hard drive is used as an 
extension of RAM, this source is a scratch disk.
If you have more than one hard drive connected 
to your computer, you can instruct Elements to 
use all hard drives, and you can select the order 
of the hard drives that Elements uses for your 
extension of RAM. All disks and media sources 
appear in a list as 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on.

32
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
✓ Display & Cursors preferences offer options for how certain tool cursors are 
displayed and how you view the Crop tool when you’re cropping images.
 
✓ Transparency preferences require an understanding of how Elements 
represents transparency. Imagine painting a portrait on a piece of clear 
acetate. The area you paint is opaque, and the area surrounding the por-
trait is transparent. To display transparency in Elements, you need some 
method to represent transparent areas. (Chapter 7 has more details.) Open 
the Transparency preferences and make choices for how transparency is 
displayed in your 2-D Elements environment.
 
✓ Units & Rulers preferences let you specify settings for ruler units, 
column guides, and document preset resolutions.
 
✓ Grid preferences offer options for gridline color, divisions, and subdivi-
sions. A grid shows you nonprinting horizontal and vertical lines. You 
use a grid to align objects, type, and other elements. You can snap items 
to the gridlines to make aligning objects much easier.
 
✓ Plug-Ins preferences contain options for selecting an additional Plug-Ins 
folder for storing third-party utilities to work with Elements.
 
✓ Type preferences provide options for setting text attributes. You have 
options for using different quote marks, showing Asian characters, 
showing font names in English, and previewing font sizes.
Controlling the Organizing Environment
 
A whole different set of Preferences appears when you open the Organizer 
and choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl/Ô+K. Initially, you may be con-
fused because the dialog box that opens when you work in the Organizer is 
also named Preferences. However, a quick glance at the dialog box shows 
you a different set of Preferences choices. In the following sections, you can 
find a brief introduction to the Organizer and discover all the different orga-
nization preferences that Elements has to offer.
 
When you open the Full Edit or Quick Fix mode and press Ctrl/Ô+K to 
open the Preferences dialog box, pressing Ctrl/Ô+K+0 (zero) opens the 
Organizer Preferences. After you make a preference adjustment in the Organizer 
Preferences and click OK, or you click Cancel to dismiss the dialog box, you are 
returned to the Editing mode’s Preferences dialog box.
Understanding the Photoshop Elements Organizer
We cover all you need to know about the wonderful Adobe Photoshop Elements 
Organizer environment in Chapter 6, so we don’t describe in this chapter all that 
the Organizer offers you. Just be aware that when you’re setting the Organizer pref-
erences, you’re setting preference options for the Organizer only. To take a quick 
peek at the Organizer, click the Organize button while in Edit or Quick Edit mode.

33
 Chapter 2: Get ting Ready to Edit
Navigating Organizer preferences
You can open the Organizer Preferences dialog box after opening the 
Organizer. Users of Elements versions earlier than Elements 6 are familiar 
with an option to select Organizer Preferences while in the Edit Preferences 
dialog box. This choice was removed from the Edit Preferences in Photoshop 
Elements 6 and hasn’t reappeared in Elements 7; however, you can use a 
keyboard shortcut to open the Organizer Preferences dialog box. Press 
Ctrl/Ô+0 (zero) to open the Organizer from within a Preferences dialog 
box in either editor to gain access to the Organizer Preferences dialog box. 
Alternately, you can choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl/Ô+K in the 
Organizer window to open the Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2.
 
 
 Figure 2-2: Choose Edit➪Preferences and select a submenu item to open the 
Organizer Preferences dialog box.
The Organizer Preferences dialog box uses the same metaphor to toggle through 
a number of panes that the Edit Preferences dialog box uses. Click the names 
in the list on the left side of the dialog box to open the respective panes on the 
right side of the dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog box, you find items that 
are common to all panes in the Preferences dialog box. These include
 
✓ Restore Default Settings: Click Restore Default Settings to change all 
panes to their original defaults.
 
✓ OK: Click OK to accept new changes.

Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
✓ Cancel: Click Cancel in any pane, and any changes you made aren’t 
registered.
 
✓ Help: Click Help to open the Help window and find information about 
Organize & Share preferences.
Setting preferences in all the panes
With the Organizer Preferences dialog box open, here’s a quick overview of 
what you find there:
 
✓ General preferences: These items affect a miscellaneous group of settings 
that are applied to files when you’re using the Create tool. Chapter 16 
explains this tool in detail.
 
✓ Files preferences: Offers options for managing file data, connecting to 
missing files, prompting to back up your data, saving catalogs, choos-
ing file and folder locations for saved files, rotating images, burning CD/
DVDs, and handling preview sizes.
 
✓ Folder Location View preferences: Provides options for showing files 
and folders in groups and selected folders.
 
✓ Editing preferences: You can enable another application that provides 
some editing features not found in Elements to edit an image based on 
its file type. One good example for adding another editor is when you’re 
editing video clips. If you have Adobe Premiere Elements, you can add 
Premiere as another editor. If you don’t have Premiere installed, you can 
use another editor, such as Microsoft Media Maker.
 
✓ Camera or Card Reader preferences: Handle acquiring images from 
digital cameras and media storage cards. Your computer may have 
built-in card readers in which you can insert a media card, such as 
CompactFlash or Smart Media, or a USB card reader that supports a 
media card. In other cases, you may have a cable that connects from 
your camera to a USB port on your computer. These preference options

Customizing Presets
Part of the fun of image editing is choosing brush tips, swatch colors, gradi-
ent colors, and patterns to create the look you want. To get you started, 
Elements provides you with a number of different preset libraries that can be 
loaded and used at your will. For example, you can load a Brushes library to 
acquire different brush tips you use with the Brush tool. But you’re likely to 
want to customize the preset libraries at least a little bit, too.
You can change libraries individually 
in respective panels where the items 
are used. For example, you can change 
color swatch libraries on the Color 
Swatches panel or brush tips libraries 
from Options bar choices. Another way 
you can change libraries is to use the 
Preset Manager, as shown in Figure 2-3.
We cover using the presets in 
Chapter 12, which is where you can 
find out how to use the many differ-
ent presets that Elements provides. 
The important thing to note here 
is that you can change the presets 
according to your editing needs.
To open the Preset Manager dialog box, choose Edit➪Preset Manager. The 
options you have available include
 
✓ Learn More about: The Preset Manager: Click the blue Preset Manager 
hyperlinked text to open the Help document and find out more about 
managing presets.
 
✓ Preset Type: Open the drop-down menu to choose from Brushes, 
Swatches, Gradients, and Patterns.
 
✓ More: The More drop-down menu lists different viewing options. You 
can view the library items as text lists or as thumbnail views.
 
✓ Done: Any changes you make in the Preset Manager are recorded and 
saved when you click Done.

Getting Familiar with Color
We could spend a whole lot of time and many pages in this book delving into 
the complex world of color theory and definitions. You wouldn’t likely read 
it, and we’re not so inclined to reduce this book from a real page-turner to 
something that’s likely to sedate you. Rather, in the following sections, we 
offer some fundamental principles to make your work in Elements easier 
when you’re editing color images.
Introducing color channels
Your first level of understanding color is to understand what RGB is and how 
it comes about. RGB stands for red, green, and blue. These are the primary 
colors in the computer world. Forget about what you know about primary 
colors in an analog world; computers see primary colors as RGB.
RGB color is divided into color channels. Although you can’t see the individ-
ual channels in Elements, you still need to understand just a little about color 
channels.
When you see a color pixel (a tiny, square dot), the color is represented as 
different levels of gray in each channel. This may sound confusing at first, 
but stay with us for just a minute. When you have a color channel, such as 
the red channel, and you let all light pass through the channel, you end up 
with a bright red. If you screen that light a little with a gray filter, you let less 
light pass through, thereby diluting the red color. This is how channels work. 
Individually, they all use different levels of gray that permit up to 256 levels 
of light to pass through them. When you change the intensity of light in the 
different channels, you ultimately change the color.

37
 Chapter 2: Get ting Ready to Edit
Each channel can have up to 256 levels of gray that mask out light. The total 
number of possibilities for creating color in an RGB model is achieved by 
multiplying the values for each channel (256 × 256 × 256). The result is more 
than 16.7 million; that’s the total number of colors a computer monitor can 
display in RGB color.
This is all well and good as far as 
theory goes, but what does that 
mean in practicality? Actually, you 
see some of this information in 
tools and dialog boxes you work 
with in Elements. As an experiment, 
open a file in Elements and choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels; 
the dialog box shown in Figure 2-4 
opens.
Notice that the Channel drop-down 
menu shows you Red, Green, and 
Blue as individual channels, as 
well as a composite RGB selection. 
Furthermore, the Output Levels 
area shows you values ranging from 
0 on the left to 255 on the right. 
Considering that 0 is a number, you 
have a total of 256 different levels of gray.
 
What’s important is that you know that your work in color is related to RGB 
images that comprise three different channels. There are 256 levels of gray 
that can let through or hold back light and change brightness values and 
color. See Chapters 9 and 10 for more on using tools, such as levels, to adjust 
color in this way.
Understanding bit depth
Another important item to understand about channels is bit depth. A bit holds 
one of two values; one value is for black, the other for white. When you have 
256 levels of gray, you’re working with an 8-bit-per-channel image — 8 bits with 
two possible values each is 28, or 256, possible levels of gray. Multiply 8 bits 
per channel times your 3 channels, and you get 24 bits, which is the common 
bit depth of images you print on your desktop printer.
Now, take a look at the Image➪Mode menu. You should see a menu selection 
that says 8 Bits/Channel, as shown in Figure 2-5. When you open an image in 
Elements, if this menu command is grayed out, you’re working with a 24-bit 
image, or an image of 8 bits per channel.
Figure 2-4: Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels to open the Levels dialog box.

38
Par t I: Get ting Started 
What does it mean when you can 
select the 8 Bits/Channel menu 
command? You can be certain that 
your image isn’t an 8-bit-per-channel 
image. You may be able to select this 
command because some digital cam-
eras and most low-end, consumer-
grade scanners can capture images 
at higher bit depths. You can scan 
a photo on a scanner at 16 bits per 
channel. When you do, you end up 
with many more levels of gray. When 
you take a picture with a quality digi-
tal camera, you can capture 32-bit-
per-channel images, and you end up 
with a file containing 32,768 levels of 
gray. That’s a lot!
Now, here’s the catch. All files need to be reduced to 8 bits per channel 
before you print them because that’s all the information any printer uses. In 
addition, many tools, commands, and panel options work only with 8-bit-per-
channel images. So, you ask, “What’s the benefit of acquiring images at higher 
bit depths than I can print them?”
 
If you attempt to adjust brightness and contrast, or other image enhance-
ments, in an 8-bit-per-channel image, you often destroy some data. You can 
cause some noticeable image degradation if you move adjustment sliders too 
far while working with 8-bit-per-channel images. When you edit your 16-bit 
and 32-bit images, you don’t destroy data — you simply inform Elements 
which 256 of the total available levels of gray you want to use. The result is 
an image with more continuous gray tones than you can achieve in 8-bit-per-
channel images. (For more on image bit-depth, see Chapter 3.)
Getting Color Right
In Elements, when it comes to color, the challenge isn’t understanding color 
theory or definitions, but rather matching the RGB color you see on your 
computer monitor as closely as possible to your output. Output can be a 
printout from a color printer or a screen view on a Web page.
We say match “as closely as possible” because you can’t expect to achieve 
an exact match. You have far too many printer and monitor variables to deal 
with. However, if you properly manage color, you can get a very close match.
Figure 2-5: When you can choose 8 Bits/
Channel, your image bit depth is higher than 
8 bits per channel.

39
 Chapter 2: Get ting Ready to Edit
To match color between your monitor and your output, you need to first cali-
brate your monitor and then choose a color workspace profile. In the follow-
ing sections, you can find all the details.
Calibrating your monitor
Your monitor needs to be calibrated to adjust the gamma and brightness, 
correct any color tints or colorcasts, and generally get your monitor to dis-
play, as precisely as possible, accurate colors on your output. You have a 
few choices for which tool you can use to adjust monitor brightness, ranging 
from a low-cost hardware device that sells for less than $100 to expensive 
calibration equipment of $3,000 or more — or you can skip the hardware and 
use tools provided by Adobe or Windows.
 
Gamma is the brightness of midlevel tones in an image. In technical terms, 
it’s a parameter that describes the shape of the transfer function for one or 
more stages in an imaging pipeline.
We skip the high-end costly devices and software utilities that don’t do you 
any good and suggest that you make, at the very least, one valuable purchase 
for creating a monitor profile: a hardware profiling system. On the low end, 
some affordable devices go a long way in helping you adjust your monitor 
brightness and color balance:
 
✓ ColorVision Spyder2express: This is a calibration device on the market. 
For as low as $64, you can purchase an easy-to-use, three-step device to 
balance the color on your monitor and adjust it for optimum brightness. 
This device is receiving five-star ratings at online resellers, including 
www.amazon.com.
 
✓ Pantone Huey Monitor Color Correction: This is another, low-cost 
calibration system used for calibrating both CRTs and LCDs. This unit 
retails for $89 and sells for $63 at Amazon.com, as of this writing.
 
✓ X-Rite Eye-One Display 2 (formerly GreTag MacBeth Eye-One Display 2): 
This device, like the Spyder2express and Huey, is an easy-to-use profil-
ing tool that works with CRT displays, LCDs, and laptop computers. It 
sells for around $195 to $250. You attach the suction cup to your moni-
tor (see Figure 2-6) and click a few buttons in the software application 
accompanying the hardware, and Eye-One Display 2 eventually prompts 
you to save a monitor profile. The profile you create is used automati-
cally by your operating system when you start your computer. When 
the profile kicks in, your monitor is balanced with the settings that were 
determined when the device performed the calibration.
On LCD monitors, you need to adjust some of the hardware controls to bring 
your monitor into a match for overall brightness with your photo prints. Be 

40
Par t I: Get ting Started 
certain to run many test prints and 
match your prints against your moni-
tor view to make the two as similar 
as possible.
You have a lot to focus on to cali-
brate monitors and get color right 
on your monitor and your output. 
We talk more about color output in 
Chapter 14. For a good resource for 
color correction and printing using 
Photoshop Elements, we recommend 
that you look at Color Management 
For Digital Photographers For Dummies, 
by Ted Padova and Don Mason 
(Wiley).
Choosing a color workspace
After you get your monitor color adjusted by using a hardware profiling 
system, your next step is to choose your color workspace. In Elements, you 
have a choice between one of two workspace colors: either sRGB or Adobe 
RGB (1998). You access your color workspace settings by choosing Edit➪Color 
Settings. The Color Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 2-7.

device.

41
 Chapter 2: Get ting Ready to Edit
The options you have in the Color Settings dialog box include
 
✓ No Color Management: This choice turns off all color management. 
Don’t choose this option for any work you do in Elements. When using 
No Color Management, you need to work with files that have color profiles 
embedded in the photos. Most likely you won’t be using these types of 
photos. For information related to when you might use the option, see 
Chapter 14.
 
✓ Always Optimize Colors for Computer Screens: Checking this radio 
button sets your workspace to sRGB. sRGB color is used quite often for 
viewing images on your monitor. But this workspace often results in the 
best choice for color printing, too. Many color printers can output all 
the colors you can see in the sRGB workspace. In addition, many photo 
services, such as the Kodak EasyShare services we talk about in Chapter 
16, prefer this workspace color.
 
✓ Always Optimize for Printing: Checking this option sets your color 
workspace to Adobe RGB (1998). The color in this workspace has more 
available colors than can be seen on your monitor. If you choose this 
workspace, you need to be certain that your printer is capable of using 
all the colors in this color space.
 
✓ Allow Me to Choose: When you choose this option, Elements prompts 
you for a profile assignment when you open images that contain no pro-
file. This setting is handy if you work back and forth between screen and 
print images.
Understanding how profiles work
You probably created a monitor color profile when you calibrated your moni-
tor. You probably also selected a color profile when you opened the Color 
Settings dialog box and selected your workspace color. When you start your 
computer, your monitor color profile kicks in and adjusts your overall moni-
tor brightness and correction for any colorcasts. When you open a photo in 
Elements, color is automatically converted from your monitor color space to 
your workspace color.
At print time, you use another color profile to output your photos to your 
desktop color printer. Color is then converted from your workspace color to 
your printer’s color space. In Chapter 14, we show you how to use color pro-
files for printing. For now, just realize that each one of these color profiles, 
and using them properly, determines whether you can get good color output.

Working with Resolutions, Color 
Modes, and File Formats
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding and changing resolution
▶ Resampling images
▶ Understanding color modes
▶ Working with file formats
W
hen you open a picture in Photoshop Elements, you’re looking at 
a huge mass of pixels. These pixels are tiny, colored squares, and 
the number of pixels in a picture determines the picture’s resolution. This 
relationship between pixels and resolution, which is important for 
you to understand in all your Elements work, relates to creat-
ing selections (as we explain in Chapter 7), printing files 
(Chapter 14), and sharing files (Chapter 16).
Color modes are also represented as collections of 
pixels. Color modes are important when you’re 
using tools, and printing and sharing files.
This chapter explains some essential points about 
resolution, color modes, and the file formats you 
use to save your Elements images. We talk about 
changing resolution by resizing images, converting 
color modes, and saving the results in different file 
formats.
The Ubiquitous Pixels
Files you open in Elements are composed of millions of tiny, square pixels. 
Each pixel has one, and only one, color value. The arrangement of the pixels 
of different shades and colors creates an illusion to your eyes when you’re 

44
Par t I: Get ting Started 
viewing an image onscreen. For example, you may have black and white pixels 
arranged in an order that creates the impression that you’re looking at some-
thing gray — not at tiny black and white squares.
Just about everything you do in Elements has to do with changing pixels. You 
surround them with selection tools to select what appear to be objects in 
your image; you make pixels darker or lighter to change contrast and bright-
ness; you change shades and tints of pixels for color correction; and you per-
form a host of other editing possibilities.
We also have another term to throw at you when talking about pixels and 
Elements files: Your pictures are raster images. When you have pixels, you 
have raster data. If you open a file in Elements that isn’t made of pixels, 
Elements rasterizes the data. In other words, Elements converts other data 
to pixels if the document wasn’t originally composed of pixels.
 
You can also have vector content in an Elements file. Text added with the 
Type Tool, for example, is a vector object. When you save an Elements file 
with the Text layer intact or save as a Photoshop PDF file, the vector data is 
maintained. We talk more about vector data in Chapter 13. For this chapter, 
you just need to focus on raster data.
 
To use most of the tools and commands in Elements, you must be working 
on a raster image file. If your data isn’t rasterized, many tools and commands 
are unavailable.
Understanding resolution
The number of pixels in a file determines its image resolution. If you have 72 
pixels across a 1-inch horizontal line, your image is 72 pixels per inch (ppi). If 
you have 300 pixels in 1 inch, your image resolution is 300 ppi.
 
Image resolution is critical to properly outputting files in these instances:
 
✓ When you print images: If the resolution is too low, the image prints 
poorly. If the image resolution is too high, you waste time processing all 
the data that needs to be sent to your printer.
 
✓ When you show images onscreen: Just like images have resolution 
inherent in their files, your computer monitor displays everything you 
see on it in a fixed resolution. Computer monitors display images at 72 
ppi (or 85 or 96 ppi). That’s all you get. What’s important to know is that 
you can always best view photos on your computer monitor at a 72-ppi 
image size in a 100-percent view.

45
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
 
 As an example, take a look at Figure 3-1. You see an image reduced to 
50 percent and then at different zoom sizes. When the size changes, 
the resolution display on your monitor changes. When the size is 100 
percent, you see the image exactly as it will print. The 100-percent size 
represents the image displayed on your monitor at 72 ppi, regardless of 
the resolution of the file.
This relationship between the image resolution and viewing the image at 
different zoom levels is an important concept to grasp. If you grab an image 
off the Web and zoom in on it, you may see a view like the 800-percent view 
shown in Figure 3-1. If you acquire a digital camera image, you may need to 
zoom out to a 16-percent view to fit the entire image in the Image window.
The reason that these displays vary so much is all image resolution. That 
Web page image you grabbed off the Web might be a 2-inch-square image at 
72 ppi, and that digital camera image might be a 10-x-15-inch image at 240 ppi. 
To fill the entire window with the Web image, you need to zoom in on the file. 
When you zoom in, the resolution is lowered. The more you zoom, the lower 
the resolution on your monitor.

100%

Figure 3-1: The same image is viewed at different zoom levels.

46
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
When you zoom into or out of an image, you change the resolution as it 
appears on your monitor. No resolution changes are made to the file. The 
image resolution remains the same until you use one of the Elements tools 
to reduce or add to image resolution.
Understanding image dimensions
Image dimensions involve the physical size of your file. If the size is 4 x 5 
inches, for example, the file can be any number of different resolution values. 
After the file is open in Elements, you can change the dimensions of an image, 
the resolution, or both.
When you change only the dimensions of an image (not the number of 
pixels it contains), an inverse relationship exists between the physical size 
of your image and the resolution. When image size is increased, resolution 
decreases. Conversely, when you raise resolution, you lower image size.
The Art of Resampling
In some cases, images are too large, and you need to reduce their resolu-
tion and physical size. In other cases, you might need a higher resolution 
to output your images at larger sizes. This method of sizing — changing the 
size, as well as the number of pixels — is resampling an image.
 
Specifically, reducing resolution is downsampling, and raising resolution is 
upsampling.
Use caution when you resample images; when you resample, you toss away 
pixels or manufacture new pixels. We discuss the sampling details in the sec-
tion “Understanding the results of resampling,” later in this chapter.
Changing image size and resolution
You can change an image’s size and resolution in a couple different ways. 
One method is cropping images. You can use the Crop tool with or without 
resampling images. For more information on using the Crop tool, see Chapter 
9. Another method is using the Image Size dialog box, which you use in many 
of your editing sessions in Elements.
To resize an image with the Image Size dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl/Ô+Alt+I. The 
Image Size dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 3-2.

47
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
 
 The Pixel Dimensions area in the Image Size dialog box shows the file 
size (such as 23.4M). This number is the amount of space the image 
takes up on your hard drive. The width and height values are fixed 
unless you click the Resample 
Image check box at the bottom 
of the dialog box.
 
2. In the Document Size area, you 
can redefine dimensions and 
resolution. The options are
 
• Width: Type a value in 
the text box to resize the 
image’s width and then 
press Tab to move out of 
the field to implement the 
change. From the drop-
down menu to the right 
of the text box, you can 
choose a unit of measure: 
percent, inches, centime-
ters, millimeters, points, 
picas, or columns.
 
• Height: The Height options 
are the same as the Width options with the exception of no column 
setting. If you keep the sizing proportional, you typically edit either 
the Width or Height text box, but not both. When you alter either 
width or height, the resolution changes inversely.
 
• Resolution: Edit the text box to change resolution, and press 
the Tab key to change the value. When resolution is edited, the 
Width and Height values are changed inversely (if the Constrain 
Proportions check box is checked).
 
3. If you’re okay with resampling your image to get the desired size, 
select the Resample Image check box.
 
 With this check box selected, you can change dimensions and pixels at 
the same time, which results in reducing or increasing the number of 
pixels. When the box is unchecked, the values for dimensions are linked. 
Changing one value automatically changes the other values.
 
 Before you resample your image, however, be sure to check out the 
following section.
 
4. If you select the Resample Image check box, you can choose a 
resampling method, as well as other resample options.
Figure 3-2: Choose Image➪Resize➪Image Size 
to open the Image Size dialog box.

48
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
 In the drop-down list, you find resampling-method choices. See Table 3-1 
for details. The two check boxes above the Resample Image check box 
become active when you select the Resample Image box. Here’s what 
they do:
 
• Scale Styles: Elements has a Styles panel from which you can add 
a variety of different style effects to images. (See Chapter 11 for 
details.) When you apply a style, such as a frame border, the 
border appears at a defined width. When you select the Scale 
Styles box and then resize the image, the Styles effect is also 
resized. Leaving the check box unselected keeps the style at the 
same size while the image is resized.
 
• Constrain Proportions: By default, this check box is selected, and 
you want to keep it that way unless you want to intentionally dis-
tort an image.
 
5. When you’re done selecting your options, click OK to resize your image.

This method is best used when 
you have large areas of the

You might use this option with 
grayscale images and line art.

This method is the default 
and provides a good-quality 
image.
Unless you find better results by 
using any of the other methods, 
leave the default at Bicubic.
Bicubic 
Smoother
This method improves on 
the Bicubic method, but you 
notice a little softening of 
the edges.
If sharpness isn’t critical and you 
find Bicubic not quite doing the 
job, try this method. This method 
tends to work best if you have to 
upsample an image.

Sharper
This method produces good-
quality images and sharpens 
the results.
Downsample high-resolution 
images that need to be output 
to screen resolutions and Web 
pages.
Understanding the results of resampling
As a general rule, reducing resolution is okay, but increasing resolution 
isn’t. If you need a higher-resolution image and you can go back to the origi-
nal source (such as rescanning the image or reshooting a picture), try (if 
you can) to create a new file that has the resolution you want, instead of 

49
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
resampling in Elements. In some cases, upsampled images can be severely 
degraded.
If you take a picture with a digital 
camera and want to add the picture 
to a Web page, the image needs to be 
sampled at 72 ppi. In most cases, you 
visit the Image Size dialog box, select 
the Resample Image check box, add 
a width or height value, and type 72 
in the Resolution text box. What you 
end up with is an image that looks 
great on your Web page. In Figure 3-3, 
you can see an image that was down-
sampled in Elements from over 14 
inches horizontal width.
 
If you start with an image that was 
originally sampled for a Web page 
and you want to print a large 
poster, you can forget about using 
Elements or any other image editor. 
Upsampling low-resolution images 
often turns them to mush, as you 
can see in Figure 3-4.
You might wonder whether upsam-
pling can be used for any purpose. In 
some cases, yes, you can upsample 
with some satisfactory results. You 
can experience better results with 
higher resolutions of 300 ppi and 
more if the resample size isn’t extraordinary. If all else fails, try applying a filter 
to a grainy, upsampled image to mask the problem. Chapter 11 has more 
on filters.
Choosing a Resolution for Print or Onscreen
The importance of resolution in your Elements work is paramount to print-
ing files. Good ol’ 72-ppi images can be forgiving, and you can get many of 
your large files scrunched down to 72 ppi for Web sites and slide shows. 
With output to printing devices, it’s another matter. There are many different 
printing output devices, and their resolution requirements vary.
For your own desktop printer, plan to print a variety of test images at differ-
ent resolutions. You can quickly determine the best file attributes by running 
tests. When you send files to service centers, ask the technicians what file 
attributes work best with their equipment.
Figure 3-3: Downsampling images most often 
produces satisfactory results.

often produces severely degraded results.

Go Ahead — Make My Mode!
Regardless of what output you prepare your files for, you need to consider 
color mode and file format. In Chapter 2, we talk about RGB (red, green, and 
blue) color mode. This color mode is what you use to prepare color files for 
printing on your desktop color printer or for preparing files for photo service 
centers.
You can also use color modes other than RGB. If you start with an RGB color 
image and want to convert to a different color mode, you have menu options 
for converting color. Photoshop Elements uses an algorithm (a mathematical 
formula) to convert pixels from one mode to another. In some cases, the con-
version that’s made via a menu command produces good results, and in other 
cases, you can use some different options for converting modes.
In the following sections, we introduce the modes that are available in 
Elements and explain how to convert from RGB to the mode of your choice: 
bitmap, grayscale, or indexed color.
 
Another mode you may have heard of is CMYK. Although CMYK mode isn’t 
available in Photoshop Elements, you should be aware of what it is and the 
purposes of CMYK images. CMYK, commonly referred to as process color, 
contains percentages of cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colors. This mode 
is used for commercial printing. If you design a magazine cover in Elements 
and send the file to a print shop, the file is ultimately converted to CMYK. 
Also note that most desktop printers use different ink sets within the CMYK 
color space.

 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Converting to Bitmap mode
Bitmap mode is most commonly used in printing line art, such as black-and-
white logos, illustrations, or black-and-white effects that you create from 
your RGB images. Also, you can scan your analog signature as a bitmap image 
and import it into other programs, such as the Microsoft Office programs. If 
you’re creative, you can combine bitmap images with RGB color to produce 
many interesting effects.
 
The Elements Bitmap mode isn’t the same as the Windows .bmp file format. 
In Elements, Bitmap mode is a color mode. A .bmp file can be an RGB color 
mode image, a Grayscale color mode image, or a Bitmap color mode image.
 
One important thing to keep in mind is that when you combine images into 
single documents, as we explain in Chapter 8, you need to convert bitmap 
files to grayscale or color if you want to merge the images with an RGB image. 
If you convert to grayscale, Elements takes care of converting grayscale to 
RGB mode.
As an example of an effect resulting 
from combining grayscale and color 
images, look over Figure 3-5. The 
original RGB image was converted to 
a bitmap and then saved as a differ-
ent file. The bitmap was converted 
to grayscale and dropped on top of 
the RGB image. After adjusting the 
opacity, the result is a grainy effect 
with desaturated color.
You can acquire Bitmap mode images 
directly in Elements when you scan 
images that are black and white. 
Illustrated art, logos, your signature, 
or a copy of a fax might be the kind 
of files you scan directly in Bitmap 
mode. Additionally, you can convert 
your images to Bitmap mode.
Converting RGB color to bitmap is a 
two-step process. You need to first 
convert to grayscale and then convert 
from grayscale to bitmap. If you select 
the Bitmap menu command while in 
RGB color, Elements prompts you to 
convert to grayscale first.
Figure 3-5: You can create some interesting 
effects by combining the same image from a 
bitmap file and an RGB file.

52
Par t I: Get ting Started 
To convert RGB mode to Bitmap mode, do the following:
 
1. Open an image that you want to convert to Bitmap mode in either Full 
Edit or Quick Edit mode.
 
2. Choose Image➪Mode➪Bitmap.
 
 If you start in RGB mode, Elements prompts you to convert to grayscale.
 
3. Click OK, and the Bitmap dialog box opens.
 
 The Bitmap dialog box provides options for selecting the output resolu-
tion and a conversion method.
 
4. Select a resolution.
 
 By default, the Bitmap dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-6, displays the 
current resolution. You can edit the text box and type a new resolution 
value or accept the default.
 
5. From the Use drop-down menu, 
select from these 
settings:
 
• 50% Threshold
 
• Pattern Dither
 
• Diffusion Dither
 
 Look over Figure 3-7 to see a 
comparison of the different 
methods used in converting 
RGB images to bitmaps.
 
6. Click OK to convert your image 
to Bitmap mode.
Converting to Grayscale mode
Grayscale images have black and white pixels and any one of 256 levels of 
gray. By converting an RGB image to grayscale, you can make it look like a 
black-and-white photo.
 
You can convert an image to grayscale in one of three ways, but remember 
that one of these methods isn’t as good as the others. We recommend that 
you avoid converting to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪Grayscale. 
When Elements performs this conversion, it removes all the color from the 
pixels, so you lose some precious data during the conversion and can’t 
regain the color after conversion. If you convert an image to grayscale, save 
the file, and delete the original from your hard drive or memory card, the 
color image is lost forever. You can save a secondary file, but this method 
can add a little confusion and require some more space on your hard drive.
Figure 3-6: Type a resolution for your output 
and select the conversion method from the Use 
drop-down menu.

As an alternative to using the menu command for converting images to gray-
scale, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an RGB image in Elements.
 
2. Duplicate a layer.
 
 The default Panels Bin contains the Layers panel. In this panel, you find 
a pop-up menu when you click More in the upper-right corner. From the 
menu commands, choose Duplicate Layer. (For more information on 
working with layers, see Chapter 8.)
 
3. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation (or press Ctrl/
Ô+U ) to open the Hue/Saturation dialog box, shown in Figure 3-8.

54
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
4. Drag the Saturation slider to 
the far left to desaturate the 
image.
 
 All color disappears, but the 
brightness values of all the 
pixels remain unaffected. (For 
more information on using the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box and 
the other Adjust Color com-
mands, see Chapter 10.)
 
5. Turn off the color layer by 
clicking the eye icon.
 
 In the Layers panel, you see two 
layers, as shown in Figure 3-9. 
You don’t need to turn off the 
color layer to print the file in 
grayscale, but turning it off can 
help you remember which color 
layer you used the last time you printed or exported the file.
Following the preceding steps pro-
vides you with a file that contains 
both RGB and grayscale. If you want 
to print the color layer, you can turn 
off the grayscale layer. If you need to 
exchange files with graphic design-
ers, you can send the layered file, and 
then the design professional can use 
both the color image and the gray-
scale image.
The other advantage of converting 
RGB color to grayscale by using the 
Hue/Saturation dialog box is that 
you don’t disturb any changes in 
the brightness values of the pixels. 
Moving the Saturation slider to 
desaturate the image affects only the 
color. The luminance and lightness 
values remain the same.
A menu command was introduced 
in Photoshop Elements 5 for con-
verting color images to grayscale. 
Figure 3-8: Open the Hue/Saturation dialog box 
and move the Saturation slider to the far left to 
eliminate color.
Figure 3-9: The Layers panel shows the 
grayscale and color layers. You can turn 
layers on or off by clicking the eye icon.

55
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Choose Enhance➪Convert to Black and White in either Edit mode or Quick 
Edit mode, and you see the Convert to Black and White dialog box, as shown 
in Figure 3-10.
This dialog box contains many controls for adjusting brightness and contrast 
in images that you convert to grayscale. You can select from some preset 
options in the Select a Style list. You move the sliders in the Adjustment 
Intensity area and view a dynamic preview in the After thumbnail area.
 
If you want to keep your original RGB image in the same file as the grayscale 
version, duplicate the background by choosing Duplicate Layer from the Layers 
panel’s More menu. Click the background and choose Enhance➪Convert to 
Black and White. The conversion is applied only to the background, leaving the 
Background copy layer in your original color mode.
Converting to Indexed Color mode
Indexed color is a mode you use occasionally with Web graphics, such as 
saving in GIF format or PNG-8. When saving indexed color images, you can, at 
times, create smaller file sizes than RGB that are ideal for using in Web site 
designs.
 
 
Figure 3-10: The Convert to Black and White dialog box.

56
Par t I: Get ting Started 
RGB images in 24-bit color (8 bits per channel) are capable of rendering 
colors from a palette of 16.7 million colors, as we explain in Chapter 2. An 
indexed color image is an 8-bit image with only a single channel. The total 
number of colors you get with indexed color can be no more than 256. When 
you convert RGB images to indexed color, you can choose to dither the color, 
which displays the image with a dithered effect much like you see with bit-
mapped images. This dithering effect makes the file appear as though it has 
more than 256 colors, and the transition between colors appears smoother 
than if no dithering was applied.
On occasion, indexed color images have an advantage over RGB images when 
hosting the images on Web servers: The fewer colors in a file, the smaller the 
file size. When you prepare images for Web hosting, you can choose to use 
indexed color or RGB color. Whether you choose one over the other really 
depends on how well the image appears on your monitor. If you have some 
photos that you want to show on Web pages, you should use RGB images and 
save them in a format appropriate for Web hosting, as we explain in the sec-
tion “Saving files for the Web,” later in this chapter.
If you have files composed of artwork, such as logos, illustrations, and draw-
ings, you may find that the appearance of index colors is no different from 
the same images as RGB. If that’s the case, you can keep the index color 
image and use it for your Web pages.
To convert RGB images to indexed color, choose Image➪Mode➪Indexed 
Color; the Indexed Color dialog box opens. A number of different options are 
available to you, and fortunately, you can preview the results while you make 
choices. Get in and poke around, and you can see the options applied in the 
image window.
Saving Files with Purpose
Photoshop Elements files can be saved in a variety of different formats. Some 
format types require you to convert a color mode before the format can be 
used. Therefore, a relationship exists between file formats and saving files. 
Additionally, bit depths in images also relate to the kinds of file formats you 
can use when saving files.
Before you go too far in Elements, become familiar with file formats and the 
conversions that you need to make to save in one format or another. If you 
do nothing to an image in terms of converting modes or changing bit depth, 
you can save a file after editing in the same format in which the file was 
opened. In many circumstances, you open an image and prepare it for some 
form of output, which requires more thought about the kind of file format 
you use when saving the file.

57
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Using the Save/Save As dialog box
In most any program, the Save (or Save As) dialog box is a familiar place 
where you make some choices about the file to be saved. With Save As, you 
can save a duplicate copy of your image or a modified copy and retain the 
original file.
To use the Save (or Save As) dialog box, choose File➪Save for files to be 
saved the first time, or choose File➪Save As for any file, and a dialog box 
then opens.
The standard navigational tools you find in any Save dialog box appear in the 
Elements Save/Save As dialog box. Here are some standard options you find 
in the Elements Save/Save As dialog box:
 
✓ Filename: This item is common to all Save dialog boxes. Type a name 
for your file in the text box.
 
✓ Format: From the drop-down menu, you select file formats. We explain 
the formats supported by Elements in the section “Understanding file 
formats,” later in this chapter.
A few options make the Photoshop Elements Save/Save As dialog box differ-
ent from other Save dialog boxes that you might be accustomed to using. The 
Save Options area in the Save As dialog box provides these choices:
 
✓ Include in the Organizer: If you want the file added to the Organizer, 
select this check box. (For more information about using the Organizer, 
see Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Save in Version Set with Original: You can edit images and save a ver-
sion of your image, but only in Quick Edit mode. When you save the file 
from Quick Edit mode, this check box is active. Select the box to save a 
version of the original, which appears in the Organizer.
 
✓ Color: Check the box for ICC (International Color Consortium) Profile. 
Depending on which profile you’re using, the option appears for sRGB or 
Adobe RGB (1998). When the check box is selected, the profile is embed-
ded in the image. See Chapter 2 for more information on profiles.
 
✓ Thumbnail: If you save a file with a thumbnail, you can see a miniature 
representation of your image when viewing it in folders or on the desk-
top. If you select Ask When Saving in the Saving Files preferences, the 
check box can be enabled or disabled. If you select an option for Never 
Save or Always Save in the Preferences dialog box, this box is enabled or 
disabled (and grayed out) for you. You need to return to the Preferences 
dialog box if you want to change the option.
 
✓ Use Lower Case Extension: File extensions give you a clue to which file 
format was used when a file was saved. Elements automatically adds the 
extension to the filename for you. Your choices are to use uppercase or 

58
Par t I: Get ting Started 
lowercase letters for the extension name. Select the check box for Use 
Lower Case Extension for lowercase or deselect the check box if you 
want to use uppercase characters in the filename.
Saving files for the Web
You save files for Web hosting in a different dialog box than when you’re 
saving files for other output. Choose File➪Save for Web, and the Save for 
Web dialog box opens. We explain all you need to know about how to use the 
Save for Web dialog box for saving Web images in Chapter 15.
Understanding file formats
When you save files from Elements, you need to pick a file format in the 
Format drop-down menu found in both the Save and Save As dialog boxes.
 
When you choose from the different format options, keep the following 
information in mind:
 
✓ File formats are especially important when you exchange files with other 
users. Each format has a purpose, and other programs can accept or 
reject files depending on the format you choose.
 
✓ Whether you can select one format or another when you save a file depends 
on the color mode, the bit depth, and whether layers are present. If a 
format isn’t present in the Format drop-down menu when you attempt to 
save a file, return to one of the 
edit modes and perform some 
kind of edit, such as changing a 
color mode or flattening layers, 
in order to save the file in your 
chosen format.
For a glimpse at all the file formats 
available to you, open a standard 
RGB color image in Standard Edit 
mode, choose File➪Save As, and 
click the down arrow to open the 
Format drop-down menu. As you 
can see in Figure 3-11, you have 
many format options.
In the following sections, we explain 
most of the file formats supported 
by Elements and the purpose for 
each format.
Figure 3-11: Open the Format drop-down 
menu in either the Save or Save As dialog box 
to make the formats supported by Elements 
appear.

59
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Photoshop (*.PSD, *.PDD)
This format is the native file format for both Photoshop and Photoshop 
Elements. The format supports saving all color modes and bit depths, and 
you can preserve layers. Use this format when you want to save in a native 
format or exchange files with Photoshop users. Also use it for saving files 
that you need to return to for more editing. When you save layers, any text 
you add to layers can be edited when you return to the file. (See Chapter 13 
for more information on adding text to an image.)
BMP (*.BMP, *.RLE, *.DIB)
The term bitmap can be a little confusing. You have both a file format type 
that’s bitmap and a color mode that’s also bitmap. Don’t confuse the two. 
The bitmap format supports saving in all color modes and in all bit depths. 
The Bitmap color mode, which we cover in the section “Converting to Bitmap 
mode,” earlier in this chapter, is 1-bit black-and-white only.
Use the bitmap format when you want to add images to system resources, 
such as wallpaper for your desktop. Bitmap is also used with many different 
application programs. If you can’t import images in other program docu-
ments, try to save them as BMP files.
CompuServe GIF (*.GIF)
Barb was a college coed, and Ted had a mustache and wore a green leisure 
suit, when CompuServe was the host for our e-mail accounts. We exchanged 
files and mail on 300 baud modems. Later, in 1987, CompuServe developed 
GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) to exchange files between mainframe 
computers and the ever-growing number of users working on Osborne, 
Kaypro, Apple, and Radio Shack TRS-80 computers.
GIF is now a popular format for hosting Web graphics. GIF images can be 
indexed color or animated images, and they support the smallest file sizes. 
Use this format when you need fewer than 256 colors and want to create ani-
mation in your images.
Photo Project Format (*.PSE)
Use this option when you create a project and want to save the file as a proj-
ect. See Chapter 16 for more on creating projects in Elements.
Photoshop EPS (*.EPS)
Photoshop EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) files are sometimes used by 
graphic artists when they’re designing jobs for commercial printing. The 
more popular format for creative professionals is TIFF, but Photoshop EPS 
has some advantages not found in other formats.

60
Par t I: Get ting Started 
Depending on the color mode of your 
image, you have different options 
when you’re using the Photoshop 
EPS file format. Select the format in 
the Save/Save As dialog box and click 
Save. If you’re working on a bitmap 
image (1 bit), the EPS Options dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 3-12, opens. 
It offers an option to save transpar-
ency wherever white appears in your 
document.
Notice the Transparent Whites check 
box. You might have a circular logo for which you want the area around the 
circle to appear transparent. If you import the graphical image in another 
program, you can see the black in the image, and all the white area is trans-
parent and shows any background through what was white in the original 
bitmap image. If you save a file in a higher bit depth, the EPS Options dialog 
box doesn’t provide an option for making whites transparent.
JPEG (*.JPG, *.JPEG, *.JPE)
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is perhaps the most common file 
format now in use. JPEG files are used with e-mail attachments and by many 
photo labs for printing files, and they can be viewed in JPEG viewers and 
directly in Web browsers. Just about every program capable of importing 
images supports the JPEG format. Creative professionals wouldn’t dream of 
using the JPEG format in design layouts, but everyone else uses the format 
for all kinds of documents.
You need to exercise some caution when you’re using the JPEG format. JPEG 
files are compressed to reduce file size. You can scrunch an image of several 
megabytes into a few hundred kilobytes. When you save a file with JPEG com-
pression, you experience data loss. You might not see this on your monitor, 
or it might appear noticeably on photo prints if you’re using low compression 
while preserving higher quality. However, when you save with maximum 
compression, more pixels are tossed away, and you definitely notice image 
degradation.
 
When you save, open, and resave images in JPEG format, each new save 
degrades an image more. If you need to submit JPEG images to photo labs for 
printing your pictures, keep saving in Photoshop PSD file format until you’re 
ready to save the final image. Save in JPEG format when you want to save the 
final file for printing and use a low compression with high quality.
When you select JPEG for the format and click Save, the JPEG Options dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 3-13. You choose the amount of compression 
by typing a value in the Quality text box or by moving the slider below the 
Quality text box. The acceptable ranges are from 0 to 12 — 0 is the lowest 
Figure 3-12: When you’re working on 1-bit 
bitmap images, this dialog box offers an option 
to save transparency where white appears in 
the document.

61
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
quality and results in the highest 
compression, and 12 is the highest 
quality that results in the lowest 
amount of compression.
Notice that you also have choices 
in the Format Options of the JPEG 
Options dialog box. The Progressive 
option creates a progressive JPEG 
file commonly used with Web brows-
ers. This file type shows progressive 
quality while the file downloads from a 
Web site. The image first appears in a 
low-quality view and shows higher-
resolution views until the image 
appears at full resolution when it’s 
completely downloaded in your 
browser window.
JPEG 2000 (*.JPF, *.JPX, *.JP2, *. J2K, *.JPC)
JPEG 2000 is a newer JPEG file format. This format offers you the same mode 
quality as the JPEG format and an option to save the file with compression 
without tossing away pixels, in which case, you get lossless compression. The 
JPEG 2000 dialog box shows you, right in the dialog box and before you save 
the image, the results of the choices you make in terms of the resulting file size.
 
If you need to save images in JPEG format for your commercial photo lab, 
check with the technicians and ask whether they support JPEG 2000. If so, 
save your files in this format with a lossless compression. When files are 
compressed with lossless compression, you can expect to lose about two-
thirds of the original file size. For example, a 6MB file can be reduced to 
about 2MB when it’s saved as JPEG 2000 in a lossless-compression format. 
Note that if you save files in JPEG 2000 format for the Web, Web browsers 
need to have a plug-in to see the images.
PCX (*.PCX)
PCX is a native PC format first used with PC Paintbrush. Most programs 
now support newer file formats, and you’re not likely to need to save in PCX 
format. If you have legacy files from years ago, you can open PCX files in 
Elements, edit them, and save them in a newer format.
Photoshop PDF (*.PDF, *.PDP)
Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) is designed to maintain document 
integrity and exchange files between computers. PDF is one of the most popu-
lar formats and can be viewed in the free Adobe Reader program available 
Figure 3-13: When saving in JPEG format, 
choose the amount of compression you want 
to apply to the saved image.

62
Par t I: Get ting Started 
for installation on your Elements CD installer or by downloading it from the 
Adobe Web site.
PDF is all over the place in Elements. When you jump into Organize mode and 
create slide presentations, cards, and calendars, for example, you can export 
your documents as PDF files. When you save in Photoshop PDF format, you 
can preserve layers and text. Text is recognizable in Adobe Reader (or other 
Acrobat viewers) and can be searched by using the Reader’s Find and Search 
tools.
PDF files can be printed, hosted on Web sites, and exchanged with users of 
Windows, Macintosh, Unix, and Linux. All in all, this format is well suited for 
all the files you create in Elements that contain text, layers, and transpar-
ency, and for when you want to exchange files with users who don’t have 
Elements or Photoshop.
Photoshop Raw (*.RAW)
This format is used to exchange files between Windows and Mac users and 
mainframe computers. Unless you prepare files to be viewed on mainframes, 
don’t bother saving in this format.
PICT File (*.PCT, *.PICT)
PICT (Picture) format is Apple’s answer to PCX on Windows. This format 
originated with the 1984 introduction of the Macintosh and the MacDraw 
program. PICT files are helpful for creating slides and video files on the 
Macintosh and for printing your images on film recorders that don’t use 
PostScript. You might use the format when requested by a Mac user or 
when sending files that need to be printed as slides on a non-PostScript film 
recorder.
Pixar (*.PXR)
This format is used for exchanging files with Pixar workstations.
PNG (*.PNG)
PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is another format used with Web pages. 
PNG supports all color modes, 24-bit images, and transparency. Some older 
browsers, however, may need a plug-in to see PNG files on Web pages. One 
disadvantage of using PNG is that color profiles can’t be embedded in the 
images, like they can with JPEG.
Scitex CT (*.SCT)
The Scitex Continuous Tone (CT) format is used by Scitex workstations in 
commercial printing environments.

63
 Chapter 3: Working with Resolutions, Color Modes, and File Formats
Targa (*.TGA, *.VDA, *.ICB, *.VST)
Targa is a format for describing bitmap images and is capable of represent-
ing bitmaps from black and white, indexed color, and RGB color. It’s used for 
applications that can read Targa files, such as Truevision’s hardware.
TIFF (*.TIF, *.TIFF)
TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) is the most common format used by graphic 
designers. TIFF is generally used for importing images in professional layout 
programs, such as Adobe InDesign and Adobe PageMaker, and when com-
mercial photo labs and print shops use equipment that supports download-
ing TIFF files directly to their devices. (Note: Direct downloads are used in 
lieu of opening a Print dialog box.)
Inasmuch as creative professionals have used TIFF for so long, a better 
choice for designers using a program such as Adobe InDesign is saving in the 
native Photoshop PSD file format. This requires a creative professional to 
save only one file in native format without bothering to save both native and 
TIFF formats.
TIFF, along with Photoshop PSD and Photoshop PDF, supports saving layered 
files and works in all color modes. When you save in TIFF format, you can 
also compress files in several 
different compression schemes, and 
compression with TIFF files doesn’t 
lose data unless you choose a JPEG 
compression.
When you select TIFF for the format 
and click Save in the Save/Save As 
dialog box, the TIFF Options dialog 
box opens, as shown in Figure 3-14.
In the Image Compression area, you 
have these choices:
 
✓ NONE: Selecting this option 
results in no compression. You 
use this option when sending 
files to creative professionals 
for creating layouts in programs 
such as Adobe InDesign. None 
of the compression schemes in 
the following bullets is recom-
mended for printing files to 
commercial printing devices.
Figure 3-14: Choose TIFF from the Format drop-
down menu and click Save to open the TIFF 
Options dialog box.

64
Par t I: Get ting Started 
 
✓ LZW: This lossless compression scheme results in much lower file sizes 
without destroying data.
 
✓ ZIP: ZIP is also a lossless compression scheme. You can favor ZIP com-
pression over LZW when you have large areas of the same color in an 
image.
 
✓ JPEG: JPEG is lossy and results in the smallest file sizes. Use JPEG here 
the same as when you apply JPEG compression with files saved in the 
JPEG format.
File formats at a glance
We’ve been working with Photoshop, which saves in the same formats listed 
in this section, since 1989. Yet we have never used all the formats available in 
Photoshop Elements. At most, you’ll use maybe three or four of these formats.
 
You don’t need to remember all the formats and what they do. Just pick the 
ones you use in your workflow, mark Table 3-3 for reference, and refer to it 
from time to time until you have a complete understanding of how files need 
to be prepared in order to save them in your desired formats. If you happen 
to receive a file from another user in one of the formats you don’t use, come 
back to the description in this chapter when you need some detail on what 
the format is used for.

The letter H in Column 4 represents higher-bit modes, such as 16- and 32-bit images, which you might 
acquire from scanners and digital cameras. See Chapter 2 for more information on higher-bit images.
*Embedding profiles is limited to embedding either sRGB IEC61966-2.1 or AdobeRGB (1998).
**CompuServe GIF doesn’t support saving layers, although it supports saving layers as frames. You 
use the frames when creating an animated GIF file used for Web pages.

Audio and video formats supported in Elements
In addition to the image formats listed in Table 3-3, Elements supports audio 
and video files. The support is limited to adding and viewing audio and video 
files in the Organizer and printing the first frame in a video file. Other kinds 
of edits made to audio and video files require special software for audio and 
video editing.
Audio files can be imported in slide shows, as we explain in Chapter 15. The 
acceptable file formats for audio files are MP3, WAV, QuickTime, and WMA. 
If you have audio files in another format, you need to convert the file format. 
For these kinds of conversions, you can search the Internet for a shareware 
audio-conversion program.
Video files can also be imported in slide shows, as we discuss in Chapter 15. 
Elements supports the WMV (Windows) video format. Like with audio files, 
if videos are saved in other formats, such as Apple QuickTime (for Windows 
users), you need to convert the QT video format to WMV. For video-conversion 
utilities, you can also find shareware programs to do the job. Search the 
Internet for a video converter.

Part II
Getting Organized

In this part . . .
T
he ﬁ rst thing you want to do after opening the 
Photoshop Elements program is to access 
your photos from a digital camera, from your hard 
drive, or from your scanner. In this part, we talk 
about how to access your pictures and get them 
into Elements for editing. We talk about organizing 
your pictures by using many impressive organiz-
ing features in the program, as well as by search-
ing for photos, labeling them, and then creating 
different versions of the same picture. When it 
comes to organizing pictures, Elements is one of 
the best tools you can ﬁ nd to keep your precious 
photos neatly cataloged and accessible.

Getting Your Images
In This Chapter
▶ Acquiring photos from cameras and card readers
▶ Scanning photos and artwork
▶ Importing photos from CDs, DVDs, and other media
▶ Working with online services
▶ Acquiring photos from cell phones
▶ Creating new documents
▶ Working with Camera Raw files
You have many different sources to work with for getting a picture into 
Elements, where you can play with it, experiment on it, and edit it. If you 
have a digital camera, you’re in the right place; we walk you through 
all kinds of different options for getting the shots you took with 
your camera into Elements.
If you have a digital scanner, you’re in the right place, 
too! We talk about scanning photos, as well. If you 
have some CDs, sources of files on the Internet, 
some massive collection of images written to a 
DVD, or even a picture or two that you took with 
your cell phone, you’re still in the right place!
In the preceding chapters, we flirt with opening files. 
If you followed some of the steps in those chapters 
for opening images, you should have a feel for using 
the Open tool and Open command. But there’s more to 
acquiring images than just using the Open command, as 
you can find out in this chapter.
This chapter covers all you need to know about getting images into 
Elements from all kinds of sources and answers all your questions about how 
to move around the workspaces to get your files into Elements.

Par t II: Getting Organized 
Digital Cameras versus Scanners 
and Film Cameras
If you don’t have a digital camera, we encourage you to buy one as soon 
as you can. Digital cameras and Photoshop Elements were made to work 
together. If you’ve spent any time scanning images on a digital scanner, you’ll 
appreciate the speed that a camera offers you compared to a scanner when 
the time comes to get your images into Elements.
“But I can do more with my scanner than with a digital camera,” you say? 
“Not really,” we say. Just for starters, here are some of the benefits you get 
with a digital camera:
 
✓ Faster access to files: Copying images from a digital camera media card 
is much faster than scanning images from prints and film.
 
✓ Higher-quality images: Considering the costs of medium- to high-end 
scanners, you can shoot much better pictures with a good-quality SLR 
(single lens reflex) camera with a quality lens than you can scan film or 
prints with a good-quality consumer-grade scanner.
 
✓ OCR and text recognition: Unless you have industrial-strength needs 
for scanning reams of text documents that need to be interpreted by 
optical character recognition (OCR) software, which converts images to 
editable text, you’ll do just fine with a digital camera and copy stand. If 
you scan individual pages on a scanner, shooting pages with a camera 
is much faster and can produce the same results when pages need to be 
converted to text.
 
✓ 3-D objects: With digital cameras, you can shoot 3-D objects. Try scanning 
a pair of shoes — well, maybe some other three-dimensional object — on 
a scanner bed sometime. The experiment isn’t worth getting dirt all over 
your scanner.
 
✓ Reduced costs: With a digital camera, you eliminate film and film-
processing costs. You can order photo prints in superstore outlets, at 
less than ten cents apiece, that are printed on the same photo paper you 
get with prints from film. What’s more, you can order prints of only the 
pictures you want to keep, rather than develop an entire roll to have just 
that one good photograph.
 
✓ Organizing and archiving: Digital images can be saved to CDs/DVDs, 
where you can add information for every image to keep them easily 
organized, as we explain in Chapter 6. Searching a DVD is much faster 
than searching through photo books of slides, film, or prints. Archiving 
digital images is fast and easy, and you don’t need to worry about 
scratches, faded colors, or damaged originals.

71
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
✓ Control over image processing: With film, you’re stuck with the pro-
cessing time and temperature that the photo lab uses to process your 
film. With some digital cameras, you can post-process an image after 
you shoot it, as we explain in the last section of this chapter.
 
✓ Video clips: Many digital cameras provide a video-shooting mode so 
that you can shoot video.
The preceding list gives you some of the benefits of using a digital camera 
over using a scanner. Scanners do have their place, and some of the benefits 
you have with a scanner that you don’t have with cameras involve
 
✓ Auto document feeders: You can buy scanners that have automatic doc-
ument feeders, where pages of documents can be scanned unattended. 
If you need to scan large volumes of pages to recognize text, this opera-
tion is much more practical than using a camera.
 
✓ Legacy pictures: You can shoot photo prints with digital cameras and, 
depending on the camera, produce images equal to a scanner. Filmstrips 
and slides are easily handled with scanners and adapters. However, 
you can also find attachments for your camera that enable you to shoot 
slides and negatives. For more information on shooting slides and 
negatives with a digital camera, check out Color Correction For Digital 
Photographers Only, by Ted Padova and Don Mason (Wiley).
Grabbing Images from Your Camera
Copying photos from your digital camera to your computer so that you can 
work with them in Elements is simple if you’re familiar with your camera and 
the tools at your disposal. In the following sections, you can find some points 
to consider about choosing a resolution when you shoot your pictures, 
as well as how to use the Microsoft AutoPlay Wizard (Windows Vista) and 
Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 – Photo Downloader after you hook up your 
camera to your computer.
Choosing a file format
When you work with digital photos in Elements, the file format of your images 
is an important point to consider. You choose this format before you take 
your pictures, and the format is carried over to your computer when you pull 
images off your camera.
The most common file formats that digital cameras offer are JPEG and 
Camera Raw. Some cameras offer other options, but these two formats are 
the most common. Low-cost point-and-shoot cameras offer you only the JPEG 
format, and the more expensive cameras, including the SLR types, offer you 
both JPEG and Camera Raw:

72
Par t II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ JPEG: Cameras that produce JPEG images process images with JPEG 
compression before saving them. It’s as though your camera performs a 
darkroom method of film processing when the shot is taken.
 
 We describe the JPEG file format in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Camera Raw: This format provides you with an optimum image for edit-
ing in Elements. When a Camera Raw image is saved to a media source, 
all the information the sensor captured is saved with the file. These 
images are post-processed when you open them. (See the “A Basic 
Primer on Camera Raw” section, later in this chapter, to find out about 
opening Camera Raw images.) For example, you can open a Camera Raw 
image and, before the image opens in Elements, adjust temperature, 
exposure, and a bunch of other settings. You can return to the original 
Camera Raw file and change the temperature or exposure, for example, 
to open the file with different settings. Just like chemical temperature 
and development time affect analog film processing, similar options 
affect post-processing Camera Raw images. The difference between 
analog film and Camera Raw is that after your analog film is processed, 
you can’t change the processing attributes. With Camera Raw, you can 
go back and post-process the image 100 times and change the process-
ing attributes each time.
 
 Camera Raw also supports higher-bit-depth images than JPEG files do.
 
If you have a choice between just JPEG and both JPEG and Camera Raw, 
always choose the latter. You have much more editing control over your 
images, and ultimately, you get better results.
Using the AutoPlay Wizard
Microsoft AutoPlay Wizard may launch automatically when your computer 
is connected to a media source. You can use the wizard to download images 
from your media source to your computer.
To copy images from a media source or when your camera is connected to 
your computer, follow these steps:
 
1. Hook up the media to your computer.
 
 Connect your camera or external media reader to your computer, or 
insert a media source into a port or drive on your computer. The methods 
available to you should be detailed in the user’s guide that shipped with 
your camera.
 
 When you connect your media to your computer, a dialog box opens, 
providing options for how to handle the media.
 
2. Under General Options, click Open Folder to View Files Using 
Windows Explorer, as shown in Figure 4-1.

73
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
3. Open the folder containing 
images on the media card.
 
 You might find a folder listed 
as DCIM or another name when 
you open the media card in 
Windows Explorer. Double-click 
the folder name to open the 
folder.
 
4. Select folders in Windows 
Explorer and drag them to a 
folder on your hard drive to 
copy them to your computer.
 
 The images are copied to the 
target folder.
 
You can set preferences for the 
AutoPlay by clicking the Set AutoPlay 
Defaults in Control Panel link in the 
AutoPlay dialog box. When you open 
the Control Panel preferences, you can 
choose from a number of options for 
handling media, as shown in Figure 4-2. 
If you want to prevent the AutoPlay 
Wizard from automatically opening, 
you can select Take No Actions from 
the media types’ drop-down menus.
 
Figure 4-2: Choose from a number of options for handling media.

Par t II: Getting Organized 
Using Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 – 
Photo Downloader
The Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 – Photo Downloader is installed with 
your Elements program. Photo Downloader acquires images from digital cam-
eras connected to your computer, from card readers, and from card reader 
ports on your computer. Photo Downloader is an alternative application to 
Microsoft AutoPlay.
To use the Adobe Photoshop 7.0 – Photo Downloader, follow these steps:
 
1. Hook up the media to your 
computer.
 
2. Click Cancel in the Microsoft 
AutoPlay Wizard.
 
 Because the wizard auto-
launches, the opening pane 
appears when you make a con-
nection between your camera 
media source and your com-
puter. To bail out of the wizard, 
click Cancel.
 
3. If you don’t see the download 
launch automatically, choose 
Start➪All Programs➪Adobe➪
Adobe Download Manager➪
Adobe Download Manager. 
Alternately, you can click the 
Adobe Download Manager in 
the Windows status bar.
 
 You can also launch Elements and choose File➪Get Photos and 
Videos➪From Camera or Card Reader, or press Ctrl/Ô+G.
 
4. In the Photo Downloader, shown in Figure 4-3, click Get Photos to 
copy all the files to your hard drive.
 
5. If you want to copy a select group of files to your hard drive, click the 
Advanced Dialog button in the Photo Downloader Standard dialog box.
 
 The Advanced dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-4.
 
6. Remove check marks from all photos you don’t want to copy to your 
hard drive. 
 
 By default, all photos are checked in a box below the photo thumbnails.
Figure 4-3: The Photo Downloader enables you 
to copy files from a media card to your hard 
drive.

75
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
 
 Figure 4-4: Click Advanced Dialog to open the advanced dialog box, where you can selectively 
copy photos to your hard drive.
 
7. Click Get Photos to copy the selected photos to your hard drive.
 
 Immediately after you make your selection, the Organizer window 
opens (if you checked the box for Open Organizer When Finished in the 
Standard dialog box). All the photos downloaded to your hard drive 
appear in a new Organizer window.
 
To simplify the process, stick with using one tool to acquire your digi-
tal camera images — either the Microsoft AutoPlay or the Adobe Photo 
Download Manager.
Resizing images from digital cameras
Depending on your camera and the camera settings you use, you may need to 
resize your images after you download them.

76
Par t II: Getting Organized 
Camera image resolution, which is measured in megapixels (millions of pixels), 
is a factor in image size at a 6:4 or 4:3 image ration. If you have a 6-megapixel 
camera, the full-resolution images from your camera are about 3000 x 2000 
pixels — 6:4 ratio. The file size for a 6-megapixel image is about 5.7MB.
On the screen, the resolution of all digital camera images is 72 ppi (pixels per 
inch). Using the 6-megapixel image as an example, the resolution at 72 ppi 
produces an image a little more than 41 x 27 inches. Regardless of whether 
your camera takes pictures at 3, 5, or 8 megapixels, the images may all be 
captured at 72 ppi, but the dimensions vary according to the total number of 
pixels captured. With other cameras, you might find different resolutions and 
sizes, especially when capturing images as RAW.
When you visit the Image Size dialog box, deselect Resample Image, and edit 
the resolution text box when you’re preparing images for print. (See Chapter 
3 for more information on using the Image Size dialog box.) If your color 
printer requires 150 ppi, changing a 6-megapixel image from 72 ppi at 41 x 27 
inches produces an image of a little more than 20 x 13 inches.
Using a Scanner
Scanners connect through the same ports as cameras and card readers. 
Unless you have a SCSI (Small Computer Systems Interface) device, which is 
another type of connection port but almost nonexistent today, you use either 
USB or FireWire. Most low-end scanners sold now are USB devices.
Even the lowest-end scanners provide 16-bit scans that help you get a little 
more data in the shadows and highlights. Like with a digital camera, a scan-
ner’s price is normally in proportion with its quality.
Preparing before you scan
Just as you’d clean a lens on a digital camera and set various menu selections 
before clicking the shutter button, you should prepare a few things ahead of 
time before scanning:
 
✓ Connect the scanner properly. Make sure that you have all connections 
made to your computer according to the user manual that came with 
your scanner. If you just purchased a scanner, check for any lock bolts 
and remove them according to the instructions.
 
✓ Clean the scanner platen. Use a lint-free cloth and some glass cleaner 
(applied to the cloth) to remove all dust and particles on the glass. The 
more dust particles you remove, the easier the job of editing your image 
in Elements.

77
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
✓ Clean the source material. Be certain that the print or film you want to 
scan is free of dust and spots.
 
 If you have old negatives that are dirty or that have water spots or 
debris that you can’t remove with a cloth and film cleaner, soak the film 
in photo flo (a liquid you can purchase at a photo reseller). Be certain 
that your hands are clean and then run the filmstrip between two fin-
gers to remove the excess liquid. Turn on your shower full force with 
hot water only and hang film nearby to dry it. Remove the film when it’s 
dry, and you should see a surprisingly clean filmstrip compared to your 
soiled original.
 
✓ Get to know your scanner software. When you scan in Elements, the 
software supplied with your scanner takes charge, and you use the 
options in this software before it finally drops into an Elements Image 
window.
 
✓ Prepare the artwork. If you plan on scanning pages in a book or pam-
phlet, remove the pages or try to make photocopies so that the piece 
you scan lies flat on the scanner platen. Make sure that you observe 
copyright laws if you’re scanning printed works. For faxes and photo-
copies, try to improve originals by recopying them on a photocopier by 
using darker settings.
 
✓ Find the scanner’s sweet spot. Every scanner has an area where you can 
acquire the best scans. This area is often called the sweet spot. To find 
the scanner’s sweet spot, scan a blank piece of paper. The sweet spot is 
the brightest area on the resultant scan. Other areas should be darker. 
The sweet spot is most often in the upper-left quadrant, the lower-right 
quadrant, or the middle of the page. Note the area and plan to place 
your source material within this area when scanning pictures.
Understanding image requirements
All scanning software provides you with options for determining resolution 
and color mode before you start a new scan. You should decide what output 
you intend to use and scan originals at target resolutions designed to accom-
modate a given output. Some considerations include
 
✓ Scan the artwork or photo at the size and resolution for the final 
output. If you have a 3-x-5 photo that needs to be 1.5 x 2.5 inches on a 
Web page, scan the original with a 50-percent reduction in size at 72 ppi. 
(See Chapter 3 for information about resizing images.)
 
✓ Size images with the scanner software. If you have a 4-x-6 photo that 
needs to be output for prepress and commercial printing at 8 x 12 
inches, scan the photo at 4 x 6 inches at 600 ppi (enough to size to 200 
percent for a 300 dpi image).

78
Par t II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ Scan properly for line art. Line art is 1-bit black and white only. When 
you print line art on laser printers or prepare files for commercial printing, 
the line art resolution should match the device resolution. For example, 
printing to a 600 dpi (dots per inch) laser printer requires 600 ppi for a 1-bit 
line-art image. When you’re printing to an image setter at a print shop, or 
it’s going directly to plate or press, the resolution should be 1200 dpi.
 
✓ Scan grayscale images in color. In some cases, it doesn’t matter, but 
with some images and scanners, you can get better results by scanning 
in RGB (red, green, and blue) color and converting to grayscale by using 
the Hue/Saturation dialog box or the Convert to Black and White dialog 
box, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Scan in high bit depths. If your scanner is capable of scanning in 16- or 
32-bit, by all means, scan at the higher bit depths to capture the most 
data. See Chapter 3 for more information about working with higher-bit 
images.
Using scanner plug-ins
Generally, when you install your scanner software, a standalone applica-
tion and a plug-in are installed to control the scanning process. Plug-ins 
are designed to work inside other software programs, such as Photoshop 
Elements. When you’re using the plug-in, you can stay right in Elements to 
do all your scanning. Here’s how it works:
 
1. After installing a new scanner and the accompanying software, launch 
Elements and then open the Organizer by clicking Organize in the 
Welcome screen.
 
2. From the Organizer, open the Preferences dialog box by pressing 
Ctrl/Ô+K.
 
3. Click Scanner in the left column and adjust the Scanner preferences, 
as we describe in Chapter 2.
When the Preferences dialog box sees your scanner, you know that the con-
nection is properly set up and you’re ready to scan. Here’s how to complete 
your scan:
 
1. To open the scanner software from within Elements, choose File➪Get 
Photos➪From Scanner.
 
 You must be in the Organizer window to access this menu command.
 
 Elements may churn a bit, but eventually your scanner software appears 
atop the Organizer window, as you can see in Figure 4-5. The window 
is the scanner software provided by your scanner manufacturer. (Your 

79
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
window looks different than Figure 4-5 unless you use the same scanner 
we use.) Regardless of which software you use, you should have similar 
options for creating a preview; selecting resolution, color mode, and 
image size; scaling; and other options.
 
 
Figure 4-5: When you scan from within Elements, your scanner 
 
software loads on top of the Elements workspace.
 
2. Adjust the options according to your output 
requirements and the recommendations 
made by your scanner manufacturer.
 
3. When everything is ready to go, click the 
Scan button.
 
 The final image drops into an Elements 
Image window.
Scanning many photos at a time
If you have several photos to scan, you can lay 
them out on the scanner platen and perform a 
single scan to acquire all images in one pass. 
Arrange the photos to scan on the glass and set 
up all the options in the scanner window for 
your intended output. When you scan multiple 
images, they form a single scan, as you can see 
in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6: You can scan 
multiple images with one pass.

80
Par t II: Getting Organized 
After you scan multiple images, Elements makes it easy for you to separate 
each image into its own Image window, where you can save the images as sepa-
rate files. Choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos to make Elements magically 
open each image in a separate window while your original scan remains intact. 
The images are neatly tucked away in the Photo Bin, where you can select 
them for editing, as shown in Figure 4-7.
 
 
Figure 4-7: After you choose Image➪Divide Scanned Photos, the scan is split into separate 
 
Image windows.
Getting Files from Storage Media
When you acquire images in Elements from media sources, such as CD-ROMs, 
DVDs, external hard drives, and your internal hard drive, the process is very 
similar to opening files from digital cameras, which we explain in the section 
“Grabbing Images from Your Camera,” earlier in this chapter. Insert a CD or 
DVD into the CD/DVD drive, and the Windows AutoPlay Wizard opens just like 
when you insert a media cartridge or connect a cable from your camera to 
your computer.
Likewise, you can also open these files in the Organizer. Just cancel out of the 
wizard and follow these steps:

81
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
1. Open the Organizer window from the Welcome screen or click Photo 
Browser from one of the editing modes.
 
2. When the Organizer window opens, choose File➪Get Photos➪From 
Files and Folders.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose File➪Open or press Ctrl/Ô+O. The Open 
dialog box opens.
 
3. Open the source drive from the listed drives.
 
 You see the photos stored on the media.
 
4. Select images and click Get Photos (from the Organizer) or Open 
(from one of the editing modes) to open the files in the Organizer or 
an editor.
 
 Now, you can edit the photos in Elements or save them to your hard drive.
Using Online Services
Online printing and sharing services require you to set up an account with 
a service. You can access services provided by Adobe, including the new 
Photoshop.com service, Kodak, and other sources by clicking the Share tab 
above the Panels Bin in the Organizer and clicking either Order Prints or 
Online Album. To use a service, you begin by setting up an account, as we 
explain in Chapter 2.
You can create digital photo albums from your images and share them with 
friends, family, and coworkers. To initiate a sharing service, you send an e-mail 
invitation to others. Each member of your sharing group needs to set up an 
account individually. After everyone has an account, you and your friends can 
then order prints that are mailed from the online service center. All the kinds 
of prints you might order from a local superstore or photo lab are available 
from online services, including specialty items, such as calendars.
After setting up an account and choosing a service, you handle sharing ser-
vices by using the Share panels, as we explain in Chapter 16.
Phoning In Your Images
If you’ve used a previous version of Elements, you may remember that those 
versions offered a menu command for acquiring images from cell phones. 
Elements 7 doesn’t provide this menu command. If you want to add images to 
the Organizer or open images in one of the editing modes, you need to copy 
files via a USB or Bluetooth connection.

82
Par t II: Getting Organized 
After copying files to your hard drive, in Elements, choose File➪Get Photos 
and Video➪From Files and Folders or press Ctrl/Ô+G. Locate the folder into 
which you copied the files and add them to your Organizer or open them in 
one of the editing modes.
Creating Images from Scratch
You may want to start from scratch by creating a new document in Elements. 
New, blank pages have a number of uses. You can mix and merge images in 
a new document, as we explain in Chapter 8; create a canvas where you can 
draw and paint, as we explain in Chapter 12; or use the New dialog box to get 
some feedback on file sizes, dimensions, and resolution.
You can create new, blank documents by using one of several options. On the 
Welcome screen, which appears when you first launch Elements, click Edit 
to launch the Full Edit mode. Choose File➪New Blank File to open the New 
dialog box, in which you choose the document size, resolution, and other 
attributes. Likewise, you can create new files while working in either Quick 
Edit mode or in the Organizer.
Follow these steps to create a new document while working in any editing mode:
 
1. Open Elements and select an editing mode.
 
 Click Edit in the Welcome screen.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Blank File in any workspace or press Ctrl/Ô+N.
 
 Either way, the New dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
3. Select the attributes for the new file.
 
 You have several options from which to choose:
 
• Name: Type a name for 
your file.
 
• Presets: From the drop-
down menu, you can 
select from a number of 
different sizes.
 
• Size: You can select a 
preset size from a long 
drop-down menu. This is 
optional because you can 
change the file attributes 
in the other text boxes and 
drop-down menus.
Figure 4-8: Regardless of the method used to 
create a new, blank document, the New dialog 
box opens.

83
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
• Dimensions (Width/Height): Values in the Width and Height text boxes 
are independent. Either box can be edited without affecting the other. 
Adjacent to the values in the Width and Height text boxes, you find 
drop-down menus that offer many different options for units of mea-
sure, such as the default units of pixels followed by inches, centime-
ters (cm), millimeters (mm), points, picas, and columns.
 
• Resolution: Resolution here is similar to editing the resolution 
value in the Image Size dialog box when the Resample check box 
is selected. The resolution is an independent value and isn’t linked 
to the dimensions. If you want to know how resolution changes 
dimensions without resampling, create a new, blank file at the 
known values and click OK. Then, choose Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size and change the values in the Image Size dialog box, which we 
discuss in Chapter 3.
 
• Color Mode: Your choices are Bitmap, Grayscale, and RGB. (See 
Chapter 3 for more information about color modes.)
 
• Background Contents: You have three choices: White, Background 
Color, and Transparent. The selection you make results in the color 
of the blank image. If you choose Background Color, the current 
background color assigned on the Tools panel is applied to the back-
ground. See Chapter 12 for information on changing background 
color. If you choose Transparent, the image is created as a layer, and 
the layer name changes to Layer 0, as we explain in Chapter 8.
 
• Image Size: This value dynamically changes when you change the 
Width, Height, and Resolution values. The reported value is how 
much file size is required to save the uncompressed file.
 
4. Click OK after setting the file attributes to create the new document.
In addition to creating new, blank files, the New dialog box can be a helpful 
source of information for all your work in Elements. Suppose that you want 
to know how many images you can copy to a 128MB USB storage device or 
how large your digital camera files will print with a 150 ppi resolution. All you 
have to do is press Ctrl/Ô+N to open the New dialog box, plug in the values, 
and read the Image Size number or examine the file dimensions. If your files 
will be converted to grayscale, choose Grayscale from the Color Mode drop-
down menu and check the Image Size number to see how much your file size 
is reduced. Because this number is dynamic, it changes with each change you 
make to the file attributes.
Another means for creating new documents was introduced in Photoshop 
Elements 5. Rather than create a new, blank file, you can add pages to an 
existing file in the form of a project. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image in Full Edit mode.
 
2. Open the Project Bin by dragging the separator bar up or clicking the 
Photo Bin icon in the lower-left corner of the Elements window.

84
Par t II: Getting Organized 
 
3. Right-click the photo thumbnail in 
the Project Bin.
 
 The context menu, as shown in Figure 
4-9, appears.
 
4. Choose either Add Blank Page (for 
adding a new, blank page) or Add 
Page Using Current Layout (to dupli-
cate the current photo as a new page).
 
5. Save the file by choosing File➪Save 
As and selecting Photoshop Multiple 
Project as your file format.
 
 Note that the default format in the 
Save As dialog box is Photo Project 
Format (*.PSE).
 
 All the pages you add to a project 
are saved as separate files in a folder 
created automatically by Elements. 
When you open any one of the 
images, it appears separately in the 
Project Bin. To open an image in the 
stack, click the image you want to 
open in the Project Bin. Clicking an 
image in the Project Bin opens that 
image in the Image Window.
 
 In Figure 4-10, you can see thumbnails of a project where the original RGB 
image appears on the left, followed by a grayscale image, a sepia-tone 
image, and a bitmap image — all contained in the same photo project.
 
 
Figure 4-10: Click one of the thumbnails in the Project Bin to 
 
open the respective photo in the Image window.
A Basic Primer on Camera Raw
We include the elaborate description of Camera Raw in the following 
sections, after sharing with you all the other options you have for getting 
images in Elements. We recognize that you may not have a digital camera 
Figure 4-9: Right-click and then choose 
an option for adding a page to the photo 
selected in the Project Bin.

 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
capable of capturing Camera Raw images, so this information may not be of 
much interest to you now.
If you don’t have a camera capable of capturing Camera Raw images, you might 
want to look over the following sections to understand how this file format can 
benefit you. If you purchase a camera equipped with Camera Raw support, 
you’ll have some understanding of the advantages of using this format.
Understanding Camera Raw
Camera Raw images enable you to post-process your pictures. When you take 
a picture with a digital camera in Camera Raw format, the camera’s sensor 
records as much information as it can. When you open a Camera Raw file in 
Elements, you decide what part of that data is opened as a new image.
Suppose that your camera is set for exposure in tungsten lighting, which is 
used with tungsten flash photography in a studio. If you take this camera out-
side in daylight and shoot an image, all your images appear with a blue cast 
because tungsten lighting requires a cooler temperature than daylight.
If you acquire images that are saved in JPEG format, you need to do a lot of 
color correction after the image opens in Elements. If you shoot the image in 
Camera Raw format, you just process the image with a warmer temperature 
(consistent with conditions when the shot was taken), and your color correc-
tion in Elements is a fraction of what it is to fix a JPEG image.
Post-processing Camera Raw images requires a plug-in that’s installed with 
Photoshop Elements. When you open a Camera Raw image, the Camera Raw 
plug-in takes over and provides you with a huge set of options for post-
processing the image before you open it in one of the Elements editors.
 
Each camera developer uses a different flavor of Camera Raw, and some 
developers use different Raw formats between different models in their 
product line. Although Adobe tries to keep up with all the various Raw 
formats, you may find a camera using a format not supported by the Raw 
plug-in. Be sure to check updates online for Photoshop Elements. As new 
developments occur, Adobe makes an effort to update plug-ins to support 
newer formats.
Acquiring Camera Raw images
If you read through the first part of this chapter, you know how to acquire 
images from your camera and copy them to your hard drive. We don’t bother 
going through those steps again; we just assume that you have some Camera 
Raw images on your hard drive. That’s where you want them, anyway. Opening 
files from your hard drive is much faster than working off media cards.
To open a Camera Raw image, follow these steps:

86
Par t II: Getting Organized 
 
1. Open the image by pressing Ctrl/Ô+O and selecting it in the Open 
dialog box.
 
 If you want to select several images in a row, click the first image, hold 
down the Shift key, and then click the last image. If you want to select 
several nonadjacent images, Ctrl/Ô-click each image.
 
2. Click Open in the Open dialog box.
 
 If you’re selecting multiple images, only one image appears in the Camera 
Raw dialog box. When you click Open, the next image opens in the 
Camera Raw dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-11.

 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
 
 As you can see in Figure 4-11, you can use a vast number of options to 
post-process your image before you drop it into Elements. This window 
is like a digital darkroom, where you can process the film and see what 
you’re doing to the image before you accept the changes.
 
3. Choose from the options to post-process your images.
 
 If you have your monitor properly calibrated, as we explain in Chapter 
2, all the adjustments you make for Camera Raw format are dynamically 
updated in the image preview. Don’t be shy. Poke around and adjust set-
tings to see the results in the preview area. The more you play with the 
settings, the more you find out how to get the best out of Camera Raw.
A large number of settings are in the Camera Raw window, as the following 
list describes; mark this section to refer to when you work with Camera Raw 
images:
 
✓ Tools: Nine tools appear in the window:
 
• Zoom: Zooms in and out of the image preview.
 
• Hand: Moves the image around, like it does in the Elements image 
window.
 
• Eyedropper: Samples color in the image. We cover using the 
Elements Eyedropper tools in Chapter 12, and that information 
also applies to using the Eyedropper in the Camera Raw window.
 
• Crop tool: Draw a marquee with the Crop tool and make your color 
and brightness adjustments. The adjustments are applied only to 
the area defined by the Crop tool. When you click Open Image, the 
photo opens cropped to the area you marked with the Crop tool.
 
• Straighten tool: The Straighten tool enables you to draw a horizon-
tal axis to straighten a crooked photo.
 
• Red Eye Removal: Click the Red Eye Removal tool to remove red-
eye caused by flash lighting.
 
• Open Preferences dialog box (Ctrl/Ô+K): Click this tool to open the 
Camera Raw Preferences dialog box, where you can make some 
choices for saving image settings, change default image settings, 
and use the Adobe Digital Negative (DNG) format.
 
• Rotate Left: This tool appears first to rotate counterclockwise.
 
• Rotate Right: The last tool you see below the title bar is used to 
rotate clockwise.
 
 The last two rotation tools are self-explanatory.
 
✓ Preview: Check the box to show dynamic previews of your edits.

88
Par t II: Getting Organized 
 
✓ Shadow/Highlight Clipping: 
The Shadow and Highlight 
buttons above the histogram 
denoted by up-pointing arrows 
show clipping in the shadows 
(dark areas of the image) and 
highlights (light areas of the 
image). Clipping means that, in 
a certain area, some data and, 
ultimately, some detail have 
been lost in an image. Think 
of clipping as something that 
you don’t want to appear in 
your pictures. When you make 
adjustments with these two 
check boxes selected, shadow 
clipping is shown in blue and highlight clipping is shown in red in the 
image preview. Take a look at Figure 4-12, in which we exaggerate clip-
ping to show how the clipping preview appears.
 
✓ RGB values: These values appear below the histogram. When you first 
open an image, you don’t see any values in the RGB area. Click the 
Zoom tool, the Hand tool, or the Eyedropper tool and move the cursor 
over the image preview. When you move any of these tools around the 
image, the RGB values corresponding to the point below the cursor are 
reported in this area.
 
✓ Histogram: This graph displays all three channels (red, green, and blue) 
in an image simultaneously. The histogram changes when you change 
other options in the Camera Raw window.
 
 The histogram graphs how pixels in an image are distributed. The distri-
bution includes the number of pixels at each color-intensity level (one of 
the 256 levels you can find out about in Chapter 3).
 
 If images have pixels concentrated in the shadows, you see the histo-
gram skewed to the left. Conversely, images with pixels concentrated in 
the highlights reveal a histogram skewed to the right.
 
 When you begin to understand histograms better, you can develop your 
skill to the point where a quick glance at the histogram provides you 
with a clue to what adjustments you need to make to improve images.
 
✓ Detail icons: The three icons change the pane below the histogram. The 
Basic choices are shown in Figure 4-11. Click the Detail icon to apply 
sharpening and noise reduction, as shown in Figure 4-13, or click the 
Camera Calibration icon to select a camera profile.
 
✓ Settings (pop-up menu): This pop-up menu opens when you click the 
small icon on the far right of the Basic tab. From this menu, you have 
choices for applying settings to the open image. If you change any set-
ting, the menu option changes to Custom. If you previously made setting 
Figure 4-12: Shadow clipping appears in red, 
and highlight clipping appears in blue.

89
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
choices on a Camera Raw image and want 
to return to the shot as it was taken by the 
camera, open the image and select Camera 
Raw Defaults.
 
 Another option is Previous Conversion. 
This selection is handy if you have a col-
lection of images that all require the same 
settings. After adjusting the first image, 
open additional images and select Previous 
Conversion. The Camera Raw plug-in applies 
the last settings you made to a Camera Raw 
image to the currently open file.
 
 Sharpening sharpens images. You can 
choose to sharpen images in the Camera Raw 
window or in Elements. Try to avoid sharp-
ening here and use the sharpening tools in 
Elements, as we explain in Chapter 9.
 
 Noise Reduction includes options for adjust-
ing the luminance and color. You’ve probably 
seen images with a lot of noise. In extreme 
cases, they look like the pictures were 
printed on sandpaper. Noise in an image is 
okay if that’s an effect you intentionally apply 
to a picture. However, if you want a smooth-
looking image, you have to eliminate any 
noise introduced by the camera. Luminance 
Smoothing reduces grayscale noise. The next 
setting is Color Noise Reduction, which is 
used to reduce color noise.
 
✓ White Balance: White Balance settings 
(available in the Basic tab — the far-left icon 
below the histogram, as shown in Figure 4-11) are used to adjust the 
color balance of an image to reflect the lighting conditions under which 
the shot was originally taken. Think of the sensor in a digital camera 
capable of capturing the entire range of white balance the sensor can 
see. You make a choice not necessarily for what you see, but rather for 
the white balance for the shot you took. Therefore, if your camera is set 
for taking pictures under one set of lighting conditions, then you move 
to another set of lighting conditions and forget to change the settings, 
you can let the Camera Raw plug-in make a correction for the white bal-
ance because the sensor picked up the entire range, and the necessary 
data is contained in the file.
 
 In Figure 4-14, you can see a picture taken with the camera set for tung-
sten lighting, but the shot was taken outdoors in daylight. By changing 
the White Balance in the Camera Raw dialog box, you can see how the 
settings affect the image color.
Figure 4-13: Click the triangle icon below 
the histogram to open the Detail tab, 
which includes options for sharpness 
and noise reduction.

Figure 4-14: Changing White Balance can dramatically change the image color.
 
✓ Temperature: If one of the preset White Balance options doesn’t quite 
do the job, you can move the Temperature slider or edit the text box 
to settle on values between one White Balance choice and another. Use 
this item to fine-tune the White Balance.
 
✓ Tint: Tint is another fine-tuning adjustment affected by White Balance. 
This slider and text box are used to correct any green or magenta tints 
that might appear in a photo.
 
✓ Brightness adjustments: Several adjustment sliders and text boxes help 
you control the image brightness and tonal range. Notice the Exposure 
setting. This item lets you correct photos taken at the wrong exposure. 
In analog darkrooms, you might ask technicians to push or pull film 
during processing, which results in longer and shorter processing times. 

91
 Chapter 4: Get ting Your Images
Changing exposure times compensates for under- and overexposing 
film. A nice advantage of using Camera Raw is that you can change the 
exposure for one image and then later open the original raw image and 
change to a different exposure value. Analog film can’t be reprocessed, 
but with Camera Raw, you can reprocess over and over again.
 
 Other options for the brightness and tonal controls are similar to the 
choices you have in the Elements Full Edit mode. For more information 
on these adjustments, see Chapter 10.
 
✓ Cancel/Reset: When you open the Camera Raw window, the button 
you see by default is Cancel. Press the Alt key, and the button changes 
to Reset. If you want to scrub all the settings you made and start over, 
press Alt and click Reset.
 
✓ Open Image/Open Copy: This single button has two different purposes:
 
• Open Image: This button is the default. Click Open after you choose 
all your settings to process the photo and open it in Elements.
 
• Open Copy: Press the Alt key, and the button changes to Open 
Copy. Click Open Copy to open a copy of the raw image.
 
✓ Done: Clicking Done doesn’t open the image in Full Edit mode. Click Done 
after making changes to the settings, and the new settings become the 
new defaults for your Raw image. You can clear the defaults by opening 
the pop-up menu and selecting Camera Raw Defaults.
 
✓ Zoom: In this drop-down menu, you can choose from several zoom pre-
sets. You can also edit the text box, click the minus (–) button to zoom 
out, or click the plus (+) button to zoom in. Using any option zooms the 
Image preview.
 
✓ Help: Clicking this button opens a Help document to assist you in under-
standing more about Camera Raw.
 
✓ Save Image: Click the Save Image button to open the Save Options 
dialog box, where you can rename the image to save a copy and make 
choices for saving in Adobe’s DNG format.
 
✓ Depth: If your camera is capable of shooting higher bit depths, they’re 
listed here. If you want to convert to 8-bit images for printing, you can 
select the option from the drop-down menu.
All we can hope to provide in this book is a simple cursory view for using 
Camera Raw. Several entire books have been written exclusively covering 
the Camera Raw format and how to open files in the Camera Raw plug-in 
window. For a more detailed look at using Camera Raw, see Color Management 
for Digital Photographers For Dummies, by Ted Padova and Don Mason 
(Wiley).

Viewing and Finding Your Images
In This Chapter
▶ Viewing photos in the Organizer
▶ Navigating the Image window
▶ Sorting photos
▶ Searching for photos
T
he Organizer is a powerful tool that helps you locate files and keeps your 
photos arranged and organized. You can easily access the Organizer by 
clicking the Organizer button on the menu bar while you’re in one of the edit-
ing modes. Or, when you open the Welcome screen, click the Organize button.
In this chapter, you can discover how to view and organize your pictures in 
the Organizer and the Image window, and how the many options help 
speed up your work in Photoshop Elements.
The Many Faces of the Organizer
The default Organizer view is like a slide sorter, 
and this view is one you’re likely to use in all your 
Elements work sessions. The Organizer provides an 
efficient means to access the photos you want to 
open in one of the editors. Just double-click a photo 
in the Organizer, and you see the image zoom in size 
to fill an Organizer window. You can carefully examine 
the photo to be certain that it’s the one you want and 
then just select which editor you want to use from the 
Editor drop-down list on the menu bar, from the context 
menu you open on the image in the Organizer window, or by 
clicking the Fix button in the Panels Bin.
In addition to the default view in the Organizer, you have some other oppor-
tunities for examining your pictures. You can view pictures in a slide show, 
or you can view pictures side by side to compare them.

Adding files to the default Organizer view
Before you explore alternative viewing options in the Organizer, take a look 
at how you add photos to the thumbnail images you see in the Organizer 
window.
After copying the photos to your hard drive, as we explain in Chapter 
4, here’s how you add those files to an existing group of images in the 
Organizer:
 
1. View the photos that you want to add to the Organizer window.
 
 Be certain that you have photos in the Organizer window.
 
2. In the Organizer, choose File➪Get Photos➪From Files and Folders.
 
 The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 5-1.
 
View menu
 
Figure 5-1: The Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box.
 
3. From the View menu (shown in Figure 5-1), choose Large icons (or 
Medium icons).
 
 In Large icon (or Medium icon) view, thumbnail images of most of your 
files appear in a scrollable list large enough to see some detail. (Note: 
You might not see Camera Raw files and some files saved in different for-
mats.) This view makes it easy to locate the files you want to add to the 
Organizer. For example, if you want to load only Camera Raw images, you 
can easily see them represented as icons, rather than the image previews.

95
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
4. Select files to add to the Organizer window.
 
 Click a thumbnail and use either the Shift key or the Ctrl/Ô key to select 
additional photos. When you hold down Shift and click, all photos 
between the first thumbnail and the thumbnail you Shift-click are 
selected. When you Ctrl/Ô-click, you can select additional noncontigu-
ous photos.
 
5. Click Get Photos to add the selected photos to the Organizer window.
 
6. Add the new photos to the Organizer window you originally opened 
by clicking the Back button on the Shortcuts bar.
 
 The photos you add to the Organizer may appear out of order when 
you’re viewing them in the Organizer. Depending on the sort order, 
which we explain in the section “Sorting Your Photos,” later in this chap-
ter, the additional photos you added to the Organizer can appear before 
or after, or integrated within, the original photos. Use the scroll bar in 
the Organizer to view the added photos.
Changing the Organizer display
When you open the Organizer, the default view is a Thumbnail display. Your 
photos, videos, projects, audio files, and so on are shown with a mini image 
or icon that can be adjusted to different sizes. In the Shortcuts bar, a slider 
can be moved left to create smaller 
thumbnail views or right to create 
larger thumbnail views in the 
Organizer window.
The Thumbnail display is one of 
many options for viewing photos 
and other files in the Organizer. A 
quick glance at the Display drop-
down menu shows some alternate 
views available to you, as shown in 
Figure 5-2.
Import Batch view
Below the default option for Thumbnail views, you find Import Batch. Open 
the Display menu and then select Import Batch, or press Ctrl/Ô+Alt+2 on 
your keyboard. The display in the Organizer keeps the view set to thumb-
nails, but the order of your files changes to a date order according to the 
date you imported files with the Get Photos and Videos command, which we 
discuss in Chapter 4. This view can be helpful if you want to organize images 
according to the batch you imported on a given day.
Figure 5-2: Click Display in the menu bar to see 
the options for alternate views in the Organizer.

Par t II: Get ting Organized 
Folder Location view
What’s nifty about the Folder Location display is that you can peruse your 
hard drive for all files and folders while you remain in the Organizer window. 
Just select Folder Location from the Display menu or press Ctrl/Ô+Alt+3 to 
make an Explorer sidebar show you your hard drive(s), network locations, 
and offline media.
Choose Folder Location to make the view change to the display shown in 
Figure 5-3. When you want to poke around a folder, right-click and select 
Reveal in Explorer from the context menu. A Windows Explorer window 
opens on top of the Organizer window and shows you all the files contained 
in that folder.
 
 
Figure 5-3: Choose Folder Location from the Display menu and then right-click to open a 
 
context menu.
When you find an image you want to edit, right-click and choose Open 
With➪Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 (Editor). The image then opens 
in Full Edit mode in Elements.
 
When you want more of the screen window dedicated to seeing the files in 
the Organizer, hide the Panels Bin by clicking the separator bar. One click 
on the tiny right-pointing arrow on the separator bar hides the panel. Click 
the arrow on a collapsed panel to reopen that panel. In Figure 5-3, you see 
the Organizer window with the Panels Bin hidden, thereby displaying more 
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.

97
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
Date view
Choose Date View ( Ctrl/Ô+Alt+D) from the 
Display menu to change your Organizer window 
to a calendar showing you the dates your images 
were shot. The date information is derived from 
metadata imported with your images that were 
recorded by your camera. (For more information 
on metadata, see “Searching metadata,” later in 
this chapter.)
If you shoot many pictures on a given date, the 
images are stacked on the calendar for that date. 
In the Project Bin, you find arrows that are used 
to scroll the stacked images left or right, and a 
number appears in the lower-left corner of the 
image thumbnail view. In Figure 5-4, the numbers 
appear as 5 of 6; on April 13, 2008 (the date at the 
top of the thumbnail), six photos were taken, and 
the current view is the fifth photo in the stacked 
order.
To return to the Organizer thumbnail display, click the binoculars icon or 
press Ctrl/Ô+Alt+O (the letter O, not zero).
Show Map
How would you like to see a visual display of where your photos were taken 
geographically? Photoshop Elements 7 provides you the answer with Yahoo! 
Maps and an option for placing your photos on a world map.
To open Yahoo! Maps in Elements, open the Display menu in the Shortcuts 
bar and choose Show Maps. The Map panel on the left side of the Organizer 
window opens, as shown in Figure 5-5.
 
You must have an Internet connection active on your computer to work with 
Yahoo! Maps.
To map the location of photos shown in the Organizer to Yahoo! Maps, you 
can choose from a couple different options:
 
✓ Select photos in the Organizer and drag them to a map location on the 
map in the Map panel.
 
✓ Select photos in the Organizer and right-click one of the selected 
photos. From the menu options, choose Place on Map. In the dialog box 
that opens, type a city name and click the Find button. If more than one 
city is reported in the dialog box, click the city name you want to use for 
the mapped photos.
Figure 5-4: The Project Bin 
shows a thumbnail view of a 
photo with scroll arrows and

Figure 5-5: Choose Show Map from the Display menu to open Yahoo! Maps.
To move around the map, place the cursor inside the Yahoo! Map panel and 
drag the map with the Hand tool within the panel window. If you go too far 
left, don’t worry; the Asian, Indian, and Eastern European countries are found 
by dragging right across the Atlantic and eastward. Dragging left stops some-
where around the International Date Line; so, if you live in Singapore, you 
need to keep dragging right to find your country.
Zooming in the Map panel is handled by the tools you see at the bottom of 
the map. Use the Zoom In tool to find cities and road maps in a detailed view. 
Use the Zoom Out tool after you find the location you want to use.
After you add photos to the map, you can view the images by clicking the red 
pin placed on the map each time that you add photos to a location. Click 
the red pin to open a pop-up window that shows a thumbnail view of the 
current photo with smaller photos in a slide organizer below the primary 
image thumbnail, as shown in Figure 5-6. Click the left and right arrows in the 
pop-up window to scroll the slides. Clicking the current image thumbnail in 
the pop-up window opens the image in a slide show view. To find out more 
about slide show views, see the following section.

99
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
In the Map panel, you can choose 
from several display options in the 
drop-down menu on the bottom-
right side of the panel. Choose from 
the default Map, a Hybrid map, or 
Satellite map. Choose Satellite to 
locate Uncle Jeremy’s house, where 
the last family reunion took place 
and you shot all those wonderful 
pictures.
To close the Map panel, return to 
the Display menu and choose Show 
Map again. The panel collapses, 
and you’re back to the standard 
Organizer view.
 
When you view panels in Elements, 
drag the vertical separator bar on a 
panel to widen the panel or reduce 
the panel size. Look for the arrow-
head on the vertical bar separating 
the Organizer window from a panel, 
and click and drag left or right to 
change panel sizes.
Viewing photos in a slide show (Full Screen view)
Are you ready for some exciting viewing in Photoshop Elements? To take an 
alternative view of your Organizer files, you can see your pictures in a self-
running slide show (in Full Screen view), complete with transition effects and 
background music. Full Screen view takes you to a slide show view. For the pur-
poses of clarity, think of Full Screen view and viewing a slide show as the same 
thing. Full-screen viewing temporarily hides the Elements tools and menus, and 
gives you the most viewing area on your monitor to see your pictures.
 
Viewing files in slide show mode can be helpful for quickly previewing the 
files you want to edit for all kinds of output, as well as for previewing photos 
that you might use for an exported slide show, which we explain in Chapter 15.
Setting up your images for viewing
To set up your slide show and/or enter Full Screen view, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Organizer.
Figure 5-6: Click a red pin to open a pop-up

 If no images are selected when you enter Full Screen view, all photos in 
the Organizer window are shown in Full Screen view.
 
3. Choose Display➪View Photos in Full Screen (or press F11 on your 
keyboard).
 
 The Full Screen View Options dialog box, shown in Figure 5-7, opens.

Moving around the Image Window
When you edit images in either Quick Edit or Full Edit mode, you continually 
interact with the Image window. Whether you’re zooming in and out of a single 
window or viewing multiple windows, you need to work comfortably in this area 
for all your editing tasks. To help you move around the Image window, Elements 
provides a rich set of tools. If you become familiar with the many viewing 
options and keyboard shortcuts available in Elements, all your editing jobs will 
be much easier. The tools, menu commands, and panels we describe in the fol-
lowing sections are essential for just about everything you do in Elements.
Zooming in and out of images
Zooming in and out of images is a task you perform routinely while editing 
images in the Image window and also when working in other windows, such 
as the Camera Raw window and the Full Screen View window. Zooming in is 
Figure 5-10: The Action drop-
down menu.

 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
necessary when you want to precisely edit a section of an image or examine 
detail in a small area. You then need to zoom out to see the edits as they 
compare to the entire image.
Zoom by clicking
The Zoom tool appears on the Tools panel. To use the tool for zooming in 
and out, follow these steps to take a look at how it all works:
 
1. Click the Zoom tool on the Tools panel to select it (or simply press Z).
 
2. Move the cursor, now loaded with the Zoom tool, to the Image 
window and click the place where you want to zoom.
 
 To zoom in more, click again; keep clicking until you zoom in far enough.
 
3. To zoom out of an image, keep the Zoom tool selected, hold down the 
Alt key, and click.
 
 The cursor changes to a magnifying glass tool with a minus (–) symbol 
when you hold down the Alt key.
Zoom to a selection
Another way to change a view is to zoom to a target area in an image. Here’s 
how:
 
1. Click the Zoom tool on the 
Tools panel.
 
2. Drag a box around the area 
you want to zoom.
 
 A dashed rectangle marquee 
appears, as shown in Figure 5-11.
 
3. Move the rectangle marquee if 
you need to adjust the selection.
 
 Now, it’s time to get fancy. If 
you have a marquee drawn 
with the Zoom tool and the size 
appears just right, but you want 
to move the rectangle, press the 
spacebar while you keep the 
mouse button pressed. You can drag the marquee rectangle anywhere in 
the image to zoom to the area defined by the rectangle boundary.
 
4. Release the mouse button.
 
 The view zooms to fit the space defined by the marquee rectangle.

panel and drag around an area you want to 
zoom.

Using the Options bar
Above the Image window and below the Shortcuts bar, you find the Options 
bar. The Options bar is ever-changing, offering different options when you 
select different tools on the Tools panel. When you click the Zoom tool, the 
Options bar changes, as shown in Figure 5-12. You have many similar choices 
for zooming in and out of images and a few options unique to the Options bar:
 
 
Figure 5-12: Click the Zoom tool on the Tools panel to make the Options bar change to reflect 
 
choices for zooming in and out of images.
 
✓ Zoom In/Zoom Out tools: You can choose Zoom In or Zoom Out as 
separate tools to avoid using the Alt key to toggle between the two.
 
✓ Zoom percentage: This figure shows you the current zoom level as a 
percentage. You can edit the text by typing values between 5 and 3200.
 
✓ Zoom slider: Click the down-pointing arrow to open a slider bar. Drag 
the slider left to zoom out or right to zoom in.
 
✓ Resize Windows to Fit: Select this check box to resize the window along 
with the image zoom. Deselect the box to zoom in and out of an image 
while the Image window remains at a fixed size.
 
✓ Ignore Palettes: This check box is selected when you select the Resize 
Windows to Fit check box. Selecting this box ignores panels when you’re 
using the Zoom tool, so you can zoom to an area covered by the panels. If 
you deselect the box, you can’t zoom to an area beneath the Project Bin.
 
✓ Zoom All Windows: If you have multiple images open and select this 
check box, zooming with the Zoom tool zooms all open documents 
simultaneously.
 
✓ 1:1: Zooms the current window to a 1-to-1 ratio, showing the zoom level 
at which the file will be printed.
 
✓ Fit Screen: Click this button to fit the image within the Image window.
 
✓ Print Size: Often, this option shows you the same size as 1:1, where the 
image is zoomed to the size of the print file.
Viewing multiple documents
When you need to view two or more images at one time, choose Window➪
Images to open a submenu of viewing options used for viewing multiple files. 
The Window menu also provides a list of all your open documents. Here’s a 
list of options you find on the submenu:

107
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
✓ Maximize Mode: In Maximize mode, you see only one Image window 
and lose the option for resizing the window by dragging the lower-right 
corner in or out. If you want to bring back the title bar and the resizing 
options, choose Window➪Images➪Maximize Mode again. Notice the 
Maximize Mode check box; click it to remove the check mark on the 
submenu and minimize the Image window.
 
✓ Tile: Tiling images reduces Image window sizes to a size that accom-
modates viewing all images in scrollable windows within the Elements 
workspace. Choose Window➪Images➪Tile when multiple images are 
open to get a view similar to the one shown to Figure 5-13.
Figure 5-13: Open several images in one of the editing modes and choose Window➪
Images➪Tile to show all Image windows.
 
✓ Cascade: Choose Window➪Images➪Cascade to make the Image win-
dows overlap each other in a cascading view.
 
✓ Match Zoom: Set the zoom level for one of several images open in 
Elements and choose Window➪Images➪Match Zoom. All open docu-
ments are zoomed to the same level as the foreground image.
 
✓ Match Location: If you zoom in to, for example, the upper-right corner 
and then select Match Location, all open images zoom to the same 
location in the respective photos.

108
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
✓ Bring Image to Foreground: When you open photos, the open docu-
ments are listed by name on the Window menu. The active document is 
the foreground image. If you want to edit another image, choose Window 
and select the image you want to edit. That image comes to the fore-
ground as the active image.
 
 Although you can use a menu command to bring images to the fore-
ground and make them active, you can perform the same action by 
clicking an image thumbnail in the Project Bin.
Using pan and zoom
When you zoom in on a document larger than the Image window can accom-
modate, scroll bars provide a means for moving the image inside the window. 
Moving the image around a window is panning the image.
You can also use the Hand tool to pan the image. Zoom in to an image and 
click the Hand tool. Click and drag the image around the window. If you want 
to zoom in or out while the Hand tool is selected, hold down the Ctrl/Ô key, 
and the Hand tool temporarily changes to the Zoom In tool. Hold down Ctrl/
Ô+Alt to temporarily change the Hand tool to the Zoom Out tool.
Using the Navigator panel
The Navigator panel affords you several different options for both zooming 
and panning an image.
To open the Navigator panel, choose 
Window➪Navigator. The Navigator 
panel, as shown in Figure 5-14, opens 
as a floating panel in the Elements 
workspace. (For more information 
on floating panels, see Chapter 1.)
While you select options for zooming 
on the Navigator panel, the image 
preview in the Panel window stays 
fixed to show you the entire image. 
When you zoom in and out inside 
the panel, the corresponding zoom 
is applied to the active document.
 
Either use the zoom tools on the 
panel or drag the slider left and right 
to zoom in and out. If you place the 
cursor inside the image preview 
thumbnail, you can drag a rectangle 
and zoom into the image.
Figure 5-14: The Navigator panel.

 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
Using the Navigator panel can be particularly helpful if you use two monitors. 
Just drag the Navigator panel to your second monitor, where you can change 
zoom levels without having the panel obscure the background image.
Sorting Your Photos
With all the Photoshop Elements modes and workspaces, you need a consis-
tent starting place to handle all your editing tasks. Think of the Organizer as 
Grand Central Station, and from this central location, you can take the Long 
Island Railroad to any destination you desire. In Elements terms, rather than 
head out to Port Washington, you travel to an editing mode. Rather than go 
to the Hamptons, you journey through all the creation areas. In short, the 
Organizer is the central depot on the Photoshop Elements map.
In addition to being a tool to navigate to other workspaces, the Organizer is a 
management tool you can use to organize, sort, search, and describe photos 
with identity information. In terms of sorting and organizing files, Elements 
provides many different options, and we cover them all in the following 
sections.
Using sort commands
One quick way to sort images in the Organizer 
is to use the menu in the Shortcuts bar in the 
Organizer window for date sorting. Two options 
are available to you, as shown in Figure 5-15.
The sorting options available to you from the 
menu are
 
✓ Date (Newest First): Select this option to 
view images according to the date you took 
the photos, beginning with the most recent date.
 
✓ Date (Oldest First): This option displays photos in chronological order, 
starting with the oldest file.
As we mention in the section “Changing the Organizer display,” earlier in 
this chapter, you can also view files according to the Import Batch date and 
Folder Locations. Under the Display menu you have options for
 
✓ Import Batch: You might import a batch of photos in one Photoshop 
Elements session and import another batch in the same session or in 
another session. When you select Import Batch, the images appear 
organized in groups, according to the date the batch was created.
Figure 5-15: You can quickly 
sort files in date ascending or 
descending order.

110
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
✓ Folder Location: Click Folder Location to make an Explorer pane appear 
on the left side of the Organizer window. You can browse your hard 
drive for folder locations and select a folder containing images you 
imported into the Organizer.
Sorting media types
Photos can also be sorted according to media type. Elements supports view-
ing photos, video files, audio files, projects, and Adobe PDF files. To select 
different media types, choose View➪Media Types, and a submenu offers 
options for viewing the different media types. Select a menu item from the 
submenu to make all media types matching the menu command appear in the 
Organizer window.
Using Search Options
The Organizer’s Find menu is devoted entirely to searching photos. From the 
Find menu, you can locate photos in collections, catalogs, and the Organizer 
window according to a variety of different search criteria.
To use the commands on the Find menu, you need to have photos loaded in 
the Organizer window, or create collections or catalogs, which we explain 
in Chapter 6. The categories in the following sections can be searched in the 
Organizer.
Searching by date
When you have a number of different files in an Organizer window from 
photos shot on different dates, you can narrow your search to find photos, 
and all other types of files supported by Elements, through a date search.
Be careful, though. The date is taken from the camera metadata; but if a date 
isn’t available from the camera data, the date is taken from the file creation 
date. The creation date is not likely to be the date you shot the photo.
To search files by date, follow these steps:
 
1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then 
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
 
 To open files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files and 
Folders submenu command.

111
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
 
2. Select a date range by choos-
ing Find➪Set Date Range.
 
 The Set Date Range dialog box, 
shown in Figure 5-16, opens.
 
3. Specify the dates.
 
 Type a year in the Start Date 
Year text box. Select the month 
and day from the Month and 
Day drop-down lists. Repeat the 
same selections for the end date.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The thumbnails shown in the Organizer window include only files cre-
ated within the specified date range.
Searching for untagged items
You can tag files with a number of different criteria, as we explain in Chapter 
6. When tags are added to images, you can sort files according to tag labels. 
We cover sorting by tag labels in Chapter 6, too. For now, take a look at the 
Find menu and notice the Untagged Items command. If you haven’t added 
tags to some items and want to show only the untagged files so that you can 
begin to add tags, choose Find➪Untagged Items or press Ctrl/Ô+Shift+Q. 
Elements displays all files without tags in the Organizer window.
Searching collections
Collections are among many items we address in Chapter 6. You can create 
collections and then select a collection on the Collections panel. Selecting a 
collection is like having a first level of sorting. You can then search by date 
or other sort options discussed in the preceding and following sections to 
narrow the choices.
Searching captions and notes
In Chapter 6, we talk about adding captions and notes to your files. When 
captions or notes are added to files, you can search for the caption name, 
contents of a note, or both. To search caption names and notes, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open files in the Organizer by choosing File➪Get Photos and then 
choosing a submenu command for acquiring files.
 
 If you’re opening files stored on your hard drive, choose the From Files 
and Folders submenu command.
Figure 5-16: Open the Set Date Range dialog 
box and specify the start and end dates.

112
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
2. Choose Find➪By Caption 
or Note.
 
 The Find by Caption or Note 
dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 5-17.
 
 Options in the dialog box are
 
• Find Items with Caption or 
Note: In the text box, type 
the words you want to 
locate.
 
• Match Only the Beginning 
of Words in Captions and Notes: Click this radio button when you 
know that your caption or note begins with words you type in the 
text box.
 
• Match Any Part of Any Word in Captions or Notes: Click this radio 
button if you’re not sure whether the text typed in the box is used 
at the beginning of a caption or note, or whether it’s contained 
within the caption name or note text.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The Results appear in the Organizer window.
Searching by history
Elements keeps track of what you do with your photos, such as printing, 
e-mailing, sharing, and performing a number of other tasks. You can search 
for files based on the file history by choosing Find➪By History. Selecting 
options on the By History submenu reports files found on date searches 
meeting the history criteria.
Searching metadata
Metadata includes information about your images that’s supplied by digital 
cameras as well as custom data you add to a file. Metadata contains descrip-
tions of the image, such as your camera name, the camera settings you used 
to take a picture, copyright information, and much more.
Searching metadata is easy. Just choose Find➪By Details (Metadata) in the 
Organizer. The Find by Details (Metadata) dialog box opens. The first two col-
umns in the dialog box offer a number of different choices for search criteria 
and options according to the criteria. In the third column, you specify exactly 
what you want to search by typing search criteria in the text box. Clicking the 
plus button adds new lines to add more criteria to the search, as shown in 
Figure 5-18, and clicking the minus button deletes a line.
Figure 5-17: Choose Find➪By Caption or Note 
to open the dialog box in which search criteria 
for captions and notes are specified.

113
 Chapter 5: Viewing and Finding Your Images
Searching faces
If a magical method is avail-
able to you for searching files 
in Elements, it has to be search-
ing for faces. When you choose 
Find➪Find Faces for Tagging, 
Elements searches through 
files you select in the Organizer 
window and examines each image 
for a face — Homo sapiens faces, 
to be exact.
 
Note that you should first select 
image thumbnails in the Organizer 
window and then choose 
Find➪Find Faces for Tagging. If 
you don’t select files, Elements 
searches the entire catalog. Be 
aware that if you search through a large catalog, Elements takes some time to 
complete the search.
The results of the search magically include all photos containing faces in a 
new Organizer window. Although the command is intended to identify images 
you can tag, you can use the command for invoking a search and choosing to 
view all files containing faces.

metadata are specified.

▶ Creating catalogs
▶ Working with albums
▶ Creating stacks and versions
▶ Adding captions and notes
▶ Batch processing files
▶ Backing up files
D
ownloading a bunch of media cards filled with photos 
and leaving them in folders distributed all over your 
hard drive is like having a messy office with papers 
stacked all over your desk. Trying to find a file, even 
with all the great search capabilities we cover in 
Chapter 5, can take you as much time as sorting 
through piles of papers. What you need is a good 
file-management system.
In this chapter, we talk about organizing and anno-
tating files, and the important task of backing up 
files. Be certain to take a little time to understand 
the organizational methods that Elements offers, keep 
your files organized when you copy them to your hard 
drive, and back up files to CDs or DVDs. The time you 
invest in organizing your pictures helps you quickly locate 
files when you need them.

116
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags
Elements provides you with a great opportunity for organizing files, in the 
form of keyword tags. After you acquire your images in the Organizer, as we 
discuss in Chapter 4, sort them out and add some permanent keyword tags 
according to the dates you took the pictures, the subject matter, or some 
other categorical arrangement.
 
Keyword tags are referred to as collections in Elements 5 and earlier.
In the Organizer window, two panels help you sort your pictures and keep 
them well organized. You use the Keyword Tags panel (which we talk about 
in the section “Working with keyword tags,” later in this chapter) to identify 
individual images by using a limitless number of options for categorizing 
your pictures. On the Keyword Tags panel, you can create keyword tags and 
collection groups to neatly organize files.
 
Keyword tags are handy when you want to use the many different project 
options, which we explain in Chapter 16. You create a keyword tag from files 
stored in various folders on your hard drive and preview the images to be 
used in a creation. Select the images you want to use when creating slide 
shows and photo albums, for example. When you finish with the creations, 
go back and delete the keyword tag.
In the following sections, you can find out how to create and manage key-
word tags.
Creating a new keyword tag
To create a new keyword tag and add photos to the tag, follow these steps:
 
1. Open photos in the Organizer.
 
 Open the Organizer window by clicking the Organizer button in an 
editing mode or by selecting Organize on the Welcome screen. Choose 
File➪Get Photos and Videos➪From Files and Folders. Note that you 
should have copied some photos to your hard drive, as we explain in 
Chapter 4.
 
2. To create a new keyword tag, click the plus sign (+) icon in the 
Keyword Tags panel to open a drop-down menu and then choose 
New Keyword Tag.
 
 The Create Keyword Tag dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-1.
 
3. Type a name for the tag in the Name text box and add a note to 
describe the keyword tag.
 
 You might use the location where you took the photos, the subject 
matter, or other descriptive information for the note.

117
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
4. If you want to assign the key-
word tag to a map location on 
the Yahoo! Maps, as we discuss 
in Chapter 5, click the Place on 
Map button.
 
 When you click Place on Map, a 
dialog box opens in which you 
type a city name for placing the 
image on Yahoo! Maps. Type a 
city name and select the correct 
city from options provided in a 
second dialog box.
 
5. Click OK in the Edit Keyword 
Tag dialog box.
 
 You return to the Organizer 
window.
 
6. In the Organizer window, 
select the photos you want to 
keyword tag.
 
 Click a photo and Shift-click 
another photo to select photos in a group. Click a photo and Ctrl-click 
(Ô-click on the Mac) different photos scattered around the Organizer 
window to select photos in a nonconsecutive order.
 
7. To add a new keyword tag to a photo (or selection of photos), click 
one of the selected photos in the Organizer window and drag the 
photo thumbnail to the New Tag icon in the Keyword Tags panel.
 
 Alternatively, you can drag a tag to the selected photos.
 
 When you release the mouse button, the photos are added to the new 
keyword tag.
 
8. Repeat Steps 3 through 7 to create keyword tags for all the images you 
want to organize.
 
9. To view one or more keyword tags, click the empty square adjacent 
to a keyword tag icon to show the photos within that group in the 
Organizer window.
 
 When you click the empty square, an icon in the shape of a pair of bin-
oculars appears inside the square, as shown in Figure 6-2. All photos 
matching the keyword tags are shown in the Organizer window.
 
To return to viewing all photos in the Organizer, click the binoculars in the 
Tags panel. The square returns to empty and turns off viewing the tagged 
files.

mands from a context menu that 
you open by right-clicking (Control-
clicking on the Mac) a keyword tag 
on the Keyword Tags panel.
In the New drop-down menu, you can 
access these commands:
 
✓ New Keyword Tag: Create 
a new keyword tag, as we 
describe in the steps in the 
preceding section.
 
✓ New Sub-Category: A sub-
category is like a nested 
bookmark. Create a sub-category by selecting New Sub-Category from 
the New menu; a dialog box opens, prompting you to type a name for 
the new sub-category. As an example for how you might use keyword 
tags and sub-categories, you might have a keyword tag named Uncle 
Joe’s Wedding. Then, you might create sub-categories for Bride Dressing 
Room, Ceremony, Family Photos, Reception, and so on.
 
✓ New Category: Choose New Category from the New menu in the 
Keyword Tags panel to open a dialog box that prompts you to type a 
name for the new category. By default, you’ll find predefined category 
names for People, Places, Events, and Other. If you want to add your 
own custom category, use this menu command.
 
✓ From File: If you export a keyword tag, the file is written as XML (eXten-
sible Markup Language). When you choose From File, you can import an 
XML file of a keyword tags file.
 
✓ Save Keyword Tags to a File: You can save keyword tags to a file that 
can be retrieved with the From File command. This option is handy 
when you open a different catalog file and want to import the same col-
lection names created in one catalog file to another catalog file. (See the 
section “Cataloging Files,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Collapse All Keyword Tags: Keyword tags appear like bookmark lists 
that can be collapsed and expanded. An expanded list shows you all the 
sub-category keyword tags. Choose Collapse All Keyword Tags to col-
lapse the list.
 
✓ Expand All Keyword Tags: This command expands a collapsed list.

 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
When you create a new keyword tag, you see a large icon in the Keyword 
Tags panel. The default tags appear with small icons. You can access the 
items that appear below default tags by clicking the right-pointing arrow to 
expand the list.
Right-click (Control-click on the Mac) a collection name to make the following 
menu commands appear:
 
✓ Change <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to a Sub-Category: 
Choose this menu command to change a keyword tag to a keyword 
tag sub-category.
 
✓ Edit <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This menu command opens 
the Edit Keyword Tag dialog box. You can rename a keyword tag, change 
the note, or change the map location in this dialog box. Alternatively, 
you can click the Pencil tool on the Keyword Tags panel to open the 
same dialog box.
 
✓ Delete <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: Select a keyword tag and 
select this menu option to delete a keyword tag. Alternatively, click the 
Trash icon in the panel to delete a keyword tag. Note that deleting a key-
word tag doesn’t delete files.
 
✓ Place on Map: Choose Place on Map to add images to a Yahoo! Map 
location, as we describe in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Remove from Map: Choose this command to remove tags from the 
Yahoo! Maps.
 
✓ Show on Map: This command opens the Yahoo! Maps panel and shows 
the red pin at the map location with which the image(s) are associated.
 
✓ New Search Using <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag: This command 
searches through a catalog and displays all the photos assigned the key-
word tag in the Organizer window.
 
✓ Add Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to Search 
Results: If you select one photo in the Organizer, the number is one. 
Selecting more than one photo changes the number to the total number 
of selected images. When you open a context menu, the selected images 
are added to the keyword tag where the context menu is opened.
 
✓ Exclude Photos with <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag from Search 
Results: Select photos in the Organizer window and choose this com-
mand to exclude the selected photos from the search.
 
✓ Attach <keyword tag name> Keyword Tag to <n> Selected Items: 
Select a file in the Organizer window and choose this command to attach 
the keyword tag to the file.

120
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
Keyword tags are saved automatically with the catalog you work with. By 
default, Elements creates a catalog and auto-saves your work to it. If you 
happen to create another catalog, as we explain in the next section, your 
keyword tags disappear. Be aware of which catalog is open when you create 
keyword tags in order to return to them.
Cataloging Files
When you open files in the Organizer, all your files are saved automatically to 
a catalog. The files themselves aren’t really saved to the catalog, but rather 
links from the catalog to the individual files are saved. Links are like pointers 
that tell the catalog where to look for a file. When you add and delete files, 
the catalog is continually updated.
 
When you open more files in the Organizer, the default catalog file grows, and 
the maximum size of the catalog file is limited only by your available hard 
drive space. Working with a single catalog file has some disadvantages. For 
example, if your catalog file becomes corrupted and unrecoverable, you lose 
all the work you’ve done organizing files into keyword tags. If you work with 
many files, the Organizer performance slows down.
Rather than work with a single catalog file, you can fine-tune your file organi-
zation by creating several catalogs. You might want to organize files accord-
ing to subject matter, dates, locations, or some other division of categories, 
and then create separate catalogs for each category. You can find all the 
details in the sections that follow.
Splitting a big catalog into smaller catalogs
Follow these steps to break off part of a large catalog into a smaller one:
 
1. Open files in the Organizer.
 
 If you have a large collection of files (300 images or more) open in an 
Organizer window, you can start with your open files. If you don’t yet 
have files open, choose File➪Get Photos and Videos and get photos 
from one of the submenu commands to load up the Organizer window.
 
2. Tag files that you want to place in another catalog with keyword tags.
 
 After tagging the files, click the icon adjacent to the keyword tag name 
to show only the tagged files in the Organizer.
 
3. Choose File➪Catalog to open the Catalog Manager dialog box, shown 
in Figure 6-3.
 
 Here’s something to keep in mind when working with catalogs: You don’t 
create or access catalogs by using menu commands. All the aspects of 
working with a catalog are handled in the Catalog Manager dialog box.

121
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
4. Click New.
 
 A dialog box opens, prompting 
you to name your new catalog.
 
5. Type a descriptive name for 
the catalog and click OK.
 
6. Add and delete files in the 
Organizer.
 
 You can delete files that don’t 
belong to your newly created 
catalog topic and add files by 
choosing File➪Get Photos and 
Videos. Furthermore, you can 
add or delete keyword tags, as 
we describe in the preceding 
section. The view you create in 
the Organizer is saved automatically to your new catalog file.
 
 When you delete a file from a catalog, Elements prompts you in a dialog 
box to confirm the deletion. Also, in the dialog box is a check box for 
deleting files from your hard disk. If you click the box, the file is deleted 
from your hard disk. Be certain to exercise caution so that you don’t 
inadvertently delete your only copy of a photo.
Importing photos to a new catalog
To keep your photos organized and your catalog files small, you can start a 
completely new catalog before you import photos. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Catalog and click New in the Catalog dialog box that 
appears.
 
2. When the New Catalog dialog box opens, type a name for the new 
catalog in the File Name text box and then click Save.
 
3. If you want to add free music files installed with Elements, select the 
Import Free Music into All New Catalogs check box.
 
4. Choose File➪Get Photos and Videos to add files to the new catalog.
 
 When the Get Photos from Files and Folders dialog box opens, a list of 
media files appears in the dialog box when the Import Free Music into 
All New Catalogs check box is selected.
 
5. Select the free music files to add to your collection; then navigate 
your hard drive and select the photos you want to add. After you iden-
tify all the files, click Open.
 
 The selected music files and photos are added to your new collection.
Figure 6-3: Choose File➪Catalog to open the 
Catalog Manager dialog box.

Par t II: Get ting Organized 
Switching to a different catalog
When you need to open a different catalog file, choose File➪Catalog and 
select the name of the catalog you want to open. Click Open at the bottom of 
the dialog box to open the selected catalog. The Organizer window changes 
to reflect files contained in that catalog.
Notice the Repair and Optimize buttons in Figure 6-3. If you can’t see thumb-
nail previews of images or open them in one of the editing modes, your cata-
log file might be corrupted. Click the Repair button to try to fix the problem. 
When catalogs get sluggish, you might need to optimize a catalog to gain 
better performance. Click Optimize in the Catalog Manager routinely to keep 
your catalog operating at optimum performance.
Creating Albums
With keyword tags, you can organize files into categories and sub-categories, 
which helps keep your files neatly organized within a catalog. Elements offers 
additional organizing control in the Albums panel. You might want to orga-
nize an album for sharing photos with others on Photoshop.com, assemble 
an album and rate each photo with a range from one to five stars, create a 
slide show, or just use the Albums panel to further segregate images within 
different categories.
Think of a catalog as a parent item and keyword tags albums as its children. 
Within keyword tags, you can use the sort options (discussed in Chapter 5) to 
sort files according to date. If you still have a number of files in an Organizer 
window that are hard to manage, you can create tags that form sub-categories 
within the keyword tags. Additionally, you can create an album out of a 
number of photos within a given keyword tag. For example, you might have a 
huge number of photos taken on a European vacation. Your catalog contains 
all the images taken on that trip. You can then create keyword tags for files 
according to the country visited. You then might rate the photos according to 
the best pictures you took on your trip. The highest-rated images could then 
be assembled in an album and viewed as a slide show.
Rating images
You can rate photos in the Organizer by tagging images with one to five stars. 
You might have some photos that are exceptional, which you want to give a 
five-star rating, whereas poor photos with lighting and focus problems might 
be rated with one star.
In versions earlier than Photoshop Elements 6, you rated photos directly 
in the Organizer window below each photo thumbnail. In Elements 6 and 
Elements 7, you rate photos in the Properties panel or use the Edit➪Ratings 
submenu.

123
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
To rate a file with a star rating, open 
a context menu by right-clicking 
a photo and select Properties 
from that menu. The Properties — 
General panel, shown in Figure 6-4, 
opens. Click a star to rate the photo. 
Alternately, you can click a photo, 
choose Edit➪Ratings, and choose a 
star rating from the submenu that 
appears.
 
Photoshop Elements 7 has changed 
how you view different ratings. Rated 
views are no longer available in the 
Organizer window, like they were in 
earlier versions of Elements. Now, 
you have a menu in the Shortcuts bar, 
which appears in the top-right corner 
of the Organizer window. Notice the 
five stars and the drop-down menu. The menu choices include
 
✓ And Higher: Click a star adjacent to the menu and choose And Higher to 
make the photos with that rating and all ratings above the selected star 
appear in the Organizer window.
 
✓ And Lower: Click a star adjacent to the menu and choose And Lower 
to view all photos rated with the selected star and lower. For example, 
if you click the third star, when you choose the menu command, all 
photos rated with three stars or fewer appear in the Organizer window.
 
✓ Only: If you click five stars (or any other rating) and select Only, only 
the images rated with the selected star are shown in the Organizer 
window.
To return to a view in which all your photos are shown in the Organizer, 
including all photos you haven’t rated, click Show All in the Shortcuts bar.
Adding rated files to an album
You might want to rate images with star ratings and then add all your images 
to an album. Within the album, you can still choose to view your pictures 
according to star ratings.
Creating an album
In the section “Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags,” earlier in 
this chapter, we discuss how creating keyword tags and assigning tags to 
photos help you organize a collection of photos and how sub-categories help 
you break down a collection into additional categories. With albums and star 
Figure 6-4: A collection of photos rated with 
stars.

124
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
ratings, you can further break down a collection into groups that you might 
want to mark for printing, sharing, or onscreen slide shows.
To create an album, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the plus sign (+) icon in 
the Albums panel and choose 
New Album from the drop-
down menu shown in 
Figure 6-5.
 
 The Albums panel expands to 
show the Album Details.
 
2. Name the new album.
 
 Type a name for the album in 
the Album Name text box, as 
shown in Figure 6-6.
 
3. View the Backup/
Synchronization Help.
 
 Click the light bulb to display 
the help information related 
to checking the Backup/
Synchronize check box. Checking this check box protects your files by 
using backup services provided by Photoshop.com.
 
4. Click the help note to dismiss it from view.
 
5. Drag photos from the Organizer to the items window in the Album 
Details panel, shown in Figure 6-6.
 
 Alternately, you can select photos in the Organizer and click the plus 
sign (+) icon to add them to the album.
 
6. Click Done at the bottom of the panel.
 
 Your new album now appears listed in the Albums panel.
That’s it! Your new album is created, and the photos you drag to the album 
are added to it. You can isolate all the photos within a given album by click-
ing the album name in the Albums panel.
 
Creating multiple albums uses only a fraction of the memory that would be 
required if you wanted to duplicate photos for multiple purposes, such as 
printing, Web hosting, sharing, and so on.
Figure 6-5: Click the plus sign (+) icon to open 
the drop-down menu and then choose New

 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Creating a Smart Album
You can perform a search based on 
a number of different criteria. You 
can, for example, rate images with 
stars and choose to view all files with 
three or more stars, or maybe you 
changed camera models and want 
to show only the photos taken with 
your newest camera. You can search 
a catalog for metadata, location, or 
some other criterion. Furthermore, 
you can combine searches, for exam-
ple, first searching for a location 
and then searching the files within a 
given date range.
The point is that after you perform 
a search, you can save the search 
results in the form of a Smart Album. 
After you have all the files shown in 
the Organizer based on the searches 
you perform, you can create a Smart 
Album by opening the New menu in 
the Albums panel and choosing New 
Smart Album.
The New Smart Album dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 6-7. Type a 
name for your new Smart Album and 
make selections for the search cri-
teria below the Name text box. Click 
OK, and the Smart Album is listed 
above the albums in the Albums panel.
Creating an Album Group
The Albums panel contains all the albums and Smart Albums you create in an 
organized list. By default, the albums are listed in alphabetical order. If you 
add many albums to the panel, the list can be long, making it difficult to find 
the album you want to use for a given editing session.

Album Details panel.

126
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
 
Figure 6-7: Type a name for your new Smart Album, add the search 
 
criteria, and click OK to add the album to the Albums panel.
An Album Group is no more than a divider shown in the Albums panel. You 
don’t add photos to the group. You nest albums within a group in a hierarchi-
cal order. To understand how to create an Album Group, follow these steps:
 
1. Create several albums.
 
 To begin, you should have two or more albums added to the Albums 
panel. For example, suppose that you have many photos of a vacation 
trip to Hawaii. You want to divide the photos by images taken at a luau, 
a diving trip, a day on Waikiki Beach, or other similar events that you 
want to group together. For each category, such as Luau, Diving, or 
Waikiki, you create a separate album.
 
2. Create an Album Group by clicking the New menu in the Albums 
panel and choosing New Album Group.
 
 The Create Album Group dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 6-8, 
opens.
 
3. Type a name for the group 
in the Album Group Name 
text box.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 You new Album Group is added 
to the Albums panel.
 
5. Click and drag an album onto 
the Album Group name in the 
Albums panel.
 
 The albums you drag to the 
Album Group are nested within the group, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Figure 6-8: Type a name for your new Album 
Group in the Create Album Group dialog box.

127
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Figure 6-9 shows an expanded Album 
Group, as denoted by the list (below 
Hawaii photos) and the disclosure 
triangle. To collapse a group, click 
the down-pointing arrow. The group 
names remain visible and provide 
you with more viewing space in the 
Albums panel, making it easier to 
scroll long lists.
Like keyword tags, albums can be 
saved to an XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language) file, and the files can be 
loaded in the Albums panel. Open 
the New menu, where you find com-
mands for Save Albums to File and 
From File. You can export an album to 
a file and then copy the file to another 
computer, making it easy to organize 
photos on several computers.
Hiding Files That Get in the Way
Elements offers a few ways to hide files so that you can keep your images 
organized and easy to find.
With a simple menu command, you can mark selected files in the Organizer 
as hidden. You might have several files of the same subject and want to keep 
only one file visible in the Organizer window. However, you may not want to 
delete the other photos. As such, you can hide files in the Organizer window 
and show the hidden files by using menu commands.
Select files you want to hide, and from either the Edit menu or a con-
text menu, choose Visibility➪Mark as Hidden. To see the files you mark 
for hiding, return to the same Visibility menu and choose Show Hidden. 
Essentially, you remove the check mark for Show Hidden, resulting in hiding 
the files. To easily toggle between showing and hiding files marked for hiding, 
choose View➪Hidden Files. Selecting this menu command toggles between 
showing and hiding the files you marked for hiding.
Stacking ’em up
Think of stacks like a stack of cards that are face-up. You see only the front 
card, and all the other cards are hidden behind that card. Stacks work the 
same way. You hide different images behind a foreground image. At any time, 
you can sort the images or display all images in the stack in the Organizer 
window.
Figure 6-9: Albums are nested below an Album 
Group.

128
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
To create a stack, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select several photos.
 
 You can select any number of photos. 
However, you can’t stack audio or movie 
files.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Stack➪Stack Selected Photos.
 
 Elements stacks your photos. The first image 
you select remains in view in the Organizer 
window. In the upper-right area, an icon that 
looks like a stack of cards appears on the 
image thumbnail when you’ve stacked some 
images, as shown in Figure 6-10. The thumb-
nail itself appears as though it sits atop a 
stack of other thumbnails.
After you stack a group of images, you can use the Stack submenu commands 
to manage the photos. Click a stack to select it and then choose Edit➪Stack. 
The submenu commands that are available include
 
✓ Automatically Suggest Photo Stacks: Select this command to make 
Elements search the photos in the Organizer window for visually similar 
appearances. Photos that have visually similar appearances are opened 
in a separate window, where you can select photos you want to stack. 
Make a selection of two or more photos, and select Stack Selected 
Photos.
 
✓ Stack Selected Photos: This command remains grayed out unless you 
have several photos selected to create a stack.
 
✓ Unstack Photos: Click a stack in the Organizer and choose this com-
mand to return all images to the Organizer window and eliminate the 
stack.
 
✓ Expand Photos in Stack: This command expands the stack to show all 
thumbnail images in the Organizer window.
 
✓ Collapse Photos in Stack: This command collapses a stack to show only 
the top photo in the Organizer window.
 
✓ Flatten Stack: After you stack some photos, this command becomes 
available.
 
 Be careful with this command. When you flatten a stack, all photos 
except for the top photo are deleted from the catalog (not from your 
hard disk).
 
✓ Remove Photo from Stack: Choosing this command removes the 
selected photos from the stack. 
Figure 6-10: An image thumbnail.

129
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
✓ Set as Top Photo: You also need to first choose Expand Photos in Stack 
before accessing this command. If you don’t like the topmost photo, 
select another and choose this menu command to move the selected 
photo to the top of the stack.
 
If you want to view all stacks in an Organizer window in expanded form, 
choose View➪Expand All Stacks. Using this command doesn’t require 
you to individually select stacks in the Organizer before expanding them.
Creating versions
Versions are similar to stacks, but you create versions from only one file. You 
can edit an image and save both the edited version and the original as a ver-
sion set. Additional edits can be made in either editing mode and saved to a 
version set. To create a version set, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an image by clicking it in the Organizer window.
 
2. Apply an edit.
 
 For example, right in the Organizer, you can correct some brightness 
problems in your image. Choose Edit➪Auto Smart Fix to adjust contrast 
and brightness. See Chapter 10 for more details on adjusting contrast 
and brightness.
 
3. View the items in the version set by clicking the image in the 
Organizer and choosing Edit➪Version Set➪Expand Items in 
Version Set.
 
 Elements automatically creates a version set for you when you apply 
the Auto Smart Fix to the file. A new Organizer window opens and shows 
two thumbnail images — one representing the original image and the 
other representing the edited version.
 
4. To open the original in Full Edit mode, select the original image 
and then select Full Edit from the Display drop-down menu on the 
Organizer Menu bar.
 
5. Edit the image in Full Edit mode.
 
 You can choose from many different menu commands to edit the image. 
For example, change the color mode to Indexed Color by choosing 
Image➪Mode➪Indexed Color, as we explain in Chapter 3.
 
6. Save a version by choosing File➪Save As.
 
7. In the Save Options area of the Save As dialog box, select the Include 
in the Organizer and Save in Version Set with Original check boxes.
 
8. Click Save.
 
 The edit made in Full Edit mode is saved as another version in your 
version set.

130
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
When you have a version set, you can open the Edit➪Version Set submenu 
and choose menu commands that are similar to commands available with 
stacks. (See the preceding section for details.)
After you create a version set, 
you find additional submenu 
commands you can use to 
manage the version set. Choose 
Edit➪Version Set, or open a 
context menu on a version set 
and then choose Version Set. 
The submenu, as shown in 
Figure 6-11, opens.
Items listed in the Version Set submenu include:
 
✓ Expand Items in Version Set: Click a version set and choose this menu 
command to expand the items in the version set.
 
✓ Collapse Items in Version Set: When items are expanded, you can 
return them to a collapsed view by selecting this command.
 
✓ Flatten Version Set: Be careful here. If you choose this command, you 
lose all items in the version set except the top image.
 
✓ Convert Version Set to Individual Items: This command removes items 
from the version set and adds each version as a separate image to the 
Organizer window.
 
✓ Revert to Original: This command deletes the version set and returns 
you to the original, unedited version of the file.
 
✓ Remove Item(s) from Version Set: As stated, this option removes an 
item from a version set.
 
✓ Set as Top Item: When viewing an expanded version set, click one of the 
images and choose this item to move it to the top.
Sticking Digital Notes on Your Photos
A way to identify your files beyond the tagging capabilities, which we discuss 
in the section “Organizing Groups of Images with Keyword Tags,” earlier in 
this chapter, is to add captions and notes. When you add a caption or note, 
you can search captions or notes by choosing the Find➪By Caption or Note 
menu command. Captions and notes are also helpful when you create dif-
ferent keyword tags — such as slide presentations and photo albums — by 
using the Create panel, as we explain in Chapter 16.
Figure 6-11: Use the Edit menu or a context menu 
opened on a version set, and then choose Version Set 
to open the submenu.

131
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Text captions are easy to create. 
Although you can select a thumbnail 
image in the Organizer window and 
choose Edit➪Add Caption, a better 
way is to use the Properties panel. 
Just follow these steps:
 
1. To open the Properties panel, 
select a thumbnail image in 
the Organizer, right-click it 
(Control-click on the Mac), and 
choose Show Properties from 
the context menu that appears.
 
 Alternatively, you can choose 
Window➪Properties or press 
Alt+Enter (Option+Return on 
the Mac). In either case, the 
Properties panel opens, as 
shown in Figure 6-12.
 
2. Type a caption by adding text to the Caption text box.
 
3. Type text in the Notes area on the panel to add a note.
 
 That’s all there is to it. You can also record audio notes about an image.
Automating Your Organization
If you have a number of common edits you want to make on a collection of 
photos, Elements lets you perform common changes to multiple files.
With a single menu command, you can change file formats, change file attri-
butes, and add common file base names. File renaming can be part of the 
Export command, or you can use a menu option for renaming files in the 
Organizer.
Automating common tasks when you export
You might use the Export Selected Items dialog box frequently when you’re 
acquiring images from digital cameras. What you may not know is that this 
dialog box can automate other common tasks, too:
 
✓ Add common base names for the filenames. (For example, change 
names, such as DSC000001, DSC000002, and so on, to more descriptive 
filenames, such as Dallas 001 and Dallas 002.)
 
✓ Change the file format.
 
✓ Change the file size and quality.

Par t II: Get ting Organized 
Follow these steps to use options in the Export dialog box:
 
1. Select files and open the Export New Items dialog box by choosing 
File➪Export➪As New File(s) or pressing Ctrl+E (Control+E on the Mac).
 
 The Export New Files dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 6-13.
 
 
Figure 6-13: The Export New Files dialog box permits you to 
 
rename and change formats for batches of files.
 
 You don’t have to select files beforehand. You can identify files in 
another dialog box that’s accessible from within the Export New Files 
dialog box. If you know ahead of time which files you want to export, go 
ahead and select them in the Organizer window.
 
2. Select a file type.
 
 From the File Type options, select the format you want to use for the 
exported images. For more information on file formats, see Chapter 3.
 
3. Select a size and quality.

133
 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
 
 If you select Use Original Format in Step 2, resizing options are grayed 
out. You use this setting when you want to retain the original sizes while 
you rename files. If you select JPEG, you can move the quality slider, as 
we explain in Chapter 3, to set the image quality of JPEG images. None of 
the other format options provides a quality option.
 
 For sizing images, select commands from the Photo Size drop-down 
list, where you find several fixed dimensions and an option for using a 
custom size.
 
4. Select a target location for the new files by clicking the Browse button 
and selecting a folder.
 
 If you want to create a new folder, you can click the Make New Folder 
button in the Browse for Folder dialog box, which opens after you click 
the Browse button.
 
5. If you want to keep the original filenames, click the Original Names

 Chapter 6: Organizing and Managing Your Photos
Renaming files
If you load an Organizer window and want to rename files, you don’t need 
to use the Export command and wade through the options in the Export 
Selected Files dialog box. Just select the files you want to rename and then 
choose File➪Rename. In the Rename dialog box that opens, type a base name 
for the files and click OK. The selected files are renamed using a common 
base name. You’ll find this a quick and easy way to rename those digital 
camera images.
Protecting Your Photos
Computer users often learn the hard way about the importance of backing up 
a hard drive and the precious data you spent time creating and editing. We 
can save you some aggravation right now, before you spend any more time 
editing your photos in Elements.
We authors are so paranoid when we’re writing a book that we back up our 
chapters on multiple drives, CDs, and DVDs when we finish them. The stan-
dard rule is that if you spend sufficient time working on a project and it gets 
to the point at which redoing your work would be a major aggravation, it’s 
time to back up files.
Backing up your catalog
When organizing your files, adding keyword tags and albums, and creating 
stacks and version sets, you want to back up the catalog file in case your 
catalog becomes corrupted.
Here’s how you can use Elements to create a backup of your data log:
 
1. Choose File➪Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive to open the 
Backup Catalog to CD/DVD or Hard Drive Wizard.
 
 This wizard has three panes that Elements walks you through to pain-
lessly create a backup of your files.
 
2. Select the source to back up.
 
 The first pane in the Burn/Backup Wizard offers two options:
 
• Full Backup: Click this radio button to perform your first backup or 
when you’re writing files to a new media source.
 
• Incremental Backup: Use this option if you’ve already performed at 
least one backup and you want to update the backed-up files.
 
3. Click Next and select a target location for your backed-up files.

136
Par t II: Get ting Organized 
 
 Active drives, including CD/DVD drives attached to your computer, 
appear in the Select Destination Drive list, as shown in Figure 6-15. Select a 
drive, and Elements automatically assesses the write speed and identifies 
a previous backup file if one was created. The total size of the files to copy 
is reported in the wizard. This information is helpful so that you know 
whether more than one CD or DVD is needed to complete the backup.
 
 
Figure 6-15: The wizard provides options for selecting the 
 
destination media for the backup.
 
4. If you intend to copy files to your hard drive or to another hard drive 
attached to your computer, click the Browse button and identify the 
path.
 
 If you use a media source, such as a CD or DVD, Elements prompts you 
to insert a disc and readies the media for writing.
 
5. Click Done, and the backup commences.
 
 Be certain to not interrupt the backup. It might take some time, so just let 
Elements work away until you’re notified that the backup is complete.
Backing up photos and files
With files stored all over your hard drive, manually copying files to a second 
hard drive, CD-ROM, or DVD would take quite a bit of time. Fortunately, 
Elements makes finding files to back up a breeze.
Choose File➪Make a CD/DVD, and then in the dialog box that opens, click 
Yes to confirm the action. The Make a CD/DVD dialog box then opens. Select 
a hard drive or a CD/DVD drive, type a name for the backup folder, and click 
OK. Elements goes about copying all files shown in the Organizer window to 
your backup source.

Selecting and 
Correcting Photos

In this part . . .
T
he wide array of editing features in Elements 
permit you to change, optimize, perfect, and 
combine images into composite designs. In this 
part, you can discover how to select image con-
tent and then alter that content for a variety of 
purposes, such as correcting the color, changing 
the appearance, and extracting the content so that 
you can introduce it in other photos. Because 
photos are composed of many thousands of tiny 
pixels, you need to develop some skill in selecting 
just the pixels you want to use for any given edit-
ing task.
In addition to describing how to create image 
selections, this part covers photo correction for 
image contrast and brightness, color correction, 
and color conversions from one color mode to 
another. Rarely do you encounter digital images 
that don’t require some kind of correction. In the 
chapters ahead, you can ﬁ nd out how to quickly 
master some powerful correction techniques.

f all you want to do is use your photos in all their unedited glory, feel free 
to skip this chapter and move on to other topics. But if you want to occa-
sionally pluck an element out of its environment and stick it in another, or 
apply an adjustment to just a portion of your image, this chapter’s for you.
Finding out how to make accurate selections is one of those 
skills that’s well worth the time you invest. In this chapter, 
we cover all the various selection tools and techniques. 
We give you tips on which tools are better for which 
kinds of selections. But remember that you usually 
have several ways to achieve the same result. Which 
road you choose is ultimately up to you.
Defining Selections
Before you dig in and get serious about selecting, 
let us clarify for the record what we mean by defining 
a selection. When you define a selection, you specify 
which part of an image you want to work with. Everything 
within a selection is considered selected. Everything out-
side the selection is unselected. After you have a selection, you 
can then adjust only that portion, and the unselected portion remains 
unchanged. Or, you can copy the selected area into another image altogether. 
Want to transport yourself out of your background and onto a white sandy

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
beach? Select yourself out of that backyard BBQ photo, get a stock photo of 
the tropical paradise of your choice, and drag and drop yourself onto your 
tropics photo with the Move tool. It’s that easy.
When you make a selection, a dotted outline — variously called a selec-
tion border, an outline, or a marquee — appears around the selected area. 
Elements, the sophisticated imaging program that it is, also allows you to 
partially select pixels, which allows for soft-edged selections. You create 
soft-edged selections by feathering or anti-aliasing the selection or by using a 
mask. Don’t worry: We cover these techniques in the section “Applying mar-
quee options,” later in this chapter.
 
For all the selection techniques described in this chapter, be sure that your 
image is in Full Edit mode in the Editor, and not in Quick Fix or Guided modes 
or in the Organizer.
Creating Rectangular and Elliptical Selections
If you can drag a mouse, you can master the Rectangular and Elliptical 
Marquee tools. These two tools are the easiest selection tools to use, so if 
your desired element is rectangular or elliptical, by all means, grab one of 
these tools.
The Rectangular Marquee tool, as its moniker states, is designed to define rect-
angular or square selections. This tool is great to use if you want to home in on 
the pertinent portion of your photo and eliminate unnecessary background.
Here’s how to make a selection with this tool:
 
1. Select the Rectangular Marquee tool from the Tools panel.
 
 It looks like a dotted square. You can also press M to access the tool.
 
2. Drag from one corner of the area you want to select to the opposite 
corner.
 
 While you drag, the selection border appears. The marquee follows the 
movement of your mouse cursor.
 
3. Release your mouse button.
 
 You now have a completed rectangular selection, as shown in Figure 7-1.
The Elliptical Marquee tool, which shares the same flyout menu as the 
Rectangular Marquee tool, is designed for elliptical or circular selections. 
This tool is perfect for selecting balloons, clocks, and other rotund elements.

141
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Here’s how to use the Elliptical 
Marquee:
 
1. Select the Elliptical Marquee 
tool from the Marquee flyout 
menu on the Tools panel.
 
 It looks like a dotted square. 
You can also press M to access 
this tool, if it’s visible. If it isn’t, 
press Shift+M.
 
2. Position the crosshair near the 
area you want to select and 
then drag around your desired 
element.
 
 With this tool, you drag from a 
given point on the ellipse. While 
you drag, the selection border 
appears.
 
3. When you’re satisfied with 
your selection, release the 
mouse button.
 
 Your elliptical selection is done, 
as shown in Figure 7-2. If your selection isn’t 
quite centered around your element, simply 
move the selection border by dragging 
inside the border.
 
You can move a selection while you’re making it 
with either of the Marquee tools by holding down 
the spacebar while you’re dragging.
Perfecting squares and circles 
with Shift and Alt/Option
Sometimes, you need to create a perfectly square 
or circular selection. To do so, simply press the 
Shift key after you begin dragging. After you make 
your selection, release the mouse button first and 
then release the Shift key.
When you’re making an elliptical selection, 
making the selection from the center outward is often easier. To draw from 
the center, first click the mouse button where you want to position the 
center, press Alt (Option on the Mac), and then drag. When you make your

to create rectangular selections.

selection, release the mouse button first and then release the Alt (Option on 
the Mac) key.
If you want to draw from the center outward and create a perfect circle or 
square, press the Shift key, as well. After you make your selection, release the 
mouse button and then release the Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) keys.
Applying marquee options
The Marquee tools offer additional options when you need to make precise 
selections at specific measurements. You also find options for making your 
selections soft around the edges.
 
The only thing to remember is that you must select the options on the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 7-3, before you make your selection with 
the Marquee tools. Options can’t be applied after the selection has already 
been made. The exception is that you can feather a selection after the fact by 
choosing Select➪Feather.
 
 
Figure 7-3: Apply marquee settings in the Options bar.
Here are the various marquee options available to you:
 
✓ Feather: Feathering creates soft edges around your selection. The 
amount of softness depends on the value, from 0 to 250 pixels, you 
enter. The higher the value, the softer the edges, as shown in Figure 
7-4. Very small amounts of feathering can be used to create subtle 
transitions between selected elements in a collage or for blending an 
element into an existing background. Larger amounts are often used 
when you’re combining multiple layers so that one image gradually 
fades into another. If you want a selected element to have just a soft 
edge without the background, simply choose Select➪Inverse and delete 
the background. See more on inversing selections in the “Modifying 
Your Selections” section, later in this chapter. For more on layers, see 
Chapter 8.
 
 Don’t forget that those soft edges represent partially selected pixels.
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Anti-aliasing barely softens the edge of an elliptical or irregu-
larly shaped selection so that the jagged edges aren’t quite so obvious. 
An anti-aliased edge is always only 1 pixel wide. We recommend leaving 
this option checked for your selections. It can help to create natural 
transitions between multiple selections when you’re creating collages.

✓ Mode: The Mode drop-down list contains three settings:
 
• Normal: The default setting, which allows you to freely drag a 
selection of any size.
 
• Fixed Aspect Ratio: Lets you specify a fixed ratio of width to height. 
For example, if you enter 3 for width and 1 for height, you get a 
selection that’s three times as wide as it is high, no matter what 
the size.
 
• Fixed Size: Lets you specify desired values for the width and 
height. This setting can be useful when you need to make several 
selections that must be the same size.
 
✓ Width and Height: When you select Fixed Aspect Ratio or Fixed Size 
from the Mode drop-down list, you must also enter your desired values 
in the Width and Height text boxes. To swap the Width and Height values, 
click the double-headed arrow button between the two measurements.

144
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 The default unit of measurement in the Width and Height text boxes 
is pixels (px), but that doesn’t mean that you’re stuck with it. You can 
enter any unit of measurement that Elements recognizes — pixels, 
inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm), points (pt), picas 
(pica), or percentages (%). Type your value and then type the word or 
abbreviation of your unit of measurement.
Making Freeform Selections with the Lasso Tools
As we all know, you can’t select everything with a rectangle or an ellipse. Life 
is just way too freeform for that. Most animate, and many inanimate, objects 
have undulations of varying sorts. Luckily, Elements anticipated the need to 
capture these and provided the Lasso tools.
The Lasso tools enable you to make any freehand selection you can think of. 
Elements generously provides three types of lasso tools:
 
✓ Lasso
 
✓ Polygonal
 
✓ Magnetic
Although all three tools are designed to make freeform selections, they differ 
slightly in their methodology, as we explain in the sections that follow.
To use these tools, all that’s really required is a steady hand. You’ll find that 
the more you use the Lasso tools, the better you become at your tracing 
technique. Don’t worry if your initial lasso selection isn’t super accurate. You 
can always go back and make corrections by adding and deleting from your 
selection. To find out how, see the section “Modifying Your Selections,” later 
in this chapter.
 
If you find that you really love the Lasso tools, you may want to invest in a 
digital drawing tablet and stylus. This device makes tracing, and also draw-
ing and painting, on the computer more comfortable. It better mimics pen 
and paper, and many users swear that they’ll never go back to a mouse after 
trying it out.
Selecting with the Lasso tool
Using the Lasso tool is the digital version of tracing an outline around an 
object on a piece of paper. It’s that easy. And you have only three choices 
on the Options bar — Feather, Anti-Alias, and Refine Edge. To find out more 
about Feather and Anti-Alias, see the section “Applying marquee options,” 
earlier in this chapter. For the scoop on Refine Edge, see the section 
“Wielding the wand to select,” later in this chapter.

145
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Here’s how to make a selection with the Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 It’s the tool that looks like a rope. You can also just press the L key. If 
the Lasso tool isn’t visible, press Shift+L to cycle through the various 
Lasso flavors.
 
2. Position the cursor anywhere along the edge of the object you want to 
select.
 
 The leading point of the cursor is the protruding end of the rope, as 
shown in Figure 7-5. Don’t be afraid to zoom in to your object if you need 
to see the edge more distinctly. In this figure, we started at the upper-
left corner of the butterfly’s wing.
 
3. Hold down the mouse button and trace around your desired object.
 
 Try to include only what you want to select.
 
 While you trace around your object, an outline follows the mouse 
cursor.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 Try not to release the mouse button until you return to your starting 
point. When you release the mouse button, Elements assumes that 
you’re done and closes the selection from wherever you released the 
mouse button to your starting point, creating a straight line across your 
image.
 
4. Continue tracing around the object and return to your starting point; 
release the mouse button to close the selection.
 
 You see a selection border that matches your lasso line. Look for a small 
circle that appears next to your lasso cursor when you return to your 
starting point. This icon indicates that you are closing the selection at 
the proper spot.
Getting straight with the Polygonal Lasso tool
The Polygonal Lasso tool has a specific mission in life: to select any element 
whose sides are straight. Think pyramids, stairways, skyscrapers, barns — 
you get the idea. It also works a tad differently from the Lasso tool. You don’t 
drag around the element with the Polygonal Lasso. Instead, you click and 
release the mouse button at the corners of the element you’re selecting. The 
Polygonal Lasso tool acts like a stretchy rubber band.
Follow these steps to select with the Polygonal Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Polygonal Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you get the 
Polygonal Lasso tool.
 
2. Click and release at any point to start the Polygonal Lasso selection 
line.
 
 We usually start at a corner.
 
3. Move (don’t drag) the mouse and click at the next corner of the object. 
Continue clicking and moving to each corner of your element.
 
 Notice how the line stretches out from each point you click.
 
4. Return to your starting point and click to close the selection.
 
 Be on the lookout for a small circle that appears next to your lasso 
cursor when you return to your starting point. This circle is an indica-
tion that you’re indeed closing the selection at the right spot.
 
 Note that you can also double-click at any point, and Elements closes 
the selection from that point to the starting point.
 
 After you close the polygonal lasso line, a selection border should 
appear, as shown in Figure 7-6.

 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Snapping with the 
Magnetic Lasso tool
The third member of the Lasso team 
is the Magnetic Lasso. We aren’t 
huge fans of this Lasso tool, which 
sometimes can be hard to work with. 
But we show you how it works so 
that you can decide whether to use 
it. The Magnetic Lasso tool works by 
defining the areas of the most con-
trast in an image and then snapping 
to the edge between those areas, as 
though the edge has a magnetic pull.
 
You have the most success using 
the Magnetic Lasso tool on an image 
that has a well-defined foreground 
object and high contrast between 
that element and the background — 
for example, a dark mountain range 
against a light sky.
The Magnetic Lasso tool also has some unique settings, which you can adjust 
on the Options bar before you start selecting:
 
✓ Width: Determines how close to the edge (between 1 and 256 pixels) 
you have to move your mouse before the Magnetic Lasso tool snaps to 
that edge. Use a lower value if the edge has a lot of detail or if the con-
trast in the image is low. Use a higher value for high-contrast images or 
smoother edges.
 
✓ Edge Contrast: Specifies the percentage of contrast (from 1 percent to 
100 percent) that’s required before the Magnetic Lasso snaps to an edge. 
Use a higher percentage if your image has good contrast between your 
desired element and the background.
 
✓ Frequency: Specifies how many fastening points (from 1 to 100) to place 
on the selection line. The higher the value, the greater number of points. 
As a general rule, if the element you want to select has a smooth edge, 
keep the value low. If the edge has a lot of detail, try a higher value.
 
✓ Tablet Pressure (pen icon): If you’re the proud owner of a pressure-
sensitive drawing tablet, select this option to make an increase in stylus 
pressure cause the edge width to decrease.

Follow these steps to use the Magnetic Lasso tool:
 
1. Select the Magnetic Lasso tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the L key and then press Shift+L until you select the 
Magnetic Lasso tool. The tool looks like a straight-sided lasso with a 
little magnet on it.
 
2. Click the edge of the object you want to select to place the first fasten-
ing point.
 
 Fastening points anchor the selection line, as shown in Figure 7-7. You 
can start anywhere; just be sure to click the edge between the element 
you want and the background you don’t want.

points to anchor the selection.
 
3. Continue to move your cursor around the object, without clicking.
 
 While the selection line gets pinned down with fastening points, only the 
newest portion of the selection line remains active.
 
 If the Magnetic Lasso tool starts veering off the desired edge of your 
object, back up your mouse and click to force down a fastening point. 
Conversely, if the Magnetic Lasso tool adds a fastening point where you 
don’t want one, press your Backspace (Delete on the Mac) key to delete it.

149
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
 If the Magnetic Lasso isn’t cooperating, you can temporarily switch to 
the other Lasso tools. To select the Lasso tool, hold down Alt (Option 
on the Mac) and then click the mouse button and drag. To select the 
Polygonal Lasso tool, hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and click.
 
4. Return to your starting point and click the mouse button to close the 
selection.
 
 You see a small circle next to your cursor, indicating that you’re at the 
right spot to close the selection. You can also double-click, whereby 
Elements closes the selection from where you double-clicked to your 
starting point. The selection border appears when the selection is 
closed.
Working Wizardry with the Magic Wand
The Magic Wand tool is one of the oldest tools in the world of digital imaging. 
This beloved tool has been around since both Photoshop and Elements were 
in their infancies. It’s extremely easy to use, but a little harder to predict 
what selection results it will present.
Here’s how it works: You click inside the image, and the Magic Wand tool 
makes a selection. This selection is based on the color of the pixel you 
clicked. If other pixels are similar in color to your target pixel, Elements 
includes them in the selection. What’s sometimes hard to predict, however, 
is how to determine how similar the color has to be to get the Magic Wand 
tool to select it. Fortunately, that’s where the Tolerance setting comes in. 
In the sections that follow, we first introduce you to this setting and then 
explain how to put the Magic Wand to work.
Talking about tolerance
The Tolerance setting determines the range of color that the Magic Wand 
tool selects. It’s based on brightness levels that range from 0 to 255:
 
✓ Setting the Tolerance to 0 selects one color only.
 
✓ Setting the Tolerance to 255 selects all colors or the whole image.
The default setting is 32, so whenever you click a pixel, Elements analyzes the 
value of that base color and then selects all pixels whose brightness levels 
are between 16 levels lighter and 16 levels darker.
What if an image contains a few shades of the same color? It’s not a huge 
problem. You can make multiple clicks of the Magic Wand to pick up addi-
tional pixels that you want to include in the selection. You can find out how 
in the section “Modifying Your Selections,” later in this chapter. Or, you can 

150
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
try a higher Tolerance setting. Conversely, if your wand selects too much, 
you can also lower your Tolerance setting.
 
So, you can see by our talk on tolerance that the Magic Wand tool works 
best when you have high-contrast images or images with a limited number 
of colors. For example, the optimum image for the Wand would be a solid 
black object on a white background. Skip the wand if the image has a ton of 
colors and no real definitive contrast between your desired element and the 
background.
Wielding the wand to select
To use the Magic Wand tool to adjust Tolerance settings, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Magic Wand tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can’t miss it. It looks like a wand with a starburst on the end. You 
can also just press W.
 
2. Click anywhere on your desired element, using the default Tolerance 
setting of 32.
 
 Remember that the pixel you 
click determines the base color.
 
 If the pixel gods are with you 
and you selected everything 
you want on the first click, 
you’re done. If your selection 
needs further tweaking, like the 
top image shown in Figure 7-8, 
continue to Step 3.
 
3. Specify a new Tolerance set-
ting on the Options bar.
 
 If the Magic Wand selects 
more than you want, lower the 
Tolerance setting. If the wand 
didn’t select enough, increase 
the value. While you’re poking 
around the Options bar, here 
are a couple more options to 
get familiar with:
 
• Anti-Alias: Softens the 
edge of the selection by 
one row of pixels. See the 
section “Applying mar-
quee options,” earlier in 
this chapter, for details.

Tolerance 80

based on a specified Tolerance setting.

151
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
• Contiguous: Forces the Magic Wand to select only pixels that are 
adjacent to each other. Without this option, the tool selects all 
pixels within the range of tolerance, whether or not they’re adja-
cent to each other.
 
• All Layers: If you have multiple layers and enable this option, the 
Magic Wand selects pixels from all visible layers. Without this 
option, the tool selects pixels from the active layer only. For more 
on layers, see Chapter 8.
 
• Refine Edge: Clean up your selection by moving the Smooth 
slider to reduce the amount of jagginess in your edges. Feather 
works like the feather option discussed in the “Applying marquee 
options” section, earlier in the chapter. Move the Contract/Expand 
slider to the left or right to decrease or increase the selected area, 
respectively. Click the custom overlay color button to preview 
your selection with your edges hidden and an overlay of screen-
only color in your unselected area. For more details, see the sec-
tion “Refining the edges of a selection,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Click your desired element again.
 
 Unfortunately, the Magic Wand tool isn’t magical enough to modify your 
first selection automatically. Instead, it deselects the current selection 
and makes a new selection based on your new Tolerance setting. If it 
still isn’t right, you can adjust the Tolerance setting again. Try, try again.
Modifying Your Selections
It’s time for a seventh-inning stretch in this chapter on selection tools. In this 
section, you can find out how to refine that Marquee, Lasso, or Magic Wand 
selection to perfection. Although these tools do an okay job of capturing the 
bulk of your selection, if you take the time to add or subtract a bit from your 
selection border, you can ensure that you get only what you really want.
 
You’re not limited to the manual methods described in the following sec-
tions, or even to keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the four selection 
option buttons on the left side of the Options bar to create a new selection 
(the default), add to a selection, subtract from a selection, or intersect one 
selection with another. Just choose your desired selection tool, click the 
selection option button you want, and drag (or click if you’re using the Magic 
Wand or Polygonal Lasso tool). The Add to Selection and Subtract from 
Selection buttons are also available when you’re using the Selection Brush. 
When you’re adding to a selection, a small plus sign (+) appears next to your 
cursor. When you’re subtracting from a selection, a small minus sign (–) 
appears. When you’re intersecting two selections, a small multiplication sign 
(×) appears.

Adding to a selection
If your selection doesn’t quite contain all the elements you want to capture, 
you need to add those portions to your current selection border. To add to 
a current selection, simply press the Shift key and drag around the area you 
want to include. If you’re using the Polygonal Lasso, click around the area. 
And, if you’re wielding the Magic Wand, just press the Shift key and click the 
area you want.
 
You don’t have to use the same tool to add to your selection that you used 
to create the original selection. Feel free to use whatever selection tool you 
think can get the job done. For example, it’s very common to start off with 
the Magic Wand and fine-tune with the Lasso tool.
Subtracting from a selection
Got too much? To subtract from a current selection, press the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key and drag around the pixels you want to subtract. With the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key, use the same method for the Magic Wand and 
Polygonal Lasso as you do for adding to a selection.
Intersecting two selections
Get your fingers in shape. To intersect your existing selection with a second 
selection, press Shift+Alt (Shift+Option on the Mac) and drag with the Lasso 
tool. Or, if you’re using the Magic Wand or Polygonal Lasso, press those keys 
and click rather than drag.
Avoiding key collisions
If you read the beginning of this chapter, you found out that by pressing the 
Shift key, you get a perfectly square or circular selection. We told you in the 
section “Adding to a selection,” earlier in this chapter, that if you want to add 
to a selection, you press the Shift key. What if you want to create a perfect 
square while adding to the selection? Or, what if you want to delete part of 
a selection while also drawing from the center outward? Both require the 
use of the Alt (Option on the Mac) key. How in the heck does Elements know 
what you want? Here are a few tips to avoid keyboard collisions — grab your 
desired Marquee tool:
 
✓ To add a square or circular selection, press Shift and drag. While you 
drag, keep the mouse button pressed, release the Shift key for just a 
second, and then press it again. Your added selection area suddenly 
snaps into a square or circle. You must then release the mouse button 
first and then release the Shift key.

153
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
✓ To delete from an existing selection while drawing from the center 
outward, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and drag. While you drag, keep 
the mouse button pressed, release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key for 
just a second, and then press it down again. You’re now drawing from 
the center outward. Again, release the mouse button first and then 
release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
Painting with the Selection Brush
If you like the organic feel of painting on a canvas, you’ll appreciate the 
Selection Brush. Using two different modes, you can either paint over areas 
of an image that you want to select or paint over areas you don’t want to 
select. This great tool also lets you make a basic, rudimentary selection with 
another tool, such as the Lasso, and then fine-tune the selection by brushing 
additional pixels into or out of the selection.
Here’s the step-by-step process of selecting with the Selection Brush:
 
1. Select the Selection Brush from the Tools panel.
 
 Or, simply press the A key. Press Shift+A if the Quick Selection tool is 
visible.
 
 This tool works in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode.
 
2. Specify your Selection Brush options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s the rundown on each option:
 
• Brush Presets: Choose a brush from the presets drop-down panel. 
To load additional brushes, click the downward-pointing arrow to 
the left of Default Brushes and choose the preset library of your 
choice. You can select the Load Brushes command from the panel 
pop-up menu.
 
• Brush Size: Specify a brush size, from 1 to 2500 pixels. Enter the 
value or drag the slider.
 
• Mode: Choose between Selection and Mask. Choose Selection to 
add to your selection and choose Mask to subtract from your 
selection. If you choose Mask mode, you must choose some addi-
tional overlay options. An overlay is a layer of color (that shows 
onscreen only) that hovers over your image, indicating protected 
or unselected areas. You must also choose an overlay opacity 
between 1 and 100 percent (which we describe in a Tip paragraph 
at the end of this section). You can also change the overlay color 
from the default red to another color. This option can be helpful if 
your image contains a lot of red.
 
• Hardness: Set the hardness of the brush tip, from 1 to 100 percent.

154
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
3. If your mode is set to Selection, paint over the areas you want to 
select.
 
 You see a selection border. Each stroke adds to the selection. If you 
inadvertently add something you don’t want, simply press the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key and paint over the undesired area. After you 
finish painting what you want, your selection is ready to go.
 
4. If your mode is set to Mask, paint over the areas that you don’t want 
to select.
 
 This mode does the opposite of Selection mode. When you’re done 
painting your mask, choose Selection from the Mode drop-down list, or 
simply choose another tool from the Tools panel, in order to convert 
your mask into a selection border.
 
 While you paint, you see the color of your overlay. Each stroke adds more 
to the overlay area, as shown in Figure 7-9. When working in Mask mode, 
you’re essentially covering up, or masking, the areas you want to protect 
from manipulation. That manipulation can be selecting, adjusting color, 
or performing any other Elements command. Again, if you want to remove 
parts of the masked area, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and paint.

155
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
 
 If you painted your selection in Mask mode, your selection border is 
around what you don’t want. To switch to what you do want, choose 
Select➪Inverse.
 
 Which mode should you choose? Well, it’s up to you. But one advantage 
to working in Mask mode is that you can partially select areas. By paint-
ing with soft brushes, you create soft-edged selections. These soft edges 
result in partially selected pixels. If you set the overlay opacity to a 
lower percentage, your pixels are even less opaque, or “less selected.” If 
this partially selected business sounds vaguely familiar, it’s because this 
is also what happens when you feather selections, as we discuss in the 
section “Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chapter.
Painting with the Quick Selection Brush
Think of the Quick Selection Brush as a combination Brush, Magic Wand, and 
Lasso tool. Good news — it lives up to its “quick” moniker. Better news — it’s 
also easy to use. The best news? It gives decent results, so give it a whirl.
Here’s how to make short work of selecting with this tool:
 
1. Select the Quick Selection tool from the Tools panel.
 
 The tool looks like a wand with a marquee around the end. It shares the 
same flyout menu with the Selection Brush tool. You can also press the 
A key. Press Shift+A if the Selection Brush is visible.
 
 This tool works in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode.
 
2. Specify the options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s a description of the options:
 
• New Selection: The default option enables you to create a new 
selection. There are also options to add to and subtract from your 
selection.
 
• Brush Picker: Choose your desired brush settings. Specify the diam-
eter, from 1 to 2500 pixels. You can also specify hardness, spacing, 
angle, and roundness settings. For details on these settings, see 
Chapter 12.
 
• All Layers: If your image has layers and you want to make a selec-
tion from all the layers, select this option. If you leave it unse-
lected, you will select only from the current layer.
 
• Auto-Enhance: Check this option to have Elements automatically 
refine your selection by implementing an algorithm.
 
3. Drag, or paint, the desired areas of your image.

156
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 Your selection grows as you 
drag, as shown in Figure 7-10. If 
you stop dragging and click in 
another portion of your image, 
your selection includes that 
clicked area.
 
4. Add to or delete from your 
selection, as desired:
 
• To add to your selection: 
Press the Shift key while 
dragging across your 
desired image areas.
 
• To delete from your selec-
tion: Press the Alt (Option 
on the Mac) key while 
dragging across your 
unwanted image areas.
 
 You can also select the Add to 
Selection and Subtract from 
Selection options in the 
Options bar.
 
5. If you need to fine-tune your 
selection, click the Refine Edge 
option in the Options bar and 
then change the settings, as 
desired.
 
 The settings are explained in detail in the “Refining the edges of a selec-
tion” section, later in this chapter.
 
 Note that if your object is fairly detailed, you may even need to break 
out the Lasso or another selection tool to make some final cleanups. 
Eventually, you should arrive at a selection you’re happy with.
Working with the Cookie Cutter Tool
The Cookie Cutter tool is a cute name for a pretty powerful tool. You can 
think of it as a Custom Shape tool for images. But, although the Custom 
Shape tool creates a mask and just hides everything outside the shape, the 
Cookie Cutter cuts away everything outside the shape. The preset libraries 
offer you a large variety of interesting shapes, from talk bubbles to Swiss 
cheese. (We’re not being funny here — check out the food library.)
www.istockphoto.com
Figure 7-10: Paint a selection with the Quick 
Selection tool.

157
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Here’s the lowdown on using the Cookie Cutter:
 
1. Choose the Cookie Cutter tool from the Tools panel.
 
 There’s no missing it; it looks like a star. You can also press the Q key.
 
2. Specify your options on the Options bar.
 
 Here’s the list:
 
• Shape: Choose a shape from the preset library. To load other 
libraries, click the panel pop-up menu and choose one from the 
submenu.
 
• Shape Options: These options let you draw your shape with certain 
parameters:
 
 Unconstrained: Enables you to draw freely.
 
 Defined Proportions: Enables you to keep the height and width 
proportional.
 
 Defined Size: Crops the image to the original, fixed size of the 
shape you choose. You can’t make it bigger or smaller.
 
 Fixed Size: Allows you to enter your desired width and height.
 
 From Center: Allows you to draw the shape from the center 
outward.
 
• Feather: This option creates a soft-edged selection. See the sec-
tion “Applying marquee options,” earlier in this chapter, for more 
details.
 
• Crop: Click this option to crop the image into the shape. The shape 
will fill the image window.
 
3. Drag your mouse on the image to create your desired shape, size 
the shape by dragging one of the handles of the bounding box, and 
position the shape by placing the mouse cursor inside the box and 
dragging.
 
 You can also perform other types of transformations, such as rotating 
and skewing. For more on transformations, see Chapter 9.
 
4. Click the Commit button on the Options bar or press Enter to finish 
the cutout.
 
 See Figure 7-11 to see my image cut into an elephant shape. If you want 
to bail out of the bounding box and not cut out, you can always press 
the Cancel button on the Options bar or press Esc.

Eliminating with the Eraser Tools
The Eraser tools let you erase areas of your image. Elements has three eraser 
tools: the regular Eraser, the Magic Eraser, and the Background Eraser. The 
Eraser tools look like those pink erasers you used in grade school, so you 
can’t miss them. If you can’t locate them, you can always press E and then 
Shift+E to toggle through the three tools.
 
When you erase pixels, those pixels are history — they’re gone. So, before 
using the Eraser tools, you should probably have a backup of your image 
stored somewhere. Think of it as a cheap insurance policy in case things 
go awry.
The Eraser tool
The Eraser tool enables you to erase areas on your image to either your back-
ground color or, if you’re working on a layer, a transparent background, as 
shown in Figure 7-12. For more on layers, check out Chapter 8.

159
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
To use this tool, simply select it 
and drag through the desired area 
on your image, and you’re done. 
Because it isn’t the most accurate 
tool on the planet, remember to 
zoom way in and use smaller brush 
tips to do some accurate erasing.
You have several Eraser options to 
specify on the Options bar:
 
✓ Brush Presets: Click the drop-
down panel to access the Brush 
presets. Choose the brush of 
your choice. Again, additional 
brush libraries are available in the Brushes pop-up menu.
 
✓ Size: Click the down-pointing arrow to access the Size slider. Choose a 
brush size between 1 and 2500 pixels.
 
✓ Mode: Select from Brush, Pencil, and Block. When you select Block, 
you’re stuck with one size (a 16-x-16-pixel tip) and can’t select other 
preset brushes.
 
✓ Opacity: Specify a percentage of transparency for your erased areas. 
The lower the Opacity setting, the less it erases. Opacity isn’t available 
in Block mode.
The Background Eraser tool
The Background Eraser tool, which is more savvy than the Eraser tool, erases 
the background from an image while being mindful of leaving the foreground 
untouched. The Background Eraser tool erases to transparency on a layer. 
If you drag an image with only a background, Elements converts the back-
ground into a layer.
 
The key to using the Background Eraser is to carefully keep the hot spot, the 
crosshair at the center of the brush, on the background pixels while you 
drag. The hot spot samples the color of the pixels and deletes that color 
whenever it falls inside the brush circumference. But, if you accidentally 
touch a foreground pixel with the hot spot, it’s erased as well. And the tool 
isn’t even sorry about it! This tool works better with images that have good 
contrast in color between the background and foreground objects, as shown 
in Figure 7-13. Also, if your image has very detailed or wispy edges (such as 
hair or fur), you’re better off using the Magic Extractor command, which we 
describe in the section “Using the Magic Extractor Command,” later in this 
chapter.
Here’s the rundown on the Background Eraser options:
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-12: Erase either to your background 
color (left) or to transparency (right).

160
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ Brush Preset Picker: This 
option provides settings to cus-
tomize the size and appearance 
of your brush tip. The Size and 
Tolerance settings at the bottom 
are for pressure-sensitive draw-
ing tablets.
 
✓ Limits: Discontiguous erases all 
similarly colored pixels wher-
ever they appear in the image. 
Contiguous erases all similarly 
colored pixels that are adjacent 
to those under the hot spot.
 
✓ Tolerance: Like the Magic 
Wand and the Magic Eraser, 
the Background Eraser uses a 
Tolerance setting. The percent-
age determines how similar the colors have to be to that of the color 
under the hot spot before Elements erases them. A higher value picks up 
more colors, whereas a lower value picks up fewer colors. See the sec-
tion “Talking about tolerance,” earlier in this chapter, for more details.
The Magic Eraser tool
You can think of the Magic Eraser tool as a combination Eraser and Magic 
Wand tool. It selects and erases similarly colored pixels simultaneously. 
Unless you’re working on a layer with the transparency locked (see Chapter 8 
for more on locking), the pixels are erased to transparency. If you’re working 
on an image with just a background, Elements converts the background into 
a layer.
The Magic Eraser shares most of the same options with the other erasers. 
Here are the unique options:
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Creates a slightly soft edge around the transparent area.
 
✓ All Layers: Samples colors using data from all visible layers but erases 
pixels on the active layer only.
Using the Magic Extractor Command
The last selection tool in the Elements repertoire is the Magic Extractor com-
mand. This command enables you to make selections based on your identi-
fication of the foreground and background portions of your image. The way 
this tool works is you specify your foreground and background by simply 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-13: The Background Eraser erases 
similarly colored pixels sampled by the hot 
spot of your brush cursor.

161
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
clicking these areas with the brush tool and “marking” them. Click the magic 
OK button, and your object or objects are neatly and painlessly extracted.
 
Although it isn’t mandatory, you can make a rough selection first before 
selecting the Magic Extractor command. This technique obviously restricts 
what’s extracted and can result in a more accurate selection.
Follow these steps to magically extract your element:
 
1. Choose Image➪Magic Extractor.
 
 The huge Magic Extractor dialog box appears.
 
2. Grab the Foreground Brush tool, and click or drag to mark your fore-
ground areas — or the areas you want to select.
 
 The default color of the Foreground Brush is red, as shown in Figure 7-14.
 
 Like with the Selection brush, the more accurate the data you provide 
to the command’s algorithm, the more accurate your extraction. Be sure 
to use the Zoom and Hand tools to help magnify and move around your 
image, as needed. For more on these tools, see Chapter 5.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 You can also change the size of your brush tip (from 1 to 100 pixels) in 
the Tool Options area on the right side of the dialog box. If necessary, 
change the color of your foreground and background colors by clicking 
the swatch and choosing a new color from the Color Picker.
 
3. Select the Background Brush tool, and click or drag to mark the back-
ground area or the portions you don’t want to select.
 
 The default color of the Background Brush is blue.
 
4. Click Preview to view your extraction.
 
 Elements churns for a few seconds before presenting you with a look 
at your extraction. You can change the preview by choosing either 
Selection Area or Original Photo from the Display pop-up list.
 
 If you want to see your selection against a different background, choose 
one, such as black matte for a black background, from the Background 
pop-up list.
 
5. If you aren’t happy with the preview of your selection, you can refine 
the selection:
 
• To erase any markings: Select the Point Eraser tool, and click or 
drag over the offending areas.
 
• To add areas to the selection: Click or drag over your desired areas 
with the Add to Selection tool.
 
• To delete areas from the selection: Drag with the Remove from 
Selection tool.
 
• To smooth the edges of your foreground selection: Drag over the 
edges with the Smoothing Brush tool.
 
• To soften the edges of your selection: Enter a value in the Feather 
box. Remember: The higher the value, the softer the edge.
 
• To fill a hole: Click the aptly named Fill Holes button.
 
• To remove the halo of pixels between the foreground and background 
areas: Click Defringe. Enter a value in the Defringe Width box.
 
 If things start to get messy, you can always start over by clicking Reset 
at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
6. When you’re pleased with the results, click OK to finish the selection 
process and close the Magic Extractor dialog box.
 
 Your newly extracted image appears as a new file, as shown in Figure 7-15.

163
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
Using the Select Menu
In the following sections, we breeze 
through the Select menu. Along 
with the methods we describe in 
the “Modifying Your Selections” 
section, earlier in this chapter, you 
can use this menu to further modify 
selections by expanding, contract-
ing, smoothing, softening, inversing, 
growing, and grabbing similarly 
colored pixels. If that doesn’t satisfy 
your selection needs, nothing will.
Selecting all or nothing
The Select All and Deselect com-
mands are no-brainers. To select 
everything in your image, choose 
Select➪All or press Ctrl+A (Ô+A on 
the Mac). To deselect everything, 
choose Select➪Deselect or press 
Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac). Remember 
that you usually don’t have to Select 
All. If you don’t have a selection 
border in your image, Elements 
assumes that the whole image is 
fair game for any manipulation.
Reselecting a selection
If you sacrifice that second cup of coffee to steady your hand and take the 
time to carefully lasso around your desired object, you don’t want to lose 
your selection before you have a chance to perform your next move. But 
all it takes is a mere inadvertent click of your mouse while you have an 
active selection border to obliterate your selection. Fortunately, Elements 
anticipated such a circumstance and offers a solution. If you choose 
Select➪Reselect, Elements retrieves your last selection.
 
One caveat: The Reselect command works only for the last selection you 
made, so don’t plan to reselect a selection you made last Tuesday or even 
just five minutes ago, if you selected something else after that selection. If 
you want to reuse a selection for the long term, you need to save it, as we 
explain in the section “Saving and loading selections,” later in this chapter.

Extractor.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Inversing a selection
You know the old song lyric: “If you can’t be with the one you love, love 
the one you’re with.” Well, Elements is kind of like that. Sometimes, it’s just 
easier to select what you don’t want rather than what you do want. For 
example, if you’re trying to select your beloved in his or her senior photo, it’s 
probably easier to just click the studio backdrop with the Magic Wand and 
then inverse the selection by choosing Select➪Inverse.
Feathering a selection
In the “Applying marquee options” section, earlier in this chapter, we describe 
how to feather a selection when using the Lasso and Marquee tools by 
entering a value in the Feather box on the Options bar. Remember that this 
method of feathering requires that you set the Feather value before you 
create your selection. What we didn’t tell you is that there’s a way to apply a 
feather after you make a selection.
Choose Select➪Feather and enter your desired amount from .2 to 250 pixels. 
Your selection is subsequently softened around the edges.
 
This method is actually a better way to go. Make your selection and fine-tune 
it by using the methods we describe earlier in this chapter. Then, apply your 
feather. The problem with applying the feather before you make a selection 
happens when you want to modify your initial selection. When you make a 
selection with a feather, the marquee outline of the selection adjusts to take 
into account the amount of the feather. So, the resulting marquee outline 
doesn’t resemble your precise mouse movement, making it harder to modify 
that selection.
Refining the edges of a selection
This Refine Edge option enables you to fine-tune the edges of your selection. 
It doesn’t matter how you got the selection, just that you have one. You can 
find the command in the Options bar of the Magic Wand, Lasso, and Quick 
Selection tools. And, of course, you can find it in the Select menu. Here’s the 
scoop on each of the settings in this option:
 
✓ Smooth: Reduces the amount of jaggedness along your selection edges.
 
✓ Feather: Moves the slider to create an increasingly softer, more blurred 
edge.
 
✓ Contract/Expand: Decreases or increases the selected area. The con-
tract and expand features are discussed in more detail in the later sec-
tion “Using the Modify commands.”
 
✓ Background icons: Enables you to preview your selection in Standard 
or Overlay mode. Click the custom overlay color button to preview your 

165
 Chapter 7: Making and Modifying Selections
selection with your edges hidden and a semi-opaque layer of color (that 
shows onscreen only) in your unselected area. Double-click this icon to 
change the color and opacity of the overlay. Press F to cycle between 
standard and overlay views. And press X to hide your selection edges.
 
✓ Zoom tool: Allows you to zoom in to your image to see the effects of 
your settings.
 
✓ Hand tool: Enables you to pan around your image window to see the 
effects of your settings.
Using the Modify commands
Although the commands on the Modify submenu definitely won’t win any 
popularity contests, they may occasionally come in handy. Here’s the scoop 
on each command:
 
✓ Border: Selects the area, from 1 
to 200 pixels, around the edge of 
the selection border. By choos-
ing Edit➪Fill Selection, you can 
fill the border with color, as 
shown in Figure 7-16.
 
✓ Smooth: Rounds off any jagged, 
raggedy edges. Enter a value 
from 1 to 100 pixels, and 
Elements looks at each selected 
pixel and then includes or dese-
lects the pixels in your selection 
based on your chosen value. 
Start with a low number, like 1, 
2, or 3 pixels. Otherwise, it may 
make your selection worse.
 
✓ Expand: Enables you to increase the size of your selection by a given 
number of pixels, from 1 to 100. This command is especially useful if you 
just barely missed getting the edge of an elliptical selection and need it 
to be a little larger.
 
✓ Contract: Decreases your selection border by 1 to 100 pixels. When 
you’re compositing multiple images, you often benefit by slightly con-
tracting your selection if you plan on applying a feather. That way, you 
avoid picking up a fringe of background pixels around your selection.
Applying the Grow and Similar commands
The Grow and Similar commands are often used in tandem with the Magic Wand 
tool. If you made an initial selection with the Magic Wand but didn’t quite get 
everything you want, try choosing Select➪Grow. The Grow command increases 
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 7-16: Fill a border with color to create a 
stroke around your object.

166
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
the size of the selection by including adjacent pixels that fall within the range 
of tolerance. The Similar command is like Grow except that the pixels don’t 
have to be adjacent to be selected. The command searches throughout the 
image and picks up pixels within the tolerance range.
These commands don’t have their own tolerance options. They use whatever 
Tolerance value is displayed on the Options bar when the Magic Wand tool 
is selected. You can adjust that Tolerance setting to include more or fewer 
colors.
Saving and loading selections
There may be times when you toil so long over a complex selection that you 
really want to save it for future use. Saving it isn’t only possible, but also 
highly recommended. It’s also a piece a cake. Here’s how:
 
1. After you perfect your selec-
tion, choose Select➪Save 
Selection.
 
2. In the Save Selection dialog 
box, leave the Selection option 
set to New and enter a name 
for your selection, as shown in 
Figure 7-17.
 
 The operation is automatically 
set to New Selection.
 
3. Click OK.
 
4. When you want to access the 
selection again, choose Select➪Load Selection and choose a selection 
from the Selection drop-down list.
 
 To inverse your selection, click the Invert box. Notice that you now 
have available options to add to, subtract from, or intersect with your 
selection. These options can come in handy if you want to modify your 
existing selection. For example, you may select the center and petals of 
a flower, but not the stem and leaves. You later decide that you really 
need the whole flower. Rather than make a whole new selection, you can 
select just the stem and leaves and then choose Add to Selection, and 
you have your whole flower. If you want, you can then save the flower as 
a new selection for later use.
Figure 7-17: Save your selection for later use to 
save time and effort.

U
sing Elements without ever using layers would be like typing a book on 
an old IBM Selectric typewriter: Sure, you could do it, but it wouldn’t 
be fun. An even bigger issue would occur when it came time to edit that book 
and make changes. Correction tape, Wite-Out, and erasers would 
make that task downright tedious, not to mention messy. The 
benefit of using layers is that you have tremendous flexibil-
ity. You can quickly make as many edits as you want for 
as long as you want, as long as you keep your compos-
ite image in layers. Layers make working in Elements 
a lot more productive. Don’t give a darn about pro-
ductivity? Well, let’s just say that layers also make 
it a breeze for you to dabble in your more artsy 
side. This chapter gives you everything you need 
to know about layers. After you try them out, you’ll 
wonder how you ever lived without them.
Getting to Know Layers
Think of layers as sheets of acetate or clear transparency film. 
You have drawings or photographs on individual sheets. What you 
place on each sheet doesn’t affect any of the other sheets. Any area on 
the sheet that doesn’t have an image on it is transparent. You can stack 
these sheets on top of the others to create a combined image, or composite 
(or collage, if you prefer). You can reshuffle the order of the sheets, add new 
sheets, and delete old sheets.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
In Elements, layers are essentially a digital version of these clear acetate 
sheets. You can place elements, such as images, type, or shapes on separate 
layers and create a composite, as shown in Figure 8-1. You can hide, add, 
delete, or rearrange layers. Because layers are digital, of course, they have 
some added functionality. You can adjust how opaque or transparent the 
element on the layer is. You can also add special effects and change how the 
colors interact between layers.
 
To work with layers, you must be in the Editor in Full Edit mode.

Figure 8-1: Layers enable you to easily create composite images.
When you create a new file with background contents of white or a back-
ground color, scan an image into Elements, or open a file from a CD or your 
digital camera, you basically have a file with just a background. There are no 
layers yet.
An image contains only one background, and you can’t do much to it besides 
paint on it and make basic adjustments. You can’t move the background or 
change its transparency or blend mode. How do you get around all these limi-
tations? Convert your background into a layer by following these easy steps:

169
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
1. Choose Window➪Layers to display the Layers panel.
 
 The Layers panel is explained in detail in the next section.
 
2. Double-click Background on the Layers panel.
 
 Or, choose Layer➪New➪Layer from Background.
 
3. Name the layer or leave it at the default name of Layer 0.
 
 You can also adjust the blend mode and opacity of the layer in the New 
Layer dialog box. You can also do it via the Layers panel commands 
later.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Elements converts your background into a layer, known also as an image 
layer.
 
 When you create a new image with transparent background contents, 
the image doesn’t contain a background but instead is created with a 
single layer.
Anatomy of a 
Layers panel
Elements keeps layers con-
trolled on their own panel 
named, not surprisingly, 
the Layers panel. To dis-
play the Layers panel, as 
shown in Figure 8-2, choose 
Window➪Layers in the 
Editor in Full Edit mode.
The order of the layers on 
the Layers panel represents 
the order in the image. We 
refer to this concept in the 
computer graphics world 
as the stacking order. The 
top layer on the panel is the 
top layer in your image, and 
so on. Depending on what 
you’re doing, you can work 
either on a single layer or on 
multiple layers at one time. 
Here are some tips for work-
ing with the Layers panel:
Create New Layer
Create Adjustment Layer
Delete Layer Lock All
Lock Transparent Pixels

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
✓ Select a layer. Click a layer name or its thumbnail. Elements highlights 
the active layer on the panel.
 
✓ Select multiple contiguous layers. Click your first layer and then Shift-
click your last layer.
 
✓ Select multiple noncontiguous layers. Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) 
your desired layers.
 
✓ View and hide layers. To hide a layer, click the eye icon for that layer 
so that the eye disappears. To redisplay the layer, click the blank space 
in the eye column. You can also hide all the layers except one by select-
ing your desired layer and Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on the Mac) 
the eye icon for that layer. Redisplay all layers by Alt-clicking (Option-
clicking on the Mac) the eye icon again. Hiding all the layers except the 
one you want to edit can be helpful in allowing you to focus without the 
distraction of all the other imagery.
 
 Only layers that are visible are printed. This can be useful if you want to 
have several versions of an image (each on a separate layer) for a proj-
ect within the same file.
 
✓ Select the actual element (the nontransparent pixels) on the layer. 
Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) the layer’s thumbnail (not the name) on 
the panel.
 
✓ Create a new blank layer. Click the Create New Layer icon at the top of 
the panel.
 
✓ Create an adjustment layer. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon at 
the top of the panel. Adjustment layers are special layers that modify 
contrast and color in your image. You can also add fill layers — layers 
containing color, gradients, or patterns — by using this command. 
We give you more details on adjustment and fill layers in the section 
“Working with Different Layer Types,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Duplicate an existing layer. Drag the layer to the Create New Layer icon 
at the top of the panel.
 
✓ Rearrange layers. To move a layer to another position in the stacking 
order, drag the layer up or down on the Layers panel. While you drag, 
you see a fist icon. Release the mouse button when a highlighted line 
appears where you want to insert the layer.
 
 If your image has a background, it always remains the bottommost layer. 
If you need to move the background, convert it to a layer by double-
clicking the name on the Layers panel. Enter a name for the layer and 
click OK.
 
✓ Rename a layer. When you create a new layer, Elements provides 
default layer names (Layer 1, Layer 2, and so on). If you want to rename 

171
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
a layer, double-click the layer name on the Layers panel and enter the 
name directly on the Layers panel.
 
✓ Adjust the interaction between colors on layers and adjust the trans-
parency of layers. You can use the blend modes and the opacity options 
at the top of the panel to mix the colors between layers and adjust the 
transparency of the layers, as shown in Figure 8-3.

Figure 8-3: We created this effect by using blend modes and opacity 
 
options.
 
✓ Link layers. Sometimes, you want your layers to stay grouped as a unit 
to make your editing tasks easier. If so, link your layers by selecting the 
layers on the panel and then clicking the Link Layers icon at the top of 
the panel. A link icon appears to the right of the layer name. To remove 
the link, click the Link Layers icon again.
 
✓ Lock layers. Select your desired layer and then click one of the two lock 
icons at the top of the panel. The checkerboard square icon locks all 
transparent areas of your layers. This lock prevents you from painting 
or editing any transparent areas on the layers. The lock icon locks your 
entire layer and prevents it from being changed in any way, including 
moving or transforming the elements on the layer. You can, however, 
still make selections on the layer. To unlock the layer, simply click the 
icon again to toggle off the lock.
 
 By default, the background is locked and can’t be unlocked until you 
convert the background into a layer by choosing Layer➪New➪Layer 
from Background.
 
✓ Delete a layer. Drag it to the trash can icon.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Using the Layer and Select menus
As with many features in Elements, you usually have more than one way to 
do something. This is especially true when it comes to working with layers. 
Besides the commands on the Layers panel, you have two layer menus — the 
Layers menu and the Select menu, both of which you can find on the main 
menu bar at the top of the application window.
The Layers menu
Much of what you can do with the Layers panel icons you can also do by 
using the Layer menu on the menu bar and the Layers panel pop-up menu 
connected to the Layers panel (click the More button in the upper-right 
corner). Commands, such as New, Duplicate, Delete, and Rename, are omni-
present throughout. But you find commands that are exclusive to the Layers 
panel, the main Layer menu, and the Layers pop-up menu, respectively. So, 
if you can’t find what you’re looking for in one area, just go to another. Some 
commands require an expanded explanation and are described in sections 
that follow. Here’s a quick description of most of the commands:
 
✓ Delete Linked Layers and Delete Hidden Layers: These commands 
delete only those layers that have been linked or hidden from display 
on the Layers panel.
 
✓ Layer Style: These commands manage the styles, or special effects, you 
apply to your layers.
 
✓ Change Layer Content: Depending on the type of layer you’ve selected, 
this command enables you to change or adjust the contents of your 
layer. For example, you can change the contents of a shape layer from a 
solid color into a pattern.
 
✓ Arrange: Enables you to shuffle your layer stacking order with com-
mands, such as Bring to Front and Send to Back. Reverse switches the 
order of your layers if you have two or more layers selected.
 
✓ Group with Previous and Ungroup: The Group command creates a clip-
ping group, in which a group of layers is constrained to the boundaries 
of a base layer. Find more details in the section “Adjustment layers,” 
later in this chapter.
 
✓ Type: The commands in the Type submenu control the display of type 
layers. For more on type, see Chapter 13.
 
✓ Rename Layer: Enables you to give a layer a new name. You can also 
simply double-click the name on the Layers panel.
 
✓ Simplify: This command converts a type layer, shape layer, or fill layer 
into a regular image layer. Briefly, a shape layer contains a vector object, 
and a fill layer contains a solid color, a gradient, or a pattern.

173
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
✓ Merge and Flatten: The various merge and flatten commands combine 
multiple layers into a single layer or, in the case of flattening, combine 
all your layers into a single background.
 
✓ Panel Options: You can select display options and choose to use a layer 
mask on your adjustment layers. Leave this option selected.
The Select menu
Although the Select menu’s main duties are to assist you in making and refin-
ing your selections, it offers a few handy layer commands, all of which are 
new additions to the menu. Here’s a quick introduction to each command:
 
✓ Select All Layers: Want to quickly get everything in your file? Choose 
Select➪All Layers.
 
✓ Select Layers of Similar Type: This command is helpful if you have dif-
ferent types of layers in your document, such as regular layers, type 
layers, shape layers, and adjustment layers, and you want to select just 
one type. Select one of your layers and then choose Select➪Similar 
Layers. For details on different types of layers, see the following section.
 
✓ Deselect All Layers: Choose Select➪Deselect Layers.
Working with Different Layer Types
Layer life exists beyond just converting an existing background into a layer, 
which we describe in the section “Getting to Know Layers,” earlier in this 
chapter. In fact, Elements offers five kinds of layers. You’ll probably spend 
most of your time creating image layers, but just so that you’re familiar with 
all types, the following sections describe each one.
Image layers
The image layer, usually just referred to as a layer, is the type of layer 
we’re referring to when we give the analogy of acetate sheets in the section 
“Getting to Know Layers,” earlier in this chapter. You can create blank layers 
and add images to them, or you can create layers from images themselves. 
You can have as many image layers as your computer’s memory allows. Just 
keep in mind that the more layers you have, the larger your file size and the 
slower your computer responds.
Each layer in an image can be edited without affecting the other layers. You 
can move, paint, size, or apply a filter, for example, without disturbing a single 
pixel on any other layer or on the background, for that matter. And, when an 
element is on a layer, you no longer have to make a selection to select it (see 
Chapter 7 for selection info). Just drag the element with the Move tool.

174
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
We tell you more about how to work with image layers in the section 
“Tackling Layer Basics,” later in this chapter.
Adjustment layers
An adjustment layer is a special kind 
of layer used for modifying color and 
contrast. The advantage of using 
adjustment layers for your correc-
tions, rather than applying them 
directly on the image layer, is that 
you can apply the corrections with-
out permanently affecting the pixels. 
They’re totally nondestructive. And, 
because the correction is on a layer, 
you can edit, or even delete, the 
adjustment at any time. Adjustment 
layers, as shown in Figure 8-4, apply 
the correction only to all the layers 
below them, without affecting any of 
the layers above them.
 
Another unique feature of adjust-
ment layers is that when you create 
one, you also create a layer mask 
on that layer at the same time. A 
layer mask is like a second sheet of 
acetate that hovers over the under-
lying layers. The layer mask allows 
you to selectively apply the adjust-
ment to the layers below it by apply-
ing shades of gray — from white to 
black — on the mask. For example, 
by default, the mask is completely 
white. This allows the adjustment to be fully applied to the layers. If you 
paint on a layer mask with black, the areas under those black areas don’t 
show the adjustment. If you paint with a shade of gray, those areas partially 
show the adjustment. The darker the shade of gray, the less it shows the 
adjustment, as shown in Figure 8-5. Note that if you have an active selection 
border in your image before you add an adjustment layer, the adjustment 
is applied only to that area within the selection border. The resulting layer 
mask also reflects that selection: The selected areas are white, and the unse-
lected areas are black.

contrast in your image.

175
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
You can also use just the layer 
mask to creatively blend two layers. 
Create an adjustment layer and just 
don’t make any adjustment settings. 
Then, use the layer mask to blend 
two layers. Be sure to sandwich the 
layer mask between the two layers. 
Then, select the topmost layer and 
choose Layer➪Group with Previous. 
Paint on your layer mask, as we 
describe earlier in this section, to 
selectively hide and show portions 
of your topmost layer.
Elements has eight kinds of adjust-
ment layers, and you can use as 
many as you want. These adjust-
ments are the same adjustments 
you find on the Enhance➪Adjust 
Lighting and Adjust Color and the 
Filter➪Adjustments submenus. For 
specifics on each adjustment, see 
Chapters 9 and 10. Here’s how to 
create an adjustment layer:
 
1. Open an image that needs 
a little contrast or color 
adjustment.
 
 Note that you don’t need to 
convert your background into a layer to apply an adjustment layer.
 
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers panel and from 
the drop-down list, choose your desired adjustment.
 
 The dialog box specific to your adjustment appears.
 
3. Make the necessary adjustments and click OK.
 
 After you close the dialog box, the adjustment layer appears on the 
Layers panel. The Adjustment Layer icon and a thumbnail appear on the 
adjustment layer. The thumbnail represents the layer mask.
 
You can paint on the layer mask to selectively allow only portions of your 
image to receive the adjustment. Use the Brush or Pencil tool to paint. Or, 
you can also make a selection and fill that selection with any shade of gray, 
from white to black. Finally, you can use the Gradient tool on the mask to 
create a gradual application of the adjustment.

176
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
As with image layers, you can adjust the opacity and blend modes of an 
adjustment layer. Reducing the opacity of an adjustment layer reduces the 
effect of the adjustment on the underlying layers.
 
Here are a few more tips on using adjustment layers:
 
✓ To view your image without the adjustment: Click the eye icon in the 
left column of the Layers panel to hide the adjustment layer.
 
✓ To delete the adjustment layer: Drag it to the trash can icon on the 
Layers panel.
 
✓ To edit an adjustment layer: Simply double-click the adjustment layer 
on the Layers panel. You can also choose Layer➪Layer Content Options. 
In the dialog box that appears, make any edits and then click OK. The 
only adjustment layer that you can’t edit is the Invert adjustment. It’s 
either on or off.
 
✓ To switch to a different adjustment layer: Choose Layer➪Change Layer 
Content and choose a different adjustment layer from the submenu.
Fill layers
A fill layer lets you add a layer of solid color, a gradient, or a pattern. Like 
adjustment layers, fill layers also include layer masks. You can edit, rear-
range, duplicate, delete, and merge fill layers similarly to adjustment layers. 
You can blend fill layers with other layers by using the opacity and blend 
mode options on the Layers panel. Finally, you can restrict the fill layer to 
just a portion of your image by either making a selection first or painting on 
the mask later.
Follow these steps to create a fill layer:
 
1. Open an image.
 
 Use an image that will look good with a frame or border of some kind. 
Remember that if you don’t have a selection, the fill layer covers your 
whole image.
 
2. Click the Create Adjustment Layer icon on the Layers panel. From the 
drop-down list, choose a fill of a solid color, gradient, or pattern.
 
 The dialog box specific to your type of fill appears.
 
3. Specify your options, depending on the fill type you choose in Step 2:
 
• Solid Color: Choose your desired color from the Color Picker. See 
Chapter 12 for details on choosing colors and also gradients and 
patterns.
 
• Gradient: Click the down-pointing arrow to choose a preset gradi-
ent from the drop-down panel or click the gradient preview to dis-
play the Gradient Editor and create your own gradient.

177
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
 
• Pattern: Select a pattern from the drop-down panel. Enter a value 
to scale your pattern, if you want. Click Snap to Origin to make the 
origin of the pattern the same as the origin of the document. Select 
the Link with Layer option to specify that the pattern moves with 
the fill layer if you move that layer.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 The fill layer appears on the Layers panel, as shown in Figure 8-6. Notice 
the layer mask that was created on the fill layer.

Shape layers
If you haven’t made your way to Chapter 12 yet, you may be surprised to 
discover that Elements also lets you draw shapes with six different drawing 
tools. These shapes also have the bonus of being vector-based. This term 
means that the shapes are defined by mathematical equations, which create 
points and paths, rather than by pixels. The advantage of vector-based 
objects is that you can freely size these objects without causing degradation. 
In addition, they’re always printed with smooth edges, not with the jaggies 
you’re familiar with seeing in pixel-based elements.

178
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
To create a shape layer, grab a shape tool from the Tools panel and drag it 
on your canvas. When you create a shape, it resides on its own, unique shape 
layer, as shown in Figure 8-7. As with other types of layers, you can adjust the 
blend modes and opacity of a shape layer. You can edit, move, and transform 
the actual shapes. However, to apply filters, you must first simplify the shape 
layer. This process converts the vector paths to pixels.
 
Corbis, PhotoDisc/Getty Images
Figure 8-7: Shape layers are vector-based, allowing for smooth edges and optimum print quality.
Type layers
To add words to your images, as shown in Figure 8-7, click your canvas with 
the Type tool and just type. It’s really as easy as that. Well, you can specify 
options, such as a font family and size, on the Options bar, but when you 
click the Commit button on the Options bar, you create a type layer. On the 
Layers panel, you see a layer with a T icon. For details on working with type, 
check out Chapter 13.

179
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
Tackling Layer Basics
Image layers are the heart and soul of the layering world. You can create 
multiple image layers within a single image. Even more fun is creating a com-
posite from several different images. Add people you like; take out people 
you don’t. Pluck people out of boring photo studios and put them in exotic 
locales. The creative possibilities are endless. In the following sections, we 
cover all the various ways to create image layers. We cover how to convert 
a background into a layer in the section “Getting to Know Layers,” earlier in 
this chapter. The following sections describe how to create an image layer by 
using various other methods.
Creating a new layer from scratch
If you’re creating a new, blank file, you can select the Transparent option for 
your background contents. Your new file is created with a transparent layer 
and is ready to go. If you have an existing file and want to create a new, blank 
layer, here are the ways to do so:
 
✓ Click the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the Layers panel.
 
✓ Choose New Layer from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ Choose Layer➪New➪Layer.
Note that if you create a layer by using either of the menu commands, you’re 
presented with a dialog box with options. In that dialog box, you can name 
your layer and specify options for grouping, blending, and adjusting opacity. 
Provide a name for your layer and click OK. You can always adjust the other 
options directly on the Layers panel later.
 
You can also use the Copy and Paste commands without even creating a 
blank layer first. When you copy and paste a selection without a blank layer, 
Elements automatically creates a new layer from the pasted selection. A 
better method of copying and pasting between multiple images, however, is 
to use the drag-and-drop method, which we describe in the section “Dragging 
and dropping layers,” later in this chapter.
 
The Copy Merged command on the Edit menu creates a merged copy of all 
visible layers within the selection.
After you create your layer, you can put selections or other elements on that 
layer by doing one or more of the following:
 
✓ Grab a painting tool, such as the Brush or Pencil, and paint on the layer.
 
✓ Make a selection on another layer or on the background within the 
same document, or from another image entirely, and then choose 

180
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Edit➪Copy. Select your new, 
blank layer on the Layers panel 
and then choose Edit➪Paste. 
You can also choose Select➪All 
and then copy and paste to 
transfer an entire image to the 
new layer.
 
✓ Make a selection on another 
layer or on the background 
within the same document, 
or from another image, and 
then choose Edit➪Cut. Select 
your new, blank layer and then 
choose Edit➪Paste. Be aware 
that this action removes that 
selection from its original loca-
tion and leaves a transparent hole, as shown in Figure 8-8.
Using Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut
Another way to create a layer is to use the Layer via Copy and Layer via Cut 
commands on the Layer menu. Make a selection on a layer or background, 
and choose Layer➪New➪Layer via Copy or Layer via Cut. Elements auto-
matically creates a new layer and puts the copied or cut selection on the 
layer. Remember that if you use the Layer via Cut command, your selection 
is deleted from its original location layer, and you’re left with a transparent 
hole. If you use the background for the source, your background color fills 
the space. A reminder: You can use these two commands only within the 
same image. You can’t use them between multiple images.
Duplicating layers
Duplicating layers can be helpful if you want to protect your original image 
while experimenting with a technique. If you don’t like the results, you can 
always delete the duplicate layer. No harm, no foul.
To duplicate an existing layer, select it on the Layers panel and do one of 
three things:
 
✓ Drag the layer to the Create a New Layer icon at the top of the panel. 
Elements creates a duplicate layer with Copy appended to the name of 
the layer.
 
✓ Choose Duplicate Layer from the Layers panel pop-up menu.
 
✓ Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer.

layer, take note of the resulting hole in the 
original location.

181
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
If you use the menu methods, a dialog box appears, asking you to name your 
layer and specify other options. Provide a name for your layer and click OK. 
You can specify the other options later, if you want.
Dragging and dropping layers
The most efficient way to copy and paste layers between multiple images is 
to use the drag-and-drop method. Why? Because it bypasses your Clipboard, 
which is the temporary storage area on your computer for copied data. 
Storing data, especially large files, can bog down your system. By keep-
ing your Clipboard clear of data, your system operates more efficiently. 
If you already copied data and it’s lounging on your Clipboard, choose 
Edit➪Clear➪Clipboard Contents to empty your Clipboard.
Here’s how to drag and drop layers from one file to another:
 
1. Select your desired layer in the Layers panel.
 
2. Grab the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) from the Tools panel.
 
3. Drag and drop the layer onto your destination file.
 
 The dropped layer pops in as a new layer above the active layer in the 
image. You don’t need to have a selection border to copy the entire 
layer. But, if you want to copy just a portion of the layer, make your 
selection before you drag and drop with the Move tool. If you want the 
selected element to be centered on the destination file, press the Shift 
key while you drag and drop.
 
Here’s a handy tip. If you have several elements (that aren’t touching each 
other) on one layer and you want to select only one of the elements to drag 
and drop, use the Lasso tool to make a crude selection around the object 
without touching any of the other elements. Then press the Ctrl (Ô on the 
Mac) key and press the up-arrow key once. The element then becomes per-
fectly selected. Drag and drop with the Move tool.
Using the Paste into Selection command
The Paste into Selection command lets you put an image on a separate layer 
while also inserting that image into a selection border. For example, in Figure 
8-9, we used this command to make it appear as though our surfer is in the 
water.
You can do the same by following these steps:
 
1. Make your desired selection on the layer in your destination image.
 
 In our figure, we selected the area in the water where the surfer would 
be positioned.

182
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Figure 8-9: Use the Paste into Selection command to make one element 
appear as though it’s coming out of another element.
 
2. Select the image that will fill that selection.
 
 The image can be within the same file or from another file. Our surfer 
was in another file.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Copy.
 
4. Return to the destination image layer and choose Edit➪Paste into 
Selection.
 
 Elements converts the selection border on the layer into a layer mask. 
The pasted selection is visible only inside the selection border. In our 
example, the surfer only shows inside the selected area. His ankles and 
feet are outside the border and therefore are hidden.
Moving a Layer’s Content
Moving the content of a layer is a piece of cake: Grab the Move tool from the 
Tools panel, select your layer on the Layers panel, and drag the element on 
the canvas to your desired location. You can also move the layer in 1-pixel 
increments by using the keyboard arrow keys. Press Shift with the arrows to 
move in 10-pixel increments.
 
The Auto-Select Layer option on the Options bar enables you to switch to a 
layer when you click any part of that layer with the Move tool. But be careful 
if you have a lot of overlapping layers because this technique can sometimes 
be more trouble than it’s worth.

183
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
The Move tool has a couple of additional options. Here’s the lowdown:
 
✓ Show Bounding Box: This option surrounds the contents of your layer 
with a dotted box that has handles, enabling you to easily transform 
your layer. Find details in the following section.
 
✓ Show Highlight on Rollover: Hover your mouse anywhere over the 
canvas to make an outline appear around the element on your layer. 
Click the highlighted layer to select it and then move it.
 
✓ Arrange menu: This menu enables you to change your selected layer’s 
position in the stacking order.
 
✓ Link Layers: This option, which resides not on the Options bar, but in 
the Layers panel, connects the layers to allow ease in moving (or trans-
forming) multiple layers simultaneously. Select a layer and then Ctrl-
click (Ô-click on the Mac) to select more layers. Click the Link Layers 
option.
 
✓ Align menu: Align your selected layers on the left, center, right, top, 
middle, and bottom. As with linking, select your first layer and then 
Shift-click to select more layers. Choose an alignment option.
 
✓ Distribute menu: Use this menu to evenly space your selected layers on 
the left, center, right, top, middle, and bottom. Like with aligning, select 
your first layer and then Shift-click to select more layers. Choose your 
desired distribution option. 
Transforming Layers
When working with layers, you may find the need to scale or rotate some 
of your images. You can do so easily by applying the Transform and Free 
Transform commands. The methods to transform layers and transform 
selections are identical.
Here’s how to transform a layer:
 
1. Select your desired layer.
 
 You can also apply a transformation to multiple layers simultaneously 
by linking the layers first.
 
2. Choose Image➪Transform➪Free Transform.
 
 A bounding box surrounds the contents of your layer. Drag a corner 
handle to size the contents. Press Shift while dragging to constrain the 
proportions. To rotate the contents, move the mouse cursor just outside 
a corner handle until it turns into a curved arrow and then drag. To dis-
tort, skew, or apply perspective to the contents, right-click and choose 
the desired command from the context menu. You can also click the 

184
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
rotate, scale, and skew icons in the Options bar, as well as enter your 
transform values numerically in the fields.
 
 If you want to apply just a single transformation, you can also choose 
the individual Distort, Skew, and Perspective commands from 
the Image➪Transform menu. Or, to rotate or flip, you can choose 
Image➪Rotate.
 
3. When your layer is transformed to your liking, double-click inside the 
bounding.
 
Try to perform all your transformations in one execution. Each time you 
transform pixels, you put your image through the interpolation process (see 
Chapter 3 for more on interpolation). Done to the extreme, this process can 
degrade the quality of your image. This is why it’s prudent to use the Free 
Transform command, rather than individual commands — so that all trans-
formations can be executed in one fell swoop.
 
When the Move tool is active, you can transform a layer without choosing 
a command. Select the Show Bounding Box option on the Options bar. This 
option surrounds the layer, or selection, with a box that has handles. Drag 
the handles to transform the layer or selection.
Flattening and Merging Layers
Layers are fun and fantastic, but they can quickly chew up your computer’s 
RAM and bloat your file size. And sometimes, to be honest, having too many 
layers can start to make your file tedious to manage, thereby making you 
less productive. Whenever possible, you can merge your layers to save 
memory and space. Merging combines visible, linked, or adjacent layers into 
a single layer (not a background). The intersection of all transparent areas is 
retained.
In addition, if you need to import your file into another program, certain 
programs don’t support files with layers. Therefore, you may need to flatten 
your file before importing it. Flattening an image combines all visible layers 
into a background, including type, shape, fill, and adjustment layers. You’re 
prompted as to whether you want to discard hidden layers, and any transpar-
ent areas are filled with white. We recommend, however, that before you flat-
ten your image, you make a copy of the file with all its layers intact and save 
it as a native Photoshop file. That way, if you ever need to make any edits, 
you have the added flexibility of having your layers.
 
By the way, the only file formats that support layers are native Photoshop 
(.psd); Tagged Image File Format, or TIFF (.tif); and Portable Document 
Format, or PDF (.pdf). If you save your file in any other format, Elements 
automatically flattens your layers into a background.

185
 Chapter 8: Working with Layers
Flattening layers
To flatten an image, follow these steps:
 
1. Make certain that all layers you want to retain are visible.
 
 If you have any hidden layers, Elements asks you if you want to discard 
those hidden layers.
 
2. Choose Flatten Image from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer 
menu.
 
 All your layers are combined into a single background, as shown in 
Figure 8-10.
 
 If you mistakenly flatten your image, choose Edit➪Undo or use your 
Undo History panel. (If you’re not familiar with the History panel, see 
Chapter 1 for details.)

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Merging layers
You can merge your layers in a couple of ways. Here’s how:
 
✓ Display only those layers you want to merge. Click the eye icon on 
the Layers panel to hide those layers you don’t want to merge. Choose 
Merge Visible from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer menu.
 
✓ Arrange the layers you want to merge so that they’re adjacent to each 
other on the Layers panel. Select the topmost layer of that group and 
choose Merge Down from the Layers panel pop-up menu or the Layer 
menu. Note that Merge Down merges your active layer with the layer 
directly below it.

▶ Cropping and straightening your images
▶ Using one-step auto fixes
▶ Editing in Quick Fix mode
▶ Fixing small imperfections
F
ixing images quickly without pain or hassle is probably one of the most 
desirable features you’ll find in Elements and one that we’re sure you’ll 
embrace frequently. Whether you’re an experienced photographer or an ama-
teur shutterbug, cropping away unwanted background, tweaking the lighting 
or color of an image, and erasing away the minor blemishes of a loved one’s 
face are all editing tasks you’ll most likely tackle. With these simple image-
makeover tools in Elements, these tasks are as easy as clicking a 
single button or making a few swipes with a brush.
Cropping and Straightening Images
Cropping a photo is probably one of the easiest 
things you can do to improve the composition 
of your photo. Getting rid of the unnecessary 
background around your subject creates a better 
focal point. Another dead giveaway of amateurish 
photography is crooked horizon lines. Not a prob-
lem. Elements gives you several ways to straighten 
those images after the fact. So, after your next photo 
shoot, launch the Elements editor and then crop and 
straighten your images before you show them off. 
Cutting away with the Crop tool
The most common way to crop a photo is by using the Crop tool. Simple, 
quick, and easy, this tool gets the job done. Here’s how to use it:

188
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
1. Select the Crop tool from the Tools panel in either Full Edit or Quick 
Fix mode.
 
 You can also press the C key. For details on the different workspaces, 
see Chapter 1. For full details on Quick Fix mode, see the section 
“Editing with Quick Fix,” later in this chapter.
 
2. Specify your aspect ratio options on the Options bar.
 
 Here are your choices:
 
• No Restriction: Allows you to freely crop the image at any size.
 
• Use Photo Ratio: Retains the original aspect ratio of the image when 
you crop.
 
• Preset Sizes: Offers a variety of common photographic sizes. When 
you crop, your image then becomes that specific dimension.
 
 When you crop an image, Elements retains the original resolution 
of the file. Therefore, to keep your image at the same resolution 
while simultaneously eliminating portions of your image, Elements 
must resample the file. Consequently, your image must have suf-
ficient resolution so that the effects of the resampling aren’t too 
noticeable. This is especially true if you’re choosing a larger preset 
size. If all this talk about resolution and resampling is fuzzy, be 
sure to check out Chapter 3.
 
• Width and Height: Enables you to specify a desired width and 
height to crop your image.
 
3. Drag around the portion of the image you want to retain and release 
the mouse button.
 
 When you drag, a crop marquee bounding box appears. Don’t worry if 
your cropping marquee isn’t exactly correct. You can adjust it in Step 4.
 
 The area outside the cropping marquee (called a shield ) appears 
darker than the inside in order to better frame your image, as shown 
in Figure 9-1. If you want to change the color and opacity of the shield, 
or if you don’t want it at all, change your Crop preferences (choose 
Edit➪Preferences➪Display & Cursors [Elements➪Preferences➪Display 
& Cursors on the Mac]).
 
4. Adjust the cropping marquee by dragging the handles of the crop mar-
quee bounding box.
 
 To move the entire marquee, position your mouse inside the marquee 
until you see a black arrowhead cursor and then drag.
 
 If you move your mouse outside the marquee, your cursor changes to a 
curved arrow. Drag with this cursor to rotate the marquee. This action 
allows you to both rotate and crop your image simultaneously — handy 
for straightening a crooked image. Just be aware that rotation, unless 
it’s in 90-degree increments, also resamples your image.

5. Double-click inside the cropping marquee.
 
 You can also just press Enter or click the green Commit button next to 
the marquee. Elements then discards the area outside the marquee. To 
cancel your crop, click the red Cancel button.
Cropping with a selection border
You can also crop an image by choosing Image➪Crop in either Full Edit or 
Quick Fix mode. First, make a selection with any of the selection tools and 
then choose the command. You can use this technique with any selection 
border shape. That is, your selection doesn’t have to be rectangular. It can be 
round or even freeform. Your cropped image doesn’t take on that shape, but 
Elements crops as close to the boundaries of the selection border as it can. 
For details about making selections, see Chapter 7.
Straightening images
There may be times when you just didn’t quite get that horizon straight when 
you took a photo of the beach. Or, maybe you scanned a photo and it wasn’t 

190
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
quite centered in the middle of the scanning bed. It’s not a big deal. Elements 
gives you several ways to straighten an image.
Using the Straighten tool
This tool enables you to specify a new straight edge, and it then rotates the 
image accordingly. Here’s how to use the Straighten tool:
 
1. Select the Straighten tool from the Tools panel (or press the P key) 
only in Full Edit mode.
 
2. Specify your desired setting from the Canvas Options on the 
Options bar.
 
 Here are your choices:
 
• Grow or Shrink Canvas to Fit: Rotates the image and increases or 
decreases the size of the canvas to fit the image area.
 
• Crop to Remove Background: Trims off background canvas outside 
the image area. This choice is helpful if you scan an image and 
white areas appear around your photo that you want removed.
 
• Crop to Original Size: Rotates your image without trimming off any 
background canvas.
 
3. (Optional) Select Rotate All Layers.
 
 If you have an image with layers and you want all of them rotated, select 
this option.
 
4. Draw a line in your image to represent the new straight edge.
 
 Your image is then straightened and, if you chose either of the crop 
options in Step 2, also cropped.
Using the Straighten menu commands
In addition to using the Straighten tool, you can straighten your images by 
using two commands on the Image menu, in either Full Edit or Quick Fix 
mode:
 
✓ To automatically straighten an image without cropping: Choose 
Image➪Rotate➪Straighten Image. This straightening technique leaves 
the canvas around the image.
 
✓ To automatically straighten and crop the image simultaneously: 
Choose Image➪Rotate➪Straighten and Crop Image.
Using the Divide Scanned Photos command
The Divide Scanned Photos command is helpful if you want to save time by 
scanning multiple photos into one document. Cram all the photos you can 
on your scanning bed and get one initial scan. Just make sure that a clear 

191
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
separation exists between all the images. Then, choose Image➪Divide 
Scanned Photos in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode. Elements divides the 
images and places each one in a separate file. Note that if you have images 
with a lot of white in them, such as snow, you should cover the scanner with 
a piece of dark paper to better delineate the boundaries of each image.
Employing One-Step Auto Fixes
Elements has five automatic lighting-, contrast-, and color-correction tools 
that can improve the appearance of your images with just one menu com-
mand. These commands are available in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, 
and they’re all on the Enhance menu. For more on Quick Fix mode, see the 
section “Editing with Quick Fix,” later in this chapter.
The advantage of these one-step correctors is that they’re extremely easy to 
use. You don’t need to have one iota of knowledge about color or contrast to 
use them. The downside to using them is that sometimes the result isn’t as 
good as you could get via a manual color-correction method. And sometimes 
these correctors may even make your image look worse than before by giving 
you weird color shifts. But because these correctors are quick and easy, give 
them a try on an image that needs some help. Usually, you don’t want to use 
more than one of the auto fixes. If one doesn’t work on your image, undo the 
fix and try another. If you still don’t like the result, move on to one of the 
manual methods we describe in Chapter 10.
Auto Smart Fix
This all-in-one command is touted to adjust it all. It’s designed to improve 
lighting, improve the details in shadow and highlight areas, and correct the 
color balance, as shown in Figure 9-2. The overexposed image on the left was 
improved quite nicely with the Auto Smart Fix command.
 
 
Figure 9-2: In a hurry? Apply the Auto Smart Fix command to quickly improve an image.

192
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
The Auto Smart Fix command, as well as the Auto Color, Auto Levels, Auto 
Contrast, Auto Sharpen, and Auto Red Eye Fix, are available in the Organizer 
(under the Fix pane), where you can apply the commands to several selected 
images simultaneously.
If the Auto Smart Fix was just too “auto” for you, you can crank it up a notch 
and try Adjust Smart Fix. This command is similar to Auto Smart Fix, but 
gives you a slider that allows you, not Elements, to control the amount of cor-
rection applied to the image.
Auto Levels
The Auto Levels command adjusts the overall contrast of an image. This 
command works best on images that have pretty good contrast (even range 
of tones and detail in the shadow, highlight, and midtone areas) to begin with 
and need just a minor amount of adjustment. Auto Levels works by mapping, 
or converting, the lightest and darkest pixels in your image to black and 
white, thereby making highlights appear lighter and shadows appear darker, 
as shown in Figure 9-3.
 
 
Figure 9-3: Auto Levels adjusts the overall contrast of an image.
 
Although Auto Levels can improve your contrast, it may also produce an 
unwanted colorcast (a slight trace of color). If this happens, undo the com-
mand and try the Auto Contrast command instead. If that still doesn’t 
improve the contrast, it’s time to bring out the big guns. Try the Levels 
command we describe in Chapter 10.
Auto Contrast
The Auto Contrast command is designed to adjust the overall contrast in an 
image without adjusting its color. This command may not do as good a job of 
improving contrast as the Auto Levels command, but it does a better job of 
retaining the color balance of an image. Auto Contrast usually doesn’t cause 

193
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
the funky colorcasts that can occur when you’re using Auto Levels. This com-
mand works great on images with a haze, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 
PhotoDisc/Getty Images
 
Figure 9-4: The Auto Contrast command works wonders on hazy images.
Auto Color Correction
The Auto Color Correction command adjusts both the color and contrast 
of an image, based on the shadows, midtones, and highlights it finds in the 
image and a default set of values. These values adjust the amount of black 
and white pixels that Elements removes from the darkest and lightest areas 
of the image. You usually use this command to remove a colorcast or to 
balance the color in your image, as shown in Figure 9-5. Occasionally, this 
command can also be useful in correcting oversaturated or undersaturated 
colors.
 
 
Figure 9-5: Use Auto Color Correction to remove a colorcast.

194
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Auto Sharpen
Photos taken with a digital camera or scanned on a flatbed scanner often 
suffer from a case of overly soft focus. Sharpening gives the illusion of 
increased focus by increasing the contrast between pixels. Auto Sharpen 
attempts to improve the focus, as shown in Figure 9-6, without overdoing it. 
What happens when you oversharpen? Your images go from soft to grainy 
and noisy. Always make sharpening your last fix after you make all your 
other fixes and enhancements. For more precise sharpening, check out the 
Unsharp Mask and Adjust Sharpness features we cover in Chapter 10.
 
 
Figure 9-6: Use Auto Sharpen to improve focus.
Auto Red Eye Fix
This command is self-explanatory. The Auto Red Eye Fix command automati-
cally detects and eliminates red-eye in an image. Red-eye happens when a 
person or animal (where red-eye can also be yellow-, green-, or even blue-
eye) looks directly into the flash. Many cameras have a red-eye prevention 
mode, which is a pre-flash that causes the subjects’ irises to contract, making 
their pupils smaller when the real flash goes off. Other cameras mount the 
flash high or to side of the lens, which also reduces the chance of red-eye. 
But if you have neither of these camera options, or if it just happened, it isn’t 
difficult to rectify demonic red-eye after the fact.
 
If for some reason the Auto Red Eye Fix doesn’t quite do the trick, you can 
always reach for the Red Eye Removal tool on the Tools panel. Here’s how to 
remove red-eye manually:

195
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
1. Select the Red Eye Removal tool from the Tools panel.
 
 Using the default settings, click the red portion of the eye in your image. 
This one-click tool darkens the pupil while retaining the tonality and tex-
ture of the rest of the eye, as shown in Figure 9-7.
 
 
Figure 9-7: The Auto Red Eye Fix and the Red Eye Removal tool detect and destroy dreaded 
 
red-eye.
 
2. If you’re unhappy with the fix, adjust one or both of these options:
 
• Pupil Size: Use the slider to increase or decrease the size of the 
pupil.
 
• Darken Pupil: Use the slider to darken or lighten the color of the 
pupil.
 
If you’re trying to fix green-eye in animals, your best bet is to use the Color 
Replacement Tool. See the section “Replacing One Color with Another,” at 
the end of this chapter.
Editing with Quick Fix
If you use the auto fixes that we cover in the preceding sections while work-
ing in Quick Fix mode, you may find all you need to repair and enhance your 
images, so you rarely have to visit Full Edit mode. And so, in this section, we 
offer a closer look at Quick Fix mode.

196
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Quick Fix mode is a pared-down version of Full Edit mode that conveniently 
provides basic fixing tools and tosses in a few unique features, such as a 
before-and-after preview of your image.
Here’s a step-by-step workflow that you can follow in Quick Fix mode to 
repair your photos:
 
1. Select one or more photos in the Organizer, click Fix in the upper-
right of the application window, and then click the Quick Fix button 
in the panel below.
 
 Or, if you’re in Full Edit mode, select your desired image(s) from the 
Photo Bin and then click the Quick button in the upper-right area of the 
application window.
 
 Note that you can also open images by simply choosing File➪Open.
 
2. Specify your preview preference from the View pop-up menu at the 
bottom of the application window.
 
 You can choose to view just your original image (Before Only), your 
fixed image (After Only), or both images side by side (Before & After) 
in either portrait (Vertical) or landscape (Horizontal) orientation, as 
shown in Figure 9-8.

Figure 9-8: Quick Fix mode enables you to view before-and-after previews of your image.

197
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
3. Use the Zoom and Hand tools to magnify and navigate around your 
image (see Chapter 5 for more on these tools).
 
 You can also specify the Zoom percentage by using the Zoom slider at 
the bottom of the application window.
 
4. Crop your image by using the Crop tool on the Tools panel.
 
 You can also use any of the methods we describe in the “Cropping and 
Straightening Images” section, earlier in this chapter, except for the 
Straighten tool, which is exclusive to Full Edit mode.
 
5. To rotate the image in 90-degree increments, click the Rotate Left or 
Rotate Right button at the bottom of the application window.
 
6. Use the Auto Red Eye fix to remove the red from your subjects’ eyes.
 
 Automatically fix red-eye by clicking the Auto button under Red Eye Fix 
on the General Fixes panel on the right side of the application window. 
If that doesn’t work, try the Red Eye Removal tool in the new Touch Up 
pane.
 
7. Apply any necessary auto fixes, such as Auto Smart Fix, Auto Levels, 
Auto Contrast, and Auto Color Correction.
 
 All these commands are on the Enhance menu or in the General Fixes, 
Lighting, and Color panels on the right side of the application window.
 
 Each of these fixes is described in detail in the section “Employing One-
Step Auto Fixes,” earlier in this chapter. Remember that usually one of 
the fixes is enough. Don’t stack them on top of each other. If one doesn’t 
work, click the Reset button in the top-right of the image preview and try 
another. If you’re not happy, go to Step 8. If you are happy, skip to Step 9.
 
8. If the auto fixes don’t quite cut it, get more control by using the slid-
ers available for Smart Fix, Levels, Contrast, and Color, located on the 
panels on the right of the application window.
 
 Here’s a brief description of each available adjustment:
 
• Lighten Shadows: When you drag the slider to the right, lightens 
the darker areas of your image without adjusting the highlights.
 
• Darken Highlights: When you drag the slider to the right, darkens 
the lighter areas of your image without adjusting the shadows.
 
• Midtone Contrast: Adjusts the contrast of the middle (gray) values 
and leaves the highlights and shadows as they are.
 
• Saturation: Adjusts the intensity of the colors.
 
• Hue: Changes all colors in an image. Make a selection first to 
change the color of just one or more elements. Otherwise, use 
restraint with this adjustment.
 
• Temperature: Adjusts the colors to make them warmer (red) or 
cooler (blue). This adjustment can be used to correct skin tones 

198
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
or to correct overly cool images (such as snowy winter photos) or 
overly warm images (such as photos shot at sunset or sunrise).
 
• Tint: Adjusts the tint after you adjust temperature to make the 
color more green or magenta.
 
 If you still don’t get the results you need, move on to one of the more 
manual adjustments that we describe in Chapter 10.
 
 Note that you can also apply fixes to just selected portions of your 
image. Quick Fix mode offers the Quick Selection tool for your selection 
tasks. For details on using this tool, see Chapter 7.
 
9. Add finishing fixes by using the new Touch Up pane.
 
 Here are the Touch Up pane options:
 
• Red Eye Removal Tool: If the Auto Red Eye Fix didn’t work, try 
using this tool. This method is described in the section “Auto Red 
Eye Fix,” earlier in this chapter.
 
• Whiten Teeth: This new fix does what it says — it whitens teeth. 
Be sure to choose an appropriate brush size from the Brushes 
drop-down panel before whitening (for more on brush options, see 
Chapter 12). Using a brush diameter that’s larger than the area of 
the teeth also whitens/brightens whatever else it touches — lips, 
chin, and so on. Click the teeth. Note that this tool makes a selec-
tion and whitens simultaneously. After your initial click, your selec-
tion option converts from New Selection to Add to Selection in the 
Options bar. If you pick up too much in your dental selection, click 
the Subtract from Selection option and click the area you want to 
eliminate. When you’re happy with the results of your whitening ses-
sion, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D (Ô+D on the Mac).
 
• Make Dull Skies Blue: Click or drag over areas of your sky that need 
brightening. Choosing a brush size and selection option is similar 
to using the Whiten Teeth fix, described in the preceding bullet. 
When you click your sky, it is selected and brightened at the same 
time. When you’re done, choose Select➪Deselect or press Ctrl+D 
(Ô+D on the Mac).
 
• High Contrast Black and White Image: This tool converts your image 
into a high-contrast grayscale image. The method and options are 
similar to those for the Whiten Teeth and Make Dull Skies Blue 
options, described in the preceding bullets. Figure 9-9 shows a 
color image converted into a grayscale image that looks like a vin-
tage newspaper photo.
 
 Note that you can find these same fixes (and many more) in Full Edit 
mode, under the new Smart Brush and Detailed Smart Brush tools. 
Check out Chapter 10 for the lowdown on these tools.

Figure 9-9: The High Contrast Black and White fix converts a color image into a grayscale one.
 
10. Finally, sharpen your image either automatically (by clicking the Auto 
button) or manually (by dragging the slider on the Sharpen panel).
 
 This fix should always be the last adjustment you make on your image.
Cloning with the Clone 
Stamp Tool
Elements enables you to clone ele-
ments without the hassle of geneti-
cally engineering DNA. In fact, the 
Clone Stamp tool works by just 
taking sampled pixels from one area 
and copying, or cloning, them onto 
another area. The advantage of clon-
ing, rather than making a selection 
and then copying and pasting, is that 
it’s easier to realistically retain soft-
edged elements, such as shadows, as 
shown in Figure 9-10.
The Clone Stamp doesn’t stop there. 
You can also use this tool for fixing 
flaws, such as scratches, bruises, and 
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-10: The Clone Stamp tool enables you 
to realistically duplicate soft-edged elements, 
such as shadows.

200
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
other minor imperfections. Although the birth of the healing tools (discussed 
in the following sections) has somewhat pushed the Clone Stamp tool out of 
the retouching arena, it can still do a good repair job in many instances.
Here’s how to use the Clone Stamp tool:
 
1. Choose the Clone Stamp tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit mode.
 
2. On the Options bar, choose a brush from the Brush Preset drop-down 
list, and then use the brush as is or adjust its size with the Size slider.
 
 Keep in mind that the size of the brush you specify should be appropri-
ate for what you’re trying to clone or retouch. If you’re cloning a large 
object, use a large brush. For repairing small flaws, use a small brush. 
Cloning with a soft-edged brush usually produces more natural results. 
For details on brushes, see Chapter 12.
 
3. Choose your desired Blend Mode and Opacity percentage.
 
 For more on blend modes, see Chapter 11. To make your cloned image 
appear ghosted, use an opacity percentage of less than 100 percent.
 
4. Select or deselect the Aligned option.
 
 With Aligned selected, the clone source moves when you move your 
cursor to a different location. If you want to clone multiple times from 
the same location, leave the Aligned option deselected.
 
5. Select or deselect the All Layers option.
 
 This option enables you to sample pixels from all visible 
layers for the clone. If this option is deselected, the Clone 
Stamp tool clones from only the active layer. Check out 
Chapter 8 for details about working with layers.
 
6. Alt-click (Option-click) the area of your image that you 
want to clone to define the source of the clone.
 
7. Click or drag along the area where you want the clone to 
appear, as shown in Figure 9-11.
 
 While you drag, Elements displays a crosshair icon along with 
your Clone Stamp cursor. The crosshair is the source you’re 
cloning from, and the Clone Stamp cursor is where the clone 
is being applied. While you move the mouse, the crosshair 
moves, as well, so you have a continuous reference to the 
area of your image that you’re cloning. Watch the crosshair, 
or else you may clone something you don’t want.
 
If you’re cloning an element, try to clone it without lifting your 
mouse. Also, when you’re retouching a flaw, try not to overdo it. 
One or two clicks on each flaw is usually plenty. If you’re heavy-
handed with the Clone Stamp, you get a blotchy effect that’s a 
telltale sign something has been retouched.

and Clone

 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
Retouching with the Healing Brush
The Healing Brush tool is similar to the Clone Stamp tool in that you clone 
pixels from one area onto another area. But the Healing Brush is superior in 
that it takes into account the tonality (highlights, midtones, and shadows) 
of the flawed area. The Healing Brush clones by using the texture from the 
sampled area (the source) and then using the colors around the brush stroke 
while you paint over the flawed area (the destination). The highlights, mid-
tones, and shadow areas remain intact, giving you a realistic and natural 
repair that isn’t as blotchy or miscolored as the repair you get with the Clone 
Stamp tool.
Here are the steps to heal a photo:
 
1. Open an image in need of a makeover and select the Healing Brush 
tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit mode.
 
 You can also heal between two images, but be sure that they have the 
same color mode: for example, both RGB (red, green, blue). We chose 
a guy who looks like he might like to lose a few years, as shown in 
Figure 9-12.

2. Specify a diameter and hardness for your brush tip from the Brush 
Picker drop-down panel on the Options bar.
 
 You can also adjust the spacing, angle, and roundness. For details on 
these options, see Chapter 12. Don’t be shy. Be sure to adjust the size 
of your brush, as needed. Using the appropriate brush size for the flaw 
you’re retouching is critical to creating a realistic effect.
 
3. Choose your desired blend mode.
 
 For most retouching jobs, you probably should leave the mode as 
Normal. Replace mode preserves textures, such as noise or film grain, 
around the edges of your strokes.
 
4. Choose one of these Source options:
 
• Sampled: Uses the pixels from the image. You use this option for 
the majority of your repairs.
 
• Pattern: Uses pixels from a pattern chosen from the Pattern Picker 
drop-down panel.
 
5. Select or deselect the Aligned option on the Options bar.
 
 For most retouching tasks, you probably should leave Aligned selected. 
Here are the details on each option:
 
• With Aligned selected: When you click or drag with the Healing 
Brush, Elements displays a crosshair along with the Healing 
Brush cursor. The crosshair represents the sampling point, also 
known as the source. When you move the Healing Brush tool, the 
crosshair also moves, providing a constant reference to the area 
you’re sampling.
 
• With Aligned deselected: Elements applies the source pixels from 
your initial sampling point, no matter how many times you stop 
and start dragging.
 
6. Select the All Layers option to heal an image by using all visible layers.
 
 If this option is deselected, you heal from only the active layer.
 
 To ensure maximum editing flexibility later, select the All Layers option 
and add a new, blank layer above the image you want to heal. When 
you heal the image, the pixels appear on the new layer and not on the 
image itself; so, you can adjust opacity and blend modes and make other 
adjustments to the healed layer.
 
7. Establish the sampling point by Alt-clicking (Option-clicking on 
the Mac).
  
 Make sure to click the area of your image that you want to clone from. 
In our example, we clicked a smooth area of the forehead.
 
8. Release the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click or drag over a 
flawed area of your image.

203
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
 Keep an eye on the crosshair because that’s the area you’re healing 
from. We brushed over the wrinkles under and around the eyes and on 
the forehead (refer to Figure 9-12). This guy never looked so good, and 
he experienced absolutely no recovery time.
Zeroing In with the Spot Healing Brush
Whereas the Healing Brush is designed to fix larger flawed areas, the Spot 
Healing Brush is great for smaller imperfections. The Spot Healing Brush 
doesn’t require you to specify a sampling source. It automatically takes a 
sample from around the area to be retouched. It’s quick, easy, and often 
effective. But it doesn’t give you control over the sampling source, so keep 
an eye out for less-than-desirable fixes.
Here’s how to quickly fix small flaws with the Spot Healing Brush tool:
 
1. Open your image and grab the Spot Healing Brush tool in Full Edit 
mode.
 
 The moles on this guy’s face, as shown in Figure 9-13, are no match for 
the Spot Healing Brush.
 
PhotoSpin

204
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
2. On the Options bar, click the Brush Preset Picker and select a diam-
eter and hardness for your brush tip from the drop-down panel.
 
 Select a brush that’s a little larger than the flawed area you’re fixing.
 
3. Choose a blend mode from the Options bar.
 
 As with the Healing Brush, the most likely mode is Normal.
 
4. Choose a Type from the Options bar:
 
• Proximity Match: Samples the pixels around the edge of the selec-
tion to fix the flawed area.
 
• Create Texture: Uses all the pixels in the selection to create a tex-
ture to fix the flaw.
 
 Try Proximity Match first, and if it doesn’t work, undo it and try Create 
Texture.
 
5. Choose All Layers to heal an image by using all visible layers.
 
 If you leave this check box deselected, you heal from only the active 
layer.
 
6. Click or drag the area you want to fix.
 
 We clicked the moles with the Spot Healing Brush. For the wrinkles 
around the eyes, we broke out the Healing Brush. We needed more 
control of the sampling source to achieve realistic results.
Lightening and Darkening with 
Dodge and Burn Tools
The techniques of dodging and burning originated in the darkroom, where 
photographers fixed negatives that had overly dark or light areas by adding 
or subtracting exposure, using holes and paddles as an enlarger made 
prints. The Dodge and Burn tools are even better than their analog ancestors 
because they’re more flexible and much more precise. You can specify the 
size and softness of your tool by simply selecting from one of the many 
brush tips. You can also limit the correction to various tonal ranges in 
your image — shadows, midtones, or highlights. Finally, you can adjust the 
amount of correction that’s applied by specifying an exposure percentage.
 
Use these tools only on small areas, such as the girl’s face shown in Figure 
9-14, and in moderation. Also, keep in mind that you can’t add detail that isn’t 
there to begin with. If you try to lighten extremely dark shadows that contain 
little detail, you get gray areas. If you try to darken overly light highlights, 
you just end up with white blobs.

205
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
 
Figure 9-14: Use the Dodge and Burn tools to lighten and darken small areas.
Follow these steps to dodge or burn an image:
 
1. Choose either the Dodge (to lighten) or Burn (to darken) tool from the 
Tools panel in Full Edit mode.
 
2. Select a brush from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel and also 
adjust the brush size, if necessary.
 
 Larger, softer brushes spread the dodging or burning effect over a larger 
area, making blending with the surrounding area easier.
 
3. From the Range pop-up list, select Shadows, Midtones, or Highlights.
 
 Select Shadows to darken or lighten the darker areas of your image. 
Select Midtones to adjust the tones of average darkness. Select 
Highlights to make the light areas lighter or darker.
 
 In Figure 9-14, the original image had mostly dark areas, so we dodged 
the shadows.
 
4. Choose the amount of correction you want to apply with each stroke 
by adjusting the Exposure setting on the Options bar.
 
 Start with a lower percentage to better control the amount of darkening 
or lightening. Exposure is similar to the opacity setting that you use with 
the regular Brush tool. We used a setting of 10 percent.
 
5. Paint over the areas you want to lighten or darken.
 
 If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) to undo.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Smudging Away Rough Spots
The Smudge tool, one of the focus tools, pushes your pixels around using the 
color that’s under the cursor when you start to drag. Think of it as dragging 
a brush through wet paint. You can use this tool to create a variety of effects. 
When it’s used to the extreme, you can create a warped effect. When it’s used 
more subtly, you can soften the edges of objects in a more natural fashion 
than you can with the Blur tool. Or you can create images that take on a 
painterly effect, as shown in Figure 9-15. Keep an eye on your image while you 
paint, however, because you can start to eliminate detail and wreak havoc if 
you’re not careful with the Smudge tool.
 
PhotoSpin
 
Figure 9-15: The Smudge tool can make your images appear to be painted.
To use the Smudge tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the Smudge tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit mode.
 
2. Select a brush from the Brushes Preset Picker drop-down panel.

207
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
 Use a small brush for smudging tiny areas, such as edges. Larger 
brushes produce more extreme effects.
 
3. Select a blending mode from the Mode pop-up list.
 
4. Choose the strength of the smudging effect with the Strength slider or 
text box.
 
 The lower the value, the lighter the effect.
 
5. If your image has multiple layers, select All Layers to make Elements 
use pixels from all the visible layers when it produces the effect.
 
 The smudge still appears on only the active layer, but the look is a bit 
different, depending on the colors of the underlying layers.
 
6. Use the Finger Painting option to begin the smudge by using the fore-
ground color.
 
 Rather than use the color under your cursor, this option smears your 
foreground color at the start of each stroke. If you want the best of both 
worlds, you can quickly switch into Finger Painting mode by pressing 
the Alt key while you drag. Release Alt to go back to Normal mode.
 
7. Paint over the areas you want to smudge.
 
 Pay attention to your strokes because this tool can radically change 
your image. If you don’t like the results, press Ctrl+Z (Ô+Z on the Mac) 
to undo the changes and then lower the Strength percentage (discussed 
in Step 4) even more.
Softening with the Blur Tool
The Blur tool can be used for both repair and more artistic endeavors. You 
can use the Blur tool to soften a small flaw or part of a rough edge. You can 
add a little blur to an element to make it appear as though it was moving 
when photographed. You can also blur portions of your image to emphasize 
the focal point, as shown in Figure 9-16, where we blurred everything except 
the girl’s face. The Blur tool works by decreasing the contrast among adja-
cent pixels in the blurred area.
The mechanics of using the Blur tool and its options are similar to those of 
the Smudge tool, as we describe in the preceding section. When you use the 
Blur tool, be sure to use a small brush for smaller areas of blur.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
PhotoSpin
 
Figure 9-16: The Blur tool can be used to emphasize a focal point.
Focusing with the Sharpen Tool
If the Blur tool is yin, the Sharpen tool is yang. The Sharpen tool increases 
the contrast among adjacent pixels to give the illusion that things are 
sharper. This tool needs to be used with restraint, however. Sharpen can 
quickly give way to overly grainy and noisy images if you’re not cautious.
Use a light hand and keep the areas you sharpen small. Sometimes, the eyes 
in a soft portrait can benefit from a little sharpening, as shown in Figure 9-17. 
You can also slightly sharpen an area to emphasize it against a less-than-
sharp background.
 
To use the Sharpen tool, grab the tool from the Tools panel and follow the 
steps provided for the Smudge tool in the section “Smudging Away Rough 
Spots,” earlier in this chapter. In addition, here are some tips for using the 
Sharpen tool:

209
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
 
✓ Use a low value, around 25 per-
cent or less.
 
✓ Remember that you want to 
gradually sharpen your element 
to avoid the nasty, noisy 
grain that can occur from 
oversharpening.
 
✓ Because sharpening increases 
contrast, if you use other con-
trast adjustments, such as 
Levels, you boost the contrast 
of the sharpened area even 
more.
 
If you need to sharpen your over-
all image, try choosing either 
Enhance➪Unsharp Mask or 
Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness instead. 
These features offer more options 
and better control.
Sponging Color On and Off
The Sponge tool soaks up color or squeezes it out. In more technical terms, 
this tool reduces or increases the intensity, or saturation, of color in both 
color and grayscale images. Yes, the Sponge tool also works in Grayscale 
mode by darkening or lightening the brightness value of those pixels.
Like with the Blur and Sharpen tools, you can use the Sponge tool to reduce 
or increase the saturation in selected areas in order to draw attention to or 
away from those areas.
Follow these steps to sponge color on or off your image:
 
1. Choose the Sponge tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit mode.
 
 Press Shift+O to cycle through the Sponge, Dodge, and Burn tools.
 
2. Select a brush from the Brushes Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
 Use large, soft brushes to saturate or desaturate a larger area.
 
3. Choose either Desaturate or Saturate from the Mode pop-up list to 
decrease or increase color intensity, respectively.
PhotoSpin
Figure 9-17: Reserve the Sharpen tool for small 
areas, such as eyes.

210
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
4. Choose a flow rate with the Flow slider or text box.
 
 The flow rate is the speed with which the saturation or desaturation 
effect builds while you paint.
 
5. Paint carefully over the areas you want to saturate or desaturate with 
color.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 9-18, we saturated one of the women to 
make her more of a focal point and desaturated the others.
PhotoSpin

the color in your image.
Replacing One Color with Another
The Color Replacement tool allows you to replace the original color of an 
image with the foreground color. You can use this tool in a multitude of ways:
 
✓ Colorize a grayscale image to create the look of a hand-painted photo.
 
✓ Completely change the color of an element, or elements, in your image, 
as shown in Figure 9-19.
 
✓ Eliminate red-eye (or yellow-eye in animals) if other, more automated 
methods don’t work to your satisfaction.

211
 Chapter 9: Simple Image Makeovers
What we particularly like about the 
Color Replacement tool is that it 
preserves all the tones in the image. 
The color that’s applied isn’t like 
the opaque paint that’s applied 
when you paint with the Brush tool. 
When you’re replacing color, the 
midtones, shadows, and highlights 
are retained. The Color Replacement 
tool works by first sampling the 
original colors in the image and 
then replacing those colors with the 
foreground color. By specifying dif-
ferent sampling methods, limits, and 
tolerance settings, you can control 
the range of colors that Elements 
replaces.
Follow these steps to replace existing 
color with your foreground color:
 
1. Select the Color Replacement tool from the Tools panel in Full Edit 
mode.
 
 This tool shares a flyout menu with the Brush and Pencil tools.
 
2. Specify your desired brush tip diameter and hardness from the Brush 
Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
3. Choose your desired blend mode.
 
 Here’s a brief rundown of each one:
 
• Color: The default, this mode works well for most jobs. This mode 
works great for eliminating red-eye.
 
• Hue: Similar to color, this mode is less intense and provides a sub-
tler effect.
 
• Saturation: This mode is the one to use to convert the color in 
your image to grayscale. Set your foreground color to Black on the 
Tools panel.
 
• Luminosity: This mode, the opposite of Color, doesn’t provide 
much of an effect.
PhotoSpin

4. Choose your Sampling method (represented by the icons):
 
• Continuous: Samples and replaces color continuously while you 
drag your mouse.
 
• Once: Replaces colors only in areas that contain the color you first 
sampled when you initially clicked.
 
• Background Swatch: Replaces colors only in areas containing your 
current background color.
 
5. Select your Limits mode.
 
 You have these options:
 
• Contiguous: Replaces the color of adjacent pixels containing the 
sampled color.
 
• Discontiguous: Replaces the color of the pixels containing the sam-
pled color, whether or not they’re adjacent.
 
6. Set your Tolerance percentage.
 
 Tolerance refers to a range of color. The higher the value, the broader 
the range of color that’s sampled, and vice versa.
 
7. Select the Anti-Alias option.
 
 Anti-aliasing slightly softens the edges of the sampled areas.
 
8. Click or drag your image.
 
 The foreground color replaces the original colors of the sampled areas. 
In our example (refer to Figure 9-19), we used a black foreground color.
 
If you want to be very precise, make a selection before you replace your 
color. We did this with the girl in our figure so we could avoid “coloring 
outside the lines.”

f you’ve tried the quick and easy automatic fixes 
on your images and they didn’t quite do the job, 
you’ve come to the right place. The great thing about 
Elements is that it offers multiple ways and multiple 
levels of repairing and enhancing your images. If an 
auto fix doesn’t cut it, move on to a manual fix. If 
you’re still not happy, you can consider shooting in 
Camera Raw format, as long as your camera can do so. 
Elements has wonderful Camera Raw support, enabling 
you to process your images to your exact specifications. 
Chances are that if you can’t find the tools to correct and 
repair your images in Elements, those images are probably 
beyond salvaging.

214
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
With information in Chapter 9 and this chapter at your fingertips, try to 
employ some kind of logical workflow when you tackle the correction and 
repair of your images, such as in these steps:
 
1. Crop, straighten, and resize your images, if necessary.
 
2. After you have the images in their proper physical state, correct the 
lighting and establish good tonal range for your shadows, highlights, 
and midtones in order to display the greatest detail possible.
 
 Often, just correcting the lighting solves minor color problems. If not, 
move on to adjusting the color balance.
 
3. Eliminate any colorcasts and adjust the saturation, if necessary.
 
4. Grab the retouching tools, such as the healing tools and filters, to 
retouch any flaws.
 
5. Sharpen your image if you feel that it could use a boost in clarity and 
sharpness.
 
6. Apply any enhancements or special effects, if so desired.
 
 By following these steps and allocating a few minutes of your time, you 
should be able to get all your images in shape to print, post, and share 
with family and friends.
Adjusting Lighting
Elements has several simple, manual tools you can use to fix lighting if the 
Auto tools that we describe in Chapter 9 didn’t work or were just too, well, 
automatic for you. You’ll find that the manual tools offer more control over 
adjusting overall contrast, as well as bringing out details in shadow, mid-
tones, and highlight areas of your images. Note that all lighting adjustments 
can be found in both Full Edit and Quick Fix modes.
Fixing lighting with Shadows/Highlights
The Shadows/Highlights command offers a quick and easy method of cor-
recting over- and underexposed areas. This feature works especially well 
with images shot in bright, overhead light or in light coming from the back 
(backlit). These images usually suffer from having the subject partially or 
completely surrounded in shadows, such as the original image (left) in 
Figure 10-1.

215

Before
Adjusted with the
Shadows/Highlights command
 
Figure 10-1: Correct the lighting in your images with the Shadows/Highlights adjustment.
To use the Shadows/Highlights adjustment, follow these steps:
 
1. In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Shadows/Highlights and make sure the Preview check box is selected.
 
 When the dialog box appears, the default correction is automatically 
applied in your preview.
 
2. If the default adjustment doesn’t quite do the job, move the sliders 
(or enter a value) to adjust the amount of correction for your shadows 
(dark areas), highlights (light areas), and midtones (middle-toned 
areas).
 
 Remember that you want to try to reveal more detail in the dark and 
light areas of your image. If, after you do so, your image still looks like it 
needs more correction, add or delete contrast in your midtone areas.
 
3. Click OK to apply the adjustment and close the dialog box.
 
 If you want to start over, press Alt (Option on the Mac) and click the 
Reset button (previously the Cancel button).

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Using Brightness/Contrast
Despite its aptly descriptive moniker, the Brightness/Contrast command 
doesn’t do a great job of brightening (making an image darker or lighter) 
or adding or deleting contrast. Initially, users tend to be drawn to this com-
mand because of its appropriate name and ease of use. But, after users real-
ize its limitations, they move on to better tools with more controls, such as 
Shadows/Highlights and Levels.
The problem with the Brightness/Contrast command is that it applies the 
adjustment equally to all areas of your image. For example, you may have a 
photo that has some highlights that need darkening but all the midtones and 
shadows are perfect. The Brightness slider isn’t smart enough to recognize 
that, so when you start to darken the highlights in your image, the midtones 
and shadows also become darker. To compensate for the unwanted darken-
ing, you try to adjust the Contrast, which doesn’t fix the problem.
The moral is, if you want to use the Brightness/Contrast command, select only 
the areas that need the correction, as shown in Figure 10-2. (For more on 
selections, see Chapter 7.) After you make your selection, choose Enhance➪
Adjust Lighting➪Brightness/Contrast.
You can also find the Brightness and Contrast command in Guided mode.
 
 
 Figure 10-2: The Brightness/Contrast adjustment is best reserved for correcting selected 
areas (left) rather than the entire image (right).
Pinpointing proper contrast with Levels
If you want real horsepower when it comes to correcting the brightness and 
contrast (and even the color) in your image, look no further than the Levels 
command. Granted, the dialog box is a tad more complex than what you find 
with the other lighting and color adjustment commands, but when you under-
stand how it works, it can be downright user-friendly.

217
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
You can get a taste of what Levels can do by using Auto Levels, detailed in 
Chapter 9. The Levels command, its manual cousin, offers much more control. 
And, unlike the primitive Brightness/Contrast control, Levels enables you to 
darken or lighten 256 different tones. Keep in mind that Levels can be used 
on your entire image, a single layer, or a selected area. You can also apply the 
Levels command by using an adjustment layer, as we describe in Chapter 8.
If you’re serious about image editing, the Levels command is one tool you 
want to figure out how to use. Here’s how it works:
 
1. In Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels.
 
 We recommend using Full Edit mode for this command, where you’ll 
have access to the Info panel in Step 2.
 
 The Levels dialog box appears, displaying a histogram. This graph dis-
plays how the pixels of the image are distributed at each of the 256 
available brightness levels. Shadows are shown on the left side of the his-
togram, midtones are in the middle, and highlights are on the right. Note 
that, in addition to viewing the histogram of the composite RGB channel 
(the entire image), you can view the histogram of just the Red, Green, or 
Blue channel by selecting one of them from the Channel drop-down list.
 
 
Although you generally make changes to the entire document by using the 
RGB channel, you can apply changes to any one of an image’s component 
color channels by selecting the specific channel in the Channel pop-up 
menu. You can also make adjustments to just selected areas, which can 
be helpful when one area of your image needs adjusting and others don’t.
 
2. In Full Edit mode, choose Window➪Info to open the Info panel.
 
3. Set the black and white points manually by using the eyedroppers in 
the dialog box; first select the White Eyedropper tool and then move 
the cursor over the image.
 
4. Look at the Info panel, try to find the lightest white in the image, and 
then select that point by clicking it.
 
 The lightest white has the highest RGB values.
 
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4, using the Black Eyedropper tool and trying to 
find the darkest black in the image.
 
 The darkest black has the lowest RGB values.
 
 When you set the pure black and pure white points, the remaining pixels 
are redistributed between those two points.
 
 You can also reset the white and black points by moving the position 
of the white and black triangles on the input sliders (just below the his-
togram). Or, you can enter values in the Input Levels boxes. The three 
boxes represent the black, gray, and white triangles, respectively. Use 
the numbers 0 to 255 in the white and black boxes.

218
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
6. Use the Gray Eyedropper tool to remove any colorcasts by selecting a 
neutral gray portion of your image, one in which the Info panel shows 
equal values of red, green, and blue.
 
 If your image is grayscale, you can’t use the Gray Eyedropper tool.
 
 
If you’re not sure where there’s a neutral gray, you can also remove a 
colorcast by choosing a color channel from the Channel pop-up menu 
and doing one of the following:
 
• Choose the Red channel and drag the midtone slider to the right to 
add cyan or to the left to add red.
 
• Choose the Green channel and drag the midtone slider to the right 
to add magenta or to the left to add green.
 
• Choose the Blue channel and drag the midtone slider to the right 
to add yellow or to the left to add blue.
 
7. If your image requires it, adjust the output sliders at the bottom of the 
Levels dialog box.
 
 Moving the black triangle to the right reduces the contrast in the shad-
ows and lightens the image. Moving the white triangle to the left reduces 
the contrast in the highlights and darkens the image.
 
8. Adjust the midtones (or gamma values) with the gray triangle input 
slider.
 
 The default value for gamma is 1.0. Drag the triangle to the left to lighten 
midtones and drag to the right to darken them. You can also enter a 
value.
 
9. Click OK to apply your settings and close the dialog box.
 
 Your image should be greatly improved, as shown in Figure 10-3.
 
 
Figure 10-3: Improve the contrast of an image with the intelligent Levels command.

219
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
When you click the Auto button, Elements applies the same adjustments as 
the Auto Levels command, as we explain in Chapter 9. Note the changes and 
subsequent pixel redistribution made to the histogram after you click this 
button.
Adjusting Color
Getting the color you want sometimes seems about as attainable as win-
ning the state lottery. Sometimes, an unexpected colorcast (a shift in color) 
can be avoided at the shooting stage, for example, by using (or not using, in 
some cases) a flash or lens filter. After the fact, you can usually do a pretty 
good job of correcting the color with one of the many Elements adjustments. 
Occasionally, you may want to change the color of your image to create a 
certain special effect. Conversely, you also may want to strip out the color 
from your image altogether to create a vintage feel. Remember that all these 
color adjustments can be applied to your entire image, a single layer, or just 
a selection. Whatever your color needs, they’ll no doubt be met in Elements.
All color adjustments can be found in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, 
except for Defringe Layers, which is reserved for Full Edit mode only.
 
If you shoot your photos in the Camera Raw file format, you can open and fix 
your files in the Camera Raw dialog box. Remember that Camera Raw files 
haven’t been processed by your camera. You’re in total control of the color 
and the exposure. For more on Camera Raw, see Chapter 4.
Removing colorcasts automatically
If you ever took a photo in an office or classroom, and got a funky green tinge 
in your image, it was probably the result of the overhead fluorescent lighting. 
To eliminate this green colorcast, you can apply the Remove Color Cast com-
mand. This feature is designed to adjust the image’s overall color and remove 
the cast.
Follow these short steps to correct your image:
 
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast in either Full Edit 
or Quick Fix mode.
 
 The Remove Color Cast dialog box appears. Move the dialog box to

Guided mode.
 
2. Click an area in your photo that should be white, black, or neutral 
gray, as shown in Figure 10-4.

Figure 10-4: Get rid of nasty color shifts with the Remove Color Cast command.
 
 In our example, we clicked the sky in the image on the left.
 
 The colors in the image are adjusted according to the color you choose. 
Which color should you choose? The answer depends on the subject 
matter of your image. Feel free to experiment. Your adjustment is merely 
a preview at this point and isn’t applied until you click OK. If you goof up, 
click the Reset button, and your image reverts to its unadjusted state.
 
3. If you’re satisfied with the adjustment, click OK to accept it and close 
the dialog box.
 
If the Remove Color Cast command doesn’t cut it, try applying a photo filter 
(as we describe in the section “Adjusting color temperature with photo fil-
ters,” later in this chapter). For example, if your photo has too much green, 
try applying a magenta filter.
Adjusting with Hue/Saturation
The Hue/Saturation command enables you to adjust the colors in your image 
based on their hue, saturation, and lightness. Hue is the color in your image. 
Saturation is the intensity, or richness, of that color. And lightness controls 
the brightness value.
Follow these steps to adjust color by using the Hue/Saturation command:
 
1. In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Hue/Saturation.
 
 The Hue/Saturation dialog box appears. Be sure to select the Preview 
check box so that you can view your adjustments. Note that this com-
mand is also available in Guided mode.
 
2. Select all the colors (Master) from the Edit drop-down list or choose 
one color to adjust.

221
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
3. Drag the slider for one or more of the following attributes to adjust 
the colors as described:
 
• Hue: Shifts all the colors clockwise (drag right) or counterclock-
wise (drag left) around the color wheel.
 
• Saturation: Increases (drag right) or decreases (drag left) the rich-
ness of the colors. Note that dragging all the way to the left gives 
you the appearance of a grayscale image.
 
• Lightness: Increases the brightness values by adding white (drag 
right) or decreases the brightness values by adding black (drag left).
 
 The top color bar at the bottom of the dialog box represents the colors 
in their order on the color wheel before you make any changes. The 
lower color bar displays the colors after you make your adjustments.
 
 
When you select an individual color to adjust, sliders appear between 
the color bars so that you can define the range of color to be adjusted. 
You can select, add, or subtract colors from the range by choosing one 
of the Eyedropper tools and clicking in the image.
 
 The Hue/Saturation dialog box 
also lets you colorize images, a 
useful option for creating sepia-
colored images.
 
4. (Optional) Check the Colorize 
option to change the colors in 
your image to a new, single 
color. Drag the Hue slider 
to change the color to your 
desired hue.
 
 The pure white and black pixels 
remain unchanged, and the 
intermediate gray pixels are 
colorized.
 
Use the Hue/Saturation command, 
with the Colorize option, to create 
tinted photos, such as the one 
shown in Figure 10-5. You can also 
make selections in a grayscale image 
and apply a different tint to each 
selection. This can be especially fun 
with portraits. Tinted images can 
create vintage or moody feels, and 
can transform even mediocre photos 
into something special.

Eliminating color with Remove Color
Despite all the talk in this chapter 
about color, we realize that there may 
be times when you don’t want any 
color. With the Remove Color com-
mand, you can easily eliminate all the 
color from an image, layer, or selec-
tion. In Figure 10-6, we made a selec-
tion on the right side of the image 
and applied the Remove Color com-
mand. To use this one-step command, 
simply choose Enhance➪Adjust 
Color➪Remove Color.
 
Sometimes, stripping away color 
with this command can leave your 
image flat, or low in contrast. If this is 
the case, adjust the contrast by using 
one of Element’s many lighting fixes, 
such as Auto Levels, Auto Contrast, 
or Levels.
The Convert to Black and White command enables you to convert a selec-
tion, a layer, or an entire image to grayscale. But, rather than just arbitrarily 
strip color like the Remove Color command does, the Convert to Black and 
White command enables you to select a conversion method by first choosing 
an image style. To further tweak the results, you can add or subtract colors 
(Red, Green, or Blue) or contrast by moving the Intensity sliders until your 
grayscale image looks the way you want. Note that you aren’t really adding 
color; you’re simply altering the amount of data in the color channels. For 
more information on channels, see Chapter 2.
Switching colors with Replace Color
The Replace Color command enables you to replace designated colors 
in your image with other colors. You first select the colors you want to 
replace by creating a mask, which is a selection made by designating white 
(selected), black (unselected), and gray (partially selected) areas. See 
Chapter 8 for more details on masks. You can then adjust the hue and/or 
saturation of those selected colors.
Follow these steps to get on your way to replacing color:
 
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Replace Color.

2. Choose either Selection or Image:
 
• Selection: Shows the mask in the Preview area. The deselected 
areas are black, partially selected areas are gray, and selected 
areas are white.
 
• Image: Shows the actual image in the Preview area.
 
3. Click the colors you want to select in either the image or the Preview 
area.
 
4. Shift-click or use the plus sign (+) Eyedropper tool to add more colors.
 
5. Press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key or use the minus sign (–) 
Eyedropper tool to delete colors.
 
6. To add colors similar to the ones you select, use the Fuzziness slider 
to fine-tune your selection, adding or deleting from the selection 
based on the Fuzziness value.
 
7. Move the Hue and/or Saturation sliders to change the color or color 
richness, respectively. Move the Lightness slider to lighten or darken 
the image.
 
 Be careful to use a light hand (no pun intended) with the Lightness 
slider. You can reduce the tonal range too much and end up with a 
mess.
 
8. View the result in the Image window.
 
9. If you’re satisfied, click OK to apply the settings and close the 
dialog box.

Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Correcting with Color Curves
Elements borrowed a much-used feature from Photoshop named Curves. 
However, it added the word Color and took away some of its sophistication. 
Nevertheless, the Color Curves adjustment attempts to improve the tonal 
range in color images by making adjustments to highlights, shadows, and 
midtones in each color channel (for more on channels, see Chapter 2). Try 
using this command on images in which the foreground elements appear 
overly dark due to backlighting. Conversely, the adjustment is also designed 
to correct images that appear overexposed and washed out.
Here’s how to use this great adjustment on a selection, a layer, or an entire image:
 
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode, choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Color Curves.
 
 The Adjust Color Curves dialog box appears. Make sure to select the 
Preview check box. Move the dialog box to the side so that you can view 
the Image window while making adjustments.
 
2. Various curve adjustments appear in the Select a Style area. Select 
a style to make adjustments while viewing your image in the After 
window.
 
3. If you need greater precision, use the highlight, brightness, contrast, 
and shadow adjustment sliders, as shown in Figure 10-8, and then 
adjust the sliders as desired.
 
 The graph on the left represents the distribution of tones in your image. 
When you first access the Color Curves dialog box, the tonal range of 
your image is represented by a straight line. While you drag the sliders, 
the straight line is altered, and the tonal range is adjusted accordingly.
 
4. Click OK when you’ve adjusted the image satisfactorily.
 
5. To start over, click the Reset button.
 
 Check out Figure 10-9 for before-and-after images.
Adjusting skin tones
Occasionally, you may find that the loved ones in your photos have taken on 
a rather sickly shade of green, red, or some other non-flesh-colored tone. To 
rectify that problem, Elements has a command specifically designed to adjust 
the overall color in the image and get skin tones back to a natural shade.
Here’s how to use this feature:
 
1. Open your image in Quick Fix or Full Edit mode, select the Preview 
check box, and do one or both of the following:

• Select the layer that needs to be adjusted. If you don’t have any 
layers, your entire image is adjusted.
 
• Select the areas of skin that need to be adjusted. Only the selected 
areas are adjusted. This is a good way to go if you’re happy with 
the color of your other elements and just want to tweak the skin 
tones. For more on selection techniques, see Chapter 7.
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Color for Skin Tone.
 
 The Adjust Color for Skin Tone dialog box appears. This command is 
also found in Guided mode.
 
3. In the Image window, click the portion of skin that needs to be corrected.
 
 The command adjusts the color of the skin tone, as well as the color in 
the overall image, layer, or selection, depending on what you selected in 
Step 1.
 
4. If you’re not satisfied with the results, click another area or fiddle 
with the Skin and Ambient Light sliders:
 
• Tan: Adds or removes the amount of brown in the skin.
 
• Blush: Adds or removes the amount of red in the skin.
 
• Temperature: Adjusts the overall color of the skin, making it 
warmer (right toward red) or cooler (left toward blue).
 
5. When you’re happy with the correction, click OK to apply the adjust-
ment and close the dialog box.
 
 The newly toned skin appears, as shown in Figure 10-10.
 
 To start anew, click the Reset button. And, of course, to bail out com-
pletely, click Cancel.

Defringing layers
A telltale sign of haphazardly com-
posited images is selections with 
fringe. We don’t mean the cute kind 
hanging from your leather jacket 
or upholstery; we mean the unat-
tractive kind that consists of those 
background pixels that surround the 
edges of your selections, as shown 
in Figure 10-11. Inevitably, when you 
move or paste a selection, some of 
the background pixels are bound to 
go along for the ride. These pixels 
are referred to as a fringe or halo. 
Luckily, the Defringe command 
replaces the color of the fringe pixels with the colors of neighboring pixels 
that don’t contain the background color. In our example, we plucked the toy 
boat out of a white studio background and placed it on an image of water. 
Some of the background pixels were included in our selection and appear 
as a white fringe. When we apply the Defringe command, those white fringe 
pixels are changed to colors of nearby pixels, such as blue or red, as shown 
in Figure 10-11.
Follow these steps to defringe your selection:
 
1. In Quick Fix or Full Edit mode only, copy and paste a selection onto a 
new or existing layer, or drag and drop a selection onto a new document.
 
 For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Defringe Layer.
 
 The Defringe dialog box appears.
 
3. Enter a value for the number of pixels that needs to be converted.
 
 Try entering 1 or 2 first to see whether that does the trick. If not, you 
may need to enter a slightly higher value.
 
4. Click OK to accept the value and close the dialog box.
Correcting with Color Variations
Although we give you several ways in this chapter to eliminate colorcasts 
in an image, here’s one more. The Variations command is a digital color-
correction feature that’s been around for years and is largely unchanged. 
That’s probably because it’s one of those great features that’s easy to use 
and easy to understand, and it works. The command works by enabling you 
to make corrections by visually comparing thumbnails of color variations of 
Fringe

your image. You may use this command when you’re not quite sure what’s 
wrong with the color or what kind of colorcast your image has.
Here’s how to use the Color Variations command:
 
1. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations in Quick Fix or Full 
Edit mode.
 
 The Color Variations dialog box appears, displaying a preview of your 
original image (before) and the corrected image (after), as shown in 
Figure 10-12.
 
2. Select a tonal range or color richness (if you’re unsure which range to 
select, start with the Midtones):
 
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights: Adjusts the dark, middle, or light 
areas in the image, respectively.
 
• Saturation: Adjusts the color intensity or richness, making colors 
more intense (saturated) or less intense (desaturated). If your 
image is faded from time, be sure to increase the saturation after 
you correct any colorcast issues.
 
 Usually, just correcting the midtones is enough to get your image’s color 
in order, but if it’s not, you can always adjust the shadows and high-
lights, as well.
 
3. Specify how much adjustment you want with the Adjust Color 
Intensity slider.
 
 Drag left to decrease the amount of adjustment and drag right to 
increase the amount.
 
4. If you selected Midtones, Shadows, or Highlights in Step 2, adjust the 
color by clicking the various Increase or Decrease Color buttons.
 
 Click more than once if your initial application wasn’t sufficient to cor-
rect the problem.
 
 Be sure to keep an eye on the After thumbnail, which reflects your cor-
rections while you make them.
 
5. Click the Darken or Lighten buttons to make the colors a little darker 
or lighter, respectively.
 
6. If you selected Saturation in Step 2, click the Less Saturation or More 
Saturation buttons.
 
7. If you make a mistake — or several mistakes, for that matter — click 
the Undo button.
 
 The Color Variations dialog box supports multiple levels of undo. If you 
botch something, you can always click the Reset Image button to start 
again. Keep in mind that you can’t undo the Reset Image command after 
you click it. Click Cancel to bail entirely.

The Color Variations command is a great tool to correct those old, faded, 
green- (or some other unwanted color) tinted circa yesteryear photos. Color 
Variations allows you to easily correct the color and saturation of these 
precious, but damaged, images. Remember to either decrease the offending 
color or add the color that’s the opposite of the cast in the image. If it’s too 
red, add cyan and vice versa.
Adjusting color temperature with photo filters
Light has its own color temperature. A photo shot in a higher color tempera-
ture of light makes an image blue. Conversely, an image shot in a lower-color 
temperature makes a photo yellow. In the old days, photographers used 
to place colored glass filters in front of their camera lenses to adjust the 
color temperature of the light. They did this to either warm up or cool down 
photos, or to just add a hint of color for subtle special effects. Elements gives 
you the digital version of these filters with the Photo Filter command.

230
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
To apply the Photo Filter adjustment, follow these steps:
 
1. In Full Edit mode, choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter.
 
 The Photo Filter dialog box appears.
 
 
Note that you can also apply the photo filter to an individual layer by 
creating a photo-filter adjustment layer. For details, see Chapter 8.
 
2. In the dialog box, select Filter to choose a preset filter from the drop-
down list, or select Color to select your own filter color from the Color 
Picker.
 
 Here’s a brief description of each of the preset filters:
 
• Warming Filter (85), (81), and (LBA): Adjust the white balance in 
an image to make the colors warmer, or more yellow. Filter (81) is 
like (85) and (LBA), but it’s best used for minor adjustments. 
 
• Cooling Filter (80), (82), and (LBB): Also adjust the white balance 
that’s shown, but instead of making the colors warmer, they make 
the colors cooler, or bluer. Filter (82) is like (80) and (LBB), but it’s 
designed for slight adjustments.
 
• Red, Orange, Yellow, and so on: The various color filters adjust the 
hue, or color, of a photo. Choose a color filter to try to eliminate a 
colorcast or to apply a special effect.
 
3. Adjust the Density option to specify the amount of color applied to 
your image.
 
4. Check Preserve Luminosity to prevent the photo filter from darkening 
your image.
 
5. Click OK to apply your filter and close the dialog box.
Mapping your colors
Elements provides some commands referred to as color mappers, which 
change the colors in your image by mapping them to other values. The color 
mappers are found in the Filter➪Adjustments submenu. Figure 10-13 shows 
an example of each command, all of which are also briefly described in the 
following sections.
Equalize
This mapper first locates the lightest and darkest pixels in the image and 
assigns them values of white and black. It then redistributes all the remaining 
pixels among the grayscale values. The exact effect depends on your indi-
vidual image.

231
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
Gradient Map
This command maps the tonal range of an image to the colors of your 
chosen gradient. For example, colors (such as orange, green, and purple) 
are mapped to the shadows, highlight, and midtone areas.
 
Equalize
Gradient Map
Threshold
Posterize
Invert
 
Figure 10-13: Change the colors in your image by remapping them to other values.
Invert
This command reverses all the colors in your image, creating a kind of nega-
tive. Black reverses to white, and colors convert to their complementary 
hues (blue goes to yellow, red goes to cyan, and so on).
Threshold
Threshold makes your image black and white, with all pixels that are brighter 
than a value you specify represented as white, and all pixels that are darker 
than that value as black. You can change the threshold level to achieve differ-
ent high-contrast effects.

232
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
Posterize
This command reduces the number of colors in your image. Choose a value 
between 2 and 255 colors. Lower values create an illustrative, poster look, 
and higher values produce a more photo-realistic image.
Adjusting Clarity
After your image has the right contrast and color, and you fix any flaws (as 
we describe in Chapter 9), you’re ready to work on the overall clarity of 
that image. Although you may have fixed the nitpicky little blemishes with 
the healing tools, if your image suffers from an overall problem, like dust, 
scratches, or artifacts (blocky pixels or halos), you may need to employ the 
help of a filter. After you totally clean up your image, your last chore is to 
give it a good sharpening. Why wait until the bitter end to do so? Sometimes, 
while you’re improving the contrast and color and getting rid of flaws, you 
can reduce the clarity and sharpness of an image. So, you want to be sure 
that your image is as soft as it’s going to get before you tackle your sharpen-
ing tasks. On the other hand, also be aware that sharpening itself increases 
contrast, so depending on how much of your image you’re sharpening, 
you may need to go back and fine-tune it by using the lighting adjustments 
described in the section “Adjusting Lighting,” earlier in this chapter.
Finally, with all this talk about sharpening, we know that you may find it 
strange when we say that you may also need to occasionally blur your image. 
Blurring can be done to eliminate unpleasant patterns that occur during 
scanning, soften distracting backgrounds to give a better focal point, or even 
to create the illusion of motion.
Removing noise, artifacts, dust, and scratches
Surprisingly, the tools you want to use to eliminate junk from your images are 
found on the Filter➪Noise filter submenu in Full Edit mode. With the excep-
tion of the Add Noise filter, the others help to hide noise, dust, scratches, and 
artifacts. Here’s the list of junk removers:
 
✓ Despeckle: Decreases the contrast, without affecting the edges, to make 
the dust in your image less pronounced. You may notice a slight blurring 
of your image (that’s what’s hiding the junk), but hopefully the edges are 
still sharp.
 
✓ Dust & Scratches: Like its name says, hides dust and scratches by blur-
ring those areas of your image that contain the nastiness (it looks for 
harsh transitions in tone). Specify your desired Radius value, which is 
the size of the area to be blurred. Also, specify the Threshold value, 
which determines how much contrast between pixels must be present 
before they’re blurred.

233
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
 
Use this filter with restraint because it can obliterate detail and make 
your image go from bad to worse.
 
✓ Median: Reduces contrast around dust spots. The process the filter 
goes through is rather technical, so suffice it to say that the light spots 
darken, the dark spots lighten, and the rest of the image isn’t changed. 
Specify your desired radius, which is the size of the area to be adjusted.
 
✓ Reduce Noise: Designed to remove luminance noise and artifacts from 
your images. We used this filter to correct the original image (on the 
left) in Figure 10-14. Luminance noise is grayscale noise that makes 
images look overly grainy. Specify these options to reduce the noise in 
your image:
 
• Strength: Specify the amount of noise reduction.
 
• Preserve Details: A higher percentage preserves edges and details 
but reduces the amount of noise that’s removed.
 
• Reduce Color Noise: Remove random colored pixels.
 
• Remove JPEG Artifact: Remove the blocks and halos that can occur 
from low-quality JPEG compression.
Figure 10-14: Use the Reduce Noise filter to remove noise and artifacts.
Blurring when you need to
It may sound odd that anyone would intentionally want to blur an image. But, 
if your photo is overly grainy or suffers from a nasty moiré (wavy) pattern 
(described in the following list), you may need to blur the image to correct 
the problem. And, occasionally, you may even want to blur the background 
of an image to deemphasize distractions, or to make the foreground elements 
appear sharper and provide a better focal point.

234
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
All the blurring tools are found on the Filter➪Blur menu in Full Edit or Quick 
Fix mode, with the exception of the Blur tool, which is explained in Chapter 9:
 
✓ Average: This one-step filter calculates the average value of the image 
or selection and fills the area with that average value. You can use it for 
smoothing overly noisy areas in your image.
 
✓ Blur: Another one-step filter, this one applies a fixed amount of blurring 
to the whole image.
 
✓ Blur More: This one-step blur filter gives the same effect as Blur, but 
more intensely.
 
✓ Motion Blur: This filter mimics the blur given off by moving objects. 
Specify the angle of motion and the distance of the blur. Make sure to 
select the Preview check box to see the effect while you enter your 
values.
 
✓ Radial Blur: Need to simulate a moving Ferris wheel or some other 
round object? This filter produces a circular blur effect. Specify the 
amount of blur you want. Choose the Spin method to blur along con-
centric circular lines, as shown in the thumbnail. Or, choose Zoom to 
blur along radial lines and mimic the effect of zooming in to your image. 
Specify your desired Quality level. Because the Radial Blur filter is noto-
riously slow, Elements gives you the option of Draft (fast but grainy), 
Good, or Best (slow but smooth). The difference between Good and Best 
is evident only on large, high-resolution images. Finally, indicate where 
you want the center of your blur by moving the blur diagram thumbnail.
 
✓ Smart Blur: This filter provides several options to enable you to specify 
how the blur is applied. Specify a value for the radius and threshold, 
both defined in the following section. Start with a lower value for both 
and adjust from there. Choose a quality setting from the pop-up menu. 
Choose a mode setting. Normal blurs the entire image or selection. Edge 
Only blurs only the edges of your elements and uses black and white in 
the blurred pixels. Overlay Edge also blurs just the edges, but it applies 
only white to the blurred pixels.
 
✓ Gaussian Blur: The last Blur filter we discuss is probably the one you’ll 
use most often. It offers a Radius setting to let you adjust the amount of 
blurring you desire.
 
Use the Gaussian Blur filter to camouflage moiré patterns on scanned images. 
A moiré pattern is caused when you scan halftone images. A halftone is cre-
ated when a continuous tone image, such as a photo, is digitized and con-
verted into a screen pattern of repeating lines (usually between 85 and 150 
lines per inch) and then printed. When you then scan that halftone, a second 
pattern results and is overlaid on the original pattern. These two different 
patterns bump heads and create a nasty moiré pattern. The Gaussian Blur 
filter doesn’t eliminate the moiré — it simply merges the dots and reduces 
the appearance of the pattern. Play with the Radius slider until you get an 

235
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
acceptable trade-off between less moiré and less focus. If you happen to have 
a descreen filter built into your scanning software, you can use that, as well, 
during the scanning of the halftone image.
Sharpening for better focus
Of course, if your images don’t need any contrast, color, and flaw fixing, feel 
free to jump right into sharpening. Sometimes, images captured by a scanner 
or a digital camera are a little soft, and it’s not due to any tonal adjustments. 
Occasionally, you may even want to sharpen a selected area in your image 
just so that it stands out more.
First, let us say that you can’t really improve the focus of an image after it’s 
captured. But you can do a pretty good job of faking it. All sharpening tools 
work by increasing the contrast between adjacent pixels. This increased 
contrast causes the edges to appear more distinct, thereby giving the illusion 
that the focus is improved, as shown in Figure 10-15. Remember that you can 
also use the Sharpen tool for small areas, as described in Chapter 9. Here’s a 
description of the two sharpening commands:
 
 
 Figure 10-15: Sharpening mimics an increase in focus by increasing contrast between 
adjacent pixels.
 
✓ Unsharp Mask: Unsharp Mask, in the Enhance menu in Full Edit or Quick 
Fix mode, which gets its odd name from a darkroom technique, is the 
sharpening tool of choice. It gives you several options that enable you 
to control the amount of sharpening and the width of the areas to be 
sharpened. Use them to pinpoint your desired sharpening:
 
• Amount: Specify an amount (from 1 to 500 percent) of edge sharp-
ening. The higher the value, the more contrast between pixels 
around the edges. Start with a value of 100 percent (or less), which 
usually gives good contrast without appearing overly grainy.

236
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
• Radius: Specify the width (from 0.1 to 250 pixels) of the edges 
that the filter will sharpen. The higher the value, the wider the 
edge. The value you use is largely based on the resolution of your 
image. Low-resolution images require a smaller radius value. High-
resolution images require a higher value.
 
 Be warned that specifying a value that’s too high overemphasizes 
the edges of your image and makes it appear too “contrasty” or 
even “goopy” around the edges.
 
 
A good guideline in selecting a starting radius value is to divide your 
image’s resolution by 150. For example, if you have a 300 ppi image, 
set the radius at 2 and then use your eye to adjust from there.
 
• Threshold: Specify the difference in brightness (from 0 to 255) that 
must be present between adjacent pixels before the edge is sharp-
ened. A lower value sharpens edges with very little contrast differ-
ence. Higher values sharpen only when adjacent pixels are very 
different in contrast. We recommend leaving Threshold set at 0 unless 
your image is very grainy. Increasing the value too high can cause 
unnatural transitions between sharpened and unsharpened areas.
 
 
Occasionally, the values you enter for Amount and Radius may sharpen the 
image effectively but in turn create excess grain, or noise, in your image. 
You can sometimes reduce this noise by increasing the Threshold value.
 
✓ Adjust Sharpness: When you’re looking for precision in your image 
sharpening, Unsharp Mask is one option. The Adjust Sharpness com-
mand, as shown in Figure 10-16, is the other. This feature enables you 
to control the amount of sharpening applied to shadow and highlight 
areas. It also allows you to select from various sharpening algorithms.
 
 Here are the various options you can specify:
 
• Amount and Radius: See the two descriptions in the preceding 
Unsharp Mask bullet.
 
• Remove: Choose your sharpening algorithm. Gaussian Blur is the 
algorithm used for the Unsharp Mask command. Lens Blur detects 
detail in the image and attempts to respect the details while 
reducing the nasty halos that can occur with sharpening. Motion 
Blur tries to sharpen the blurring that occurs when you move the 
camera (or if your subject doesn’t sit still).
 
• Angle: Specify the direction of motion for the Motion Blur algo-
rithm, described in the preceding bullet.
 
• More Refined: Runs the algorithm more slowly than the default 
speed for better accuracy.

Working Intelligently with the Smart Brush tools
 
Some of the best new features to debut in Elements are the Smart Brush 
tools — Smart Brush and Detail Smart Brush. These two tools enable you to 
selectively paint on an image adjustment or special effects that appear on all 
or part of your image. What’s even more exciting is that these adjustments 
and effects are applied via an adjustment layer, meaning that they “hover” 
over your layers and don’t permanently alter the pixels in your image. It also 
means that the adjustments can be flexibly edited and deleted, if so desired.
Follow these steps to use the Smart Brush tool:
 
1. Select the Smart Brush tool in the toolbar in Full Edit mode.
 
 The tool icon looks like a house paint brush with an adjacent gear.
 
2. Choose your desired brush attributes, such as diameter and hardness, 
from the Brush Picker drop-down panel.
 
 For more on working with brushes, see Chapter 12.
 
3. Select an adjustment category and then your particular preset adjust-
ment from the Smart Paint drop-down menu in the Options bar, as 
shown in Figure 10-17.

238
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 Note that you can “tear off” this panel by grabbing the grip area in the 
upper-left corner of the panel and dragging it anywhere in your applica-
tion window. In the Smart Paint menu, you can find adjustments ranging 
from photographic effects, such as a vintage Yellowed Photo, to nature 
effects, such as Sunset (which gives a warm, orange glow to your image).
 
 
Figure 10-17: The Smart Brush enables you to paint on adjustments.
 
4. Paint an adjustment on the desired layer in your image.
 
 Note that while you paint, the Smart Brush tool attempts to detect edges 
in your image and snaps to those edges. In addition, while you brush, a 
selection border appears.
 
 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke. The accompanying layer mask also appears on that adjustment 
layer. For more on adjustment layers, see Chapter 8.
 
5. Using the Add and Subtract Smart Brush modes, fine-tune your 
adjusted area by adding and subtracting from it.
 
 When you add and subtract from your adjusted area, you’re essentially 
modifying your layer mask. Adding to your adjusted area adds white to 
your layer mask, and subtracting from your adjusted area adds black to 
your layer mask. For more on layer masks, see Chapter 8.
 
6. Select a different preset adjustment for your selected area, if you 
want.
 
 In fact, try them all out before you settle on your final choice.

239
 Chapter 10: Correcting Contrast, Color, and Clarity
 
7. If you feel you need to refine your selected area, choose select the 
Refine Edges option on the Options bar.
 
 For more on Refine Edges, See Chapter 7.
 
 If you’d rather apply the adjustment to your unselected area, select the 
Inverse option on the Options bar.
 
 If you want to modify your adjustment, double-click the Adjustment 
Layer pin on your image. The pin is annotated by a small, square black 
and red gear icon. After you double-click the pin, the dialog box cor-
responding to your particular adjustment appears. For example, if you 
double-click the Shoebox photo adjustment (under Photographic), you 
access the Hue/Saturation dialog box.
 
8. Make your necessary adjustments in the dialog box and click OK.
 
 
You can also right-click (Control-click on the Mac) and select Change 
Adjustment Settings from the context menu that appears. Or, you can 
select Delete Adjustment and Hide Selection from the same menu.
 
9. After you finish, simply deselect your selection by choosing 
Select➪Deselect.
 
You can add multiple Smart Brush adjustments. After you apply one effect, 
reset the Smart Brush tool and apply additional adjustments.
Follow these steps to work with the Detail Smart Brush tool:
 
1. Select the Detail Smart Brush tool in the toolbar in Full Edit mode.
 
 This tool shares the flyout menu with the Smart Brush tool. The tool 
icon looks like an art paint brush with an adjacent gear.
 
2. Choose a brush tip preset and brush size, and attributes from the 
Brushes drop-down panel.
 
 Feel free to change your brush tip and size as needed for your desired 
effect. For more on working with brushes, see Chapter 12. For better 
accessibility, you can “tear off” this panel (and the Smart Paint panel in 
Step 3) by grabbing the grip area in the upper-left corner of the panel 
and dragging it anywhere in your application window.
 
3. Select your desired adjustment category and then your particular 
preset adjustment from the Smart Paint drop-down menu in the 
Options bar.
 
 Several of the Special Effect adjustments are shown in Figure 10-18.

240
Part III: Selecting and Correcting Photos 
 
 
Figure 10-18: The Detail Smart Brush lets you paint on a variety of 
 
special effects.
 
4. Paint an adjustment on the desired layer in your image.
 
 A new adjustment layer is automatically created with your first paint 
stroke, along with an accompanying layer mask. For details on adjust-
ment layers and layer masks, see Chapter 8.
 
5. Follow Steps 5 through 8 in the preceding list for the Smart Brush tool.

n addition to correcting photos to improve 
their appearance, you can delve into the world 
of the Photoshop Elements artist, where you can 
use tools to draw and paint on existing photos, or 
create new, blank documents and create your own 
drawings. The tools available to you rival an art-
ist’s analog tools, and Photoshop Elements capa-
bilities are limited only by your imagination. In 
this part, you can ﬁ nd out how to apply different 
artistic effects by using many tools and customiz-
ing them for your own use, and you can get some 
helpful tips to create some dazzling images.
In addition to describing the artistic effects you 
can apply to your photos, this section tells you 
how to handle working with text. When it comes 
time for creating a poster, an advertisement, or 
some Web icons, the text features in Elements 
offer you many options for creating headline type, 
body copy, and special type effects.

A
fter giving your images a makeover — edges 
cropped, color corrected, flaws repaired, focus 
sharpened — you may want to get them all gussied 
up for a night out on the town. You can do just that 
with filters, effects, layer styles, and blend modes. 
These features enable you to add that touch of 
emphasis, drama, whimsy, or just plain goofy fun. 
We’re the first to admit that often the simplest art 
(and that includes photographs) is the best. That 
gorgeous landscape shot or the portrait that per-
fectly captures the expression on a child’s happy 
face is something you may want to leave unembel-
lished. But, for the times when a little artistic experi-
mentation is in order, turn to this chapter as your guide.
Having Fun with Filters
Filters have been around since the early days of digital imaging, when 
Photoshop was just a little bitty program. Filters, also called plug-ins because 
they can be installed or removed independently, change the look of your 

244
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
image in a variety of ways, as shown in Figure 11-1. They can correct less-
than-perfect images by making them appear sharper or by covering up flaws, 
as we describe in Chapter 10. Or they can enhance your images by making 
them appear as though they’re painted, tiled, photocopied, or lit by spot-
lights. Just make sure to create a backup of your original image if you plan on 
saving your filtered one. The following sections give you the basics on how to 
apply a filter and give you a few filtering tips.

Figure 11-1: Use filters to correct image imperfections or to completely transform images.
Applying filters
You can apply a filter in three ways:
 
✓ In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode: From the Filter menu, choose 
your desired filter category and then select a specific filter.
 
✓ In Full Edit mode only: Choose Window➪Effects to open the panel. 
Click the Filters button at the top of the panel. Select your filter category 
from the drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the panel. Double-
click the thumbnail of your desired filter or drag the filter onto your 
image window.
 
✓ In either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode: Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery to 
apply one or more filters in a flexible editing environment. The Filter 
Gallery is described in the section “Working in the Filter Gallery,” later in 
this chapter.

245
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
You can’t apply filters to images that are in Bitmap or Index Color mode. 
And some filters don’t work on images in Grayscale mode. For a refresher on 
color modes, see Chapter 3.
Corrective or destructive filters
Although there are no hard and fast rules, most digital-imaging folks classify 
filters into two basic categories, corrective and destructive:
 
✓ Corrective filters usually fix some kind of image problem. They adjust 
color, improve focus, remove dust or artifacts, and so on. Don’t get us 
wrong — pixels are still modified. It’s just that the basic appearance of 
the image remains the same, albeit hopefully improved. Two of the most 
popular corrective filters, Sharpen and Blur, are covered in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Destructive filters are used to create some kind of special effect. Pixels 
are also modified, but the image may look quite a bit different from its 
original. These kinds of filters create effects, such as textures, brush 
strokes, mosaics, lights, and clouds. They can also distort an image with 
waves, spheres, and ripples.
One-step or multistep filters
All corrective and destructive filters are either one-step filters or multistep 
filters. One-step filters have no options and no dialog boxes; select the filter 
and watch the magic happen. Multistep filters act almost like mini-applications. 
Choose the filter to open a dialog box that has options for you to specify. The 
options vary widely depending on the filter, but most come equipped with at 
least one option to control the intensity of the filter. A multistep filter appears 
on the menu with an ellipsis following its name, indicating that a dialog box fol-
lows the execution of the command.
Fading a filter
Sometimes, you don’t want the full effects of a filter applied to your image. 
Sometimes, fading a filter a bit softens the effect and makes it look less 
“computerish.” Here’s what you can do:
 
1. Choose Layer➪Duplicate Layer and then click OK when the dialog box 
appears.
 
2. Apply your desired filter to the duplicate layer.
 
3. Use the blend modes and opacity settings located on the Layers panel 
to merge the filtered layer with the original unfiltered image.

246
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
4. (Optional) With the Eraser tool, selectively erase portions of your fil-
tered image to enable the unfiltered image to show through.
 
 For example, if you applied a Gaussian Blur filter to soften a harshly lit 
portrait, try erasing the blurred portion that covers the subject’s eyes 
to let the unblurred eyes of the layer below show through. The sharply 
focused eyes provide a natural focal point.
Selectively applying a filter
Up to this point in the book, we refer to applying filters to your images. But we 
use this word rather loosely. You don’t necessarily have to apply filters to your 
entire image. You can apply filters to individual layers or even to selections. 
You can often get better effects when you apply a filter just to a portion of an 
image or layer. For example, you can blur a distracting background so that the 
person in your image gets due attention. Or, as shown in Figure 11-2, you can 
apply an Ocean Ripple or Wave filter to the ocean, leaving your surfer unfil-
tered to avoid that overly “Photoshopped” effect.
 
Corbis Digital Stock
 
Figure 11-2: Selectively applying a filter can prevent an image from looking overly manipulated.

247
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
Exercising a little restraint in applying filters usually produces a more attrac-
tive image.
Working in the Filter Gallery
When you apply a filter, don’t be surprised if you’re presented with a gar-
gantuan dialog box. This editing window, as it’s officially called, is the Filter 
Gallery. You can also access it by choosing Filter➪Filter Gallery. In the flex-
ible Filter Gallery, you can apply multiple filters, as well as edit them ad 
nauseum.
 
Even when you’re using the Filter Gallery, make a backup copy of your image, 
or at least create a duplicate layer, before you apply filters. Filters change 
the pixels of an image permanently, and when you exit the Filter Gallery, the 
filters that are applied can’t be removed.
Follow these steps to work in the Filter Gallery:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Filter Gallery in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode.
 
 The Filter Gallery editing window appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
2. In the center of the editing window, click your desired filter category 
folder.
 
 The folder expands and shows the filters in that category. A thumbnail 
displays each filter’s effect.
 
3. Select your desired filter.
 
 You get a large, dynamic preview of your image on the left side of the 
dialog box. To preview a different filter, just select it. Use the magnifica-
tion controls to zoom in and out of the preview. To hide the Filter menu 
and get a larger preview box, click the arrow to the left of the OK button.
 
4. Specify any settings associated with the filter.
 
 The preview is updated accordingly.
 
5. When you’re happy with the results, click OK to apply the filter and 
close the editing window.
 
6. If you want to apply another filter, click the New Effect Layer button 
at the bottom of the editing window.
 
 This step duplicates the existing filter.

Figure 11-3: Apply and edit multiple filters in the Filter Gallery.
 
7. Choose your desired new filter, which then replaces the duplicate in 
the Applied Filters area of the dialog box.
 
 Each of the filters you apply is displayed in the lower-right area of the 
Filter Gallery dialog box. To delete a filter, select it and click the Delete 
Effect Layer button. To edit a filter’s settings, select it from the list and 
make any changes. Keep in mind that when you edit a filter’s settings, 
the edit may affect the look of any subsequent filters you’ve applied. 
Finally, you can rearrange the order of the applied filters. Doing so 
changes the overall effect, however.
 
8. When you’re completely done, click OK to apply the filters and close 
the editing window.

 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
Distorting with the Liquify Filter
The Liquify filter is really much more than a filter. It’s a distortion that allows 
you to manipulate an image as though it were warm taffy. You can interac-
tively twist, pull, twirl, pinch, and bloat parts of your image. You can even put 
your image on a diet, as we did in Figure 11-4. You can apply this distortion 
filter on the entire image, on a layer, or on a selection. This überfilter comes 
equipped with a “mega” dialog box with its own set of tools (on the left) and 
options (on the right), as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
PhotoSpin
 
Figure 11-4: The Liquify filter enables you to interactively distort your image.

250
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Follow these steps to turn your image into a melted Dalí-esque wannabe:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Distort➪Liquify in either Full Edit or Quick Fix mode.
 
 Your image appears in the preview area.
 
2. Choose your distortion weapon of choice.
 
 You also have a number of tools to help zoom and navigate around your 
image window.
 
 Here’s a description of each tool to help you decide which to use (the 
letter in parentheses is the keyboard shortcut):
 
• Warp (W): This tool pushes pixels forward while you drag, creating 
a stretched effect. Use short strokes or long pushes.
 
• Turbulence (T): Drag to randomly jumble your pixels. Use this 
tool to re-create maelstroms of air, fire, and water with clouds, 
flames, and waves. Adjust how smooth the effect is by dragging 
the Turbulent Jitter slider in the Tool Options area. The higher the 
value, the smoother the effect.
 
• Twirl Clockwise (R) and Twirl Counterclockwise (L): These options 
rotate pixels either clockwise or counterclockwise. Place the cursor 
in one spot, hold down the mouse button, and watch the pixels under 
your brush rotate; or drag the cursor to create a moving twirl effect.
 
• Pucker (P): Click and hold or drag to pinch your pixels toward the 
center of the area covered by the brush. To reverse the pucker direc-
tion (bloat), press the Alt (Option on the Mac) key while you hold or 
drag.
 
• Bloat (B): Click, and hold or drag to push pixels toward the edge of 
the brush area. To reverse the bloat direction (pucker), press the 
Alt (Option on the Mac) key while you hold or drag.
 
• Shift Pixels (S): This tool moves pixels to the left when you drag the 
tool straight up. Drag down to move pixels to the right. Drag clock-
wise to increase the size of the object being distorted. Drag counter-
clockwise to decrease the size. To reverse any direction, press Alt 
(Option on the Mac) while you hold or drag.
 
• Reflection (M): This tool drags a reversed image of your pixels at 
a 90-degree angle to the motion of the brush. Hold down the Alt 
(Option on the Mac) key to force the reflection in the direction 
opposite the motion of the brush. This tool works well for making 
reflections on water.
 
• Zoom (Z): This tool, which works like the Zoom tool on the Elements 
Tools panel, zooms you in and out (you can zoom out by holding 
down the Alt [Option on the Mac] key when you press Z) so that 

251
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
you can better see your distortions. You can also zoom by select-
ing a magnification percentage from the pop-up list in the lower-left 
corner of the dialog box.
 
• Hand (H): This tool works like the Hand tool on the Elements Tools 
panel. Drag with the Hand tool to move the image around the pre-
view window.
 
3. Specify your options in the Tool Options area:
 
• Brush Size: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 600 
pixels to specify the width of your brush.
 
• Brush Pressure: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 
100 to change the pressure. The higher the pressure, the faster the 
distortion effect is applied.
 
• Turbulent Jitter: Drag the pop-up slider or enter a value from 1 to 
100 to adjust the smoothness when you’re using the Turbulence 
tool.
 
• Stylus Pressure: If you’re lucky enough to have a graphics tablet and 
stylus, click this option to select the pressure of your stylus.
 
4. If you get a little carried away, select the Reconstruct tool (R), and 
then hold down or drag the mouse on the distorted portions of the 
image that you want to reverse or reconstruct.
 
 Note that the reconstruction occurs faster at the center of the brush’s 
diameter. To partially reconstruct your image, set a low brush pressure 
and watch closely while your mouse drags across the distorted areas.
 
5. Click OK to apply the distortions and close the dialog box.
 
 However, if you mucked up things and want to start again, click the 
Revert button to get your original, unaltered image back. This action 
also resets the tools to their previous settings.
Correcting Camera Distortion
If you’ve ever tried to capture a looming skyscraper or cathedral in the lens 
of your camera, you know that it often involves tilting your camera and put-
ting your neck in some unnatural position. And then, after all that, what you 
end up with is a distorted view of what was an impressive building in “real 
life,” as shown with the “before” image on the left in Figure 11-5. That’s not a 
problem with Elements — now. The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes the 
distorted perspective created by both vertical and horizontal tilting of the 
camera. As a bonus, this filter also corrects other kinds of distortions caused 
by lens snafus.

252
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
 
Figure 11-5: The Correct Camera Distortion filter fixes distortions caused by camera tilt and lens flaws.
Here’s how to fix all:
 
1. Choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion in either Full Edit or Quick 
Fix mode.
 
2. In the Correct Camera Distortion dialog box, be sure to select the 
Preview option.
 
3. Specify your correction options:
 
• Remove Distortion: Corrects lens barrel, which causes your images 
to appear spherized or bloated. This distortion can occur when 
you’re using wide angle lenses. It also corrects pincushion distor-
tion, which creates images that appear to be pinched in at the 
center, a flaw that’s found when using telephoto or zoom lenses. 
Slide the slider while keeping an eye on the preview. Use the handy 
grid as your guide for proper alignment.
 
• Amount: Adjusts the amount of lightening or darkening around the 
edges of your photo that you can get sometimes from incorrect 
lens shading. Change the width of the adjustment by specifying a 
midpoint value. A lower midpoint value affects more of the image. 
Then, move the Amount slider while viewing the preview.
 
• Vertical Perspective: Corrects the distorted perspective created by 
tilting the camera up or down. Again, use the grid to assist in your 
correction. We used the Vertical Perspective to correct the build-
ing shown in Figure 11-5.

253
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
• Horizontal Perspective: Corrects halos and blurs caused by moving 
the camera (or if your subject can’t sit still). For better results, set 
the angle of movement under the Angle option.
 
• Angle: Enables you to rotate the image to compensate for tilting 
the camera. You may also need to tweak the angle slightly after 
correcting the vertical or horizontal perspective.
 
• Scale: When you correct the perspective on your image, you may 
be left with blank areas on your canvas. You can scale your image 
up or down to crop into the image and eliminate these “holes.” 
Note that scaling up results in interpolating your image up to its 
original pixel dimensions. Therefore, if you do this, be sure to start 
with an image that has a high-enough pixel dimension, or resolu-
tion, to avoid severe degradation. For more on resolution and 
interpolation, see Chapter 3.
 
• Show Grid: Shows and hides the grid, as needed. Choose the color 
of your grid lines.
 
• Zoom: Zooms in and out for your desired view.
 
4. Click OK to apply the correction and close the dialog box.
Dressing Up with Photo and Text Effects
In addition to the multitude of filters at your disposal, Elements also provides 
a lot of different effects that you can apply to enhance your photos. Note that 
some effects automatically create a duplicate of the selected layer, whereas 
other effects can work only on flattened images. (See Chapter 8 for details on 
layers.) Finally, unlike with filters, you can’t preview how the effect will look 
on your image or type, nor do you have any options to specify.
Here are the short steps to follow to apply an effect:
 
1. Select your desired image layer in the Layers panel.
 
 Or, if you’re applying the effect to just a selection, make the selection 
before applying the effect.
 
2. Choose Window➪Effects.
 
3. Select the Photo Effects button at the top of the panel.
 
4. Select your desired category of photo effects from the drop-down list 
in the upper-right area of the panel:
 
• Frame: Includes effects that enhance the edges of the layer or 
selection, as shown in Figure 11-6.

254
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
PhotoSpin
 
Figure 11-6: Enhance your images by adding effects to your image and type layers.
 
• Faded Photo, Monotone Color, Old Photo, and Vintage Photo: This 
group of effects makes your image fade from color to grayscale, 
appear as a single color, or look like an old pencil sketch or a 
photo on old paper.
 
• Misc Effects: Includes a wide variety of effects to make your image 
appear as though it’s snowing, made of lizard skin or neon tubes, 
or painted with oil pastels.
 
• Show All: Shows all the effects described in this list.
 
5. On the Effects panel, double-click your desired effect or drag the 
effect onto the image.
 
 Note that you can view your styles and effects by thumbnails or by list. 
To change the view, click More in the upper-right corner of the panel.

255
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
You can also apply an effect to type. Select your type layer and follow 
Steps 2–5 in the preceding list. Note that a dialog box alerts you that the 
type layer must be simplified before the effect can be applied. Simplifying 
the layer, of course, means you lose any text editability.
Adding Shadows, Glows, and More
Going hand in hand with filters and photo effects are layer styles. Also 
designed to enhance your image and type layers, layer styles range from 
simple shadows and bevels to the more complex styles, such as buttons and 
patterns. The wonderful thing about layer styles is that they’re completely 
nondestructive. Unlike filters, layer styles don’t change your pixel data. You 
can edit them or even delete them if you’re unhappy with the results.
Here are some important facts about layer styles:
 
✓ Layer styles can be applied only to layers. Therefore, if all you have in 
your image is a background, be sure to convert it to a layer first.
 
✓ Layer styles are dynamically linked to the contents of a layer. If you 
move or edit the contents of the layers, the results are updated.
 
✓ When you apply a layer style to a layer, an fx symbol appears next to 
the layer’s name on the Layers panel. Double-click the fx to bring up 
the Styles Settings dialog box and perform any editing that’s necessary 
to get the look you want.
Applying layer styles
Layer styles are stored in a few different libraries. You can add shadows, 
glows, beveled and embossed edges, and more complex styles, such as neon, 
plastic, chrome, and various other image effects. A sampling of styles is 
shown in Figure 11-7.
Here are the steps to apply a style and a description of each of the style 
libraries.
 
1. Select your desired image or type layer on the Layers panel.
 
2. Choose Window➪Effects.
 
3. Select the Layer Styles button at the top of the Effects panel.

256
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
4. Select your desired library of styles from the drop-down list in the 
upper-right area of the panel:
 
• Bevels: Bevels add a three-dimensional edge on the outside or 
inside edges of the contents of a layer, giving the element some 
dimension. Emboss styles make elements appear as though they’re 
raised off or punched into the page. You can change the appear-
ance of these styles, depending on the type of bevel chosen. Adjust 
parameters, such as the lighting angle, distance (how close the 
shadow is to the layer contents), size, bevel direction, and opacity.
 
• Drop and Inner Shadows: Add a soft drop or inner shadow to a 
layer. Choose from the garden-variety shadow or one that includes 
noise, neon, or outlines. You can adjust the lighting angle, dis-
tance, size, and opacity, as desired.
 
• Outer and Inner Glows: Add a soft halo that appears on the outside 
or inside edges of your layer contents. Adjust the appearance of 
the glow by changing the lighting angle, size, and opacity of the 
glow.
 
• Visibility: Click Show, Hide, or Ghosted to either display, hide, or 
partially show the layer contents. The Layer Style remains fully 
displayed.
 
• Complex and others: The remaining layer styles are a cornucopia 
of different effects ranging from simple glass buttons to the more 
exotic effects, such as Groovy and Rose Impressions. You can 
customize all these layer styles to a certain extent by adjusting the 
various settings, which are similar to those for other styles in this 
list.
 
5. On the Layer Styles panel, double-click your desired effect or drag the 
effect onto the image.
 
 The style, with its default settings, is applied to the layer. Note that layer 
styles are cumulative. You can apply multiple styles — specifically, one 
style from each library — to a single layer.
 
 To edit the style’s settings, either double-click the fx on the Layers panel 
or choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Style Settings.
 
 
 You can also apply layer styles to type layers, and the type layer doesn’t 
need to be simplified.

Working with layer styles
Here are a few last tips for working with layer styles:
 
✓ Delete a layer style or styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Clear Layer 
Style or drag the fx icon on the Layers panel to the trash can icon.
 
✓ Copy and paste layer styles onto other layers. Select the layer contain-
ing the layer style and choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Copy Layer Style. 
Select the layer or layers on which you want to apply the effect and 
choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Paste Layer Style. If it’s easier, you can also 
just drag and drop an effect from one layer to another while holding 
down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key.
 
✓ Hide or show layer styles. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Hide All Effects 
or Show All Effects.
 
✓ Scale a layer style. Choose Layer➪Layer Style➪Scale Effects. Select 
Preview and enter a value between 1 and 1,000 percent. This action 
allows you to scale the style without scaling the element.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Mixing It Up with Blend Modes
Elements sports a whopping 25 blend modes. Blend modes affect how colors 
interact between layers and also how colors interact when you apply paint 
to a layer. Not only do blend modes create interesting effects, but you can 
also easily apply, edit, or remove blend modes without touching your image 
pixels.
The various blend modes are located on a drop-down list at the top of your 
Layers panel in Full Edit mode. The best way to get a feel for the effect of 
blend modes is not to memorize the descriptions we give you in the follow-
ing sections. Instead, grab an image with some layers and apply each of the 
blend modes to one or more of the layers to see what happens. The exact 
result varies, depending on the colors in your image layers. 
General blend modes
The Normal blend mode needs 
no introduction. It’s the one you 
probably use the most. Dissolve is 
the next one on the list and, ironi-
cally, is probably the one you use 
the least (both blend modes are 
illustrated in Figure 11-8):
 
✓ Normal: The default 
mode displays each 
pixel unadjusted.
 
✓ Dissolve: This mode can be 
seen only on a layer with an 
opacity setting of less than 
100 percent. It allows some 
pixels from lower layers, 
which are randomized, to 
show through the target 
(selected) layer.
Darken blend modes
These blend modes produce effects that darken your image in various ways, 
as shown in Figure 11-9:
 
✓ Darken: Turns lighter pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are lighter than those below. If the pixels are darker, they’re unchanged.

Darken
Multiply
Color Burn

Darker Color
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 11-9: These blend modes darken your image layers.
 
✓ Multiply: Burns the target layer onto the layers underneath, thereby 
darkening all colors where they mix. When you’re painting with the 
Brush or Pencil tool, each stroke creates a darker color, as though 
you’re drawing with markers.
 
✓ Color Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer and burns 
them with color, creating a contrast effect, like applying a dark dye to 
your image.
 
✓ Linear Burn: Darkens the layers underneath the target layer by decreas-
ing the brightness. This effect is similar to Multiply but often makes 
parts of your image black.
 
✓ Darker Color: When blending two layers, the darker color of the two 
colors is visible.
Lighten blend modes
The lighten blend modes are the opposite of the darken blend modes. All 
these blend modes create lightening effects on your image, as shown in 
Figure 11-10:
 
✓ Lighten: Turns darker pixels transparent if the pixels on the target layer 
are darker than those below. If the pixels are lighter, they’re unchanged. 
This effect is the opposite of Darken.
 
✓ Screen: Lightens the target layer where it mixes with the layers under-
neath. This effect is the opposite of Multiply.
 
✓ Color Dodge: Lightens the pixels in the layers underneath the target 
layer and infuses them with colors from the top layer. This effect is 
similar to applying a bleach to your image.

✓ Linear Dodge: Lightens the layers underneath the target layer by 
increasing the brightness. This effect is similar to Screen but often 
makes parts of your image white.
 
✓ Lighter Color: When blending two layers, the lighter color of the two 
colors is visible.
Lighting blend modes
This group of blend modes plays with the lighting in your layers, as shown in 
Figure 11-11:
 
✓ Overlay: Overlay multiplies the dark pixels in the target layer and 
screens the light pixels in the underlying layers. It also enhances the 
contrast and saturation of colors.
 
✓ Soft Light: This mode darkens the dark (greater than 50 percent gray) 
pixels and lightens the light (less than 50 percent gray) pixels. The effect 
is like shining a soft spotlight on the image.
 
✓ Hard Light: This mode multiplies the dark (greater than 50 percent 
gray) pixels and screens the light (less than 50 percent gray) pixels. 
The effect is similar to shining a bright, hard spotlight on the image.
 
✓ Vivid Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent 
gray, this mode darkens the colors by increasing the contrast. If the 
pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 percent gray, the mode light-
ens the colors by decreasing the contrast.
 
✓ Linear Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent 
gray, the mode darkens the colors by decreasing the brightness. If the 
pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 percent gray, the mode light-
ens the colors by increasing the brightness.

261
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
✓ Pin Light: If the pixels on the top layer are darker than 50 percent gray, 
the mode replaces pixels darker than those on the top layer and doesn’t 
change lighter pixels. If the pixels on the top layer are lighter than 50 
percent gray, the mode replaces the pixels lighter than those on the top 
layer and doesn’t change pixels that are darker. The mode is usually 
reserved for special effects.
 
✓ Hard Mix: This mode is similar to Vivid Light but reduces the colors 
to a total of eight — cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, and 
white. This mode creates a posterized effect.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Inverter blend modes
The Inverter blend modes invert 
your colors and tend to produce 
some radical effects, as shown in 
Figure 11-12:
 
✓ Difference: Produces a 
negative effect according to 
the brightness values on the 
top layers. If the pixels on 
the top layer are black, no 
change occurs in the under-
lying layers. If the pixels on 
the top layer are white, the 
mode inverts the colors of 
the underlying layers.
 
✓ Exclusion: Like Difference, 
but with less contrast and 
saturation. If the pixels on 
the top layer are black, no change occurs in the underlying layers. If 
the pixels on the top layer are white, this mode inverts the colors of the 
underlying layers. Medium colors blend to create shades of gray.
HSL blend modes
These blend modes use the HSL (hue, saturation, lightness) color model to 
mix colors, as shown in Figure 11-13:
 
✓ Hue: Blends the luminance (brightness) and saturation (intensity of the 
color) of the underlying layers with the hue (color) of the top layer.
 
✓ Saturation: Blends the luminance and hue of the underlying layers with 
the saturation of the top layer.
 
✓ Color: Blends the luminance of the underlying layers with the saturation 
and hue of the top layer. This mode enables you to paint color while pre-
serving the shadows, highlights, and details of the underlying layers.
 
 
The Color mode is a great tool for colorizing images. If you’ve ever 
admired those hand-tinted black-and-white photos used in greeting 
cards and posters, you can create the same effect fairly easily. First, 
make sure that your black-and-white image is in RGB (red, green, blue) 
mode so that it can accept color. Create a new layer on the Layers panel 
and set it to the Color blend mode. Grab the Brush tool (with a soft-
edged tip), choose your desired color, and paint over your image. Adjust 
your opacity to less than 100 percent to create a softer effect.

✓ Luminosity: The opposite of Color, this mode blends the hue and satura-
tion of the underlying layers with the luminance of the top layer. This 
mode also preserves the shadows, highlights, and details from the top 
layer and mixes them with the colors of the underlying layers.

Using Photomerge
The awesome Photomerge features help in creating fabulous composites 
from multiple images. Whether it’s creating the perfect shot of a group of 
friends or of your favorite vacation spot without passing cars and people, the 
Photomerge feature is the go-to tool to get it done. The following sections tell 
you how each of the four Photomerge commands help to create the special 
type of composite image you need.
Photomerge Panorama
The Photomerge Panorama command enables you to combine multiple 
images into a single panoramic image. From skylines to mountain ranges, 
you can take several overlapping shots and stitch them together into one. 
To be successful at merging photos into a panorama, you need to start with 
good source files. First of all, make sure that when you shoot your photos, 
you overlap your individual images by 15 to 40 percent, but no more than 
50 percent. Then, avoid using distortion lenses (such as fish-eye) and your 
camera’s zoom setting. Also, try to keep the same exposure settings for even 
lighting. Lastly, try to stay in the same position and keep your camera at the 
same level for each photo. Using a tripod and rotating the head can help you 
get shots at the same camera level.

264
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Panorama image:
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Panorama in Full Edit mode.
 
2. In the first Photomerge dialog box, select your source files.
 
 You can select Files or Folder from the Use drop-down list.
 
3. Click Add Open Files to use all open files, or click the Browse button 
and navigate to where your files or folder are located.
 
4. Choose your desired mode under Layout.
 
 Here’s a brief description of each mode:
 
• Auto: Elements analyzes your images.
 
• Perspective: If you shot your images with perspective or at extreme 
angles, this is your mode. Try this mode if you shot your images 
with a tripod.
 
• Cylindrical: If you shot your images with a wide-angle lens or you 
have those 360-degree, full panoramic shots, this is a good mode.
 
• Reposition Only: Elements doesn’t take any distortion into account; 
it simply scans the images and positions them in the best position.
 
 If you choose any of the preceding modes, Elements opens and 
automatically assembles the source files to create the composite 
panorama in the work area of the dialog box. If it looks good, skip 
to Step 7.
 
 Elements alerts you if it can’t automatically composite your source 
files. You then have to assemble the images manually.
 
• Interactive Layout: This option opens the work area pane, as shown 
in Figure 11-14. Elements tries to align and stitch the images the 
best it can, but you may have to manually complete or adjust the 
panorama.
 
 Note that with any of the modes, Elements leaves your merged image in 
layers. You’ll also notice that a layer mask has been added to each layer 
to better blend your panoramic image. For more on layer masks, see 
Chapter 8.
 
5. If Elements hasn’t already done so for you, drag the image thumbnails 
from the lightbox area (the small white area at the top) onto the work 
area with the Select Image tool (the arrow), or simply double-click the 
lightbox thumbnail to add it to the composition.
 
6. Arrange and position your images:
 
• Select Image tool: Positions the images.
 
• Rotate Image tool: Makes rotations.

• Zoom and Move View tools: Helps view and navigate around your 
panorama.
 
• Navigator view box: Zooms into and out of your composition when 
you drag the slider.
 
• Snap to Image option: Enables overlapping images to automatically 
snap into place.
 
7. To adjust the Vanishing Point, first select the Perspective option in 
the Settings area and click your desired image with the Set Vanishing 
Point tool.
 
 Elements changes the perspective of the composition. By default, 
Elements selects the center image as the vanishing point. If necessary, 
you can move the other images.
 
 Note that when you select the Perspective setting, Elements links non–
Vanishing Point images to the Vanishing Point image. To break the link, 
click the Normal Setting button or separate the images in the work area.
 
8. Click OK to create the panorama.
 
 The file opens as a new file in Elements.

Photomerge Group Shot
We all know how hard it is to get a group of people to all look great in one 
shot. Well, Photomerge Group Shot lets you take multiple group photos and 
merge the best of them to get that perfect shot.
Here are the steps to create a Photomerge Group Shot image:
 
1. Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Group Shot in any of the Edit modes.
 
3. Take your best overall group shot and drag it from the Photo Bin onto 
the Final pane.
 
4. Select one of your other photos in the Photo Bin to use as your Source 
image. Drag it to the Source pane.
 
5. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the portions of the Source photo 
you want to merge into your Final photo, as shown in Figure 11-15.
 
 
Figure 11-15: Get the perfect group shot from several images.

 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
 You can choose to show your yellow pencil strokes or show your 
regions, which will be highlighted with a blue overlay.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with any remaining photos.
 
 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the 
Advanced Options.
 
7. With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations. Do the same on the Final 
image and choose similar locations.
 
8. Click the Align Photos button.
 
 Again, as with Photomerge Panorama, the better your starting source 
images are (similar framing, similar size), the better the merged result.
 
9. If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button.
 
10. When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
 
 The file opens as a new file in Elements.
Photomerge Faces
Photomerge Faces, more of a fun than useful tool, lets you blend features 
from multiple faces to get a kind of hybrid face.
To create a hybrid human by using the Photomerge Faces feature, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Faces in any of the Edit modes.
 
3. Choose the face you want to be your “canvas” (or starting image) and 
drag it from the Photo Bin onto the Final pane.
 
4. Select one of your other photos in the Photo Bin to use as your Source 
image. Drag it to the Source pane.
 
5. With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the 
three target markers on the eyes and mouth of the face, and then do 
the same on the Final image.
 
6. Click the Align Photos button.
 
 This command sizes the images to better match and align the fea-
tures. It’s always best to start with similarly sized and oriented images. 
Shooting the images in similar lighting helps, as well.
 
7. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the features of the Source 
photo that you want to merge into your Final photo, as shown in 
Figure 11-16.

9. When you’re satisfied with the result, click Done.
Photomerge Scene Cleaner
 
Photomerge Scene Cleaner (see Figure 11-17) sounds like a tool you might see 
in an episode of CSI to mop up a crime scene, but it isn’t quite that gory. This 
latest addition to the family of Photomerge commands enables you to create 
the optimum image by allowing you to eliminate annoying distractions, such 
as cars, passersby, and so on.

269
 Chapter 11: Playing with Filters, Effects, Styles, and More
 
Figure 11-17: Eliminate annoying distractions with Photomerge Scene Cleaner.
To get the best Source images for a “clean scene,” be sure to take multiple 
shots of your scene from the same angle and distance. It also works best 
when the elements you want to eliminate are moving.
Follow these steps to create a Photomerge Scene Cleaner composite:
 
1. Select two or more photos from your Photo Bin.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Scene Cleaner in any of the Edit 
modes.
 
 Elements attempts to auto-align your images the best it can.
 
3. Take your best overall shot of the scene and drag it from the Photo 
Bin onto the Final pane.
 
4. Select one of your other photos in the Photo Bin to use as your Source 
image. Drag it to the Source pane.
 
5. With the Pencil tool, draw a line around the elements in the Final 
photo that you want to be replaced by content from the Source photo.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 with the remaining shots of the scene.
 
 If your photos aren’t aligned, you can use the Alignment tool under the 
Advanced Options.

270
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
7. With the Alignment tool, click your Source image and position the 
three target markers on three key locations.
 
 Do the same on the Final image, choosing similar locations.
 
8. Click the Align Photos button, as shown in Figure 11-17.
 
 Again, as with the other Photomerge commands, the more similar your 
starting source images are (similar framing, similar angle), the better the 
merged result.
 
9. If you make a mess of things, click the Reset button.

Drawing and Painting
In This Chapter

▶ Drawing with the Elements Pencil tool
▶ Painting with the Elements Brush tool
▶ Filling and outlining your selections
▶ Pouring color with the Paint Bucket tool
▶ Creating gradients and patterns
▶ Creating and editing shapes of all sorts
E
lements is such a deluxe, full-service image editing program that it 
doesn’t just stop at giving you tools to select, repair, organize, and share 
your images. It figures that you may need to add a swash of color, 
either freeform with a brush or pencil, or in the form of a geo-
metric or organic shape. Don’t worry: This drawing and 
painting business isn’t just for those with innate artistic 
talent. In fact, Elements gives you plenty of preset 
brushes and shapes that you can use. If you can pick 
a tool and drag your mouse, you can draw and paint.
Choosing Color
Before you start drawing or painting, you may want 
to change your color to something other than the 
default black. If you’ve read the earlier chapters in 
this book, we’re sure that you checked out the Elements 
Tools panel and noticed the two overlapping color 
swatches at the bottom of the panel. These two swatches rep-
resent two categories of color: foreground and background. Here’s 
a quick look at how they work with different tools:

272
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
✓ When you add type, paint with the Brush tool, or create a shape, you’re 
using the foreground color.
 
✓ On the background layer of an image, when you erase with the Eraser 
tool, or when you increase the size of your canvas, you’re accessing the 
background color.
 
✓ When you drag with the Gradient tool, as long as your gradient is set to 
the default, you’re laying down a blend of color from the foreground to 
the background.
Elements gives you three ways to choose your foreground and background 
colors: the Color Picker; the Color Swatches panel; and the Eyedropper 
tool, which samples color in an image. In the following sections, we explore 
each one.
Working with the Color Picker
By default, Elements uses a black foreground color and a white background 
color. If you’re experimenting with color and want to go back to the default 
color, press the D key. If you want to swap between foreground and back-
ground colors, press the X key. If you want any other color of the rainbow, 
click your desired swatch to change either the foreground or background 
color. This action transports you to the Color Picker, as shown in Figure 12-1.
Here are the steps to choose your color via the Color Picker:
 
1. Click either the Foreground or Background color swatch on the Tools 
panel.
 
 The Color Picker appears.
 
2. Drag the color slider or click the color bar to get close to the general 
color you desire.
 
3. Choose the exact color you want by clicking in the large square, or 
color field, on the left.
 
 The circle cursor targets your selected color. The two swatches in the 
upper-right corner of the dialog box represent your newly selected color 
and the original foreground or background color.
 
 The numeric values on the right side of the dialog box also change 
according to the color you selected. If you happen to know the values 
of your desired color, you may also enter them in the text boxes. 
Remember that RGB (red, green, blue) values are based on brightness 
levels, from 0 (black) to 255 (white). You can also enter HSB (hue, satu-
ration, brightness) values or the hexadecimal formula for Web colors.
 
4. When you’re happy with your color, click OK.

Figure 12-1: The Color Picker.
Dipping into the Color Swatches panel
Another way Elements enables you to choose a foreground or background 
color is by selecting a color on the Color Swatches panel. The Color Swatches 
panel is a digital version of the artist’s paint pal-
ette. In addition to preset colors, you can mix 
and store your own colors for use now and later. 
You can have several panels for certain types of 
projects or images. For example, you may want 
a panel of skin tones for retouching portraits. 
Choose Window➪Color Swatches to bring up the 
panel, as shown in Figure 12-2.
To grab a color from the Color Swatches panel, 
click the color swatch you want. By the way, it 
doesn’t matter which tool you have. As soon as 
you move the tool over the panel, it temporarily 
converts to an eyedropper that samples the color 
and makes it your new foreground or background 
color.
Figure 12-2: The Color 
Swatches panel.

274
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
Although the Color Swatches panel is a breeze to use, here are a few tips to 
help you along:
 
✓ Change the background color. Either first select the background swatch 
on the Tools panel or Ctrl-click (Ô-click on the Mac) a swatch.
 
✓ Use preset colors. To load a particular preset swatch library, select it 
from the Color Swatches panel drop-down list. Elements offers libraries 
specific to Web graphics, photo filters, and Windows systems.
 
✓ Add a color to the Color Swatches panel. To add a color to the 
Swatches panel, choose New Swatch from the More pop-up menu. 
You can also simply click in an empty portion of the panel. Name your 
swatch and click OK.
 
✓ Save swatches. Choose Save Swatches from the More pop-up menu in 
the upper-right corner of the panel. We recommend saving the swatch 
library in the default Color Swatches folder in the Presets folder. If by 
chance this folder doesn’t come up by default, just navigate to the Color 
Swatches folder by following this partial path: Adobe\Photoshop 
Elements 7.0\Presets\Color Swatches.
 
✓ Load swatches. If you want to load a custom library created by you or 
by someone else, choose More➪Load Swatches. In the dialog box, select 
your desired library from the Color Swatches folder. The new library is 
appended (added) to your current library.
 
 You can also work with swatches by using the Preset Manager. For more 
on the Preset Manager, see Chapter 2.
 
✓ Delete swatches. To delete a swatch, drag it to the trash can at the 
bottom of the panel or Alt-click (Option-click on the Mac) the swatch.
 
✓ Change the panel’s appearance. Click the More button in the upper-
right corner to choose from Small or Large Thumbnail (swatch squares) 
or Small or Large List (swatch squares with a name).
 
✓ Replace your current swatch library with a different library. Choose 
Replace Swatches from the More pop-up menu. Choose a library from 
the Color Swatches folder.
Sampling with the Eyedropper tool
Another way that Elements enables you to choose color is via the 
Eyedropper tool. The Eyedropper tool comes in handy when you want to 
sample an existing color in an image and use it for another element. For 
example, you may want your text to be the same color as the green back-
ground in the image shown in Figure 12-3. Grab the Eyedropper tool (or 
press I ) and click a shade of green in the background. The tool samples the 
color and makes it your new foreground color. You can then create the type 
with your new foreground color.

275
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
 
Corbis Digital Stock
 
Figure 12-3: The Eyedropper tool enables you to sample color from your image to 
 
use with other elements, such as type.
Here are a few things to remember when you’re using the Eyedropper tool:
 
✓ Sample a new foreground or background color. Obviously, you can 
select either the foreground or background swatch on the Tools panel 
before you sample a color. But if the foreground color swatch is active, 
holding down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key samples a new back-
ground color, and vice versa.
 
✓ Choose a color from any open image. If you have multiple images open, 
you can even sample a color from an image that you’re not working on!
 
✓ Choose your sample size on the Options bar. You can select the color 
of just the single pixel you click (Point Sample), or Elements can average 
the colors of the pixels in a 3-x-3- or 5-x-5-pixel area.
 
✓ Make colors Web safe. If you right-click your image to bring up the con-
text menu, you have a hidden option: Copy Color as HTML. This option 

276
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
provides the Web hexadecimal color formula for that sampled color 
and copies it to the Clipboard. You can then paste that formula into an 
HTML file or grab the Type tool and choose Edit➪Paste to view the for-
mula in your image.
 
✓ Toggle between the Eyedropper and other tools. Elements, multitasker 
that it is, enables you to temporarily access the Eyedropper tool when 
you’re using the Brush, Pencil, Color Replacement, Gradient, Paint 
Bucket, Cookie Cutter, or Shape tools. Simply press the Alt (Option on 
the Mac) key to access the Eyedropper. Release the Alt (Option on the 
Mac) key to go back to your original tool.
Getting Artsy with the Pencil and Brush Tools
If you’ve read the first part of this chapter and have been thoroughly doused 
with every way to choose a color, you probably want to find out how to paint 
and draw with that color. The Pencil and Brush tools give you the power to 
put your creative abilities to work, and the following sections show you how.
 
When you use these two tools, you benefit immensely from the use of a 
pressure-sensitive digital drawing tablet. The awkwardness of trying to 
draw or paint with a mouse disappears and leaves you with tools that 
behave much closer to their analog ancestors.
Drawing with the Pencil tool
Drawing with the Pencil tool creates hard edges. 
You can’t get the soft, feathery edges that you 
can with the Brush tool. In fact, the edges of a 
pencil stroke can’t even be anti-aliased. (For 
more on anti-aliasing, see the following section.) 
Keep in mind that if you draw anything other 
than vertical or horizontal lines, your lines will 
have some jaggies when they’re viewed up close. 
But hey, don’t diss the Pencil just yet. Those 
hard-edged strokes can be perfect for Web 
graphics. What’s more, the Pencil tool can erase 
itself, and it’s great for digital sketches, as shown 
in Figure 12-4.
Follow these steps to become familiar with the 
Pencil tool:
 
1. Select the Pencil tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the N key. By default, the 
Pencil tool’s brush tip is the 1-pixel brush. Yes, even though the Pencil 
tip is hard-edged, we still refer to it as a brush.

2. On the Options bar, choose your desired pencil options, beginning 
with a brush preset. Click the arrow and select your desired brush 
from the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.
 
 To load another preset library, click the Brushes menu at the top of the 
panel.
 
 Remember that you aren’t limited to the standard old brush strokes. 
Check out the Assorted and Special Effects brushes, found in the 
Brushes drop-down list on the Brushes panel. You’ll be surprised at 
some of the interesting brushes lurking on these panels. Use them to 
create standalone images or to enhance your photographic creations.
 
 Access the pop-up menu on the Brushes panel to save, rename, or delete 
individual brushes and also save, load, and reset brush libraries. For 
more on these operations, see the following section.
 
3. Choose your brush size.
 
 A preset brush’s pixel diameters are shown as text below a thumbnail 
image of the brush shape. If you want to change the size of that brush 
tip, drag the Size slider or enter a value.
 
4. Select a blending mode.
 
 Blend modes alter the way the color you’re applying interacts with 
the color on your canvas. You can find more about blend modes in 
Chapter 11.
 
5. If you want the background to show through your strokes, adjust the 
opacity by dragging the slider or entering an Opacity percentage less 
than 100 percent.
 
 The lower the percentage, the more the background images show 
through.
 
 Your strokes must be on a separate layer above your images for you to 
be able to adjust the opacity and blend modes after you draw them. For 
more on layers, see Chapter 8.
 
6. Select Auto Erase if you want to enable that option.
 
 This option removes portions of your pencil strokes. For example, say 
that your foreground color is black and your background color is white, 
and you apply some black strokes. With Auto Erase enabled, you apply 
white if you drag back over the black strokes. If you drag over the white 
background, you apply black.
 
7. Click and drag with the mouse to create your freeform lines.
 
 To draw straight lines, click at a starting point, release the mouse 
button, and then Shift-click at a second point.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Painting with the Brush tool
The Brush tool creates soft-edged strokes. How soft those strokes are 
depends on which brush you use. By default, even the hardest brush has a 
slightly soft edge because it’s anti-aliased. Anti-aliasing creates a single row 
of partially filled pixels along the edges to produce the illusion of a smooth 
edge. You can also get even softer brushes, which employ feathering. For 
details on feathering, see Chapter 7.
The Brush tool shares most of the options found in the Pencil tool, except 
that the Auto Erase feature isn’t available. Here’s the lowdown on the unique 
Brush options:
 
✓ Airbrush: Click the Airbrush 
button on the Options bar to 
apply the Airbrush mode. In 
this mode, the longer you hold 
down the mouse button, the 
more paint the Brush pumps 
out and the wider the airbrush 
effect spreads.
 
✓ Tablet Options: If you’re using 
a pressure-sensitive digital 
drawing tablet, check the set-
tings you want the tablet to 
control, including size, scatter, 
opacity, roundness, and hue 
jitter. The harder you press 
with the stylus, the greater the 
effect of these options.
 
✓ More Options: Click the brush 
icon to access additional 
options. These options, 
referred to as brush dynamics, 
change while you apply your stroke. See Figure 12-5 for an example of 
each one. These options include
 
• Fade: The lower the value, the quicker the stroke fades. Zero, how-
ever, creates no fade.
 
• Hue Jitter: Vary the stroke between the foreground and background 
colors. The higher the value, the more frequent the variation.
 
• Scatter: The higher the value, the higher the number of brush 
marks and the farther apart they are.
 
• Spacing: The higher the number, the more space between marks.
 
• Hardness: The higher the value, the harder the brush.

 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
• Angle: If you create an oval brush by adjusting the roundness (see 
the following bullet), this option controls the angle of that oval 
brush stroke. It’s so much easier to drag the points and the arrow 
on the diagram than to “guesstimate” values in the text boxes.
 
• Roundness: A setting of 100 percent is totally circular. The lower 
the percentage, the more elliptical your brush becomes.
 
 
 You can lock in these brush dynamics by selecting the Keep These 
Settings for All Brushes check box, ensuring that every brush you select 
adopts these settings.
Like the Pencil tool, additional features for the Brush tool appear in the 
pop-up list on the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel. Here’s a quick 
description of each:
 
✓ Save Brush: Allows you to save a custom brush as a preset. See the fol-
lowing section for details.
 
✓ Rename Brush: Don’t like your brush’s moniker? Change it with this 
option.
 
✓ Delete Brush: Don’t like your entire brush? Eliminate it with this option.
 
✓ Reset Brushes: Reverts your current brush library to the default.
 
✓ Save Brushes: Saves custom brushes in a separate library.
 
✓ Load Brushes: Loads a preset or custom brush library.
 
✓ The display options: Not a single command, but rather a set of com-
mands that enable you to change the way your brush tips are displayed. 
The default view is Stroke Thumbnail, which displays the appearance 
of the stroke. These commands include Text Only, Small and Large 
Thumbnail, and Small and Large List.
You can also manage brush tip libraries by using the Preset Manager. See 
Chapter 2 for information on using the Preset Manager.
Creating your own brush
After playing with all the various options, if you really like the Franken-brush 
you’ve created, feel free to save it as a preset that you can access again in the 
future. Choose Save Brush from the pop-up menu on the Brush Preset Picker 
panel. Name the brush and click OK. Your new custom brush shows up at the 
bottom of the Brush Preset Picker drop-down panel.
There’s one additional way to create a brush. Elements allows you to create 
a brush from all or part of your image. The image can be a photograph or 
something you’ve painted or drawn.

280
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Here’s how to create a brush from your image:
 
1. Select part of your image with any of the selection tools.
 
 If you want to use the entire image or entire layer, deselect everything.
 
 For more on selections, see Chapter 7.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Define Brush or Edit➪Define Brush from Selection.
 
 You see one command or the other, depending on what you do in Step 1.
 
3. Name the brush and click OK.
 
 The new brush shows up at the bottom of your Brush Preset Picker 
drop-down panel. Note that your brush is only a grayscale version of 
your image. When you use the brush, it automatically applies the color 
you’ve selected as your foreground color, as shown in Figure 12-6.
 
Digital Vision

Using the Impressionist Brush
In this section, we introduce the Impressionist Brush. This tool is designed to 
paint over your photos in a way that makes them look like fine art paintings. 
You can set various options that change the style of the brush strokes.
Here’s how to use this artistic brush:
 
1. Select the Impressionist Brush from the Tools panel.
 
 It looks like a brush with a curlicue next to it. You can also press B, or 
Shift+B, to cycle through the brushes.

281
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
2. Set your brush options.
 
 The Brushes, Size, Mode, and 
Opacity options are identical 
to those found with the Brush 
tool, described in the section 
“Painting with the Brush tool,” 
earlier in this chapter. You can 
also find some unique options 
on the More Options panel, 
indicated by the Impressionist 
Brush icon:
 
• Style: This drop-down list 
contains various brush 
stroke styles, such as Dab 
and Tight Curl.
 
• Area: Controls the size of 
your brush stroke. The 
larger the value, the larger 
the area covered.
 
• Tolerance: Controls how 
similar color pixels have to 
be before they’re changed 
by the brush stroke.
 
3. Drag on your image and paint 
with your brush strokes, as 
shown in Figure 12-7.
 
 The best way to get a feel for what this tool does is to open your favorite 
image, grab the tool, and take it for a test drive.
Filling and Outlining Selections
There may be times when you want to create an element on your canvas 
that can’t quite be created with a brush or pencil stroke. Maybe it’s a perfect 
circle or a five-point star. Elements offers a couple of ways to create these 
objects. If you have a selection, you can fill or stroke that selection to create 
that element, rather than draw or paint it on. The Fill command adds a color 
or a pattern to the entire selection, whereas the Stroke command applies the 
color to only the edge of the selection border.
Fill ’er up
You won’t find a Fill tool on the Tools panel. Elements decided to avoid the 
overpopulated panel and placed the Fill and Stroke commands on the Edit 
menu. Here are the simple steps to fill a selection:
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 12-7: The Impressionist Brush turns 
your photo into a painting.

282
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
1. Grab the selection tool of your choice and create your selection on a 
new layer.
 
 Although you don’t have to create a new layer to make a selection to fill, 
we recommend it. That way, if you don’t like the filled selection, you can 
delete the layer, and your image or background below it remains safe. 
See Chapter 7 for more on selections and Chapter 8 for details on work-
ing with layers.
 
2. Select either the foreground or background color and then choose a 
fill color.
 
 See “Choosing Color,” earlier 
in this chapter, if you need a 
refresher.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection.
 
 The Fill Layer dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 12-8, appears.
  
 If you want to bypass the Fill 
Layer dialog box (and the rest 
of these steps), you can use 
these handy keyboard shortcuts 
instead:
 
• To fill the selection with 
the foreground color: 
Press Alt+Backspace 
(Option+Delete on the 
Mac).
 
• To fill it with the background color: Press Ctrl+Backspace (Ô+Delete 
on the Mac).
 
4. Choose your desired fill from the Use pop-up menu.
 
 You can select whether to fill with the foreground or background color. 
You also can choose Color, Black, 50% Gray, White, or Pattern. If you 
select Color, you’re transported to the Color Picker. If you choose 
Pattern, you must then choose a pattern from the Custom Pattern 
drop-down panel. For more on patterns, see the section “Working with 
Patterns,” later in this chapter.
 
 If you don’t have an active selection border in your image, the command 
says Fill Layer and your entire layer is filled with your color or pattern.
 
5. In the blending area, you can specify whether to preserve transpar-
ency, which enables you to fill only the portions of the selection that 
contain pixels (the nontransparent areas).
Figure 12-8: Fill your selection or layer with 
color or a pattern.

283
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
 
 Although you can also choose a blend mode (how the fill color interacts 
with colors below it) and opacity percentage, we urge you not to adjust 
your blend mode and opacity in the Fill Layer dialog box. Make those 
adjustments on your layer later, by using the Layer panel commands, 
where you have more flexibility for editing.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The color or pattern fills the selection.
Outlining with the Stroke command
Stroking a selection enables you to create colored outlines, or borders, of 
selections or layers. You can put this border inside or outside the selection 
border or centered on it. Here are the steps to stroke a selection:
 
1. Choose a foreground color and make a selection.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Stroke (Outline) Selection.
 
 The Stroke dialog box opens.
 
3. Select your desired settings.
 
 Many settings are the same as those found 
in the Fill Layer dialog box, as we explain 
in the preceding section. Here’s a brief 
rundown of the options that are unique to 
strokes:
 
• Width: Enter a width of 1 to 250 pixels 
for the stroke.
 
• Location: Specify how Elements should 
apply the stroke: outside the selection, 
inside the selection, or centered on the 
selection.
 
4. Click OK to apply the stroke.
 
 We gave a 30-pixel centered stroke to our selection, as shown in 
Figure 12-9.
Splashing On Color with the Paint Bucket Tool
The Paint Bucket tool has been a longtime occupant of the Tools panel. This 
tool, whose icon looks just like a bucket, behaves like a combination of the 
Fill command and the Magic Wand tool. It makes a selection based on simi-
larly colored pixels and then immediately fills that selection with color or a 
pattern. Just like the Magic Wand tool, this tool is the most successful when 
you have a limited number of colors, as shown in Figure 12-10.
Figure 12-9: Stroke a selection 
to create a colored border.

284
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
To use the Paint Bucket tool, simply click inside 
the selection you want to fill. Before you click, 
however, specify your options:
 
✓ Fill: Choose between a fill of the foreground 
color or a pattern. If you want to use the 
foreground color, leave Pattern unchecked.
 
✓ Pattern: If you select Pattern, select a preset 
pattern from the drop-down panel. For more 
details on patterns, see the section “Working 
with Patterns,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Mode: Select a blending mode to change 
how your fill color interacts with the color 
below it.
 
✓ Opacity: Adjust the opacity to make your fill 
more or less transparent.
 
✓ Tolerance: Choose a tolerance level that 
specifies how similar in color a pixel must be 
before it’s selected and then filled. The lower the value, the more similar 
the color must be. For more on tolerance, see the section on the Magic 
Wand in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Anti-Alias: Choose this option to smooth the edges between the filled 
and unfilled areas.
 
✓ Contiguous: If selected, this option selects and fills only pixels that are 
touching within your selection. If the option is unselected, pixels are 
selected and filled wherever they lie within your selection.
 
✓ All Layers: This option selects and fills pixels within the selection in all 
layers that are within your tolerance level.
Working with Multicolored Gradients
If one color isn’t enough for you, you’ll be pleased to know that Elements 
enables you to fill a selection or layer with a gradient. A gradient is a blend 
of two or more colors that gradually dissolve from one to another. Elements 
provides a whole slew of various preset gradients. But creating your own 
custom gradient is also fun and easy.
Applying a preset gradient
Similar to colors, patterns, and brushes, gradients have a whole slew of pre-
sets that you can apply to your selection and layers. You can also load other 
libraries of gradients from the Gradient panel pop-up menu.
Corbis Digital Stock
Figure 12-10: The Paint Bucket 
tool makes a selection and fills 
it at the same time.

285
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Here’s how to apply a preset gradient:
 
1. Make the selection you want to fill with a gradient.
 
 We recommend making the selection on a new layer so that you can edit 
the gradient later without harming the underlying image.
 
 If you don’t make a selection, the gradient is applied to the entire layer 
or background.
 
2. Select the Gradient tool from the 
Tools panel or press the G key.
 
3. On the Options bar, click the down-
pointing arrow on the Gradient 
Picker drop-down panel and 
choose a preset gradient.
 
 Remember that you can choose 
other preset libraries from the panel 
pop-up menu. Libraries, such as 
Color Harmonies and Metals, con-
tain interesting presets.
 
4. Choose your desired gradient type 
by clicking one of the icons.
 
 See Figure 12-11 for an example of 
each type.
 
5. Choose from the following addi-
tional options on the Options bar:
 
• Mode: Select a blending mode 
to change how the color of 
the gradient interacts with the 
colors below it.
 
• Opacity: Specify how opaque 
or transparent the gradient is.
 
• Reverse: Reverse the order in 
which the colors are applied.
 
• Dither: Add noise, or random information, to produce a smoother 
gradient that prints with less banding (weird stripes caused by 
printing limitations).
 
• Transparency: Deselect this option to make Elements ignore any 
transparent areas in the gradient, making them opaque instead.
 
6. Position your gradient cursor at your desired starting point within 
your selection or layer.
 
7. Drag in any direction to your desired end point for the gradient.

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
 Longer drags result in a subtler 
transition between colors, 
whereas shorter drags result in 
a more abrupt transition. Hold 
down the Shift key to restrain 
the direction of the gradient to 
a 45-degree angle.
 
8. Release the mouse button to 
apply the gradient.
 
 We applied an Orange Yellow 
radial gradient from the Color 
Harmonies 2-preset library to 
a selection of a sun in Figure 
12-12. We selected the Reverse 
option and dragged from the 
center of the sun to the tip of 
the top ray.
Customizing gradients
If you can’t find the exact gradient you need, you can easily create your own. 
The Gradient Editor lets you create your own custom gradient using as many 
colors as you want. After you create a custom gradient, you can save it as a 
preset to reuse in the future.
Follow these steps to create a custom gradient:
 
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Click the Edit button on the Options bar.
 
 The Gradient Editor dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-13.
 
3. Pick an existing preset to use as the basis for your new gradient.
 
4. Choose your gradient type, either Solid or Noise, from the pop-up 
menu.
 
 A Noise gradient contains random colors. Interestingly, each time you 
create a Noise gradient, the result is different.
 
 Note that as soon as you start to edit the existing gradient, the name of 
the gradient changes to Custom.
 
5. Choose your options for either a Solid or Noise gradient, depending 
on what you chose in Step 4:

Figure 12-13: Use the Gradient Editor to edit and customize 
 
gradients.
 
• If you chose Solid: Adjust the Smoothness percentage to determine 
how smoothly one color blends into another.
 
• If you chose Noise: You can choose which Color Model to use to 
set the color range. You can also adjust the Roughness, which 
affects how smoothly or abruptly the color transitions from one to 
another. Click Restrict Colors to avoid oversaturated colors. The 
Add Transparency option adds transparency to random colors. 
Click the Randomize button to randomly generate a new gradient. 
You can then skip to Step 15 to finish the gradient-making process.
 
6. If you’re creating a solid gradient, begin choosing the first color of 
your gradient by first clicking the left color stop under the gradient 
bar (refer to Figure 12-13).
 
 The triangle on top of the stop turns black to indicate that you’re work-
ing with the starting point of the gradient.

288
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
7. Choose the starting color by double-clicking the left color stop and 
selecting a color from the Color Picker that appears.
 
 In the Stops area, you can also click the color swatch or choose 
Foreground, Background, or User Color from the Color pop-up menu. If 
you select Color with the Foreground or Background option when you 
change either of those colors, the color in the gradient changes auto-
matically for gradients you make. However, when you open the Gradient 
Editor again, you can revert to your original foreground or background 
color by selecting the User Color option.
 
8. Select the ending color by clicking the right color stop. Repeat Step 7 
to define the color.
 
9. Change the percentage of the amount of one color versus the other 
by moving the starting or ending point’s color stop to the left or right. 
Drag the midpoint slider (a diamond icon) to adjust where the colors 
mix equally, 50-50.
 
 You can also change the position of the midpoint by typing a value in 
the Location box.
 
10. To add another color, click below the gradient bar at the position you 
want to add the color. Define a color in the same way you did in Step 7.
 
11. Repeat Step 10 to add colors.
 
12. To add transparency to your gradient, select an opacity stop (refer to 
Figure 12-13) and adjust the Opacity slider to specify the amount of 
transparency you desire.
 
 By default, a gradient has colors that are 100-percent opaque. You can 
fade a gradient to transparency so that the portion of the image under 
the gradient shows through.
 
 You can also add additional opacity stops in the same way you add 
color stops.
 
13. Adjust your color and opacity stops and their midpoint sliders to vary 
the percentages of each color.
 
14. You can also redefine any of the colors. To delete a color stop, drag it 
up or down off the gradient bar.
 
15. When you’re done, name your gradient and click the New button.
 
 Your gradient is added to the Presets menu.
 
After all that work, you may want to consider saving your gradients for later 
use. To save a gradient, click the Save button in the Gradient Editor dialog 
box. Save the current presets, with your new gradient, under the current 
library’s name or a new name altogether. You can then later load that preset 
library. You can also manage your gradient presets with the Preset Manager, 
as we explain in Chapter 2.

 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
Working with Patterns
If you’ve ever seen someone wearing leopard-print pants with an argyle 
sweater and a plaid blazer, you’re familiar with patterns. Not always pretty 
when used without restraint, patterns can be used to occasionally fill selec-
tions or layers. You can also stamp your image by using the Pattern Stamp 
tool. You can even retouch by using a pattern with the Healing Brush tool. 
Elements offers a lot of preset patterns to keep you happy. And, if you’re not 
happy with Elements’ selection, you can create your own, of course.
Applying a preset pattern
Although you can apply patterns by using many different tools, this chapter 
sticks with applying patterns as fills. To fill a layer or selection with a preset 
pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the layer or selection 
you want to fill with a pattern.
 
 Again, we recommend making 
your selection on a new layer 
above your image for more flex-
ible editing later on.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Fill Selection or 
Fill Layer and choose Pattern 
from the Use drop-down menu.
 
3. Click the down-pointing arrow 
and select a pattern from the 
Custom Pattern drop-down 
panel, as shown in Figure 12-14.
 
 If you don’t see a pattern to 
your liking, choose another 
preset library by clicking the 
panel pop-up menu and choos-
ing another preset library at the bottom of the submenu.
 
4. Choose any other fill options you want to apply, such as Mode, 
Opacity, or Preserve Transparency.
 
 For details on these options, see the section “Filling and Outlining 
Selections,” earlier in this chapter.
 
5. Click OK to fill the layer or selection with the chosen pattern.
Figure 12-14: Fill your selection with one of the 
many Elements preset patterns.

290
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Creating a new pattern
You may someday want to create your own pattern. Patterns can be easily 
created from any existing photo or painting you create in Elements. You can 
even scan your signature or logo, define it as a pattern, and use it with the 
Pattern Stamp tool to sign all your work.
To create your own pattern, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the photographic, painted, or scanned image that contains the 
area you want to use as a pattern.
 
2. Use the Rectangular Marquee tool to select the area you want to con-
vert into a pattern.
 
 Make sure that your Feather option is set to 0.
 
 If you don’t make a selection, Elements uses your entire layer as a basis 
for the pattern.
 
3. Choose Edit➪Define Pattern from Selection or Edit➪Define Pattern.
 
4. Enter a name for your pattern in the Pattern Name dialog box that 
appears.
 
 Your new pattern now appears in every Pattern panel, wherever it may 
lurk in Elements.
In addition to filling your selection with a pattern, you can stamp on a pattern 
with the Pattern Stamp tool. For details, see Chapter 9.
Creating Shapes of All Sorts
In this section, we leave the land of pixels and head into uncharted territory — 
Vectorville. Before we discuss the ins and outs of creating shapes, here’s a 
little overview that explains the difference between pixels and vectors:
 
✓ Pixel images describe a shape in terms of a grid of pixels. When you 
increase the size of a pixel-based image, it loses quality and begins to 
look blocky, mushy, and otherwise nasty. For more details on resizing 
pixel-based images and the ramifications of doing so, see Chapter 3.
 
✓ Vectors describe a shape mathematically. The shapes comprise paths 
made up of lines, curves, and anchor points. Because vector shapes are 
math-based, you can resize them without any loss of quality whatsoever.
In Figure 12-15, you can see both types of images.

291
 Chapter 12: Drawing and Painting
When you create a shape in Elements, you’re cre-
ating a vector-based element. Shapes reside on 
a special kind of layer called, not surprisingly, a 
shape layer. Use shapes to create simple logos, 
Web buttons, and other small spot illustrations.
Drawing a shape
Elements offers an assortment of shape tools for 
you to choose from. Follow these steps to draw a 
shape in your document:
 
1. Choose your desired shape tool from the 
Tools panel.
 
 You can also press Shift+U to cycle through 
the shape tools. All the following tools 
have associated Geometry options, which 
are described in the section “Specifying 
Geometry options,” later in this chapter. Here 
are the tools that are available:
 
• Rectangle and Ellipse: As with their 
Marquee counterparts, you can hold 
down the Shift key while dragging to 
produce a square or circle; hold down 
the Alt key to draw the shape from the center outward.
 
• Rounded Rectangle: This tool works like the regular Rectangle but 
with the addition of a radius value used to round off the corners of 
the rectangle.
 
• Polygon: This tool creates a polygon with a specified number of 
sides, from 3 to 100.
 
• Line: This tool draws a line with a width from 1 to 1000 pixels. You 
can also add arrowheads at either end.
 
• Custom: Custom is the most varied shape tool. You have numer-
ous preset custom shapes to choose from. As with any shape, hold 
down Shift to constrain proportions or Alt (Option on the Mac) to 
draw from the center out.
 
2. Click the down-pointing arrow just to the right of the Shape tools to 
specify your Geometry options.
 
 For detailed explanations on the various Geometry options, see the 
upcoming sections.
 
 If you chose the Custom Shape tool in Step 1, click the down-pointing 
arrow to access the drop-down Shapes panel and choose your desired 
shape. You can access more preset shape libraries via the pop-up menu 
at the top of the panel.
Figure 12-15: Elements images 
can be vector-based (top) or 
pixel-based (bottom).

Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
3. Select your desired color from the Color drop-down panel on the 
Options bar.
 
 Click the More Colors button (down-pointing arrow) to access the Color 
Picker for additional color choices.
 
4. Select a style from the Style drop-down 
panel.
 
 To jazz up the shape with bevels and other 
fancy edges, choose a style from the panel. 
For more on styles, see Chapter 11.
 
5. Drag in the document to draw the shape 
you defined.
 
 The shape appears in the Image window on 
its own shape layer. Check out the Layers 
panel to see this phenomenon. Figure 12-16 
shows our shape, a Japanese hairstyle, 
which we add to in the following section.
Drawing multiple shapes
After you create a shape layer, you can draw additional shapes on that layer. 
You can add, subtract, overlap, and intersect shapes in exactly the same way 
you do with selections (see Chapter 7). Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select your desired state button on the Options bar.
 
 You can choose from the following options:
 
• New Shape Layer: Creates your initial shape layer
 
• Add to Shape Area: Combines and joins 
two or more shapes
 
• Subtract from Shape Area: Subtracts 
one shape from another shape
 
• Intersect Shape Areas: Creates a shape 
from only the areas that overlap
 
• Exclude Overlapping Shape Areas: 
Creates a shape from only the areas 
that don’t overlap
 
2. Choose your desired Shape tool and draw 
the next shape.
 
 We completed the shape by adding the face, 
as shown in Figure 12-17.

the gamut from the ordinary to 
the exotic, such as this hairstyle.

Specifying Geometry options
Geometry options help define how your shapes look. Click the down-pointing 
arrow on the Options bar to access the Geometry options described in the 
sections that follow.
Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle Geometry options
Here are the Geometry options for the Rectangle and Rounded Rectangle 
shapes:
 
✓ Unconstrained: Enables you to have free rein to draw a rectangle at any 
size or shape.
 
✓ Square: Constrains the shape to a perfect square.
 
✓ Fixed Size: Lets you draw rectangles in fixed sizes, as specified by your 
width and height values.
 
✓ Proportional: Allows you to define a proportion for the rectangle. For 
example, specifying 2W and 1H makes a rectangle twice as wide as it is 
high.
 
✓ From Center: Enables you to draw from the center out.
 
✓ Snap to Pixels: Aligns the shape to the pixels on your screen.
 
✓ Radius: For Rounded Rectangles, applies the radius of a circle used to 
round off the corners. Note that this option is found on the Options bar 
itself, not in the Geometry options drop-down menu.
Ellipse Geometry options
The Ellipse shape has the same options that are available for rectangles, 
except for the Snap to Pixels option. The only difference is that, instead of 
being able to create a perfect square, you can create a perfect circle with the 
Circle option.
Polygon Geometry options
The Geometry options for the Polygon shape are as follows:
 
✓ Radius: Enter the radius of a circle used to round off the corners of a 
polygon when you have the Smooth Corners option selected.
 
✓ Smooth Corners: Round off the corners.
 
✓ Star: Create an inward-pointing polygon called a star.
 
✓ Indent Sides By: Determine the amount the sides indent inward.
 
✓ Smooth Indents: Round off the inner corners of indented sides.
 
✓ Sides: Specify the number of sides for your polygon or the number of 
points for your star.

294
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Line Geometry options
The line’s Geometry settings include whether to put arrowheads at the start 
or end of the line. You can also adjust the width, length, and concavity set-
tings to change the arrowhead shapes.
Custom Shape Geometry options
The Custom Shape options are similar to those you find for the other shapes, 
but with a couple of unique options:
 
✓ Defined Proportions: Draws a shape based on the original proportions 
you used when you created it.
 
✓ Defined Size: Draws a shape based on its original size when you 
created it.
Editing shapes
You can edit shapes that you create by using a variety of tools and tech-
niques. Here’s a list of the things you can do to modify your shapes:
 
✓ Select: Choose the Shape Selection tool to move one or more shapes in 
their layers. This tool shares a flyout menu with the Shapes tools.
 
✓ Move: Choose the Move tool (press V ) to move the entire contents of 
the shape layer.
 
✓ Delete: Select a shape and press Delete to remove it.
 
✓ Transform shapes: Choose the Shape Selection tool and select your 
shape. Choose Image➪Transform Shape and choose your desired 
transformation.
 
✓ Change the color: Double-click the thumbnail of the shape layer on the 
Layers panel. This action transports you to the Color Picker, where you 
can choose a new color.
 
✓ Clone a shape: Hold down Alt (Option on the Mac) and move the shape 
with the Move tool.
 
To convert your vector-based shape into a pixel-based shape, click the 
Simplify button on the Options bar or choose Layer➪Simplify Layer. Note 
that you can’t edit a shape after you simplify it, except to modify the pixels. 
But you can now apply filters to the layer. See Chapter 11 for more on fun 
with filters.

A
lthough we spout on in this book about how a picture says a thousand 
words, we would be terribly negligent if we didn’t at least give a nod to 
the power of the written word, as well. You may find that you never 
need to go near the type tools. That’s fine. We won’t be offended 
if you skip right past this chapter.
Then again, you may have an occasional need to add a 
caption, a headline, or maybe even a short paragraph 
to an image. Although it’s by no means a word-
processing or even page-layout program, Elements 
does give you ample tools for creating, editing, styl-
izing, and even distorting type.
Understanding Type Basics
Elements has four type tools. Two of them are for enter-
ing horizontally oriented type, and two are for entering 
vertically oriented type. Don’t worry about the vertical type 
tools. Although you can use them, they’re really designed for the 
Asian market, to enter Chinese and Japanese characters. The horizontal 
and vertical type tools are identical in their attributes, so we just cover the 
two horizontal type tools from here on, and for the sake of simplicity, we just 
call them the Type and Type Mask tools:

296
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
✓ Type: Use this tool to enter type. This type is created on its own type 
layer, except when used in Bitmap mode or Indexed Color mode, neither 
of which supports layers.
 
 We refer to layers a lot in this chapter, so if your layer knowledge is 
rusty, check out Chapter 8.
 
✓ Type Mask: This tool doesn’t create actual type; instead, it creates a 
selection border in the shape of the type you want to enter. The selec-
tion border is added to the active layer. You can do anything with a type 
selection that you can do with any other selection.
 
 We also talk more about selections in this chapter; for even more detail 
on selections, see Chapter 7.
You can enter text in Elements in two different modes: point type and para-
graph type. Both the Type and Type Mask tools can enter either one. Here’s 
a brief description of each one (for the step-by-step process of creating the 
text, see the following sections):
 
✓ Point: Use this mode if you want to enter only a few words or so. To 
create point type, select the Type tool, click in your image, and, well, 
type. The text appears while you type and continues to grow. In fact, it 
even continues past the boundary of your image! Remember that point 
type never wraps around to a new line. To wrap to the next line, you 
must press Enter.
 
✓ Paragraph: Use this mode to enter longer chunks of text on an image. 
To create paragraph type, click and drag your type tool to create a text 
bounding box and then type. All the text is entered in this resizable 
bounding box. If a line of text is too long, Elements automatically wraps 
it around to the next line.
Elements is capable of displaying and printing type in two different formats. 
Each format has its pros and cons, and which format you use depends on 
your needs. Here’s the lowdown on each one:
 
✓ Vector: All text in Elements is initially created as vector type. Vector type 
provides scalable outlines that you can resize without producing jaggy 
edges in the diagonal strokes. Vector type remains fully editable and 
always prints with optimum quality, appearing crisp and clean. Vector 
type is the default type format in Elements.
 
✓ Raster: When Elements converts vector type into pixels, the text is 
rasterized. Elements refers to this rasterization process as simplifying. 
When text is simplified, it’s no longer editable but is converted into a 
raster image. You usually simplify your vector type when you want to 
apply filters to the type to produce a special effect or when you want to 
merge the type with the image. You can’t resize simplified type without 
losing some quality or risking jagged edges. For more details, see the 
section “Simplifying Type,” later in this chapter.

297
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
Creating Point Type
The majority of your type entry will most likely be in point type mode. Point 
type is useful for short chunks of text, such as headlines, labels, logos, and 
headings for Web pages.
Point type is so called because it’s preceded by a single anchor point, which 
marks the starting point of the line of the type. Remember that point-type 
lines don’t wrap automatically, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
 
Figure 13-1: Point type doesn’t wrap automatically, but instead can run off your image into 
 
a type Neverland.
Follow these steps to create point type:
 
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open an image or create a new, blank 
Elements file (File➪New).
 
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
 
 You can also press the T key.
 
3. On the image, click where you want to insert your text.
 
 Your cursor is called an I-beam. When you click, you make an insertion 
point.
 
 A small, horizontal line about one-third of the way up the I-beam shows 
the baseline (the line on which the text sits) for horizontal type.
 
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
 
 All the options are described in detail in the section “Specifying Type 
Options,” later in this chapter.
 
5. Type your text and press Enter to begin a new line.
 
 When you press Enter, you insert a hard return that doesn’t move.
 
6. When you finish entering the text, click the Commit button (the check 
mark icon) on the Options bar.

298
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
 You can also commit the type by pressing Enter on the numeric keypad 
or by clicking any other tool on the Tools panel. A new type layer with 
your text is created. Type layers appear on your Layers panel and are 
indicated by the T icon.
Creating Paragraph Type
If you have larger chunks of text, it’s more practical to enter the text as 
paragraph type. Entering paragraph type is similar to entering text in a word-
processing or page-layout program, except that it’s contained inside a bound-
ing box. When you type and come to the end of the bounding box, Elements 
automatically wraps the text to the next line.
To enter paragraph type, follow these steps:
 
1. Open an image or create a new, blank Elements file.
 
2. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel or press the T key.
 
3. On the image, insert and size the bounding box by using one of two 
methods:
 
• Drag to create a bounding box close to your desired size. After you 
release the mouse button, you can drag any of the handles at the 
corners and sides of the box to resize the box.
 
• Hold down the Alt (Option on the Mac) key and click the image. The 
Paragraph Text Size dialog box appears. Enter the exact dimen-
sions of your desired bounding box. When you click OK, your 
specified box appears, complete with handles for resizing later, if 
necessary.
 
4. Specify your type options from the Options bar.
 
 Options are described in detail in the following section.
 
5. Enter your text; to start a new paragraph, press Enter.
 
 Each line wraps around to fit inside the bounding box, as shown in 
Figure 13-2.
 
 If you type more text than can squeeze into the text box, an overflow 
icon appears. Just resize the text box by dragging a bounding box 
handle.
 
6. Click the Commit button (the check mark icon) on the Options bar or 
press Enter on the numeric keypad.
 
 Elements creates a new type layer.

 Chapter 13: Working with Type
 
 
Figure 13-2: Paragraph type automatically wraps to fit within your 
 
bounding box.
Specifying Type Options
You can find several character and 
paragraph type settings on the 
Options bar, as shown in Figure 13-3. 
These options enable you to specify 
your type to your liking and pair it 
with your images.
Here’s an explanation of each avail-
able option on the Options bar, from 
left to right:
 
✓ Font family: Select the font you 
want from the drop-down list. 
Elements provides a WYSIWYG 
(What You See Is What You Get) 
font menu. After each font name, 
the word Sample is rendered 
in the actual font — no more 
selecting a font without knowing 
what it really looks like. You also find one of these abbreviations before 
each font name to let you know what type of font it is:
 
• a: Adobe Type 1 (PostScript) fonts
 
• TT: TrueType fonts
 
• O: OpenType fonts
 
 Fonts with no abbreviation are bitmapped fonts.
Figure 13-3: Specify your type options, such as 
font family and size, before you type.

300
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
✓ Font style: Some font families have additional styles, such as light or 
condensed. Only the styles available for a particular font appear in the 
list. This is also a WYSIWYG menu.
 
✓ Font size: Select your type size from the drop-down list or just type a 
size in the text box. Note that type size is most commonly measured in 
points (72 points equals about 1 inch at a resolution of 72 ppi). You can 
switch to millimeters or pixels by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Units and 
Rulers (or Elements➪Preferences➪Units and Rulers).
 
✓ Anti-aliasing: Select Anti-aliasing to slightly smooth out the edges of 
your text. Anti-aliasing softens that edge by 1 pixel, as shown in Figure 
13-4. For the most part, you want to keep this option turned on. The one 
occasion in which you may want it turned off is when you’re creating 
small type to be displayed onscreen, such as on Web pages. The soft 
edges can sometimes be tough to read easily.
 
Anti-aliased
Not anti-aliased
 
Figure 13-4: Anti-aliasing softens the edges of your type.
 
✓ Faux Bold: Use this option to create a fake bold style when a real bold 
style (which you’d choose under Font Style) doesn’t exist. Be warned 
that although the sky won’t fall, applying faux styles can distort the pro-
portions of a font. You should use fonts with real styles, and if they don’t 
exist, oh, well.

301
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
 
✓ Faux Italic: This option creates a phony italic style and carries the same 
warning as the Faux Bold option.
 
✓ Underline: This setting obviously underlines your type, like this.
 
✓ Strikethrough: Choose this option to apply a strikethrough style to your 
text.
 
✓ Text alignment: These three options align your horizontal text on the 
left or right, or in the center. If you happen to have vertical text, these 
options rotate 90 degrees clockwise and change into top, bottom, and 
center vertical settings.
 
✓ Leading: Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the amount of space 
between the baselines of lines of type. A baseline is the imaginary line 
on which a line of type sits. You can choose Auto Leading or specify the 
amount of leading to apply. When you choose Auto Leading, Elements 
uses a value of 120 percent of your type point size. Therefore, 10-point 
type gets 12 points of leading. Elements adds that extra 20 percent so 
that the bottoms of the lowest letters don’t crash into the tops of the 
tallest letters on the line below them.
 
✓ Text Color: Click the color swatch to select a color for your type from 
the Color Picker. You can also choose a color from the Swatches panel.
 
✓ Style: Click this option to access a drop-down panel of preset styles 
that you can apply to your type. For more on this option and the Create 
Warped Text option (described in the following bullet), see “Stylizing 
and Warping Type,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Create Warped Text: This fun option lets you distort type in more than 
a dozen ways.
 
✓ Change the Text Orientation: Select your type layer and then click this 
option to switch between vertical and horizontal type orientations.
 
✓ Cancel: Click this button (or press Esc) to cancel and keep the type from 
being entered. Use this option or the Commit option only after you click 
the type tool on your canvas.
 
✓ Commit: Click this button to apply the type to your canvas.
Editing Text
If you read the first part of this chapter and slogged with us through all the 
available options for type in Elements, just remember that you can apply 
these settings either before or after you enter your text. To correct typos, 
add and delete type, or change any of the type options, simply follow these 
steps:

302
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
 
1. Select the Type tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Select your desired type layer on the Layers panel or click within the 
text to automatically select the type layer.
 
3. Do one of the following:
 
• To change the font family, size, color, or other type option: If you 
want to change all the text, simply select that type layer on the 
Layers panel. To select only portions of the text, highlight the text 
by dragging across it with the I-beam of the Type tool.
 
• To delete text: Highlight the text by dragging across it with the 
I-beam of the Type tool. Then press the Backspace key (Delete on 
the Mac).
 
• To add text: Make an insertion point by clicking your I-beam within 
the line of text. Then, type your new text.
 
4. When you’re done editing your text, click the Commit button.
 
You may also occasionally need to transform your text. To do so, make 
sure that the type layer is selected on the Layers panel. Then, choose 
Image➪Transform➪Free Transform. Grab a handle on the bounding box and 
drag to rotate or scale. Press Ctrl (Ô on the Mac) and drag a handle to dis-
tort. When you’re done, double-click inside the bounding box to commit the 
transformation. For more details on transformations, see Chapter 9.
Simplifying Type
As we explain in the section “Understanding Type Basics,” earlier in this 
chapter, Elements can display and print type in two different formats: vector 
and raster. Remember that as long as you keep type in a vector format in a 
type layer, you can edit and resize that type all day long.
Occasionally, however, you may find the need to simplify your type — to con-
vert your type into pixels. After it’s simplified, you can apply filters, paint on 
the type, and apply gradients and patterns. If you’re working with layers and 
flatten your image (merge your layers into a single background image), your 
type layer is also simplified and merged with the other pixels in your image. 
By the way, if you try to apply a filter to a type layer, Elements barks at you 
that the type layer must be simplified before proceeding and gives you the 
opportunity to click OK (if you want to simplify) or Cancel.
To simplify your type, select the type layer on the Layers panel and choose 
Layer➪Simplify Layer. Your type layer is then converted (the T icon disap-
pears) into a regular layer on which your type is now displayed as pixels 
against a transparent background, as shown in Figure 13-5.

303
 Chapter 13: Working with Type
 
To avoid re-creating your type 
from scratch, be sure to make all 
necessary edits before simplifying. 
This includes sizing your text. After 
you simplify your type, you can’t 
resize your text without risking the 
dreaded jaggies. The other downside 
to remember about simplified type 
is that although it looks identical to 
vector type onscreen, it never prints 
as crisply and cleanly as vector type. 
Even at higher-resolution settings, a 
slight jagged edge always appears on 
simplified type. So, if you’re experi-
menting with painting or filters on 
your type, just make a duplicate of 
your type layer before simplifying it 
and then hide that layer.
Masking with Type
Using the Type Mask tool epitomizes 
the combination of type and image. 
Unlike its conventional cousin, the 
Type Mask tool doesn’t create a new 
layer. Instead, it creates a selection on the active layer. This is the tool of 
choice for filling text with an image or cutting text out of an image so that the 
background shows through, as shown in Figure 13-6.
 
A selection is a selection, no matter how it was created. So, even though they 
look like letters, they act like selections. You can move, modify, and save 
them.
Here are the steps to create a type mask:
 
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, open the image of your choice.
 
 We selected a stone texture.
 
2. Convert your background into a layer by double-clicking the word 
Background on the Layers panel and then click OK.
 
 This step enables you to jazz up the type with styles later on.
 
3. Choose the Horizontal Type Mask tool from the Tools panel.
 
4. Specify your type options, such as font family, style, and size, on the 
Options bar.

5. Click the image and type your desired text. When you’re done, click 
the Commit button on the Options bar.
 
 A selection border in the shape of your type appears on your image.
 
6. Choose Select➪Inverse, which deselects your letter selections and 
selects everything else.
 
7. Press the Backspace key to delete everything outside your selection 
border.
 
 Your type is now filled with your image.
 
8. Choose Select➪Deselect.
 
9. Experiment with applying layer styles to your type.
 
 If the Effects panel isn’t visible, choose Window➪Effects. Select the 
Layer Styles button (second from the left) located in the Effects panel. 
Select the type of Layer Styles you desire from the drop-down list on the 
panel, such as Drop Shadows or Bevels. Finally, double-click the exact 
style you want. We used a drop shadow and an inner bevel in Figure 
13-7. See Chapter 11 for more layer styles.
 
 If you want to admire your type against a solid background, as we did, 
create a new layer and then choose Edit➪Fill Layer and choose your 
desired color from the Use drop-down menu.

Stylizing and Warping Type
If you tried your hand at creating a type mask in the preceding section, you 
know that Elements is capable of much more than just throwing a few black 
letters at the bottom of your image. With a few clicks here and there, you can 
warp, distort, enhance, and stylize your type. If you’re not careful, your cre-
ative typography can outshine your image.

306
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
Adjusting type opacity
If you checked out Chapter 8 before reading this chapter, you know that 
layers are a digital version of the old analog transparency sheets. You can 
change the opacity of ele-
ments on layers to enable 
the underlying layer to show 
through in varying degrees. 
This is also possible on a 
type layer. Peek at Figure 
13-8 to see how varying the 
percentage of opacity of our 
type layer makes more of 
the underlying layer of water 
show through.
To change the opacity of a 
type layer, simply select the 
layer in the Layers panel, click 
the arrow to the right of the 
Opacity percentage, and drag 
the slider. The lower the per-
centage, the less opaque the 
type (and the more the under-
lying layer shows through).
Applying filters to your type
One of the most interesting things you can do with type in Elements that you 
can’t do in a word-processing or page-layout program is apply special effects, 
such as filters. You can make type look like it’s on fire, underwater, or on 
the move, as shown in Figure 13-9, where we applied a motion blur. The only 
caveat is that type has to be simplified first before a filter can be applied. Be 
sure to do all your text editing before you get to the filtering stage. Applying 
the filter is as easy as just selecting the simplified type layer on the Layers 
panel and choosing a filter from the Filter menu. For more on filters, see 
Chapter 11.
Painting your type with color and gradients
Changing the color of text is as easy as highlighting it and selecting a color 
from the Color Picker. But what if you want to do something a little more 
unconventional, such as apply brush strokes of paint randomly across the 
type, like we did in the first image shown in Figure 13-10? It’s really easier 
than it looks. Again, as with applying filters to text, the only criterion is that 
the type has to be simplified first. After that’s done, select a color, grab the 
Brush tool with settings of your choice, and paint. In our example, we used 
the Granite Flow brush, found in the Special Effect Brushes presets. We used 
a diameter of 39, 15, and 6 pixels and just swiped our type a few times.

Figure 13-9: Applying a motion blur to type can make it appear as fast as the car.
 
If you want the color or gradient to be con-
fined to only the type area, you can select the 
text by either Ctrl-clicking (Ô-clicking on the 
Mac) the layer containing the text or locking 
the transparency of the layer on the Layers 
panel.
You can also apply a gradient to your type. 
Here are the steps to follow after simplifying 
your type:
 
1. Select the Gradient tool from the Tools 
panel.
 
2. On the Options bar, click the down-
pointing arrow next to the Gradient 
Picker to access the Gradient Picker 
drop-down panel.
 
3. Choose your desired gradient.
 
 If you want to create a custom gradient, find out how in Chapter 12.
 
4. Position your gradient cursor on the text where you want your gradi-
ent to start and drag to where you want your gradient to end.
 
 Don’t like the results? Drag again until you get the look you want. 
Remember that you can drag at any angle and to any length, even out-
side your type. In the bottom image shown in Figure 13-10, we used 
Figure 13-10: Bring your type to 
life with color (top) or a gradient 
(bottom).

308
Part IV: Exploring Your Inner Artist 
the copper gradient and just dragged from the top of the letters to the 
bottom. We also locked the transparent pixels on the layer to confine 
the gradient to just the type area.
Warping your type
If horizontal or vertical text is just way too regimented for you, try some of 
the distortions you can apply to your type with the Warp feature. The best 
part about the distortions you apply to the type is that the text remains fully 
editable. This feature is fun and easy to use. Click the Create Warped Text 
button at the far-right end of the Options bar. (It’s the T with a curved line 
below it.) This action opens the Warp Text dialog box, where you find a vast 
array of distortions on the Style pop-up menu with descriptive names such as 
Bulge, Inflate, and Squeeze.
After selecting a warp style, you can adjust the orientation, amount of bend, 
and degree of distortion by dragging the sliders. The Bend setting affects the 
amount of warp, and the Horizontal and Vertical Distortions apply perspec-
tive to that warp. Luckily, you can also view the results while you adjust. We 
could give you technical explanations of these adjustments, but the best way 
to see what they do is to just play with them. See Figure 13-11 to get a quick 
look at a few of the warp styles. The names speak for themselves.
 
Note that you can also use the Transform command, such as scale and skew, 
to manipulate text. See Chapter 8 for details on transforming.

related to submitting photos to commercial photo 
labs and service centers.
In addition to printing, you have a number of dif-
ferent options for sharing images, and they’re all 
covered in the ﬁ nal chapters, where you can ﬁ nd 
out about slide shows and videodiscs, and about 
Web hosting, e-mailing, and sharing via online 
services. The opportunities are enormous, and 
you may want to look over all that Photoshop 
Elements has to offer related to photo output and 
ﬁ le sharing.

P
erhaps the greatest challenge to individuals using programs such as 
Photoshop Elements, and even the professionals who use its grand-
daddy, Adobe Photoshop, is getting what you see on your monitor to render 
a reasonable facsimile on a printed page. You can find all sorts of books 
on color printing — how to get color right, how to calibrate your 
equipment, and how to create and use color profiles — all 
for the purpose of getting a good match between your 
computer monitor and your printer. It’s downright dis-
couraging to spend a lot of time tweaking an image 
so that all the brilliant blue colors jump out on your 
computer monitor only to find that all those blues 
turn to murky purples when the photo is printed.
If you already read Chapters 2 and 3, you’re ahead 
of the game because you know a little bit about 
color management, color profiles, and printer reso-
lutions. After you check out those chapters, your 
next step is to get to know your printer or your print 
service center, and understand how to correctly print 
your pictures.
In this chapter, we talk about options — many options — for 
setting print attributes for printing to your own color printer, and we toss in 
some tips on how to get better results when you’re using print service cen-
ters. If you need to, reread this chapter a few times just to be certain that you 
understand the process for printing good-quality images. A little time spent 
here will, we hope, save you some headaches down the road.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Getting Pictures Ready for Printing
The first step toward getting your photos to your desktop printer or to a 
printing service is to prepare each image for optimum output. You have 
several considerations when you’re preparing files, including the ones in 
this list:
 
✓ Set resolution and size. Before you print a file, use the Image Size dialog 
box (Image➪Resize➪Image Size) to set your image size and the optimum 
resolution for your printer. Files that have too much resolution can print 
images that are inferior to files optimized for a printer. See your print-
er’s documentation for recommendations for resolution. As a general 
rule, 300 ppi (pixels per inch) works best for most printers printing on 
high-quality paper. If you print on plain paper, you often find that lower 
resolutions work just as well or even better.
 
✓ Make all brightness and color corrections before printing. It stands to 
reason that you want to make sure that your pictures appear their best 
before sending them off to your printer. If you have your monitor prop-
erly calibrated, as we discuss in Chapter 2, you should see a fair repre-
sentation of what your pictures will look like before you print them.
 
✓ Decide how color will be managed before you print. You can color-
manage output to your printer in three ways, as we discuss in the next 
section. Know your printer’s profiles and how to use them before you 
start to print your files.
Working with Color Printer Profiles
In Chapter 2, we talk about creating color profiles for your monitor and 
selecting a color workspace. The final leg in a color-managed workflow is to 
convert color from your color workspace profile to your printer’s color pro-
file. Basically, this conversion means that the colors you see on your monitor 
in your current workspace are accurately converted to the color that can 
be reproduced by your printer. To print accurate color, you need to have a 
color profile used by your printer at print time.
Understanding how Elements uses color profiles
You can manage color in Photoshop Elements in three ways when it comes 
time to print your files:
 
✓ Printer Manages Colors: This method permits your printer to decide 
which profile is used when your photo is printed to your desktop color 
printer. Your printer makes this decision according to the paper you 
select as the source paper used to print your photos. If you choose 

313
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, for example, your printer chooses 
the profile that goes along with that particular paper. If you choose 
another paper, your printer chooses a different color profile. This 
method is all automatic, and color profile selection is made when you 
print your file.
 
✓ Photoshop Elements Manages Color: When you make this choice, color 
management is taken out of the hands of your printer and is controlled 
by Elements. You must choose a color profile after making this choice 
in the Print dialog box. Many color profiles are installed with desktop 
printers falling in the medium to more expensive models.
 
✓ No Color Management: You use this choice if you have a color pro-
file embedded in one of your pictures. You’ll probably rarely use this 
option. Unless you know how to embed profiles or receive files with 
embedded profiles from other users, don’t make this choice in the Print 
dialog box.
Each of these three options requires you to make some kind of choice about 
how color is managed. You make choices (as we discuss later in this chapter, 
when we walk you through the steps for printing) about whether to color-
manage your output. These selections are all unique to the Print dialog box 
for your individual printer.
Converting color to a printer profile
The third option in the preceding section mentions printing a file with con-
verted color. If you choose one of the first two options for converting color 
(either you select a profile or you let the printer select one), the image on 
your monitor doesn’t change. The conversion happens at print time.
You can physically convert the color in your image to a given printer profile, 
and doing so actually shows you how the color is converted before you print 
your file. In a way, you’re proofing color before wasting paper and ink. If you 
want to print files with accurate color, we recommend using this method.
In Windows, you can download a free utility from Dry Creek Photo (www.
drycreekphoto.com) that converts color from a workspace to a color pro-
file. Suppose that you want to print some pictures at a discount store, such 
as Costco, and you want to be certain to use the correct profile for the photo 
equipment that prints your pictures. You want to convert color from your 
color workspace (in this case, sRGB will work best for you) to the profile 
used for a photo printer and paper you want to order.
Follow these steps to prepare a file for a photo service, such as Costco, 
or when printing to your own desktop printer that installs profiles for the 
papers you use:

314
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
1. Make all the necessary edits you need to make in Elements and save 
your files in TIFF format.
 
 You must use TIFF format to use the converter we mention in Step 6.
 
2. Download color profiles from your provider’s Web site.
 
 Almost all service centers post color profiles for their printing equip-
ment. You can visit the Costco Web site at www.costco.com and click 
the Photo link on the home page to go to the Photo Center. You’re 
prompted to set up an account, and then you see a page where profiles 
are listed. Costco makes the profiles available for stores in their geo-
graphic regions, and usually you find profiles for printing on the store’s 
equipment and profiles best suited for different papers. Note: If several 
profiles are available for downloading, be certain to use the right profile 
for the paper you want your pictures to be printed on.
 
 If you use a photo lab that wants you to convert color and embed pro-
files, you can visit independent lab Web sites and download profiles, as 
well.
 
 If you want to convert color to your own printer, use a color profile 
installed for your printer.
 
3. Copy the profiles to your system color folder: C:\WINDOWS\
system32\spool\drivers\color.
 
 This folder is where all your color profiles are stored. Note that the path 
is the same for Windows XP and Windows Vista.
 
 If you’re converting color for your own printer, this folder contains 
all the color profiles installed by your printer when you installed the 
printer driver.
 
4. Download a converter by going to www.drycreekphoto.com/tools/
profile_converter and clicking the ProfileConverterSetup.zip link.
 
 You need a utility to convert files that use the Adobe RGB (1998) or 
sRGB color space to the color space used by machines at your service 
center. Fortunately, the Dry Creek Photo converter is a great free tool.
  
 The Dry Creek Photo Web site is one of the best sources of information 
available for color management and color profiling. In addition to offer-
ing custom color-profiling services, Dry Creek Photo hosts a number of 
different color profiles for many different commercial printers.
 
5. After downloading the file to your hard drive, double-click the Setup 
file and follow the brief steps in the install wizard.
 
6. Choose Start➪Programs➪Dry Creek Photo➪Profile Converter➪ICC 
Profile Converter.
 
 The simple program interface opens, as shown in Figure 14-1.

315
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
 
Figure 14-1: Select the options for converting the color profile and 
 
select the Embed Profile in Image check box before clicking the 
 
Convert button.
 
7. Click the Source Image ellipsis ( . . . ) and select the source file.
 
 The source file is the file saved in TIFF format that you want to print.
 
8. Click the Source Color Profile ellipsis and select the source color 
profile.
 
 This color profile is currently embedded in your source file.
 
9. Click the Destination Image ellipsis and select the folder where you 
want to save your file.
 
10. Click the Destination Color Profile ellipsis and select the color profile 
used by the equipment where you place your order.
 
 You saved your color profiles to the Windows color folder, so be certain 
to look in this folder for the target printer color profiles.
 
11. If you want to process multiple files, select the Process Multiple Files 
check box.
 
12. Be certain to select the Embed Profile in Image check box and then 
click the Convert button.
 
 After you click Convert, the profile converter handles the profile conver-
sion and saves your files to the target folder.
Printing to Epson Inkjet Printers
Print settings vary according to manufacturers, and we can’t hope to cover 
all printers in this chapter. We choose to discuss Epson printers as an intro-
duction to printing to desktop color printers in this chapter, but we also 
show some print options for HP and Canon low-end inkjets later in the 
chapter.

316
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
If you own a different brand of printer or use a service that uses other 
printers, what’s important to know in reviewing this section is the process 
involved in printing your files. Regardless of what type of printer you own, be 
aware of when a color profile is used and how color is either managed or not 
managed. You may have different check-box selections and menu commands, 
but the process is the same for any printer printing your photos.
Over the past few years, at least half of many service-provider troubleshoot-
ing tech calls coming from clients involved problems with accurate color 
output from Epson and some other ink jet printers. We’re not talking about 
subtle changes between monitor and printer, but huge, monstrous color 
changes on output prints. As it turns out, almost all the strange output 
results originated from just one minor error when setting up a file to print — 
specifically, managing color in the Print dialog box.
 
Color profiles are also dependent upon the ink being used and refilling car-
tridges with generic ink can (in some cases) result in colors being shifted. 
Similarly, if the nozzles aren’t clean and delivering ink consistently, you can 
get some very strange results.
We’ve come up with settings that will work well for you to get accurate 
results without stress or frustration. Just remember to use the settings 
exactly as described, and you can achieve superior results with either 
desktop or professional printers.
When you install your printer driver, the installation utility also installs 
a number of color profiles. You can choose the profiles in the Photoshop 
Elements Print dialog box and control all the printing by using the profile 
provided by your printer manufacturer.
 
You can also print from the Organizer by selecting one or more image thumb-
nails in the Organizer window and then choosing File➪Print. We use printing 
from Full Edit mode for the examples shown here because you may often 
want to perform some final corrections before printing.
You have a choice for how these profiles are used. You can
 
✓ Choose to let your printer manage color. The profiling selection is auto-
matic, and you don’t have to worry about making other choices in the 
Print dialog boxes.
 
✓ Choose to let Photoshop Elements manage color, in which case, you 
need to make some choices about the color profile to be used and make 
choices for the color management process.

317
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
We’re talking about two very different issues here. One issue is color manage-
ment, which ultimately comes down to who manages color — your printer or 
no color management. The other issue is choosing a color profile. Therefore, 
you have a series of combined options to choose from. You can choose a pro-
file and either turn color management on or off, or you can elect to not make 
a profile choice and decide whether color management is on or off. What 
choices you make are critical to getting color right on your output.
All the methods are described in the following sections.
Automatic profile selection for Epson printers
The automatic profile selection method exists, and depending on what model 
of printer you have, you may be required to make this choice.
Your options all depend on whether the printer you buy installs color pro-
files on your computer. If you buy some low-end color printers that cost less 
than $100, the installer software typically doesn’t install color profiles. When 
no profiles are installed, the printer manages the color through built-in pro-
files contained in the printer’s memory.
High-end models (above the $100 price range) often install individual color 
profiles. You might see the profiles for various papers in the Printer Profile 
pop-up menu in the Elements Print dialog box. If you have one of these high-
end printers, you might want to choose the profile that matches the paper 
you’re using and let Elements manage the color.
Sizing files for output
When we talk about sizing files, we’re referring 
to the physical width, the height dimensions, and 
the resolution. If you print your pictures at 8 x 10 
inches, be certain that you visit the Image Size 
dialog box by choosing Image➪Resize➪Image 
Size and verify that the width and height dimen-
sions are established for your desired paper 
size. Also critically important is the image reso-
lution, which you can also adjust in the Image 
Size dialog box. Use your printer manufacturer 
recommendations for resolution, according 
to the paper type you use. If you can’t find a 
recommendation in the user manual, use 300 
ppi (pixels per inch) as a standard for printing 
to quality coated-paper stocks, such as Epson 
Premium Glossy Photo Paper.
Above all, don’t size your image resolution larger 
than the default size of your photo. For example, 
if you have a 5-x-7-inch photo at 300 ppi, don’t 
try to size the photo up to 8 x 10 inches at 300 
ppi. Doing so can produce unexpected results. 
If you need an image size larger than your file 
size, go back to your original digital camera 
image, edit it for color correction, and size it to 
the desired output. If the original camera image 
is smaller than you want, you’re stuck and can’t 
get a quality print that greatly exceeds your 
camera’s capture capabilities.

318
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
As we discuss in Chapter 2, you have two choices for your color workspace. 
Those choices are sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998). The workspace is used to see 
color on your monitor. We also talk about calibrating your monitor so the 
colors you see appear as close to real-world color as you can get.
When you print a picture, the color from your workspace (either sRGB or 
Adobe RGB [1998]) is converted to your printer color. So, you want to take all 
the color you see in an sRGB workspace, for example, and fit that color into 
the printer’s profile so the print looks as close as possible to what you see on 
your monitor. Elements takes care of this color conversion. The only thing 
you need to worry about is making the right choice for how that conversion 
will take place.
Follow these steps to print from the native color space:
 
1. Choose File➪Print.
 
 The Print dialog box that 
opens contains all the set-
tings you need to print a file.
 
2. Select the orientation of 
your print.
 
 Your choices are either 
Portrait or Landscape, as 
shown in Figure 14-2. Click 
the proper orientation from 
the icons in the lower-left 
corner of the Print dialog 
box.
 
3. Choose your printer.
 
 Select the printer you use 
from the Printer drop-down 
menu.
 
4. Set the print attributes.
 
 Select the number of copies, 
position, scaling, and output 
items you want.
 
 In the Color Management 
area of the Print dialog box, 
as shown in Figure 14-3, you can make choices for how to manage color 
when you print files.
 
5. From the Printer Profile drop-down list, select Printer Manages Color.
 
 This choice uses your current workspace color and later converts the 
color from your workspace to the printer output file when you open 
Portrait
Landscape
Figure 14-2: Click the orientation matching your 
photo.

319
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
the printer driver dialog box. 
As you can see in Figure 14-3, 
the Source Space is sRGB. The 
Color Management section of 
the Print dialog box indicates 
that the color will be converted 
from sRGB — the working 
space — to the color space 
managed by the printer.
 
6. Click Print in the Print dialog 
box.
 
 The file doesn’t print yet. 
Rather, the Windows system 
Print dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 14-4.
 
7. Verify that your target printer 
is still selected in the Windows 
Print dialog box and click 
Preferences.
 
 The printer driver dialog box 
opens.
 
 Each printer displays a differ-
ent dialog box after you click 
Properties in the Windows 
Print dialog box. Figure 14-5 
shows the Epson Stylus Photo 
R230Series Properties dialog 
box. Although many Epson 
printers use an identical dialog 
box, you find that some Epson 
printers, especially the high-end 
devices, display different dialog 
boxes. Furthermore, print-
ers from other manufacturers 
appear with completely differ-
ent settings in the printer driver 
dialog box.
 
8. Set print attributes.
 
 In our Epson example, select 
Epson Premium Glossy (or 
another paper from the Type 
drop-down list that you may be 
using) and then click the Best Photo radio button, as shown in 
Figure 14-5.
Figure 14-3: Look over the Color Management 
area in the Print dialog box for options on how 
to manage color.
Figure 14-4: Click Print in the Elements Print 
dialog box to open the Windows Print dialog box.

 Now, it’s time to color manage 
your file. This step is critical in 
your print production workflow.
 
9. Click the Advanced button and 
then, in the Warning dialog 
box that appears, simply click 
Continue.
 
 The Advanced Settings 
dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 14-6.
 
10. Make your choices in the 
Advanced Settings dialog box.
 
 Here are the most important 
choices:
 
• Select a paper type. You 
selected paper already? 
The second drop-down 
menu in the Paper & 
Quality section of the 
dialog box determines 
the application of inks. 
Choose the same paper 
here as you did in Step 8.
 
• Turn on color manage-
ment. Because you’re 
letting the print driver 
determine the color, you 
need to be certain that 
the Color Controls radio 
button is active. This set-
ting tells the print driver 
to automatically select 
a printer profile for the 
paper type you selected.
 
• Set the color mode. Don’t 
use Epson Vivid. This 
choice produces inferior 
results on photos. Choose 
Best Photo, the Epson 
Standard, or Adobe RGB, depending on your printer (see Figure 
14-6).
 
 If you frequently print files using the same settings, you can save 
your settings by clicking the Save Setting button.
Figure 14-5: Select the paper type from the 
Type drop-down list and the Best Photo 
option for printing photos.
Figure 14-6: Click Advanced and then click 
Continue to access the advanced settings in 
the Epson printer driver.

321
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
11. To print the photo, click OK and then OK again in the Print dialog box.
 
 Your file is sent to your printer. The color is converted automatically 
from your source workspace of sRGB or Adobe RGB (1998) to the profile 
the printer driver automatically selects for you.
Selecting a printer profile
Another method for managing color when you’re printing files is to select 
a printer profile from the available list of color profiles installed with your 
printer. Whereas in the preceding section, you used your printer to manage 
color, this time, you let Photoshop Elements manage the color.
The steps in this section are the same as the ones described in the preceding 
section for printing files for automatic profile selection when you’re setting 
up the page and selecting a printer. When you choose File➪Print, you open 
the Elements Print dialog box. To let Elements handle the color conversion, 
follow these steps in the Print dialog box:
 
1. From the Printer Profile drop-down list in the Print dialog box, select 
the color profile designed for use with the paper you’ve chosen to 
print your image.
 
 In this example, we use a heavyweight matte paper color profile, as 
shown in Figure 14-7. (Note that custom color profiles you acquire from 
a profiling service come with recommended color-rendering intents. For 
this paper, Relative Colormetric is recommended and is selected in the 
Rendering Intent drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 14-7.)
 
2. Click Print.
 
 The second Print dialog box 
opens.
 
3. Click the Properties button.
 
 You arrive at the same dialog 
box shown in Figure 14-5.
 
4. Click the Best Photo radio 
button. From the Type drop-
down list, select the recom-
mended paper choice.
 
 Custom color profiles are also 
shipped with guidelines for 
selecting proper paper.
 
5. Click Advanced and click Continue to arrive at the same dialog box 
shown earlier in Figure 14-6.
Figure 14-7: Choose a printer profile that 
matches the paper you use.

322
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 The paper choice selection is 
automatically carried over from 
the previous Properties dialog 
box (in Step 2 in the steps in 
the preceding section). The one 
different setting you make is in 
the Color Management section.
 
6. Click the ICM (Image Color 
Management) radio button 
and check Off (No Color 
Adjustment), as shown in 
Figure 14-8.
 
 Because you selected the color 
profile in Step 1 and you’re let-
ting Elements manage the color, 
be sure that color management 
is turned off. If you don’t turn 
off color management, you end 
up double-profiling your print.
 
When to choose to manage color and when to choose to not manage color 
is simplified in Photoshop Elements. In the Color Management area of the 
dialog box, a message is reported each time you make a selection from the 
Color Handling drop-down menu. Right below Source Space, you see a mes-
sage asking if you remembered to turn color management on or off. Each time 
you make a selection for the Color Handling, pause a moment and read the 
message. This is your reminder that you need to follow the recommendation 
to properly handle color.
Printing with a custom profile
Printing with a custom profile is very simple. Just remember that you must 
use the profile with exactly the same settings that you used to print the test 
target when the profile was created. For custom profiles, you always use No 
Color Management throughout the output process.
Let us make this concept even clearer. When you generate your test target 
for the profiling service where you may order a custom profile created for 
your printer, the service requires that you print the target without color 
conversions of any kind. The target has to reflect the actual colors generated 
by your printer from a known sample file, with no modifications whatsoever, 
for a known printing condition and media type. The resulting profile tells the 
color engine exactly how to modify the output data to match the colors as 
closely as possible to your working space or a different previously embedded 
color profile.
Figure 14-8: Click ICM and click Off (No Color 
Adjustment).

323
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
For all this to work properly, the printer can’t be allowed to modify the print-
ing data in any way. All the work has to be done by Photoshop Elements. So, 
assuming that you have a custom profile ready to use, here’s the setup:
 
1. Use a profile converter to convert color.
 
 In Windows, use a utility, such as the Dry Creek Photo Profile Converter. 
(For details, see “Converting color to a printer profile,” earlier in this 
chapter.)
 
 If you’ve obtained a custom pro-
file from a media supplier, you 
must use the specific media and 
intent settings it recommends 
for your printer, although all 
other instructions in this sec-
tion are the same.
 
2. Open the converted file 
in Elements and choose 
File➪Print.
 
3. In the Print dialog box, select 
No Color Management for your 
printer profile, as shown in Figure 14-9.
 
4. Turn off color management.
 
 Use the same settings for printing when you let Elements determine 
color. Be certain to turn off color management, the same way we show 
you in the preceding section (refer to Figure 14-7).
Printing to HP Inkjet Printers
Regardless of the printer you use, the process for printing follows the same 
logic that we describe for printing to Epson printers in the preceding sec-
tions. Unfortunately, each manufacturer uses different dialog boxes and dif-
ferent menu command names that can leave you completely confused if you 
try to apply the steps you use in printing on one printer to a different printer.
The three methods for managing color (as we describe in the section 
“Understanding how Elements uses color profiles,” earlier in this chapter) 
apply to all printers, but the dialog boxes, buttons, and menu choices appear 
differently.
If you own an HP printer, you probably know where to make your paper 
selection and your best photo selection. The most obscure setting is likely 
the color management choice. We don’t go through each detailed step for 
printing to an HP low-end desktop printer — take a look in the following sec-
tion to find out how to manage color.
Figure 14-9: Select No Color Management when 
you print files with converted color.

324
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
As with all printers, you have three choices for managing color with an HP 
printer:
 
✓ Let your printer determine color. Follow these general steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Print to open the Print dialog box.
 
2. From the Printer Profile 
drop-down menu, 
select Printer Color 
Management and then 
click Print.
 
 A second Print dialog box 
opens.
 
3. Click Properties to open 
the Printer Driver dialog 
box.
 
4. On the Advanced tab, 
click Graphic and 
click Image Color 
Management. From 
the ICM Method drop-
down menu, select ICM 
Handled by Printer, as 
shown in Figure 14-10.
 
✓ Let Elements determine color. Follow the preceding steps, but this 
time, select a color profile in the Print dialog box (refer to Step 2) and 
select ICM Disabled on the Advanced tab (refer to Step 4).
 
✓ Print a file with converted color. Follow the preceding steps, but select 
Same as Source in the Print dialog box (refer to Step 2) and select ICM 
Disabled on the Advanced tab (refer to Step 4).
Printing to Canon Printers
As with Epson and HP printers (which we describe in the preceding sec-
tions), you follow the same logic and choose to either enable or disable color 
management when printing to Canon printers. With Canon color printers, the 
area in the printer driver dialog box is even more hidden than in Epson and 
HP desktop printers.
When printing to Canon printers, you control color management in one of 
these ways:

Submitting Files to Service Centers
On provider Web sites, you can usually find guidelines for acceptable file 
formats and the recommended resolutions and dimensions of your images. If 
you don’t see these guidelines on Web sites, be sure to call and inquire about 
which file attributes are acceptable.
As a general rule, here are some things to consider when you’re submitting 
files, if guidelines aren’t provided:
 
✓ Color workspace: Always ask a provider what workspace it prefers to 
use to convert color. Online services generally recommend that you use 
sRGB as your color workspace.
 
✓ Resolution: For photo printing machines, be certain to submit files at 
300 ppi (pixels per inch). See Chapter 3 for more information on image 
resolution.
 
✓ Dimensions: As a general rule, size images to the print size. For exam-
ple, if you want 4-x-6-inch prints, be certain that your images are sized to 
4 x 6 inches at 300 ppi.
 
✓ File format: Some centers may take only JPEG images. If TIFF isn’t 
acceptable, locate the converted images you saved from the Dry Creek 
ICC Profile Converter and follow these steps (in Windows):
 
1. Open the TIFF file or files in Photoshop Elements and choose 
File➪Save As.
 
2. Be certain that the ICC Profile check box is selected in the Save 
Options in the Save/Save As dialog box. Select JPEG for the 
format and click Save.
 
 Notice that the profile used with the Dry Creek ICC Profile 
Converter is listed as the ICC Profile. In Figure 14-13, you can see 
a profile embedded for a Costco print center. (See the section 
“Converting color to a printer profile,” earlier in this chapter, for 
more on the Dry Creek Converter.)
 Figure 14-13: You can change file formats from TIFF to JPEG and 
preserve embedded profiles when you’re saving from Elements.

327
 Chapter 14: Getting It on Paper
 
✓ Media storage: If you walk into a FedEx Kinko’s store and go to the self-
serve photo-printing machines, you don’t see support for any external 
USB hard drives or removable USB drives. All the print centers support 
a wide range of media cards used by digital cameras. Be certain to use 
your memory card and not a USB device when placing orders. If you use 
CompactFlash II, memory sticks, or other media sources used by digital 
cameras, copy your files to these sources when you place orders as a 
walk-in customer.
 
Vendors that host Web sites with downloadable profiles and order informa-
tion are likely to accept file uploads online. This capability saves you the 
time spent fighting crowds when you’re placing orders. In some cases, you 
can have service centers mail your images back to you so that you don’t need 
to wait when you’re picking up orders, either. This online ordering stuff is a 
matter that we talk about in the following section.
Using Online Printing Services
Photoshop Elements supports the Adobe Photoshop Services program, 
which is a joint effort between Adobe Systems and Kodak EasyShare (for-
merly Ofoto), a division of Kodak. The Services program offers online order-
ing of prints and sharing of photos and projects, and it has a huge array of 
different print products for consumers and professionals.
As of this writing, you get ten free prints, so it’s worth taking a little time to 
check out the service — especially if you want to order prints and have them 
mailed directly to your home or office. No lines, no hassles, no fighting high-
rising gasoline costs — this service offers great prints and an abundance of 
convenience.
To use the service, follow these steps:
 
1. Select files in the Organizer much like you’d select files for printing.
 
2. In either editing mode or the Organizer, choose File➪Order Prints. 
Alternately, you can click the Share tab in the Panels Bin and click the 
Order Prints button.
 
 The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 14-14. The first 
screen shown in the wizard is a form for you to create an account.
 
 If you try to place an order from your office where the IT department 
prevents you from connecting to some external sources, you may need 
to have your firewall settings adjusted. Talk to someone in your IT 
department to help you make a connection.
 
3. If you haven’t set up an account already, fill in the information and 
step through the wizard by clicking the Next button on each page. If 
you have set up an account, supply your logon information.

328
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 
Figure 14-14: Choose File➪Order Prints to open the Kodak 
 
EasyShare Wizard.
 
 The selected files in the Organizer are automatically loaded in Step 1 of 
the wizard’s order page.
 
4. You can modify your order by deleting files from the order and speci-
fying different print sizes and quantities.
 
 One nice feature in the service is the option for sending duplicate prints 
to another party. You can keep an address book on the provider’s Web 
site and specify whom you want to receive an order. This feature is help-
ful if you’re away spending your children’s inheritance on a Caribbean 
cruise and want to send all your kids photos of the great time you’re 
having. Just pop open your laptop on the pool deck, load the digital 
camera images, and connect via a wireless connection. Before you 
return to Buffalo in midwinter with a suntan, your kids will frown as 
they fan through the prints they received a week earlier.
 
5. Continue stepping through the wizard to upload your files and con-
firm your order, click the Finish button on the last pane, and your 
order is complete.
Exploring Other Print Options
Photoshop Elements provides you with other options for printing things, 
such as video images and contact sheets; adding borders and trim lines; and 
inverting images for heat transfers, such as the ones you may use for iron-on 
T-shirt designs. You can find these options in the Print dialog box. Most of 
these print options are intuitive and easy to use. Just poke around, experi-
ment, and have fun. When it comes time to print, follow the recommenda-
tions we offer here for getting your color right.

E
lements is a great packaging tool that you can use to deploy your photos 
and projects for screen viewing. And that’s not just your computer moni-
tor. You can edit photos or assemble creations that are exported for Web 
viewing, too, and you can even prepare files to show on your television.
In Chapter 3, you can find out about resolutions and color 
modes. The output requirements for printing files, which 
we cover in Chapter 14, are much different from what 
you use for screen viewing.
In this chapter, we cover the options for Web and 
screen viewing that get you started with basics, 
including saving images for the Web (or for screen 
viewing), setting up a slide show, and burning your 
images on CDs or DVDs.
Getting Familiar with the Elements 
Sharing and Printing Options
Before we delve into telling you how to make creations for screen 
viewing, you should be familiar with your available options for not only 
screen images, but also sharing and printing. When you open the Organizer 
and look at the Panels Bin, you see two tabs on the right side at the top of 
the bin for Create and Share. The Create and Share panels are available in the 
Organizer and both Full Edit and Quick Edit modes. Options available to you 
in the panels are identical in each editing space.

330
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
Figure 15-1, shows the menu options for the respective items:
 
✓ Create: The Create tab contains options for creating different kinds of 
projects, such as photo albums, photo calendars, photo collages, online 
photo galleries, and slide shows.
 
✓ Share: The Share tab provides a number of different options for sharing 
photos. On this tab, you find options for developing online photo gal-
leries, e-mailing photos, ordering photo prints, and writing files to CD/
DVDs.
 
 
Figure 15-1: Two panels provide a number of different sharing and 
 
photo creation options.
 
Note that each panel contains a More Options button. Click the button to find 
more creation and sharing options.
In Chapter 14, we talk about ordering online prints by using the Order Prints 
option in the Share panel. In this chapter and in Chapter 16, we cover various 
commands in the Create panel and other options in the Share panel.
Creating a Slide Show
This Million Dollar Baby is no Mystic River — it’s simply Absolute Power! 
Well, maybe you won’t travel the same path from Rowdy Yates to multiple 
Academy Award–winning director and filmmaker Clint Eastwood, but even 
Mr. Eastwood might be impressed with the options for moviemaking with 
the Photoshop Elements slide show creations. When he’s not rolling out his 

331
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
Panaflex camera, he may just want to take photos of the grandkids and do the 
directing and producing, as well as the editing, right in Photoshop Elements.
For the rest of us, we can be our own Clint Eastwood wannabes by using the 
powerful features of the Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor to create PDF 
slide shows and movie files. It’s so easy that Elements promises you won’t be 
Unforgiven.
Creating a project
You create a project file in the Slide Show Editor and then export it for a 
number of different uses. In this section, you can find out how to create 
and save your project. In the following section, you dive into exporting.
Here’s how to create a slide show project that you can edit and export later:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select the pictures you want to use in your 
slide show.
 
2. Click the Create button in the Panels Bin and click Slide Show.
 
 The Slide Show Preferences dialog box opens. Just about everything 
in the dialog box can be adjusted in the Slide Show Editor, so don’t 
worry about making choices here. If you want to keep the Slide Show 
Preferences dialog box from reappearing when you make slide creations, 
deselect the Show This Dialog Each Time a New Slide Show Is Created 
check box.
 
3. Click OK in the Slide Show Preferences dialog box.
 
 The Slide Show Editor opens, as shown in Figure 15-2.
 
4. If your Slide Show Editor doesn’t show you a screen similar to the one 
shown in Figure 15-2, maximize the window by clicking the Maximize 
button in the upper-right corner of the Editor window.
 
 This way, you can see the Storyboard at the bottom of the screen and 
the Panels Bin on the right side of the editor.
 
5. (Optional) Create a Pan & Zoom view.
 
 When slides are shown, you can zoom and pan a slide. Click the Enable 
Pan & Zoom check box and click the Start thumbnail. A rectangle 
appears in the preview area. Move any one of the four corner handles 
in or out to resize the rectangle. Moving the cursor inside the rect-
angle and clicking the mouse button enables you to move the rectangle 
around the preview.
 
 For the end zoom position, click the End thumbnail and size the rectan-
gle to a zoomed view or a view that you want to stop the zoom. Notice in 
Figure 15-2 that the End thumbnail is selected and the rectangle is sized 
down to the zoom area on a portion of the photo.

332
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 
Figure 15-2: The Slide Show Editor is where you create slide shows.
 
6. (Optional) Add a graphic.
 
 A library of graphics appears in the Extras pane in the Panels Bin. Drag 
a graphic to a slide. If you want a blank slide to appear first and then 
add text and graphics to the blank slide, click Add Blank Slide on the 
Shortcuts bar at the top of the Editor.
 
7. (Optional) Add text.
 
 Click the Text tool in the Extras pane in the Panels Bin and drag a text 
style to the blank slide or the opening slide in the slide show. After you 
drag text to a slide, the Properties pane opens in the Panels Bin. The text 
you drag to the slide is placeholder text. To edit the text, click Edit Text 
in the Properties pane. You can also select a font, a font point size, a 
color for the text, text alignment, and a font style. After setting the type 
attributes, click inside the text and move it to the position you want.
 
8. (Optional) Set transitions.
 
 The icons between the slides in the Storyboard (at the bottom of the 
Slide Show Editor) indicate a default transition applied to the slide show. 
You can change transition effects for each slide independently or to all 
the slides in the show. Click the right-pointing arrow on the right side 

333
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
of a transition icon to open a pop-up menu 
containing a number of different transitions, 
as shown in Figure 15-3. If you want to apply 
the same transition to all slides, choose 
Apply to All from the menu commands.
 
 Be conservative with the transition effects. 
Too many transitions of different types can 
make the slide show appear amateurish and 
distracting to the viewers.
 
9. (Optional) Add audio and media.
 
 You can add audio to the slide show by 
choosing Add Media➪Audio from Organizer 
(or from Folder). Select an audio file and 
click OK.
 
 You can also add movie files to your slide 
show. A movie file can be added on top of a 
slide or on a new slide. When the slide show 
is played, the video file plays. Choose Add 
Media➪Photos and Videos from Organizer 
(or from Folder).
 
 This same set of commands can also be used 
to add more pictures to the slide show.
 
10. (Optional) Record your own sounds.
 
 If you want to add narration, click the 
Narration tool (represented by a micro-
phone icon to the right of the Text tool) in 
the Panels Bin, and the Extras panel changes 
to provide you with tools to record a sound 
or import a sound file. Note that this option 
requires you to have a microphone properly 
configured on your computer.
 
11. (Optional) Fit slides to the audio.
 
 If you have 3 minutes of audio and the slide 
duration is 2 minutes 30 seconds, you can, 
with a single mouse click, fit the slide dura-
tion uniformly to fit the 3-minute audio time. 
Just click the Fit Slides to Audio tool below 
the preview image.
 
 If you want to manually adjust time for slide durations, click the down 
arrow on the time readout below the slide thumbnails in the Storyboard.
 
12. Click Save Project on the Shortcuts bar and then, in the dialog box 
that opens, type a name and click Save.
Figure 15-3: Click a right-
pointing arrow on a transition 
to open the Transitions pop-up 
menu.

334
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
 Your project is added to the Organizer and is available for further edit-
ing later. Or, you can open the project to save in a number of different 
output formats, as we explain in the following section.
 
13. Preview the slide show.
 
 Before exporting the slide show, you can see a preview by clicking the 
buttons directly below the image preview area. If you want a full-screen 
preview, click the Preview button on the Shortcuts bar and click the Play 
button.
Exporting to slides and video
After creating a project, you have a number of different output options. You 
can write a project to disc for archival purposes and include slide shows on 
a VideoCD (videodisc) or DVD. You can e-mail a slide show to another user, 
share a project online, write a project compatible for display on a TV, or save 
to either a PDF slide show or Windows movie file.
To write a PDF slide show or a movie file, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer window, double-click the project thumbnail.
 
 The project opens in the Adobe Photoshop Elements Slide Show Editor.
 
2. Click the Output tool on the Shortcuts bar.
 
 The Slide Show Output Wizard opens, as shown in Figure 15-4.
 
 
Figure 15-4: Select Output in the Photoshop Elements Slide Show 
 
Editor to open the Slide Show Output Wizard.
 
3. Select the type of file you want to export to.

335
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
 
 Select Movie File (.wmv) to export a Windows media video file. Your 
exported video can be viewed in Elements or in the Windows Media 
Player. You can import the video in all programs that support .wmv files.
 
 Select PDF File (.pdf) if you want to create a PDF slide show. If you 
create a PDF slide show, some of the animation features, such as zoom-
ing slides and transition effects, aren’t shown in the resultant PDF docu-
ment.
 
4. In the dialog box that opens, which prompts you to add your output 
file to the Organizer, click Yes.
 
 You can now easily view the file by double-clicking it in the Organizer 
window.
Opening multipage PDF files in Elements
If you create a slide show and export the slide show to a PDF document, you 
can open individual PDF pages in Elements. Elements can open any PDF docu-
ment created from any PDF producer. Here’s how:
 
1. In the Organizer, select a file to open and click the Full Edit option on 
the Shortcuts bar.
 
 Be sure to select the file and click Standard Edit. Don’t double-click the 
file in the Organizer; that action opens the file in Adobe Reader.
 
 When the file is opened in Full Edit mode, the Import PDF dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 15-5.
 
 
Figure 15-5: Select a PDF file to open in Elements, and the Import PDF 
 
dialog box opens.

336
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
2. In the dialog box, you can select one or more pages and specify the 
resolution and color mode.
 
 If you want to select several pages in a noncontiguous order, press Ctrl 
(Control on the Mac) while clicking the pages you want to open.
 
3. Click OK to open the PDF pages in individual Image windows.
Writing Creations to CDs and DVDs
You can output creations, such as slide shows and images you optimize for 
TV, to a CD or DVD by using the Slide Show Output Wizard. If you have a 
movie but don’t have a DVD burner, most DVD players sold today enable you 
to view videodiscs written to CDs. The CDs just don’t hold as much content 
as DVDs do.
 
VCDs display at lower resolutions than DVDs. (VCD is an 1150kbps video 
stream with a 352 x 240 resolution for NTSC, and DVD is 720 x 480 at variable 
bitrates between about 3000 and 9800kbps.) You can get 80 minutes of VCD 
on a 700MB CD (74 min on a 650MB).
To write to a CD or DVD, follow these steps:
 
1. Open a project in the Slide Show Output Wizard by double-clicking a 
project in the Organizer.
 
2. Click Output in the Slide Show 
Editor.
 
3. Click Burn to Disc in the Slide 
Show Output Wizard.
 
4. Click OK in the first screen in 
the Slide Show Output Wizard.
 
 If you want to burn additional 
slide shows to the same disc, 
check the Include Additional 
Slide Shows I’ve Made On This 
Disc box. Otherwise, just click 
OK to burn a single slide show 
to a disc.
 
5. Choose a file format.
 
 Click either NTSC or PAL for 
the video format you use, as 
shown in Figure 15-6. NTSC 
is commonly used in the U.S. 
and Japan, whereas PAL is 
Figure 15-6: Type a name and select the format 
to export in the Slide Show Output Wizard.

337
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
commonly used in Europe and other countries. Be certain to check the 
format used by your video players and TV before making a choice here.
 
6. Click OK.
 
 The Burn dialog box opens, and your CD drive door on your computer 
opens.
 
7. Insert a CD and click OK.
 
 The status bar shows the writing progress.
After the CD or DVD finishes writing, pop open your CD/DVD drive and 
remove the disc. Place the disc in your DVD player and press Play. The 
movie automatically starts playing, like any commercial videodisc.
Showing Your Files on the Web
Another option for screen-viewing your photos is to display them on the 
Web. With Photoshop Elements, you don’t need to know a hoot about Web 
page design and HTML coding. Elements creates all you need to upload 
attractive collections to your personal Web site. In addition, all the editing 
tools you need to prepare files for other kinds of Web hosting are all con-
tained in Elements. Regardless of whether you want to display galleries of 
images or host images on your own personal blog, Elements provides you all 
the editing opportunities.
Creating an online photo album
Galleries of images are usually added to Web sites with links and/or anima-
tion. You can prepare an online gallery of images, and Elements handles all 
the HTML coding you need to show an attractive display of your pictures 
with a professional look.
To see how easy it is to create a Web page showing off your photos, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select the photos you want to display on your 
Web site.
 
2. Click Share in the Panels Bin and choose Online Album from the 
panel options.
 
 The Online Gallery panel opens in the Panels Bin.
 
3. Drag photos from the Organizer to the Online Album panel.
 
 If you created an album, as we explain in Chapter 6, you can open the 
Organizer, click the Organize button in the Panels Bin, and click the 

338
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
album you created for showing photos online. This option prevents you 
from having to sort through the Organizer window to find photos you 
want to add to the online gallery.
  
 You can first select photos in the Organizer, then click Share and click 
Online Album. All the selected photos are added to a new album.
 
4. Choose what you want to share to.
 
 The first pane in the new creation is the Album Details. In this pane, you 
make a choice for distributing your album to Photoshop.com, to a CD/
DVD, or to an FTP site. Click the radio button of your choice, as shown 
in Figure 15-7.
 
 
Figure 15-7: Make a choice for sharing and click Next to see a preview of your gallery.
 
5. Choose a template.
 
 Click Change Template to expand the Online Gallery panel to display a 
number of templates you can use for your gallery. Select a template and 
click Next to move to the next pane.
 
6. Select options for your album.

339
 Chapter 15: Showing It Onscreen
 
 If you choose to distribute on Photoshop.com, you need to log into your 
account. If you choose another option, fill in the fields for title, subtitle, 
and e-mail address.
 
7. Click Next.
 
 A preview of your gallery appears, complete with animation effects. 
Review the file.
 
8. Save your gallery.
 
9. Click Next and upload the file to Photoshop.com or an FTP site, or 
burn a CD/DVD.
If you can’t get a connection to your FTP site by using Elements, use an FTP 
program to upload files. Be certain to upload the entire folder that Elements 
created for you. Inside this folder is the index.html file Elements created. 
You can add links from other Web pages to this file and host a series of differ-
ent creations, all made visible with different Web links.
Flip ’Em Over with Flipbooks
Below the buttons for different create and share items in both the Create 
and Share panels, you can find a More Options button. Click More Options to 
open a menu where additional create/share items are found. With regard to 
the Create panel, the More Options menu contains a number of items, such 
as CD/DVD jackets and labels, VCD with a menu, and a flipbook.
At the bottom of the More Options menu in the Create panel, you can find 
a Flipbook option. If you want to create a quick little video that shows off 
your photos by flashing stills on your screen or your TV set, you can quickly 
create a flipbook. Here’s how you do it:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select the files you want to use.
 
 Note that you must select at least two files in order to create the 
flipbook.
 
2. Click the Create tab in the Panels Bin and choose More 
Options➪Flipbook.
 
 The Photoshop Elements Video Flipbook opens, as shown in Figure 15-8.
 
3. Set the playback speed by typing a value in the Speed text box or 
moving the slider to the desired speed.

Figure 15-8: The Photoshop Elements Video Flipbook dialog box 
 
permits you to select a speed and movie file size.
 
 Note that flipping through photos looks best at low speeds, such as 1 or 
2 frames per second (fps). Also, you can select the size for your video 
file from options on the Movie File Size drop-down menu.
 
4. Click Output.
 
 The Save Video Flipbook dialog box opens.
 
5. Type a filename and click Save.
Your file is written as a .wmv file. You can use Microsoft Movie Maker to

Making Creations and Sharing
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding common creation assembly
▶ Creating photo album pages
▶ Constructing greeting cards and postcards
▶ Making your own CD and DVD labels
▶ Using sharing services
▶ Examining other online services
A
dobe Photoshop Elements offers you a number of creations that can be 
shared onscreen or in print. From both the Create and Share panels in 
the Panels Bin in the Organizer and both editing modes, you have a number 
of menu choices for making creations designed for sharing.
In Chapter 15, we look at creating files for screen and Web 
viewing. In this chapter, we talk about creations designed 
for print and sharing. It’s all here in Elements, but 
shhhhh. Don’t tell the Photoshop people because 
Photoshop doesn’t have all these wonderful creation 
features.
Getting a Grip on 
Assembling Creations
In Chapter 15, we talk about slide shows, videodiscs, 
online galleries, and video flipbooks. These creations 
offer different output options, such as e-mailing, burning 
files to disc, and creating HTML documents — as well as print-
ing and PDF creation.

342
Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
You work with the remaining creations — Photo Books, Photo Collages, 
Photo Calendars, Greeting Cards, E-mail Attachments, various sorts of online 
sharing, and PhotoStamps — by choosing options from the Create and Share 
panels. All these creations are designed for output to your printer or for 
sending files to an online printing service, or friends and family.
 
When you make a creation that will ultimately be sent to an online service or 
shared with other users, keep in mind that you first must select the photos you 
want in your creation. For example, 
creating a Photo Book by clicking the 
Photo Book button in the Create panel 
first requires you to select photos to 
let Elements know what photos are 
to be used in your photo book. If you 
happen to click a button and nothing 
happens, more than likely, you haven’t 
selected any photos.
Many creation options follow a simi-
lar set of steps to produce a file that 
will be shared with other users or 
sent to an online printing service. 
In the Panels Bin, you can find all 
you need to make a new project 
by making choices for layouts and 
producing a creation. Among some 
of the common tasks you’ll find 
when making a choice from both the 
Create and Share panels are
 
✓ Layout options: Select some 
photos in the Organizer and 
click an item, such as Photo 
Book, to make the Create panel 
change to the Project view. This 
view displays some information 
about making a new creation.
 
 Read the help information 
and click Next to arrive at the 
second panel, as shown in 
Figure 16-1. At the top of the 
panel, your first choice is a 
layout option. Click the radio 
button for either Random Photo 
Layout or Choose Photo Layout. 
Below the radio button choices, 
you find a set of templates in a 
scrollable window.
Figure 16-1: The Panels Bin contains all the 
options you need to create a new project.

343
 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
 
✓ Auto-Fill with Project Bin Photos: By default, this check box is selected, 
and the files you see in the Project Bin will be added to your project.
 
✓ Include Captions: Select this check box if you want the photo captions 
to appear on each page below their respective photos.
 
✓ Number of Pages: Elements automatically creates the number of pages 
to accommodate the number of photos you selected in the Organizer. 
Note that some creations require a minimum number of photos to 
produce a project. Photo Book, for example, requires a minimum of 
18 pages.
After assembling your creation, click the Done button. Elements then adds 
the selected photos to the layout and the theme you specified in the panel. 
Be patient and wait for Elements to complete the task.
After a creation has been made, the document appears like any other image 
you open in Elements. You can crop, modify, and print images, and more. 
Using an Elements file, you choose File➪Save to open the Save As dialog box. 
Type a name and click Save.
Creating a Photo Book
Elements provides some fancy ways to create pages for a photo album. In 
the Photo Book creation panel, you have many different options for choosing 
page templates, adding artwork and type, printing your album pages, or 
sending the files to an online service for professional printing.
Follow these steps to create a Photo Book:
 
1. Select files in the Organizer and click the Create tab.
 
 The procedure for all creations is the same. You first select files in the 
Organizer (or an editing mode) and then click the Create tab in the 
Panels Bin. Ideally, it’s best to create an album, as we explain in Chapter 
6, and click the album to display the album photos in the Organizer 
window. But remember, after you display an album in the Organizer, you 
still need to select all the photos.
 
 To select all photos shown in an Organizer window, press Ctrl+A 
(Control+A on the Mac).
 
2. Click Photo Book in the Create panel.
 
 Regardless of whether you’re working in the Organizer or an editing 
mode, the Photo Book option is available in the same Create panel. The 
Create panel changes to the first of several panes that walk you through 
the steps to create a Photo Book. If you start in the Organizer, clicking 
Photo Book in the Create panel opens your selected photos in Full Edit 
mode.

3. Choose a photo for the title page.
 
 The first photo in the Project Bin in Full Edit mode is the photo that’s 
used for the title page in your Photo Book. To change the photo to a dif-
ferent image you want to use for the title page, drag the thumbnail image 
in the Project Bin to the first position.
 
4. Click Next and choose a layout.
 
5. Click Next in the Create panel 
to select a theme for your 
Photo Book.
 
 The third pane in the Create 
panel provides options for 
choosing a theme and photo 
layout for your book pages. 
Select a theme from the scrol-
lable list in the panel.
 
6. (Optional) Click the Include 
Captions check box.
 
 Follow this step only if you want 
photo captions to appear below 
your images.
 
7. Click Create.
 
 Wait a few minutes while 
Elements lays out the page or 
pages. After the pages are cre-
ated and the photos are added 
to your layout, the Projects 
panel changes to the Artwork 
panel, where you can choose 
from various options to add 
artwork to your pages, such as 
creating frames and drop shad-
ows, adding text, adding clip 
art, and masking images with 
various stencils. In Figure 16-2, 
a drop-down menu shows various options for changing backgrounds; 
adding frames, graphics, shapes, and text; and changing themes. With 
each selection you make from the drop-down menu, the panel changes 
to display choices for the menu item selected.
 
8. (Optional) Add text to a page.
 
 Choose Text from the drop-down menu, shown in Figure 16-2, and drag 
a text font and style to the page where you want to add text or click the 
Apply button in the panel. For example, you may want to add a caption 
to the title page. After dragging the text frame (or selecting text and 
clicking Apply) to the page, delete the default text and type new text.

9. As with any other Elements file, choose File➪Save to save the project.
All the options in the Artwork panel are used in the same manner. For exam-
ple, if you want to change the background artwork, choose Backgrounds from 
the menu shown in Figure 16-2. Click a background from the panel and drag 
the background to the page you want to edit. (Note that you can also select a 
background and click the Apply button.) When adding frames and shadows 
to your pictures, choose Frames from the menu and drag a frame to a picture 
on a page, or select a frame and click Apply.
Elements provides you with many different editing options for creating the 
design for your photo pages. Try to spend some time choosing different 
options in the Artwork panel and drag items (or select them and click Apply) 
to the pages to see how easy it is to change your Photo Book appearance.
After you create a Photo Book, you can print the album pages to your desk-
top printer or click the Order button in the Image window, where a book page 
appears. When you click Order, you can place an online order for a profes-
sionally printed book that will be mailed to you.
 
When you edit an image on a photo page, a bar with two icons appears above 
the image. The check mark icon is used to accept the edit you make. The 
circle with a diagonal line represents a Cancel button. Click the button to 
cancel your edits.
Greetings!
Creating greeting cards follows the same steps as creating a Photo Book with 
similar panel options. As with your options for photo albums, you select a 
template and a theme.
Follow these steps to create your own, personal greeting cards:
 
1. Open the Organizer and select a photo.
 
2. Click More Options to open the More Options menu and click Greeting 
Card.
 
 Full Edit mode opens with the Create panel showing similar options to 
those available with Photo Book creations.
 
3. Select a theme and layout.
 
 Select a theme from the Choose a Theme scrollable window and select a 
layout from the Choose a Layout scrollable window, as shown in 
Figure 16-3.

4. Click Done.
 
 The photo shown in the Project Bin (the one 
you selected in the Organizer window in 
Step 1) is placed on a design you chose from 
the Choose a Theme and Choose a Layout 
options in Step 3. The design appears in a 
new Image window, where you can use all 
the editing tools.
 
5. Add some type.
 
 Click the Type tool and add some text to the 
card, as shown in Figure 16-4.
 
6. Save the file.
 
When you create a project and add photos to your project pages, the photos 
are added as new layers. If you want to add text or make edits with the Tools 
panel, you can click the Edit tab and use the same tools on a project as you 
use in other editing sessions. In other words, you’re not restricted to using 
just the text options you find in the Artwork panel if you want to add text in a 
different font and style.

Creating CD and DVD Labels
Another creation option in Elements is the simple, easy way to create CD and 
DVD labels. From the Create panel, click More Options and choose a menu 
item for CD Jacket, DVD Jacket, or CD/DVD Label. From templates provided 
in the panel, Elements offers you an easy method for printing your own, per-
sonal labels and jackets for CDs and DVDs.
 
This feature for printing CD/DVD labels is a bit weak in Elements. You may 
need to fiddle around quite a bit to get the images to fit a label. Using some 
templates provided by the label developers is often a much better method 
for printing labels.
Spreading the Love through Sharing
Several methods of sharing your creations are available in Elements. You can 
use the new Adobe-hosted Photoshop.com service, place print orders with 
third-party online services, or e-mail photo files to friends.
Going online with photoshop.com
 
Adobe has now made it super convenient and easy for you to share your 
favorite images online with the new Photoshop.com service. Although 
it’s available only in the United States right now, Adobe plans on eventu-
ally extending the service to other countries. In addition to photo sharing, 
Photoshop.com offers automated backup and synchronization of your files, 
which enables you to manage your photos and other media assets online 
from any Web browser.
Creating a photoshop.com account
If you’re a U.S. resident, you can sign up for a free account and share photos 
and videos via your own, personal Web page. You can set up an account from 
the Elements Welcome screen or from the Editor or Organizer.
Follow these steps to set up a photoshop.com account:
 
1. At the Elements Welcome screen, click the Join Now button on the 
Photoshop.com Membership panel, which appears on the left of the 
window.
 
 If you blew by the Welcome screen, you can also click the Join Now 
button in the top-right of either the Editor or Organizer window (Mac 
users need to use Adobe Bridge).

2. Fill out the usual form fields — name, e-mail address, and password. 
Then enter your personal URL.
 
 This URL will be your personal Web address for displaying and sharing 
your photos and videos online.
 
3. Click Create Account.
 
4. Choose a free Basic account, which gives you up to 5MB in storage, or 
a Plus account, which gives you additional storage options and other 
added features (for a fee). Click Done.
 
 An e-mail is sent to you.
 
5. Reply to the e-mail to activate your account, and you’re ready to go.
Sharing a photo album online
To share a photo album, you simply need to mark the album as Shared in 
Elements. Shared albums are then uploaded to your Photoshop.com account 
and displayed on your personal URL.
Follow these steps to share a photo album online:
 
1. On the Organize panel, select an existing photo album name and then 
click the Share icon to the right of the album’s name.
 
 To create a new online album, click the Online Album button on the 
Share panel. Or, you can click the Add icon on the Organize tab, select 
New Album, and then select Share To: Photoshop.com. Then click the 
Add Photos button (the plus sign [+] icon) in the gallery section and 
drag and drop your desired photos to the Add photos panel.
 
2. Customize the title and subtitle, change your background color, and 
show any captions, if desired. Click Next.
 
3. In the Album Details panel, click Change Template to change your 
photo gallery template, if desired. Select Photoshop.com to share your 
photos online.
 
 You can also choose to export your photos to CD/DVD or an FTP site.
 
4. Click Next.
 
5. Specify your sharing options, as shown in Figure 16-5.
 
 Choose whether to share your photos publicly or by invitation only via 
e-mail. For invites only, type your message and specify your invitees. 
Choose whether viewers can download or order prints of the photos.
 
6. Click Share.
 
 Elements cranks away and then gives you a message that your album 
has been created and will be available after the upload is complete. A 
completed online photo album displayed on Photoshop.com is shown in 
Figure 16-6.

 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
Here are a few other tidbits 
regarding online albums:
 
✓ Albums are listed on the 
Organize panel with an online 
album icon to the right of the 
name.
 
✓ To make changes to an album, 
right-click (Control-click on the 
Mac) the album name.
 
✓ To stop sharing an album, 
select the album in the 
Organize pane and click the 
Stop Sharing icon to the right of 
the name.
 
✓ When you add or delete images 
from your online album, 
Elements automatically updates 
your photo album online.
 
✓ Click the Web Gallery button 
on the Elements Welcome 
screen to be transported to 
Photoshop.com, where you can 
view online albums.
Backing up and synchronizing 
your files
Photoshop.com enables you to back 
up and synchronize your files. Why 
would you want to back up and 
synchronize? First of all, it lets you 
access your photos and other media 
assets from any Web browser by 
using your Photoshop.com account, 
which you may find useful if you travel a lot or just like to be able to access 
your home images from work, or vice versa. Any changes you make — adding, 
deleting, reorganizing, or editing photos — are synchronized back to your 
Photoshop Elements desktop. If you edit your images, they don’t overwrite 
your originals on your desktop, but instead create a version set, thereby 
giving you the option of using the original or the edited version.
Secondly, if your computer crashes and burns, you can restore your catalog 
to a new computer by logging onto your Photoshop.com account. Then simply 
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Backup/Synchronization, select the albums you 
want restored to your new computer by selecting the Sync check box next to 
each album, and click OK.
Figure 16-5: Share your photo album online.

Part V: Printing, Creating, and Sharing 
 
Figure 16-6: View online albums.
Follow these steps to set up your Backup/Synchronization preferences:
 
1. Log on to your Photoshop.com account.
 
2. On the Elements Welcome screen, click the Backup Settings button in 
the Photoshop.com Membership panel on the left.
 
 You can also choose Edit➪Preferences➪Backup/Synchronization in the 
Organizer (Adobe Bridge for Mac users).
 
3. In the Backup/Synchronization preferences panel, specify your 
options.
 
 For example, when deleting a file online, you may want Elements to ask 
whether you want to delete that file from your computer, instead of 
Elements deleting the file automatically.
 
4. Click OK.
Getting help with Elements from photoshop.com
Photoshop.com offers you a lot of help via tutorials that Adobe and other 
Elements users have uploaded. Click the Tutorials button on the Elements 
Welcome screen to launch the Adobe Inspiration browser, which delivers 
you to the Tutorials doorstep.

 Chapter 16: Making Creations and Sharing
Ordering prints online
Right from within your Photoshop Elements workspace, you can place orders 
for prints, Photo Books, and greeting cards, and then have your creations 
mailed to you and any number of friends and colleagues.
For online print orders, select the photos you want to order and click Order 
Prints in the Share panel.
The Kodak EasyShare Wizard opens, where you add the order and logon 
information, and then submit your order. The steps are straightforward and 
intuitive. In addition to having your prints mailed to you, you can also add 
other recipients in the Order Prints Wizard. Elements makes it easy to send 
photos to family members living across the country.
E-mailing creations
After you put together a creation with the Creation Wizard, you can e-mail 
the creation to your friends, family, or whomever you want by choosing a 
simple menu command. (We introduce this method and other ways to share 
creations in the section “Getting a Grip on Assembling Creations,” earlier 
in this chapter.) Additionally, you can e-mail photos to mobile phones. The 
options are all located in the Share panel.
Rather than save your file from Elements and then open your e-mail client 
and select the photo to attach to an e-mail message, you can use Elements to 
easily share photos via e-mail with one click.
When you want to e-mail a creation, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Organizer, select the photos you want to e-mail to a friend.
 
2. Open the Share panel and select E-mail Attachments.
 
 The first time you select E-mail Attachments, a dialog box opens, 
prompting you to select your e-mail client.
 
3. If you’re using this feature 
for the first time, select your 
e-mail client in the dialog box 
and click Continue.
 
 You can use your own e-mail 
client, Windows Mail, or the 
Adobe E-Mail Service, as shown 
in Figure 16-7. If you select 
Adobe E-Mail Service, your cre-
ation e-mails are sent through 
Elements’ built-in service, so 
Adobe serves as your e-mail 
client. If you select Adobe E-Mail Service, you need to log on to the service.

you want to send your creation.

 Click Continue, and the panel changes to the 
view shown in Figure 16-8.
 
4. In this panel, select the size and quality of 
your prints, and then click Next.
 
5. In the panel that appears, specify
 
• Message: In an optional item, type the 
text that you want to appear in your 
e-mail message in the Message window.
 
• Select Recipients: You can add recipi-
ents by clicking the Edit Contacts 
button on the top-right side of the 
Select Recipients panel and adding 
names and e-mail addresses. Select 
the check box adjacent to the name of 
each recipient with whom you want to 
share your photos.
 
• Save As Quick Share Flow: The default 
is No. Leave the setting at the default 
if you want to just attach a file to an 
e-mail message. If you want to save the 
file configuration, you can choose Yes, 
and the file appears in the Quick Share panel at the bottom of the 
Share panel.
 
6. Click Next.
 
 Your images are prepared according to the attributes specified in 
the Share panel. The files you selected are attached to a new e-mail 
message.
 
7. Click the Send button in your e-mail client.
 
 The photos are e-mailed to the recipients you identified.
 
By default, Elements uses your primary e-mail client application, which may 
or may not be the e-mail program you use. You can change the default e-mail 
client by pressing Ctrl+K (Control+K on the Mac) to open the Preferences 
dialog box when you’re in the Organizer and then clicking Sharing in the left 
pane. From a drop-down list in the Sharing preferences, select the e-mail 
client application that you want Elements to use.
Using Photo Mail
Another form of e-mailing files to your friends and family is using the Photo 
Mail options in the Share panel. Click one or more photos in the Organizer 
window and open the Share panel. Click the Photo Mail button in the Share 
panel, and the panel changes to display the photos you selected in the 
Figure 16-8: Click the Share 
panel and select E-Mail 
Attachments to open this panel.

Organizer. You can add photos by clicking the plus sign (+) icon or delete 
photos by selecting them in the panel and clicking the minus sign (–) icon.
Click the Next button, and you arrive at the second panel in Photo Mail. 
Add a message and select recipients much like you do when ordering online 
prints. Click Next, and you arrive at a pane in which you can add or edit a 
design template. Select from options in the left side of the pane and add ele-
ments you like to create a polished design.
When finished with your design, click Next Step, and you arrive at a pane 
in which you can change the layout and make selections for the font used 
in your design, as shown in Figure 16-9. Click Next, and the file is added as 
a new e-mail attachment. Open your default e-mail client and click Send/
Receive.

to help you take your photography and 
Elements skills a little further. In Chapter 17, you

photos. Find out about the rule of thirds, framing, 
and other simple tricks that can make your photos

Ten Tips for Composing 
Better Photos
In This Chapter
▶ Finding a focal point and using the rule of thirds
▶ Cutting the clutter and framing your shot
▶ Employing contrast, leading lines, and viewpoints
▶ Using light and giving direction
▶ Considering direction of movement
A
 few things have to come together to make a great photograph. One is 
being in the right place at the right time. Another is the ability to 
tell a story. Yet another is excellent composition. Unfortunately, 
we can’t help with your schedule or storytelling, but we can 
give you several easy tips on how to take photographs 
that are interesting and well composed. Some of these 
tips overlap and contain common concepts. But 
they’re all free; they don’t require any extra money 
or equipment. They require only an open mind and 
an eye that’s willing to be trained over time.
Find a Focal Point
One of the most important tools for properly compos-
ing a photo is establishing a focal point — a main point 
of interest. If too many elements are competing for atten-
tion, a photo probably doesn’t have a clearly defined focal 
point. Your eye, therefore, doesn’t know where to look. Too 
many images without a focal point cause the viewer to tire quickly or 
lose interest. The eye wants to be drawn to a subject.

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Excessive background elements, such as furniture, walls, tables, fences, 
buildings, and even random bystanders, don’t add much to the composi-
tional or emotional value of your shot. What you really want to capture are 
the smiles and expressions of your family and friends.
 
Keep these tips in mind to help find your focal point:
 
✓ Pick your subject and then get close to it.
 
✓ Include a point of interest in scenic shots. Sunrises and sunsets are 
pretty, but after you’ve seen a few, you’ve seen them all. Try to capture 
an early morning fisherman casting his line off the pier or a child check-
ing out a rogue hermit crab at dusk. That potentially ho-hum scenic shot 
now has some visual punch.
 
✓ When it’s appropriate, try to include an element in the foreground, 
middle ground, or background to add depth and a sense of scale. Just 
make sure that it’s a meaningful element and not random clutter, as 
shown in Figure 17-1.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos
Use the Rule of Thirds
After you find a focal point for your 
shot, the next step is to try to put 
that focal point, or subject, in a 
prime location within your view-
finder or LCD display. Those prime 
locations are based on the photo-
graphic principle called the rule of 
thirds. If you divide an image into 
a grid of nine equal segments, as 
shown in Figure 17-2, the elements 
most appealing to the eye and most 
likely to be noticed first are those 
that fall close to one of the four inter-
sections of the dividing lines.
When you’re composing your shot, 
try to mentally divide your frame into vertical and horizontal thirds and 
position your most important visual element at any intersecting point. When 
you’re shooting landscapes, remember that a low horizon creates a dreamy 
and spacious feeling and that a high horizon gives an earthy and intimate 
feeling. For close-up portraits, try putting the face or eyes of a person at one 
of those points.
If the rule of thirds is too hard for you to remember or employ, when you 
look through the viewfinder, just repeat the mantra “Move from center.” 
We all have a natural tendency to want to center everything. Get it nice and 
orderly. But centered subjects are often static and boring. Asymmetry often 
gives you more dynamic and interesting images.
 
If you have an autofocus camera, you need to lock the focus when you’re 
moving from center because the autofocus sensor locks onto whatever’s 
in the center of the viewfinder — not on your point of interest. Autofocus 
can also be problematic when you’re trying to do something as simple as 
photographing two people (in this case, you may want the two people in 
the center) and your camera keeps focusing on the space in the distance 
between them. Center your subject in the viewfinder and apply slight pres-
sure to your shutter release button to lock the focus. Then, reposition your 
subject at an intersecting point on the rule-of-thirds grid and press down all 
the way to snap the photo.
Cut the Clutter
Contrary to what you see on supermarket tabloid covers, those telephone 
poles, branches, car antennas, and other everyday objects don’t naturally 
grow out of people’s heads. Although these mergers, as photographers call

them, are good for a laugh, they’re not good enough to make it into picture 
frames and scrapbooks.
Here are some ways you can cut the clutter from your background:
 
✓ Get up close and personal. Most people worry about getting their 
heads cut off when they get their photos taken. But more often than 
not, people tend to capture too much boring or distracting background. 
Fill your viewfinder frame with your subject. Although you can always 
crop your image later, you should try to get your subject to fill the frame 
when you take the photo.
 
✓ Shoot at a different angle. Yes, you can turn your camera! Most photos 
are horizontal merely because it’s easier to hold the camera that way. 
That’s fine for a lot of shots (such as the requisite group photo and some 
landscape shots), but other subjects (buildings, trees, waterfalls, moun-
tain peaks, giraffes, Shaquille O’Neal) lend themselves to a vertical format.
 
✓ Move around your subject. Moving around may help eliminate 
unwanted clutter. Shoot from below or above your subject, if necessary.
 
✓ Move your subject, if possible, to get the optimum background. 
Although there are exceptions, an ideal background is usually free from 
distracting elements, such as tree branches, poles, wires, chain-link 
fences, signs, bright lights, a lot of loud colors, busy wallpaper, and so 
on. Include only what complements your subject.
 
✓ Use background elements to enhance, not distract. On the other hand, 
if your background is interest-
ing and can make your photo 
stronger, include it. You can 
use famous landmarks, props, 
and even decorations in the 
background to give context to 
images, as shown in Figure 17-3.
 
✓ Use space around a subject to 
evoke a certain mood. A lot 
of space around a person can 
give a sense of loneliness, just 
as a closely cropped portrait 
can create a feeling of intimacy. 
Just make sure that the space is 
intentionally used in the shot.
 
✓ If you’re stuck with a distract-
ing background, you can try 
blurring it by using a wider 
aperture (such as f/4, rather than f/11 or f/16) on your camera. This 
makes the depth of field (areas of sharpness in relation to your focal point) 
shallower so that your subject is in focus but the background isn’t.
Figure 17-3: Use background elements, such as 
decorations, to help define an event and add 
ambience to the subject

361
 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos
 
 Because consumer digital cameras use image sensors that are typically 
one-third the size of a 35mm frame, the lens is very close to the sensor, 
which really increases the depth of field. This deep depth of field can 
make blurring the background difficult. Not a problem — you can also 
blur the background by making a selection and using the Blur filter in 
Elements. See Chapters 7 and 10 for more on selections and the Blur 
filter, respectively.
Frame Your Shot
When it’s appropriate, use foreground elements 
to frame your subject. Frames lead you into a 
photograph. You can use elements, such as tree 
branches, windows, archways, and doorways, 
to frame a wide or long shot, add a feeling of 
depth, and create a point of reference, as shown 
in Figure 17-4. You don’t have to reserve the use 
of framing for wide and long shots, however. 
Close-ups can also be framed. Your framing ele-
ments don’t always have to be sharply focused. 
Sometimes, if they’re too sharp, they distract 
from the focal point. And, remember to avoid 
mergers!
Employ Contrast
Just remember “Light on dark, dark 
on light.” A light subject has more 
impact and emphasis if it’s shot 
against a dark background, and vice 
versa, as shown in Figure 17-5. When 
people view an image, their eyes go 
first to the area of the most contrast. 
Obviously, finding contrast in the 
environment is sometimes beyond 
your control. But when you’re setting 
up a shot, you can certainly try to 
incorporate this technique. Keep in 
mind, however, that contrast needs 
to be used carefully. Sometimes, it 
can be distracting, especially if the 
high-contrast elements aren’t your 
main point of interest.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Use Leading Lines
Leading lines are lines that, by either 
the actual elements in the image or 
the composition of those elements, 
lead the eye into the picture and, 
hopefully, to a point of interest. 
These lines add dimension, depth, 
and perspective by carrying the eye 
through the photo:
 
✓ Diagonal lines are dynamic and 
evoke movement.
 
✓ Curves are graceful and 
harmonious.
 
✓ Horizontal lines are peaceful 
and give a feeling of balance.
 
✓ Vertical lines are direct and 
active.
The best leading lines are those that 
enter the image from the lower-left 
corner. Many elements provide 
natural leading lines, especially in 
scenic or landscape photos, such as 
roads, walls, fences, rivers, shadows, 
skyscrapers, and bridges. The photo 
shown in Figure 17-6 of the Great Wall of China is an example of curved 
leading lines.
Experiment with Viewpoints
Not much in the world looks fascinating photographed from a height of 5 to 
6 feet off the ground. Unfortunately, this is the viewpoint of “Snapshotville.” 
Try to break out of this mode by taking photos from another vantage point. 
Experiment with taking a photo from above the subject (bird’s-eye view) or 
below it (worm’s-eye view). A different angle may provide a more interesting 
image:

find leading lines, although you may not find a 
longer unbroken curve than the Great Wall.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos
 
✓ Unexpected angles can exag-
gerate the size of the subject. 
The subject may appear either 
larger or smaller than normal, 
as shown in Figure 17-7. Try 
extreme angles with scenic 
shots, which otherwise can tend 
to be rather static or boring.
 
✓ Changing your viewpoint can 
change the mood of the image. 
If the photo in Figure 17-7 had 
been taken from a front angle, 
it would’ve been pretty dull. 
Taken from below, looking up, 
exaggerates the height and 
makes for a stronger and more 
exciting composition, making 
the cactus seem like nature’s 
skyscraper.
 
✓ Use direct eye contact when 
you’re photographing people. 
It provides a sense of realism 
and makes the image more inti-
mate and warm, pulling you into 
the photo. But remember that 
children are not at the same eye 
level as adults. We often shoot 
down at them, making them 
appear smaller than they really are. Try kneeling or sitting on the floor 
and getting down to their level. You’ll also find that you get a less dis-
tracting background in the frame, and the lighting from your flash more 
evenly covers the face. Do the same for pets and other short-stature 
subjects, such as flowers.
Use Light
When we think of light in regard to photography, the first thing that comes to 
mind are all those photos we took in the past that are either overexposed (too 
light) or underexposed (too dark). With lighting, you have to consider not 
only whether you have the right amount of lighting but also these factors:
 
✓ The direction of the light
 
✓ The intensity of the light
 
✓ The color of the light

angles can exaggerate size, resulting in a more 
interesting shot.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Natural light (outdoors) or artificial light (indoors)
 
✓ Creative use of lighting to lead the eye and create a certain mood
If the light isn’t right for your shot, you have quite a few choices: Hurry up 
and wait, move yourself, move the subject, add more light with a flash, or 
diffuse the light. Of course, which one you choose depends on the circum-
stances of the shot and what’s convenient or most productive. Here are a few 
tips to remember about light:
 
✓ The best light for photographs is in the early morning and later after-
noon. The light is warmer and softer, and the shadows are longer and 
less harsh.
 
✓ Avoid taking portraits at midday. The overhead sun causes ugly shad-
ows and makes people squint. If you must shoot then, use a reflector to 
block some of the sunlight or fill in the shadow areas. Or, you can use a 
scrim (white translucent fabric stretched across a frame) to diffuse the 
light.
 
✓ Cloudy or overcast days can be great for photographing, especially 
portraits. The light is soft and diffused and flatters the face.
 
✓ Shooting subjects with backlighting (where the lighting comes from 
behind the subject) can produce dramatic results. Figure 17-8 shows 
an example. If you want to see the details of the subject, and not just a 
silhouette, use a fill flash to lighten the shadow areas.

 Chapter 17: Ten Tips for Composing Better Photos
 
✓ Ensure that the brightest light source isn’t directed right into the lens. 
This causes lens flare, those strange light circles that appear in the photo.
 
✓ Take into account the color of the light. The light at noon is white, the 
light at sunset is orange, and the light at twilight is blue. The color of the 
light can make an image feel warm or cool.
 
✓ Use a flash when necessary. Use a flash in low-light conditions. If your 
built-in flash isn’t cutting the mustard, you may want to invest in an 
accessory flash.
 
✓ Get creative with light. Look for those 
unique compositions created by the inter-
play between light and shadow areas, or 
how the light illuminates a particular sub-
ject. Lighting by itself can make or break a 
certain mood or emotion. Think of a simple 
beam of light coming through the roof of 
an old barn. Even in the lousiest weather, 
the most beautifully lit images can emerge. 
When wet objects are lit, they seem to shim-
mer, as shown in Figure 17-9.
Give Direction
When you look at magazines that feature the 
year’s best photos, they all appear as instances 
of pure serendipity. Sometimes that’s the case, 
but more often than not, the photographer arranged the shot or waited for 
the right light or a special moment.
As a photographer, you also shouldn’t be afraid to play photo stylist:
 
✓ Give directions on where you 
want people to stand, how to 
stand, and so on. For example, 
tell people to touch each other, 
bring their heads toward 
each other, or put their arms 
around each other, as shown in 
Figure 17-10.
 
✓ Designate the location.
 
✓ Arrange people around props, 
such as trees or cars.
 
✓ Use a variety of poses. Have 
some people sit and others 
stand.

you’re photographing while also trying to 
capture their personalities.

366
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ If you’re dealing with a large group of people, rambunctious kids, or 
excited pets, get someone to help direct. Just make sure that the par-
ties being photographed pay attention and look at the camera.
 
✓ Try to get people to relax. Although spontaneity can yield great images, 
you can still get good photos from posed subjects if they aren’t hating 
the experience.
Consider Direction of Movement
When the subject is capable of 
movement, such as a car, person, 
or animal, make sure that you leave 
more space in front of the subject 
than behind it, as shown in Figure 
17-11. Otherwise, the viewer may 
subconsciously experience a feel-
ing of departure or discomfort. You 
want to try to give the person or 
object room to move into the frame. 
Likewise, if a person is looking out 
onto a vista, make sure that you 
include that vista so that the person is 
given a point of view and the scene 
is given context.

Ten More Project Ideas
In This Chapter
▶ Decorating your computer screen
▶ Advertising in flyers and online auctions
▶ Decorating your duds
▶ Going big with posters
▶ Creating a household inventory or project documentation
▶ Sprucing up your homework
S
o, you posted all your holiday and vacation photos in an online gallery 
and made enough photo books, slide shows, flipbooks, and greeting 
cards to keep your family and friends content for months to come? Sounds 
like you may be ready to take a crack at some other projects. In this 
chapter, you can find some ideas on how you can use your 
inventory of digital images to make your life more produc-
tive, more organized, and more fun. Remember that this 
chapter just scratches the surface. With a little imagi-
nation, before you know it, there won’t be anything 
left in your life that doesn’t include your photos.
Wallpaper and Screen Savers
If you like an image so much that you want to gaze 
at it while you’re toiling away at your computer, why 
not use that image for the background of your com-
puter, better known as the desktop wallpaper? If you 
can’t choose just one favorite image, you can use several 
to create a multi-image screen saver.
 
If you’re serious about image editing, you really should have a neutral 
gray background. But as long as your wallpaper isn’t showing while you do 
your color corrections, feel free to decorate your desktop with your favorite 
colorful photo. Follow these two easy steps to turn a photo into wallpaper:

368
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
1. From the Organizer, select the photo you want to use.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Set as Desktop Wallpaper.
That’s all there is to it! Your photo has now been transformed into desktop 
wallpaper.
If you have two or more photos you want to use, you can create a Windows 
Vista screen saver. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select the desired photos from the Organizer.
 
2. Choose File➪Export➪As New File(s). In the Export New Files dialog 
box that appears, choose JPEG as the file type.
 
3. Select your photo size and choose a quality setting.
 
 We recommend using a size that matches the resolution setting you’re 
using for your monitor. Use a quality setting of 12 for maximum quality.
 
4. Click the Browse button.
 
5. Click the Make New Folder button, save the photos as JPEGs to that 
folder, and name the folder something appropriate, such as Screen 
Saver. Click OK.
 
6. Choose whether to use the Original Names of your files or a Common 
Base Name, such as screen 1, screen 2, and so on.
 
7. Click Export.
 
 If all goes well, Elements informs you that it has executed the command.
 
8. Click OK.
 
9. In Windows Vista, choose Start➪Control Panel.
 
10. Click Appearance and Personalization in the Control Panel window. 
Under Personalization, click Change Screen saver.
 
11. In the Screen Saver Settings window, choose Photos from the Screen 
Saver drop-down list. Click Settings.
 
12. In the Photos Screen Saver Settings window, select Use Pictures and 
Videos. Click Browse and navigate to the folder containing your 
desired images.
 
13. Click OK and Save.
 
14. Specify your other options, such as wait time, power settings, and 
so on.
  
15. Click Apply and then OK to close the window. Close the Control Panel 
window as well.

Flyers, Ads, and Online Auctions
Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. Whether you’re 
selling puppies or advertising an open house, adding a photo to an ad or flyer 
really helps to drive home your message.
Here are the abbreviated steps to quickly create an ad or flyer:
 
1. In the Editor, in Full Edit mode, choose File➪New➪Blank File.
 
2. In the New dialog box, enter your desired document specifications 
and then click OK.
 
 Note that you can choose a preset size, such as U.S. Paper, from the 
Preset drop-down menu.
 
 We recommend entering the final dimensions and resolution for your 
desired output. If you want to print your ad or flyer on your desktop 
printer or at a service bureau, a good guideline for resolution is 300 
pixels per inch (ppi). For more on resolution and sizing images, be 
sure to check out Chapter 3. Leave the color mode as RGB and the 
Background Contents as White.
 
 If you want to fill your background with color, as we did in Figure 18-1, 
choose Edit➪Fill Layer and 
choose Color from the Contents 
pop-up menu. Choose your 
desired color in the Color Picker 
and then click OK.
 
3. Open your photos and then 
drag and drop them onto your 
new canvas with the Move 
tool. Make sure to choose 
Window➪Images➪Cascade to 
view all your canvases at the 
same time.
 
 Your image is automatically put 
on a separate layer. For more 
on layers, see Chapter 8. If you 
want to use only a portion of the 
image, as we did with the puppy 
in Figure 18-1, use your favor-
ite selection method to pluck 
out your element. For more on 
selections, see Chapter 7.
 
4. Select the Type tool, click the 
canvas, add your desired text, 
and then position your type 
with the Move tool.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
 Note that your type will also reside on its own layer.
 
5. When you’re done, choose File➪Save.
 
6. Name your file and choose Photoshop (.PSD) from the Format drop-
down menu and make sure that the Layers and Color check boxes are 
selected.
 
 If you want to take your document to a service bureau or copy shop, 
such as FedEx Kinko’s, you should save your document as a Photoshop 
PDF (.pdf) file. That way, you don’t have to worry about fonts, compat-
ibility issues, or printing snafus.
 
7. If you want to save a copy of your ad or flyer in the Organizer, check 
the Include in Organizer option. In addition, select Layers, ICC Profile 
and Use Lower Case Extension options and click Save.
 
If you’re preparing photos for online auction sites, such as eBay or Yahoo! 
Auctions, be sure to keep your images at a low resolution — 72 ppi, to be 
exact — and at 100 percent scale. Save the file as a JPEG to ensure that your 
file stays lean and mean while preserving colors. Be sure to check the image 
specifications posted on your online auction site.
Clothes, Hats, and More
Many local copy shops, retail stores, and Web sites (such as Zazzle.com or 
Cafepress.com) enable you to add photos to T-shirts, hats, buttons, tote bags, 
ties, mouse pads, and many other items. If you can produce it, they can put a 
photo on it. But it’s easy, and less expensive, to tackle this project yourself.
Buy plain white T-shirts at your local discount store or plain aprons and tote 
bags at your craft or fabric store. Then, buy special transfer paper at your 
office supply or computer store. Print your photos on the transfer paper (be 
sure to flip the images horizontally first) and iron the print onto the fabric, 
and you’ve got yourself a personalized gift for very little cash.
What do you get for the person who has everything? How about a blanket of 
memories? You can transfer photos onto patches of fabric and create unique 
memory quilts. What grandmother wouldn’t love to have a quilt with photos 
of her children and grandchildren?
Posters
For special events, important announcements, or maybe just your favorite 
family photos, you can get posters and large-size prints at many copy shops 
and service bureaus. Call and talk to a knowledgeable rep at your copy shop 
or service bureau so that you know exactly how to prepare your file. Here are 
a few questions to ask:

371
 Chapter 18: Ten More Project Ideas
 
✓ What file format and resolution should the file be?
 
✓ What print sizes do you offer?
 
✓ Do you provide mounting and lamination services? In addition to print-
ing large prints, many service bureaus mount prints on foam core or the 
sturdier gator board. These service bureaus also can laminate prints to 
protect them from scratches and UV rays.
Household and Business Inventories
Don’t wait for a natural disaster or theft to get you motivated to prepare an 
inventory of your household or business assets. Take your digital camera and 
shoot pictures of your items. Double-click your selected image and add text 
to describe the items in the caption section of the Organizer. You can also 
select the image and choose Edit➪Add Caption. Be sure to include makes, 
models, purchase dates, and dollar values of each piece. 
Then create a single PDF document from those multiple files by creating 
a slide show (see Figure 18-2). Click the Create button in the top right of 
the Application window. Click the Slide Show 
button in the Create panel. Set your Slide Show 
Preferences and click OK. In the Slide Show 
Editor dialog box that appears, select Output. 
In the Slide Show Output dialog box that opens, 
select Save as File (on the far left) and select PDF 
File. Select your Slide Size (we recommend the 
largest size for inventories) and click OK. In the 
Save Slide Show as PDF dialog box that appears, 
name the file, navigate to your desired location, 
and click Save. 
After the PDF is finished, you can upload the PDF 
file to a Web storage site, or burn a CD or DVD 
and place it off-site in a safety deposit box or 
other secure location. If the need arises, your insurance agent can view the 
PDF by using the free Adobe Reader software. For more on outputting to slide 
shows and writing to CD and DVD, see Chapter 15.
Project Documentation
Nothing helps to document a process like images. The spoken word and 
the written word are great, but showing how something comes together is 
even more effective. Consider using your photographs to help document 
your projects from beginning to end. Whether it’s a project involving home 
improvement, furniture building, crafts, or cooking, take photos at each stage 
PhotoSpin
Figure 18-2: Create an inventory 
of your assets.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
to record the project. If you’re taking 
a class or workshop and the instruc-
tors don’t mind, take your camera to 
class. Documenting the positions or 
steps of that new yoga, pottery, or 
gardening class can help you prac-
tice or re-create it on your own later, 
either for yourself or to explain to 
someone else.
Import your desired photos into the 
Organizer and create notes on each 
step of the project in the caption 
area. You can also create your text 
on the image itself by using the Type 
tool in the Editor. Output the images 
to a PDF (described in the preceding section), as shown in Figure 18-3.
 
Not into killing trees? Not to worry. You don’t have to print every project you 
make. Any file you create can be left as a purely digital file and e-mailed to 
other users. For details on sharing files, see Chapter 16.
School Reports and Projects
There’s nothing like some interesting photos to jazz up the obligatory school 
report. Doing a botany report? Include some close-ups of a flower with text 
labels on the parts of the flower. Have to write a paper on the habits of the 
lemurs of Madagascar? Trek down to your local zoo and have a photo shoot. 
Create a simple collage of lemurs eating, sleeping, and doing the other things 
that lemurs do. You can use the Photo Collage command in the Create panel 
(see details about this command in Chapter 16). Or you can create your own 
custom collage by making selections in the Editor (see more in Chapter 7) 
and dragging and dropping them onto a blank canvas. In fact, buying your 
children their own inexpensive point-and-shoot cameras may give them a 
little more enthusiasm for school work.
Wait — There’s More
Before you start taking your photos to the next dimension, here are a few 
extra ideas: Make fun place cards for dinner party guests, create your own 
business cards if you need only a few, design your own gift wrap and tags, or 
label storage boxes with photos of their contents. The possibilities are endless.
