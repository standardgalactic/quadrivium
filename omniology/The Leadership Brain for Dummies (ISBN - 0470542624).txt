I would like to dedicate this book to the memory of my father, Lee Broms, 
who was the first to model true leadership to me. I miss you, Dad.
Author’s Acknowledgments
When I first started doing trainings and presentations in this area 17 years 
ago, there were many skeptics. But the wealth of knowledge about the brain 
keeps growing, and more people are interested as they want to live longer 
and more productive lives. 
I want to thank the many neuroscientists who work to help us understand the 
brain, and the translators who help all of us understand the research and its 
applications. 
I want to thank the people at Wiley for making this project a reality. First, I wish 
to thank Mike Baker for believing in this idea and getting it off the ground. 
Traci Cumbay had the monumental job of being my project and copy editor. 
You are blessed with patience and kindness, Traci. My technical editor, Dr. 
Robert Sylwester, has always been a wonderful friend and mentor. Thanks, 
Bob, for your kind assistance. I want to thank the publicity and marketing 
people who will help make this book a success.
I also want to thank my dear friend, Mary Jane Sterling, author of many For 
Dummies books. She saw my work fitting in the For Dummies format. Now we 
can be Dummies together!
I wouldn’t be doing any of this if my mother, Mollie Broms, hadn’t been the 
businesswoman that she was. She raised a family, ran a business, and vol­
unteered her precious time. She has been an inspiration. I want to thank my 
husband, Scott, a man who lives to make me and his customers happy. A 
wonderful leader, Scott read every word and offered his wisdom. I also want 
to thank my children for their patience as I shortened vacations and gave up 
opportunities to be with my grandchildren in order to meet my deadlines. To 
my son, Josh, his wife, Amy, my daughter, Marnie, and her husband, Thabu, I 
look forward to watching your families grow as well as your business careers. 
I will make up any time I missed being with you, Jack and Emmie.

Introduction
B
ecoming a leader can take a lifetime, or just as long as it takes you to 
read this book. The Leadership Brain For Dummies is designed to equip 
you with everything you need to become the leader you want to be.
Although you can find many books on leadership and many books on the 
brain, no book has connected the subjects like this one. Neuroscience offers 
you an opportunity to maximize your brain and the brains of those you 
depend on to shape your future. 
In this book you get the how and the why. You find out how to be a great 
leader, great listener, great decision-maker, and great at handling yourself 
and others. But that information is only part of the picture. Understanding 
why you should do these things by using specific strategies that are compat­
ible with how the brain works is the rest of the story. Knowing why makes 
you more likely to use these strategies again and again.
Although business fads come and go, the brain is here to stay. Apply the best 
from neuroscience to your organization to create a climate and a culture in 
which everyone is happy — you, your employees, and your customers or 
clients.
About This Book
Leadership is an art and a science. This book shows you where the two meet 
and complement each other. It’s meant to engage your brain without taxing 
it. I want you to think about who you work for and who you work with to 
consider what you may do to make your experience and theirs a better one. 
With that purpose in mind, I have put together lists, stories, and tips to help 
you lead your own brain as well as the brains of others. The book you hold 
in your hands is not typical, and it’s certainly not a textbook. You can jump 
around however you like, not worrying that you’ve missed critical informa­
tion from an earlier chapter. I define new terms wherever they show up or 
direct you to their definitions so that you’re never at a loss for information. If 
an example or explanation from a previous chapter may support your under­
standing of a topic, I let you know how to find it.
This book is designed to be personalized by you — read it as questions arise 
or leadership challenges present themselves to you. Turn to any topic that 
interests you at any time that you want to find out about it. I’ve worked hard 
to make sure that you are always be at home within these pages. 

2
The Leadership Brain For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
I use the following conventions throughout the text to make things consistent 
and easy to understand:
	
✓	All Web addresses appear in monofont.
	
✓	New terms appear in italic and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
	
✓	Bold highlights the action parts of numbered steps and key words in 
bullet lists. 
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, no extra characters like hyphens 
indicate the break. So, when using one of these Web addresses, just type in 
exactly what you see in this book, as though the line break doesn’t exist.
The brain is a funny thing, and leadership should be fun. For these reasons, I 
have added humor where I think it is appropriate. Leaders should add humor 
to their leadership style because the brain responds to humor and it actually 
allows the brain to use some of its higher levels in order to “get the joke.”
Foolish Assumptions
The brain makes many assumptions. Mine is no different. I assume that you 
have picked up this book for one of two reasons: like me, you’re enthralled 
with research on the brain and want to know how it relates to everything, 
or you’re intently looking for new information about leadership — a fresh 
approach that motivates and inspires you. Either way, I assume that you will 
find information and strategies that you can apply right away.
I also assume that you would like to know what’s going on inside the heads of 
other people in your life — at work and at home. Finally, you’re a little wor­
ried about your own brain, and you want to know what to do to keep your 
business brain in business! 
What You’re Not to Read
The beauty of The Leadership Brain For Dummies is that you don’t have to 
read the whole book to come away with quite a bit of easily applicable infor­
mation. You can skip the shaded boxes of text called sidebars, which contain 

3
 Introduction
stories or examples that relate to information in the chapter. Sidebars help 
you connect more with some of the ideas in the chapter, but they don’t con­
tain new ideas and so are skippable. 
How This Book Is Organized
The Leadership Brain For Dummies is organized into five parts. The following 
sections give you a description of each part.
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head
Part I links leadership and the brain by giving you an overall feel for the con­
nections between the way the brain runs and the way your organization runs. 
It covers some brain basics, such as how the brain makes connections and 
changes, how it’s structured, and what it needs to learn and be productive. 
The fact that leaders are made and not born is a tribute to the brain’s ability 
to learn and change. 
This part also describes a great leader who uses knowledge about the brain 
to share a vision and mission, and to motivate others. And it describes a not-
so-good leader. Although negativity is not the point here, the brain needs 
examples to avoid as much as those to emulate, and so I give you both.
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader
Part II shows you how to develop leadership traits. Discovering your intel­
ligence strengths through self-knowledge and a written assessment helps 
you determine the style of leadership that feels right and put employees into 
the right positions. You find out about emotional intelligence and becoming 
an emotionally intelligent leader. As you assess yourself in relationship to 
your self-awareness, social awareness, and handling relationships, you see 
the importance of empathizing with your employees and all of your organiza­
tion’s stakeholders.
Additionally, you find out how the brain makes decisions in this part of the 
book. Can you think your way to the top? Good decision-making skills com­
bine both cognitive and emotional intelligences.

The Leadership Brain For Dummies 
Part III: Working with the 
Brains You Have
Rather than shaking up an organization by firing employees, a leader is better 
off first taking a close look at the current staff. Retraining often is a better 
option than rehiring, and this part of the books shows you how to find and 
foster the skills employees have to offer.
Understanding some major differences between the sexes and among differ­
ent generations helps you get employees into the positions where they’re 
most likely to thrive and offer them the most optimal working conditions to 
ensure that they do.
This part of the book also deals with the importance of teams, filling you in 
on how they develop and how they grow. Creating goals that appeal to the 
whole brain makes a difference in how your teams approach those goals and 
whether they reach them.
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains
In this part, I examine the importance of training and the consequences of 
not training, and I give you brain-compatible training techniques to increase 
learning and memory.
I explain what the brain needs to be ready to learn and ready to work, and I 
show you how to make your training dollars count by ensuring that the infor­
mation sticks in employees’ brains.
Finally, I show you how to conduct meetings that make a difference. 
Communicating with a diverse workforce means differentiating some of your 
meeting and communication strategies.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This section is part of the rich format of every For Dummies book. In it you 
find chapters devoted to quick bits of advice on the brain and leadership. 
First, I dispel some of the more common myths about the brain. I then offer 
you ten tips on leading with the brain in mind. Finally, I show you ten ways to 
develop your brain for leadership and living a better life.

 Introduction
Icons Used in This Book
Every For Dummies book uses icons — those little pictures in the margins 
that catch your eye as you peruse the book. Here’s what they are and what 
they mean:
	
This icon flags bits of information that deserves a second look, making it 
easier for you to return to again and again.
	
Although you’re likely to find the detailed technical information you find next 
to this icon interesting, you don’t need it to understand the main points of the 
book. 
	
Whenever I give you information that will save you time or money or make 
your job easier, I flag it with this icon.
	
Stop and read information that appears next to this daunting icon to avoid 
leadership pitfalls and mistakes.
Where to Go from Here
Pick a chapter, any chapter. Each one is its own little book. You won’t need to 
go back to fill in missing pieces from earlier chapters. Looking for information 
about how to make a team function smoothly? Go straight to Chapter 14. Want 
new ways to make your meetings more interesting and effective? Chapter 20 
has what you need. And if you’re an overachiever or just insatiably curious, by 
all means turn the page and keep going until you get to the back cover.
The best leaders never stop wondering, reading, and seeking answers. You 
are obviously one of them! I’m grateful for the opportunity to help you on 
your quest.

Part I
Leadership Is All 
in Your Head

In this part . . .
H
ere, I show you some basics of the brain, including 
how the brain’s structure and function is similar to 
the structure and function of your business. Your brain 
has a CEO that makes decisions, plans for the future, and 
celebrates success. I tell you about what the brain needs 
to be at its best, as well as methods for making sure 
you’re leading your best.

Chapter 1

Leadership Principles
In This Chapter
▶	Looking into leadership
▶	Connecting neuroscience and leadership
▶	Building teams with the brain in mind
▶	Training effectively for any brain
I
n this book you find out how your brain works and how to work it to 
improve your decision-making, training, and hiring so that you create a 
workplace where people are happy and productive.
In order to survive and thrive through humans’ long history, the brain had to 
be social. Humans needed people around them to help them conquer whatever 
dangers they might face. Today’s world looks a lot different from that of even a 
century ago, but you still need people to help you prosper. Being social means 
establishing relationships. Relationships often require leadership.
The leadership brain learns how to be self-aware and self-confident. This brain 
knows how to persuade and convince others that her idea is the best. At the 
same time, the leader takes others’ feelings and ideas into consideration.
The good news from neuroscience is that you can learn how to be a leader. 
This book shows you how. 
The Leadership Brain For Dummies helps you become the leader you want to be.
Defining Leadership
Leadership is the ability to bring like-minded people together to get remark­
able things done. Because humans are a social species and natural hierarchies 
develop, the concept of leadership emerged. Someone has to be in charge, 
share a vision, and lead others toward the goals.

10
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
	
Leadership depends on relationship-building. A leader can lead only through 
her ability to build relationships between and among employees, customers, 
investors, and any other stakeholders.
Knowing and amending your 
leadership style
Different approaches to leadership give you the opportunity to be the leader 
you want to be when you want to be it. You can find your leadership style by 
reading Chapter 6. The style you naturally use or the one you cultivate may 
change according to circumstances, which is as it should be. When you need 
to take charge because you’re dealing with new employees who need more 
guidance, you might adopt the authoritarian style. But perhaps in your heart 
you really favor group decision-making; you can then use that style in other 
situations, when it’s a better fit.
As a leader, you are many different things to different people. You have a lot 
of hats to wear, but there’s only one brain under those hats, and you get to 
know it better in Chapter 5, which shows you how leadership and the brain 
interact.
Providing feedback
As you find out in Chapter 4, feedback is food for thought. Feed the brains of 
your employees by providing the necessary information to keep them on task 
and keep your vision in sight. Without feedback, people lose self-confidence 
and motivation.
Feedback begins with the senior leadership team, but it goes much beyond 
that. Rather than relying on a trickle-down effect, leaders must provide feed­
back to each and every person in the organization. You find suggestions in 
Chapter 20 to communicate with employees throughout your organization.
Developing high emotional intelligence
Your ability to have good relationships with others gets you farther in busi­
ness and in your personal life than your IQ. It’s not how smart you are that 
counts, but rather how you are smart.

11
 Chapter 1: Connecting Brain Science to Leadership Principles
Leaders use their emotional intelligence to handle relationships. When lead­
ers are aware of what they feel and how their feelings affect the work environ­
ment, they can choose to handle those emotions in such a way that they use 
their intuition but don’t become overwhelmed by emotion. Emotional intelli­
gence includes the ability to understand and work with what another person 
is feeling. For instance, the possibility of lay-offs looms in your organization. 
How are your people feeling? Stress levels must be high. As their leader, you 
have to let employees know how much you value their contributions, exactly 
how things stand, and what your decision-making process relies on.
	
Real power is the ability to control your own brain. You need to understand 
how the brain works, how powerful your emotions are, and how you can use 
your self-awareness to prevent reflexive actions.
Chapter 8 highlights the importance of self-awareness, self-management, 
social awareness, and social management.
Ensuring a safe working environment
One of the basic responsibilities of a leader is providing a safe and appealing 
work environment. Employees face stressors in their lives every day; reliev­
ing them of the stress that an unsafe environment may cause is imperative to 
having happy, productive employees.
Safety in the workplace includes both physical safety and emotional well-
being. After you have the safety factor covered, making the work environ­
ment fun as well as inspirational invites cooperation. Caring enough to 
provide an attractive, safe working environment and put the needs of your 
staff ahead of your own needs is a key leadership quality.
Chapter 12 tells you how to create a safe and appealing work environment.
Communicating effectively
Effective communication is a hallmark of a great leader. You need to share 
your vision with passion and commitment. Creating a picture for all to see 
requires you to make your message simple enough for all to grasp and 
complex enough to make it interesting. When you paint your picture and 
employees or customers see it, their brains connect this vision to their own 
previously stored networks of information to reinforce your words.

12
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
But communication doesn’t happen in just one direction. Listening to the 
needs, desires, and dreams of your employees is essential. And you listen 
and make connections between their statements and your dream.
Chapter 4 emphasizes good communication skills.
Making decisions with heart and head
Decision-making is based on prior experiences. Your brain asks, “What 
worked in the past?” or “In what similar situations was a decision made that 
was good? Or bad?”
Your emotions are very much involved in the decision-making process. The 
neurotransmitter dopamine is very active in your reward system. The dopa­
mine neurons remember whether an experience or a decision made you feel 
good. Those chemical memories help you make every decision. If you made a 
bad decision, your amygdala, the raw emotional center in the brain that I dis­
cuss in Chapters 2 and 8, reacts immediately to the situation.
	
Good leaders make decisions based on what their emotions tell them as well 
as on the facts. The right hemisphere of your brain explores the challenges 
and possibilities in a novel situation in which you must make a decision. But 
your logical left hemisphere recalls routines and previously established pro­
cesses that have worked in the past. Decision-making is a whole-brain activ­
ity. Good decision-making always takes into account both cognitive skills and 
emotional intelligence.
Chapter 9 discusses the art and science of decision-making.
Leadership on the Brain
Emerging science connects the brain to leadership: Promising leaders can 
access different levels of the brain in a conscious way in order to share 
their vision and achieve their goals. Understanding how the brain functions 
enables you not only to work within the bounds of your own brain but also 
understand and work with, rather than against, the brains of others. Leading 
in a brain-compatible manner helps you accomplish your goals much faster.
Balancing novelty and predictability
Both predictability and novelty make the brain happy. Knowing what is going 
to happen next lowers stress in the brain, but too much predictability leads 
to boredom. In Chapter 3, I show you how creating an environment that 

13
 Chapter 1: Connecting Brain Science to Leadership Principles
contains enough predictability makes it easier for the brain to concentrate on 
such areas as creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making.
Because the brain remembers patterns and seeks patterns to make sense of 
its world, familiarity breeds security. If your teams are in an environment in 
which it is okay, actually encouraged, to ask “dumb” questions or make mis­
takes, then their brains can run wild with ideas. Some research suggests that 
solving problems in a more creative way may lead to better solutions, and 
so an atmosphere in which the brain can relax and wander may lead to more 
innovations.
Grasping the chemical element
If you want to understand human nature, you need to know something about 
neurotransmitters, the chemicals in your brain. For instance, serotonin has 
long been known as a neurotransmitter related to emotion. If your serotonin 
levels are low, you’re more likely to become angry or aggressive. What’s 
more, you’re less likely to be able to control your reactions. 
	
Because serotonin is produced by the food you eat, eating right — and espe­
cially eating breakfast — helps you control emotional responses. 
Your chemical levels can also be affected by social behavior, culture, and 
genetics. In Chapter 2, I share information about the functions of some of the 
chemicals in your brain, as well as ways to make the most of them.
Sculpting brains — yours and theirs
That three-pound lump of tissue in your skull is flexible and vulnerable. This 
is good news and one of the most promising research findings in neurosci­
ence. This flexibility enables the brain to recover from some traumas and 
break old habits. It also means you can change your brain. 
Chapter 4 shows you how to train your brain and explains that the brains of 
your current and future employees are indeed very trainable. You have to 
appreciate the fact that you can teach an old dog new tricks!
In Chapter 19, you discover the differences between training new employees 
and those who have been with you for awhile. Both brains respond to train­
ing, but they do so in different ways. Finding out how to address those differ­
ences goes a long way toward making training stick.

14
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Different strokes for different brains
Move over IQ, new intelligences are in town, and their number keeps growing. 
In Chapter 7, I share information about nine different ways of being smart. If 
you have a brain, you have some of each of these kinds of intelligence:
	
✓	Verbal/linguistic
	
✓	Mathematical/logical
	
✓	Musical/rhythmic
	
✓	Visual/spatial
	
✓	Bodily kinesthetic
	
✓	Naturalist
	
✓	Interpersonal 
	
✓	Intrapersonal
	
✓	Philosophical/moral/ethical 
Do you want the leader’s brain?
People often confuse the roles of leader and 
manager. After you understand the brain, 
you will see that there are cognitive skill dif­
ferences between the two. If you look at the 
function of the left hemisphere as described in 
Chapter 2, you see that one of its responsibili­
ties is to handle routine procedures that have 
been previously established. This is the role of 
the manager. The manager manages what has 
previously been set up.
The leader, on the other hand, delegates the 
established processes to managers. New chal­
lenges, new problems, and unidentified situa­
tions are handled by the right hemisphere of the 
brain. The leader and the leadership team deal 
with these novel situations and create proce­
dures to handle them. 
A manager can be a leader, of course, and a 
leader may also be a manager. But in talking 
about the brain, the leadership role is much like 
the right hemisphere’s role, and the manager’s 
role is akin to the left hemisphere’s role. To run 
efficiently both the productive brain and the 
productive organization utilize both roles.
If you develop a leadership brain, you learn to 
recognize situations using your sensory sys­
tems and your emotions. Then you use your 
brain’s CEO, the prefrontal cortex, along with 
your gut feelings to respond. If the situation 
is novel, your right hemisphere, and the right 
hemispheres of your leadership team, use their 
creative, holistic, spatial approach to create 
the response. In familiar situations, your left 
hemisphere relies on previously established 
processes.
You can develop yourself into the kind of leader 
you want to be.

15
 Chapter 1: Connecting Brain Science to Leadership Principles
I find that leaders and employees alike enjoy finding out more about them­
selves. And so Chapter 7 not only offers you a definition and examples of these 
intelligences, it provides an assessment for you. Knowing your strengths and 
weaknesses and helping your followers learn theirs is part of good leadership. 
This information may help you understand why you like something and why 
you’re uncomfortable with some people, tasks, and environments.
Using Brain Science to Build Your Team
Information on the brain suggests ways you can change the brains of those 
you train. The person others consider the best may not be the best choice 
for your particular situation. Knowledge and skills are important, but employ­
ees also need to know how to build and maintain those relationships that 
keep your company thriving.
	
When you need to add to your team, former General Electric CEO Jack Welch 
recommends that you look at the best employees you have and find people 
just like them. 
As a leader, you are called on to make hiring decisions that affect the entire 
organization. Whether you promote current employees or hire new ones, 
understanding how the brain functions helps you make those decisions.
Understanding male and female brains 
Definite variations exist in male and female brains. The brain is highly influ­
enced by its experiences; therefore, some of the characteristics you see in 
males or females may be from environmental influences or in combination 
with the brain differences. 
Chapter 13 helps you address the common differences between male and 
female brains. For example, knowing that females tend to prefer eye contact 
while males may not can affect the way you share your vision and the values 
of your company.
Women can read maps and men do ask for directions. But there are some dif­
ferences that may affect how they perform at work — not how well they per­
form, but rather how they do things differently.

16
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Bridging the generation gap
Several generations often are at work in one organization. Becoming familiar 
with the work ethic, needs, and expectations of each of these generations can 
make the climate of your workplace less stressful for all.
As a leader involved in business in this technological world, you must catch 
up and keep up with the challenges of working with several generations. Your 
organization can be part of a global economy and become more successful 
with the assistance of the younger generations and the loyalty and values of 
the older generations. Find out in Chapter 15 how to take advantage of the 
characteristics of all employees.
Goal setting and goal getting
Whether rewards are tangible (like bonuses) or intangible (good feelings of 
accomplishment), goals help the brain focus. Part of the leader’s job is to 
keep people centered on the mission of the organization. As your teams go 
through developmental stages from infancy to wisdom, their goals keep them 
on track. Chapter 14 shows you how to create goals that intrigue the right 
hemisphere and the left hemisphere of the brain.
	
Celebrate each accomplishment! Every step along the way to reaching a goal 
is cause for celebration. As a leader, you must shift your focus from your suc­
cess to the successes of your employees. 
Training with the Brain in Mind
One of the goals of most organizations is to have a staff of highly trained 
employees. Brain science has effectively shown that the way information is 
presented, rehearsed, and reviewed influences the effectiveness of that train­
ing. For instance, using emotion in training helps trainees store information 
more effectively.
CEOs cringe at the thought of having employees away from the job for one 
to three weeks for training. They soon realize, however, that good training is 
worth it. The results of training include
	
✓	Brains that see the big picture.
	
✓	Brains that have changed to use a new process or product.

17
 Chapter 1: Connecting Brain Science to Leadership Principles
	
✓	Brains that can see and share your vision.
	
✓	Brains that can work together as training creates relationships.
	
✓	Brains that can see beyond their own jobs.
In Chapter 16, I talk about mental maps — pictures of how people see the 
world and how things should work. Training provides the opportunity to 
change the mental maps of your employees so that they more closely match 
your own vision.
Supporting trainees’ bodies and brains
As a former educator I can tell you that I would have loved nothing more 
than to have a classroom full of students who were ready to learn. Their par­
ents thought they were ready, and most of the students thought they were 
ready. But they weren’t ready because their bodies and their brains weren’t 
fit enough to learn. It takes proper nutrition, the right amount of sleep, and 
regular exercise to truly make the brain ready for learning or training.
In Chapter 17, I share information about how proper nutrition affects the 
brains of your trainees as well as your employees and yourself. The amount 
of sleep your people get each night has an impact on what and how much 
they remember from the previous day’s training. And exercise is key to get­
ting blood and oxygen to the brain for optimal work.
You can take steps to make your trainings more productive. Lowering your 
trainees’ stress levels through proper nutrition, rest, and exercise is a begin­
ning. Get the most out of your training dollars by ensuring that your people 
are fit to be trained.
Making training stick
The most memorable and productive trainings are those that engage your 
brain. This engagement can be through emotional connections, humor, fun, 
or through personal connections to your life. 
If you can answer the following question for each of your employees and 
trainees, you can head them in the right direction: What’s in it for me? Both 
the CEOs of major corporations and every classroom teacher knows that if 
employees and students can see a connection to their lives, they will buy in 
to the learning.

18
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
	
Motivation comes from a desire or a need. See to it that your vision and your 
training goals fit into one of these two categories. 
In Chapter 18, I share with you ways to make trainings stick. The emotional 
component, the memory systems involved, and the climate of the training 
make a big difference in how much information employees retain. 
Training must also involve the support of both leaders and managers. 
Employees and new hires need to feel that they’re part of something bigger — 
that their contributions are appreciated and make a difference.

n the past 20 years, scientists have been able to look at the brain through 
specialized imaging technology. Looking at the brain in action is a far cry 
from the old way: looking at brains during autopsy, finding lesions, comparing 
the area of the lesion to the behavior of the patient, and making a diagnosis. The 
1990s were the Decade of the Brain, and the 21st century promises to be the 
Century of the Brain. Walk into any book store or up to a magazine stand during 
any month and you find cover articles about the brain. Curiosity about the brain 
peaked with the horror stories about Alzheimer’s disease, and the baby boomers 
want to know how to keep their brains young and in good shape.
Interest in the brain goes beyond worrying about memory. The wonderful 
applications of brain research have reached classrooms and boardrooms 
around the world. New words and new worlds are being adopted to help us 
use brain science, psychology, and cognitive science at home, in school, and 
in our global economy.
Brain functions and leadership functions are similar. Brains and leaders both 
need to know where they are, where they may go, whether they are going in 
the right direction, how to get there, and how to remember the experiences 
to apply them in the future.
Humans have brains to help them plan and move. Understanding the brain 
means understanding yourself, your loved ones, and the people with whom 
you work. As scientists continue to study the brain (and they have a very 
long way to go), you’ll get more information to apply to your life. But caution 
is key — this complex organ continually surprises researchers. The famous 
quote by Lyal Watson, the South African biologist who wrote Supernature, 
says, “If the brain were so simple we could understand it, we would be so 
simple we couldn’t.”

Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
In this chapter you find out about the structures of the brain, their functions, 
and the ways they work together.
Organization: The Business of Business 
and the Business of the Brain
As a leader, you have to take care of what goes on within your business and 
what goes on outside your business — that is, your employees and their 
work on the inside and your customer service, sales, and satisfaction on 
the outside. Your brain also has internal control centers as well as external 
controls. Just as you organize and coordinate what is happening inside and 
outside in order to make the best decisions and act on necessary problems 
and situations, your brain coordinates internal messages about what’s going 
on within your body as it monitors external information in order to respond 
in an appropriate way. Both leaders and brains must be experts at executing 
appropriate actions and reactions.
Starting at the bottom
Some neuroscientists talk about the brain’s organization from the top down, 
while others like to start at the bottom. The bottom of the brain consists of 
the brain stem and the cerebellum, along with a few smaller structures. The 
pons and the medulla run your body, keeping you breathing and your heart 
beating. For the most part, the bottom of the brain runs on an involuntary 
system. Like the inner workings of most companies, these processes are 
expected and go unnoticed unless something goes wrong.
Executive functions take place in the top layer of the brain, the cortex. There 
decisions are made, planning is completed and executed, and challenges are 
addressed. Like the orchestra leader, the top of your brain keeps all of the 
pieces playing together to create a masterpiece. Similarly, leaders, senior 
leadership teams, and employees work together to address the needs and 
desires of the organization.
Moving forward to make connections
The four lobes of the brain are arranged so that the sensory lobes are located 
in the back of the brain. As you look at the words on this page, the occipital 
lobe in the back of your brain takes in that information. Then those words 
are brought forward in the brain to the frontal lobes, where the information 
is defined and you determine the meaning of those words. Perhaps they are 

21
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
a call to action or you make a connection between those words and informa­
tion you have previously stored in memory. The temporal lobes hold onto 
the new information and link it with the old.
Left, right, left (hemispheres)
According to Elkhonon Goldberg, clinical professor of neurology at New York 
University School of Medicine, as new information enters the brain through 
the sensory lobes in the back and then is brought forward for thoughtful 
reflection, your brain decides which hemisphere is going to first process it. 
Familiarity and novelty come in to play now. If the information is novel, it is 
processed by the right hemisphere, which is organized to deal with novel 
challenges in order to come up with a creative response. When the informa­
tion is familiar — a challenge that the brain has responded to before and now 
has an established routine in which to deal with — the left hemisphere first 
processes it.
At some point, both hemispheres are involved in responding to incoming stim­
uli. Just as in the reading example above, information starts in one hemisphere 
and then is moved to the other. Both hemispheres contribute to cognitive pro­
cessing. In your organization, you have departments or teams for established 
routines, but when novel challenges arise, you probably have specialized 
teams or the senior leadership team to deal with the challenge first.
Separating the Mind from the Brain
Some people compare the brain to a computer. Although this is not a very 
accurate analogy, the correlations are helpful when talking about the mind 
and the brain. If the brain is the hardware, then the mind is the software.
Does the brain matter?
The brain is often described as your gray matter. Gray matter refers to the 
top layer of the brain. This layer isn’t actually gray but brownish-pink while 
it’s alive, but its name comes from preserved brains. Brains that have been 
preserved and sliced for research purposes look as though the tissue around 
the outside of the brain is gray, and the inner lining appears white.
Separating gray matter and white matter helps with some understanding 
of brain function. The gray matter consists of the neuron cell bodies in the 
brain, and the white matter is made up of the cells’ nerve fibers that are 
coated with a white fatty substance called myelin. Myelin assists in the trans­
mission of information in the brain.

22
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
The mind is what the brain does
Neuroscientist Susan Greenfield, theorizes that the mind may be the “person­
alization” of the brain. According to many researchers, the brain’s functions, 
such as feeling, thoughts, problem-solving, and communicating create the 
mind. But the mind also constructs the brain. The feelings, thoughts, experi­
ences, and memories that build that personal mind also change the structure 
and the function of the brain.
As you read this book, your brain is changing. Brain cells are organizing 
themselves to take in this information, consider the importance, and then 
decide whether to dispose of or keep the learning.
In this book, I refer to the organ of learning as the brain as many neurosci­
entists have chosen to do. Some call it the mind/brain, but I consider brain 
more active than mind. In making this decision, I created networks that 
automatically cause me to refer to the mind/brain as the brain without giving 
any thought to the decision. If I focus on changing that pattern in my brain, 
I would consciously have to try for several weeks before I fully adopted the 
change, but I would be able to change my brain . . . or change my mind, if I 
wanted to!
Discovering the Chemicals and 
Structures that Power Your Brain
You ask your team leader what new sales techniques were taught at the 
regional meeting. You have caught him a little off guard in the elevator 
without his notes. Watching closely, you see his brain working. His right 
hemisphere processes this novel challenge. He imagines himself back at 
the meeting. He pictures the room and the trainer. In his mind, he sees the 
trainer demonstrating the strategy. The left hemisphere takes over as he 
remembers the process. “Oh, yes!” he thinks to himself. He looks at you and 
begins to share what he learned. His brain was making connections. He found 
the information by tracing his steps and thinking about locations and events. 
The connections had been made at the meeting, and so by visualizing the 
meeting room, he found triggers to reconnect to those networks he had set 
up in his brain.

23
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
The upcoming sections explain how your brain makes connections and pro­
cesses information.
Neurons old and new
Brain structures are made up of cells that continually interconnect with other 
brain cells — even at night while you sleep. The brain learns by making con­
nections among brain cells. The brain cells attributed with learning are called 
neurons. You are born with about 100 billion neurons, and most of them stay 
with you throughout your life.
The brain also includes cells called glia, or glial cells. Glia actually means 
glue, and in some instances holding things together is what they do. Glia are 
sometimes called housekeepers or nurturing cells. Not long ago, glia were 
believed to have nothing to do with actual learning, but recent research sup­
ports that indeed glia may perform some important functions for making con­
nections and retrieving memories. Your brain has about ten times more glial 
cells than neurons.
Twenty years ago the widely held thought was that the brain produces no 
new neurons. Studies suggest that under certain conditions, the brain does 
produce more of these cells. Throughout our lives we lose neurons for a 
variety of reasons, and so replacing some of them seems to make sense. The 
process of creating new neurons is called neurogenesis. If you’re interested in 
stimulating this process in your brain, try learning something new, exercis­
ing, and avoiding stress.
	
Your brain works by communicating among neurons. Each neuron has 
three main parts: dendrites, the cell body, and an axon. (See Figure 2-1.) 
Communication happens like this:
	
1.	The axon in the sending neuron releases a chemical messenger to 
convey information.
	
2.	The sending neuron moves the chemical messenger through its den­
drites, and the amount of electricity within the cell body changes.
	
3.	Electricity travels down the axon.
	
	 Most axons are coated with a substance called myelin. Glial cells within 
myelin aid in transmission of messages.

24
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
	
4.	The electrical impulse forces chemicals called neurotransmitters out 
of the vesicle and through the end of the axon into a space called a 
synapse.
	
5.	Neurotransmitters swim in the synapse until they find a dendrite of 
another neuron to attach themselves to.
	
6.	The process begins again.

As you use your brain for learning, socializing, and generally taking in infor­
mation from different sources, your neurons change. Dendrites grow as you 
learn. When you are born some neurons have few or no dendrites. As your 
brain begins taking in information, dendrites grow. Your axons change, as 
well. As neurons are used, axon terminals begin to grow to send out more 
messages.
The visual system is one of the better understood systems in the brain. When 
a baby begins to see, the visual part of her brain stores the patterns she sees. 
Neurons connect to form a pattern like her mother’s face. The baby begins 
with a fuzzy outline, and as her vision continues to develop fine points such as 
eyebrows and nostrils are added until her brain stores the complete picture.

25
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
Neuroplasticity
Your thoughts can change your brain. That’s a pretty impressive statement, 
and worthy of explanation. Your thoughts and your actions can change the 
structure and function of your brain. Going back to the computer analogy, 
the brain is not as hard-wired as was once thought. The process of changing 
the brain is called neuroplasticity. Scientists shorten that by saying the brain 
is plastic. In response to the environment, neurons change their activity and 
reorganize pathways. Neuroplasticity occurs throughout the normal develop­
ment of the brain and for adaptive purposes when the brain tries to repair 
after an injury.
The brain’s plasticity enables you to learn and remember. Perhaps you 
decide to learn how to play bridge. You have played other card games 
before, and so your brain contains networks (neurons that have connected 
to each other) for basic card information: 52 cards in a deck, four different 
suits, two red, two black, and the numbering system for each. As you learn to 
play the new game, your brain connects the rules to your previously stored 
card networks. Learning the new game is therefore much easier for you than 
for someone who has never played cards before and has no card networks. 
As you continue to learn bridge, your card networks grow and your brain 
changes.
Better living through brain chemistry
Chemicals that the brain produces are called neurotransmitters. These are the 
messengers that go between the sending neuron and the receiving neuron. 
Neurons exchange neurotransmitters to communicate with each other. They 
do their job at the synapse by either causing a neuron to fire or prevent­
ing the firing. (Firing is the word given to the action of a neuron when it is 
activated to send a message to another neuron.) Some of the neurotransmit­
ters are excitatory — that is, they cause the neuron to fire when they attach 
themselves to the dendrites. Other neurotransmitters are inhibitory and keep 
New brain, new tricks?
At a presentation on the brain, a neuroscientist 
was explaining that the brain is the only organ 
that doesn’t replace all its cells. Our bodies 
replace other cells every few days or months. 
You get brand new skin, but your new skin looks 
like the old skin because of your genetic blue­
print. Your brain, however, does not replace 
cells at that rate. What would happen, the neu­
roscientist asked, if your brain did?
A reply came from the back of the room, “Well, 
I guess you could hide your own Easter eggs!”

26
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
the neuron from firing. A large number of different excitatory and inhibi­
tory neurotransmitters are in involved in the decision to fire or not to fire. If 
more excitatory than inhibitory neurotransmitters attach themselves to the 
neuron, the neuron fires and sends the message on.
When neurons fire together, they are said to wire together. The more often 
a message is sent through a network, the faster and stronger that wired net­
work becomes. If you go back to the bridge analogy, as you continue to take 
lessons and practice how to count the number of points in the hand you’re 
dealt, the stronger the network that is set up for counting points becomes. 
Think of any task or skill that you have learned. You started out slowly and 
tentatively, but as you learned and practiced you got better.
Dozens of neurotransmitters have been identified. For the purpose of this 
book, only a few are important. I tell you about them in Table 2-1.
Table 2-1:	
Common Neurotransmitters
Neurotransmitter
Function
Acetylcholine
Used to operate muscle movements; plays a critical role in 
memory
Dopamine
Released as part of the reward system in the brain as well 
as to control muscle movements; assists with focus
Endorphins
Brain and body’s natural painkiller; known to cause the 
“runner’s high”; laughing, social contacts, and music 
encourage the release of this chemical
Norepinephrine
Sometimes called noradrenaline; acts in our brains the 
way adrenaline acts in the body; affects moods; serves as 
major alert chemical for the stress response
Serotonin
Assists in transmission of messages; enhances mood; 
calms
Chemical messengers determine your moods, behavior, and what you 
remember. The foods that you eat, the activities in which you participate, 
your relationships, whether you love your job, your co-workers, and your life 
all determine the chemical balance of your brain. Yes, some genetics play a 
role in this as well. For instance, low levels of serotonin resulting in anxiety 
or depression may be related to some genetic factors. Some research sug­
gests that eating right and exercising can increase those levels and you may 
be one of the lucky depressives who can control your feelings without drugs. 
However, anti-depressants do save lives both literally and figuratively. Some 
people have difficulty maintaining a normal chemical balance. Only you and a 
professional can determine your needs.

 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
From rocky roads to superhighways
As networks of neurons are set up via their chemical messengers, they ini­
tially are slow and sometimes clumsy. An assembly line at any factory begins 
in the same fashion. Perhaps you remember the I Love Lucy episode in which 
Lucy and Ethel work at a candy factory. After the candy is chocolate-coated 
a conveyor belt brings the candy to Lucy and Ethel. They are to take each 
piece, wrap it in paper, and then place the wrapped candy back on the belt 
for the next destination, where it will be boxed for shipment.
Having total focused attention is a must for this type of work, and the Lucy 
character is anything but focused. She wraps the first few pieces of candy 
and thinks she is doing a great job. The manager sees that Lucy and Ethel are 
doing well and turns up the speed on the conveyor belt. Lucy desperately 
tries to wrap the candy but ends up eating the pieces, hiding them, and even 
putting them down her uniform to get rid of enough so that she can wrap a 
few to send on their way. Ethel performs the same ridiculous actions.
Lucy never developed the opportunity to set up a strong network in her 
brain for wrapping candy quickly. Her initial network was working but hadn’t 
had enough time to gain strength through repetition. Her candy-wrapping 
network was similar to a trail just being blazed to become a road. The path 
is overgrown and rocky, but eventually with enough traffic it begins to get 
smooth. As more and more people use the road, more lanes are necessary 
to keep up with the demand. Eventually such a busy road becomes a super­
highway. Our everyday habits and procedures began in this rock fashion but 
became smooth and speedy with repetition. They turn into superhighways 
where connections are made in milliseconds.
How the brain loves
Oxytocin is a hormone that acts as a neurotrans­
mitter in the brain. Along with the chemical pheny­
ethylamine, oxytocin and dopamine give you the 
feelings of excitement, passion, or euphoria when 
you’re falling in love, whether you’re experiencing a 
crush on someone you hope will become your sig­
nificant other or falling in love with your new baby.
You may have witnessed an office romance or 
attraction that affects your employees’ focus 
and concentration. Or perhaps one of your 
workers falls in love and you observe more of a 
desire to get work done and go spend time with 
this person. Sometimes love makes a worker 
better at the job and easier to get along with. 
Happiness can have that affect. If the romance 
matures, less of the “love chemicals” are 
released, but the good feeling remains. If the 
relationship ends suddenly, and your employee 
gets dumped, the feelings of despair cause a 
sudden depletion in the love chemicals and 
may cause a problem in the office. You may 
want to give the employee some time to regain 
a chemical balance. As a leader, knowing how 
the chemical system works in such situations 
may help you be more understanding of both 
types of situations.

28
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
The result would have been different for Lucy and Ethel if the leadership in 
the candy factory had trained its employees properly. Training creates the 
correct connections and provides practice so that employees know how to 
respond.
Use it or lose it
Blooming and pruning refer to the processes that go on in the brain in which 
neurons develop new connections while losing others.
This organ, which keeps us alive by regulating our heartbeat and respira­
tory system, is constantly active. Connections are being made even while we 
sleep. Neurons are firing all of the time, albeit more slowly some of the time.
Imagine that a baby’s brain has formed a pattern for recognizing the baby’s 
mother. And then the baby’s mother is not around for a long period of time. 
The network that was set up in the baby’s visual system would not be acti­
vated, and that pattern would slowly fade. The neurons used for that pattern 
may be recruited to be used for another pattern, and slowly the mother’s 
face pattern would be disassembled. The dendrites would be pruned away. 
The synapses disappear, and the baby would no longer recognize Mommy.
Starting the day
You awaken at 6 a.m. to the sound of your 
alarm clock. Norepinephrine is released in your 
brain to make you get up and go. You jump out 
of bed and dress for your morning run. Before 
you leave, you grab a protein bar because you 
know your brain does not store energy and you 
want to run on more than just fumes. You fill 
your water bottle so you can keep your brain 
and body hydrated, and you step outside. The 
day is warm and wonderful, and as you breathe 
in deeply dopamine is released in your brain as 
you look forward to some great exercise. As 
you run, endorphins are slowly released in your 
brain. You begin to experience the “runner’s 
high” as your somewhat stressed body begins 
to feel no pain. You finish your run at about 7:10 
a.m. feeling good because the exercise also 
caused more dopamine to be released, not 
only in your reward pathway but also in your 
frontal lobe. This release helps you keep better 
focus throughout the day. After a shower, you 
dress for work and as you admire yourself in 
the mirror and feel good about your accom­
plishment, your brain releases serotonin. After 
eating a breakfast of fruit, yogurt, and steel-cut 
oatmeal, you head to the office satisfied with 
your accomplishments thus far and looking for­
ward to a productive day.

29
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
As your brain ages, areas that aren’t in use begin to atrophy, in other words, 
waste away. This is particularly true in those who have not kept their brains 
active. Atrophy also tends to happen earlier for males. For this reason new 
learning is very important to continue to keep your brain active throughout 
your life. The more connections you have, the more you can lose before 
symptoms of dementia or Alzheimer’s manifest themselves. In other words, 
the more paths you have to a destination, the more options you have when 
there are detours.
Brain science tells us that we can design our own brains. The fact that the 
choices you make affect your brain’s structure and function puts a great 
deal of responsibility on you. (However, you can’t control everything, and 
certainly not cognitive problems arising from stroke or disease.) Not only 
are you responsible for your own brain, but you may also be responsible for 
the brains of others. Are you providing stimulation for your employees? You 
want them to have good brains. Productivity and success hinge on the brains 
in your organization being at their optimal levels.
Three Brains in One: How Your Brain 
Combines its Tasks
Imagine a fragile gelatinous mass of tissue filled with brain cells, blood, 
oxygen, and nutrients determining your future. This collection of brain 
matter, which makes you who you are, can be divided into three parts with 
separate structures and functions that together comprise one brain.
Keeping your brain forever young
Dr. David Snowdon of the University of Kentucky 
discovered an order of nuns living in Mankato, 
Minnesota, who lived to a very ripe old age. 
Many were in their nineties or older when they 
died. Snowdon autopsied the nuns’ brains and 
discovered a lot about the brain from this work.
For example, one of the nuns who died was 
in her late nineties. She watched television 
shows like Jeopardy! and answered a lot of 
the questions. She gardened and interacted 
with the other nuns and seemed quite happy, 
and although she had a few memory lapses, 
seemed to be really “with it.”
Snowdon was amazed when he had the oppor­
tunity to look at her brain. It was riddled with 
Alzheimer’s and literally fell apart when he 
began his work on it. Judging from her behav­
ior, no one would have ever guessed that she 
had this disease. It appeared that aging well 
was associated with living a healthy lifestyle 
and keeping the brain active. Snowdon’s study 
offers insight into what can hold off or mask the 
symptoms of the disease. Things like college 
education and an active intellectual life create 
an overabundance of connections that allows 
for the loss of some without marked changes 
in behavior.

The survival brain
The most primitive part of the brain includes several structures that serve 
the purpose of keeping you alive. Some literature simply refers to this brain 
area as the brain stem, but you may also read about it as the lower brain, 
the survival brain, or even the reptilian brain. (Take a look at the brain stem 
and other brain structures in Figure 2-2.) These nicknames may have arisen 
because the survival brain doesn’t think; it responds in a reflexive manner. 
Nor does this brain feel; the emotional brain is connected to the brain stem 
but not part of it.
Some researchers suggest that the brain stem and the amygdala in the limbic 
brain are really the decision-makers of the brain even though both are primi­
tive structures. The survival brain meets the basic needs of the body. Below 
are the definitions of several structures that make up the survival brain:
	
✓	The pons regulates respiration and relays sensory information between 
lower levels and upper levels of the brain.
	
✓	The medulla oblongata regulates heart rate and blood pressure
	
✓	The reticular formation or reticular activating system is brain’s first 
filter and alerts the brain to changes in the environment.
This primal structure, the RAS, receives all of the sensory input from your 
world. And as the brain’s first filter, the decision is made by this structure 
whether information reaches higher levels in your brain.

 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
As sensory information enters the brain in the form of sight, sound, taste, 
smell, and touch, the reticular activating system, or RAS, filters out unnec­
essary information. For instance, you don’t notice how your feet feel inside 
your shoes unless they hurt. The reticular activating system can’t absorb all 
of the incoming sensory information; it also won’t pay attention to input that 
doesn’t affect survival, isn’t novel, or is just plain boring. This filter is why 
getting through to others is not always easy.
Your reticular activating system is programmable. You sometimes program 
it unconsciously. Think about that car you fall in love with on the showroom 
floor when you take your old car in for service. It’s a beauty — shiny, red, 
great mileage, beautiful black leather interior. You want that car! As you drive 
around the city for the next several days, you keep seeing “your” bright red 
car. You have programmed your RAS to notice that car. You never realized 
how many people own your dream car. One of two things can now occur:
	
✓	You get so tired of seeing that red car that your brain habituates and the 
car blends in with all of the other cars; it’s not so special because there 
are so many of them.
	
✓	The excitement builds each time you see the car, and you want it even 
more!
Eventually, your higher level brain gets involved, and you weigh the practical 
side of the matter. Perhaps you can afford the car and buy it, or you see that 
the time is not right for a new car and let go of the desire.
The reticular activating system: Your brain’s decider
Some researchers believe that hundreds of 
billions of bits of information are available to 
the senses every second. The brain can pro­
cess only a few thousand of those bits, and so 
the reticular activating system (RAS) decides 
what your brain attends to. This survival brain 
structure makes these decisions based on 
your needs and desires. If you’re sitting at 
the airport waiting for your delayed flight, you 
find the area noisy as passengers mill around 
waiting for their flights. Perhaps you pull out a 
book to read while you wait. As you open The 
Leadership Brain For Dummies, you feel that 
your attempt at concentration will be futile as 
the noise level continues to increase with each 
plane that is delayed. Amazingly though, after 
five or ten minutes you’re totally engrossed in 
your book and don’t even realize where you are 
until you hear your flight called. Your RAS has 
filtered out the extraneous noise. That sound of 
the flight number and destination are wired into 
your survival brain because you really want to 
get to your destination. Your amazing reticular 
activating system allows only this information 
to enter your brain and change your focus. Had 
the loud speaker called your name, you would 
have responded just as quickly.

32
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
	
The survival brain’s reticular activating system has the following functions:
	
✓	Regulating wakefulness and sleep.
	
✓	Constantly scanning the environment for change. If incoming informa­
tion appears to be threatening, the brain stem releases molecules of 
the neurotransmitter norepinephrine to prepare the brain for the stress 
response.
	
✓	Keeping you sane. (It tries, anyway.) If you didn’t have this filter, you 
would be bombarded with sensory input that would eventually make 
you crazy.
The emotional brain
The Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz lamented that he needed a heart. The seat 
of emotions, however, is located in the middle part of the brain called the 
limbic system. The limbic system, or limbic brain, is often called the emo­
tional brain, but it does much more than deal with emotions. This brain 
includes the following important structures (see Figure 2-2):
	
✓	The amygdala is an almond-shaped structure that is the brain’s second 
filter. It helps store emotional memories. The memories themselves are 
stored elsewhere in the brain at higher levels, but the amygdala is said 
to catalog those emotional memories.
	
✓	The hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped structure, helps form long-term 
factual memories. Both semantic (or word-based) memories and episodic 
(event or autobiographical) memories are cataloged in this structure.
	
✓	The thalamus is the relay station for various kinds of memories. The 
thalamus sends visual memories to the visual part of the brain and audi­
tory memories to the auditory section. It is sometimes described as the 
brain structure in charge of external information.
	
✓	The hypothalamus is in charge of internal information; it helps regulate 
temperature, hunger, thirst, sex drive, and so on.
	
✓	Basal ganglia are a group of structures that partially surround the thala­
mus; the basal ganglia, regulate, initiate, and terminate voluntary move­
ment and emotion.
	
Because the brain has two hemispheres, each of these structures found deep 
in the brain (except for the basal ganglia) has a twin. One resides in the right 
hemisphere and one resides in the left hemisphere.

33
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
The hippocampus and the amygdala are directly related to memory. Because 
they’re right next to each other in the brain, storing emotional content that is 
also factual in long-term memory is easy for them.
The amygdala is so connected in the brain that when it receives a strong 
emotion, it sends out chemical signals throughout the brain — in a sense 
saying, “This is important information that must be remembered for sur­
vival.” The hippocampus gets this information at almost the same time that 
the amygdala does.
	
The hippocampus remembers factual information, and the amygdala remem­
bers emotional information. So the hippocampus knows who your best cus­
tomer is, and your amygdala knows whether you like her or not.
Information that has been accepted through the reticular activating system’s 
filter must pass through the amygdala, which is often thought of as the center 
of the limbic system or limbic brain. This is the second of the three brains, 
sometimes referred to as the gatekeeper, because it connects the lower and 
upper brain.
The amygdala is very responsive to fear and threat and will start a stress 
response under any threatening condition. The stress response was origi­
nally set up in the brain to respond to very real physical threats like lions 
and tigers and bears. (Oh, my!) In the 21st century, however, one person’s 
stressor may be another person’s pleasure. Your very dear friend may be 
thrilled at the prospect of climbing Mt. Everest while your heart races at the 
very thought of taking an elevator to the top floor of a building.
The stress response includes a rise in heart rate, rapid respiration, pupil dila­
tion, dry mouth, and upset stomach. The stress response can be brutal and 
damaging to brain and body. As your brain prepares for the stressor, your 
heart rate increases to get blood pumping to the correct areas: to your hands 
to fight or to your legs to flee. Your stomach upset is due to digestion coming 
to a screeching halt. The blood you needed to digest your food is sent to 
the extremities, as well. (Why digest breakfast if you may be breakfast?) 
Your heavy breathing gets oxygen where your body needs it. Hope that your 
immune system isn’t fighting any infections or disease because that process 
is going to stop as well. No need to worry about disease if you aren’t going to 
make it anyway! And your reproductive system may not be functioning at full 
potential either. Can’t worry about reproduction at a time like this.
	
The emotional brain filters and makes some decisions based strictly on emo­
tional input and prior emotional experiences. Sometimes it takes the low road 
and causes chaos when it may not be necessary. The emotional brain is pow­
erful and helpful, but it’s not always wise.

34
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
The amygdala is sometimes called the affective filter. It can keep the brain 
from thinking at high levels. Information stops in the emotional brain if 
incoming data is too emotional or if the brain already is in an overemotional 
state. Emotions are double-edged: Too little emotion finds the brain dropping 
some factual information because of boredom or insignificance, but too much 
emotion and the brain can’t send information up to the higher level.
Caught in the rough
Jim’s best client has been bugging him to golf 
at the country club. Jim likes to golf and has 
gone with Ralph on several occasions, but 
this Saturday Jim had planned to golf with the 
old gang from the technology department. Jim 
knew if he told Ralph he was golfing with some­
one else that he would sulk until Jim invited him 
along. But this time Jim begged off by telling 
Ralph he simply had some things he needed to 
get done and they would go to the club another 
time. Jim arranged with the tech guys to go 
to a golf course about twenty miles away in 
a small community and set the tee time for 7 
a.m. Ralph would be sleeping in for sure. And 
Jim was right. Ralph slept in. Jim forgot about 
Ralph’s wife, Stella. She played in a nine-hole 
league that traveled around to play at different 
courses.
Jim didn’t even think about the possibility of 
running into Stella until he was on the ninth 
hole and heard some females speed by on their 
way to the clubhouse. A blonde woman waved 
to Jim and said hello while the brunette next to 
her stared straight ahead. Can that be Stella? 
Jim’s mind raced to remember exactly what 
she looked like. “Oh, boy, am I in trouble,” he 
thought. “She must know Ralph wanted to golf 
with me because she sure gave me the cold 
shoulder.” Jim’s heart started racing just as 
his brain started searching for a way out of this 
mess. “Maybe she didn’t see me or recognize 
me and that’s why she didn’t look at me,” he 
thought. “She wouldn’t expect to see me here.”
As he walked up to tee off, his mouth was dry 
and his hands were unsteady. He swung his 
club and missed the ball. His buddies chuckled. 
His second attempt got the ball in the fairway, 
but Jim’s mind was scrambling. He had to find 
out whether he had really seen Stella, and if she 
had really seen him. Jim’s next swing hooked to 
the right and he ended up in the rough. It took 
him two shots to get out and he ended up chip­
ping his ball into a water hazard. His foursome 
was shocked. Jim finally made up an excuse 
that he didn’t feel well and left his foursome and 
went home. On the drive he tried to come up 
with excuses for Ralph. The entire weekend he 
played over and over in his head how the next 
meeting with Ralph would go.
Monday morning rolled around and Jim had a 
standing appointment at Ralph’s place of busi­
ness. Sheepishly, Jim walked in to Ralph’s 
office ready for whatever grief Ralph would dish 
out and hoping that an excuse that the in-laws 
came to town and he had to take them golfing 
may smooth things over. Ralph smiled when 
Jim entered, stood up, and shook his hand. “I 
had a great weekend, Jim. I’m glad we decided 
not to play golf. Stella convinced me that we 
needed some time away, and took a quick trip 
to Vegas for the weekend. I won $1,000!” Jim 
grinned and heaved a sigh of relief. He realized 
that he had ruined his golf game and his whole 
weekend over something that had never really 
happened.

 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
The thinking brain
When looking at the thinking brain, you can see its lobes, their locations, and 
their functions. (See Figure 2-3.) The topmost layer of the brain is called the 
neocortex, or gray matter. It is about one-quarter to one-eighth inch thick and 
consists of the neurons’ cell bodies. The neocortex is about the size of a large 
dinner napkin and so is folded in the skull. Beneath it is the white matter, 
also part of the thinking brain, it consists of those myelin-coated axons that 
send and receive messages from the top down and bottom up of the brain.
The two sets of four lobes of the brain have different functions:
	
✓	Occipital lobe: Located in the back of the brain behind the parietal and 
temporal lobes, this lobe is responsible for receiving and processing 
visual information.
	
✓	Parietal lobe: Located at the back of the top of your head, this lobe pro­
cesses sensory information as well as spatial awareness and perception.
	
✓	Temporal lobe: Located on the sides of your head above your ears, this 
lobe processes some speech, hearing, and memory.
	
✓	Frontal lobe: Located at the front of the top of your head, this lobe is 
responsible for decision-making, planning, judgment, and creativity.
As long-term memories form, parts of each memory are stored in various lobes. 
Visual memory is stored in the occipital lobe, auditory memories in the temporal 
lobe, and so on. Where the temporal and parietal lobes meet in the left hemisphere 
is a structure called Wernicke’s area. This is the brain’s mental lexicon filled with 
all of the words and definitions that you know. The frontal lobe holds another 
speech center called Broca’s area. Here your brain puts sentences together and 
activates the motor cortex, a strip on the top of your head that controls move­
ments involved in articulate speech. A pathway connects the two structures.
Notice in the figure the small structure at the bottom of the brain, beneath 
the occipital lobe. This is the cerebellum, which coordinates movement. 
Research is discovering that the cerebellum is a navigator of sorts for muscle 
movement and assists in navigating thought processes.
The frontal lobe is the last area of the brain to develop. It may keep matur­
ing through your mid-twenties, which means that you may not acquire some 
higher-level skills until then, either. The frontal lobe is the only structure in 
the brain that can control emotions. It acts as a damper for the more primi­
tive emotions of the amygdala.
The frontal lobe also contains a composition of neurons called the prefrontal 
cortex. Here is the true executive of the brain. It is probably the most inter­
connected structure in the brain as it must receive information from all other 
areas and send out commands to them, just as a leader needs to communi­
cate with all of her subordinates.

Thinking through three levels
Information entering the brain moves through its three levels as follows:
	
1.	New information enters the survival brain through the senses, which 
include sight, smell, touch, taste, and sound.
	
2.	The information is received in the brain stem and must pass through 
the reticular activating system, the first filter in the brain.
	
3.	If the brain stem sends the information higher in the brain, it enters 
the limbic system, or the emotional brain.
	
4.	The thalamus begins to relay the sensory information, and the amyg­
dala filters the information for emotional content and for emotional 
memories.
	
5.	Non-emotional information enters the hippocampus, which sends the 
information to the prefrontal lobe storage areas and other executive 
function locales (the thinking brain) to be examined for connections 
to prior knowledge.
	
	 If the brain has prior knowledge of the new information, the brain sends 
it back to the hippocampus, where new and old information are related.
	
6.	Finally, the new memory formed from combining the new information 
and the old information is sent back to storage areas in the neocortex.

37
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
	
The thinking brain is what separates us from other animals. The ability to plan 
ahead, make decisions, organize, and control our impulses is at the core of 
human brain development.
Thinking about thinking
Being able to stop, reflect, and think about how you’re thinking is a remark­
able gift that enables the brain to monitor how it is doing and then change 
according to its needs. As a leader, you use this strategy most of the time. 
When you encounter problems anywhere within your organization, you must 
think about what’s happening and make changes.
Your job is to not only take care of existing business, current employees, and 
present practices, your job is also to create. Creativity is part of the func­
tion of the prefrontal cortex. This is the area of the frontal lobe located right 
behind your forehead.
Perhaps your creativity led you to your leadership position. Possibly you 
have made changes in your business to create more business or better 
products that benefit your community, your society, or your world. Some sci­
entists believe that by exercising your prefrontal lobe you open yourself to 
more creativity. One of the ways to exercise this area is to learn new things. 
Take some of your business ideas and apply them in another way or to 
another field. Keeping your brain active and connected keeps it open to new 
ideas and original concepts.
Two Brain Hemispheres, 
Two Ways of Working
The specialization of the brain’s two hemispheres plays an important role in 
information processing. Although the hemispheres have separate functions, 
if you were born with only one hemisphere or had to have a hemisphere 
removed at a young age, the remaining hemisphere would take over most of 
the functions of the other.
Your two hemispheres are connected by a band of fibers called the corpus 
callosum. This large structure consists of axons that are coated with myelin 
and send information from one side of the brain to the other. Between 200 
million and 250 million fibers connect the two hemispheres.
When novel challenges arise in your business, you and your leadership team pro­
cess the information and create answers by using your right-hemisphere func­
tions. This doesn’t mean that you won’t be using your left hemisphere as well; 
humans are whole-brained. In the same fashion, your left hemisphere responds 

38
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
to familiar challenges. Leaders also lead with their left hemisphere when con­
fronted with challenges for which they’ve already established responses.
Some people naturally use more right- or left-hemisphere-directed thinking 
when approaching their lives.
Leading with your right: Novel challenges
To deal with novelty, your brain
	
✓	Thinks about the information holistically
	
✓	Focuses on the big picture
	
✓	Considers both pleasant and unpleasant aspects
	
✓	Considers gut feelings
	
✓	Synthesizes the information
	
✓	Uses its interconnectivity to gather information from other areas 
through its white matter
In addition, when receiving information from others, your brain notes the 
prosody and tone of the speaker, and it reads body language and gestures.
Intuition is said to be part of the function of the right hemisphere. As it interprets 
information it deals with the bigger picture — the forest rather than the trees.
If your leadership style uses more right-hemisphere-directed approaches, 
you most likely do some of the following:
	
✓	Present your vision in a graphic manner
	
✓	Use and respond to body language
	
✓	Gesture when you speak
	
✓	Speak metaphorically
	
✓	Prefer the picture rather than the thousand words
Leading with your left: Familiar challenges
Your left hemisphere has different functions from your right. Because it 
responds to familiar challenges and responds with routines that have previ­
ously been established, it will
	
✓	Function in a logical manner
	
✓	Check for details

39
 Chapter 2: The Science behind the Brain
	
✓	Analyze the information
	
✓	Review the sequence of the routine
	
✓	Use its gray matter to choose the appropriate routine
Left-hemisphere oriented leaders listen to facts, numbers, and other data. 
They listen more to the words others say rather than their tone of voice or 
body language.
If your leadership style lends itself more toward left-hemisphere-directed 
approaches you may
	
✓	Present information to employees and clients in a logical, sequential 
manner
	
✓	Share your vision in words
	
✓	Include a lot of data
	
✓	Analyze information and share that in written reports or prepared pre­
sentations
	
✓	Prefer the thousand words rather than the picture
How the hemispheres join forces
The way the hemispheres work is a good metaphor for how leaders plot a 
course for their organizations. The corpus callosum enables everyone to 
use both hemispheres, and most of what the brain does requires both even 
though one hemisphere may be more active than the other. A good leader 
has employees with different responsibilities, and together they work toward 
common goals. Like the left hemisphere, the leader makes some employees 
responsible for keeping the status quo by responding to situations in estab­
lished ways. Other employees are led to respond more like the right hemi­
sphere when they tackle new situations and create methods of dealing with 
those.
As novel challenges become more commonplace in the brain, the left hemi­
sphere fine-tunes the process created by the right hemisphere. In reality, 
they both receive the information simultaneously, but because the left hemi­
sphere has no immediate answer it awaits instruction from the right.
The brain moves you through time and space. The right hemisphere gives 
you the ability to think about where you are and where you want to be. The 
left hemisphere examines what occurred in the past, what is happening right 
now, and how it will affect the future.

The right person for the job
Edgar is the leader of his organization. He is 
a visionary. Edgar speaks in metaphors and 
paints wonderful verbal pictures for his work­
force to help them better understand the goals 
of their company. Some of his employees 
say his words are like a melody and his pres­
ence usually indicates that exciting things are 
happening.
One of the nearby universities approached 
Edgar about becoming a mentor for one of 
their leadership development students. Edgar 
thought it was a fine idea, and Tyra was sent to 
learn from Edgar. With notebook in hand, Tyra 
arrived ready to write down every move Edgar 
made. She had heard that his company was 
productive and successful, and she wanted 
to learn from the best. When Edgar spoke to 
his employees, Tyra wrote down his words, 
and when she had a few minutes alone with 
her boss, she questioned everything he said. 
Whenever he or his employees generated new 
ideas, Tyra wanted to know what made them 
good. She asked for data to share with her 
class. The more comfortable she became at 
the company, the more she questioned motives, 
rewards, and innovations. She began to drive 
Edgar crazy. Her body language clearly showed 
him that she didn’t approve of his leadership 
style. Rather than send her back to her profes­
sor, Edgar decided she needed a day as leader. 
He gave her full rein, and for one day she ran 
the company. Tyra arrived that day with memos 
for each employee. Included in the memo was 
their job description, and she asked that no one 
deviate from the description. She then asked for 
reports detailing their productivity from each 
employee at the end of the day. Tyra spent time 
in each department detailing system and pro­
cedural changes. She thought she was doing a 
magnificent job. At the end of the day she met 
with Edgar.
Edgar wanted to paint Tyra a picture of what 
she was doing, but he knew that wouldn’t sink 
in to her brain. She’s a lefty, he thought to him­
self. So he approached her with the facts in a 
logical, sequential manner. He showed her the 
daily productivity for each person and each 
department for every day that month. He had 
that information because he had people just 
like Tyra taking care of details for him. But they 
worked covertly. Every employee knew that the 
reports were made daily from the computer pro­
grams, but it wasn’t discussed unless it became 
necessary. When Tyra compared her leadership 
day’s reports to Edgar’s, she was astonished. 
Productivity was down. Innovation had halted. 
And from comments that were sent to Edgar, 
motivation was down. After looking over all of 
the facts, Edgar explained to her that she was 
trying to run a very tight ship. She was using 
her left hemisphere functions and not allowing 
her right hemisphere to get involved. He then 
had her list the traits that she was working with 
and compare them to his style. Edgar told her 
that she may be a great leader one day if she 
worked on a whole-brain approach. For now, 
he said, she was managing people and trying 
to control them with data and procedures. Tyra 
left that day knowing she was not the “right” 
person for this leadership position. She knew 
that she needed to learn more and balance her­
self more. The left/right hemisphere discussion 
she had with Edgar was a metaphor for leader­
ship. She realized that Edgar cared more about 
his workers than he did about the details, which 
didn’t mean he cared any less about the bottom 
line. In fact, his style was all about success and 
productivity for everyone.

urrent brain research is making the way the brain learns clearer. 
Knowing how the brain processes information, searches for meaning, 
seeks novelty, and pays attention offers leaders, trainers, and educators the 
tools to enhance their own and others’ learning.
Ask yourself how business and leadership have changed in the past 50 years. 
For a shorter list, ask yourself what hasn’t changed. Change is inevitable, and 
knowing how the brain learns makes changes faster and easier to process.
This chapter looks at the basic principles of learning. Based on studies, anec­
dotal evidence, and brain imaging, learning can be easy and should be fun! 
When it’s time for you to learn new skills to keep up with competitors and 
keep up with your workforce, will you be ready? After you read this chapter, I 
hope you can answer with an enthusiastic “Yes!”
The Brain Learns through Patterning
The brain seeks patterns that have been previously stored in long-term 
memory. As you train employees and work with customers, they search for 
patterns in what you say or experiences they can relate your message to.

42
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
As you try to persuade, convince, or simply present information to them, 
their brains search. You can’t convince a customer to buy a hybrid car, for 
example, if he has no idea what a hybrid is. First, you explain how a car nor­
mally runs. As you do, your customer draws on his car experience to under­
stand what you’re talking about. As you explain the difference between the 
normal car and the hybrid, he works from the pattern he just established.
	
You must help your employee or client find established patterns. You most 
effectively give them new information by adding to those patterns.
Patterns and schema
As you take a look at Figure 3-1, your brain immediately tries to find a pattern 
so that you can understand what you see. If I ask you what you see, some of 
you may say “Pac-Man” because the shapes bring to mind the pattern you 
have stored of the Pac-Man game icon. If this figure does not bring Pac-Man 
to mind or if I ask what else you see, you probably say a square or a four-
sided object. Is it really there? No. But as your brain tries to make sense of 
what it sees, invisible lines between the shapes appear in your mind.
A schema is an organized unit of information that your brain stores. Patterns 
form schema. Some people compare brains to filing cabinets. Using that met­
aphor, a schema is information stored in a file. Within that file is everything 
you know about something. You have a schema for your organization. In that 
file you have stored your mission, vision, goals, employees, productivity 
data, information about your working space, prior experiences at work, and 
anything else connected to your work.

The brain

43
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
Because neuroscience knows a lot about how the brain stores information, 
imagining that all of this information is stored in one file in your brain is an 
oversimplification. Each unit of a schema may be stored in a different part of 
your brain.
For example, as you recall a meeting with an employee, you picture that 
person’s face and body. These units of information are held by networks of 
neurons. One network holds the image of her face and another her body. You 
might also have a network that retains what she was wearing. These pictures 
are stored in the visual cortex at the back of your brain. When you remember 
what she said, you activate units in the auditory cortex. The conversation 
during that meeting is stored in yet another area of your brain, and you may 
have emotional memories of this meeting and other experiences with this 
employee that are stored in the emotional area of the brain. The networks in 
each brain area form patterns, and all of these patterns link together when 
you associate them by recalling the memory.
	
Neurons that work together form networks. Networks that interact form pat­
terns, and patterns combine to form schema. If you look at a painting, the big 
picture — the whole of the painting — constitutes a schema; the objects or 
people in the picture make up patterns, and the patterns are made up of tiny 
dots networked together.
As you encounter your world, your brain searches for patterns that fit into 
your schema, your particular view of the many situations you encounter. The 
different types of schema help you make your way in the world.
Your social schema determines how you behave around people in certain 
situations. If you receive an invitation to a black-tie dinner in honor of 
your chairman of the board, your brain immediately brings forth the social 
schema for this type of occasion. You would arrive on time, dressed in a tux, 
and behave in a formal manner. If an invitation arrives inviting you to a back­
yard barbeque, not only would your clothing be different, but your conversa­
tions and interactions would be less formal.
You may be creating your leadership schema as you read this book. If you’re 
already a leader, you have a schema embedded in your brain, but by read­
ing, learning, and asking questions, you may change some of the patterns 
there. As you watched other leaders on your way to this role, you may have 
adopted patterns that you liked and changed others that you observed did 
not work well. For instance, if you observed a leader yelling at an employee 
in front of others, you may have stored that in your brain as a pattern not to 
include in your own schema. But if you were listened to and viewed as a valu­
able part of an organization, you probably decided this was a behavior you 
want to imitate.

44
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Making connections
Neuroscience explains that knowledge grows when new neural connections 
align with those previously stored in memory. Information that relates to 
your previously stored patterns is easy to connect to the pattern.
The brain likes to think in stories, because the story form helps you fill in gaps. 
Your brain understands the pattern for stories — they have a beginning, a middle, 
and an end.
Dreaming gives a good example of your brain creating patterns. You have 
remnants of a crazy dream, little snippets: grandma in the bathtub, the phone 
ringing, yourself at work, the family dog barking. As you tell your dream to 
someone, it often becomes a story: “I was at work when my phone rang. It 
was my grandma. She was taking a bath and couldn’t get the dog to stop 
barking. I don’t know what she expected me to do from work!”
Procedures are a kind of pattern. Perhaps your workday pattern looks like this:
8:15	 Arrive at work
8:20	 Pick up messages and mail from assistant
8:25	 Grab a cup of coffee
8:30	 Return e-mail messages
9:00	 Meet with team leaders
9:30	 Check sales reports from previous day
10:00	 Begin day’s appointments
Sylvia in two worlds: The family schema
Sylvia is the CFO of an architectural firm that 
employs over 500 people. When Sylvia walks 
into a room, people feel her presence. She is 
charming, warm, and a power to be reckoned 
with. Under her financial leadership the com­
pany has doubled its revenue in the past four 
years, acquired two other firms, and opened 
three new offices. Sylvia is currently working 
on taking the organization overseas and creat­
ing a mentoring program for new hires.
Recently Sylvia went back to her hometown 
to visit her family. At home, you wouldn’t 
recognize the successful, motivated, hard-
working woman. She reverted to the “Sylly” 
that she had always been at her parents’ home. 
In essence, she became a child again. This 
regression is not at all unusual. Sylvia’s role 
in the family is one who is taken care of, who 
relies on others, and who gets to relax.
People tend to become the person they need to 
be for the environment they’re in and for those 
people in the environment.

45
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
Until 10 a.m., you don’t have to check your schedule; it is solidly stored as a 
pattern in your brain. Some patterns are procedures, and human capacity for 
procedures is strong. If your production team asks for a meeting time with 
you on Monday mornings, your pattern on Mondays is interrupted. Now you 
have to add this meeting to your pattern. You may have to rearrange your pat­
tern to fit the production team into your schedule, or you may just change the 
Monday routine and begin the day’s appointments a bit later, say 10:30 or 11. 
Adding to a pattern on a temporary basis isn’t going to change your brain, 
but because this is a permanent change for Mondays, your brain needs some 
time to change to the new procedure and store it.
A more major change is on the horizon if, for example, you have to change 
how you do business. The market is changing. Younger people are interested 
in your products. You decide to go global. Your marketing is going to be 
Internet-based. You have to hire tech people who know about advertising 
and your product. They must be part of the ’Net Generation, young and very 
tech savvy.
As you look at your business, you may see that your vision, your goals, and 
perhaps future products from research and development are components 
that help you create your schema. These help guide you as you redirect your 
business.
Such a major change requires a whole new way of thinking, which Figure 3-2 
illustrates. Your advertising schema consists of print advertising in newspa­
pers and magazines. But your ads aren’t paying off. You have a Web site that 
offers a modest overview of your product, but the site needs an overhaul. 
Your Web site and print advertising are part of your business schema, and 
now you begin to connect them more. Any print ads refer customers to your 
Web site, and your Web site provides links to online print information about 
the company. You begin to lay down new patterns as you add the Internet 
ideas that your new global marketing team creates. As you can see from your 
business schema, you have developed some new connections.
Even if your brain needs to connect opposites, the process works. In fact, 
the brain likes differences; they provide another way of sorting and organiz­
ing information. Knife and fork are stored in your brain under the category 
“eating utensils.” But their differences stand out more than their similari­
ties. One researcher puts it this way: Your brain stores by similarities, but it 
retrieves by differences. In your schema, you have items that you can sit on — a 
couch, a chair, a pillow, a bench — and each is stored in a generic group by 
what it’s used for. To recognize one of those items, your brain looks at the 
item and differentiates it from the others.

The Brain Needs Predictability
Put simply, predictability is knowing what’s going to happen next or expect­
ing certain things to occur. Inquiring brains want to know. The brain handles 
novelty and actually seeks it when it has a framework of predictability. In 
other words, if your brain is less stressed because you can count on certain 
predictable events, you can better handle the novel events that may cause 
some stress. Many schemas begin with expectations. The brain expects cer­
tain things to occur; when they don’t, the result can be interest — and often 
is stress.
Making it into the gene pool
If not for the survival skills of our ancestors, you wouldn’t be here today. 
They had to be smart. They had to be strong. They had to know when they 
were being threatened. In those days there were just two states of being 
related to predictability: You were being threatened or you weren’t. Even 
if you weren’t but thought you were, you reacted as though there were a 
threat. You responded as though your life depended on it.
Life today is not so different. Your brain reacts quickly to threat. Your amyg­
dala responds first, and your anterior cingulate cortex and your frontal lobe 
jump in to help. (Turn to Chapter 2 for more about the parts of the brain.) If 

47
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
they get the chance. Sometimes your amygdala is too quick, too scared. You 
want your amygdala to respond quickly to keep you from danger. If a fast-moving 
truck rounds the corner as you cross the street, you want your amygdala to 
act reflexively and make you jump back onto the curb. If you were interested in 
the color, style, and make of the truck, you would have to wait longer for your 
reflective frontal lobe and anterior cingulate to provide you with that detailed 
information. By then, it would be too late to get out of the way.
Even though the threats you face today are different from your ancestors’, 
they still call for decisive responses. All of your experiences provide you with 
information to best make decisions that keep you alive. Staying in the gene 
pool relies on your brain’s ability to recognize dangers via your amygdala, 
and make a quick response.
For survival purposes, your brain looks for opportunities to enrich your life. 
Perhaps becoming a leader is one of those!
Inquiring brains need to know
Stress is a situation, real or imagined, in which the body or brain is over­
whelmed. Stress interferes with learning, relating to others, and getting work 
done. Although the unknown is sometimes exciting, our brains want security. 
Have you ever attended a meeting without an agenda? Although some meet­
ings can be fun, most are considered obstacles to getting real work done. 
But without an agenda, how do you know when it’s going to be over? How 
can you plan for the immediate future? These are questions that prey on the 
brain of anyone who needs predictability.
I was recently part of a training program in Fairbanks, Alaska. It was a won­
derful program with a terrific training manual. The week’s agenda was placed 
at the beginning of the manual, but the trainer in charge of the planning 
forgot to pass out the daily agenda until midmorning. At the end of the day, 
the trainees had to submit exit cards stating one thing they had learned, 
one question they had, and one comment. Over 25 percent of the comments 
were, “The agenda should have been given out at the beginning.” The brain 
needs predictability. You may think that a missing agenda is no cause for 
alarm; however, new employees and trainees probably enter a training feel­
ing somewhat stressed. Any confusion or irritation compounds that stress.
What happens when the brain doesn’t know what’s going to happen next? It 
feels threatened. No lions or tigers or bears here; no real need to feel threat­
ened if you’re using your prefrontal cortex and looking at a situation in a 
logical, thoughtful manner. But when your emotional center (the amygdala 
and the rest of the limbic system) begins to imagine what horrible things 
could happen, the stress response kicks in. What do attendees focus on then? 
Worrying about what is going to happen rather than the content of the meet­
ing or training.

48
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
	
Anytime you can provide an outline, agenda, or other framework for your 
employees, you lower their stress levels. Knowing what the procedure is going 
to be gives the brain a feeling of control. Late meetings can be stressful for 
workers who need to get home to families or have personal plans. An over­
view of the meeting with a projected ending time can help people focus and 
contribute more.
The Brain Seeks Meaning
The brain more effectively remembers information and makes connections 
when an experience is meaningful — when it has clear relevance to your own 
life. Learning takes place either by connecting new information to old or by 
having a brand-new experience. Because new real-life experiences are some­
times hard to come by, making meaning through prior knowledge is easier. 
Your new employees and your veterans can’t connect on the same level 
because the new ones experience more novelty. As a leader, you therefore 
need to know how to present meaningful information to employees, inves­
tors, and customers. This section shows you how to make sure that you pow­
erfully present your vision and mission.
Linking meaning and memory
Making meaning and making sense don’t always provide the same response. 
If I tell you that I’m traveling from a town in West Virginia to a town in 
Virginia that is only two-and-a-half hours away and I am going to drive the 
distance rather than fly, that may make sense to you. But is it meaningful? 
Because the situation doesn’t concern you, you probably don’t care enough 
about it to save it in your memory. If information is going to be stored for the 
long-term, sense is not always enough.
Three levels of understanding exist in the brain:
	
✓	Sense: Understood, but not relevant or necessary
	
✓	Meaning: Understood and related to something else you know
	
✓	Personal meaning: Understood and related to a personal experience
Like the drive to Virginia, making sense isn’t always memorable. Imagine 
yourself walking through the supermarket looking for toilet paper. The first 
brand you see is called “Toilet Paper.” That makes sense. The second brand 
you see is “Two-Ply Toilet Paper.” There may be some meaning there for 
you because you have found that single-ply is used up too quickly. The next 
brand, however, hits home. “Soft, Strong Two-Ply Toilet Paper” reminds you 
that your spouse complained about the toilet paper feeling like sandpaper, 
and this personal connection may make it the perfect brand for you.

49
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
	
Metaphors and similes are effective tools for injecting meaning. Metaphors 
compare two dissimilar things: She is the rising star in our organization; he 
plows through his work. Similes are comparisons using like or as: She was as 
bright as the sun. The beauty of using a metaphor or simile is that it gets to 
the point and avoids useless or boring information. Your short-term memory 
can hold only five to seven bits of information at one time, and then for only 
thirty seconds. Comparing information to something else provides an immedi­
ate connection to another pattern and therefore sticks in your brain. The met­
aphor drives home an idea for your employee or customer to remember, 
enabling you to strike a note with your listener.
	
The brain drops any information or experience that isn’t meaningful. Some 
research suggests that the brain forgets or doesn’t even pay attention to 
almost 99 percent of incoming information. You’re competing to be part of the 
1 percent that your customers’ and employees’ brains take in!
Sense and senselessness
If experiences aren’t meaningful and don’t make sense, not only are they 
easily forgotten, but they can also cause frustration and stress.
Imagine, for example, that Bob goes to his local lawn-equipment store to pur­
chase his first riding lawnmower. As he checks out all the different models, 
Scott, a young salesman who just attended a two-day sales training on riding 
lawnmowers asks if he can assist. Bob tells Scott that he’s interested in a 
rider and knows very little about them. Scott unleashes a 30-minute detailed 
description, telling Bob about hydrostatic drive, PTO, pneumatic deck glide, 
and individually clutched drive wheels. (This approach is sometimes called 
the show-up and throw-up method of selling.)
Naturally, Bob becomes overwhelmed and is embarrassed to admit he under­
stood only a third of what Scott was saying. Bob thanks Scott for the informa­
tion and is about to escape when the store owner, who caught the last part of 
Scott unloading on Bob, steps in to try to save the sale. The owner, Tony, starts 
by asking Bob about his lawn — how large it is, how many trees and bushes 
are on it, and whether he gardens. Tony explained to Bob how the hydrostatic 
drive makes the mower easer to drive forward and backward, how the PTO 
operates a garden tiller, how the pneumatic deck glide cuts more evenly, and 
individually clutched drive wheels make trimming around trees a snap. Tony 
asks whether Bob has any questions or is unclear about any of the features. 
Tony answers all of Bob’s questions and writes up the salvaged sale.
Bob couldn’t make sense of Scott’s speech about the lawnmower. It might as 
well have been in a foreign language. Employees need to know when to offer 
detailed information to customers. Looking for a universal language that all 
understand is the first priority. Then, if a customer requests technical details, 
knowing your stuff may make a great deal of difference in making a sale.

The Brain Responds to Novelty
Some researchers describe a novelty center in the brain that responds to 
unusual or surprising circumstances. Initially, information moves to the hip­
pocampus, which helps you form long-term memories. The hippocampus 
tries to connect the information to a pattern that was previously stored as 
a long-term memory. When it can’t find one, it releases dopamine, the neu­
rotransmitter of pleasure, and causes the amygdala, your primitive emotional 
center, to react and enhance the memory. Because of the dopamine release 
that accompanies it, novelty motivates.
The first time the 1984 “Where’s the beef?” television commercial aired, view­
ers were captivated by the little old ladies peering into a giant hamburger 
bun and grumbling about its meager contents. The second time people 
viewed the commercial, they stopped to watch and listen. But eventually the 
novelty wore off; their brains were not as intrigued.
The brain must attend to unusual information because it may be related to 
your survival. Incoming data spurs the brain to rapidly ask questions like the 
following:
	
✓	Have I seen this before?
	
✓	Can I eat it?
	
✓	Will it eat me?
	
✓	Do I need it?
	
✓	Do I want it?
	
✓	Can I mate with it?
The answers to those questions determine an action or behavior. (If it’s going 
to eat me, I’m leaving. If I’m going to eat it, let’s fire up the grill!) The brain 
uses prediction to enhance survival. When a pattern enters the brain, the 
brain calculates what the effect or outcome will be. If the prediction doesn’t 
match, the brain becomes very active and attentive. In other words, the 
pattern or the schema failed, and the brain wants to know what’s going to 
happen and why. Because the amygdala and the hippocampus are excited, 
the novel situation has a better chance of being remembered well.
If the brain likes predictability, how can it also like novelty? The brain 
attends to novelty but doesn’t always like it. However, attending to novelty 
is part of the brain’s job. Novelty engages the brain and makes experiences 
interesting and memorable. Because the brain wants to be engaged, it scans 
its environment for novel things. Predictability actually has to come first: If 
you’re in a conventional environment, novelty is more tolerable. Stress levels 
are lower when predictability is in place.

 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
The Brain Needs Repetition
The fortunate part of speaking about the brain to audiences is that if you 
repeat yourself and realize it, you simply follow it with “Repetition is good for 
the brain!” And that is so true. And that is so true.
If you want to store information for the short-term, like a phone number, you 
repeat it until you can write it down or get it programmed into your phone. 
Long-term memory requires more repetition and connections to other informa­
tion already in your brain. Repetition sounds boring, but it doesn’t have to be.
Unexpected behavior stresses employees
Chuck is in a leadership position at a big-box 
store. He gets along well with everyone. He 
knows every employee’s kids’ names, what’s 
going on in their lives, and when they took their 
last vacation. He really cares about his people 
and shows it. Everyone in the store appreciates 
Chuck’s interest, and so they generally grant 
him a little leeway if he isn’t always the most 
organized boss. Because Chuck is so casual 
and also a very random thinker, he isn’t always 
prepared for his meetings. But he warms every­
one up by asking them questions about their 
personal lives, always has a big grin on his face, 
and charms them all. They feel safe and secure.
At one of the weekly Monday morning meetings, 
Chuck walks in silently. No smile. No “Hello, 
how are you? How are the kids?” This was a 
Chuck no one had ever seen. He walks to the 
front of the room where he usually hopped up 
on the desk and started speaking in his random 
way. But today he sits behind the desk. The 
employees are concerned. “Hey, Chuck, what­
samatter?” George asks. “Somebody die?”
Chuck looks up with an evil glance at George, 
and turns to his audience. He blurts out, “Our 
sales are so low, we might be closed! What 
is wrong with you people? Don’t you know we 
have quotas? Don’t you know you’re not meet­
ing yours? Aren’t I good to you?”
When he stops, the entire room is silent. 
Although some of the employees want to yell 
back at Chuck, they’re trying to figure out why 
they’re being attacked by the boss who is so 
easygoing. Rather than even thinking about 
what Chuck has said, they go into a fight-or-
flight mode where logical thinking doesn’t take 
place.
Janice is the first to speak. “I thought our meet­
ings were to boost morale. You never gave us 
quotas. We didn’t have any idea sales were 
down. Our meetings were always about solving 
little problems, changing schedules, and new 
hires. Why didn’t you tell us?”
The predictable store leader surprised his 
employees with uncharacteristic behavior. 
Because he didn’t begin his meeting in the 
usual way and instead began to attack his 
people, they became defensive. The novel 
behavior caused them more stress than neces­
sary. If Chuck explains the seriousness of the 
situation without throwing out unexpected and 
hurtful questions, he’s going to get the behavior 
from his employees that he needs rather than 
defensive looks and thoughts.

Learning to remember
The brain is better at forgetting than remembering. In fact, some researchers 
say that the brain is programmed to forget. It lets go of trivial or no longer 
relevant information to make space for more important information.
Temporary memory is divided into two types:
	
✓	Sensory/immediate memory is the shortest and allows only seconds 
for recognition of incoming sensory information. If sensory memory 
acknowledges the receipt of the information, then the immediate 
memory process begins. Immediate memory allows you about 30 sec­
onds to hang on to the fragile memory. You can do so by repeating the 
information to yourself (verbal memory) or you may create a picture of 
it (visual memory). If the information then can be attached to some pre­
viously stored patterns, the working memory process takes over.
	
✓	Working memory, a short-term memory process, takes information 
from sensory memory and can hold onto it for hours, days, and even 
months. But working memory, as its name suggests, requires work. The 
brain must engage with the information. For example, if you have just 
received the new commission rate for selling your product, you might 
do some calculating to find out how much you can make on each unit 
sold. Calculating is a working memory process. After you work this for­
mula repeatedly, it becomes a long-term memory.
You form long-term memories through repetition. Rote repetition, just repeat­
ing things over and over in the same way, is not a good way to get most infor­
mation into long-term memory. Elaborating on the information and repeating 
it in various formats makes storing the information in your brain much easier 
and more enjoyable.
Rehearsing to retain information
Consolidation describes the conversion of short-term memory to long-term 
memory. This process takes time and rehearsals of the information. Unless 
you have a strong emotional attachment to the memory, you need numerous 
rehearsals to store it.
Short-term memories become long-term memories that are easily accessible 
if the rehearsals involve many of the senses. For example, talking about the 
information, creating graphics, and role playing — which is especially effec­
tive if the memory is a process or procedure — are effective practice meth­
ods for learning a new computer program or a new sales approach.

53
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
How many repetitions are enough? Educational research shows that learning 
a new concept or skill might take a few dozen rehearsals. Your brain cells 
need time to go through the changes that convert a short-term memory into 
a long-term memory. Every time the neurons connect, cellular changes occur 
to ensure that the next connection happens quicker and easier.
The first time you drive to work you may go slower as you look for road 
signs and landmarks. Each day you get better at remembering the streets 
and other familiar sights. By the end of the first week, you’re a pro at getting 
to work. The mental map you have created becomes very powerful and even 
when you don’t have to go to work, you may find your car driving you there!
	
Repeated experience is what wires and rewires the brain. Although rote repe­
tition has its place in learning, elaborate rehearsal usually does a better job of 
creating strong, lasting memories. Strategies for elaborative rehearsal include 
categorizing, classifying, and forming auditory or visual images.
Vision is a more effective rehearsal tool than the other senses. Anytime you 
create a mental picture or even draw one that represents what you’re learn­
ing, you more easily remember it. Using mnemonic devices for visualization 
helps you rehearse information into long-term memory when the information 
is not easily associated with other material or easily connected.
Remembering names is difficult for most people. As a leader, a salesperson, 
or as anyone else who deals with new people often, using a visual strategy 
to help you remember is a good idea. People are more responsive when you 
use their names in conversation, and so remembering names is an impor­
tant business skill. Many individuals have trouble remembering names, and 
names have no synonyms — you can’t replace a person’s name with another 
word while you talk to them.
In one episode of the television sitcom The Office, Michael shares his mne­
monic strategy for remembering names. Michael goes around the room, shar­
ing the trick he uses for remembering each person’s name. He points to one 
person and says “baldy,” to the next person and says, “mole”; “sugar boobs” 
is the next person (a young lady with large breasts and a low-cut blouse).
“Baldy” is the guy with no hair, of course. His head is shiny, and Michael can 
see his reflection in it. Mirrors reflect; the word mirror starts with M, as does 
the man’s name — Mark. This is a long way to go to get to the name, but his 
strategy works for him.
	
Finding something significant about a person’s face and using it to help you 
visualize his name can be powerful. If Bill has bushy eyebrows, picture a dollar 
bill buried in those brows. If Lucy has large teeth, look at her teeth and imag­
ine that one is loose. (Loose = Lucy.) Choose a visual that works for you. You 
may find it helpful the next time you meet shareholders or potential clients. 
Just don’t share your strategy, like Michael did.

The Brain Learns through Feedback
Do you remember playing the “Hot and Cold” game as a child? Someone hid 
an object in a room while you waited in the hall. Then you were called in and 
started looking for the object. When you were close to it, you were told you 
were getting warmer; when you strayed away from the object, you were told 
you were getting colder. If you got very close to the object and still hadn’t 
found it, you were told you were hot or red hot. That game is a great example 
of getting feedback to let you know how you’re doing. Feedback is even more 
important in the leadership game.
Feedback works on the emotional system in the brain. Knowing whether you 
are hot or cold at your job brings out an emotional connection. And it acti­
vates more than the raw emotional center, it enables the brain to use higher-
level thinking skills to decide how to continue doing good work, make the 
good work better, or make changes to garner more positive responses and 
work harder toward company goals. Your leadership skills rely heavily on 
your ability to give and receive feedback.
Feedback is sometimes divided into two types: motivational and informa­
tional. Both types of feedback need to be timely — offered within a short time 
after the event at the heart of the feedback — to really make a difference. You 
can’t overrate the importance of timely feedback.
Feedback helps the brain stay focused on its target. Motivational feedback 
keeps up morale, and informational feedback enables employees to keep 
track of their accomplishments.
Making money by making memories
Have you ever thought of becoming a memory 
expert? You can compete in the U.S. Memory 
Championship or even the World Memory 
Championship. If you have a lot of time on your 
hands to practice the strategies (one champion 
learned the skills in jail), you might find a new 
career. Many audiences find this entertaining 
and pay you for your time.
The world-class memory champions memorize 
several decks of playing cards after an outsider 
has shuffled them. Their memorization often is 
a very short process that takes about five min­
utes. They accomplish it by using mnemonics or 
memory strategies. The strategies are so well 
rehearsed that the mnemonist (memory expert) 
simply attaches each card to a visual he has 
stored, such as an object in his home. These 
mnemonists often have five to ten objects in 
each room of their house that serve as their 
house files. As the cards are turned, the mne­
monist works around the first room attaching 
cards to each object, and then he moves on 
to the next room. After all of the cards have 
been turned, the expert tells the cards to the 
judges or audience in whatever order they want 
them — first to last, last to first, or just answer­
ing a question like “What’s the 77th card?”

55
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
Feedback works in both directions. You want your employees to provide 
feedback to you, too. I talk about his kind of feedback in Chapter 5.
Giving timely feedback
Timely feedback is often immediate: You see something you like, and you 
let your employee know. You want to comment while the task is still in the 
mind of the employee. Doing so is of particular importance if you’re working 
toward a specific goal and you want to keep the momentum going.
If you see some improvement, even in small increments, you provide verbal 
and maybe written feedback on the progress. New goals or time-consuming 
goals require intermittent feedback. People need to know how they’re doing, 
where you think they are in a process, and whether you’re looking for some­
thing in particular.
	
Specific feedback more effectively corrects or reinforces certain behaviors, 
enabling the brain to focus on something concrete, which it does do not from 
an “Atta boy!” type of reinforcement. The brain likes celebrations, so be sure 
to celebrate each success. If you decide to congratulate employees as a group, 
be sure to talk to each one personally as well. You find more information 
about giving employees feedback in Chapter 20.
Making feedback motivational
A high-performing team usually is made up of individuals who are self-
motivating. But for some employees, motivation doesn’t come so easily from 
within. Therefore, once in awhile you need to either provide a “pat on the 
back” of some sort, or in some cases a “kick in the pants” in a subtle and sup­
portive way.
The more time you spend as a visible leader walking around and observ­
ing, the more likely you are to catch someone doing something right. If you 
know your employees, this can prompt you to provide that pat on the back 
in the format most effective for the employee. For instance, if you know your 
employee likes to hear praise and be praised in front of others, you would 
say something loud and clear like, “Great job, Vickie, you’re responding to 
those customers in a manner that keeps them coming back!” Other employ­
ees may not like a public “atta boy” and prefer that you literally pat them on 
the back as you pass by.
	
A swift “kick in the pants” is something you do only on a face-to-face basis, in 
private.

56
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Occasionally you have a very visual employee who responds best when infor­
mation is spelled out, literally, in a note with step-by-step feedback that tells 
him how to improve. This type of written feedback is a little different from 
the informational feedback I describe in the next section. Informational feed­
back is usually written, but it keeps a running score of how the employee is 
doing.
Offering informational feedback
Besides giving your employees motivational feedback, you need to give them 
hard data. This informational feedback should be graphic. A picture is worth 
a thousand words. In an instant, employees can see their progress — or lack 
thereof. Along with the graphic, include specific suggestions for improvement 
and acknowledgment of jobs well done.
Goals help the brain focus. Using informational feedback based on goal 
attainment is fair and may be as encouraging as motivational feedback. 
Timeliness is as important for informational feedback as it is for motivational 
feedback. The process is more involved because it definitely involves graph­
ics and writing.
Some employers want to encourage competition, and so they ensure that the 
entire organization or department sees how everyone is doing. For example, 
in the customer service department, they post informational charts with the 
number of service calls and satisfied customers for each customer service 
representative. A quick glance at the ongoing status of each representative 
may inspire those not living up to the goal of service and satisfaction.
The Brain is Social
Our ancestors had to rely on each other to survive. Going out hunting for 
prey by oneself wasn’t a wise thing to do. In groups, hunters had eyes in all 
directions to help protect themselves and find more food. At home, the fami­
lies stayed together for protection, comfort, and sharing. This social system 
resulted in brains accustomed to working and living with other brains.
Social gain or brain pain
Social status affects the brain in different ways depending on whether one is 
going up or down the social ladder. Studies suggest that the brain responds 
positively to the possibility of social gain at work. That status is based on 
work, productivity, and sometimes personality. Social hierarchies develop in 

57
 Chapter 3: Discovering the Elements of Learning and Memory
all species, and the brain’s need to find a place in its environment overcomes 
even the most valiant attempt at eliminating hierarchies and treating every­
one equally.
In any organization, you find someone at the top of the ladder who pro­
duces more, has more energy, and gets along well with others. This outward 
appearance of social rank leads other brains to believe that someone is at the 
bottom of the ladder.
Brain scans have shown that those who believe they’re on top or on their 
way up in the social strata show activation in the emotional center of the 
brain, the amygdala, and in the frontal lobes, where planning takes place. A 
brain that feels inferior may become motivated and focus more attention on 
productivity. Others may feel the situation is hopeless and activate the emo­
tional pain areas in their brains.
	
Brains place great importance on hierarchies. Although not all relationships 
are hierarchical, knowing who’s in charge and who isn’t is a priority at work. 
The more stable the environment, the less likely problems such as lack of 
motivation are to occur. If all stakeholders see the possibility of a positive 
change in social status, the environment becomes more stable.
Social success or stress?
Leading the social brain requires a knowledge of oneself, an empathic brain, 
and an understanding of stress. The social brain seeks social success in every 
aspect of life. Because most of one’s day is devoted to work, being accepted, 
admired, and well-liked is especially important to workers. Protecting your 
employees from social stress is impossible, but dealing with it is necessary.
Feeling successful in social situations at work causes the release of feel-good 
chemicals. But even an employee at the top of the social ladder may lose his 
footing. The brain responds in a negative way when challenging work experi­
ences make an employee feel as though he looks bad to others.
How serious can stress at work become? Stress at work can cause health 
problems. Anytime stress levels are chronically high, the immune system 
can be affected. This can cause mental health problems, such as depression 
and anxiety, or physical problems. Physical health issues as common as the 
cold may be a result of a fragile immune system. Health issues lead to lower 
productivity due to absences or an inability to focus. Workers who are per­
sistently missing work due to illness often return to a situation feeling out of 
sync in regards to expectations and what has been missed. This can cause 
more stress and continue the cycle.

58
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Feeling like the underdog causes the brain stress, and the brain directs that 
stress elsewhere. Often, the brain interrupts whatever is taking place that 
makes it feel stressed. Feeling comfortable again with the content of a meet­
ing or project, reduces stress and enables an employee to become a team 
player again.
	
A disgruntled team member may unconsciously delay work on a project. Doing 
so reduces his stress about not knowing what he is doing, not being accepted 
by others, or being afraid to speak up about a personal conflict with the project.
Social stress may be alleviated by some of the following:
	
✓	Reviewing the way decisions are made, work responsibilities, and how 
conflict can be resolved
	
✓	Taking the team out of the office for a social lunch to help everyone feel 
included
	
✓	Creating a support group in the company in which anyone can 
participate
	
✓	Immediately meeting with any team member who is slowing down 
progress to discuss any problems
	
✓	Making sure team members get recognition for their contributions
	
✓	Providing a suggestion box in which employees place thoughts 
anonymously
	
Remember that team leaders are often trying to lead their peers. Doing so is 
no easy task, and so checking in with these leaders to see how they are coping 
with their own social stress is a good practice.

W
hat happens in the brain to make someone a leader? The debate has 
been ongoing and the results are becoming clearer. Researchers 
assert that your brain can learn anything. The brain’s plasticity enables it to 
keep changing no matter your age.
Many leaders emerge later in life. Some people find their passion when 
they’re young, but for others, finding that passion takes half a lifetime. 
(Maybe a midlife crisis is really no crisis at all.)
Leadership doesn’t necessarily extend to all areas of your life. Most leaders 
direct their passion to one or two aspects and follow in others. The knowl­
edge required, the time demanded, and the amount of stress embedded in 
leadership limits the desire to lead.
In this chapter, you find out how leaders are made, how to take action, and 
how to share your vision. To be a leader or to remain a leader, you need 
to continuously develop your skills, goals, and relationships. To become a 
leader, you have to have followers. To have followers, you have to instill a 
dream and the opportunity to be part of that dream.
Considering a Leadership Gene
Whether human DNA includes a leadership gene is a topic for great debate. 
(No such gene turned up through the Human Genome Project.) Are you born 
with leadership ability or is it learned? Most leadership and brain experts 
agree that the brain is malleable and under the right conditions can develop 
leadership skills.

Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Nature versus nurture
Have you become who you are because of what you inherited genetically 
from your parents or because of how your parents raised you? Whether you 
have blue, green, or brown eyes is a product of genetics. Your height is deter­
mined by nature; so is your hair color (and whether you keep your hair or go 
bald).
The genetic influence might not end at physical factors; some noted scientists 
believe that genetics play a role in behavior and personality traits. But this is 
where the connection between nature and nurture begins. A child born with a 
trait called shyness can be nurtured into becoming a less shy or even outgoing 
individual. That is, the genetic component can be changed or compensated for. 
The child’s environment and how the child is mentored by her primary care­
givers makes all the difference. The brain’s neuroplasticity, its ability to change 
through experiences, enables the child to overcome shyness.
For example, you’re genetically programmed for language. At birth, you have 
the ability to learn any of the 6,000 languages spoken on Earth. The language 
that you hear is the language you learn. If you were fortunate enough to be 
raised in a multilingual environment, you may be proficient in more than one 
language. The bottom line is that nature (the ability to learn a language) and 
nurture (learning the language of those in your environment) combine and 
form your language abilities.
And so it goes with leadership. If a leadership gene is eventually discovered 
as the scientists study the 30,000 genes in the human genome, it will be only 
a starting point for the discovery of how a person becomes a good leader. All 
of the factors that affect the brain would be involved in whether that gene 
is expressed, or actively used. Certain genes are turned on and turned off 
throughout our lives. Some genes remain inactive until an experience creates 
a need for them — kind of like library books just sitting on a shelf until you 
crack one open to find the information you need. Lifestyle, nutrition, environ­
ment, experiences, and relationships are only some of the factors that affect 
that process.
Born to lead
You have probably heard someone called a “born leader.” According to the 
research, such a person may not exist. Everyone knows of motivating, inspir­
ing, knowledgeable people with visions that have others willing to do any­
thing to follow them. Think about some of those leaders who charismatically 
created a large following: Barack Obama, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mahatma 
Gandhi, and Golda Meir. Although you may not agree with the visions of all 
of these leaders, they did, indeed, lead many people to their way of thinking. 
But were they born to lead? Most people believe that leadership is learned 
from others or through experience. If you’re willing to learn to interact with 

61
 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
others on an emotional level, you can get others to see things the way you 
see them. You can also learn to express empathy when dealing with others’ 
personal and professional situations. With these skills, you’re on your way to 
leading.
Educators often say of their classes, “If I could only pick their parents!” 
Birthright creates many people who get to be leaders. Some are born into 
royal families with titles bestowed upon them, but that good fortune doesn’t 
necessarily make them leaders — especially if the leaders who came before 
them did not model good leadership skills. Their genes allow them the right 
to take over the organization, but do they have credentials beyond family 
connections?
	
Leadership skills aren’t hereditary. The desire to lead may be instilled by your 
role models, but the characteristics of good leaders are learned.
Leading opportunities
Your genes change and respond to your environment. They can’t work with­
out the amazing effects of your brain’s differing levels of neurotransmitters, 
hormones, oxygen, water, and nutrients. These levels are affected by the 
foods you eat, the culture you live in, your stress levels, and the amount of 
sleep you get — to name just a few.
If someone inherited a potential for great leadership but never got the oppor­
tunity to lead, his potential would never be reached. Some business experts 
believe that everyone has leadership potential and with the right situation, 
opportunity, and passion for an idea, can effectively lead.
Leadership is learned, but sometimes the people around you teach you in an 
unconscious way. From their backgrounds and their passions, some employ­
ees have an ability to connect with others, and their observation skills enable 
them to rise to the occasion when a leader is needed.
Our nature is to nurture
Nurturing seems to be hard-wired into human brains. The release of the brain 
chemical oxytocin occurs in the brains of parents when their babies are born. 
This bonding chemical encourages the brain to nurture the new life. Survival 
necessitates relying on others and being relied upon in return. Taking care of 
others not only helps perpetuate the species but is vital to personal growth. 
As you nurture relationships in your life, you create relationships that pro­
vide emotional and professional support.

Outlining Leadership Attributes
Wanted: Person or persons with perfect decision-making skills; the abil­
ity to communicate flawlessly with superiors, subordinates, board mem­
bers, and clients; and listening skills so superior that you understand 
what is being said as well as what isn’t being said. Must be calm in the 
face of adversity and able to inspire others. If you’re interested in bring­
ing out the best in others and in yourself, inquire within. Unqualified per­
sons need not apply unless willing to learn all of the above and more.
Don’t worry. You can develop all of these skills. The upcoming sections get 
you started.
See Art lead
Art has a plan: Go to the best school, get the 
best internships, work for a good company, 
and look for the possibility of getting in on the 
ground floor of a start-up business. From there, 
he wants to learn from leaders, work with lead­
ers, and if a leadership opportunity presents 
itself, jump at the chance. His plan works better 
than he expected. Art has never been much of 
a leader in school or in organizations that he 
belonged to; he just knows that this is what he 
wants. The “ground floor” of the new business 
is literally the ground floor. The first floor of 
an older building a bit off the beaten business 
path provides the shell of this new computer 
consulting start-up. Art begins as one of the 
worker bees, but he wants to always keep his 
eye on the prize. So he watches the CEO and 
the CFO, listens to their decisions, and makes 
mental notes of their actions.
Not wanting to tell his peers what to do, Art 
builds good relationships with his peers so he 
can offer suggestions without sounding like a 
know-it-all. With humor and enthusiasm, he 
creates an environment in which he can use his 
prior knowledge to help his peers. All the time, 
though, his eyes are watching and his ears are 
hearing what the leaders say and do.
Soon enough, his colleagues are working well 
together and accomplishing the goals they have 
set. Art has them working like an orchestra, and 
he conducts less and less as they all begin to 
do their jobs well and he offers to participate in 
other projects not related to his team.
What Art doesn’t know is that while he is 
observing the leaders, they are watching him. 
Because they themselves are exceptional lead­
ers, they have been keenly observing every 
employee as they look for leaders. They know 
Art has taught the newbies a lot, has set them 
up for independence, and not only does his own 
work but works on other projects sometimes 
moonlighting to do so. The CEO approaches 
Art, tells him what a great job he is doing, and 
offers him a project of his own. Art thanks him 
and tells him how he appreciates the chance 
to prove himself as a leader. The CEO smiles. 
He knows what Art doesn’t yet. That he has 
already proven himself as a leader, and now 
he is moving on to a much bigger leadership 
opportunity.

 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
Taking the actions that make the leader
The list of leadership attributes is endless, but if I were going to create an 
inventory of traits that no leader can be without — attributes that would 
please the brains of most employees — it would include those in the upcom­
ing sections.
Be in touch
Let your employees know that you’re with them, which gives them a sense of 
security and calms the emotional area of the brain. When emotions are calm, 
you’re less likely to initiate the stress response, and instead your brain is 
open to new information and responds better to others. In our global society 
it is easy to be in touch as a leader. You can tweet your way into the lives of 
your employees on a daily basis. By using the social network Twitter, you 
can send messages to every employee, letting them know where you are and 
what you’re doing. You can call a meeting in a matter of seconds, and send 
short important messages.
Be visible
You want to be certain that employees see you on a regular basis. One senior 
leader makes certain that she visits each team every day. She may give only a 
quick greeting and ask whether they need anything, but she’s there for them 
to see.
Visibility is advantageous for three reasons. First, it provides your employees 
with the knowledge that you care and are approachable. Second, it enables 
you to always know what is going on. Take every opportunity to work among 
your employees, greet them, and treat them with respect. Third, it lets 
employees know that you are ready to join in and help if needed.
Hone your communication skills
Your brain is hardwired for language. Individuals with good communication 
skills get promoted more often and rise to higher levels in organizations. 
Communication is a two-way street; to be an effective communicator, you 
have to be a good listener as well as a good speaker. Whether communicating 
face to face, via the Internet, or through text messages and cell phones, make 
sure you relay your message at the level of understanding of the persons 
receiving it and listen carefully to responses. Workers who feel that informa­
tion is shared with them stay in their jobs longer and are more motivated — 
maybe because communication activates both the language centers and the 
emotional centers in the brain.

64
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Keep your emotions in check
Make sure that you can lead yourself before you begin leading others. Keep 
a handle on your emotions. Use them to help you make decisions, but don’t 
let them use you. Decide who’s in control. Your brain is easily overwhelmed 
with emotion unless you have learned to use your prefrontal cortex, the exec­
utive of your brain, to temper those raw emotions. Doing so requires that you 
practice emotional intelligence skills I describe in Chapter 8, such as the abil­
ity to recognize your emotions. As you begin to recognize them, you can also 
determine the best way to handle them.
Inspire teams
You can’t be a leader if you don’t have any followers. Be the type of leader 
who walks with your teams, not in front of them. You may turn around one 
day and find that you are alone.
The brain is social and gregarious. Offer yourself, your hopes, and your goals 
to the teams making things happen for you. You inspire by being able to 
explain complex issues in a way that your followers understand.
Your self-confidence that the job can be done or the goal can be reached 
inspires them to work. Show them that although you make mistakes, you pick 
yourself up and try again. These kinds of inspiring behavior stimulate the 
brain’s emotional centers.
Sharpen your decision-making skills
As you see in Chapter 9, knowing how to make rational decisions and snap 
decisions is part of leading others. To sharpen those skills try the following:
	
✓	Practice identifying problems and presenting them simply.
	
✓	Invite brainstorming to create as many possible solutions as you can.
	
✓	Determine consequences for each possible solution.
	
✓	Activate your decisions and follow their outcomes.
You instill a sense of safety and security in your employees when they can 
count on your good decision-making skills.
Know your people
People need to feel connected to others. The leader who gets to know his 
employees both professionally and personally has an easier time motivating 
them and getting them to make changes, and those employees who feel con­
nected to their superiors like their jobs better.

65
 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
I ask every executive that I come into contact with what they do to get to 
know their staff. Most have individual meetings with each employee to find 
out what they like or dislike about work. They also find out about their per­
sonal goals and desires. This is effective for most leaders, but it’s not nearly 
as much fun as the parties that other leaders have. Parties, retreats, and 
games may sound like child’s play, but the brain loves to play and learns 
through play as well. Give your employees the opportunity to let their hair 
down and really talk to you and to their colleagues.
	
The brain is social; interaction provides a feeling of importance and self-
confidence found in the limbic system and frontal lobe.
Place others’ needs above your own
When you talk to your employees ask them what they want from their jobs, 
what their future goals might be, and what needs they have that have not 
been met. Helping your employees achieve their best and expand their 
careers helps your company in the long run. If your workers believe that you 
will help them, they will be more willing to help you meet your organizational 
goals. Your interest provides a feeling of belonging and increases the release 
of feel-good neurotransmitters including dopamine and serotonin.
Lead people where they want to go
If they want to go, why don’t they just go? Fear — the same fear that keeps 
many people from becoming leaders. Your inspiration and the fear that you 
conquered give your followers the courage to walk with you. As their fear 
subsides, their levels of the stress hormone cortisol fall as the levels of dopa­
mine, the reward chemical, rises. Find those who share your vision, who 
want to make things happen, and who want to make a difference.
Keeping expectations high
High expectations tend to support high productivity. Employees live up to 
what you expect of them. Setting clear expectations defines the boundaries. 
Within those parameters, you may expect creativity and new ideas. What you 
don’t want is everyone in your organization doing their own thing or doing 
the same old thing.
Expectations provide predictability, which lowers stress and allows your 
employees’ brains the freedom to create change in the form of new ideas, 
new products, and new processes.

66
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Do your employees know what your expectations are? If an outsider were to 
come into your company and ask any employee to name his department’s 
goals for the month, could he answer? When you hire a new employee, she 
knows her job description, but job descriptions change, and you need to 
keep employees up to date about job descriptions and expectations.
	
Keep expectations clear, and track employees’ progress by doing the following:
	
✓	Meet with all who report directly to you and find out whether they know
 
• The expectations you have of them.
 
• The expectations of everyone who reports to them.
 
• The job descriptions of all who report to them.
	
✓	Meet with your direct reports on a regular basis to discuss how their 
work is affecting the goals and expectations of the company.
	
✓	Post your expectations throughout your building, offices, factories, and 
so on.
	
✓	Treat your employees as if they can meet all expectations.
	
✓	Accept nothing less than what you expect; make time for revisions.
	
✓	When time is at a premium and revisions aren’t possible, keep a watch­
ful eye on progress.
	
✓	Motivate your workers regularly; become a cheerleader.
A fair lady
All people tend to live up (or down) to expec­
tations that others have of them. The George 
Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion has an extraor­
dinary line in it. The play is about Professor 
Higgins, who claims he can take an ordinary 
flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, and pass her off as a 
lady — and does just that. After Higgins’s train­
ing, Doolittle says, “The difference between a 
flower girl and a lady is not in how she behaves, 
but rather in how she is treated.” Her point, 
which has become known as the Pygmalion 
Effect, has been seen in schools in which 
teachers are assigned students and are told that 
the students are gifted when in reality they have 
had little success in school. The teachers treat 
them as though they are gifted, and the students 
rise to the expectations and do very well.
The Pygmalion Effect and other studies show 
that you get what you expect. High expectations 
along with proper training encourage employee 
growth and increase productivity.

67
 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
Expecting (and embodying) integrity
One of the most important characteristics of an effective leader is integrity. 
The leader who is honest, respects herself and her employees, and holds her­
self accountable for her actions is the leader to follow.
You learn integrity through life experiences. Just as you learned integrity 
from the significant others in your life, your employees can learn it from you.
	
Your thoughts, feelings, and actions must align in every aspect of your life. If 
you don’t match your actions or behaviors to your values, you come across 
to your employees as untrustworthy. Each experience in which you exhibit or 
practice integrity makes it more likely you can continue that pattern.
Your morals and values are found in the frontal lobe of your healthy brain. 
You judge yourself and others in this brain area. You know when you’re 
about to do something wrong, and the feelings associated with this knowl­
edge keep you from doing it. You can see the consequences of such actions 
and you know they can make you feel awful, so you take the high road.
	
With the dishonesty of leaders making the news, trusting leadership is very 
difficult for employees and customers. One Enron makes it harder for numer­
ous leaders to lead — and the ripple effect of distrust goes on for years. Run 
your business as the perfect role model, and whenever corporations are 
exposed as frauds, show your employees in yet another way the integrity of 
your business.
Developing emotional intelligence
I devote an entire chapter (Chapter 8) to the discussion of emotional intel­
ligence, but the topic deserves mention here, too, because understanding 
yourself and others is key to leadership.
Dealing with employees’ and clients’ emotions has typically been considered a 
soft skill — one that directly relates to people’s feelings rather than business. But 
21st century leaders must use more than their cognitive skills, they must be able 
to lead others using their emotions and emotional intelligence competencies.
Leaders are under an enormous amount of pressure. Pressure causes the 
brain to operate at a lower, more instinctive and reflexive level. Old habits 
and patterns begin to appear, and the stress and frustration spread through­
out the organization. You may begin to seethe or micromanage in order to 
get control. As one very wise (and very brave) member of my team said to 
me, “What’s out of control in your life that you’re trying to control mine?” She 
was right on the money with that question. It caused me to pause and reflect. 
Given time, I discovered where my issues were and set about fixing those, 
instead of trying to fix her work (which didn’t need it at all).

68
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
You are bombarded with information, requests, denials, and problems 24/7. 
Understanding your emotional responses helps you deal with the challenges 
you face, and taking into consideration the emotions of others makes you a 
leader with powerful influence.
You need more than your rational brain when dealing with others. Your gut 
feelings tell you whether you’re making the right choices and going down the 
right road. Acknowledging both your rational thoughts and your feelings is 
part of being an emotionally intelligent leader.
Comparing effective and 
ineffective leadership
The leadership attributes that I tell you about in the previous sections are 
undeniably important. But many of you have — or wish you had — other 
characteristics that make great leadership qualities.
I want to be like Mike. No, not Jordan. Mike Mercer was my first real leader. 
He didn’t micromanage. He inspired. Using humor, creativity, hope, a sense 
of right and wrong, and his power in positive ways, Mike created a team that 
was unstoppable.
After that example of good leadership, here’s an example of its opposite. I 
will call him John. John micromanaged everything. He wielded his power 
whenever possible. In the beginning, he kept professional development to a 
minimum. When desperation hit, he threw professional development at us. 
No choices, no input, no way. John is what I call the “What have you done 
for me lately?” boss. Make him look good or add to his bottom line and you 
can be his favorite employee. But mess something up or remain behind the 
scenes and you get little positive response or recognition.
Walking the walk
Integrity boils down to the saying, “Walk the 
walk, don’t just talk the talk.” Honest people 
want to work for, be close to, and emulate 
honest people. Gandhi was famous for his 
integrity. As one story goes, a mother traveled 
many miles to take her young son to meet with 
the leader. She asked Gandhi to tell her son to 
stop eating sugar because it wasn’t good for his 
health and would rot his teeth. Gandhi listened 
to her request and told her to come back in a 
month. Disappointed and angry the woman took 
her son and left, but did return a month later. 
When the boy approached the leader, Gandhi 
took his hands and said, “Do not eat sugar. It 
is bad for your health.” The mother looked at 
Gandhi and asked why he had not warned the 
boy at their first visit. Gandhi looked at her and 
said, “Because, Mom, I was eating a lot of 
sugar myself, then.”

69
 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
And then there’s Lucy Goosey. Here’s a leader who has potential. She doesn’t 
micromanage, but she has no organizational skills, either. Fly by the seat of 
her pants Lucy. She calls meetings at the last minute, and usually cancels 
prescheduled meetings. Lucy often leaves early, or she may come in late. As 
long as you know your job, you’re okay — unless she doesn’t like you. She’s 
too nice to fire people, so Lucy ignores or somehow mistreats her employees 
until they get fed up and quit. Lucy’s decision-making skills are almost nonex­
istent. She lets her indecision make the decision. Oops! It’s too late to bid on 
that project! Oh, well, another will come along.
What kind of leader do you want to be? Take a close look at the characteristics 
of Mike, John, and Lucy in Table 4-1. Clearly, Mike is the best leader. If you 
have some of the traits of either of the other two “leaders,” you might want to 
reevaluate your actions as well as your motives for becoming a leader.

Encouraging Success through Leadership
A leader’s success depends on the success of his employees. Bringing out the 
best in others is what flourishing leaders do. In this section I share several 
ways that you can help others succeed.

70
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Imagine employees’ possibilities
Your bottom line is getting the results you want. Your employees help you 
get there. To use the greatest attributes or talents of each individual makes 
sense, and many leaders do just this. Don’t stop there. Let them stretch 
themselves and work on their weaknesses.
Where do you begin? The following are starting points:
	
✓	Take a look. Observe your employees as they perform their duties. Keep 
track of how they interact, at what speed they work, and what they seem 
very good at.
	
✓	Take some time. Discuss with each employee the strengths that you 
see. Then discuss what you and they see as a weakness. Find out how 
interested they are in working on areas in which they’re less proficient.
	
✓	Offer help. Send them for trainings in areas of weakness if you believe 
building a particular skill is important.
	
✓	Try it out. Give them the opportunity to build up those weak points. Let 
them know that you don’t expect perfection. Failure is disappointing, 
but you learn from trial and error.
Let your employees know what value they have to the company. If they share 
your vision, acknowledge how much more valuable they can be if their weak­
nesses turn into strengths.
Provide useful feedback
Whether you have one employee or thousands, staying connected through 
useful feedback is not only possible but critical. Even if you’re new to the dig­
ital game, connecting to your workforce is valuable; not connecting is wasting 
a lot of time and potential interaction.
Personal meetings are not always appropriate or easy to schedule. Of course 
your direct reports can provide feedback to many of your employees, and 
other team leaders can be doing so, as well. But how can you reach them all? 
How can they know you’re watching, supporting, and that you care?
Remember that providing feedback is one of the most important attributes of 
a leader. Find ways to provide feedback individually and to the organization 
as a whole. Try some of the following:
	
✓	Online newsletter: Post a weekly or bimonthly newsletter that shares 
recent progress, achieved goals, personal victories, and new projects or 
customers.

71
 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
	
✓	Twitter: Tweet employees whenever something new is happening, some­
thing good has happened, or something is about to happen.
	
	Look into using Yammer, which is a communications tool like Twitter, 
but that provides security, so that only employees with a company 
e-mail address can use it.
	
✓	Video conferencing: Video Web conferencing makes a large organiza­
tion smaller. The Internet enables you to have face-to-face contact with 
employees in your building or on the other side of the world.
Mentor and coach
A mentoring or coaching program may be just what your organization needs. 
Assisting new hires in adjusting to their new surroundings is just one aspect 
of mentoring. Large corporations, like Microsoft, use mentoring programs to 
sustain high-performing employees and prepare some for leadership posi­
tions. High-performance athletes use coaches in the same way as businesses 
use them: for encouragement, motivation, teaching, and maintaining success.
	
Make sure your business is in a position to handle a coaching program before 
you proceed. The time is right if
	
✓	You and your employees have time to meet.
	
✓	Several employees are interested in having or being a mentor.
	
✓	The office climate is healthy, and business is going well enough that this 
program won’t be a burden. (You don’t want to lay someone off in the 
middle of this program!)
Before you can match up mentors and mentees, you need to establish clear 
goals. The following are possible goals for the program:
	
✓	Making sure that you have the right person in the right position
	
✓	Helping new employees adjust to the work environment
	
✓	Encouraging leadership roles
	
✓	Reinforcing strengths, assisting with weaknesses
	
✓	Modeling acceptable work habits
	
✓	Clarifying work expectations
	
✓	Working as a team
A successful mentoring program hinges on crafting productive matches 
among employees. Just as Yenta, the matchmaker in Fiddler on the Roof often 
had trouble finding perfect matches, creating a mentor/mentee team that 
works is likely to be a challenge for you.

72
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Take into consideration the following kinds of compatibilities:
	
✓	Match the novice and veteran employees. The veteran may be able to 
share information about the position, the environment, and successful 
approaches to the job.
	
✓	Pair an employee who has a particular weakness with an employee 
who is strong in that area. If the employee is interested in developing 
her weakness, the other employee can model the strengths and explain 
how to improve.
	
✓	Compare professional goals and match those with the same goals. 
Employees who value the same purpose may have a lot of other 
commonalities.
	
✓	Match employees who have common interests. Developing relation­
ships at work is easier when common ground exists.
	
✓	Pair employees according to the type of intelligence they share. 
(Chapter 7 outlines multiple intelligences.) Those with the same intel­
ligence strengths may approach issues similarly and be able to share 
ideas in a format that is easy for the other to understand.
	
One corporation used a speed dating approach to match mentors and men­
tees. Each mentee spent ten minutes talking to a mentor, and then a bell rang 
and the mentees moved on to the next mentor. The group actually thought 
this was quite fun and released a lot of tension. After all the “dates” were 
done, employees and mentors asked to selected three people with whom they 
felt they could work. In many cases, the selections matched and the program 
began. Those few who had no exact matches tried a few more “dates,” and 
eventually everyone was partnered up.
After the matches are made, your mentor/mentee pairs may spend time 
together in informal settings like lunch or coffee dates, or you may want to 
set up mentoring meetings in which all pairs get together to share experi­
ences, build relationships, and improve the program through suggestions 
and comments.
Coaching or mentoring doesn’t work without clear expectations for all stake­
holders. Someone may be wonderful at his job but unable to explain exactly 
what he does to someone else. Your coaches or mentors may need to be 
coached themselves!
You must be certain that your coaches are prepared to coach. First and fore­
most, your coaches or mentors must have emotional self control and empa­
thy. Their job is to build rapport with a potentially valuable member of your 
team — someone who someday may be a leader in your organization.

73
 Chapter 4: Leaders Are Made, Not Born
Sharing Your Vision
Sometimes you look at your business as a whole — the big picture. Your right 
hemisphere dominates your thoughts, and the business becomes a living, 
breathing organism. All of the parts work together to make the whole — to 
meet the requirements of your vision, your dream.
At other times, you may see what your left hemisphere sees: the details. The 
individual cogs in the wheel. When you see these pieces and parts, you can 
see each employee and each job description that makes up the guts of the 
business.
Employees usually are focused on the left-hemisphere vision: They’re stuck 
in their individual cubicles, sections, or teams unable to see where their part 
fits into the whole. Often every one of us gets so caught up in the nuances of 
our own responsibility that it’s difficult to see beyond that. When employees 
get mired in details, your job is to bring them back to the big picture.
Your vision statement may use words, but it needs to inspire through story, 
metaphor, or even song, and it must be believable and achievable to the 
stakeholders you share it with.
You start with the future. Where do you want to go? How long will it take you 
to get there? You don’t have to outline yet how you will get there. In fact, the 
people you share your vision with may have a great part in the design of the 
process.
Look at Microsoft’s vision statement. In earlier days it was “A PC on every 
desk and in every home.” But mission statements and vision statements 
change with the times. Today their statement is to “help people and busi­
nesses throughout the world reach their full potential.” Their recent state­
ment is a bit more abstract than their initial vision. You can visualize a PC on 
every desk, but it’s a little more difficult to get a concrete picture of potential. 
However, both statements are inspiring and emotional. Therefore they are 
easier to get across.
When organizing your vision statement, ask the important questions:
	
✓	Who is going to do this?
	
✓	What are you going to do?
	
✓	Where is it going to happen?
	
✓	When will the action take place?

It looks like you will write a newspaper article, but these are the questions 
that need to be addressed in a vision statement. Save the how for your mis­
sion statement. The stakeholders you share your vision statement with may 
be helpful in constructing and streamlining your mission statement.
Probably one of the most emotional and dynamic vision statements comes 
from the famous I have a dream speech by Martin Luther King, Jr. His vision 
was easy to picture and carry in your mind with statements like, “I have a 
dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves 
and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the 
table of brotherhood.” And his repetition of the statement, “I have a dream” 
in a voice that carried confidence, passion, and compassion made it easy to 
remember.
What is your dream? As a leader, you need to share your vision. King could 
have shared his statements with pure fact and no emotion, but the result just 
wouldn’t have been the same.
	
If you’re passionate about your leadership vision, share it with every 
employee, every stakeholder, and anyone who will listen. Make it visible 
throughout your organization, your offices, and your building:
	
✓	Include it at the top or bottom of each e-mail or memo.
	
✓	Hang a framed copy in the reception area.
	
✓	Post it in every cubicle or office.
	
✓	Include it on your letterhead.
	
✓	Make it part of your logo.
	
✓	Heck, hang that sucker in the restrooms.

Linking Leadership and the Brain
In This Chapter
▶	Examining the brain of a leader
▶	Recognizing failed leadership practices
▶	Giving employees’ brains what they need
▶	Linking your brain to their brains
N
ot too long ago, leaders were chosen for their IQ scores, grade point 
averages, and general knowledge of business. But the times, they are 
a-changin’. Many board chairmen were surprised to find out that the exem­
plary student with a high intelligence quotient wasn’t quite cutting it. The then-
typical leader (whom you find in many corporations today), was a business 
person rather than a people person. When psychologists and neuroscientists 
began looking at the brain, the job description of leader began to change.
In today’s successful companies, leaders are doing more than using their 
heads; they’re using their brains. The cognitive skills that helped them 
remember business law and technical knowledge were hard at work. But 
their people skills were lacking. You can become a stronger leader by under­
standing your own brain. You can then use that information to guide your 
leadership role and your entire organization. You can offer employees stimu­
lating opportunities, or you can keep them in a rut. You have the power.
In this chapter, you find out about the ideal leader’s brain, how to work with 
different brains, and how to attract the best brains. Great leaders bring out the 
full potential of those they lead by working with the brain instead of against it.
Glimpsing the Ideal Leader’s Brain
Great leaders have good heads on their shoulders. (You can quote me on 
that.) The effective leader of today has the opportunity to have a solid under­
standing of how the brain works and can recognize where his thoughts and 
behaviors are coming from. This leader influences how his own brain works 
from acknowledging what he’s paying attention to, what his emotional brain 
is up to, and how well his thinking brain is, well, thinking!

Getting your RAS in gear
The reticular activating system (RAS; I describe it in Chapter 2) is the portal 
through which nearly all information enters the brain. (Smells are the excep­
tion; they go directly into your brain’s emotional area.) The RAS filters the 
incoming information and affects what you pay attention to, how aroused you 
are, and what is not going to get access to all three pounds of your brain.
For survival’s sake, your RAS responds to your name, anything that threatens 
your survival, and information that you need immediately. For instance, if 
you’re looking for a file that you’re sure you placed on your desk, your RAS 
alerts your brain to search for the name of the file — Andrews vs. State of 
Illinois, say — or focus on one word in the file name to help you find it.
The RAS also responds to novelty. You notice anything new and different. For 
leadership purposes, this includes anything out of the ordinary in day-to-day 
activities within your organization, attending to changes in your employees 
relative to production, mood, and interactions with others.
	
Your RAS is a great leadership tool. It is your radar detector. As long as you 
don’t bog it down with your own personal issues, it will work for you. Program 
your thoughts each morning by doing the following:
	
✓	Take care of your personal issues. If you’re concerned about your 
child’s behavior, for example, devise a plan to deal with it. Make sure 
your plan includes an appropriate time that you can put your plan into 
action. And then put the issue on the back burner until you can act on it.
I know it! I’ll think of it! Give me a minute!
How many times have you had that “tip of 
the tongue” experience? You know the one. 
Someone asks the name of the actor who was 
in that movie with Nicole Kidman. They were in 
Australia and life was really hard. You know, 
don’t you? And yet you can’t think of it; neither 
can your friend. You asked your brain to retrieve 
information, and it cannot. Usually this is a case 
where your working memory is so busy that 
your brain has no time or space for retrieval of 
the tidbit you want. Later, when your working 
memory is less busy, the answer simply pops 
into your head. You may also run across the 
name of that actor in another film or in an arti­
cle that you’re reading. Your brain says, “Aha! 
I’ve got the answer.” Your brain notes the name 
because you programmed your RAS to attend to 
this information when it became available.

77
 Chapter 5: Linking Leadership and the Brain
	
✓	Read over your long-term goals. Make sure they’re still pertinent to 
your vision. Change, delete, or add goals as necessary.
	
✓	Read or create your short-term goals. Determine the timeline for each. 
Change them according to current needs, trends, and modifications in 
your mission or vision.
	
	Make sure that the last list you look at is your list of short-term 
goals; your RAS helps you keep them in mind. Even when you don’t 
realize you’re thinking about these goals, your brain knows that 
they’re important and makes note of anything that might relate to 
them.
Leading with your limbic system
The best leaders incorporate the emotional intelligence skills that I outline 
in Chapter 8. Your limbic system houses your amygdala, the almond-shaped 
primitive emotional structure that can run your life and your organization. 
(Chapter 2 tells you more about the brain’s structure.) Whether you will be 
the master of your limbic brain or its slave is the first decision you need to 
make as a leader.
Should you become the slave of the limbic system and the emotions it gen­
erates, you may see one of two scenarios. Limbic denial occurs when you 
ignore your own and others’ emotions, and limbic overflow comes about 
when you can’t ignore or control any of your own emotions. Table 5-1 com­
pares the two.
Should you choose to master the competencies of leadership — that 
is, build your emotional intelligence as described in Chapter 8 — your 
situation changes dramatically. As a leader who has the ability to control 
her emotions and handle the emotions of others, you begin to lead more 
through managing relationships, empathizing with employees, and using 
emotion to guide your decisions. I call this limbic leadership, because it 
draws on the emotional skills of self-confidence, emotional self-management, 
empathy, and feedback.
You likely create an environment where employees feel safe to share their 
feelings. When you master your emotions, you see patterns similar to those 
in Table 5-2.

78
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
Table 5-1 	
Comparing Limbic Denial and Overflow
Limbic denial
Limbic overflow
Your decisions are based totally on hard 
data with no intuitive influence.
You really can’t make a decision; sometimes 
you feel very strongly that something should be 
done, and the next minute you don’t think it’s 
such a good idea.
You greet employees with a brusque 
hello and/or questions related to their 
job, customers, or hard data.
Your meetings with your team leaders are 
taken over by whichever one talks the loudest 
and has a lot to say. Your presence is all but 
ignored.
Your relationships with your subordi­
nates disintegrate because you don’t 
nurture relationships or put their needs 
above yours.
Those who report directly to you don’t look 
forward to meeting with you as you tend to not 
give any specifics. You’re not sure they are 
heading in the right direction, so you continually 
have them change their approaches.
Your clients either choose to speak with 
one of your subordinates rather than you, 
or your customers find another company 
to do business with where they can find 
compassion and empathy.
Organizational meetings that include all 
employees are a joke. You are like a bad 
seventh-grade teacher spending all of your time 
trying to gain control. No one respects your 
authority.
You are a hard-nosed son of a gun who 
cares little for other’s feelings and can’t 
build any new relationships. If your busi­
ness is successful, leadership responsi­
bilities have been taken on by top-level 
executives who appear to care about 
others.
You spend so much time trying to make up your 
mind that you have little time for anything else.
Within the limbic system, the hippocampus is located next to the amyg­
dala. The hippocampus helps you form long-term memories and responds 
to incoming information by checking for a pattern that has been previously 
stored. Seeking a pattern and not finding it is a surprise to the hippocampus 
and calls for special attention to the situation.
Because of the proximity of the amygdala and the hippocampus, emotional 
information is easy to remember. When you control and use your emotions, 
you also provide a greater opportunity for long-term memory storage. Your 
emotions don’t get in the way.
Flip the emotion coin and you find a different approach to emotion and 
memory. Add some emotion to the information you want to share and have 
remembered, and you get a stronger memory. (But watch out for too much 
emotion, which can cloud the memory process.)

Table 5-2	
Benefits of Limbic Leadership
Master of self-awareness
Master of handling others
Your decisions are based on emotional and 
cognitive information.
You consider the emotional needs of 
employees, clients, and customers.
You excuse yourself from meetings when your 
emotional state is not helpful to the situation.
When emotions are strong, you offer 
your staff the opportunity to reflect and to 
vent in order for them and you to come to 
terms with their feelings.
You are aware of emotional contagion and 
shield yourself from negativity.
You use emotional contagion when you 
are feeling positive, passionate, and 
excited about work-related issues. You 
“spread the news.”
You work your own feelings into planning and 
responding to others. Individuals with whom 
you interact know that you’re a feeling, caring 
person.
You consider other’s feelings when 
making decisions and work your under­
standing of those feelings into your 
responses.
You “roll with the punches” when it comes to 
changes within your organization and between 
your organization and others. You control and 
use your feelings so you are flexible.
You work with others to adjust to change. 
You help others understand their feelings 
and encourage them toward change and 
flexibility.
Promoting your frontal lobes: 
The brain’s CEO
The frontal lobes are sometimes referred to as the brain’s CEO. All executive 
decision-making takes place in this area of the brain. It works most efficiently 
when information is not waylaid by other structures. As the emotional system 
filters incoming information, it either passes it along to the CEO, or if the infor­
mation is alarming, delays information processing. Blocking information may 
mean that your brain is in survival mode and the information will be sent to the 
automatic, reflexive brain, where you react without rational thought.
Frontal lobes do the following for leaders:
	
✓	Help identify goals
	
✓	Plan to reach goals
	
✓	Organize time and manpower to follow the plan
	
✓	Project future consequences of poor implementation
	
✓	Project future results of proper implementation

Bright lights, big mistake: 
When emotions steal the show
Chuck finds out about interfering emotions the 
hard way. He sends a top technician, Justin, to 
Las Vegas for a training of trainers session for 
a new product that Chuck’s company plans to 
carry. His plan is that Justin can return to the 
company after the training and pass on his 
knowledge of the new product line to the rest 
of the employees.
Justin has never been to Las Vegas, and so is 
very excited. He arrives on Sunday for the two-
day training. That evening he gets a phone call 
from his mother that his father has had a mild 
heart attack. She reassures Justin that Dad is 
doing well. He is sitting up in bed joking with 
the nurses. Although Justin is relieved that his 
father is okay, he can’t stop thinking about the 
fact that he wasn’t there to see him or support 
his mother. When the training begins the next 
morning, Justin tries to concentrate on the new 
product, but everything reminds him of his dad. 
For one thing, the trainer is an older guy who 
is balding just like his dad. Justin continually 
refocuses on the training and finally gets into 
the flow of things. At the end of the first training 
day, he feels like he has a pretty good under­
standing of what’s going on.
Justin calls and speaks with his father that eve­
ning and feels reassured. When the next day’s 
training begins, Justin is completely focused 
and very optimistic about the new product and 
is getting a handle on how to train the rest of 
the company when he gets home. Mid-morning 
Justin’s cell phone rings. His sister, Julia, is 
calling to tell him that his dad had yet another 
heart attack. This one not as mild and the doc­
tors are going to perform open-heart surgery. 
Because Justin is returning home later in the 
day, Julia tells him not to worry. They won’t be 
starting the surgery until after Justin arrives.
The rest of the day, Justin can’t concentrate on 
any of the training. He can think only of his dad. 
He is sad that he is not with him. He tries to get 
an earlier flight and just leave the training, but no 
flights are available. So he stays at the training, 
but his emotions overwhelm him and even though 
the trainer is doing a great job, Justin can’t get 
himself to absorb any of the information.
Chuck is, of course, sympathetic about Justin’s 
problems, but he has spent a lot of money for 
the training that was unsuccessful. Justin’s 
emotions were out of his control, and although 
he tried to control them, his fear and concern 
for his father were more than he could handle.

81
 Chapter 5: Linking Leadership and the Brain
The frontal lobes work with the insula, a structure deep within the brain. This 
piece of brain geography is aware of all of your physical responses. In other 
words, that feeling in the pit of your stomach when you know you’ve said 
something you shouldn’t have or forgotten an important event comes from 
the insula. The insula helps you decide whether to head to the refrigerator 
when you’re hungry. It’s involved with social interactions, guilt, and lust. The 
insula interacts with the frontal lobe to respond to those gut feelings.
The ability of your insula to translate your unconscious emotions into con­
scious feelings provides you with information to help you make a decision. 
Attending to your feelings assists the CEO of your brain in problem-solving 
and decision-making. For example, you have to decide which manager should 
take over some newly acquired territory. Hank has the smallest territory of 
all of the managers, but every time you consider him, you find a reason to 
pass him over. Something about Hank bothers you. In fact, you get irritated 
when you look at his name on the list. This irritation comes from your insula 
and relates to a previous experience in which Hank neglected someone in his 
territory, and you had to soothe the disgruntled customer. Even though it 
happened long ago, it affects whether you give Hank more customers.
You combine the information from your insula with the data you have on 
your managers to help you make a decision. Deciding whether to trust Hank 
with a larger territory depends on your feelings as well as his recent sales 
record. If his sales are low, you go with your feeling to not expand his sales 
territory; however, if he’s producing, you may find yourself giving him the 
opportunity to try out the larger territory. As a leader, regarding your feel­
ings can help you make better decisions.
Examining the Leader from Hell
An old and jokey bit of wisdom advises that if you can’t be a good example 
you should at least serve as a terrible warning. In this section you find the 
terrible warning — the problems that can be created when the leader’s brain 
is not functioning well. Everything you say and do is a result of your emo­
tional and cognitive responses to the current situation. Not taking care of 
your brain can put you in a leadership category that you want to avoid. You 
don’t want to ruin the relationships you have. 
Prefrontal cortex in overdrive
The prefrontal cortex has needs. Rest is one of them. It needs some quiet 
time. The brain is never completely at rest, but when any area of the brain is 
overworked, important brain chemicals are depleted. As a result, you have 
trouble focusing, creating, and controlling the emotional center in the brain. 

82
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
In other words, some of your impulse control vanishes if you overwork your 
prefrontal cortex.
Overworking the prefrontal cortex may give you an overall feeling that some­
thing is wrong. You may feel anxious and unable to focus and make good 
decisions. In this state of stress, lower levels of the brain may take over and 
cause you to fall back on old habits that are familiar to you. This shift in the 
brain appears to be a defense mechanism or an attempt at survival.
When your prefrontal cortex is overworked, you make decisions without 
using your brain’s executive functions. For example, maybe you have worked 
to become a better listener, to communicate clearly and in a kind way, and 
you take others’ emotions into consideration when making decisions. But 
18-hour workdays, eating on the run, and inadequate sleep take a toll on your 
body and raise your stress levels. When a project fails, you forget all of 
your training and begin yelling at your subordinates, refusing to listen to 
their concerns, and alienating everyone in the company. Your overstressed, 
overworked prefrontal cortex can’t control your impulses, and as a result 
you revert to old, bad habits. You have, indeed, become the leader from hell.
A prefrontal cortex without rest may become obsessed with a need to control 
and even punish. If you become the leader who needs to micromanage, you may 
have an overactive prefrontal cortex to blame. Worry and anxiety may be caus­
ing your behavior. Follow the advice for taking care of your brain in Chapter 17.
Prefrontal cortex stalls
An underactive prefrontal cortex often leads to attention difficulty. Attention 
deficit disorder probably arises from underactivity of the prefrontal cortex 
and its lowered ability to use or access the chemical dopamine, which helps 
calm other brain areas and enables the brain to focus on one thing at a time.
Someone with an underactive prefrontal cortex may notice a decreased abil­
ity to express himself or his emotions, which may lead to problems in all 
areas of life. Shortened attention span, distractibility, disorganization, poor 
judgment, and short-term-memory problems may result.
A prefrontal cortex that shows little activity has also been associated with 
some forms of depression. If your prefrontal cortex can’t communicate well 
with the rest of your brain, incoming messages are examined only on an 
emotional level. If you have just heard that the chairman of the board wants 
to meet with you, for example, and you think that means you’re going to lose 
your job, you may dwell on this idea. Given the opportunity, your prefrontal 
cortex would look at the meeting request from many logical angles — per­
haps you’re being considered for a bigger position or are being commended 
on a job well done. But because these rational thoughts aren’t at your dis­
posal, you remain entrenched in the negative.

83
 Chapter 5: Linking Leadership and the Brain
A person with an underactive prefrontal cortex may behave immaturely. 
When the executive functions are not actively involved in decision-making, 
poor judgment often results. This leader may get into sexual harassment 
trouble because he is acting or speaking inappropriately or may even cheat 
on a business deal.
	
To keep your prefrontal cortex active, do interesting and exciting things in 
your life and at work. If you find yourself unfocused or feeling depressed, 
choose a part of your work that you really like and concentrate on just that for 
a while. Get others, like those on your senior team, to take care of the more 
mundane work until you feel better and your behavior changes.
Staying ahead by using his head
Jay has his brain linked to his leadership posi­
tion. He is an entrepreneur with several busi­
nesses under his ownership and leadership. In 
enterprises from alcohol to art, he must mas­
terfully lead many kinds of people. Now in his 
fifties, Jay began the pattern of working with 
his RAS at the beginning of each day long ago.
Jay organizes his personal life and deals first 
with the most important people in his world, his 
family. Each morning in his office he reaches 
for legal pads with his goals on them. Every day 
for each of his businesses he looks first at his 
long-term goals and then his short-term goals.
Jay rarely changes his long-term goals, but he 
might change his short-term goals in response 
to the economy, production, new employees, 
and any other factors that could change his 
way of doing business. Jay continues his day 
with his brain primed for those short-term goals. 
He has meetings with his managers throughout 
the day — in person and by video conference. 
He begins each meeting with some personal 
conversations. Keeping up with the families 
and activities of his managers is a priority for 
Jay. He likes to keep up to the minute, and so 
his recommendations, requests, and questions 
take into consideration the emotional states 
of the people he has put in charge to keep his 
businesses productive and profitable.
Each of these conferences includes discussion 
of problems and next steps. Jay knows that he 
needs his people for future planning and prob­
lem solving. He makes sure that he considers 
all suggestions from his subordinates; they’re 
free to share any problems and concerns, and 
to disagree with Jay without feeling their jobs 
are in jeopardy. Jay physically makes appear­
ances at each site monthly.
As a CEO, Jay uses the CEO of his brain — his 
frontal lobes. He has trained his brain to be 
aware of what is important to keep his busi­
nesses running smoothly. He is aware of his 
own feelings and the feelings of his employees, 
and he uses the information to create and keep 
good relationships. As a result of his brain’s 
ability to stay on task and keep his emotions 
in check, he utilizes the executive functions of 
his brain with ease. He focuses on the future, 
reaches his goals, and keeps his employees 
happy.

Faulty emotional thermostat
A good leader takes the emotional temperature of the organization on a 
regular basis. But sometimes leaders are clueless: They may have thermo­
stats that don’t work or not even know there’s a thermostat! The leader from 
hell may let her emotions run the organization and disregard the feelings of 
others, or she may have a faulty connection between her emotional brain and 
her logical brain that causes her to run the business in an unfeeling, simply 
logical manner.
If you can’t take your own emotional temperature, you’ll have trouble deter­
mining whether things are heating up at work. If the leader’s thermostat’s 
broken you might experience the following: 
	
✓	Mood changes
	
✓	Negativity
	
✓	No respect for others
	
✓	A “winning is everything” attitude
Gage in a rage: A tale of prefrontal lobe damage
”Gage in a rage” sounds like a Dr. Seuss book, 
but it refers to the story of Phineas Gage, whose 
prefrontal lobe damage changed his personality 
and his ability to lead. Phineas was a railroad 
worker in the in Vermont. He was foreman of a 
group that used explosives to remove debris so 
track could be laid. Coworkers described him 
as a likeable man who worked well with his 
peers and did a fine job of overseeing the work 
that was so important to the railroad.
One day in 1848, however, Gage suffered a ter­
rible accident. An unintended blast sent an iron 
rod up through Gage’s left cheekbone and out 
through the middle of his forehead.
Amazingly enough, Gage stood up after the 
blast and spoke to his workers, who immedi­
ately loaded him on a cart and took him to a 
doctor. After several months of recuperation, 
Phineas went back to work. His personality, 
however, had changed dramatically. From the 
popular foreman with a head (no pun intended) 
for business, a good friend, and a loveable char­
acter, Gage became nasty, obstinate, fitful, and 
profane. He made inappropriate remarks and 
sexual gestures. He was fired, and eventually 
his wife left him. He lived another 12 years.
Decades later his body was exhumed as doc­
tors realized that his story held valuable infor­
mation about the brain and personality. The 
damage to his frontal lobes changed him and 
his ability to deal with his emotions and with 
others, and it certainly damaged his leadership 
ability.

✓	Failure to share or exhibit good values
	
✓	Taking things personally
	
✓	Inability to acknowledge others’ feelings
To adjust your emotional thermostat, try the following:
	
✓	Be vigilant. Observe your feelings as they creep up, but don’t necessarily 
act on them.
	
✓	Take note of employees’ and customers’ responses to you.
	
✓	Make yourself take the time to listen to others, no matter how difficult 
that seems.
	
✓	Exercise.
	
✓	Eat high-protein foods to increase neurotransmitters like serotonin.
	
The brain’s emotional center has many more pathways to the prefrontal 
cortex than the prefrontal cortex has to the emotional center, which means 
that you feel faster than you think. The executive brain evolved from the emo­
tional brain, and the emotional brain is designed to keep you from danger. 
Lions and tigers and bears taught the amygdala to respond by running, but 
unfairness is a more likely threat today, and our primitive brain needs the 
executive to ponder situations such as fairness or jealousy or the many other 
situations facing leaders today.
Basal ganglia bottoms out
Basal ganglia refers to several structures located deep in the brain. Still being 
studied, the basal ganglia are responsible for helping you perform simple 
procedures. In contact with the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia can help 
you change by storing new messages that may become new habits. That’s all 
well and good. But the basal ganglia sometimes seem to have a mind of its 
own. Because basal ganglia store our habits and habits are hard to break, you 
may follow old leadership habits, especially in times of stress. What worked 
in the past doesn’t necessarily work today. And if you have gone out of your 
way to provide safety, security, and predictability for your workforce, a sur­
prising change can cause distress and loss of productivity.
	
The most promising way to avoid falling back on old habits is to be sure that 
your new habits are properly ingrained in your brain — practice, practice, and 
more practice. If you understand why the new habits are helpful and feel the 
importance of creating a successful atmosphere, you’re much more likely to 
change.

Meeting the Brain’s Needs
Chapter 3 details several of the brain’s requirements — basics that the brain 
needs in all environments. As a leader, how do you encourage employees to 
meet these needs in their own brains? You need to know what makes those 
brains get up in the morning and want to come to work for you. The following 
sections outline some ways you can make that happen.
Predictability
Because all information enters the brain through the brain stem, and the 
brain stem is in charge of survival, your employees must feel physically and 
emotionally safe. Providing predictability for them helps them meet this 
need.
	
A predictable atmosphere and a schedule help the brain relax and feel free to 
use higher level thinking to get the job done. Knowing what you need to do 
frees working memory for imagination and creativity.
You need organizational and planning skills to create a predictable work envi­
ronment. Subordinates need to know the plan or the agenda. They need to 
know your vision and the goal of the organization. They need clear targets.
Challenge
Brains explore, test, and challenge. Adult brains can change and grow and 
make new connections. The brain is born wanting to learn. By providing chal­
lenging experiences to your employees, you help keep their brains active and 
young.
How does challenge fit in with predictability? Very well, actually. When the 
brain can count on the framework of its environment, it’s primed for challenge.
Make sure that any challenge you issue is appropriate for the worker’s expe­
rience and education. For instance, if all John has ever done for you is work 
on the assembly line, you wouldn’t throw him into a position in research and 
development. At least, not without coaching.
And appropriate challenge is key. Challenge should be just a level above the 
brain’s comfort level. Taking someone out of her comfort zone is great, as 
long as she knows what is expected of her and coached through the new or 
more challenging experience.

 Chapter 5: Linking Leadership and the Brain
You can provide challenge for your workers in endless ways. The following is 
a list of suggestions:
	
✓	In small groups or in their teams, ask employees to come up with a 
better way to accomplish this or that task.
	
✓	Ask an employee to cover for another worker doing a job that is slightly 
different.
	
✓	Ask employees to think of ways to improve their current duties.
	
✓	Challenge your teams to increase production in a certain area in a speci­
fied amount of time, but make it low stress.
	
✓	Challenge your employees to think of a problem at work, and to come up 
with the solution.
	
✓	Challenge your employees to have conversations about issues at work 
and include conflict in those conversations.
Through challenge your employees become energized. If you challenge them 
and train them, the learning opportunities may help you retain them. The 
brain prefers to be challenged!
Feedback
Imaging of the brain reveals that areas associated with motivation show more 
activity when someone is learning a task and receiving feedback compared to 
others not receiving feedback but learning the same task. Feedback feeds the 
brain. Just as it needs blood, oxygen, and nutrients, the brain needs to learn 
and receive comments about how it’s doing. (Chapter 3 tells you more about 
the brain’s love affair with feedback.)
	
As a leader who provides your employees with what they need, choosing how 
you give and receive feedback is essential.
Lack of feedback can actually cause the brain to be stressed. Studies have 
shown that negative feedback may be less stressful to the brain than no feed­
back at all.
Some of today’s young people are satisfied with yearly reviews. Some of the 
largest companies give feedback only when it is requested. Interviewing some 
employees from these companies shows that they didn’t seem concerned. 
They figured as long as they were doing a good job, it didn’t really matter 
if they had formal feedback on a regular basis. But they are getting a lot of 
informal feedback. “No news is good news,” and so employees may interpret 
not getting negative feedback as a message that they’re doing well.

88
Part I: Leadership Is All in Your Head 
	
Memos, e-mails, and text messages are not good ways to give and receive feed­
back. Print or digital messages are easily misinterpreted. (Chapter 15 talks fur­
ther about communication.) Face-to-face feedback is best.
Feed employees’ brains by trying some of the following:
	
✓	Be specific and timely. When you match the message to the event and 
deliver it on time, information reaches the prefrontal cortex, where new 
ways of getting things done can be generated. Take care of problems 
when they occur. Doing so prevents employees from getting habits 
formed that are incorrect.
	
✓	Connect your feedback to company goals. Make your employee feel that her 
contributions are valued and create a positive emotion with the feedback.
	
✓	Set up a schedule for follow-up conversations.
	
✓	Put your message in writing as well as delivering it verbally. Graphics 
have impact.
	
✓	Build on employees’ strengths when giving negative feedback. By 
beginning with the strengths, you involve the prefrontal cortex right 
away. If you begin with negativity, the information may never reach the 
frontal lobe; it may get stuck in the primitive emotional areas and put the 
employee in survival mode. Always give suggestions for improvement.
	
✓	Feedback is a two-way street. Ask for feedback from your employees on 
your own performance and on company policies.
Connecting feedback and stress
At a biochemical lab, three teams worked on a 
faster way to determine water quality for resi­
dents living on small lakes in a Midwestern state. 
After the teams worked for a week on the proj­
ect, the administrator came around to see how 
things were progressing. He walked around the 
lab observing each team at work. He stopped 
at Team 1’s work table and told them that he 
believed they were headed in the right direc­
tion and to keep up the good work. Team 2 was 
having some disagreements. The administrator 
stopped and told them that they weren’t quite on 
the right track. He thought Team 2 was working 
on a test too similar to ones they already had 
and would end up nowhere if they didn’t change 
their focus. He didn’t say a word to Team 3. He 
stopped and looked, and then left the room.
If the stress levels of these three teams had 
been tested after this visit, the results would 
have been very interesting. According to some 
studies, Team 1’s levels of stress hormones 
would be quite low. Good neurotransmitters 
would have been released in their brains from 
the positive feedback. Team 2’s stress levels 
would be high. After all, they had to go back to 
the drawing board and find another approach 
to their work. But Team 3’s stress levels would 
be highest of all. They hadn’t received any feed­
back and had been treated as though they didn’t 
really exist. No one deserves to feel extinct.

 Chapter 5: Linking Leadership and the Brain
Creating a Brain-to-Brain Link
Understanding where your employees are coming from — which areas of their 
brains are active when you communicate with them — will make your relation­
ships stronger. This brain-to-brain link is the ultimate way to build rapport, 
express empathy, and increase confidence in you and your company.
When your prefrontal cortex is working well, you can use your RAS, your 
emotional brain (amygdala), and your higher-level thinking and decision-
making skills in every endeavor. With this high-performing leadership brain, 
you can link yourself to other brains. You understand whether you’re com­
municating with an employee or customer who is operating from her survival 
brain, her emotional brain, or her executive brain, and then you can meet her 
at that level, and help her utilize higher levels.
Imagine, for example, that you have a meeting set up with an employee who 
isn’t meeting his portion of the goals for the team. He will probably be in sur­
vival mode. The employee’s RAS isn’t going to be responsive to your detailed 
dialogue.
To figure out his mind state, take some time to observe actions and reactions 
before you start a dialogue. You may clearly see anger, frustration, sadness, 
or fear on his face. His mode may also show up in his words, tone, and ges­
tures. Harsh movements or even gloominess can be signs that he’s in survival 
mode.
What do you do? In the survival mode everything is about the “I” in the 
person, not about the “we” in the organization. Begin by reaching out to 
that “I.” Instead of beginning with the factual information in your executive 
brain, first ask how he’s feeling. Present the problem from his perspective. 
For example, “John, I’m sure you aren’t happy about not meeting your goals. 
What can I do to help you?” This approach takes away some of the threat 
that he feels. He can reach up to the emotional part of his brain and begin 
to tell you how he feels. You’ve linked to his brain and already he is moving 
closer to executive function.
After he explains how he feels and what he thinks is causing those feelings, 
ask him what he thinks he can do about it. Now you’re considering those feel­
ings in his emotional brain. He feels like you understand him. Asking him for 
suggestions accesses his executive functions. He can explore what he’s done 
before and he can create a new procedure.
	
Relaxing the emotional brain and letting an employee feel that he is not alone 
enables him to involve his executive brain, which begins to suppress the 
emotions and think logically about the situation. When he meets you on your 
executive level where solutions to the problem lie, you can lead him toward 
making wise choices and solving his problem and yours.

Helping an employee move out of survival mode
Linda owns her own real estate company. She 
has a total of 50 people working for her, includ­
ing — 30 realtors and 20 assistants and sup­
port-staff members. Linda receives hard data 
on listings, sales, rentals, and showings each 
day. When sales are down because of the 
economy, construction, or school crises, she 
makes sure to speak with each of her agents 
to determine whether they’re stuck in survival 
mode. When Linda approaches Richard, one of 
her top agents, she finds him preoccupied. 
“How’s it going, Rich?” she asks. “Just fine, 
Linda. But I’m really busy,” he says as he tries 
to blow her off.
Linda sees from his tone of voice and attempt 
to avoid her that Rich is in survival mode. He 
hasn’t made any sales in two months, he has 
a daughter going away to college soon, and he 
recently bought an expensive car to impress his 
clients.
“Oh, I’ll just keep you a minute,” Linda says. “I 
had a couple of calls this week from former cli­
ents. I think they’re looking for something in the 
new developments on the outskirts of town.”
With this Rich directs his attention to her, but 
he’s a little cautious. Linda continues: “Well, I 
don’t have the time or the energy for these cli­
ents right now. I’m working on the merger with 
Blew Realty, and I have my hands full. Do you 
think you could show these people around?”
Rich smiles and nods. Linda can see his stress 
levels lower as he relaxes in his chair. “Can you 
e-mail me their information? I’ll squeeze them 
into my schedule.”
This smart leader knows that her best agent is 
in a rough spot. By checking with him and rec­
ognizing his fight-or-flight response, she saw 
that he needed her help. By offering him a few 
of her clients, she changed his emotional state. 
She used the planning and empathy skills of her 
prefrontal cortex and her limbic system to move 
him out of survival mode. He could now use his 
emotional skills and organizational skills to do a 
good job for both of them.

You Want to Be
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding leadership styles
▶	Assessing your leadership style
▶	Knowing when to lead differently
S
o, you want to be a leader. Or you are already a leader. Do you know what 
kind of leadership style you’re using? Perhaps you have worked for lead­
ers with different styles and you know what kind of leader you don’t want to be.
Some leaders find their style and stick with it no matter what, but different 
situations may call for different leadership styles. You may find yourself in a 
leadership position that calls for one approach, but as the business changes 
or new employees come on board, you might adopt a different style.
In this chapter, you find out about different leadership styles. I include a tool 
for assessing your leadership style and show you how changing styles may 
make sense to you and your brain.
Running Down Classic Leadership Styles
The most common leadership styles — authoritarian, democratic, and deleg­
ative — refer to the types of decision-making that commonly go on in an orga­
nization. The upcoming sections give you details about each of these styles.
Authoritarian
Authoritarian leaders know exactly what they want done, who is to do it, and 
when it should be completed. Although these leaders don’t offer much wiggle 
room, they often get the job done, and they make their expectations obvious.

94
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Many authoritarian leaders
	
✓	Fail to seek questions or comments
	
✓	Make decisions with little or no input from employees
	
✓	Are characterized as bossy and compared to dictators
If you’re the leader of a small organization and your employees are untrained 
and need a lot of management as well as leadership, you may need to adopt 
this style to get things done.
Some employees thrive under authoritarian leadership. The traditionalist 
generation (probably the oldest group of workers you have; I talk more about 
them in Chapter 15), has few problems with this leadership style; employ­
ees from that era respect authority and don’t question decisions made by 
bosses, supervisors, managers, or leaders. The younger generations, those 
employees in their mid-30s or younger, don’t easily offer their respect to 
authority figures until those figures have proven themselves, therefore they 
don’t do well under the authoritarian style. Older baby boomers may like this 
style but younger ones often prefer more input into decision-making.
	
The authoritarian style can elicit a stress response in employees’ brains. If 
employees feel they’re constantly being watched, aren’t trusted, and have no 
control over their lives, stress hormones may be circulating in their brains 
and bodies. Chronic stress can interfere with work and with higher cognitive 
functions. Health problems may occur as a result of chronic stress, as well. 
The employee who isn’t comfortable with authoritarian leadership may feel 
he has to leave his job to protect himself. Chapter 2 tells you more about the 
stress response.
Democratic
The democratic style is also called participatory leadership and encourages 
employees and stakeholders to participate in decision-making. With an expe­
rienced workforce, the democratic style can be a positive experience for all 
stakeholders. Because everyone is included in making decisions, the decision 
makers need to be knowledgeable about the business, the process, the prod­
uct, and the vision statement.
In general, participatory leadership requires more time to get things done. 
Because a democratic leader intends to honor the thoughts, feelings, and 
needs of the employees, discussions may be lengthy. (And the larger the 
group, the longer the discussion may continue.) If the employees need more 
information to make their comments and assist with decisions, the process 
takes even longer.

95
 Chapter 6: Becoming the Leader You Want to Be
The democratic leader usually has motivated and inspired workers, and more 
motivation means more work gets done. When problems need to be solved, 
employees are encouraged to help and often have excellent suggestions. All 
employees are kept up to date with the inner workings and outer interactions 
of the business.
	
The democratic leadership style is great for those brains that need to have 
input and a feeling of control. When someone is listened to and understood, 
the brain releases feel-good neurotransmitters. This reaction contributes to 
motivation, focus, and attention, and it increases the brain’s ability to think on 
a higher cognitive level.
Who’s the boss?
When Maya accepted the job as department 
head for the small research section of the phar­
maceutical lab, she was excited. As head of the 
department she assumed she would have a lot 
of say over the research projects, how funds 
would be allocated, and which employees 
worked on each project. Although the president 
of the company had been a little scary, Maya 
assumed that because she wouldn’t be report­
ing directly to him that she had no worries. He 
seemed kind of strict, like her grandfather had 
been, but she loved grandpa and thought she 
might get used to this guy. She planned to stay 
with this job for one or two years, and then she 
would be off to California and hoped to have 
an online research position so she could stay 
home with her future children.
Maya had her speech prepared for the 
researchers she would be overseeing. She 
couldn’t wait to meet them and share her ideas 
as well as listen to theirs. When she entered 
the small research lab, she was shocked to 
see the president at the front of the room. All 
of the researchers walked into the lab quietly 
and sat before him. No one even glanced her 
way. Maya swallowed her surprise and walked 
straight to the front of the room.
“Good morning, Mr. Ross,” Maya said in her 
friendliest voice.
“Have a seat with the others, Miss Taylor,” Mr. 
Ross responded. He sort of smiled, but his eyes 
didn’t look happy.
Mr. Ross began, “People, I want to introduce 
you to your new department head, Miss Maya 
Taylor. She will be reporting directly to me. 
Nothing will change here. Your current projects 
will remain the same with the same deadlines. 
I don’t want newcomers causing any kinks in 
the timeline that we have. Miss Taylor will be 
using the regular assessment tools and report 
forms. I assume she will have no trouble follow­
ing the format. It is too bad that Mr. Newcomer, 
your previous department head, left for another 
opportunity. He wrote excellent reports. You 
have a lot to live up to, Miss Taylor. That’s it, 
people. Get to work.”
With that, he placed several files in Maya’s 
hands and walked out. The researchers headed 
to their project tables without even a hello.
“Well,” Maya thought, “There go all my ideas. 
Either this guy loosens up or I’m out of here.”
Maya’s generation doesn’t show the loyalty 
to a company that older generations usually 
do. Therefore, Maya has no problem leaving a 
company if she feels she has no input. Let your 
interviewees know what style of leadership you 
use and tell them about your expectations of 
employee responsibility and behavior.

Delegative
Trust and confidence are hallmarks of the delegative leadership style, which 
is sometimes called laissez faire leadership because of its minimal interference 
I think I can, I think I can — or can I?
François is good at his job. He has the unique 
ability to match the seller of a small business 
with small business buyers in such a way that 
everyone leaves the deal happy. He just joined 
a new business brokerage firm that allows him 
total autonomy over his work. François works 
on commission of 12 percent per transaction. 
His boss offered him his first deal for the com­
pany, saying only, “Take care of this one. The 
seller is having some trouble with the buyer. 
Seller thinks his business is his baby and wants 
to find the right people to take it over. Handle it 
any way you want. Just get it done. With your 
reputation, I don’t expect to hear from you 
until the contracts are signed, sealed, and 
delivered.”
François smiled and thought this would all be 
a piece of cake. Every seller has trouble sepa­
rating from his business — especially the Baby 
Boomers who don’t really want to quit working 
but think it’s time to retire. François met with the 
seller that afternoon. Tom Kuntz and his wife, 
Jennifer, were interested in selling their stained 
glass business and moving to the Midwest to 
be closer to their children and grandchildren. 
They were sincere, motivated, and had thought 
they were ready to move on. Until now. François 
questioned them about their feelings about the 
current offer that was on the table from the 
buyer. They responded that the price was too 
low. The offer was only $5,000 less than the 
asking price! François had heard others talk 
about seller’s remorse where the sellers decide 
they can’t give up the family business, but he 
had never had the problem.
François excused himself and called his boss. 
“I think these people are experiencing seller’s 
remorse. What can I do?”
His boss bristled, “You handle it. That’s why I 
hired you. Are they using brinkmanship?”
François had no idea what brinkmanship was. 
“What do you mean?” he asked.
“You know, are they threatening to pull out? 
Are they raising the price?” his boss responded 
gruffly.
“I don’t think so,” François replied. “They seem 
like really nice folks.”
“Listen, kid, this is your job. Don’t blow this. 
These people want to sell. Remind them how 
much they want to sell!” With that, his boss 
hung up.
Somehow François convinced the Kuntzes to 
go through with the deal. They weren’t happy 
when they left. François wasn’t happy, either. 
He had never felt so out of control of a situation. 
And François’s boss was very, very unhappy. 
He had been disturbed in the middle of a busi­
ness deal. He couldn’t afford to have someone 
like François conducting his business. He was 
just too wet behind the ears. François went 
back to selling cars.
You may need to change your decision-making 
style in order to train and help out new employ­
ees. If François had truly been ready to make all 
of his own decisions and understood the busi­
ness completely, he wouldn’t have phoned his 
boss with a common problem in this business. 
Delegative leadership works well only if the 
staff is highly skilled.

97
 Chapter 6: Becoming the Leader You Want to Be
in employees’ efforts. Under a delegative leader, employees have free rein to 
make decisions and get their jobs done. This style works very well with an edu­
cated and experienced workforce.
Some employees love the freedom of this style and thrive as they themselves 
become leaders. Those who are good decision-makers and don’t require 
guidance benefit from this style. If you’re especially interested in molding 
leaders to use for other acquisitions or expanding your business, delegative 
leadership provides on-the-job training that works. It increases employees’ 
pride and motivation. (But those who are insecure, afraid of making mistakes, 
or have difficulty communicating with others have difficulty operating under 
this leadership style.)
Younger generations, who prefer to work on their own, find the delegative 
style especially appealing. These employees don’t require a lot of face time 
with colleagues, and so do well with digitally based work.
	
If you have employees who need more direction, the delegative style can 
cause stress. The uncertainty of getting the job done well and the lack of guid­
ance may be overwhelming. Even if employees who prefer direction are work­
ing in a team, the team members who are confident in their work may make 
those less confident feel inferior, which can cause chronic stress. The circum­
stances for delegative leadership may be limited to situations in which every 
employee is well-versed in her role, feels in control of the situation, and loves 
her work.
Assessing Your Leadership Style
Chances are good that you have more than one style of leading. That’s not 
unusual. Most people copy traits from others and combine styles. Under 
certain circumstances you may have to change styles. As long as you don’t 
compromise your values or let the change affect your vision or goals, it will 
probably work out for you.
The upcoming assessment gives you a good idea of your strengths. Knowing 
your leadership style may help you understand why you lead the way you do, 
whether changing your style will be easy, and what kind of people you need 
to hire to compensate for some areas of weakness.
On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being never and 5 being always, use Table 6-1 to 
rate yourself on the following statements:
1. I like power and control.
2. I listen to others, but I like to have the final word.
3. I am not an expert in all areas of my business.

98
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
4. I don’t care what others think; I do what is best for me.
5. I like shared decision-making.
6. I prefer control to be with my followers.
7. I micromanage.
8. I like to recognize achievement.
9. Group members should create their own goals.
10. I do not trust my employees.
11. I like to encourage collaboration.
12. I allow group members to solve their own problems.
13. Employees do only what they’re told.
14. I want my business to run through teams.
15. I am not good at following up with employees.
16. I decide how to fix problems.
17. I like to help my employees grow and learn.
18. I give very little input because my employees know their jobs better 
than I do.
19. I don’t want to make time for employee input.
20. I like to hear the opinions of my employees.
21. Employees have the right to create their own objectives.
22. I like being in charge.
23. I want input from my employees.
24. I like my employees to make decisions on their own.
25. I tell my employees what to do, when to do it, and how to do it.
26. I want my employees to fulfill their potential.
27. I don’t want more authority than others in my organization.
28. Mistakes are not acceptable.
29. When things go wrong, I ask for advice from team members.
30. Power belongs to the entire organization.
The column with the highest total is the style you use most often. One high 
score with two low scores indicates a strong preference for that leadership 
style.

Adapting Your Leadership Style
Leadership styles change according to situations, needs, and the business 
environment. During a turnover in staff, for example, delegative leadership may 
not be best. In this section you find out what necessitates changes in leader­
ship style and what leadership techniques and responsibilities are possible.
Changing styles
Leadership style affects employee motivation and, consequently, productiv­
ity. You need to be aware of your dominant style and be ready to change your 
style for different situations. The wise leader knows that his style may be good 
for some employees but not for others. (Recognizing what employees respond 
to is dependent on a leader’s emotional self-awareness. Chapter 8 delves into 
emotional intelligence.)
Circumstances may force you to change your leadership style. Some exam­
ples include
	
✓	Big changes in the business leave little time for training employees and 
call for authoritative leadership.
	
✓	When an organization reaches a point at which all employees are well-
trained and attuned to the vision of the company, a more delegative 
style is appropriate.

100
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
	
✓	If your company hires a large group of Generation X and Y workers who 
need freedom and input for their jobs, you might want to try a more 
democratic leadership style.
	
✓	A big project with a short deadline that allows no time to ask for group 
decision-making calls for slightly authoritarian leadership.
	
✓	When the economy is down, stock prices have tanked, the company 
must pull together and work only on products that produce revenue. In 
order to save employees’ jobs, some must change current duties and 
take on new ones. You need an authoritarian approach.
	
Leadership style is a choice. Circumstances can cause you to change your 
style; certain departments or teams require a different kind of leadership than 
the rest of your business. The smart leader is ready to modify her leadership 
to meet the needs of all employees.
Noting further leadership techniques 
and responsibilities
As circumstances present themselves, you may have to make some changes 
in how you lead by adding some influential approaches to working with subor­
dinates. You have a responsibility to your employees to lead using whatever 
strategies work best for the good of your workers and your organization. The 
situational leader diagnoses problems and responds in appropriate ways to 
change the circumstances or make them fit into the vision of the organization.
The charismatic leader
You may think immediately of a world leader like John Fitzgerald Kennedy 
when the word charisma is associated with leadership. A leader needs to be 
charismatic or to find someone in the organization who can take that role. 
There are times when the one sharing the company vision must be captivat­
ing and convincing. Often the leader herself can do this because the vision is 
so personal as well as professional — the leader feels this vision within her 
soul. But there are leaders who have difficulty expressing themselves, and a 
leader cannot be all things to all people.
The charismatic leader
	
✓	Is extremely self-confident
	
✓	Is an inspirational speaker
	
✓	Has high emotional intelligence
	
✓	Stimulates questions
	
✓	Energizes the environment

101
 Chapter 6: Becoming the Leader You Want to Be
Short-term projects and projects that require energy and motivation need 
charismatic leadership. One of the problems with charisma is that an organi­
zation’s success may rest on a leader’s charisma, and so productivity suffers 
when the leader is gone.
The transformational leader
Transformational leaders charge toward change. You might take on this role 
as the new leader of an organization or the current leader who knows that 
without change the organization can become obsolete. The transformational 
responsibility includes a new vision, a map for that vision, and inspiration for 
others to follow.
Transformational leaders do the following:
	
✓	Challenge the status quo
	
✓	Offer intellectual stimulation
	
✓	Use influence rather than authority
Companies that are stagnant and require change need transformational 
leadership.
The visionary leader
Visionary leaders look into the future and share with stakeholders what lies 
ahead. Stating the vision, defining the vision, and creating the big picture of 
the organization in the minds of every employee and all stakeholders is the 
primary responsibility of every leader.
Visionary leaders
	
✓	Know exactly what they want
	
✓	Share the big picture for all to see
	
✓	Win people over
	
✓	Speak about and act on their vision
Visionaries are often motivating. Seeing and sharing long-term goals, they 
often see the best for all involved in the organization.
The reflective leader
Reflecting on the state of your organization — its successes, failures, oppor­
tunities, and so on — is an opportunity to reassess the direction you’re 
taking. The brain shows great activity during reflection time, and reflection 
offers an opportunity to place more information into long-term memory. 
Reflection is not a luxury; it is a responsibility.

102
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Reflective leadership characteristics include
	
✓	Emotional intelligence skills
	
✓	Ability to admit weaknesses
	
✓	Knowing when actions conflict with the values of the organization
Some reflective leaders keep journals in order to record information that may 
help the entire organization. All leaders need to take time for reflection to pro­
vide more insight as they encounter decisions that can impact the organization.
The collaborative leader
Every leader must maintain relationships within the organization. Great lead­
ers manage to work well with teams and individuals to keep their vision and 
sight and fulfill the organization’s mission.
Collaborators tend to
	
✓	Build trust with employees
	
✓	Include everyone
	
✓	Ensure fairness and openness
Collaboration helps build environments in which new and creative ideas are 
generated. Being collaborative can promote the development of plans to 
increase productivity.
The analytic leader
Leaders need to make the important things measurable instead of making 
measurable details important. Analyzing figures and looking at bottom lines 
are important. But analyzing and problem-solving do not involve only looking 
at data that has been gathered; leaders need to examine that data and form 
questions whose answers can take the organizations to higher productivity 
levels.
Analytic leaders do the following:
	
✓	Look at hard data
	
✓	Base decisions on facts
	
✓	Control their emotions
Analyzing data is an important component of good leadership. In good times 
or bad, you must know the bottom line to reach your goals. Following the 
data often leads to decision-making, but this leaves out the feelings and opin­
ions of others. As you analyze, keep your emotional intelligence skills in mind 
and include your own feelings and the feelings of others who are affected by 
the decision.

N
umbers are important in the world of business. The data you collect 
on products sold, the number of your employees, and the bottom line 
on your profit and loss statement are reliable and useful. Numbers indicat­
ing someone’s intelligence may be less than reliable. In the 21st century, 
the important measure may not be how intelligent you are, but how you are 
intelligent.
A neuroscientist might tell you that your intelligence lies in the top layer of 
your brain, the neocortex, because judgment, decision-making, and future 
planning all reside in this area. Albert Einstein may be the person you think 
of as the smartest person who ever lived. But his entire neocortex was not 
larger than average; rather, it was found to be thinner than others. Some 
specific areas of his brain showed marked differences that many believe were 
the source of his genius.
Intelligence in Einstein’s brain may be different from the intelligence that 
you possess. Scientific research suggests something unheard of even 15 
years ago — intelligence isn’t fixed. In other words, you can increase your 
intelligence throughout your life.
This chapter introduces you to various definitions of intelligence from the 
conventional to the nontraditional and shows you that how you are smart 
may be more important than you think. The information you find here may 
affect your hiring practices, the makeup of your teams, how you delegate 
work, and which tasks you do yourself.
Machiavelli said, “The first method for estimating the intelligence of a ruler is 
to look at the men he has around him.” As a leader, your success depends on 
the men and women you employ and place in the correct positions.

Grasping General Intelligence
Researchers used to think that people were born with a brain that was a 
blank slate, one that could be taught just about anything that was presented 
in the appropriate way. Others believed that DNA was destiny. You could 
either blame your educators for not filling your brain with what you needed 
to know, or blame Mom and Dad for any failures — they didn’t provide the 
genetic combinations to make you smart.
Testing intelligence
Some call intelligence G for general intelligence, others call it IQ or intel­
ligence quotient — the number derived by dividing your mental age (deter­
mined by a test) by your chronological age and then multiplying that figure 
by 100. Intelligence tests, which you can find on the Internet, face looming 
questions about validity.
	
Alfred Binet is credited with the first intelligence test. Designed to discover 
children with special needs, the test was based on comparisons with children 
of the same age. It included items such as naming parts of the body, counting, 
vocabulary, and filling in missing words in sentences.
The intelligence tests used today are designed to predict academic success. 
Intelligence testing shows little correlation with your career success; your IQ 
score may have little effect on what you accomplish in life.
The stuff you learn: Crystal intelligence
When you learned the states and their capitals, your multiplication tables, 
and how to write an essay, you added to your crystal intelligence — learned 
intelligence that includes the knowledge you’ve accumulated and the experi­
ences you’ve had. Your crystal intelligence is measured by the standardized 
tests you took at school. Researchers believe that your crystal intelligence 
increases throughout most of your life.
Thinking outside the box: 
Fluid intelligence
Fluid intelligence is the ability to look at things from a different angle, use 
abstract reasoning, and problem-solve. This kind of intelligence is inde­
pendent of learned knowledge. So those states and capitals that added to 

105
 Chapter 7: Harnessing Multiple Intelligences
your crystal intelligence did nothing for your fluid intelligence. Researchers 
think that fluid intelligence peaks during young adulthood and then declines 
throughout your life.
Those who are capable of changing strategies easily when dealing with new 
and different problems are said to have a high degree of fluid intelligence. 
Most intelligence tests measure crystal and fluid intelligence. But much of the 
new thinking about intelligence and its measurement is changing the need for 
IQ tests.
Discovering Multiple Intelligences
When it comes to discovering how you are intelligent, a psychologist named 
Howard Gardner came up with some great ideas. In 1972, Gardner was co-
director of Project Zero, a research group at Harvard University that was 
established in 1967. Project Zero’s mission is investigating how organiza­
tions, adults, and children develop learning processes. Gardner questioned 
the singularity of intelligence and searched for evidence that there was more 
than one way of being intelligent, of knowing.
Gardner proposed a theory of multiple intelligences in 1983. At that time, he 
anticipated seven intelligences. Later he added an eighth and finally a ninth. 
The following are the nine intelligences defined by Gardner that I address in 
this chapter:
	
✓	Verbal/linguistic
	
✓	Mathematical/logical
	
✓	Musical/rhythmic
	
✓	Visual/spatial
	
✓	Bodily kinesthetic
	
✓	Naturalist
	
✓	Interpersonal
	
✓	Intrapersonal
	
✓	Philosophical/moral/ethical
	
Understanding and using multiple intelligences in the workplace can help you 
see the gifts that your employees bring to the table and assist you in predict­
ing how employees will work together well (and determining why they don’t). 
It can help you see your own intelligences and understand why you have the 
people you have around you as well as whom you might need.

106
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
You can look at employees’ IQ scores, their grades from high school and 
college, and their class ranks, but none of that information tells you the 
whole story.
The Temporal Intelligences
Language, music, and mathematics relate to either sequencing or timing. 
Each of these temporal ways of knowing relies on the ability to rapidly 
sequence digits, letters, or notes in a way that shows comprehension and the 
ability to manipulate these sequences.
The capability to insert meaning into such sequences as numerals, letters, 
and musical notes are basic to our human existence. Frank Sinatra’s ability 
to sing “Chicago, Chicago, that toddling town” provides us with information 
in an emotional tone that has taken musical notes and sequenced and timed 
them to be pleasing to the ear. Verbal/linguistic information from the visitor’s 
bureau in Chicago would instead be presented in logical, informational, and 
even geographic format.
Verbal/linguistic intelligence
She was in your leadership class. She took great notes. She wrote the most 
comprehensive business plan the professor had ever seen. Effortlessly, she 
took words and created beautiful pictures that everyone understood. You 
wanted to hate her. But you couldn’t. She talked you right out of it. She lis­
tened to you, spoke poetically, and helped you write your business plan. 
Such are the qualities of the verbal/linguistically intelligent person. She could 
have been a he, by the way. Although (as you see in Chapter 12) females have 
a brain edge when it comes to language, many men have this intelligence.
The upcoming sections detail the traits that define this kind of intelligence.
Telling it like it is
	
Networks of neurons in the temporal and frontal lobe of the brain are strong 
and plentiful. One of these networks, called Wernicke’s area, is located in the 
left sensory lobe and contains a mental lexicon of words that flow beautifully 
through speech or writing. Broca’s area, found in the left frontal lobe, offers 
the gift of grammar that puts together sentences that summarize, paraphrase, 
and translate information as this brain solves problems, tells stories, and 
sometimes makes you laugh.
People with a high level of linguistic ability succeed at most of the following:

107
 Chapter 7: Harnessing Multiple Intelligences
	
✓	Writing reports
	
✓	Analyzing written and verbal information
	
✓	Understanding written and verbal language
	
✓	Telling stories
	
✓	Listening to stories and remembering them
	
✓	Adding humor when they speak
	
✓	Telling jokes
	
✓	Using language that suits the audience
	
✓	Organizing written and verbal information
Communicating at work
Every organization requires the skills of verbal/linguistic intelligence. 
Perhaps you have those skills and your organization is small enough that you 
have it all covered. If you’re working in a larger company, you need others to 
take on various verbal/linguistic tasks. Table 7-1 shows ways you might put 
verbal/linguistic intelligence to work.

Mathematical/logical intelligence
Even back in high school she was a killjoy. You know, the girl who always 
comes up with the reason why we can’t do something fun, something risky. 
We’d all be hanging out and someone would say, “Let’s hop in the convert­
ible and go scoop the loop on Main Street Hill.” Almost everyone would jump 
up and say, “Yes, let’s do it!” And then there would be that voice of reason, 
the logical one in our group who would come up with every “what if” in the 
book. What if the cops are cruising Main Street and there are too many of us 
in the car? What about some of the undesirable guys who hang around Main 
Street? (Wasn’t that why we were going?) What if our parents find out? If we 
got arrested, we’d never get into college. We’d have police records. Everyone 
would talk about us at school. And we’d get grounded. The logic was a killer. 
She had it all figured out. We never scooped the loop.
Mathematical/logical intelligence is much more than math. Solving problems 
in a logical way and being able to communicate that logic, dealing with sci­
entific and technical information, and fixing faulty machinery or products 
are talents of a person who has this gift. The ability to use logic to perform 
tasks in a sequential manner and unravel mysteries following a pattern of 
sequences are additional traits of this temporal intelligence.
Grasping more than numbers
Mathematical/logical people may be political. Politics involves organizing 
people and laws in a logical manner. The mythical detective Sherlock Holmes 
had a logical intelligence. Clue-gathering and intuitive reasoning are charac­
teristics of this brainpower.
	
Even if you don’t think you’re a math person, you were born with some pro­
pensity for math. The ability to see abstract patterns, to comprehend logical 
and mathematical formulas and concepts is a right hemisphere function. Your 
parietal lobe is where your brain problem solves.
People high in mathematical/logical intelligence do well with these tasks:
	
✓	Calculating
	
✓	Estimating
	
✓	Measuring
	
✓	Remaining unbiased
	
✓	Using logic
	
✓	Grouping
	
✓	Scientific reasoning
	
✓	Organizing or ordering

109
 Chapter 7: Harnessing Multiple Intelligences
	
✓	Testing hypotheses
	
✓	Reasoning
Doing a number at work
Even if you aren’t number smart, you may be logical or scientific. Not every­
one with a strong preference for an intelligence exhibits all of the character­
istics associated with it. For example, some people balance their checkbooks 
to the penny but have no ability to remember card sequences and so have 
difficulty with games such as bridge or rummy.
Mathematical/logical aptitudes may be important in your organization in 
several areas. Table 7-2 proposes some possible job descriptions for this 
intelligence.

Musical/rhythmic intelligence
You may think he’s crazy as you watch him through the glass walls in his 
office. And maybe he is. But it’s good crazy. The way he pushes his chair on 
its wheels from one side of the office to the other is interesting enough. But 
he does it to a rhythm that you can’t quite put your finger on. He moves from 
desk to desk, almost flying in that chair, as he hits the buttons on the com­
puters and the video screens that keep the small television station up and 
running. He’s his own television show. He watches the screen, pushes a key, 
swivels the chair so he can view the screen behind him, grabs the edge of the 
desk and with one mighty push and a twirl, he’s at the other lineup of screens 
ready to type and to push off again.
This man has musical/rhythmic intelligence, and he’s great at what he does. 
His ability to follow a sequence of steps and put them to his own personal 
rhythm reinforces his skill.
Tapping potential
The person with a talent for rhythm and music is an auditory learner. A lis­
tener as well as a tapper. Musical/rhythmic people hear the sounds of your 
equipment and know when a machine isn’t running right. They hear what you 
say and remember it.
People with musical/rhythmic intelligence have the following attributes:
	
✓	Interpret changes in sound and pitch
	
✓	Work to a rhythm
	
✓	Remember what they hear
	
✓	Pick out appropriate music for any audience
	
✓	Notice changes in the buzz of conversation
	
✓	Can be easily distracted
	
✓	Pick up foreign languages easily
	
✓	Hear and repeat dialects
	
✓	Create interesting multi-media presentations
If you have this intelligence, you may find that you need to have background 
music for meetings and for work. You may find yourself overhearing conver­
sations without intending to do so. Distracting sounds may make you irri­
table because they interrupt your thought processes.

111
 Chapter 7: Harnessing Multiple Intelligences
	
The brain responds well to music. The novice musician experiences and 
enjoys music in the right hemisphere of the brain. A trained musician, how­
ever, uses the left hemisphere to critique the music and may show more activ­
ity in this hemisphere than the right.
Working to the beat
Unless your business is music-related, you’re unlikely to have a specific job 
for the musical/rhythmic person. Not everyone can make a living from song-
writing or becoming a disc jockey, and many people use intelligences other 
than their highest intelligence at work.
Placing a musical/rhythmic person under your leadership may include posi­
tions such as those in Table 7-3.

The Spatial Intelligences
Three of the nine intelligences are processed in the right hemisphere and 
deal with spaces and places. Visual/spatial, bodily kinesthetic, and natural­
ist intelligence are all spatially oriented. The ability to determine where you 
are in space and where you are going is part of what makes us human. Every 
organization needs to have those members who excel at determining where 
the business is and whether it’s heading in the right direction as it follows its 
vision and mission. A spatially intelligent brain can comprehend the dynam­
ics of space (visual/spatial), successfully navigate within it (bodily kines­
thetic), and differentiate among the objects that occupy space (naturalist).

112
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Visual/spatial intelligence
He flies through the air with the greatest of ease. At least, you hope so. He 
has you 38,000 feet in the air, and you want him to land the plane safely. You 
want your pilot — and your surgeon, dentist, architect, and designer — to be 
high in visual/spatial intelligence. People expect artists, sculptors, and illus­
trators to have visual/spatial intelligence, but set designers, movie directors, 
and actors have it, too. Mountain climbers, skate boarders, and dancers all 
have a high degree of this talent, as well.
Getting the picture
In the movie The Devil Wears Prada, lowly assistant Andrea is picked on 
because she doesn’t appreciate the number of people and the amount of time 
that went into the colors and design of the clothing that she bought off the 
rack. Not being a very visual or spatial person, Andi threw on her clothes and 
walked out the door. She was a journalist with obvious verbal/linguistic talents. 
As the story unfolds, Andrea changes by becoming more sensitive to color and 
design. By the end of the movie she appreciates the work done by her cowork­
ers, but decides this life is not for her and returns to her journalistic goals.
Andrea had a stronger orientation toward verbal/linguistics. She obviously 
also showed some strength in visual spatial skills, which may not have 
emerged without her job opportunity at a fashion magazine. Sometimes gifts 
and talents don’t manifest themselves without the proper opportunity. Every 
normal brain has functioning areas for each of the intelligences; therefore 
each brain has the possibility of functioning via each intelligence.
Just as clothing designers are responsible for what people wear, the DVD and 
CD cover designers influence what people buy and rent. It takes a high degree 
of skill to make a cover catch your eye and make you believe that what’s 
inside is the most exciting or violent or scary movie that you’ve ever seen.
	
Visual/spatial intelligence lies mostly in the right hemisphere of the brain. The 
right parietal lobe enables the brain to visualize objects and move them 
around in the mind to discover the best arrangement for them, and the right 
occipital lobe stores visual information.
Characteristics of visual/spatial intelligence include the following:
	
✓	Sensitivity to color, form, and space
	
✓	Understanding and creating visual representations
	
✓	Reading graphs, charts, and so on
	
✓	Preference for things to be in place and pleasing to the eye
	
✓	Rotating objects in the mind

 Chapter 7: Harnessing Multiple Intelligences
Finding a spot
Everyone wants to find a spot where his desires and goals are fulfilled. Some 
find it at work; others use their highest intelligence outside of work. Kathy 
is a highly paid administrative assistant at a large prestigious law firm. She 
has been with the firm for 30 years. She’s efficient and full of energy. When 
she leaves work, she becomes a Martha Stewart clone. She walks through 
craft stores and flea markets where she buys scraps of material and bags of 
sand that become centerpieces for a wedding. With an extraordinary eye for 
color, she blends fresh flowers with tropical grasses, adds some wire, makes 
a bird’s nest and voila — a serving table for a South African barbecue.
When Kathy retires, she wants to be a party and wedding planner. She has an 
intelligence that is waiting to be unleashed on a professional level. You may 
have on staff a Kathy or an Andrea ready for your leadership skills to place 
her where she can contribute to your organization in a more valuable way.

Bodily kinesthetic intelligence
Michael Jordan steals the ball, dribbles down the floor, and in a movement 
that looks like flying, lifts his body in the air and gracefully stuffs the ball into 
the basket — an extreme example of bodily kinesthetic intelligence.
For a decade most boys and some girls yearned to be “like Mike.” According 
to Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers, becoming like Mike might take some 
time — about ten years or 10,000 hours of practice for such expertise. Had 
those starry-eyed children been told that information, some of them might 
have buckled down and done more work. Jordan certainly worked hard to 
develop his body and his skill. Genetics play a part in having the height for 
basketball, but developing the body and skill requires opportunity, practice, 
and desire.
	
Brain areas pertinent to this intelligence include the motor cortex, the basal 
ganglia, and the cerebellum. (Chapter 2 tells you more about these parts of 
the brain.) The motor cortex controls movement while the basal ganglia and 
cerebellum navigate movement.
The best job for the one
Because of her flexibility, endurance, agility, 
and speed, Ashlee’s work at the shipping and 
receiving department of the corporation was 
superb. She was in good health, partly because 
she was constantly walking, running, or loading 
packages. Her pedometer usually read 15,000 
steps by the end of her workday. Interestingly, 
her manager suggested a promotion for the 
loyal, hard worker. The position was supervi­
sory and landed Ashlee at a desk. She hated 
her new job, but the $10,000 it tacked on to her 
yearly salary was too hard to pass up. Sitting at 
her desk day after day making schedules and 
doing other paperwork made her so unhappy 
that she begged her manager for a demotion 
back to her previous position. It took another six 
months before a job became available. Excited 
about her return, she eagerly pursued her previ­
ous record of speed and accuracy. The months 
away from her rigorous routine, however, left 
her in poorer physical shape than she had ever 
been. It took her months to regain her former 
level of work.
When Ashlee used her bodily-kinesthetic intel­
ligence, she was happier and more productive. 
The Peter Principle states that every employee 
rises to her level of incompetence. So often 
employees are rewarded for doing a good job 
by being offered a higher-ranking job with a 
higher salary. Eventually, they may end up in 
a position that does not suit their capabilities. 
Ashlee could do the job, but she was miser­
able because the job didn’t fit her intelligence 
strength.

Bodily kinesthetic characteristics are not just about sports. They’re about 
movement — fine motor and gross motor movement. They’re about touch 
and feelings, and navigating your way through space — on a field, in a car, in

of intelligence:
	
✓	Physical endurance
	
✓	Flexibility
	
✓	Muscle control
	
✓	Physical fitness and overall good health
	
✓	Fine and gross motor skills
	
✓	Agility and speed

Naturalist intelligence
“Roughing it” for Zack was staying at the Holiday Inn Express. Raised in the 
city, Zack was dragged to the zoo and the park when he really just wanted to 
be reading. He read about wildlife and had a rock collection, but he preferred 
the great indoors. To inspire team growth, the Fortune 500 company that 
Zack worked for decided to send several of the teams on an Outward Bound 
expedition. Zack didn’t know whether to quit his job or call in sick. But he 
really liked his job and wanted to stay with this company for a few years, so 
off he went.
Much to Zack’s surprise, his extensive reading came to life as he learned to 
start campfires, navigate the water, and observe weather changes. His natural­
ist intelligence blossomed through this experience, and he adapted to his new 
environment as quickly as his teammates who were used to living with nature.
The naturalist is a must-have intelligence in any organization that is trying to 
make the world a greener place. Sensitivity to nature and an understanding of 
what is happening to the environment is an intelligence that is gaining respect 
and admiration. But the naturalist is more. She relates to her surroundings 
and knows how she fits in — a natural skill for a leader or a follower.
	
The brain’s left parietal lobe helps people discriminate between living and 
non-living things. The right hemisphere provides the big picture of where you 
are in your environment. The prefrontal cortex processes empathy and ethics. 
The naturalist intelligence involves the connections among these brain areas.
Classifying and then some
Classifying and categorizing things in nature have long been useful skills for 
working in museums, zoos, and state parks. Now major corporations are 
“going green” and need this talent to assist them in making many choices to 
preserve and serve the environment.
The naturalist may have the following gifts:
	
✓	Interest in nature
	
✓	Ability to classify and categorize things in nature
	
✓	Collecting natural objects
	
✓	Enhanced alertness to their environment
	
✓	Affinity for animals
	
✓	Keen sensory skills

Nurturing the naturalist
The naturalist at work is going to be most comfortable in a natural setting, 
probably outdoors. Short of that, a room with plants, windows, and natural 
sunlight may suit this person best. The naturalist can add a lot to your orga­
nization whether you’re in the green movement or not. Perhaps you’re the 
“natural” leader for your business. Or perhaps you need one.
Table 7-6 shows you possibilities for positions for the naturalist.

The Personal and Social Intelligences
The entire brain takes part in the personal and social intelligences. The fron­
tal lobes in both the right and left hemispheres are particularly involved in 
building and maintaining relationships, understanding yourself, and knowing 
right from wrong.

Interpersonal intelligence
She is the one everyone turns to in your organization. Sometimes called 
a “shadow leader,” this woman has the ability to put others at ease, and 
employees feel comfortable asking her about processes, problems, and 
procedures. She listens carefully and treats others in a way that shows she 
understands them. Some of the team leaders envy her seemingly innate 
ability to communicate and build rapport with others. But everyone has 
interpersonal intelligence, and some work at it more than others. You 
wouldn’t have others following you if you didn’t have a high level of this 
intelligence. And if you follow the suggestions in Chapter 8, you can raise 
your level of this intelligence, as well.
The people in the workplace with high levels of this intelligence have win­
ning personalities. As part of a team, they usually are the team leaders. When 
you need someone with good social skills, an awareness of and concern for 
others, and ability to relate to people in general, you call on someone with 
high interpersonal intelligence.
Building relationships
This people person reads others well. Recognizing others’ moods, intentions, 
and motivations, interpersonal people are good negotiators and great friends. 
Among the characteristic they are known for are the following:
	
✓	Valuing relationships
	
✓	Collaboration ability
	
✓	Sharing their personal stories
	
✓	Natural leadership ability
	
The brain structures involved in creating this intelligence are the frontal lobe, 
the right temporal lobe, and the limbic system. These formations help you 
understand how others feel, get the gist of how those feelings relate to the cur­
rent environment, and assist in building relationships.
Social graces in all the right places
Having the ability to negotiate, persuade, and affect the working life of others 
is one way the interpersonally intelligent brain operates. Mediation powers 
make this person a good negotiator, counselor, and salesperson.

Intrapersonal intelligence
Kendra’s favorite book is one from childhood called I Like Me, and that title 
is her motto. She has become her own best friend. Kendra knows her flaws 
and works with her strengths. She has clear goals and every intention of 
reaching them. She makes decisions with her best interest in mind. That 
doesn’t mean she neglects others’ feelings or needs, but Kendra knows her­
self better than anyone else and has a strong sense of purpose. Everyone 
wants to be on Kendra’s team because she helps make it a winning team — 
it’s for her own good!
The person with this intelligence knows his or her own strengths and weak­
nesses. Having the ability to recognize when to remain in a situation and 
when to leave reveals a level of intelligence and maturity that belongs in 
every organization.

Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Knowing thyself
Evaluating yourself in relation to your position at work and in life can 
be a valuable tool for redirecting or reinventing oneself or one’s career. 
Recognizing your own feelings and responding to them in a constructive way 
are attributes of intrapersonal intelligence.
	
The frontal lobe of the brain integrates your feelings from the limbic system 
and sensory information from the parietal lobe. These connections help 
people with this intelligence address their feelings in an appropriate way as 
they realize their needs and desires.
Some characteristics of this intelligence include
	
✓	Recognizing your own strengths and utilizing them 
	
✓	Recognizing your own weaknesses and working on them
	
✓	Ability to work alone and enjoy it
	
✓	Understanding your own needs
	
✓	Knowing how to motivate yourself
	
✓	Accepting responsibility for own success and failures
	
✓	Using feedback to better yourself
To thine own self be true
In order to maintain a positive outlook as he deals with the introspection 
of his life, the intrapersonally intelligent person works on understanding 
his experiences and how they affect his life. You rarely find people who are 
guided more by their own values than by the values of others or of society, 
because so many people are taught to please others.
The ability to direct oneself is one reason a person of this intelligence may be 
very important to your organization. The second reason may be even more 
important for the 21st century: With jobs changing rapidly, a person who 
knows a lot about him or herself can be more easily trained and change posi­
tion more easily. This can be the most important intelligence to have in the 
global business world.

Philosophical/moral/ethical intelligence
Two teams, two team leaders, one department. Holly knows the difference 
between right and wrong. She does the right thing at the right time for the right 
reason. Her team members have never seen her “borrow” supplies, favor a 
friend, or work against the company’s best interest to put her team ahead.
Brad leads the other team. He sometimes tells little white lies to his superiors 
if his team isn’t exactly up to par. Brad moved one of his best friends into 
the department and onto his team so they could spend more time together. 
Unfortunately, his friend isn’t a very good team player, and the team is 
floundering. Brad asks Holly to help out his team. She said she would if she 
had full rein. Brad agreed. Holly immediately placed Brad’s friend in a dif­
ferent department where he could be useful. She then suggested that Brad 
step down and turn over the team to someone who could model fairness, a 
strong work ethic, and responsibility for moving the company forward. Brad 
refused, took back his control, and — just to show Holly — brought his friend 
back on board.
As Holly’s team raced ahead, reaching goals and moving the company for­
ward, Brad’s team members began to beg to move to Holly’s team. The senior 
team leader evaluated the situation. Brad was moved to a different depart­
ment where his talents could be used without harm to the company or to 
other employees. Holly took over the entire department.

Philosophical/moral/ethical intelligence is the heart of good leadership. Many 
seemingly strong businesses have fallen under the influence of leaders who 
lack moral and ethical intelligence. Having ethical leaders, managers, and 
employees is necessary for any business success.
A morally intelligent person has the following traits:
	
✓	Integrity
	
✓	Honesty
	
✓	Impartiality
	
✓	Fairness
	
✓	Adherence to ethical policies

How Are You Smart? Self-Assessment
You may find that what you do at work and what you might like to do are 
somewhat different. But anything is possible when it comes to brains. You 
have the potential to develop every one of the intelligences. For instance, you

may be very good at math but would rather spend your time using verbal/
linguistic intelligence to communicate within the company and with clients. 
You may find that you are very visual, but graphs and charts aren’t appealing 
to you, and you prefer to have someone else translate that data.
You have the power to pick the people with those intelligences you need on 
your team to fill in the gaps for you. The self assessment that follows can 
give you some ballpark ideas about yourself, and you may choose to use this 
assessment on your workers as well. I find that most people enjoy knowing 
more about themselves. You’ll hear some say “Wow, I never knew I was so 
good at. . . .” Or, “I always thought I was musically talented, I’d like to try to fit 
that into the business in some way.”
To determine your predominant intelligence, rank how often each of the 
following statements is true for you. Use a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being never, 
2 being rarely, 3 being sometimes, and 4 being always. Record your responses 
in Table 7-10.

Chapter 8
Assessing and Applying Your 
Emotional Intelligence
In This Chapter
▶	Figuring out what emotions do for you
▶	Taking a close look at your own emotions
▶	Drawing on emotions for motivation
▶	Becoming sensitive to others’ emotions
▶	Changing the emotional climate in your office
▶	Addressing emotions gone wild
W
hen Descartes said that the emotions and the intellect were separate, 
he was wrong. And neuroscientists continually prove that we cannot 
separate the mind, the body, and emotions.
Emotional intelligence (often referred to as EQ) is the ability to recognize 
and use your emotions wisely. It’s vital for working with others, and it can 
be learned, nurtured, and enhanced. Your emotional intelligence and that 
of your workforce can make the difference between success and failure. 
Working with other emotionally intelligent people is more motivating and fun 
than working with those with low EQs and high cognitive ability.
Intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences (see Chapter 7) are part of 
this intelligence, but emotional intelligence is a talent that everyone can and 
should develop. High EQ people can control and even change their emotions. 
Controlling your emotions helps you recognize the emotions of others, and 
that emotional detection enables you to handle someone else’s emotions and 
lead others to your way of thinking. Through honest emotional relationships 
you work better with your employees, peers, and customers.
In professional situations, you must be able to handle yourself in order to 
communicate in an appropriate manner. Emotions sometimes reveal them­
selves quickly; having power over those emotions can be beneficial because 
it gives you time to think and respond logically as well as to understand the 
emotions of the person you’re dealing with.

128
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Your emotions are part of who you are. Understand and use your emotions 
wisely, and you become a better communicator, leader, partner, parent, and 
friend. In this chapter, I show you the components of emotional intelligence, 
show you how to recognize others who are high in this intelligence, and give 
you tips for using emotional intelligence to your advantage.
Grasping the Role of Emotions
Cognitive scientists sometimes refer to our emotions as emotional states. An 
emotional state is a combination of thoughts, feelings, and physiology. These 
states arise from responses to environmental cues. You respond to these 
cues emotionally, and doing so creates your thoughts. Every thought you 
think is in response to some level of emotion. Emotions cause you to change 
your behavior in order to survive. Whether to save yourself physically or 
socially, your emotions react to the environment you’re in.
Reacting to your environment
The fly is buzzing around your picnic table driving you crazy. You take the 
kung fu approach and try to catch the fly in your hand as it buzzes by. You 
fail. You roll up the nearest magazine and swat at the fly but miss. The fly 
returns, and he seems to be even quicker. That pesky fly has changed his 
The rise of EQ
In 1995 science writer and psychologist Daniel 
Goleman wrote Emotional Intelligence: Why It 
Can Matter More Than IQ. This book caused a 
sensation and a keen interest in how important 
a role emotions play in our lives. Although some 
people thought emotional intelligence would 
fall by the wayside as trends tend to do, the 
research behind his book and the studies that 
have been done since have shown that emo­
tionally intelligent people may be more valuable 
in the workplace and as leaders than those with 
high grades and impressive test scores.
Many schools have tried to incorporate emo­
tional learning into their curriculums. Illinois is 
the first state to require that social emotional 
learning be taught in the classroom. Carefully 
written state standards guide the implementa­
tion of this curriculum.
Incidentally, a high EQ may be good for your 
career in yet another way: A recent study 
revealed that doctors with exceptional people 
skills make just as many mistakes as doctors 
who don’t possess those skills. But the doctors 
who know how to talk to people and make them 
believe they care get sued less often.

129
 Chapter 8: Assessing and Applying Your Emotional Intelligence
behavior in order to survive. Why does he keep coming back if his life is in 
danger? Because he has to eat to survive. Instinctively, your fly reacts to the 
environment, darting and diving to get food and keep from getting squashed.
It seems like a tough life, but you react in similar ways every day. On a purely 
survival level, you sprint across the street to keep from getting hit by a truck. 
On a more cognitive level, you respond in conversation depending on whom 
you are speaking to: with a close friend, you can throw in some expletives, 
with your mother-in-law not so much, and with your superior, you may be 
very careful in your use of language, context, and tone. Every action and reac­
tion is the result of an emotional state. The emotional state you’re in as you 
dart out of the truck’s path is based on your physiology (your racing heart 
and blood being pumped to your legs), your thoughts (“Oh, crud, I can’t 
believe I didn’t see this coming.”), and your feelings (“I don’t want to die!”).
Social survival
Emotions save your life. You look both ways before crossing the street 
because you fear death. (Or because you have your mother’s voice inside 
your head — not listening to Mom may mean certain death!)
Social death is another motivator. As a teenager, if I attended a party where 
alcohol was served and I had a drink, I would think, “Please, don’t let me get 
in a car accident tonight or my dad will find out and kill me.” My dad isn’t a 
violent man; he wasn’t going to physically end my life. But I would have been 
grounded, and that meant social death. Knowing I should not displease my 
dad kept me very cautious about getting caught and kept my grades up, as 
low grades would also have caused a social setback.
Your emotions often lie at a subconscious level. In every environment you 
learn the emotional and then cognitive responses that can help you survive 
and thrive under those particular circumstances. Some of these become so 
automatic that the reasons you react the way you do never enter your mind. 
Yet sometimes your purpose is clear, and you respond on a conscious level, 
using your emotional states as a basis for what is good for you at the time.
Becoming Self-Aware
Too much emotion at the wrong time isn’t good for vote-getting. Senator 
Edmund Muskie broke down when talking about the media’s attack on his 
wife in 1972. Many analysts say that misstep lost the election for him. Hillary 
Clinton, however, must have broken down at the right time. Her show of emo­
tions about the travails of the campaign made some voters see her as more 
human. Her campaign became stronger for a short while.

130
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Before you can identify and deal with emotions in others, you must begin to 
recognize and deal with your own emotions. Emotions are present in all rela­
tionships. Some emotions save lives and others can destroy. Although many 
people think high IQs are the determining factor for success in the business 
world, some studies show that emotional intelligence is a much stronger factor.
Noting your feelings
Sometimes emotions are elusive. You may not feel quite right, yet you’re 
not sure if you’re sad, depressed, or frustrated. One CEO used to answer the 
question, “How are you feeling?” with “What are my choices?” Although he 
was trying to be funny, he brings up an interesting question. Can you choose 
how you feel? Some psychologists believe that you can. First, you must be 
able to differentiate among emotions.
How well do you know yourself? If you can identify your emotions and deter­
mine what you think about that mood, you’re on your way to truly becoming 
self-aware. For instance, if you feel yourself becoming angry over a situa­
tion and think you might lose control of your actions or behaviors, you can 
choose your next action to create a better outcome.
Your sense of well-being relies on the emotional balance in your life. An 
extreme amount of emotion may lead you to poor decision-making, poor rela­
tionships, and poor self-esteem. When asked to name their emotions, most 
people list the following in no particular order:
	
✓	Happiness
	
✓	Sadness
	
✓	Anger
	
✓	Frustration
	
✓	Disgust
	
✓	Fear
These six emotions are considered universal emotions. In other words, 
people around the world experience these emotions and show them with the 
same kind of facial expressions. Consider how these emotions affect your 
performance, relationships, and reactions at work. Can you identify your own 
strengths and weaknesses? Doing so makes a difference in how you react to 
situations and to feedback from your employees and your customers.
Your brain’s prefrontal cortex is in charge of many executive functions, 
including attention. Self-awareness involves attending to your feelings — 
and that includes your physical responses. The prefrontal cortex interacts 

131
 Chapter 8: Assessing and Applying Your Emotional Intelligence
with areas in the brain related to bodily senses: heart rate, respiration, 
digestive system, and temperature, to name a few. Awareness that your 
heart is racing provides information for the prefrontal cortex to determine 
what you’re feeling and how you’re reacting to it on a physical level. Armed 
with this information, you can make some choices as to how you respond 
to or control the situation.
Other emotional intelligence skills are based on your self-awareness. You are 
a self-aware leader if the statements that follow are true of you:
	
✓	I recognize my emotions.
	
✓	I am in touch with my body and its responses.
	
✓	I know my strengths and weaknesses.
	
✓	I understand my goals, dreams, and hopes.
	
✓	I trust my instincts and usually make good decisions.
	
✓	My work and my values match.
	
✓	I am inspired or energized by my work.
	
✓	I take time to reflect.
	
If you feel that you aren’t good at recognizing your own emotions, try the 
following:
	
✓	Make the time to reflect upon your feelings throughout the day. How did 
you respond to them?
	
✓	Keep a journal of your feelings.
	
✓	When someone asks “How are you?” try to give a precise answer related 
to your current feelings. Instead of the automatic “fine” response, iden­
tify your feelings without boring people to death — “I’m curious about 
this meeting.”
	
✓	Keep a scorecard of your feelings over several weeks. Average those 
feelings to determine which emotions are most prevalent and how they 
may affect your relationships.
Using your emotions productively
After you know how to recognize your emotions, you can then work on han­
dling them. Emotional intelligence is not the ability to hide your feelings but 
rather to use your emotions wisely. Expressing your feelings in a productive 
way can be the difference between forming lasting relationships and destroy­
ing them. The prefrontal cortex of the brain plays a large part in regulating 
our emotions. However, the prefrontal cortex can also deregulate emotions.

132
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Imagine yourself at a leadership conference. You come upon one of your 
friendly competitors and begin a pleasant conversation. At one point your 
competitor mentions bidding on a contract that he assumes you also were 
invited to bid on; however, you were unaware of the opportunity. Suddenly, 
your mood changes. Your brain begins focusing on not only the fact that you 
did not get this rather large contract, but your company wasn’t notified of 
the bidding prospect. As the conversation continues, your competitor men­
tions another opportunity, one that everyone will be notified about. Your 
mind shifts to this new possibility and you listen with interest, but something 
in the back of your mind is bothering you. As you participate in this dialogue, 
you know that you aren’t as attentive as you should be. Your competitor feels 
somewhat rejected by your lack of interest and finds a reason to move on to 
speak with others.
Taking charge of emotions
During one corporate meeting at which leader­
ship, management, and workers were explor­
ing an obvious failure of a plan that had been 
initiated to increase production, the leadership 
was put “on the block.” Employees let their 
frustrations run the meeting; they were angry 
about the amount of time wasted for this proj­
ect. It had been a top-down idea, and employ­
ees ranted and raved over their feeling that they 
knew better how to create a successful plan.
The CEO’s stomach churned; his heart rate 
became rapid, and his mouth was dry as his 
brain took him down to survival level. He was in 
a full-blown fight-or-flight response and about 
to override the yelling. He imagined differ­
ent negative scenarios. But he caught himself 
before he was about to let loose. He walked 
a short distance from the others and counted 
to ten. He took several deep breaths. As he 
approached the front of the meeting room he 
put his hand up for silence as he picked up the 
microphone.
“I accept my responsibility for this failure,” he 
began. The room quieted down. He took another 
deep breath. “You are all correct in assuming 
we made a mistake by not including you in the 
planning. Sometimes I forget that I am not the 
only person who has the best interest of this 
company as a priority. You are the foundation 
of this entire organization. It is time to regroup. 
A planning committee will be formed with rep­
resentatives from each department. If you are 
not on this planning committee, please realize 
that we need all of you to put forth your efforts 
and indeed, your passion, to keep production as 
high as possible until we iron this out. Please 
e-mail me or make an appointment to see me 
if you have ideas that will help with this plan. I 
cannot promise that all recommendations will 
be used; that will be up to the new committee. 
But I promise that all will be considered.”
By the time he finished, his heart rate was back 
to normal and he smiled and nodded at this pas­
sionate group of people who were going to help 
turn this failure around. By recognizing his emo­
tions and putting forth effort to change them, he 
was able to keep control of the situation. And by 
admitting his weaknesses, he received empa­
thy and support from the crowd.

133
 Chapter 8: Assessing and Applying Your Emotional Intelligence
That nagging feeling of anger and frustration, perhaps even some fear over 
losing possible business, has caused you to damage the relationship you had 
with your competition. In the future, she may not feel obliged to share any 
pertinent information with you on potential contracts. The lack of control 
over your emotions can be very damaging.
If you monitor reactions such as these, you can learn to change them. What 
caused you to lose the connection in the conversation? Was it anger over 
feeling left out of the competition? Was it fear of not being good enough to be 
included? How can you overcome these feelings?
	
After any instance wherein your emotions take over your focus, take some 
time to reflect on what was going on inside your head. That inner dialogue was 
saying something to you that changed your feelings and your mood. 
Recognizing the reactions helps you gain control over them in the future.
Your attention to a conversation takes place in your working memory. 
Working memory is the active process of taking incoming information and 
connecting it to knowledge that you already have stored. As you spoke with 
the friendly competitor, your working memory was filled with the trivial 
information in your conversation until she mentioned the contract that you 
never got to bid on. Then the fear or anger from your amygdala, the emotional 
center in your brain, filled your working memory with doubts about yourself 
and your business. It was so full of these feelings and the thoughts that ema­
nated from them that you couldn’t focus on the rest of the conversation. Even 
after your curiosity was piqued by new information, the nagging thoughts 
remained and left you feeling uncomfortable and looking disinterested.
Lack of emotional control can hinder success. Learning to control your 
emotions in life-threatening situations is difficult, and controlling your 
emotions under perceived threat may be even more complicated. Some 
leaders respond to small hurdles as though their survival depended on it. 
Discovering what you need to handle your emotions and your impulses is 
sometimes a matter of trial and error.
What steps can you take to uncover and handle your emotions? Try the 
following:
	
1.	As you scan your work environment, be aware of those people, situa­
tions, spaces, and so on, that trigger emotional responses in you.
	
	You may find that small meetings held in a cubicle affect your need for 
space, for example. Suggest the meetings be held elsewhere.
	
2.	Examine those triggers and learn to recognize them.
	
	 If you find yourself feeling angry every day at a certain time and you 
don’t know why, take the time to go over any encounters you’ve had 
thus far and see whether you can pinpoint the problem.

134
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
	
3.	Determine the appropriate responses to each trigger.
	
	 As you become aware of repetitious responses, decide how you can con­
trol or change the emotional states that result from those environmental 
triggers.
	
4.	Make a list of any extraordinary challenges you face.
	
	 If you find recognizing and responding more appropriately to some trig­
gers but are unable to avoid those triggers, write down the encounters 
and try to figure out another approach when you are away from work 
and no longer emotional about the situation.
	
5.	Experiment with coping strategies.
	
	 If you experience chronic stress from these challenges, choose some 
strategies that have helped you in the past and try each one until you 
discover what lowers your stress most. For example, exercise, medita­
tion, or stopping by another colleague’s office to chat may help you 
keep your stress levels low. Make time to institute your favorite strategy 
regularly.
Stress expert and neuroscientist Bruce McEwen refers to the body’s adap­
tive responses to stress as allostasis. The body tries to adapt to the stress 
responses by maintaining balance or homeostasis. With just a little stress, 
the body produces hormones that improve your memory and help you 
store important information. Acute or chronic stress hinders these same 
processes.
If your allostatic load becomes too great, it affects your mood, emo­
tions, and behaviors. For instance, perhaps someone in your personal or 
professional life suggests that you might be stressed. You don’t believe 
them because you’re so used to the load you’re carrying that you aren’t 
conscious of your stress level. You think this person is crazy, but when a 
second person suggests you might need a break, even though you want to 
“shoot the messenger” you realize that would just prove their point. You 
decide to give it a try.
You put on your Alfred E. Newman tee shirt with the “What, Me Worry?” slogan 
and take off for the weekend. After all, you don’t want to miss work, you just 
want to appease these people in your life. You go on a golf weekend with 
your friends. The weather is great and you have a wonderful time. You think, 
“Maybe they were right! I do feel better. And now they will all leave me alone.”
When you return to the office with a healthy glow, all goes well — for a little 
while. The same old stressors are still there. Although you believe you have 
returned with a zero stress load, you find yourself flaring up more easily. 
Before the day is over, you realize that you can feel the stress. Why can’t you 
handle situations more easily? Why aren’t your emotions under control?

135
 Chapter 8: Assessing and Applying Your Emotional Intelligence
Your stress level before you take your weekend retreat is very high and has 
been for some time. After the weekend your stress levels are lower, but not 
even close to normal. So when the week begins and you have done nothing to 
manage the stressors at work or your responses to those stressors, you jump 
right back to where you were.
High stress levels endanger your health, your relationships with others, and 
your ability to maintain your vision and reach long-term goals. Stress changes 
your outlook from long-term to short-term. Getting through the day or through 
a project is as far-sighted as you can be. Stress keeps you in the moment.
Motivating Yourself to 
Move Toward Goals
Motivated people get things done. This emotional intelligence competency 
includes having both hope and optimism. In this section I show you how to 
motivate yourself and increase your hope and optimism, so that you may 
model these competencies and teach them to your employees.
Worth waiting for
You are four years old. You have just been 
offered a marshmallow — quite a treat for a 
child in the 1960s. But wait — if you don’t eat 
the marshmallow right now and wait for the 
marshmallow giver to return from an errand, 
you can get a second marshmallow. One now 
or two later? What’s a child to do?
Stanford University conducted the marshmal­
low test with four-year-olds and uncovered 
interesting information about impulse control. 
The initial impulse is to eat the marshmallow. 
It’s there. It looks delicious. But some of those 
youngsters were able to wait for up to twenty 
minutes. They distracted themselves. Some 
sang. Some ran around the room. Some just 
sat and stared at the marshmallow and waited. 
Others ate the marshmallow before the experi­
menter could leave the room. They weren’t 
waiting for anything.
These children were followed into adolescence 
where some striking differences showed up. 
Those who waited for the marshmallow were 
more socially adept, had more friends, and were 
more resilient, dependable, and goal-oriented 
than those who could not wait. The kids who 
waited scored an average of 200 more points 
on their SATs than the non-waiters. Delaying 
gratification and impulse control lead to better 
decision-making, the ability to get along with 
others, and controlling emotions in order to 
learn more.
The great news is that some of those four-year-
olds who were unable to delay gratification in 
the 60s learned the skill somewhere along the 
way. As adults, they are able to control their 
impulses and delay gratification. This important 
life skill is learnable. The brain can change!

Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
The prefrontal cortex, with the assistance of other brain structures, is in 
charge of self-motivation. Motivation comes from one of two sources: desire 
or need. If you or your brain feels you need something for your survival, you 
are motivated to do something about it. If what you’re doing has no survival 
value, then you must desire it.
Your goals, your dreams, and your vision motivate you. With an optimistic 
outlook, you provide hope for your followers. As your organization works 
toward your goals, you find yourself hopeful. All of this provides pleasure 
that activates the reward system in your brain. The neurotransmitter dopa­
mine is released, and it feels good. Because you want to maintain those good 
feelings, you are motivated to continue. Working toward a goal often is more 
pleasurable than attaining the goal. By the time you reach the goal, the brain 
has experienced enough of a reward for that particular accomplishment, and 
you’re on to the next goal with equal determination, drive, and dopamine!
Cultivating hope
Hope influences inspiration and motivation, which in turn move you toward 
your goals. You have hope when you look forward to attaining your goals. It 
gives you energy to get the job done. Your hope inspires you, and you inspire 
those around you.
As an emotionally intelligent person, hope keeps you from backing down 
in the face of diversity. Hope keeps you from being overcome by depres­
sion because of circumstances that affect your goals and vision. Hope keeps 
you trying. How do you remain hopeful? You can learn to motivate yourself. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	Break your goals down into small chunks.
	
2.	Focus on accomplishing one chunk until it’s finished.
	
3.	Celebrate when that chunk is accomplished.
	
	 Each accomplishment gives you hope that you can achieve more and 
accomplish not just the next chunk, but the entire goal.
Think about how you inspire yourself with hope. Then reflect on whether 
you use that hope to inspire others. Leaders with goals, visions, and hope 
are willing to reshape those goals, especially in times of turmoil and change. 
If you find that you’re unable to achieve any part of a goal, revisit the entire 
goal, rewrite it, and try again.

Moving from pessimism to optimism
If you’ve been accused of looking at the world through rose-colored glasses 
or of always seeing the glass as half full, you’re optimistic. Hope and opti­
mism are related. Optimists are usually hopeful and those with hope are 
most often optimistic.
The good news is that optimism can be learned. According to optimism 
expert Martin Seligman, anyone can change pessimistic views to optimistic 
ones. Seligman explains that an optimist
	
✓	Views disappointments as temporary
	
✓	Sees adversity as situational and not personal or enduring
	
✓	Looks at external causes of problems rather than blaming herself entirely
Pessimists, on the other hand, look at their misfortune as
	
✓	Permanent: “I never do anything right.”
	
✓	Pervasive: “Things go wrong in every part of my life.”
	
✓	Personal: “I am so stupid!”
If you’re a pessimist who wants to become an optimist, turn negative 
thoughts into positive ones:
	
✓	Remind yourself that you will have other opportunities to get things 
right.
	
✓	Realize that adversity does not spread throughout all aspects of your 
life. Sometimes things go well!
	
✓	Although not blaming yourself is difficult if your background includes 
others telling you that you’re an idiot, you can unlearn the habit. Look 
at the accomplishments in your life and realize that everyone makes 
mistakes.
Recognizing Emotions in Others
When you become self-aware and can handle your own feelings and motivate 
yourself, you’re ready to deal with the emotions of others. Timothy Leary 
famously advised people to “Turn on, tune in, drop out.” When it comes to 
emotions, you need to turn on, tune in, and drop in: turn on your emotional 
radar, tune in to other’s feelings, and drop in to their world.

138
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Tuning in — with a little help 
from the mirror neurons
You can tune into others’ emotions after you have your own feelings under 
control. Because the brain cannot multitask, you can’t focus on your own 
feelings and pay attention to someone else’s. Tuning in to what someone 
might be feeling and thinking is usually called empathy.
Some levels of empathy make others feel listened to and understood. When an 
individual thinks you understand her, her brain releases important chemicals. 
Those chemicals — dopamine, serotonin, and endorphins — cause the brain 
to feel pleasure and feel close to you. When you listen as well as you speak, col­
laboration with employees or customers becomes much easier. You can per­
suade people to see your point of view through these healthy collaborations.
Many believe that empathy is associated with mirror neurons. These groups 
of brain cells are located in the left hemisphere and connect when you 
watch someone perform a task. They connect to each other as though you’re 
performing the task rather than watching. Mirror neurons may go beyond 
physical tasks and make connections through emotional observations. These 
neurons basically read minds, or at least intentions.
When you see someone walking toward a car, your mirror neurons tell you 
that he’s going to open the door and get in. You would be shocked if the 
person smashed the window instead. In the same vein, if you observe some­
one upset over losing a loved one, you may get choked up; if you’ve been 
through a similar experience, you have a pattern for this kind of emotion 
stored in your brain. Those who have the most active mirror neuron systems 
tend to empathize more than those who do not.
Empathy and influence
Empathy enables you to feel what others are feeling. Using your empathic 
skills to help others feel listened to and understood offers you an opportu­
nity to wield your influence. Leadership expert John C. Maxwell points out, 
“People don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care.” 
Getting in touch with others’ feelings is the pathway to understanding their 
values, interests, desires, and needs.
Empathy enables leaders to make better decisions based not just on fact but 
on intuitive reasoning. You may believe you know what is best for those you 
lead, but without using your influence from the strong emotional connections 
you have made, you may be the only believer.

139
 Chapter 8: Assessing and Applying Your Emotional Intelligence
Empathy begins at home. Most babies respond to the cries in the nursery 
by crying themselves, an indication that they recognize emotions in others. 
Circuitry in the emotional brain combines information from facial expres­
sions, voice recognition, and body movement to help keep you attuned to 
others’ feelings.
	
Begin honing your empathy skills by observing facial expressions, tonality, 
and gestures or body language. Then compare what a person says to your 
observations to get an idea of what the person is feeling. This intense observa­
tion may cause you to have that same feeling or at least enable you to respond 
appropriately.
Leaders used to believe that they needed power and control, but they were 
wrong. Power comes from understanding relationships. Control belongs to 
every stakeholder. When you make others feel that they have some control 
over their lives and the power to make a difference, they follow your lead. 
The brain needs to feel in control, otherwise it would be constantly stressed.
Modeling the Emotion You Want to See
Emotions are contagious. Catch up with someone whose emotions are stron­
ger than yours, spend some time with them, and voila! You feel the same 
way. It’s not voodoo; it’s real.
Educators are experts at setting an emotional tone. Walk into a classroom 
in a neutral state and what do you get? Kids who don’t care. Walk in excited 
about your content, and you get students who can’t wait to learn. The same 
result occurs at a meeting. Team meetings, organizational meetings, and even 
client lunches need to be led by the emotionally attuned individual.
	
Observe friends or colleagues in a casual situation; you can see that their 
bodies tend to mirror each other after several minutes of chatting.
	
You can make an impact with your feelings both positively and negatively. 
Deep emotions tend to make the greatest impact, and negative emotions are 
more powerful than positive.
Studies have traced the flow of emotion from leader to subordinate. 
Researches used vehicles such as movie clips to initiate positive or negative 
moods, and then tracked leaders as they met with employees. The leader’s 
mood usually prevailed and spread. Before you step into your next meeting, 
check your crabbiness level.

140
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Consequences of spreading gloom or anger are easy to predict. Consider the 
following two scenarios.
	
✓	The grinning leader: You walk into your meeting with a smile from ear 
to ear. You greet others still flashing those pearly whites. What do your 
employees do? Smile right back at you. Viewing all of those smiles look­
ing at you makes the happiness escalate. The meeting is bound to be 
good with everyone in a positive mood.
	
✓	The glum leader: Doom and gloom have overcome you. You just lost 
an account and are very unhappy. Your meeting is scheduled, so you 
storm in. Your face shows anger or disgust. You look out at your audi­
ence. Of course, your subordinates react to the look on your face. They 
smile to try to change your emotional state. But their smiles infuriate 
you. After all, what are they smiling about? You just lost an account. 
Selling with empathy
Phillip arrived at the restaurant a few minutes 
early. He didn’t want to seem too eager, but 
he also didn’t want to keep Roger Reed wait­
ing. Rog had a reputation for leaving a meet­
ing if anyone was even a few minutes late. The 
deal in the works would make Phil’s month if it 
went through. Practice makes perfect, and Phil 
had been practicing his pitch for days. He was 
ready!
You could have knocked Phil over with a feather 
when Roger walked in with his wife screech­
ing in his ear. Holding the phone as close to his 
ear as he could to keep others from hearing, 
Roger attempted to calm her down. He said he 
was sorry for missing the golf luncheon at the 
club today. He had forgotten about it and had 
made this luncheon meeting with a prospective 
ad agency. Of course, he would never let this 
happen again. He begged for her forgiveness, 
hung up the phone, and turned with a glare 
toward Phil at the table.
Phil knew it was time to regroup. His pitch 
would have to be put aside until he got Roger 
in a better state of mind. Rog sat down with a 
growl, sat back, crossed his arms and stared at 
Phil. Phil slowly sat back, nodded at Rog, and 
said, “I had a dental appointment run late last 
week. My wife was freaking out because our 
daughter had a recital. Boy was I in trouble!” 
With that, Phil sighed and crossed his arms. 
Rog seemed to relax a bit at this confession.
“My wife is receiving an award for the Nine 
Hole Golf League. She wanted me to be there. 
It would be me and 75 women probably talk­
ing more about what they wear on the course 
than what clubs they use!” Rog laughed. He 
unfolded his arms and leaned forward. “What 
do you have for me, Phil?”
With this, Phil unfolded his arms, leaned for­
ward, and began his pitch. He was success­
ful at a process called mirroring. Seemingly 
unrelated to mirror neurons, mirroring another 
person’s actions can put breathing rate, heart 
rate, and possibly brain waves in sync. After 
they’re attuned in this way, people often feel 
they’re with their soul mate, someone who truly 
understands them.

141
 Chapter 8: Assessing and Applying Your Emotional Intelligence
You frown and their smiles fade. They’re thinking, “What’s wrong with 
him? What did I do? That son of a gun better not think I’m going to go 
out of my way for him.” Getting your message across at the meeting 
becomes a steep uphill battle.
When you cannot spread good feelings, get someone else to do it for you. 
Intense emotions may lead to circumstances that produce only negativity, an 
emotional environment you probably want to avoid.
Dealing with Out-of-Control Emotions
Even if you are able to recognize and deal with your emotions and the emo­
tions in those you live and work with and even if you’re a pro at motivating 
yourself and others, you’re going to have a few fluke moments. Sometimes, 
something happens and you discover that your emotions run away with you 
and from you.
The upcoming sections tell you about the way your brain reacts to these situ­
ations and what you can do to regain control.
When your emotional cool is hijacked
You’re cool, calm, and collected. You know your working environment; you 
understand your emotional triggers. Life is good. But out of nowhere, it hap­
pens. When you least expect it, an emotional surge overwhelms your brain, 
and your frontal lobe has no chance of suppressing it. Daniel Goleman, 
author of many books on emotional intelligence, calls this surprising rush 
an emotional hijacking. Your primitive emotional center, the amygdala, is so 
inundated that it takes over your brain. It causes a loss of control so over the 
top that when you come down you usually don’t remember what has hap­
pened. And you don’t understand what came over you.
Emotional hijacking may occur under circumstances such as when you
	
✓	Have been treated unfairly
	
✓	Have been insulted or disgraced
	
✓	Suffer a blow to your dignity
	
✓	Feel that your self-esteem is threatened
	
✓	Experience frustration or difficulty reaching a goal

142
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
Watch out for the (emotional) flood
Although emotional hijacking is problematic, occasional outbursts might 
be forgiven. They may even be an avenue toward improving your emotional 
intelligence skills. Reflecting on the situation and creating more positive 
responses is certainly helpful.
	
Sometimes hijacking leads to flooding — one hijack after another. Your allo­
static load is so great that you are flooded with emotion. Ever hypervigilant, 
your body is ready for the worst. Your heart rate is up, your respiration accel­
erates, and you feel you can’t get out of the way of your emotions. Responses 
become inappropriate, working at all becomes difficult, and if another hijack 
situation doesn’t arise, you simulate one of your own. You anticipate a situa­
tion before it occurs. You make the worst happen; you damage relationships, 
say things you might regret, and you lose the respect of your colleagues, 
coworkers, and employees.
Flooding is the worst-case scenario of not having a handle on your emotions. 
If you feel like you have been in control and things have been going smoothly, 
but suddenly you start to lose confidence, have difficulty being flexible, and 
feel stifled by indecision, examine what has happened in your life to cause 
these changes in you.
Rather than missing solutions to problems, losing the confidence of your 
employees, and feeling lousy for hours, remove yourself from any situation 
that causes a hijacking or flooding. Step back and see what in your environ­
ment has changed that causes such inappropriate emotional responses. 
Answer the following:
	
✓	Is your personal life under control? Although you think you have left 
your life at home, doing so is almost impossible. Check out what’s wrong 
and fix it.
	
✓	 What changes have occurred at work? Sometimes minor changes can 
put you on edge. Then when something goes wrong in a meeting or dis­
cussion, your already-stressed brain begins to overreact.
	
✓	Is someone higher up on the leadership ladder putting pressure on 
you? When your organization isn’t producing to the satisfaction of 
your board or investors, you probably begin each day more stressed 
than usual. Create a plan to solve the problem and keep yourself 
focused on following it.
	
✓	 Are you eating well and getting enough sleep? A lack of nutrients and/
or sleep produces stress. Your emotions are harder to control when you 
don’t properly care for your brain and body.

Decision-Making
In This Chapter
▶	Calling on brain and gut to make decisions
▶	Discovering the brain’s methods for deciding
▶	Bulking up your working memory
S
ome days, decision-making comes easily; on others, making up your 
mind isn’t just an effort but a seeming impossibility. Successful leader­
ship doesn’t allow you the luxury of procrastination. Certain crucial decisions 
require you to make up your mind on the spot. Of course, what your brain 
determines is crucial may not be to others, which presents another decision: 
Do you decide right away or take the time to gather more information?
You may urge yourself or others to “look rationally” at a decision. Guess 
what? The brain doesn’t work that way. You don’t make rational decisions 
unless you look at data, and I mean just the bottom line, and decide based 
solely on those numbers. The rest of your brain may be screaming for input, 
or quietly whispering something to you after you make the decision. Do 
you ignore that and leave your decision as is? That may be the best way for 
a leader to present herself as a confident, no-nonsense, and goal-oriented 
person in charge. But will your brain leave you alone?
Making good choices is a matter of gathering input from all areas of your 
brain. Let the executive brain mull things over with the emotional brain and 
choose based on the perceptions of both.
In this chapter you find out how to use cognition and emotions in decision-
making. You find out about the importance of working memory for combining 
information from different areas of your brain including your right and left 
hemispheres, your prefrontal cortex, and your emotions.

144
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
One Head, One Heart, Better Decisions
Thinking about your thinking is called metacognition, and it’s a uniquely 
human ability. Aristotle said that the rational mind had the responsibility 
of controlling the emotional mind so that it could be useful in the world. 
Considering your emotions may be key in making decisions.
Making choices: Got guts?
I have a gut feeling. 
I know it in my heart. 
I feel it in my bones.
Almost no one says anything like, “My brain is telling me . . .” or “I can feel it 
in my mind.” Although other parts get the credit, the feeling that you’re right 
originates in the emotional center of your brain.
Do you remember Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation? Just like Mr. 
Spock who preceded him, Data examined only the facts. Captain Kirk added 
the human touch, the emotional component. Data rattled off, well, data, and 
logically offered decisions. Having a Data on your team or inside your brain 
is good, and having Data work with Captain Kirk to form a combined rational/
emotional choice is even better.
You make decisions all day long. You make a choice about what to wear, what 
to eat, when to work, and when to play. Most of these choices are easy. (It’s 
casual Friday; I’ll wear jeans. I’m on a diet; I’ll eat a salad.) But when it comes 
to the tough choices, the ones you may not have a feeling for anywhere in your 
body, you have to make a choice about how to make the choice!
When you face a decision, your course of action may be one of the following:
	
✓	You don’t know what to do and so do nothing.
	
✓	You need to think about it.
	
✓	You know instinctively what to do, and you do it.
The upcoming sections describe ways to address each of these situations.
When you don’t know what to do
	
When you know what to do but don’t do it, you’re procrastinating. Doing noth­
ing when you don’t know what to do is different, but both of these situations 
end up with the same result. By not making a decision or not acting on one, 
you make a decision. Sometimes “deciding” by default can haunt you.

145
 Chapter 9: Thinking Your Way to the Top: Decision-Making
Can’t make up your mind about the new campaign? You do nothing, and you 
stay with the old campaign. Decision made. Don’t know whether to invest in 
that stock? Do nothing and you’re doing something — not buying that stock.
A good leader gathers great people around her to assist in decisions. It’s okay 
to sit back, give others some power, and see what happens. But you must be 
ready to step in if you feel their decisions won’t benefit your organization.
Thinking it through: Two types of decisions
Two kinds of decision-making strategies exist:
	
✓	Veridical decision-making is based on fact only.
	
✓	Adaptive decision-making is based on facts plus prior experience or 
emotions.
Some of the knowledge you have stored in your long-term memory consists 
of veridical knowledge. When you decide whether to pay with cash or credit 
card, the decision is made from a single answer as to how much money is in 
your account. Veridical decisions get you through most concrete problems 
that you deal with on a daily basis.
But most problems are somewhat ambiguous. Approaching fuzzy problems 
in a veridical fashion is difficult at best. Most leadership decisions are more 
adaptive in nature, and leaders must look at these problems from many dif­
ferent angles. When you decide whether to look for another employee for 
your accounting department, you have many angles to consider. Can you 
afford another salary? Can your current staff get the job done in a timely 
manner? Do you need specific expertise that you currently do not have?
As you run your organization, adaptive decision-making affects your produc­
tivity and your success. When making this type of decision, you consider the 
following aspects:
	
✓	Environment: What are the expectations of your company; how can 
your decision affect its culture and climate?
	
✓	Individuals: Will others be directly affected and need some input?
	
✓	Priorities: Will this decision be beneficial based on your current priorities?
	
✓	Consequences: Brainstorm all possible consequences. If they occur, was 
the decision too risky? Or is the risk acceptable?
The brain’s prefrontal cortex handles adaptive decision-making and execu­
tive functions like judgment. The prefrontal cortex can consider various 
aspects of a decision, look at the options, and make a choice. Most of this 
work occurs in an area of the prefrontal cortex called the orbito-frontal cortex, 
which is right behind the eyes. This structure combines emotions from the 

146
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
amygdala with rational thoughts about the problem. It also takes into con­
sideration the survival brain. Much of the adaptive decision-making process 
occurs without conscious knowledge.
Snap to it: Making decisions on the spot
Using your decision-making in an instant is sometimes called snap judgment, 
and it’s the focus of a lot of ongoing research. When you’re walking down 
the sidewalk and you see a piano falling from a window right above you, you 
don’t stop to think about your options. You just move quickly. That snap 
judgment works well for you.
Researchers are looking at where these decisions arise in the brain, and 
whether decisions that are made very quickly are as valid as decisions made 
using more time and analysis.
Dopamine is no dope
In Chapter 2, I show you how the neurotransmitter dopamine affects your 
reward system and attention system. Because it’s released for these two 
functions, dopamine is also very much involved in the decision-making pro­
cess. The anterior cingulate cortex, the ACC, guides your brain into decisions 
based on your experiences and the outcomes of prior decision-making. When 
something goes wrong, the dopamine neurons in the ACC become active 
trying to figure out why.
Dopamine neurons remember and learn from past experiences. Have you 
ever been on a cruise and gotten seasick? Seasickness is the result of your 
dopamine neurons having certain expectations of how your body responds in 
space, and then being surprised by the motion of the ocean. A sensory con­
flict begins and, until the dopamine neurons “learn” to change for the motion, 
you feel sick.
	
You can make technical decisions using veridical decision making, but you 
need to use adaptive thinking to make leadership decisions. Adaptive thinking 
requires feelings. Dopamine is essential for making the connections between 
higher-level thinking and emotional thinking.
Dopamine works in two ways:
	
✓	 In the prefrontal cortex, dopamine inhibits unnecessary and unwanted 
thoughts from the focus of the problem.
	
✓	 In the reward system, dopamine remembers what works and what made 
you feel good, as well as what didn’t work and brought you no reward.

Most people envision the CEO of a large company residing in the penthouse 
suite and working on the top floor of the building in an enormous office sur­
rounded by windows that take in a beautiful view. The CEO of your brain, the 
frontal lobe, has a similar setting. It resides at the highest level of your brain, 
takes up quite a bit of brain geography, and has a view of the world like no 
other. 
The frontal lobe is where decisions are made. Your rise to leadership 
depended on your frontal lobe abilities. But your frontal lobe didn’t work 
alone. The interaction among many brain areas and the emotional center 
enabled you to work with others, handle relationships with clients and other 
employees, organize, plan, and make decisions.
Train your brain, change your life. You did this through your experiences, 
your relationships, your reflective thinking, and your ability to work with 
your emotions and feelings rather than against them or letting them run the 
show. When you decide, you can base your decision on intuition, a more 
automatic process, or use a more analytical and reflective method. Both are 
overseen by the frontal lobe, in particular that prefrontal cortex.
Time is a factor in decision-making. Whether you have to make a spur-of-the-
moment decision or you have time for researching, analyzing, and consulting 
others affects your decision. Many people had to make split-second decisions 
during the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Some became helpless; 
they couldn’t decide what to do because time was limited. Others became 
leaders and took care of the helpless; they used their feelings to create 
actions. After those events, many people changed their decision-making pro­
cesses because they looked at the world differently. They took a “life is too 
short” attitude, and as a result some of their short-term decisions were made 
from a different perspective, and some of their goals were changed.
Giving yourself time to decide
Whenever you face a decision, the problem or decision comes to the attention 
of the reticular activating system (RAS) in the brain stem. If you need to attend 
to the problem or are interested in solving it, the dilemma is transmitted up 
to your amygdala, the brain’s emotional center, where you begin to feel uncer­
tain, afraid, frustrated, or angry. If you don’t act on those negative feelings 
right away, you have a chance to examine the issue at a higher brain level. 
The frontal lobe and the prefrontal cortex take over.

Give yourself ten seconds for the predicament to get up to the brain’s execu­
tive areas and apply some logic to the issue. By doing so, you suppress those 
overwhelming negative emotions, and so you don’t act without some reflec­
tion but take those feelings into account as you analyze, devise a plan, orga­
nize your resources, determine possible consequences, and then share your 
decision.
Becoming more aware of your body’s responses to stress helps you control 
your emotions and take them into consideration along with your rational 
thoughts as you consider an issue.
For instance, Keith operates a chain of stores that cater to runners. Running 
is big business. He sells the top brands that many runners stay with year after 
year. He also sells walking shoes, aerobic shoes, and cross-training shoes. To 
keep overhead low, his stores are not in the most fashionable parts of town. 
Sometimes he opens a store near a university to get the college runners, but 
even then he saves money in rent by staying off the beaten path. Because his 
stores are out of the way and in older neighborhoods that are run down, the 
sale of soft goods like walking and aerobic shoes is slowing down. He hates to 
lose this part of the business, but he has to make a decision.
Because he doesn’t have to make the decision in a hurry, Keith can look at 
different aspects of the problem and even do some research. His gut tells him 
it’s time to focus only on running, because that part of his business is doing 
so well, but his head keeps counting the profit on those other kinds of ath­
letic shoes.
Keith can follow a typical decision-making format similar to the one that follows:
	
1.	Define the situation and the decision to be made.
	
	 Bottom line is bottoming out on shoes other than running shoes, possibly 
because of the stores’ locations. Drop the lines or change the locations?
	
2.	Identify the important criteria for the process and the result.
	
	 Sales in running shoes continue to rise. Aerobic and walking shoes used 
to sell well enough to stock, and they provide a good profit margin, but 
people — especially women — are reluctant to shop in the neighbor­
hoods where Keith’s stores are located.
	
3.	Consider all possible solutions.
	
	 Keith’s solutions include the following:
 
• Carry only running shoes and accessories, which may save money 
because Keith will need fewer employees.

149
 Chapter 9: Thinking Your Way to the Top: Decision-Making
 
• Remain in current locations with low overhead.
 
• Change locations, pay higher overhead, and hope for larger market 
share in other products.
 
• Add an Internet storefront.
 
• Try moving one store and measuring the results after one year. If 
the profit is great enough, consider moving other stores.
	
4.	Calculate the consequences of these solutions versus the likelihood of 
satisfying the criteria.
	
	 Keith faces the following possible outcomes:
 
• Moving can be difficult and time consuming, and it doesn’t guaran­
tee that business in soft departments will increase.
 
• Dropping the soft lines means risking losing some impulse buying 
on the part of runners’ family members or runners who want a 
second pair of more casual shoes for another purpose. Some 
employees could be cut, and those salaries would help balance the 
loss of sales.
 
• Selling on the Internet would provide a whole new market. A tech­
nology person would have to be added to the payroll. Sales could 
increase.
 
• Moving one store is a financial risk, but it’s not as big a risk as 
moving all of them. Employees would remain the same.
	
5.	Choose the best option.
	
	 Get assistance from others if you need more input. You want to come to 
a decision that matches your values and your finances, so take whatever 
steps you can to calculate the risks.
Keith chose to move a single store to a new location. The rent is about 30 
percent higher than he currently pays, but he hopes to make up the differ­
ence in sales. Because he has never operated in an upscale area, he is curi­
ous whether overall sales will increase. He has overridden his gut feeling, but 
he’s taking a small risk instead of a big one. He decided taking a chance might 
even change the look of his business and an expansion in product lines if he 
gets more traffic.
Often, decision-making breeds further decision-making. To act on his deci­
sion, Keith must choose a location. But he has the time to check the demo­
graphics and figure out where to make his first move.

Deciding in the blink of an eye
Split-second decision-making, which doesn’t happen often in the business 
world, follows a different pattern in the brain. Your RAS is alerted because 
your brain anticipates a survival situation. Information goes up to the 
limbic brain, where emotional reactions occur. Chemicals released as the 
fight-or-flight response begins increase blood flow to your extremities. With 
less blood flow to your brain, your thinking might also be interrupted. Mild 
though the fight-or-flight response may be in such instances, it takes place 
when you face a novel challenge that has time constraints. Your heart beats 
a bit more rapidly and your head begins to swim. You decide to go with 
your gut and make a decision based on the emotions the current environ­
ment and conditions inspire.
When you rely on your gut, do you make a good decision or a bad one? In his 
book Blink, Malcolm Gladwell explains that you may have made a very good 
decision. Your gut has some very good information. Some studies suggest that 
making a decision over time using analytical strategies is not better than rely­
ing on your gut feelings and making quick choices based on those feelings.
No gut, no glory
Tony is the vice president in charge of new 
product creation at a software company. His 
job is very demanding as he has to keep pro­
ducing cutting-edge software. The latest proj­
ect Tony’s section is working on is security 
software for large corporation networks. The 
normal procedure is to take a beta version of 
the software and install it onto a few nones­
sential computers and run a proof of concept 
trial run, during which users compare the new 
software to the old software to see whether 
the new product is easier to use, requires less 
technical support, and provides better security.
A large customer of Tony’s company reported 
a major breach in its current security system. 
Because the breaches were getting out of con­
trol with the old software they demanded new 
security software immediately or they would 
switch to a new vender. Tony had to decide 
whether to release the beta version of the 
new security software or lose this customer to 
another vender. If the software works, he would 
be a hero and would have saved the account. If 
it doesn’t work, he will lose the account. But he 
will lose them anyway if he doesn’t have some­
thing to offer them right now. Tony took the 
risk for the company. Although it was a quick 
decision, Tony had that gut feeling, based on 
his previous experiences, that this would work. 
And if it didn’t, he had a bit more time to come 
up with something else.

151
 Chapter 9: Thinking Your Way to the Top: Decision-Making
	
Your gut feelings come from years of experience at making decisions and 
using critical thinking skills. When your brain stores all of the choices you’ve 
made and their consequences, you have a huge file of information from which 
to choose. What seems like a snap judgment is really based on your experi­
ences and the wisdom from them.
Working Memory: Bigger Is Better
Your brain lets you to store your previous experiences, learn from your mis­
takes and successes, and to learn from the mistakes of others. What enables 
you to juggle all of those situations including the results? Your wonderful 
working memory.
In this section you find out how to increase your working memory power. 
The bigger your working memory becomes, the better able you are to con­
sider more options for your decisions.
Making up your brain
Working memory — the process that enables you to hold information in your 
brain for a brief period of time — enables you to manage the activity of the 
outside world and the activity inside your brain.
Think of working memory as a sheet of paper. You are asked to make a deci­
sion regarding your business. You write the situation on the paper. Then 
you go through a decision-making process such as the one that Keith used in 
the section “Giving yourself time to decide.” All of the information from your 
decision-making process goes onto that sheet of paper. Perhaps new informa­
tion comes into the picture. Onto the paper it goes. You begin to think about 
prior decisions you’ve made that apply to this issue. Onto the paper they go. 
Then you think about what someone else might do in this situation: a famous 
executive like Bill Gates, your father, or a friend of yours. Those names and 
the thoughts you have about them go onto the paper as well.
Your working memory (sometimes called scratch pad memory) is like this 
sheet of paper, and it has a lot to hold. When you have the luxury of writing 
things down from your working memory (as you do when you have time to 
consider a decision), you empty your working memory to allow more infor­
mation to enter.

152
Part II: Tapping Into the Brain of a Leader 
But what about those rush decisions? The ones that don’t allow you time 
to write anything down? Even when you’re deciding on the fly, you still go 
through the decision-making process; you just have to do it all in your head. 
Working solely in your head requires more space in your working memory, 
or enough stored experiences in your brain to hook to the vital information 
that can help you make your decision. That scratch pad in your head has to 
be big enough to consider the information, your prior experiences, and what 
others might do. You start to juggle the information as though you are jug­
gling balls:
	
✓	Ball 1 is the problem or situation.
	
✓	Ball 2 might be how the decision can affect you, your employees, the 
bottom line, and so on.
	
✓	Consider Ball 3 the way this situation compares to others you have 
been in.
	
✓	Oops, where were we? Ball 4 — what would daddy do?
If your working memory is large enough, you can examine all of these 
thoughts without losing any of the balls. You increase your working memory 
by working your working memory!
You’re a busy person, of course, but if you always write things down, if you 
never memorize numbers but have them programmed into your phone, or if 
your assistant reminds you of every appointment, then you are not working 
your working memory. You cannot increase your memory without using it. 
Remember as a student you had to memorize poetry, preambles, and amend­
ments? That exercise was good for your memory.
Practice the following memory-building strategies:
	
✓	Play memory games. For example, place a deck of cards face down, and 
then turn over two at a time, looking for pairs. Try to remember each 
card you look at so that when you turn a card that has the same number 
on it, you easily find its match.
	
✓	Do mental math. Forget the calculator for a while. 
	
✓	Try to remember the names, occupations, and personal information of 
new people you meet.
Living in the past
Your past situations and decisions stay with you. You rely on the results of 
some decisions to help you in the future. Much of the time those experiences 
enable you to make good or better decisions right now.

153
 Chapter 9: Thinking Your Way to the Top: Decision-Making
But you can’t live in the past. The world has changed too much. Do you want 
your heart surgeon to use the methods and decisions he made 20 years ago 
on you today? Probably not.
People use the past to assist with the present and predict the future. But get­
ting stuck in the past is disastrous for leaders. Living in the past can leave you 
stuck. Leadership is about change. For change, you have to look to the future.
Deciding for the future
Leaders who always focus on the present may stagnate. The leader who 
focuses on the future, stays on the cutting edge, takes some risk, and makes 
decisions based on possibilities. She has ideas that no one else has, and they 
may not necessarily be the most popular ideas. Leaders know that if they do 
something, if they make a decision, then something will happen. They count 
on that something to be positive, exciting. lucrative, and challenging.
Leaders make decisions based on wisdom from the past, knowledge from the 
present, and hope for the future. They use their gut feelings to guide their 
rational thoughts.
Wishy-washy leadership won’t work
Your decisions affect more than just yourself. 
Max is the owner and chief pilot of a small 
fixed-base operation (FBO — a service center 
for planes and pilots) at a large airport. Max 
has trouble keeping good employees, from his 
mechanics and electronics people, to his flight 
line and office personnel. Max prides himself in 
keeping up with what’s going on in the indus­
try. He reads all the aviation management peri­
odicals and belongs to an aviation managers’ 
association. 
Every time Max is inspired by an article or 
swayed by a fellow owner’s idea, he creates 
new rules or systems that sound like they would 
help the business run smoother, but he usually 
replaces his latest and greatest within a few 
months with an even newer idea — if it didn’t 
fail in the first few weeks from lack of guidance. 
Employees bet on when Max’s next change of 
heart will come. Max once took down the avia­
tion memorabilia and painted the customer 
waiting area pink trying to make the room look 
more modern. He surveyed some of the char­
ter customers afterwards, and they said they 
enjoyed the old memorabilia because the room 
was like a museum, and that made it less boring 
to wait. Max changed it back. Max also con­
stantly changed the weather minimums under 
which a flight could fly. Employees couldn’t tell 
whether these changes were based on profit or 
safety.
Max’s lack of focus and indecisive leadership 
creates an environment that’s too unstable. 
His indecisiveness makes the predictability 
element that the brain loves impossible, and 
hence, his employees are uneasy, and few of 
them stick around.

A
 leader enables her current staff members to excel. 
In this part, I show you how to bring out the best in 
your workers, including how to create an environment 
that primes them for success, and how to overcome 
differences — in brains, communication style, generation, 
and opinion, to name a few. 
You also find out how best to add new members to your 
team, and how to support and encourage the teams 
you lead.

In This Chapter
▶	Using diversity to your advantage
▶	Finding positive ways to harness stress
▶	Keeping toxic attitudes at bay
▶	Nudging employees toward greatness
A
s I point out in Chapter 4, a leader’s job is to bring out the best in her 
employees. You may have exactly the people you need to meet your 
goals and fulfill your mission. Helping your current employees excel makes 
your organization stronger and more productive. All of the different brains 
in your organization bring their own experiences and abilities to help solve 
problems, make decisions, and move your organization toward its goals.
Meeting face-to-face with each member of your organization helps you dis­
cover who’s really following your lead. Leaders need followers, but some­
times not everyone is in step with you. You face the hard decision of whether 
to keep or fire employees who aren’t helping fulfill your vision. You can avoid 
some of the stress of letting people go by discovering more about them, 
teaching them more about the organization, and helping them become the 
employees you need.
At every organization, you find toxic people who may cause a ripple effect 
that spreads negativity. Just like other emotions, negativity can be conta­
gious. You need to seek out the toxic people and determine whether they 
understand your vision, agree with your values, and want to work on the mis­
sion in a positive, encouraging way. Making clear to everyone that you expect 
positive, encouraging behavior is particularly important if you have team 
leaders who have become part of that negative crowd.
In this chapter, you find out how different brains work together, how stress 
affects your mission, how to deal with toxic people, and how to help good 
employees develop into great ones.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
No Two Brains Are Alike: 
Working with Differences
There has never been a brain like yours and there never will be. This state­
ment tells you how special you really are — and that everyone with whom 
you work is just as special. Your experiences, diet, sleep, genetics, environ­
ments, hobbies, career, and all that you do go into making your brain unique.
Understanding the uniqueness of each of your employees helps you under­
stand how they function best and how you can bring out the best in them.
If employees grow, so does your business
What keeps employees from excelling? Opportunity? Fear? Complacency? 
Or you? Mike owns a profitable business, and he does well because he does 
it all. His employees are perfectly capable, but Mike has two concerns: He 
doesn’t want to train his people for fear they will then leave and find another 
place to work, and he needs to micromanage. Mike doesn’t believe anything 
can be done without him.
As a result of his attitude, he loses employees. They leave because he doesn’t 
make them feel valued. But Mike is happy that he hasn’t trained them for 
anyone else. Mike is so concerned that his business can’t succeed without 
him that he doesn’t take time off, which — according to his ex-wife — led to 
their divorce.
If Mike made his employees feel important and valued, they would stay. If 
Mike trusted his people to do the right thing and trained them according to 
his vision and values, they would stay and grow. They would feel that they’re 
a part of something and can make a difference.
If you want your employees to excel and your business to prosper as a result, 
do the following:
	
✓	Keep them growing. Use on-the-job training, provide onsite professional 
development, and send them to offsite trainings.
	
✓	Let them know you value them. Acknowledge each individual’s work 
and point out the connection between their work and the company’s 
goals.
	
✓	Create a learning environment. Keep stress low, and ask team mem­
bers to shadow other workers to get a complete understanding of how 
the organization runs.

159
 Chapter 10: Enabling Your Current Employees to Excel
	
✓	Build trust. Emphasize the skills of each team and team member so 
employees feel confident that their own work is in good hands.
	
✓	Build relationships. Get to know your employees on a deeper level. Use 
the emotional intelligence training from Chapter 8 to reach them. Help 
them build and maintain relationships among themselves.
	
✓	Have fun. Encourage employees to socialize; make the work day more 
fun by adding humor and telling stories.
	
✓	Appreciate their differences. Types of intelligence, sex, and genera­
tional differences are part of what makes everyone unique. Accepting 
and valuing these differences in order to celebrate employees’ contribu­
tions creates a better place to work.
The outcome of any endeavor depends largely on the perception that each 
employee has of your vision. Often, leaders share their vision using emotions, 
facts, and symbolic language and then assume that everyone has received the 
same message and has the same big picture of what the organization is about.
	
Find a happy medium with each employee. Some want your input on a regular 
basis; others don’t want to hear from you and can come to you when their 
project is complete. Make sure you can live with what you decide works best 
for you and each employee. Even though you may not be a delegative leader, 
some people need free rein to become creative and feel in control.
If you’re like Mike — afraid of losing well-trained employees to other compa­
nies — look into the possibility of a non-compete clause in their contracts 
that can keep them from working for a competitor for six months if they leave 
your business.
If you’re new to a leadership position, review what you need to know about 
each employee. The human resource person, team leaders, and personal 
conversations can provide you with a wealth of information. It may take both 
intrinsic and extrinsic rewards to keep employees happy. The extrinsic, or 
external, rewards can be monetary or other perks to show your appreciation 
of a job well-done. Intrinsic motivation, that internal feeling of knowing you 
have done a good job, may be even more important. Show your appreciation 
for jobs well-done by offering verbal or written feedback.
Using differences to your advantage
When you work with employees who have different intelligences, their 
points of view on problem-solving or their approaches to projects may differ. 
Respecting and acknowledging those differences can increase creativity and 

160
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
productivity. Presenting basic information may begin a series of suggestions, 
or because of the differing views, employees may hold back waiting for a 
request for their input.
	
Seek approaches to your projects and solutions to problems from employees. 
Multiple answers provide choices for you and for your employees. You will be 
meeting the need that the brain has for choices as well as honoring diversity.
Get employees talking — to you, to each other, and to their teams. If like-
minded people are always interacting with each other, no one is going to 
change his mind. Get over the idea that everyone loves to collaborate. The 
brain is social and likes to interact with other brains, but collaboration is a 
skill that can be learned. Here are some ideas for how you get people talking:
	
✓	Share the topic and why it’s important.
	
✓	Explain what you hope to take away from the conversation.
	
✓	Lead the conversation. Someone has to begin; it’s easiest if you find the 
starting point.
	
✓	Be honest about how the conversation is going; share your feelings 
throughout the conversation.
	
✓	Ask others to share how they feel about the conversation, but don’t 
hesitate to step in and redirect the conversation if it gets off track.
	
✓	Keep saying “thank you.” Every comment deserves a response, and 
“thank you” is safe. If you say “good point” to one person, you have to 
say that to everyone or you’ll slowly stop the conversation. Show that 
you are grateful to them for sharing.
Create diverse conversations by making sure that friends are separated. 
Encourage confrontation. Get employees to share their feelings. One method 
to get the ball rolling is to simply have these diverse groups brainstorm 
words that they would use to describe the company, what other people 
might say about it, and what the customers are saying. It doesn’t matter 
whether they’re positive or negative, let the thoughts flow and get them 
posted on a white board or flip chart. After they jot down thoughts in one big 
list, ask them to separate them into positive and negative thoughts. Discuss 
that negative list first. Then see if everyone agrees on the positive. Ask each 
group to come up with more positives that they would like to be able to say 
about the company. You may be redesigning your vision, but if it makes 
everyone more productive, perhaps it is time to do just that.
	
Encouraging confrontation and the sharing of feelings works only if people feel 
safe, so try these ideas:

161
 Chapter 10: Enabling Your Current Employees to Excel
	
✓	Focus only on facts. Leave personalities out of the conversation.
	
✓	Ask questions, and keep accusations out of the conversation.
	
✓	Begin on a positive note.
	
✓	Get everyone involved in finding solutions.
Discovering How Stress Makes a Mess
Within every organization — or for that matter, every group of people or 
animals — a hierarchy forms. Wanting to know who’s in charge is part of 
human nature. Some therapists believe that the youngest child in a family 
wields the power. And I believe that you’re only as happy as your unhap­
piest child. Could that be true in business as well? Your most unhappy 
employee may well cause enough stress and negativity to bring the rest of 
your team down. Business has a formal hierarchy, but social hierarchies 
develop within the formal structure.
Utilizing stress at the top
As a hierarchy develops, someone takes the top spot. This person has the 
power to influence others and may well be your best employee. A true leader 
may have emerged to lead others to your vision.
The person at the top of the hierarchy experiences positive stress — the kind 
that drives you to accomplish things. Positive stress enhances memory and 
people skills, and it enables you to feel the emotions necessary to win and to 
achieve.
Positive stress is a tool for getting things done. A little rush of adrenaline that 
gets the heart beating faster and puts employees in action can go a long way 
to getting things done. Try some of the following strategies to increase and 
harness positive stress:
	
✓	Set short-term goals. Time limits increase stress levels but only 
enough to create positive responses in those who are equipped to 
meet the goals.
	
✓	Offer incentives. The promise of a reward gets those stress juices 
flowing.
	
✓	Promise new learning. Some employees experience positive stress 
when they get excited about a doable challenge.

162
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
	
Most research shows that money is not the reason people work for an organi­
zation. The reason is they share the organization’s vision.
Combating negative stress at the bottom
Where there’s a top, there’s also a bottom. Being at the bottom of the heap 
affects the brain in many not-so-pleasant ways. Take a look at the following 
common progression of problems for the employee feeling stress from being 
the low man on the totem pole:
	
✓	Feeling uninvolved, unwanted, kept in the dark, constantly reprimanded, 
useless, or helpless may induce chronic stress.
	
✓	Chronic stress may lead to an inability to think clearly and to health 
problems.
	
✓	Health problems may lead to absenteeism.
	
✓	Absenteeism means the job isn’t getting done.
	
✓	Returning to work after an illness may cause additional stress because 
work has progressed and the employee doesn’t feel informed.
	
✓	This new stress may cause further health problems.
And so on and on and on. . . .
Because stress is a response to a survival mechanism, another scenario is 
common for the employee on the bottom of the hierarchy. The reflexive or 
reactive part of the brain that includes the brain stem and the emotional area 
of the brain, the limbic system, acts to protect you because it doesn’t know 
the difference between physical stress and emotional stress. Such action may 
cause the following kinds of unconscious thought and harmful actions:
	
✓	Being at the bottom of the heap makes the person feel inadequate.
	
✓	Whenever the person “on top” asserts her authority, this person feels 
even more insecure and inadequate.
	
✓	This person may feel that everyone on the team knows his rank and be 
embarrassed by it.
	
✓	In order to avoid scrutiny of any kind, this person works to make the 
one on top look inadequate.
	
✓	The person creates a situation in which the top dog can’t continue her 
work, thus shifting negative attention from the bottom to the top.

Is there room at the top?
Include your employees in the glory and the 
profits to keep them feeling important and expe­
riencing less stress.
John and Lois work hard to keep their e-busi­
ness going. It began with a few creative ideas 
dealing with baby gifts. As young parents, 
the couple realized how excited they were 
to receive clothing and other items with their 
baby’s name on them. Through a larger online 
company that would produce the items, John 
and Lois opened their e-store. They designed 
and created until the wee hours of the morn­
ing while they kept their day jobs and parented 
their children. It was a labor of love, and it was 
exhausting. But their efforts paid off. Soon 
the business was making enough profit that 
Lois could quit her day job and split her time 
between the children and the business. John 
continued to work evenings on the business 
after the kids went to bed.
Life was good. Until things changed. The 
e-business that made and mailed their orders 
changed its way of doing business. The per­
centage this company now wanted left John 
and Lois with a mere 10 percent profit. The 
company also wanted to standardize the price 
of items in each of its e-stores. As John and 
Lois saw their dream of an ongoing business 
that offered a service to parents, grandparents, 
aunts, and uncles going down the drain, they 
were distraught. And then they found Jeremy. 
Jeremy had a small shop that made many of the 
kinds of items that John and Lois sold. Jeremy 
could produce and mail the orders just as the 
e-company had done. It would cost more, but 
in the long run and with plenty of volume, John 
and Lois could still offer their service and make 
a living.
It worked. John and Lois began to see their 
income rise. Orders came in quickly, and 
Jeremy filled them as fast as they came in. 
Because the business was unique, it attracted 
press attention and was featured in a story 
about Internet “mom and pop” stores. John 
and Lois were interviewed, photographed along 
with their products, and even made an appear­
ance on television. After all of the hoopla, they 
noticed that a few customers complained that 
their orders hadn’t come as quickly as in the 
past. Jeremy began to fall behind. It was true 
that business was growing, so John asked 
Jeremy if he needed more money to hire 
someone else to take care of the load. Jeremy 
refused. He complained that people were just 
whiners. He was angry and sometimes hostile. 
John and Lois offered to buy the business from 
Jeremy, so they could hire others to do the 
work. Jeremy refused.
Just as John and Lois were considering finding 
another business to replace Jeremy, it dawned 
on Lois what had happened. Jeremy wasn’t 
included in any of the publicity. John and Lois 
had taken all of the credit for their wonderful 
business. In reality, Jeremy had done a great 
deal. The vision and mission and goals of the 
store remained the same, but Jeremy had to be 
moved to the top. John and Lois made a new 
arrangement with Jeremy, who would hence­
forth be included in any promotions that were 
done. His name and bio were placed on the 
Web site along with John’s and Lois’s. Jeremy 
began to promote the products himself, and 
the three found that Jeremy’s knowledge of 
what went into production was impressive to 
customers. Jeremy moved up and shared the 
top. His stress levels dropped; his enthusiasm 
soared.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
This scenario isn’t pretty, but it happens universally. You probably remember 
someone in your elementary school being the class clown. That child may have 
been bright, but he just didn’t catch on to many things. The class clown’s job 
was to get the teacher off her task of teaching because teaching made him feel 
stupid. He thinks that if the teacher isn’t teaching, even if he gets into trouble 
as a result, he’s not looking stupid. He looks instead like he doesn’t care, and 
he entertains the class because he believes they will like him for it.
At work, this scenario may play out a bit differently. Your team is preparing 
for a launch of a new product. One employee feels that he has been over­
looked for a special position on the team. Because he feels he won’t receive 
proper credit for the work he has done, he wants to sabotage the project 
in some way. He disrupts each team meeting with questions and concerns 
about the launch. He argues with a few of the team members over details.
What happens if you fire or transfer the person on the bottom? If you think 
life will be good then, you may be greatly mistaken. You see, someone has to 
be on the bottom. The question is, how do you fix this? Can you make every­
one equal? Yes. If the team can clearly see your vision and share it with you. 
If every single member can get on board with your mission and has the same 
values that your company has, and is willing to take this journey together, 
then the hierarchy may not be a problem. You have to realize that you 
cannot do it alone and you need to make every member of your organization 
a member of your team.
	
Not everyone is unhappy at the bottom of the hierarchy. Many people don’t 
want the stress of trying to climb their way to the top. They do their jobs so 
that they make a living and can participate in whatever hobbies or interests 
they enjoy. They retire happily with their pension, and may be better off for 
doing so.
Neutralizing Toxic People
Toxic people are those people in your life who are so negative that they drain 
you of your energy and make you miserable, but for some reason you either 
feel forced to be around them or think you can change them. It’s bad enough 
when they infect your personal life, but when they infect your business, your 
employees, and your future, it’s time to detox.
Recognizing toxicity in the workplace
Because negativity and toxicity spread like germs in the workplace, you need 
to recognize the characteristics of the toxic worker. Watch for the following 
signs that a toxic person is on your staff:

165
 Chapter 10: Enabling Your Current Employees to Excel
	
✓	Gossip: From the water cooler to the washroom, the toxic person talks 
about others at work to whomever will listen.
	
✓	Unconstructive criticism: He can do it better, would have done it 
another way, or doesn’t believe it should ever have been done.
	
✓	Drama queens: Her life is a mess! She couldn’t get the work done 
because her dog ate it!
	
✓	Drama kings: No one understands him; he’s highly creative but can’t let 
it out in this environment.
	
✓	Bitterness: Because she wasn’t asked to be on the project; she tells 
everyone that the project is beneath her.
	
✓	Constant complaining: The environment stinks; the lighting’s not good; 
the equipment is archaic.
	
✓	Blaming others: The project would have been successful if a certain 
someone hadn’t been involved; it’s not her fault.
Describing the ripple effect
If your employees listen to a toxic person’s negativity enough, they leave 
your company or succumb to the toxicity. (If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.) 
Joining the toxic person adds fuel to her fire.
	
What does this toxicity do to your workplace? The more negative the work 
environment becomes, the more likely you are to see
	
✓	Lower productivity
	
✓	Lower emotional intelligence
	
✓	More time spent soothing feelings
	
✓	Lack of enthusiasm
	
✓	Loss of interest in your vision
	
✓	More interest in personal agendas
	
✓	Loss of key employees
Fortunately, the ripple effect works both ways. Just as negativity spreads 
throughout the company, so too can a positive attitude. If your employees 
know that you are going to look into this problem and do something about it, 
they will be willing to work with you. Let them know you will find the source 
of the contamination and do whatever it takes to get back the positive envi­
ronment that you desire.

166
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Detoxing brains
Discovering what makes people toxic is the key to creating a better work 
environment. Anytime a person feels so uncomfortable that he needs to 
be toxic in order to function, he is in a survival mode. The fight or flight 
response is in effect.
A toxic person’s behavior interferes with her own work and the work of 
others. The following are some possible causes of toxicity:
	
✓	Not understanding the company’s vision
	
✓	Having become disconnected from the purpose of the organization
	
✓	An unfulfilled need to connect with others
	
✓	Nonexistent emotional intelligence skills
	
✓	Not knowing what you expect
	
✓	Problems at home
	
✓	Feeling underappreciated
To begin detoxing your business, work to uncover the root problems of the 
negativity. You do so by opening the lines of communication. Speak indi­
vidually with each person who is bringing negativity to the workplace, and 
speak to those who are caught in that negativity and may be spreading it as a 
result. Take the time to find out what they feel is expected of them and reiter­
ate your expectations. Clarify and emphasize your vision. Show them where 
they fit into your vision and your mission. Find out how things are for them 
at home. Offer counseling or other resources if the problem does stem from 
somewhere outside the office.
	
After you have face-to-face conversations with the toxic people in your com­
pany, meet with each team or department. Review your vision and your mis­
sion at the beginning of every meeting. If you find that additional employees 
are not in sync with your purpose and do not know where they fit in, begin 
individual meetings with everyone, both toxic and nontoxic. Make your pres­
ence known throughout your organization. Be present. Observe. Listen.
As you look for solutions, note that you may be part of the problem. Are you 
modeling the behavior you want to see? Are your words or actions negative? 
Meet with the executive team and discuss the problem. Make sure that they 
have an opportunity to speak up if they’re having difficulty with expectations, 
purpose, or next steps.

167
 Chapter 10: Enabling Your Current Employees to Excel
A coaching or mentoring program (see Chapter 4) may help you fight toxic­
ity. Although such a program can make a difference, approach coaching toxic 
people warily. Problem employees may or may not be good candidates for 
coaching. Choose wisely.
	
Just as toxic people spread their negativity in the workplace, they may also 
spread it to their mentors. Choose strong mentors who understand the prob­
lem. Be certain that the mentors have strong positive attitudes and can 
explain to the toxic mentee that he’s valued and how he fits into the vision 
and mission of the organization.
Offer each employee a chance to join you in your mission. Leading people 
where they already want to go is easy. Those who aren’t willing to work up 
to your expectations and who get in the way of those who do must really be 
looking for a different vision. Give them the opportunity to find it elsewhere.
Moving Them from Good to Great
Good employees are not hard to find. You already have good employees. Great 
employees are like great leaders: they aren’t born but made. Sometimes you 
inherit employees as you take over a leadership position. Rather than replac­
ing workers with others who don’t know the company, you may be better off 
evaluating their strengths and weaknesses and helping them develop the skills 
that you need. If you’re dealing with a company that isn’t performing and you 
have been given the awesome opportunity to recreate the company or, at least, 
get them up to speed, some major changes may be in order. You have the 
opportunity to bring out the best in everyone you lead.
Developing people
The only person you can really change is yourself. If you’ve been trying to 
change a spouse or a loved one, you probably know this to be true. But when 
it comes to employees, certainly you can offer the opportunity for change.
In any of my positions, I always feel my job is to reach people where they are 
and then help them stretch.
Setting the bar is better than bellying up to the bar
Creating a warm and friendly atmosphere helps the brain feel secure. Many 
people view socializing with employees off site as beneficial. But when it 
comes down to it, your employees need to know what your expectations 

168
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
are and whether they can meet them. Setting the bar and making sure they 
understand what exactly you expect of them is an important step in helping 
employees grow in their jobs.
Because leaders have stored in their memories what they want others to 
do, they may expect their employees and team leaders to also know. Many 
people make this mistake. Think about proofreading a speech or an article. 
When you proofread yourself, you often miss errors or omissions. This is 
because your brain fills in the blanks from your memory banks. Others who 
proofread can spot these mistakes right away.
	
Expecting employees to read your mind isn’t an option. Make your expecta­
tions clear. Write them down and review them during meetings and personal 
conferences for reinforcement and for change.
Setting the bar requires contact with employees. Some suggestions for this 
include:
	
✓	Yearly retreats at which time everyone gets the big picture and employ­
ees gain a greater understanding of goals and expectations
	
✓	Semi-annual or quarterly planning meetings with team leaders to rein­
force expectations
	
✓	One-on-one meetings with your direct reports to model the meetings 
they can be having with their team leaders and teams
	
Make expectations visual and don’t forget the top line: the vision of your orga­
nization. (See Chapter 12 for information about creating visuals.)
Encouraging employees’ accomplishments
Meeting expectations is a great accomplishment for every employee. Feeling 
in control is a great accomplishment for every employee’s brain. Leaders 
create opportunities for employees to make things happen and to make a dif­
ference in some of the following ways:
	
✓	Even if you think you can do a job better or faster, don’t. Delegate 
responsibility to your employees.
	
✓	Set the bar. Outline, define, draw, or tattoo the expectations and skills 
employees need to get the job done. Make them clear and specific, and 
be certain your employees can see how they contribute to the achieve­
ment of a goal.
	
✓	Help employees visualize success using emotion, fact, and symbols.
	
✓	Keep lines of communication open. Assure employees that they can ask 
any questions they may have along the way. Their input is important to 
you and to the success of the company. They may find a better way to 
reach your goals.

169
 Chapter 10: Enabling Your Current Employees to Excel
	
✓	Allow for differences in intelligences and learning style. You may be better 
at visualizing and expect others to be able to see your picture, but some 
may get messages or get things done by listening, talking, or acting. Getting 
to the same place through different channels is perfectly acceptable.
	
✓	Let employees know that you’re available to help them problem-solve. 
Show them that you are passionate about your company and want to 
help if they need it.
	
✓	Celebrate the small successes. Growth can be slow and sometimes a 
little painful. Be the head cheerleader.
	
✓	Celebrate when expectations are met. If you see room for more growth 
with just a little stretching, offer employees the opportunity to keep 
growing. Don’t diminish what has been accomplished, but show them 
that you always stretch yourself and that they may do so as well.
	
✓	Be prepared to make changes. Good employees sometimes find them­
selves in the wrong place. If you can, offer options whenever an assigned 
project isn’t working for a particular person. People don’t excel in every 
situation or in every environment. Give yourself and your employee a 
chance to grow under different conditions.
Retrain and retain or fire and rehire?
Good employees can become great employees. When your business grows, it 
also changes. Some changes require new skills, and so you add new employ­
ees, replace current employees, or retrain current employees. Which do you 
do? Rather than firing current employees and hiring others, you may be able 
to retrain some of your employees. Some may be resistant to change. But if 
they’re good employees and can see your vision, they may be more willing to 
be retrained.
Good reasons to retrain rather than rehire include the following:
	
✓	Hitting the ground running. Current employees know their way around 
the organization.
	
✓	Security for other employees. Rather than wondering who’s next on the 
chopping block, employees may trust the company to at least offer them 
a chance to retrain.
	
✓	Increasing productivity through self-confidence and motivation from 
learning new skills.
Although some leaders believe that change is too difficult for most employ­
ees, you can determine who is changeable. Those who are on board with 
your vision and see the big picture are doing their jobs with the goal of ben­
efiting the company or doing something for others. Those who may not get 
that don’t see beyond their jobs.

170
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
There is a story, or perhaps a legend, about the difference between doing a 
job and being part of a vision. In 1969, when the United States was about to 
send a man to the moon, NASA was crawling with reporters. One reporter 
approached a custodian who was sweeping the floors and asked, “What do 
you do?” The custodian stopped sweeping, leaned on his broom, and very 
seriously replied, “Why, I’m here to help put a man on the moon.”
Find the employees who see beyond their cubicle, their team, or their pro­
cedures. Meet with those who you believe want to be part of your vision and 
ask them what they do. If the answer is something like, “I am in charge of 
advertising,” he may not be the one to make changes with you. But if he says, 
“I’m helping this company sell more cars than any other company,” you’ve 
got a winner.

Chapter 11
Hiring the Best Brain for the Job
In This Chapter
▶	Choosing the brains that will work for you
▶	Ensuring that values and goals align
▶	Making effective hiring decisions
H
umans are a social species, and so every brain has two components: 
a personal brain and a social brain. When hiring the perfect brain for 
the job, you must check to see whether your candidate works exclusively 
from his personal identity or if at work he operates from his social identity. 
The personal brain involves itself entirely in what’s in it for the individual. 
Of course, no one takes a job without some personal benefit. But the social 
brain uses socialization for survival and for getting along with others for 
the betterment of the group. You want your employees to be thinking “we” 
instead of just “I.”
	
The best brain for the job may not be the “smartest” brain — the one with all 
of the appropriate degrees and the highest grades. This brain may have the 
highest IQ, but as I describe in Chapter 8, emotional and social intelligence 
lead to success in an organization.
This employee must be enthusiastic — as excited about your organization 
as you are. You also want him to share your company values and fall in step 
with the way you do things. That’s not to say you don’t want a brain that 
thinks outside the box, you just want that thinking to match your thinking 
and your goals for the organization. Finally, you want people with good com­
munication skills, whether they’re communicating with you, other employees, 
or your customers.
	
People don’t necessarily buy your product or your service. They buy you and 
the people who work for you; they buy the way you make them feel. Top sales­
men can’t sell only their product to their customers, they can sell almost any 
product to their customers. They know how to include others in their social 
identity.

172
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
What skills or talents does it take to create these strong relationships? This 
chapter helps you consider what characteristics you want in an employee. 
You get the opportunity to take a look at yourself as a leader, and you find 
out how to pick others who follow your lead and walk your walk.
Picking Brains: Approaches to Hiring
When you look for new employees, you pick brains, as in choosing the ones 
you want to hire, and you pick brains, as in checking those brains to deter­
mine whether they have what you need.
If you’re just starting up a business, you may be picking a lot of brains to ful­
fill the mission of your organization. If you have a small business, one wrong 
person can make a big difference in the group dynamics and productivity.
The upcoming sections introduce you to approaches for hiring employees, 
whatever your situation.
Look for those who love the work
Love sounds like a “soft” word to use in business, but love of work has the 
strength to make things happen. The more people love the work and the 
vision you create, the more likely they are to share that vision and make the 
entire company more productive.
How do you really know that the person you are considering for a job loves 
her job? Look for these indicators:
	
✓	Her job is also her hobby. For example, people who work in animal shel­
ters usually have animals at home that they love and care for.
	
✓	She has personal skills related to the position. Home improvement cen­
ters hire employees who are not only skilled at building, decorating, or 
fixing things around the house, they also want employees with the abil­
ity to teach others how to complete those tasks.
	
✓	She has done the kind of work you want previously.
Work that you love energizes you. During an interview, ask the candidate 
what he does after work. If he says, “I work so hard that I’m too tired to do 
anything,” either he is trying to impress you with his hard work or his work 
doesn’t energize him. I’d rather have an employee who went out running or 
worked in the garden than one who is totally exhausted at the end of the 

173
 Chapter 11: Hiring the Best Brain for the Job
day. Energy is particularly important if your organization works in teams. If 
employees are truly collaborating, the interaction motivates and energizes 
them. If your people are really dragging at the end of the day, the work they 
are doing may be too stressful.
Look for workers that you love 
A second approach to hiring is to choose people you would like to work 
with — even if this employee is not going to work directly with you. If you 
already like the people who work for you and you feel good about the 
person you’re interviewing, you can reasonably expect that they can all 
get along.
Finding employees with whom you’ll enjoy working relies upon your emo­
tional intelligence — that ability to listen to what your gut tells you. Being a 
good judge of character is a valuable leadership trait. You have to trust your­
self. But that doesn’t mean that you jump into hiring anyone who sits down 
at an interview and you happen to like. You need to give yourself time and 
several meetings to determine whether that instinct continues.
A tale of two pities
Ronnie gets up at 6:30 a.m. to get ready for 
work. He hits the snooze button at least four 
times because he really doesn’t want to get 
up. He hates his job, but he needs the money. 
While he’s at work, he rarely speaks to anyone, 
unless he’s complaining. What does he com­
plain about? Ronnie says he was meant for 
greater things. He doesn’t get paid enough, and 
his department supervisor is a horse’s rear end. 
Ronnie has his own pity party everyday. When 
he is asked why he feels that way, Ronnie just 
shrugs his shoulders and rolls his eyes.
Ronnie works with a team, but he doesn’t par­
ticipate at team meetings, no matter how hard 
his team leader tries. Ronnie spends a lot of 
time looking at the clock. By the end of the day 
when Ronnie turns in his work, he’s tired and 
can’t wait to get home, lie on the couch, and 
veg out.
Steven pities Ronnie. He just doesn’t get why 
anyone would work where he was so unhappy. 
Steven loves his job, and if Ronnie weren’t so 
negative and participated at meetings, Steven 
would like it even more. Steven knows Ronnie 
thinks he’s stuck at a dead-end job, but the 
truth is, there is room for advancement. Yes, 
Steven pities Ronnie, and he’s beginning to pity 
the whole department that Ronnie is in. Ronnie 
takes a lot of fun out of work when he’s around. 
Steven hopes the team leader will move Ronnie 
to another department.
Employees like Ronnie emphasize the impor­
tance of finding people who like their work and 
are energized by it.

174
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Whether you’re leading ten people or a thousand, you want them to wake 
up every morning looking forward to coming to work, and putting together a 
team of personalities that mesh goes a long way toward that goal. One suc­
cessful salesman for a wholesale clothing company told me, “I look forward 
to my work week because every day I get to have lunch with my friends. I get 
paid to hang out with great people. I’ve got the best job in the world.” There 
were months when this salesman made a lot in commissions, but even when 
times were bad, he wouldn’t leave his job because he would miss his friends!
	
Of course you want someone who can do the job. But given two candidates 
who can do the work, hire the one you like best. Some hiring managers even 
choose the lesser qualified person if they think she can fit in better with the 
team of workers. A quarterback whose arm isn’t as strong but who can unite 
the team is more valuable than one who doesn’t get team rapport and can 
throw a little farther.
	
Use the multiple intelligence assessment in Chapter 7 on all of your employees 
and then use it on your interviewees. See how they fit together. Your gut may 
be more important than any written assessment, but learning-style assess­
ments and Meyers Briggs Inventories often help predict how individuals will 
work together.
Looking for leaders
If you believe that every employee you have can’t be a star, you’re probably 
hiring the wrong people. Every single person in your employ should be a 
potential leader. As the leader, you already have followers, many with great 
leadership potential. Hiring someone who simply wants to follow the follow­
ers shortchanges you and your organization.
Seth Godin, author of Tribes, calls people who fight to keep everything status 
quo sheepwalkers. Sheepwalkers do what they’re told to do and nothing 
more. Do you want a bunch of sheepwalkers working for you? You want 
people who are thinkers and risk-takers, employees who shake things up a bit 
and make your business better.
Building a Brain Trust
In Chapter 9, I talk about the combination of your cognitive skills and your 
emotions to make good decisions. Hiring someone who is going to help you 
take your organization to the next level is one of the biggest decisions you 
will ever make. Can you trust your brain? And what about that instinct? 
Potential employees come to you with data, with personality, with a work 
ethic, and with values. You need to examine all of these factors to determine 
whether they are the right brains for the job.

175
 Chapter 11: Hiring the Best Brain for the Job
Valuing the values
When you hire people to become a part of your organization, you want to be 
sure that their values are your values. Make sure you are personally clear 
about those values and ask any possible employee what theirs are. You are 
after shared values, for if you share the same values, then this person should 
conduct herself in a similar manner to you and your other workers.
Your values determine the relationships you have. When you’re open about 
your personal and business values, your current and future employees 
admire your openness and honesty.
Waving the white flag
Dale Tate is a great guy. He’s one of those 
people that everyone likes. He values his family 
and his friends. When he thinks back to the 
interview he had with the president of the com­
pany he now works for, he realizes that the guy 
wasn’t walking his talk, but because of hard 
economic times, Dale had to take the job. Dale 
is a regional manager for an accessories firm 
that has kiosks in malls throughout the mid-
Atlantic states. Rent for kiosk space has gone 
up, and the president of the company has called 
a meeting of all the regional directors.
What Dale thought would be a motivational and 
informational meeting turned into a declaration 
of war. Threats were issued. (“If things don’t 
improve, there will be no more regional man­
agers.”) Cutthroat techniques were suggested. 
(“Do whatever it takes to get the business from 
the other mall stores.”) Statements that gnawed 
at Dale’s stomach were issued. (“In this busi­
ness, you have to work every single day. Watch 
those kiosk salespeople. They’ll steal from you. 
It’s kill or be killed in today’s economy.”)
Dale’s stomach churned during that meeting. 
When he was sent off to complete the new mis­
sion, “Kill the competition,” Dale could barely 
stand to get up in the mornings to go to work.
At the next month’s meeting, the president 
spoke again. This time he humiliated a few of 
the other regional directors because their sales 
were so bad. Dale sat frozen in his chair as he 
waited to be belittled by the president. When it 
didn’t happen, Dale was relieved. But later as 
he thought about it, he realized that he shouldn’t 
have to live this way. He felt like a zebra waking 
each morning in the Serengeti hoping that there 
would be no lions around.
When he could take it no longer, Dale quit. He 
had actually been doing the best job of all of the 
regional managers. The president had just given 
Dale a raise. But all of the tension and negativ­
ity were still there. Dale found something for 
a lower salary, but he worked for a company 
that values the contribution of others. Dale felt 
like he had given up and that just wasn’t like 
him, but he was much happier after he left that 
company.
If Dale had been clearly told what the values 
of the company were, he probably would not 
have accepted the job in the first place. You 
don’t want to spend precious dollars training 
people who really don’t feel comfortable with 
your values and therefore may leave.

176
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Your values statements describe how you treat other people in your organiza­
tion, how you treat your customers, and how you treat any other stakeholders 
involved in business with you. By sharing your values statements with your 
interviewees, you are telling them “the way things are done around here”: 
	
✓	How you expect them to behave
	
✓	What they are allowed to do
	
✓	What behaviors are inappropriate when dealing with others
Perhaps before you spill the beans about your values, you may want to ask a 
few questions about their values. You might begin with some questions like 
these:
	
✓	If you could work for any leader in the world, alive or dead, who would 
you pick?
	
✓	What about that particular leader that led you to choose him?
	
✓	What guiding principles did this leader follow?
	
✓	In what way are those guiding principles the same principles that you 
value?
	
✓	In what type of culture or environment do you like to work?
The more personal clarity you get from job candidates, the more they may be 
worth considering. The brain that knows itself and is committed to its own 
values is much more valuable than a brain that doesn’t know what its guid­
ing principles are. Truly knowing yourself and what you value requires good 
communication between the executive areas of the brain and the emotional 
areas. Without knowledge of her own values, even someone who can recite 
your values statements to the letter may have little dedication to your values.
Scanning brains
As you look at the files or portfolios of each candidate, you may become 
overwhelmed. Resumes can be wonderful tools, and they can be misleading.
Interviews give you further insight, but one just isn’t enough. What do you do 
to separate the best from the rest? Try these steps:
	
1.	Search the Internet.
	
	 Yes, search the Web for all of your candidates, using a search engine 
like Google or Bing. Check out Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn, and any 
other social or business networking site. You may be surprised by 
what you find. 

177
 Chapter 11: Hiring the Best Brain for the Job
	
	 One large corporation brought in a CEO based on her resume, which 
listed some pretty impressive accomplishments. All of the accomplish­
ments checked out. 
	
	 An extensive Internet search would have revealed newspaper articles 
that would have dissuaded them from offering her a contract. (She had 
pulled the wool over the eyes of several top companies. After these 
former organizations had hired her, she refused to work on community 
relations and had a closed-door policy.) Less than two years after hiring 
her, the board couldn’t wait to get rid of her; members discovered that 
they weren’t the first company to be taken in. Deficit spending and poor 
community communication hurt the company badly. They ended up 
buying out the last year of her contract.
	
2.	Look closely at candidates’ credentials.
	
	A potential hire’s educational background may look terribly impressive 
on paper, but is it the real deal? People lie. Others tweak the truth. Just 
changing a few words can make someone look fabulous on paper.
	
	Confirm any candidate’s educational background. If you have been given 
false information, scratch that candidate off the list.
	
3.	Confirm the applicant’s work experience.
	
	Even recent graduates have previous employers from college jobs, 
internships, or fellowships. Although most employers no longer provide 
much information for legal reasons, at least make sure the candidate 
did work where they say they did. If your instinct tells you something 
doesn’t sound quite right, scratch a candidate or at least put her in the 
“hold” stack until you’ve checked out everyone else.
	
4.	Ask around.
	
	Find out whether your business contacts have heard of or even inter­
viewed the candidates you’re interested in. Ask around about the com­
panies your candidates use to work for. You may find some valuable 
information. 
	
	For instance, a chain of upscale hair salons in Chicago was looking for a 
manager for one of their suburban shops. A woman from Indiana applied 
for the position and listed on her resume four years’ experience with a 
large salon in South Bend. A member of the senior team in Chicago rec­
ognized the name of the salon because her sister lived in South Bend. 
Upon checking up on the South Bend business, they discovered that it 
had let several stylists go in the wake of embezzlement. No further infor­
mation was available, but nevertheless, the Chicago firm took a pass on 
hiring the woman.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Going deeper in a second interview
You’re down to the short list. It’s time for the second interview and some 
tough tests for the several candidates you’re considering. Sometimes a cor­
poration creates a situation to see how the candidate does in as natural a 
situation as possible to check on stress levels and responses.
For instance, a corporation of nursing homes wants to hire some employees 
for a new location. They need registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, 
certified nurse’s assistants, a social worker, a manager, a dietician, an activi­
ties director, and a receptionist — just for starters.
Keep an eye out for red flags
Jim hired Jana because she came highly rec­
ommended by the owner of a business that 
had to downsize. Jim needed a new director 
of sales and was told that Jana Schmidt was 
the best. Her resume was very impressive. She 
graduated from a prestigious university and had 
worked for companies larger than Jim’s. She 
was available not only because of the downsiz­
ing, but because she had moved to this small 
southeastern city because her husband was 
transferred.
Jim didn’t take much time with the interview; he 
needed someone now, and on paper Jana was 
perfect. But that was the only place she was 
perfect. After he hired her, Jim soon found out 
that Jana’s values didn’t match up with his or 
his company’s values. Jana valued herself. She 
wanted a title, power, and a good income. (Jim 
paid her more than he had thought he could 
afford but imagined she would be worth it if she 
did the job.)
Jana treated no one with respect. She was 
snooty because of her educational background 
and the fact that her parents had money. The 
sales department suffered terribly under this 
change in the culture. Jim began receiving 
complaints and decided not to say anything to 
Jana. After all, she had just begun the job. She 
was probably a bit nervous. Actually, Jim was 
nervous about the situation; hiring a new sales 
director was one of his last-ditch efforts to get 
the company headed in the right direction. He 
told the sales people to be patient.
As Jana ranted about low sales, motivation 
went down. She started threatening her sales 
force, and one of the best sales people found a 
job with another company. Jim tried talking to 
Jana. She was as sweet as could be whenever 
they conversed. She told him she didn’t under­
stand what the problem was. She said these 
people just didn’t have proper motivation and 
her style was simply to raise expectations. The 
problem was she offered no help to her team. 
She told them what to do but not how to do it.
When Jim explained how the company was 
run, that they were all in this together like one 
big happy family, Jana just shook her head. 
Her values were so mismatched with the com­
pany’s that she would never fit in. After several 
months, Jim let Jana go.
Jim’s hastiness in hiring someone who looked 
good on paper led to problems that he would 
not have had to deal with if he had taken more 
time to get to know his seemingly golden 
candidate.

179
 Chapter 11: Hiring the Best Brain for the Job
Dealing with the geriatric set is different from dealing with other age groups, 
and so this corporation sets up second interviews and has candidates wait 
in the reception area for at least 30 minutes. During that time, older people 
enter the room and require some help. One may be confused about where 
she is, for example. Another may knock something over. A keen eye watches 
to see what candidates do in each situation. Who jumps up to open the door 
for the elderly? Who gives up his seat when the waiting area is full? Those 
who are kind and caring, do not show any irritation, and go out of their way 
to help are more seriously considered for the job.
Second interviews outside the office in a more casual setting often offer good 
information about how candidates might handle themselves with customers. 
You can learn a lot over a casual meal. The ways that candidates treat the 
wait staff, taxi drivers, and people on the street can be revealing.
Honest, purposeful questions reveal a lot about the candidate. For example
	
✓	If you become part of this company and work with us toward our goals, 
how would you like to be remembered? 
	
✓	How are you going to approach the work you do here to make that happen?
	
✓	How do you think our company can make a difference? And how can you 
help?
Bringing employees into the mix
After candidates make it through the resume search, the networking search, 
the Internet search, and the first and second interviews with you, you’re 
ready to bring in the big brains. Rather than relying exclusively on yourself 
to choose your employees, let those who will work with the new hire conduct 
an interview. Try the following:
	
✓	Pick out two of the employees in the department for which you are 
hiring — two who truly display the “we” attitude.
	
	Be sure they get along well with you and with others on their team.
	
✓	Let them get to know the candidate first in a formal meeting and later in 
a more social situation, like lunch.
	
✓	Find out whether they were able to build rapport and find common 
values. Compare your experience with theirs.
	
✓	If a candidate passes the first interview with his potential co-workers, let 
the interviewers take the candidate to their department and get to know 
the others who they may be working with.
If the entire team wants this candidate and you like this person as well, you 
have your new employee.

180
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Mirroring the behaviors you want
Nothing works better than modeling the behavior you want to see. Abraham 
Lincoln and Martin Luther King were respected and followed because they 
believed in what they lived and they shared what they believed. Whether you 
are interviewing, showing others around your business or interacting with 
your employees, what you do is what you get. Some of this stems from the fact 
that your shared values inspire your employees or employee candidates, and 
some comes from the action of mirror neurons, which are linked particularly to 
empathy and inspire mimicry. Chapter 8 tells you more about mirror neurons.
Providing some interaction between you and your candidates in the work set­
ting gives them a better feel for how you live your values. Let them see how 
you treat others, talk to customers, and consider everyone’s feelings. Doing 
so also gives you the opportunity to see how well the candidate follows your 
lead. Can she mimic your welcoming smile, your sincere handshake, and your 
desire to please the customer?
The sales manager at an upscale dress shop always takes her job applicants 
out on the floor to meet customers. This shop thrives on regular clients and 
the place is busy all of the time. Introductions are made and after the man­
ager chats with the customer, he leaves an opening for the candidate to jump 
into the conversation. If the candidate fails to engage the customer, he falls 
out of consideration for the position.
Ready, Aim, Hire!
Slow down. You wouldn’t get married after just one date. But if you have had at 
least two interviews, researched the candidate, and watched him interact with 
the other members of the team or with good customers, you may be ready.
You don’t usually buy a new car without taking at least one test drive. Give 
the employee a trial period if you can. A new employee is similar to a student 
on the first few days of school, she’s on good behavior. When the honeymoon 
period is over, the true behavior comes out. Let the candidate now spend 
some real time on the job working with his possible team members. Doing 
so benefits both of you. If he hates the work after the trial, off he goes. If he 
doesn’t fit in with others, you have the option of saying goodbye or trying 
him out in another capacity.
	
If you haven’t found the perfect brain for the job, don’t hire because you’re 
desperate or frustrated. Keep looking and you can find the right person. 
You’re better off taking your time to find that person who loves your work, 
loves your workers, and shares your values.

Chapter 12
Optimizing Working Conditions
In This Chapter
▶	Engaging the brain’s visual system
▶	Maintaining basic physical comfort
▶	Using music to energize and motivate
▶	Addressing the (sometimes desperate) need for sleep
▶	Making the most of any workspace
▶	Laughing all the way to the bank
P
roductivity flourishes under the right conditions. If you want a success­
ful business, make your employees happy. If you want a successful and 
profitable business, make their brains happy. Chemicals in the brain create 
pleasure, motivation, kinship, and inspiration when working conditions are 
optimal.
Think about the places you have worked. Pick out the one in which you were 
the happiest, the most secure, and the most productive. Under what condi­
tions were you working? Unless you love being alone, I doubt that you chose 
the cubby hole that separated you from other employees. And unless your 
job found you playing in a band, I would be surprised if you were happiest 
amongst loud music and a bit of chaos.
In this chapter you find out how to create an environment in which the brain 
thrives. Using visuals, providing music to help stimulate the mind and the 
body, creating the right temperature for thinking and making connections, 
and providing time for an occasional nap may be just what your employees 
are looking for.

182
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Stimulating the Brain’s Visual System
You actually do get the picture more than you “get” words. Most studies 
show that adding a visual to information increases retention from a mere 10 
percent to 65 percent. The brain is set up for visual representations, and the 
eyes can be trained to see what is important.
If you put your hand on the back of your head, you’re touching the part of 
the skull that protects your occipital lobe — the area that processes vision. 
Columns of neurons cover the outer layer of the occipital lobe; each column 
is responsible for a different aspect of what you see. One column may see 
only 45-degree angles or the color blue. Your visual experience relies on 
these columns coming together and forming a complete picture.
But that picture is not completely reliable. What you see is biased by what 
you know. For one thing, you have blind spots — areas in your vision that 
don’t hold visual information. Nonetheless, you never see a dark spot. Your 
brain calculates what should be in those spots and fills in the blanks.
Your employees take in the visual information that surrounds them. I was 
doing some trainings for a chain of hardware stores several years ago. At one 
of the locations, I walked into the office to wait for the manager. I sat down in 
a not very comfortable chair and found myself directly across from a calen­
dar displaying June 1972 (It was 1995.) and a young, scantily clad girl bending 
over to pick a tool out of her toolbox. The remainder of the walls were bare. 
I was surprised and a bit disappointed that the manager I was working with 
thought this image was appropriate; the calendar made me uncomfortable as 
I carried on a conversation with him.
What you place on walls might be a personal choice, but my question would 
be, “What do you want your employees thinking about?” I think most leaders 
want their employees thinking about work. Whatever is on display at work 
affects all those who see it.
	
You can keep employees’ eyes on the prize, so to speak, by placing their goals 
within visual range in offices, workrooms, meeting rooms, and labs.
Help them get the picture by giving them the picture! Your targets are 
words. The brain remembers pictures more. Create a poster or sign with 
the target or goal and add something visual to it. For instance, “We’ll Nail 
Your Problems at Stein Hardware!” Pictures of employees helping customers 
in different departments of the store appeared with the slogan on posters. 
Nails held the posters to walls throughout the store. Employees had a visual 
reminder of the bottom line — helping the customer.

183
 Chapter 12: Optimizing Working Conditions
Think of your workplace as an opportunity to sell your employees on working 
for you. Where you place visuals makes a difference in what people see, how 
they perceive it, and what they feel about the visual. Table 12-1 gives you sug­
gestions for hanging visuals effectively.
Table 12-1	
Placing Visuals for Optimum Impact
Location
Reason
Place material you want employees to talk about 
at eye level. You company’s current goal is one 
example. Others would be reminders, messages, 
and so on.
Eye-level visuals are easy to 
see and so catch employees’ 
eyes often.
Place information you want employees to 
remember higher than eye level. “How to” 
instructions are one example.
Employees tend to look up 
when they’re relaxing and 
taking a break. 
Put feel-good information, like charts that show 
growth and improvement, below eye level.
You look down when you 
access your feelings.
	
Posters can be fun and inspiring, or they can provide messages that you might 
not want to have around the office. For example, “Hang in there till Friday!” 
doesn’t send the message that work is a good place to be. Choose your mes­
sages carefully.
Utilizing color
Many studies suggest that color affects the brain and behavior. Color affects 
mood and emotions. It makes you wonder if UPS, United Parcel Service, has 
brown uniforms to show less dirt or to instill confidence.
Understand how color works before you determine the colors of your visuals, 
the color of your walls and carpet, and even the colors your employees wear. 
The following are some common effects that various colors produce:
	
✓	Black represents strength, power, and luxury.
	
✓	Blue creates a feeling of reliability and trust; blue also increases 
creativity.
	
✓	Brown denotes confidence and security.
	
✓	Burgundy represents warmth, strength, and status.
	
✓	Green brings to mind prosperity and success.

184
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
	
✓	Red is associated with alertness and helps you focus.
	
✓	Yellow energizes.
Studies show how color affects emotional states. Painting a locker room 
bubble-gum pink actually calmed football players down — calmed them too 
much for the coach’s taste. (The color also is used in jail holding cells to 
create more passive prisoners.)
What color is your conference room, waiting room, or sales room? Some sug­
gest that painting these rooms blue to provide the feeling of reliability is a 
great idea. And some businesses are carefully choosing uniforms according 
to what customers might perceive from colors.
Shedding some bright light on the subject
If you want to avoid accidents, eyestrain, and stress in your workplace, check 
out the lighting. Work productivity increases with appropriate lighting.
Many businesses use fluorescent lighting because it’s cheaper. But fluores­
cents increase stress hormone levels like cortisol. These lights flicker and 
hum and can negatively affect the nervous system, causing symptoms like 
attention problems. Even though many employees stop noticing the flickering 
and hum, a few hours into the workday they find themselves deeply fatigued.
Natural sunlight is best for mood, energy, and generally feeling good. Lack 
of sunlight may prevent the brain from producing serotonin, which affects 
moods in a positive way. You know how everyone wants an office with a 
window? The view may be great, and the sunlight not only provides Vitamin 
D but helps the brain release those feel-good chemicals.
	
Full-spectrum bulbs mimic sunlight. If you have offices without windows, the 
full-spectrum lighting may be even more important. Make sure workers in 
these windowless environments get frequent breaks that take them to rooms 
with windows. Sunlight provides vitamin D, increases the release of serotonin, 
and decreases depression.
Getting Comfortable on the Job
Your brain is always tracking your environment: what it looks like, how it 
makes you feel, and how your senses are affected by it. Taking care of the 
physical environment for your employees and making them comfortable 
shows them that you care about their needs. Comfort leads to better perfor­
mance and more productivity.

185
 Chapter 12: Optimizing Working Conditions
If the chair fits . . .
Sit up straight and you pay better attention. That’s what all my teachers told 
me. But some people work better slouching, standing, or lying on the ground. 
Meeting the needs of your employees means making them feel comfortable in 
their environment. Making them comfortable means happier, more produc­
tive workers.
Back pain can lead to absenteeism, physical and emotional stress, lower 
cognition, and less efficiency. A good chair can go a long way to preventing 
the pain that causes the trouble, making employees feel better in general and 
even encouraging healthy brain activity. An ergonomically designed chair 
includes a footrest, armrests, and support for the small of the back.
Successful seating takes some consideration so that you can address the dif­
ferent body types in your workplace. Give special concern for the seating of 
those who spend most of their days in a chair. Try the following suggestions:
	
✓	Take into consideration the size of the work space.
	
✓	Chairs should support the worker in a comfortable position.
	
✓	Height should be adjustable.
	
✓	Provide good lumbar support to encourage good posture.
	
✓	Padded seats promote circulation.
When you’re hot, you’re hot, and when 
you’re not, you’re probably cold
Climate control. Two of my favorite words. Many heated conversations 
have gone on in organizations about who should control the thermostat. 
Temperature is a somewhat personal choice, but studies show that there are 
optimal temperatures for the brain.
Some people have a different body thermostat than most — for those few I 
suggest fans and sweaters! When temperatures rise, the brain tends not to 
work as well. Comprehension tends to become a problem when the tempera­
ture rises above 74° Fahrenheit. Computation can become a problem when 
the room warms up to 77° Fahrenheit. Some studies show that accidents 
increase and productivity decreases when the heat goes up. A too-cold envi­
ronment decreases productivity, as well. As one administrative assistant 
said, “I don’t type well with gloves on!”

186
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
You need to provide a comfortable and healthy indoor environment for your­
self and your employees. Bringing in outdoor air dilutes building contami­
nants and replenishes oxygen. You have probably attended or presented in 
an enclosed room and felt sleepy or witnessed others becoming sleepy. The 
low level of oxygen in the room may be the culprit. (Or it could be boring 
slides or speakers!)
Ultraviolet lights installed in the duct system or air purifiers (which take the 
place of the furnace filter) in the heating and cooling system help stop the 
spread of colds and viruses. These options also make those who suffer from 
asthma or allergies more comfortable. These products can be added to any 
forced-air system by a heating and cooling contractor.
Humidity is an interesting factor in climate control. People can be comfort­
able at 80 degrees if the humidity is only 20 percent or at 75 degrees with 55 
percent humidity. Air conditioning normally dehumidifies in the summer, 
but during the cold winter months you must humidify to keep employees 
comfortable at 68 degrees. Heating and cooling contractors have a variety of 
products, from a steam system to evaporator pads, that enable you to add 
humidity.
Putting a Song in Their Hearts — 
Or At Least in Their Cubes
Auditory stimuli bombard the brain every second. Buildings have all types of 
acoustic problems that can be stressful, distracting, and even provoke anger. 
Addressing all of the problems may be difficult, but covering them with some 
brain-stimulating or relaxing music is a relatively simple task.
Choosing music: If it ain’t baroque, fix it
The brain responds well to music. Dr. Georgi Lozanov, a Bulgarian psychia­
trist and professor of education, was the first scientist to systematically 
research the factors involved in rapid learning. His major premise was that 
learning is a natural, joyful process. He found that music synchronized 
breathing, heart rate, and brain waves to relax the body and mind. Relaxed 
alertness is a very receptive state for learning. The types of music that pro­
duced this effect were classical and baroque.

187
 Chapter 12: Optimizing Working Conditions
Chapter 2 explains that brain cells communicate through chemical and elec­
trical activity in the brain. The electrical activity is measured in terms of 
waves, which cycle at different rates per second. Table 12-2 shows you the 
four levels of brain activity.
Table 12-2	
States of the Brain

Alpha

You spend most of your waking time in the rapid Beta state, which enables 
you to do all the things that your busy schedule requires. However, Beta 
waves do not provide an opportunity for creativity and deep thought; Alpha 
or Theta states do. Specific kinds of music help relax your body, slow down 
your breathing rate, lower your heart rate, and offer the opportunity for cre­
ativity and learning:
	
✓	Much Baroque music, which was composed between 1600 to 1750 has 
40 to 60 beats per minute, making it ideal for relaxation.
	
✓	Classical music was composed between 1750 and 1820 and is more ener­
getic and forceful than baroque music. Classical is excellent for team­
work and problem-solving. It usually contains 60 to 80 beats per minute.
	
✓	Romantic music was written between 1820 and 1900. It is very energetic 
with a lot of variations. Because it has more than 80 beats per minute, 
romantic music is perfect for working toward deadlines.
	
Music tends to stimulate both the left and right sides of the brain. The left and 
right hemispheres have different functions and, although you use both sides 
when you listen to music, each hemisphere responds to it differently. The left 
hemisphere is involved with analyzing the music, while the right appreciates 
the sounds. Studies also suggest that when music stimulates the right side of 
the brain, it eliminates day dreaming and aids concentration.
Music also helps you remember information, in large part because it affects 
your emotions. The same part of the brain controls emotions and long-term 
memory. Attach music to learning, and you add an emotional element that 
stimulates retention.

188
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Music also appears to stimulate the release of serotonin and dopamine. 
These same chemicals are released when you eat chocolate, have orgasms, 
and partake in other personal pleasures. Most people admit that music does 
make them feel good.
Music in the workplace can change employees’ emotional states. Calming 
music may lower stress. Music can also get people moving faster. A faster 
beat when teams are working together may help them get the job done faster.
Examine the following positive effects of music to decide whether it should 
be part of your working environment. Music can
	
✓	Increase focus and creativity
	
✓	Calm and lower stress
	
✓	Energize
	
✓	Increase concentration
	
✓	Make people happy
	
✓	Cover distracting noises
	
✓	Stimulate conversation
	
✓	Pump up celebrations
	
✓	Signal meeting times, closing times, and break times
Some of your employees may have negative anchors to certain music; they 
associate certain songs or tunes to specific, unpleasant times in their lives. 
Mozart doesn’t make you smarter
In 1991, Alfred A. Tomatis described “the 
Mozart effect” in his book, Pourquoi Mozart? 
Tomatis asserted that listening to Mozart 
healed and developed the brain. Research con­
ducted by Gordon Shaw and Frances Rauscher 
at the University of California, Irvine, in 1993 
suggested that listening to Mozart “primes” the 
neuronal connections that are used for abstract 
reasoning. The subjects of the study listened 
to ten minutes of Mozart’s Sonata for Two 
Pianos in D before taking a test. Another group 
listened to minimalist music by Phillip Glass, 
and the control group didn’t listen to music at 
all. Those listening to Mozart did better on the 
test than the other two groups, but the replica­
tion of this study was unsuccessful for the most 
part. The media loved this research, and head­
line after headline proclaimed “Mozart Makes 
You Smarter.” Books were also written on the 
topic and many Mozart CDs were sold. You can 
increase your brain power, sure, but listening to 
Mozart is not going to do it.

189
 Chapter 12: Optimizing Working Conditions
These pieces of music may elicit a mental state that you do not want and that 
is not conducive to working. You can’t avoid this pitfall entirely, however, 
you can minimize it by using lesser known classics.
Setting the tone with music
The office manager for a physicians’ office tells a very interesting story about 
music. Music played for patients who were on hold because one of the physi­
cians had read that callers stay on the line longer when compared to those 
listening to nothing at all. The phone was set up to have callers listen to a 
radio station. The office manager knew little about radio stations and asked 
her son which station to put on. He chose one of his favorite stations.
The wife of a recent open-heart-surgery patient called because she was con­
cerned about her husband’s breathing. Put on hold without time to explain 
her call, she immediately began listening to hard rock music, which she 
found unsettling and which stressed her further. By the time the receptionist 
came back on the line, the woman was hysterical. Her own heart rate and res­
piration had increased from listening to the fast-paced selection.
Table 12-3 offers suggestions for matching music to departments and situa­
tions. I based these suggestions on work done by Eric Jensen (Music with the 
Brain in Mind), Jeff Green (The Green Book of Music), and Steve Halpern who 
has researched healing music. Steve’s Web site is www.innerpeacemusic.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
The Rest of the Story: Naps
Most people do not get the sleep they need at night. And even if they do, 
16-hour days require some rest periods. Providing a nap time for your work­
ers may sound silly, but it could be very beneficial to you.
Sometime in the late afternoon, usually around the three o’clock mark, every­
one hits a wall for a short period of time. Suddenly, the computer screen 
looks fuzzy, you can’t focus on your paperwork, or running that machine 
takes more effort than it did just minutes earlier.
The black hole hits us all. Maybe you’ve noticed employees nodding off 
in afternoon meetings. Those heavy eyelids aren’t a pretty sight, and they 
certainly don’t enhance productivity. Maybe you get angry when you see 
employees drowsing as you speak; maybe you wonder whether you’re a boring 
person. You might be, but even if you’re the world’s most engaging speaker, 
the black hole wins in the mid-afternoon — hands down and heads down.
Some large organizations incorporate a nap time into their day. In other 
countries taking a siesta is expected. NASA conducted a study with airline 
pilots and found that a 26-minute nap boosted performance by 33 percent. 
Research shows that nappers outperform non-nappers. Sixty to ninety min­
utes’ sleep gives brains a chance to dump some of the information that accu­
mulated throughout the day. The nappers scored as though they had slept 
six hours.
Many employees nap during their lunch hours by catching a few winks in 
their cars. You might take a survey and see whether your employees are 
already napping or feel they need a nap during the day. Happy brains work 
better, and rested brains are more likely to be happy. 
Some corporations, such as Ben and Jerry’s Homemade Ice Cream, have 
created nap rooms for their employees to use when they get tired. Because 
sleep needs vary, offering the opportunity for a short nap makes more sense 
than setting up schedules. Comfortable chairs and soft music may be helpful 
for some employees.
Working Well, Even in Cubby Holes
When evidence became available that the brain can produce new neurons, 
researchers examined rats in labs for neuron production and found none. 
Perhaps the brain couldn’t create new cells, after all.

191
 Chapter 12: Optimizing Working Conditions
Later research showed that in order to grow new neurons — the brain cells 
that learn and connect — brains need an enriched environment, one that 
is social and meets the needs I describe in Chapter 3. Research conducted 
in the 1960s by such famous neuroscientists as Dr. Marian Diamond and 
Dr. William Greenough compared rats kept in normal psychology rat labs 
which encompassed a life in a small cage with two fellow rats to rats placed 
in a large cage with plenty of things to do and play and a host of other rats 
to interact with. Theories about enriched environments were born. (And so 
were many rats!) The rats in the normal lab environment had few connecting 
fibers on their brain cells. Those in the enriched environment, however, had 
cells with a lot of fibers. The interaction with rat friends and rat toys caused 
new growth in the brain.
	
To save viable brain cells and encourage the growth of new cells, I suggest the 
following:
	
✓	Encourage workers to decorate their cubicles or offices. A personalized 
space is more fun to be in.
	
✓	Provide visual goals for them to display. Being separated from others 
may make keeping eyes on the prize more difficult. Make goals visible.
	
✓	Use productive color combinations in those cubicles. Energize them 
with yellow, help them focus with red.
	
✓	Provide music for motivation. Background sounds help most people feel 
less alone and less stressed.
	
✓	Provide bright lighting and appropriate lighting for close work. Dim 
lighting increases the production of melatonin, the chemical that makes 
you sleepy.
	
✓	Encourage employees to take frequent breaks, to leave the cubby and 
see daylight and fellow workers. These social and movement breaks 
give the brain a rest; seeing others reminds workers that they aren’t in 
this alone.
	
✓	Offer time and opportunity for play, exercise, and interaction. Movement 
and interaction release chemicals that help with focus, concentration, 
and feeling bonded with others.
	
✓	Give employees work to do in small groups, so they’re not isolated 
most of the day. Isolation can lead to depression. Groups provide con­
versation, interaction, and an opportunity to ask questions and solve 
problems.

Putting Humor to Work
You have good reason to get serious about humor in the workplace. Research 
on humor suggests that laughter 
	
✓	Increases productivity
	
✓	Burns calories 
	
✓	Lowers blood pressure
	
✓	Strengthens your immune system
	
✓	Bolsters coping mechanisms
	
✓	Enhances memory
	
✓	Increases alertness by adding oxygen to your blood
	
✓	Energizes
	
✓	Increases bonding and communication
People who are happy at work keep their jobs longer. Try mixing business 
with pleasure:
	
✓	Use humor to get employees to attend meetings: begin with a funny 
story or joke.
	
✓	Give an award to the employee who makes people laugh the most each 
week.
	
✓	Create a laughter bulletin board that employees can contribute to with 
cartoons, jokes, and so on.
	
✓	Send a joke of the day through e-mail or your intranet.
	
✓	Set a humorous tone. Encourage banter among your employees. You 
must begin. Try making fun of yourself or situations that you find your­
self in.
	
✓	Funny posters placed strategically can add laughter and humor.
	
✓	Look for humor at work. Some work situations (but not people) are 
funny, but your employees won’t laugh about them unless you or their 
team leader does.
	
Humor is not always a funny thing. Make sure that everyone knows there are 
rules for using humor. Jokes that poke fun are not allowed. Sarcasm is not 
good humor. Anything that you must follow up with “I was just kidding,” is 
not good humor.

Y
ou may have heard the outdated notion that women are right-brained 
(meaning creative, intuitive, freer with feelings) and men are left-
brained (analytical, detail oriented, less emotional). Fortunately, that insult­
ing idea went out with shoulder pads back in the ’80s. What stuck, though, is 
that men and women do indeed have different brains, and researchers have 
backed up that idea in studies that examine brains with high-tech imaging 
devices.
The ways that men’s and women’s brains are different shows up in pretty 
much everything humans do, and the workplace is no exception. This chap­
ter examines the characteristics of male and female brains, giving you knowl­
edge that can affect how well you understand yourself and your leadership 
style. You can use the information you find here to become a better supervi­
sor, manager, and negotiator as you develop a deeper understanding of the 
people with whom you’re working.
Ultimately, your organization benefits by becoming a gender-intelligent orga­
nization — a balanced workforce that utilizes the skills and talents of each 
gender to reach goals and create a workplace that retains the best workers, 
trains the best leaders, and has the best woman or man for each job.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Biology Basics: Size Doesn’t Matter, 
but a Lot of Other Stuff Does
The male brain is larger than the female brain. Both weigh in at about 
three pounds, but the male brain is about 11 percent heavier. Decades ago, 
researchers assumed that a larger brain meant higher intelligence, but intel­
ligence tests found that males and females are equally intelligent. So, in this 
case, size doesn’t matter.
	
Testosterone most likely is responsible for the larger size of the male brain. 
Men have a lot more of this hormone than women do.
Size might not matter, but in the sections that follow, you see that the physi­
cal development of male and female brains can affect the workplace and your 
ability to manage and lead.
Why gray matter matters
The male brain has six and a half times more gray matter than the female 
brain. As I discuss in Chapter 2, gray matter refers to the brain cell bodies 
that process information. The female brain has approximately ten times more 
white matter. The white matter transfers information to different processing 
centers throughout the brain. The fact of the matter is that both males and 
females have the same cognitive abilities, yet they utilize different pathways 
in their brains.
The prevalence of white and gray matter affects how people work together 
and alone. Take a look at the difference in these two ways of working:
	
✓	White-matter approach: The female brain uses all that white matter 
to integrate information from many areas, which adds to her language 
abilities (something I talk more about in the upcoming section, “Hearing, 
Listening, and Talking: Communication Differences”) and encourages her 
to utilize relationships to reach her goals. The white-matter approach 
goes beyond local processing, connecting to some of the brain’s geog­
raphy where male brains rarely tread: emotional areas, speech centers, 
and memory centers on both sides of the brain. In the workplace, the 
female brain is processing the work, the people, and the context sur­
rounding the objective. 
	
✓	Gray-matter approach: The male brain tends to process locally — 
within all that gray matter — which assists in accomplishing singular 
tasks and keeping focused on a given target. The gray matter approach 
is to get the job done; relationships are secondary. The male brain pro­
cesses the objective and finds the most direct path to that objective.

195
 Chapter 13: Understanding Male and Female Brains at Work
A mixed gender team often works well together. Leslie is a very successful 
car dealer. Paul is one of her biggest assets. Paul sells cars, too, but together 
the Leslie and Paul team sell lots of cars. Leslie uses the white matter 
approach; she integrates information from her emotional areas in her brain 
along with her uncanny ability to speak to people from different walks of life 
on a level that gets instant rapport. Leslie has honed her empathy skills and 
knows just what to say. Paul closes the sale. His gray matter approach allows 
him to specialize in the financial end of making deals. He uses local brain 
areas and creates financial deals that meet the budgets of the people buying 
cars. Customers feel that they have been taken care of and are confident they 
are getting a great deal.
	
Both the white and gray matter approaches to accomplishing tasks and 
achieving objectives can work equally well, but in a gender-intelligent organi­
zation, balancing these two approaches offers leadership the opportunity to 
see the big picture and be sure that nothing is missed.
Considering emotional differences
From birth, males notice things while females notice people. The larger right 
hemisphere in males may be the reason for this phenomenon. The right 
hemisphere houses several areas that focus on spatial ability. This creates 
men who are skillful at spatial reasoning, manipulation of objects, and gross 
motor skills.
Because males notice things rather than people, they have difficulty becom­
ing aware of and responding to signs of emotion. In a study at Stanford 
University, males and females were placed in scanners and shown emotional 
scenes. In the female brain, nine different areas showed activity, while in the 
male brains only two were active.
The multitasking female brain
You’ve probably heard the pervasive notion that 
women are better able than men to do several 
things at once. Although current research sug­
gests that multitasking is a myth — the brain is 
incapable of attending to more than one thing 
at a time — there may be two reasons for the 
multitasking assumption for women. 
One is the ability of the female brain’s white matter 
allowing it to collect and distribute information 
easily. Secondly, access to each hemisphere 
is accelerated by the size of the corpus cal­
losum, a bridge of fibers connecting the two 
hemispheres. Many studies suggest this that 
the female corpus callosum is larger than the 
male’s, and it certainly appears to account for 
the multiple brain areas used by the female in 
various endeavors.

196
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
The emotional structure in the brain, the amygdala, is always filtering infor­
mation for emotional content. The amygdala is larger in the male brain, but 
rather than making the male more sensitive to his own and other’s feelings, it 
seems to affect aggression. If a stressful situation arises, the amygdala alerts 
the hypothalamus, the structure in charge of internal responses, to get ready 
for the fight or flight response. Males are more likely to run or to defend 
themselves in a threatening situation. 
Males have emotions, but they are just not always great at sharing those 
emotions or recognizing emotions in others. In an analysis of hundreds of 
studies where men and women were shown pictures of people expressing 
various emotions, women outperformed the men 80 percent of the time.
Not being able to recognize emotions makes it difficult to share emotions, use 
them in conversation, or make decisions. Some males are at a disadvantage 
in this area. Men’s brains work very hard at reading emotion, but they some­
times use more primitive brain areas that lead them to reflexive behaviors 
rather than reflective ones.
Females tend to be emotional experts. Their busy brains allow them access 
to both emotional areas and language areas at the same time. Simultaneously, 
their communication skills include reading body language and facial expres­
sions. Because relationships are important to them, reading other’s minds 
through their expressions and movements has become a large part of their 
communication skills.
Reacting to stress
The male and female brains respond to stress differently. Stress in either 
brain causes the release of the fight-or-flight chemicals, adrenaline and corti­
sol. These cause blood pressure to rise and prepare the body to flee or fight. 
The male brain stops there, which means that males become agitated and try 
to release stress through competition and debating or through escape. They 
bottle up their emotions and don’t want to talk about them. Males also try to 
“play through” their stress through physical activity like golf.
Female brains let loose adrenaline and cortisol, too, but they also release 
two other chemicals: oxytocin and serotonin. Oxytocin is a bonding chemical. 
For instance, it is released in mothers and fathers upon the birth of a child 
to help them bond with and therefore care for the infant. Oxytocin has been 
called the “tend and befriend” chemical as it makes people feel close to each 
other. Females have a tendency to want to talk about and talk out their stress 

197
 Chapter 13: Understanding Male and Female Brains at Work
with others. Serotonin is a calming chemical that naturally occurs in high 
levels in the female brain. The combination of the release of these two chemi­
cals makes stress a very different experience for the female brain.
	
In high-pressure situations in the workplace, the female brain has a tendency 
to remember details and talk about them, and the male brain frames the big 
picture but does not necessarily want to talk. Having both types of brains 
onboard for such situations provides a fuller scope of the situation.
Differences in memory
The male brain has a smaller hippocampus — the brain structure that helps 
form factual memories — than the female brain. Neuroscientists believe that 
higher levels of estrogen (the “female” hormone) are responsible for this bio­
logical development. Females tend to have better memories for details.
Because the hippocampus sits next to the emotional center in the brain, the 
amygdala, memories that contain emotions are easier to remember for male 
and female brains.
	
Even though females use more emotional centers and more pathways in their 
brains for emotions, males also respond to emotional situations and emotional 
content. For this reason, adding emotion to your trainings, meetings, and pro­
fessional relationships helps your workforce and clientele remember more of 
their experiences with you.
Going with the flow
The brain is the only organ that can’t store energy and so needs constant 
feeding. Females seem to be better brain feeders. About 15 to 20 percent 
more blood flows to the female brain, bringing the oxygen and nutrients that 
feed this organ.
Female brains are active even when at rest; male brains show much less 
activity during restful states. In fact, some research suggests that male brains 
go into a state of rest under various circumstances such as stress, exhaus­
tion, and even during conversations.
Blood flow is initiated by the brain’s activity. At any given time, a female’s 
brain is more active than a male’s. In fact, the male brain requires resting 
states throughout the day, while a female brain does not. This can translate 

198
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
into a male zoning out during a meeting. A female, on the other hand, utilizes 
so many different pathways in her brain that she may easily appear off task 
as she calls on different brain areas to make connections. Keeping your male 
employees alert and your female employees on target are two important 
tasks for you as you conduct your meetings.
Understanding risky behavior
Most risk takers don’t believe that what they do is risky. The chemicals in 
their brains fill them with confidence and a feeling of control. Risk-taking and 
thrill-seeking are more common in males, who sometimes go to extremes that 
affect their health. Three young men die for every young woman. Men often 
choose riskier careers or seek thrills in their personal lives.
Risk-taking has its upsides and downsides. Frank Farley, PhD, studies risk-
taking at Temple University. He calls a risk-taking personality Type T. The T 
stands for thrill. Type Ts need a high level of stimulation.
Risk-takers can be good for business. They’re often inventors, explorers, and 
entrepreneurs. These workers may be more creative and respond positively to 
challenge, but managers need to make sure they don’t take unnecessary risk. 
	
Along with testosterone, the male brain releases adrenaline and cortisol 
during stress. In small quantities, these chemicals are motivating; in larger 
quantities, they’re a recipe for disaster. The feeling of confidence and control 
is amplified until the risk becomes greater than the reward.
Males mature later than females. This immaturity is linked to the part of 
the brain called the prefrontal cortex, located behind the forehead, where 
higher-level thinking, future planning, and decision-making are processed in 
the brain. (See Chapter 2.) A less mature prefrontal cortex may indicate less 
impulse control.
You may want to assess how your future employees respond in stressful and 
competitive situations. Impulse control is necessary when working with cli­
ents. Some corporations put their interviewees in stressful and competitive 
situations. One corporation places each potential hire in a hotel room that 
serves as his office. Over the course of the day, he’s given large stacks of doc­
uments to prioritize, sent memos for spur-of-the-moment meetings and given 
only minutes to prepare for them, and asked to negotiate problems. At the 
end of the day each interviewee must explain why he performed as he did. 
The candidates know that others competing for the same job are in the same 
hotel working on the same problem. Note the amount of risk each candidate 
is willing to take to get the job or complete a task. Many walk out of the hotel 
without notice before the end of the day.

 Chapter 13: Understanding Male and Female Brains at Work
Hearing, Listening, and Talking: 
Communication Differences
Leaders know that they need to communicate clearly to get the best out of 
people. Recognizing how males and females engage differently in two-way 
communication helps you overcome barriers and meet the needs of your 
organization.
Men really are hard of hearing
In general, women have a better sense of hearing than men. The cochlea is in 
large part the culprit. The part of the ear called the cochlea converts sound 
to nerve impulses. The male ear contains a longer cochlea, which slows down 
the brain’s recognition of sound and its response to it.
Males also have difficulty with higher pitched sounds and soft sounds. 
Female voices are often higher pitched, and so men accused of not listening 
may actually not be hearing. Women’s voices are more complex than men’s 
because of differences in the size of the larynx and vocal cords.
In schools, boys tend to sit in the back of the room and girls sit in the front. 
Teachers often find that they need to raise their voices in order to be heard 
by the boys. The girls, who are sensitive to this increased volume, are often 
upset because they think they’re being punished. In the workplace, a similar 
dynamic can unfold.
	
To prevent misunderstandings based upon the different ways in which male 
and female brains hear, you can take a number of steps:
	
✓	Educate your team as appropriate. You don’t have to hold a training 
session on the way in which males and females hear, but you can always 
get the information across in the course of normal conversations if you 
feel the issue has led to misunderstandings.
	
✓	Bring males to the front of the class. In meetings and training situa­
tions, bring the male brains to the front of the room or place them closer 
to the primary speaker.
	
✓	Get a male’s attention before speaking to him. Saying his name loudly 
or tapping his arm alerts him to pay attention to your softer tones.

200
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
	
Verbal communication is more than just words. Only 7 percent of a message is 
based on the words a person says. Tone of voice comprises 38 percent of the 
communication, and the remaining 55 percent is body language. Females do 
well with their ability to read people. However, with today’s technology, at 
least some of our communication relies on e-mails, text messages, and instant 
messaging, which offer no tone or body language for others to read and there­
fore create confusion. Choose your words very carefully when you communi­
cate by using these means. Chapter 15 goes into greater detail about 
maximizing electronic communication.
Listening cues: Understanding 
his and hers
Dr. Deborah Tannen, a Georgetown University Professor of linguistics, has 
studied communication differences in men and women at work. She found that 
	
✓	Males give little or no eye contact as they listen. They sit with others 
side by side and avoid looking at faces.
	
✓	Females sit face to face and contort their bodies in order to give and 
receive eye contact. This adds to their unique ability to read facial 
expressions and body language.
Imagine then the frustration that can occur in the female brain when speak­
ing with a male at work as he avoids looking her in the eye.
	
Understanding different listening styles helps you and your employees work 
together more harmoniously. Here’s how:
	
✓	When females realize that they aren’t being rejected by not receiving eye 
contact, they’re less stressed and work more productively.
	
✓	Accepting the female listening strategy of searching for eye contact 
keeps males from feeling that they are being targeted in some way.
He says; she says more
According to research, the average male speaks about one third as many 
words as the average female. This is an average — certainly some males 
talk a lot and some females do not. Current estimates state that males speak 
about 7,000 words a day while females clock in at 20,000 words per day. (For 
some interesting theories on what accounts for this difference check out the 
“A conversation on hunters and gatherers” sidebar in this chapter.) 

201
 Chapter 13: Understanding Male and Female Brains at Work
Conversations between men and women may be disappointing for women, 
who like to add details and feelings to the conversation and to receive them 
from the person to whom they’re speaking. Men may believe that time is 
wasted on too much conversation. An understanding of each other’s needs 
leads to better relationships and dialogue at work.
Making Meetings Work 
for Males and Females
The differences in male and female brains that this chapter highlights mean 
that male and female leaders run their meetings differently. (And what is 
work without meetings? Blissful, maybe, but probably not productive or 
realistic.) To make sure your meetings are as effective as possible, you might 
want to evaluate how you organize your meetings and address the needs of 
all of your employees.
Meetings run by male brains may
	
✓	Keep explanations short and hold descriptions to a minimum.
	
✓	Discourage responses by employees.
	
✓	Include a lot of interruptions in an effort to keep conversations short.
	
✓	Not address prior meeting conflicts or conversations. (Men tend not to 
remember them.)
A conversation on hunters and gatherers
Scientists, marriage counselors, and psycholo­
gists agree that the male brain is one of few 
words. Perhaps it goes back to the hunter/
gatherer days when men had to be silent as 
they went out hunting. Bursting into conversa­
tion would scare the prey away or turn them 
into prey. Better to hunt for lunch rather than 
be lunch.
The “survival of the fittest” interpretation is that 
a male’s offspring would never have entered 
the gene pool if Dad had not survived by suc­
cessful hunting. Perhaps that need for silence 
has carried over to our modern day.
As gatherers, women cared for children, pre­
pared food, and shared the history of their 
people with their offspring. Their need to com­
municate may have changed their brain devel­
opment to fulfill the duties that were then part 
of their survival.

202
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
	
✓	Support risk-taking.
	
✓	Downplay emotions.
	
✓	Encourage immediate action.
Meetings run by female brains may operate quite differently. These meetings
	
✓	Include lengthy explanations.
	
✓	Encourage and expect opinions from employees.
	
✓	Rely on group consensus to drive the direction or the results of the 
meeting.
	
✓	Attend to details or emotional interactions from prior meetings.
	
✓	Resolve any emotional conflicts that occur during the meeting.
	
✓	Minimize risk-taking and competition.
	
When running a meeting, keep in mind the needs and expectations of each 
gender. For the females in the workforce, allow time to offer opinions and get 
consensus. For the males, cover the main points briefly and remind them of 
prior conflicts or conversations that may be pertinent to the topic at hand. 
Balance the emotional needs with the need for action.
As you look at the employees attending your meeting, you may see very dis­
similar behaviors from males and females. Table 13-1 contains various meet­
ing scenarios and gender-based responses to be on the lookout for.

The organization can suffer as attendees lose their ability to share what might 
be brilliant ideas. Short breaks that provide movement may wake up the rest­
ing brain and provide time for dialogue for those brains that require more talk.
Competing in the Workplace
Testosterone levels rise in both males and females during competition, but 
testosterone increases more in the male brain. Just attending a competitive 
event as an audience member usually increases testosterone in both male 
and female brains. The degree to which each is a stakeholder in the event can 
affect the levels as well. (Think “hockey moms,” gamblers, and workers com­
peting for promotion.)
Males like to compete. They compete over who is brighter, stronger, faster, 
or better. Competition is motivating, activates emotional areas of the brain, 
and when used correctly enhances productivity, lowers absenteeism, and 
makes males happy. Some females prefer not to compete in the workplace. 
The female brain wants to build and maintain relationships. Interpersonal 
skills override the need to find out who is better. Females tend toward team 
work in which everyone wins.
The female’s lack of competitiveness led to the conclusion that females 
always cooperate and males always compete. That’s not quite true: Males 
actually compete very cooperatively.
The less the undercurrent of threat, the better the competition. In one Tony-
Award-winning play, employees were offered a contest. The first prize was 
a Cadillac. The second prize was a set of steak knives. The third prize was 
being fired. This kind of competition increases fear instead of motivation.
Competition comes in two flavors. Direct competition is a one-to-one experi­
ence that produces only one winner. Cooperative competition occurs when a 
team works together to achieve a goal for the good of the group. The upcom­
ing sections give you details about each form of competition.
Direct competition
Competition between two individuals can be destructive — if there can be 
only one winner, then there is always a loser. Too much competition within 
the workplace can lead to lower productivity, hard feelings, and a loss of 

204
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
focus. Anger and even hostility can arise to a point where people or teams 
won’t accept others’ ideas. As a leader, you need to carefully oversee com­
petitive situations.
Competition increases levels of chemicals like testosterone and is motivational 
in many situations. An extrinsic reward for the competition — monetary com­
pensation, extra perks, or a more prestigious position — can cause stress for 
some employees. 
Stress can be motivating, but recognizing the ways men and women handle 
stress may affect your approach to competition. Female stress and female 
competition look very much alike. Females compete in a more subtle manner 
than males, using relationships to get ahead. The extrinsic reward may be 
motivating, but most females still believe in the idea that “we’re all in this 
together.” Stress in males leads to a more aggressive approach to competi­
tion, and the extrinsic reward challenges the male brain even more.
Intrinsic rewards for competition offer another approach worth considering. 
The feeling of accomplishing a goal can be reward enough. Acknowledgment 
from management and fellow workers might be sufficient motivation to get all 
employees to work harder and contribute more to the company. Because the 
male brain likes to compete, the intrinsic reward is in winning or being the 
best. Intrinsically, female brains consider acknowledgment by others moti­
vating and yet still want others to feel good and be a part of the praise.
The question among many leaders is, “Do I praise them or raise them?” 
Offering bonuses for work well done has always been part of the business cli­
mate. Some research suggests that praising an employee in front of his peers 
motivates him or her more than money. Of course, either approach may be 
better for a particular individual. Direct competition without an extrinsic 
reward may increase productivity, but generally males respond better to 
direct competition.
Cooperative competition
In cooperative competition, a group or team sets a goal and pursues it 
together. Working together and helping each other provides not only a 
release of testosterone for motivation but also the release of the brain chemi­
cal dopamine. Dopamine is the pleasure chemical and is also involved in the 
feeling of bonding. Oxytocin, which enhances bonding, is also released.
The brain strongly desires these feel-good chemicals, and so the team is 
intrinsically motivated. They want to continue to have these good feelings 
and be a part of something greater than themselves. Research suggests that 

205
 Chapter 13: Understanding Male and Female Brains at Work
team composition works best if teams are divided by gender or have an 
equal gender split. A feeling of being a minority in any team is a problem. For 
instance, a team of four men and two women often results in the women con­
tributing less. Mixed teams generate better ideas than single-sex teams.
Working toward a personal best is also a healthy cooperative type of com­
petition. For example, each employee tries to raise her level of productivity 
not in competition with others but rather in competition with her own estab­
lished best. The collaborative groups support each person’s quest to excel. 
Post a team chart that shows each individual’s current production rate. 
Together the team brainstorms ideas that work for each individual. Individual 
workers implement strategies; results are tracked on the chart. The whole 
team celebrates a person’s increases.
	
Using competition in the workplace can be healthy and productive. Teams 
made up of males and females may bring different ways of thinking about the 
goals to the table. All-male teams are more likely to become overly competitive.
Considering competition and reward in action
A distribution company I worked with on sales 
motivation offered a trip based on sales to win­
ning dealers. The trip was extravagant and 
offered leisure activities as well as competitive 
sports. (Keep in mind that the competitive games 
may have increased testosterone levels in the 
males.) During the trip, the dealership owners 
competed with their local competitors as well 
as those outside their own territories. Dealers 
received awards at a gala evening event. One 
of the top producers for the distributor had been 
receiving awards at these functions for years. 
This high-producing dealership was owned by 
a man and a woman who were stunned when 
their names weren’t called to receive a sales 
award. The dealership had failed to meet the 
specific qualifications for the award.
Angry and embarrassed, the dealers left the 
room, checked out of the hotel, and hopped on 
an early flight home. Their account manager 
thought surely he would lose the dealership’s 
business forever. He immediately went to 
meet with these clients upon returning home. 
Although the male owner was still upset, he 
looked at the facts when the account man­
ager gave him the data and copies of memos 
that had been sent to the dealership detail­
ing what they were in need of accomplishing 
for the award. The female owner and partner, 
however, refused to give the account manager 
a meeting and remained angry with him until 
he used brain research suggestions for deal­
ing with the female brain. He asked her how 
she felt while looking her directly in the eyes. 
He showed empathy for her distress at losing 
the award, and then showed her the data and 
discussed how they, as a team, could move for­
ward. The dealership continued doing business 
with the distribution company.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Checking Out Working 
Relationships in Action
While training a regional group of team leaders on male and female brain dif­
ferences, many of the brain differences in this chapter presented themselves. 
Here’s what went down and how the actions illustrated the concepts in this 
chapter:
	
1.	Matt, one of the younger participants, interrupted my opening 
remarks to reject this material immediately.
	
	 “I want to see the research on this,” he began. “I know this won’t make a 
difference with my team. I know how to lead men and women.” His male 
brain showed competitive stress.
	
2.	Before I could respond, Paul, another team leader, spoke up.
	
	 “This research has been around for awhile. Don’t you read trade jour­
nals?” he looked directly at Matt. Paul was having a competitive reaction.
	
3.	One of the female leaders, Tammy, very quietly explained Matt’s 
behavior.
	
	 “Don’t take this personally. Matt just has to get his two cents in. He 
doesn’t mean anything by it. Most of the women on his team tend to 
ignore him. They’ve tried talking to him, but they mostly feel sorry for 
him because he’s so young.” Her female brain reacted empathetically.
	
	 Tammy smiled at me. She then slumped over her place at the table as if 
to remove herself from the loud remarks. Her female brain was shutting 
down from the bossiness.
	
4.	Tall, confident Oscar stood up and commanded the others.
	
	 “Let’s just get on with this! We aren’t going to know if any of this is true 
unless we get to the details.” His male brain wanted just the facts.
	
5.	Everyone’s attention turned to me.
	
	 I wanted to ask everyone how they were feeling. My female brain focuses 
on relationships. But I knew better and so asked the team leaders to par­
ticipate in a short activity to get the men moving and give the women a 
chance to talk. I continued the training a few minutes later.
At the end of the training, Matt still wasn’t sure that I had proven anything. 
I asked the leaders to get in small groups and discuss what had happened 
during the day that would tend to corroborate the research findings about 
the differences between the male and female brain. As they shared their anec­
dotal evidence collected from that single day’s training, even Matt couldn’t 
deny that there was something to this research.

Y
ou can’t be a leader if you have no followers. Your teams are the vehi­
cles through which you get the job done. With the multiple generations 
you probably have in your organization, creating teams can be challenging 
but interesting.
Everyone in your organizations must live up to your expectations. They must 
be productive and creative change agents. Building teams and making them 
work can increase motivation, productivity, relationships, self-confidence, 
and timing throughout your organization.
Just as a sports team works together to accomplish goals, work-related teams 
progress toward the organization’s goals as well as their own specialized 
goals. You choose the expert team that runs your organization. Individual 
agendas, egos, or career status cannot enter the picture.
In this chapter, you find out about building the right team, setting goals, mon­
itoring progress, and encouraging everyone along the way — you’re not just 
the leader, you’re the head cheerleader, too!
Building an Executive Team
Your executive team is going to be the most important group of people you 
need (besides investors). This is the “first” team and must consist of those 
people who make your business run, make it profitable, solve problems that 
you don’t need to be involved in, and help you solve other business problems.

208
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
So, who is on first? You or the person you designate to run the show for 
you. You are the ultimate decision-maker. The buck definitely stops with 
you when it comes to taking responsibility for mistakes, failures, and 
miscommunications.
Other members of your first, or senior, team depend on the kind of business 
you are running. Large and small organizations have some executive team 
members with similar responsibilities, but a retailer and a wholesaler have 
some differences, and so do a physician’s office and a nonprofit organization.
Fill the jobs with the right people. Sometimes these people are available 
within your organization, other times you need to go elsewhere to find them. 
Look for the following in your leadership team:
	
✓	Leaders who are interested in and have knowledge of every aspect of 
your business; even though they lead their own departments, they have 
a good understanding of the business as a whole
	
✓	Leaders who can help make decisions, even though some of the deci­
sions may not directly impact their department
	
✓	Leaders who can see the vertical dynamics (communication that goes in 
a top-down fashion) and the horizontal dynamics (communication across 
levels) and can switch from one to the other
	
✓	Leaders who don’t criticize after a decision is made
	
✓	Leaders who are excellent role models
Your executive team is going to help you make decisions, move the organiza­
tion forward, and keep you informed about what’s going on in every depart­
ment. This team should be able to get you through the rough times, help you 
celebrate successes, and determine how you’re going to reach your goals.
Keeping this team functioning at its highest level is a challenge for every 
leader. Everything may be going well, and then complacency sets in. To keep 
this team running smoothly try the following:
	
✓	Cultivate collaboration: Have a meeting before the meeting to build 
community and get to know each other better.
	
✓	Promote trust: Show your vulnerabilities, admit mistakes, and ask for 
feedback.
	
✓	Make the time for off-site meetings: Hold two- or three-day retreats with 
a facilitator. Getting away from the office provides a fresh perspective, 
and because employees can’t tend directly to office business, they stay 
focused on the meeting.

209
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
Discovering How Teams Develop
All teams go through developmental stages, just as the brain does. The 
upcoming sections detail the way a group of people matures into a team.
Infancy 
During the infancy or forming stage, everyone is excited about entering this 
new world, doesn’t really know the team members, and has little idea about 
what the vision, mission, expectations, or norms of the team will be. Members 
are tentative as they determine whether they can trust their fellow players. 
Just as the brain during infancy is making new connections, adapting to its 
environment, and learning from experiences, so is the newly formed team.
At this stage of team development, the team members have the following 
needs:
	
✓	Getting to know each other
	
✓	Discovering their roles and the roles of other team members
	
✓	Defining the team’s purpose, values, and norms
	
✓	Reaching harmony on authority and on personal and professional 
boundaries
	
✓	Outlining decision-making processes
At this stage, the team reviews the vision statement and mission statement. 
All teams within your organization require a team purpose. Every team’s pur­
pose is to model both the vision and the mission statements.
During the infancy stage, the team develops its own team norms. Norms are 
the ground rules for the individual and team behaviors. For instance, one 
norm shared with me by a leader is “early is on-time; on-time is late.” In other 
words, meetings must start at the designated time. In order to accomplish 
this, every team member must be present, seated, and ready to begin at the 
designated meeting start time. Getting there just in the nick of time causes 
the meeting to begin late.
	
Each team sets its own goals based on the goals of the entire organization. 
Infancy is a “getting to know each other” period and a time to set up the frame­
work for the work. Teams really depend on their leaders during this stage, 
which can last a few months.

210
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
The leader’s tasks include the following:
	
✓	Help the team outline its values and goals
	
✓	Help team members get to know each other
	
✓	Guide the team in setting up their norms
	
✓	Provide structure by scheduling regular meetings
Adolescence
Adolescence refers to the stage in which the team seek more independence. 
This stage of development is one of the necessary evils associated with teams, 
but its outcome is really what makes a group a cohesive team. Some call this 
stage of development storming, and if you remember your own adolescence or 
have raised an adolescent, you can understand how well this stage fits with the 
behaviors that result from the growth of the adolescent brain.
Adolescents often are
	
✓	Moody
	
✓	Difficult to work with
	
✓	Emotional
Playing nice within teams
You can compare the infancy stage of a team to 
early social development. Children begin “play­
ing” by standing next to each other and playing 
with individual toys. As they gain confidence 
and trust, they begin to play with another child, 
and eventually move on to small groups and 
then larger groups.
Individuals who have been assigned to a team 
may be smiling and excited to be on the team, 
but most know little of what is expected of them. 
They may not know who’s in charge, and they 
may wonder who to trust. They may introduce 
themselves to those sitting on either side of 
them. For the most part, interaction is minimal. 
As with the small children, the team members 
play side by side.
At the next meeting, team members are a bit 
more relaxed and may have small group discus­
sions as the leader reviews and revisits infor­
mation from the previous meeting. They may 
have run into their team mates while at work 
and may feel some camaraderie with them. The 
leader may provide a “get to know each other” 
activity to help define roles and create a climate 
of trust. All of the “kids” are playing together 
instead of side by side.

211
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
	
✓	Confrontational
	
✓	Frustrated
	
✓	Confused
	
✓	Challenged by communication
	
✓	Convinced that they are incompetent or have low self-esteem
	
✓	Prone to unrealistic expectations
The adolescent brain is underdeveloped in areas of decision-making, control­
ling emotions, and understanding consequences. As this brain develops, all of 
these areas improve and the brain begins to work in a more cohesive fashion.
Characteristics of the storming stage of team development include
	
✓	Conflict
	
✓	Frustration with authority
	
✓	Confusion with goals, mission, and norms
	
✓	Desire for independence from leader
	
✓	Lack of self-confidence
	
✓	Unrealistic expectations
The team, like the adolescent brain, can mature and learn to work produc­
tively. The emotional and social intelligence of the team is an important 
aspect of becoming a productive and healthy group of people who understand 
each other’s differences and can work together using those differences to 
make change. And as one leader said, “Change is good. But I prefer dollars!”
The adolescent stage can last a few months. The leader assists in this stage 
by doing the following:
	
✓	Helping the team resolve conflicts: You might need to remind the team 
of their previously established rules.
	
✓	Building trust: Share stories about some of the problems your own team 
has faced.
	
✓	Encouraging independence: Allow them to speak freely.
	
✓	Being prepared for challenges: Assist them in planning to achieve their 
goals.
The challenge for this stage of development is to firm up the goals and 
norms. If the leader steps back and lets team members make their own deci­
sions, the team will become less dependent on her.

212
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Maturity
When the brain reaches maturity, it begins to function at a higher level. High-
level thinking skills, problem-solving, and attention to goals and roles lead 
to better decision-making. The mature brain controls emotions and reads 
others’ emotions; its improved ability to handle relationships means that the 
brain can be more productive, be more task- and goal-oriented, and feel more 
like part of the team.
At this stage of team development, sometimes referred to as the norming 
stage, you may see these characteristics:
	
✓	Focus on specific topics
	
✓	Dividing into smaller groups to accomplish more
	
✓	Reviewing previous accomplishments and seeking areas of improvement
	
✓	More commitment to vision, mission, and goals
	
✓	Spending more time on decision-making
	
✓	More energy to produce
	
✓	Respect and trust among team members
	
✓	Cohesiveness
A mature brain has a developed prefrontal cortex; as Chapter 2 details, this 
area of the brain integrates information from all other areas and gets a ratio­
nal picture of what is happening. The prefrontal cortex also is aware of emo­
tions and works with them, so the mature brain is much like a team beginning 
to truly work together. At this stage, team members start talking in terms of 
the team instead of just themselves. The team has taken shape and can now 
make great strides.
The leader is more of a coach for a team at this stage and should do the 
following:
	
✓	Provide feedback to guide them toward the goal
	
✓	Continue building positive relationships
	
✓	Help focus on specific areas of productivity
	
✓	Assess team function
	
✓	Continue to address conflict
At the maturity stage, the team is closer to becoming a powerful entity for 
your organization. Its members have learned from the first three stages of 
development. The team needs a few more months to move to the next stage.

213
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
Wisdom
As the brain continues to develop beyond the maturity level, one of the most 
respected aspects of humanity, wisdom, develops. Team wisdom is a com­
bination of knowledge and skills that enable the team to solve problems and 
make decisions easily. People become wiser by working with others, and they 
become better able to make decisions that produce positive results.
	
Dendrites, the fibers in brain cells that receive information, continue to form 
and grow longer when you learn. As they grow, more and more tiers of fibers 
develop in order to receive messages. The highest tiers that indicate the 
achievement of wisdom. Turn to Chapter 2 to find out more about how brain 
cells grow.
Wisdom comes from experience. Your team is now achieving wisdom. This 
stage is often called the performing stage. And you have given them the stage 
on which to perform!
Characteristics of the wise team include the following:
	
✓	Problem-solving proficiency
	
✓	Clear purpose
	
✓	Shared leadership
	
✓	Optimal productivity
	
✓	High levels of motivation and drive
	
✓	Initiative 
	
✓	High level of team loyalty
	
✓	Relationships built on trust and experiences
	
✓	Respect for individual differences and the need to disagree
	
✓	Quick conflict resolution
As the wise team works toward its goals, you see continuous improvement 
and soaring productivity. They regulate themselves and make changes to 
their goals as necessary. This team still has needs. Those needs include the 
following:
	
✓	Autonomy to make decisions
	
✓	Continued professional development
	
✓	New challenges
	
✓	Recognition of accomplishments
	
✓	Celebrations of individual and team accomplishments

214
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
The high-performance team continues to gain wisdom as it helps you create 
the organization that meets your vision and your goals. Allowing every team 
the time and guidance to move from stage to stage is the responsibility of 
every leader.
Leading a Team from 
Without and Within
Leading your organization requires you to sometimes be on the outside 
watching teams achieve goals, or you may be completely involved in their 
work. As teams go through various stages, you may have to change your 
leadership style to fit their level of maturation. In this section, I share how to 
match your style, how to find others to help hold teams together, and how to 
train team leaders.
Matching your leadership style 
to your team’s stage
As your teams develop, you may wonder which leadership style you need for 
each. (Check out Chapter 6 to get more information about leadership styles.) 
You can compare the process of leading to a classroom.
When class begins and the students don’t know content, methods, or pro­
cedures, the instructor’s job is to run the classroom — that is, to take an 
authoritarian approach to leadership. The authoritarian leader takes respon­
sibility for running things. Telling others what to do and how to do it are part 
of this process. The infancy stage of team development requires a lot of guid­
ance, and therefore an authoritarian leadership style works best.
The adolescent stage is a bit different. Although this stage includes a lot of 
dissatisfaction, much learning is taking place. This stage requires a slow 
leadership change. The leader begins with an authoritarian style to begin this 
stage, but as the “adolescents” learn, they need some leeway. Thus, the lead­
ership style changes to a more democratic style.
	
The adolescent team is going through major developmental changes. As the 
changes occur, you must give the team opportunities to begin making some 
decisions and weighing risks that it might previously have automatically taken.
The maturity stage occurs when the team members are really learning to 
figure things out. They are working together but still need some guidance. 

215
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
The democratic style works well with the maturity stage. Members seek 
input and make decisions under the guidance of their team leader. This is a 
productive stage, but it’s still a learning stage. You need to do some coaching 
and support the work being done.
Socrates said that wisdom comes to each of us when we realize how little we 
know. The wisdom stage for teams requires little coaching, yet some support. 
When a team reaches this stage, switch to the delegative style of leadership. 
The team is ready to make its own decisions and may only occasionally need 
the support or advice of a leader.
Finding (or fostering) the glue people
Sometimes teams can find themselves in sticky situations. Even though they 
have managed to make their way through the four stages of team develop­
ment, problems can occur. Even those in the wisdom stage of development 
can come across areas of dissension. This often occurs when a team member 
leaves a team or new members join.
One way of finding the balance and recreating the climate is to find what 
Daniel Goleman (author of Emotional Intelligence) calls the glue people— 
those who help hold things together with their high emotional intelligence. 
Friendly, interested, and positive team members set the stage for others as 
newcomers enter and others leave teams. 
When the team runs into a problem with the work or interpersonal clashes, 
these glue people smooth the edges and assist in coming to terms with the 
problems. Team members such as these may be hard to come by, but you 
can develop them through emotional and social training.
As you assemble teams, be conscious of the value of the glue people and try 
to place one on each team. If you find yourself lacking qualified people with 
this skill, remember that it is a skill that can be learned. Select people you 
feel are destined to help your organization reach its goals and provide train­
ing in emotional intelligence.
Training team leaders
When it comes to the senior team, you may indeed be the leader. But what 
about your other teams? As you create them, or as your senior team con­
structs the teams they need for their department goals, discuss how the lead­
ers of these teams will be chosen and trained.

216
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
You may choose team leaders based on need, availability, and — if you’re 
lucky — positive team experience. The experienced team member has at 
least felt what going through the team-development process is like. She may 
not be able to name the stages of development, but she can relate to them as 
they are explained.
In most team leader trainings, the first step is for each team leader to 
describe a team experience in as much detail as he can remember. Make 
this a written assignment that is then shared in small groups to save time. 
Another useful activity is creating a list of ideal team leader characteristics. 
You do this in several stages:
	
1.	Each team leader writes down the first name of her favorite team 
leader and lists the characteristics that made this leader great.
	
2.	Each team leader writes down the first name of a team leader that she 
did not enjoy working with and lists the characteristics of this team 
leader.
	
3.	Each team leader writes down how each of these leaders made her feel.
	
4.	In small groups, the team leaders discuss the characteristics of both 
leaders and create a chart with positive team leader characteristics on 
the left side and negative characteristics on the right side.
	
5.	Display each small group’s charts and discuss the characteristics as a 
whole group.
	
6.	From these charts, create the definitive characteristics of a great team 
leader.
The information you obtain from this exercise is a great anchor for training. 
From this point, I suggest the following steps for training:
	
1.	Review the styles of leadership that Chapter 6 describes.
	
2.	Define the stages of team development that the section “Discovering 
How Teams Develop” outlines.
	
3.	Allow participants to share experiences that they’ve had in each of 
these stages.
	
4.	Let participants in small groups discover which leadership style would 
be most effective at each team development stage.
	
5.	Provide scenarios in which the leader may need to change style 
during team development.
	
6.	Discuss the importance of glue people.
	
7.	Review the emotional intelligence competencies that Chapter 8 details.
	
8.	Role play scenarios in which the team leader uses his emotional intel­
ligence to defuse conflicts in a meeting.

217
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
	
9.	Discuss ways to build trust among team members and between the 
team leader and the team members.
	
10.	Model and share activities in which team members can get to know 
each other.
	
11.	Offer example problems and discuss who on the team should be 
making decisions to solve them.
And we’re on the same team: 
A team-building activity
One of the most effective team activities for 
helping members get to know each other is one 
that I have used numerous times, and always 
with great results. It’s fun, too! I call it “and 
we’re on the same team” because it involves 
finding commonalities among people. The pro­
cess is simple. Remember musical chairs? This 
activity is similar. Here are the steps:
	 1.	 Each participant brings her chair to a des­
ignated area of the room.
	 2.	 Participants form a circle with each chair 
touching the next. Leave no spaces.
	 3.	 Each participant sits down while I begin 
the activity by standing in the center of the 
circle.
	 4.	 I introduce myself by saying, “Hello, I’m 
Marilee.”
	 5.	 Each participant responds with “Hello, 
Marilee!”
	 6.	 I then make a statement about myself that 
may or may not be true about someone 
else in the group. For instance, I may say, 
“I enjoy working with a team.” I follow this 
statement with the phrase, “and we’re on 
the same team!”
	 7.	 I ask participants to stand up if they also 
enjoy working with a team. 
	 8.	 The standing participants and I try to sit 
down in someone else’s seat. 
	 9.	 The person who is left without a seat stands 
in the center and follows the same process.
	10.	 This process continues until everyone has 
been in the center or whatever time is allot­
ted is up.
You find out interesting information from this 
activity. From my first statement, if all are 
truthful, I know who likes teamwork and who 
doesn’t. The other statements may reveal 
personal information about the people. For 
instance, someone may say, “I played colle­
giate sports,” and those who also played rise. 
You also get to know people’s names.
The activity provides movement, which gets 
blood and oxygen flowing to the brain and stim­
ulates the brain to release dopamine — a plea­
surable reward that helps participants focus 
as the meeting continues. And I have never 
had a group that didn’t end up laughing during 
the activity. Laughing also releases feel-good 
chemicals in the brain.
The last statement, “and we’re on the same 
team” emphasizes the goal of the group spend­
ing time together. You can vary this activity by 
making the statement more specific to your 
immediate needs — for example, “and we’re 
going to increase productivity!”

218
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Leading introductory team meetings
Any first team meeting can be awkward — people don’t know what to expect 
or exactly how they fit in. When you train team leaders, show them how to 
make every meeting an experience. First meetings may simply be “getting to 
know you” meetings. If the team is a large one that will be broken down into 
smaller teams, the first meeting is the time to divvy up team members.
Here’s a first-meeting plan that gets a project moving and gives team mem­
bers a chance to get to know each other:
	
1.	Each person introduces himself.
	
2.	Create your mini-teams, and separate the teams within the room.
	
3.	Let each team get acquainted with simple questions or activities.
	
	 You may ask them to introduce themselves and then share three things 
with the team, one of which is false. The rest of the team tries to guess 
through questioning which statement was false.
	
4.	Determine mini-team leaders.
	
	 You can let team members vote for a leader, but this option works best 
if team members already are acquainted. I often ask each person in the 
team whether they want to be the team leader. If I get multiple yeses, the 
volunteers may share leadership. If there are no yeses, I go around again 
until I eventually get a leader.
	
5.	Give each team about three minutes to come up with a team name.
	
	 Yes, a name. Every sports team has a name. Why not a business team?
	
6.	Each team makes up a team cheer.
	
	 Cheers make people smile or laugh. They get people up and breathing 
deeply. These results enhance thinking. If you wish, have each team pick 
team colors or a logo.
	
7.	Each team leader introduces her team to the larger group.
	
	The team then says its cheer. Applause is encouraged and modeled by 
the leadership.
	
8.	Schedule and set up the team meetings that follow.
	
9.	End the meeting by asking each team to name one goal that they have 
for the next meeting.
	
	 For example, one team may say they want to know everyone’s name on 
their team, or they may want to contact each other by e-mail or text by 
the next meeting.
The teams are assembled, the team leader has been trained, the mini-team 
leaders are selected, and that may be enough for one day.

219
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
Running routine team meetings
For brain-compatible meetings that keep their attention and make time fly as 
you meet the needs of your team members and keep the team on track, I sug­
gest the following:
	
✓	Play music that sets the tone of the meeting. “Mission Impossible” for a 
challenge and problem-solving; “Whistle While You Work” for finishing 
up details. Or make your climate inviting in some other way. For exam­
ple, welcome posters, standing at the door and shaking each person’s 
hand, or offering a high-five.
	
✓	Use humor. Start with a story that relates to your team or its purpose.
	
✓	Review your goal for this meeting. Get consensus on that goal.
	
✓	Have a printed agenda for each person. If you’ve sent the agenda prior 
to the meeting, a quick request for changes or additions is appropriate 
and makes everyone feel included.
	
✓	Ask for feedback from the previous meeting.
	
✓	Ask each mini-team to do its cheer whenever it completes a task. Doing 
so lets others know that they’re finished and may inspire others to 
commit to finishing their task more quickly.
Setting Goals
Goal setting is vital to the success of every team. Setting goals gives the 
brain a focus, it also increases performance — especially if the team helps 
to set its own goals. Of course, these goals are based on the goals of the 
organization itself.
	
The brain sees a goal as an extension of itself; it takes ownership of the goal 
and the accomplishment. Neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, 
which I describe in Chapter 2, are released in the brain as goals are set and 
worked toward. If the brain truly desires the goal, it is rewarded along the way 
to the achievement by the release of these chemicals. However, if the goal is 
not achieved, these chemicals are withheld and the individual feels bad. The 
brain therefore makes every effort to reach its goals.
SMART goals
A goal is a statement that usually focuses on attainment in one to three years. 
Goals are action statements. The goal-setting process is simplified by the 
often-used process of writing SMART goals. The following characteristics 
make up this acronym:

220
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
	
✓	Specific: Each goal specifies your target exactly. For instance, increasing 
sales may be your goal, but it’s not specific enough. Increasing sales by 
10 percent is much more specific.
	
✓	Measurable: One of the big problems with setting goals is knowing when 
you have met them. In other words, you must be able to evaluate your 
success. Increasing sales by 10 percent is measurable if you have the 
data on present sales.
	
✓	Achievable: A goal that is within your reach increases motivation and 
those brain chemicals that keep you or your team motivated. If you 
wanted to increase sales by 50 percent, your sales staff may see that 
goal as impossible to achieve and give up before they begin. The 10 per­
cent mark, however, may be very possible for the sales team if they have 
a reasonable amount of time to achieve it.
	
✓	Realistic: A realistic goal is one that your team has the resources to real­
ize. If the team has the skills it needs to increase sales, you have enough 
of the product to sell, you have plenty of customers in your sales area, 
and you have time to get the job done, the goal is realistic.
	
✓	Time: SMART goals are written with an end in mind. Increasing sales by 10 
percent by the end of the next fiscal year provides a deadline. If you don’t 
have a deadline, the goal is too vague and the target is unclear. Time is a 
motivational factor in achieving goals. (I want to lose ten pounds is a goal. 
But I want to lose ten pounds by Christmas provides a deadline.)
After you set your SMART goals, you want to examine who is going to be 
involved in reaching the goals. Ideally, everyone in the company plays a part 
in this process. For example, imagine your company’s goal is to increase 
sales by 10 percent in the next fiscal year. This goal is lofty. The next step 
in working with this goal is to determine how it can be broken down into 
smaller goals. Who in your organization will be involved? Your senior team 
leads their teams in the following ways:
	
✓	Chief Technology Officer: This executive’s team may be involved by 
creating an easier or more proficient way to keep track of sales, contact 
current customers, and expedite information to get products distributed 
more quickly.
	
✓	Marketing Director: A new or improved marketing program for the 
product may be designed by the marketing team.
	
✓	Sales Leader: Motivating and assisting sales teams can be one way 
that this leader contributes. The sales teams may create new sales 
approaches and new contact lists.
	
✓	Customer Support Leader: Communicating with customers the kind of 
support they will receive after purchasing this product may encourage 
an increase in sales. The customer support teams design print informa­
tion that each customer will receive.

221
 Chapter 14: Making Teams Work
	
✓	Chief Financial Officer: The finance teams track production, sales, 
and distribution of products as well as allocate funds for promotional 
purposes. They also determine rewards for reaching goals to increase 
production.
	
✓	Chief Operating Officer: All senior team leaders report to the COO so 
that she can oversee all aspects of this targeted goal and keep depart­
ments up to date.
The SMART approach is linear, logical, and very left-brain oriented. Those 
teams that think in a left-brained format appreciate this type of goal setting. It 
is easy to track and measure goals that are created by this approach.
SAFE goals
If your teams consist of members who are creative, visual, and right-
hemisphere dominant, SMART goals may not be motivating enough for 
them. Approaching goals in a nonlinear manner appeals more to the right 
hemisphere. You may want to consider a more global approach for reach­
ing those goals. SAFE goals approach goals a bit differently. SAFE is an 
acronym for the following:
	
✓	See it. See yourself working toward that goal. For example, picture 
yourself increasing sales. Perhaps you visualize yourself approaching 
old customers and sharing valuable information about the product you 
sell. You then picture yourself calling on new prospects and pitching the 
product to them. Picture the goal already achieved.
	
✓	Accept it. Picture yourself working toward the goal and accept that you 
can achieve it. Accept the recognition you might get and the rewards 
your company will receive from the sales.
	
✓	Feel it. Adding emotion to your visualization is powerful. Feel good 
about your accomplishment. Enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done. 
Through visualization you can actually cause your brain to release 
dopamine and other brain chemicals that make you feel good.
	
✓	Express it. Visualize yourself telling others about the accomplishment 
and giving presentations at your team meetings about how you contrib­
uted to the accomplishment of this goal.
The SAFE method is especially good for those brains that need to have the 
big picture in order to accept the fact that they can accomplish their goals. 
You may not need to use SAFE for every goal of the organization or team, but 
it may help those who doubt their capability of attaining certain goals.

222
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Keeping Score
Teams keep score. Doing so may cause healthy competition among teams 
or mini-teams. But keeping score really gives the team some reflection time 
to assess themselves. First, they get to rate themselves on how well they’re 
achieving their goals. They then get to compare themselves to other teams 
who may be having more success. When the team leaders explain their 
team’s successes and failures, make sure they have time for feedback or 
brainstorming to help them try a different approach.
You have many options for making team work more visible to the team and 
to others. Sparking healthy competition may be just what a struggling area of 
your organization needs. Scorecards in the form of charts, posters, or other 
graphics remind the team players who’s getting the job done and offer oppor­
tunities for coaching and mentoring.
You may want each mini-team to create a team chart — a score card of sorts. 
It includes categories that relate to your purpose and the individual purpose 
of each mini-team. The team fills in the chart as a form of self-assessment, 
and may be used as a vehicle for reporting to the rest of the teams at weekly 
or monthly meetings.
Using the goal of increasing sales by 10 percent by the end of the fiscal year, 
a team’s scorecard may consist of any or all of the following:
	
✓	Dollars and cents: Keep a running total of team sales on a weekly or 
monthly basis.
	
✓	Number of units sold: Display a weekly or monthly tally of products 
sold by the team.
	
✓	Percentage increases: Display a tally sheet of the sales increases thus 
far by percentage.
	
✓	Countdown tally: Figure the total number of units that the team needs 
to sell to reach the goal. (“X units to go till deadline.”)
	
Keep teams informed in a timely manner of how they’re progressing toward 
goals. Making the information graphic ensures that all team members see 
progress and that conversations begin over known results. You may need to 
change your approach from a countdown to a celebratory graphic of units 
sold if confidence is low or you’re in an off season.

▶	Discovering digital differences
▶	Communicating across the generations
▶	Appealing to workers of all generations
T
he brain is plastic. Our experiences change the brain’s structure and 
function. Research shows us that if you use your brain to specialize in 
specific tasks, you literally change it. Perhaps you decide you want to learn a 
musical instrument — a wonderful way to keep your brain young and to make 
new connections. From practicing and playing the violin, the areas in your 
brain that control your finger movements make new connections and prob­
ably grow new brain cells.
The business world today is comprised mainly of those whose brains have 
changed from constantly using technology, and those whose brains are only 
beginning to change as they slowly come on board. If you don’t fit into either 
of these categories, it’s time to join the global world.
If you’re saying to yourself, “it’s too hard to keep up,” or “this too shall pass,” 
get over it. You’re wrong on both counts. With practice, you can catch up 
and keep up.
In this chapter, you meet your own generation and the generations you have 
to deal with in business. Your leadership skills must include understanding 
the way the brain adapts to our rapidly building technological advances. If 
a digital divide exists in your organization, you must lead the way to closing 
the gap. This chapter shows you how the brain adapts to rapid changes in 
communication, problem-solving, and creativity. You also find out how to 
work with brains that need face-to-face practice and emotional intelligence 
training because they have spent so much time in the global world communi­
cating without face time, without gestures, and sometimes without meaning.

Generations Apart: Touching 
on Generational Identities
No one seems to understand the younger generation — no matter which gen­
eration that is. Several generations are at work in most organizations. Their 
ages and stages in the digital world make a difference in how they interact 
and work in the real world.
Some of you can’t live without your digital doohickeys; others yearn for the 
days when you didn’t feel you had to be connected at all times. Maybe you 
remember when you saw your first television program in color or when your 
family bought the first TV set. Or you maybe feel television is too passive to 
be entertaining. You send text messages constantly and think e-mail is too 
slow. In this section I introduce you to the generations currently in our work­
force, describing some of their common characteristics and ways of working.
Traditionalists
Anyone born before 1946 is a member of the silent generation, the 
Traditionalists. These people come from the Depression era and know hard­
ship from their own personal experiences or from their parents, who were 
farmers or who immigrated to this country.
Although Traditionalists are at retirement age, many of them still work. They 
may be valuable employees or leaders, but they likely work with three or 
four other generations, and that isn’t easy for someone with a Traditionalist’s 
values and work ethic.
Traditionalists expect to work from 9 to 5 but are willing to put in extra hours 
as well. Traditionalists tend to be loyal; many have kept the same job or have 
had few jobs in their lifetime. Many of the silent generation thought it appro­
priate that Mother stayed at home while Father worked. Raising the children 
was the wife’s major responsibility.
Certain actions define each generation. For the Traditionalists, World War II, 
the Korean War, and the Great Depression were formative events. Each genera­
tion has an overlap. So some individuals born before or during World War II fit 
into the Boomer generation in which both spouses work for the extra income.

225
 Chapter 15: Overcoming the Digital Divide
Traditionalists have a much more conventional work ethic than other genera­
tions. Characteristics that this generation is known for include:
	
✓	Hard-working
	
✓	Private
	
✓	Respectful toward authority
	
✓	Packrats
	
✓	Loyal
	
✓	Dedicated
	
✓	Formal in dress and manners
	
✓	Sacrifice for their families and their employers
	
✓	Believe work is a privilege
Baby Boomers
Those who fit into the well-known generation of Baby Boomers were born 
between 1946 and 1964. As couples put off having babies until the end of 
World War II, when the husbands returned, families grew. A lot of babies 
were born as the country flourished — 78 million, in fact. The events that 
define this generation are the Cold War, the civil rights movement, space 
travel, and the assassinations of high-level, influential people.
All Boomers grew up in a time during which most everyone had jobs. They 
enjoyed spending their money and were introduced to the credit card era. Many 
Boomers like to take care of themselves, stay young-looking, and buy gadgets.
As far as technology is concerned, Boomers grew up with television. In the 
earlier days, Boomers and their ancestors gathered around the radio and 
listened to shows like Big John and Sparky; they used their imaginations and 
visualized the stories. Television took those pictures out of their minds and 
put them on a screen in front of them. For the first time, people saw news sto­
ries firsthand and the horrors of war were revealed to all.
This generation believes in standing up for one’s rights; they were part of the 
women’s movement and the civil rights movement. The good news and the 
bad news for the Boomers is that with medical advances, they are going to 
live a long time. Many of them did not prepare for retirement and will remain 
in the workforce well past the age of 65.

226
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Because this generation is so large, they’re targeted by businesses. Health 
care, beauty programs, exercise programs, and brain programs aim at 
Boomers who want to live forever, avoid Alzheimer’s disease, and look 
younger.
Boomers tend to
	
✓	Be hard-working
	
✓	Love prestige
	
✓	Believe in working long days and long weeks
	
✓	Encourage group decision-making
	
✓	Compete with others both inside and outside work
	
✓	Work past retirement age
	
✓	Achieve goals
	
✓	Do volunteer work
	
✓	Value personal growth
	
✓	Believe in the equality of the sexes
	
✓	Question authority
	
✓	Like teamwork
Generation X
Between 1965 and 1980, about 50 million people were born in the United 
States. This group has been dubbed Generation X. This era is defined by 
Watergate, the fall of the Berlin Wall, Desert Storm, and the energy crisis.
This age bracket faced high unemployment and saw parents getting laid off. 
It’s one of the best-educated groups in history and use their education to set 
their own personal goals and create a life much different from their parents’.
This generation values parenting more than work. They prepare themselves 
to be flexible and portable. Loyalty to one company or employer is not impor­
tant to this group. They want to create a job for themselves that caters to 
their personal needs and goals.
Many of the workers of this era are
	
✓	Hard-working
	
✓	Protective of family time

227
 Chapter 15: Overcoming the Digital Divide
	
✓	Ambitious
	
✓	More comfortable with flexibility in their jobs
	
✓	Drawn to diversity
	
✓	Attracted to challenge
	
✓	Open to input
	
✓	Creative
	
✓	Protective of freedom and independence
	
✓	Unimpressed with authority
	
✓	Seeking experience so they can move on to the next job
Generation Y: The ’Net Generation
People born between 1977 and 1997 have accumulated several names. They 
are sometimes called Generation Y, because they follow Gen X-ers; occa­
sionally they’re referred to as the Millenials; and some call them the Echo 
Boomers because they’re a rather large population. But they are most often 
referred to as the ’Net Generation.
Columbine and other school shootings, the Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky 
scandal, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the technology boom are the sig­
nificant events of this generation.
Because these people were exposed to different lifestyles and cultures while 
in school, they embrace diversity. Communication is their strength; tech­
nology is their world. Raised with digital tools, they’re connected to more 
people all over the globe than any of the generations.
Many members of the ’Net generation
	
✓	Value professional development
	
✓	Want creative challenges
	
✓	Want to work faster and better
	
✓	Prefer flexibility in their work and work schedules
	
✓	Desire telecommuting
	
✓	Want to work part-time to have more personal or family time
	
✓	Tend to be optimistic

228
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
	
✓	Exude confidence
	
✓	Are civic-minded
	
✓	Are innovative
	
Don’t underestimate the abilities of ’Net Generation workers. As Malcolm 
Gladwell points out in his book Outliers, experts become experts through 
opportunity and hours of practice. It takes about 10,000 hours of practice for 
someone like Michael Jordan to perfect his skills. These employees from 
Generation Y have put in at least 20,000 hours using digital technology since 
birth. This is the only generation to have practiced this long.
Understanding the Digital Brain
Research shows that technology changes the way the brain works. Some of 
those changes are beneficial. Other changes separate us more from the dif­
ferent generations and affecting the way people work. The upcoming sections 
look at the effects of technology on the brain.
Considering technology’s effect on brains
Neuroscientists tell us that the brain is a “use it or lose it” organ. Using technol­
ogy brings about new connections, new cells, and new learning. Other parts of 
the brain that are not used or are no longer used begin to wither away.
The good news is that current technology brings about the following advan­
tages. People who use it
	
✓	Skim material more effectively
	
✓	Are more efficient
	
✓	May have better problem-solving skills
	
✓	Get information faster
	
✓	Communicate globally
	
✓	Respond to visual stimuli quickly

229
 Chapter 15: Overcoming the Digital Divide
The bad news is that technologically savvy workers also may
	
✓	Have more attention problems
	
✓	Have shorter attention spans
	
✓	Experience more addictions
	
✓	Lose people skills
	
✓	Never develop good listening skills
	
✓	Have difficulty reading body language
Debunking the multitasking myth
The brain cannot give full attention to more than one thing at a time. 
Research suggests strongly that something, or all things, that you try to do 
simultaneously are cheated. Multitasking is not the wonderful skill it was 
once thought to be.
The female brain often gets accolades for its ability to do multiple tasks at one 
time. As I tell you in Chapter 12, that ability is a myth. You can’t think about 
two things at one time and give them both direct attention. You probably 
have been in situations in which you were talking to a small group of people 
at a party and became interested in the conversation of a nearby group. You 
tried to follow the other conversation. In the meantime your group continued 
to chat, and someone asked you for a response. You didn’t have a clue what 
you were supposed to say. It’s a common problem, and it shows how the 
brain has difficulty switching from one cognitive area to another.
The brain has to go through several steps to switch attention. They happen 
in milliseconds, but for every exchange, the following five steps take place:
	
1.	The reticular activating system, which regulates what information 
enters your brain examines the new information.
	
2.	The parietal lobe disengages from its current focus.
	
3.	The cingulate gyrus shifts focus to new information.
	
4.	The prefrontal cortex considers the choices and picks one.
	
5.	The prefrontal cortex inhibits the other possible choices in order to 
focus and hold new information in working memory.

Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
The person at work who looks busiest may actually be the least productive. 
Attempting to move from task to task too quickly has been known to slow 
people down by 50 percent and add 50 percent more mistakes!
Do you see this person in your organization? As you walk by his office or cubi­
cle, this multitasker is working at his computer with the phone on speaker so 
he can carry on a conversation with a client as he finishes a report that’s due 
by the end of the day. His cell phone plays a special tune indicating he has 
just received a text message. Keeping one hand on the keyboard, he reaches 
for his Blackberry and begins reading the message. Seen enough? Wait a 
minute — another window on his computer opens up as he receives the famil­
iar sound for incoming e-mail. He puts the Blackberry down after sending a 
brief reply to the text sender and double clicks on the mail he just received. 
It’s his wife reminding him that he has a dental appointment immediately after 
work. He responds with a smiley face and switches back to his speakerphone 
conversation as the client has just asked him a question. He has no idea how 
he is to respond to “What do you think?” He asks the client to go over it again 
for him. You can hear the voice on the speaker becoming impatient. Is it any 
wonder that mistakes are being made? 
Addressing Digital Differences
The brains of those who are digitally connected are different from those who 
are not. The upcoming sections offer suggestions for helping these different 
kinds of brains work together, communicate effectively, and be productive in 
their own individual ways.
The digital native
Today’s world requires a new language and a new literacy — digital lit­
eracy. The late Generation X-ers and the generations that follow them are 
digital natives — they speak the language well. These people have grown up 
with video games, cell phones, computers, mp3 players, the Internet, and 
other techno toys. The ABCs of learning have been replaced with the XYZs 
of technology.
Learning and working for these generations has been a matter of action and 
interaction. Unlike the Boomers, and very unlike the Traditionalists, these 
digital natives grew up communicating in a very different and fast-paced way. 

231
 Chapter 15: Overcoming the Digital Divide
They’re proud of their ability to come up with hard data quickly and easily. 
The working and learning gap between these generations and the prior 
groups is wide.
The digital natives who believe that their world isn’t complete if they aren’t 
constantly connected are always trying to multitask. They’re working their 
hardest to switch from one task to another and then back again without 
skipping a beat. But doing so is difficult. Former Microsoft executive Linda 
Stone calls this problem continuous partial attention. Not truly giving anything 
complete attention has a number of negative effects, including inability to 
accomplish a darned thing. Efforts to stay connected may prohibit you from 
bringing deep thought and closure to any one project. A common result of 
this situation is stress. And stress is the enemy of getting the job done well.
The digital immigrant
Some Traditionalists, most Baby Boomers, and the early Gen X-ers fall into 
the category of digital immigrants — they didn’t grow up learning this second 
language and speak it with varying degrees of fluency.
The following characteristics describe many of the digital immigrants:
	
✓	Insists on paper bills even though he receives copies via e-mail
	
✓	Prints out e-mails and attachments and relies on printed newspapers, 
books, and so on
	
✓	Is leery of paying bills online
	
✓	Believes that methods she was taught years ago should work for everyone
	
✓	Is outraged by the informal text used in e-mails and instant messages
	
✓	Believes “real math” is done without a calculator, let alone a computer
	
✓	Believes a social network consists of people he meets with for bridge or 
outings
Digital immigrants have much to offer to the workforce — wisdom derived 
from years of storing patterns in the brain gives them the ability to see the 
big picture, predict accurately, foresee future consequences, and draw on 
mental templates to help store impressive amounts of new information. 
Challenging tasks activate more areas in the frontal lobes of the brains of 
Boomers and Traditionalists than in the brains of younger subjects.

232
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
The immigrants have little choice because their brains change as they 
increase their skills with technology. The late Gen X-ers and the Gen Y-ers 
may need to practice more conventional skills that their brains haven’t used 
very much, like building rapport face to face.
The digital dinosaur
Natives speak the language of their birth, immigrants are learning to translate 
the digital language of the natives, and then there are what I call the digital 
dinosaurs — those individuals or businesses that are hopelessly out of date. 
You may think that Traditionalists fall into this category, and some do. But 
anyone or any business can be a dinosaur.
Digital media is transforming organizations everywhere. If your business 
appears to be incapable of change, those who embrace digital technology 
won’t find it appealing. If your customers are changing their minds and get­
ting plugged into the latest in technology, you don’t want to present yourself 
as stuck in an analog world.
Take a close look at what your competitors are doing digitally. If they’re still 
dinosaurs, make some changes so your business can be the first to enter the 
global age. Rather than feeling safe because they aren’t doing anything that 
you’re not doing, get out of that reptile brain and use your thinking brain to 
take some risks to get updated.
Communicating Brain to Brain 
and Face to Face
As a leader working among several generations, your challenge is to find a 
way to keep the loyal Traditionalists, the hard-working Boomers, the wander­
ing X-ers and the totally connected Y-ers working together in harmony so 
your business can flourish.
Table 15-1 provides you some basic comparisons of the generations and their 
responses to work.

Working together digitally: Plugging in
Harnessing the gifts of both digital natives and digital immigrants is your 
job as leader. Honoring each group’s strengths and finding ways for them to 
work together successfully can be a challenge.
The two generations that are already plugged in have different needs. 
Generation Y may be high maintenance, but they’re also high performing. 
They need attention, supervision, direction, and feedback. Generation X 
wants little supervision, but they do want feedback. The generations that 
are trying to plug in feel a little behind. They want their meetings in real life, 
don’t need e-mail memos, want supervision and feedback. They stick with 
you through thick and thin, so playing the loyalty card works with them. 
(With the younger generations, not so much.) Negotiating time off with family 
may be more motivating for younger generations.
Here are some issues facing leaders who work with multiple generations:
	
✓	X-ers want a more relaxed atmosphere.
	
✓	Y-ers need structure.
	
✓	Boomers are still learning.
	
✓	Traditionalists aren’t sure they want to learn.
And here are some commonalities among the generations:
	
✓	They all like a challenge.
	
✓	They all need feedback.
	
✓	They all value personal or professional growth.
Use the points the generations have in common to begin creating a work 
atmosphere in which your employees thrive together. Each generation has 
something to offer your organization; capitalize on it before you lose them. 
Try some of the following tactics for narrowing the digital divide:
	
✓	Decide on the how, when, and where of feedback: Before any project 
begins, discuss with the team or individuals how and how often they would 
like to receive feedback. Where to receive feedback includes face-to-face 
meetings, e-mails, text messages, memos, faxes, and the list goes on.
	
	For example, if the team working on the projects has a Gen X-er who 
wants feedback via text messages every day, but the Boomer on the 
team prefers e-mails once a week, and the Traditionalist wants a face-
to-face at the end of the project, plan ways to meet the needs of each. 
Compromise by varying the feedback between text and e-mail for the 
X-er, duplicate the e-mail for the Boomer, and plan an end-of-project 
meeting time for all.

235
 Chapter 15: Overcoming the Digital Divide
	
✓	Offer intergenerational training: Because professional growth is of 
interest to most generations, training them together provides an oppor­
tunity for them to get to know each other. Traditionalists can listen and 
learn from the younger generations about how to access information 
quickly. The X-ers and Y-ers can learn from the older generations about 
their years of work experience. Let trainees choose the way they want to 
learn, or have the training set up in a fashion so each generation gets a 
taste of what the other generations learning styles are.
	
✓	Talk about generational differences: Offer the opportunity to share 
points of view. If conflict arises, let the generations talk it out. Be a role 
model for accepting generational differences. Let your employees see 
that you value contributions from each generation.
	
✓	Mentor and coach: The social brain needs interaction and nurturing. 
Providing mentors or coaches who take an interest and provide feed­
back from another perspective. Create mentor/mentee combinations 
with different generations to help bridge the gap.
	
✓	Offer challenging work: All generations prefer work that challenges and 
interests them. Link challenges to their personal roles in reaching the 
company’s vision.
Let each employee work from her strengths, whatever those may be. 
Those who are comfortable with teleconferencing or using Skype should 
be encouraged and enabled to do so. Your customer/client base provides 
the information you need to devise a plan. For instance, your Boomer client 
wants a face-to-face meeting; your X or Y customer prefers a phone or video 
conference.
If your business caters to the digital natives, your contact with them and 
your marketing techniques need to be technologically advanced. If you deal 
with Boomers or Traditionalists for the most part, then you need your work­
force to cater to their needs. As you look to the future determine who will 
be taking on leadership responsibilities in your organization and who your 
clientele will be. Increase the technology as you look to the future of your 
business.
Working face to face
Because those workers in Generations X and Y grew up in a digital world, 
they never relied on face-to-face meetings with people. They did almost 
everything by using digital toys. And it worked well for them with their peers.
However, while they were wiring their brains for technology, some of them 
began to lose their social skills. You can’t learn to read faces and body lan­
guage if you don’t see faces and bodies!

236
Part III: Working with the Brains You Have 
Some of your professional development dollars must go to training or 
retraining these employees in real-life interactive skills. Here are some tips 
for doing so:
	
✓	Once in a while, ask employees to disconnect. Plan some interactive 
events in which employees mingle without interruptions.
	
✓	Schedule face-to-face meetings.
	
✓	Place them on teams with projects that encourage group participation 
and interaction.
	
✓	Ask tech natives to teach immigrants in a friendly, positive manner; have 
the immigrants teach the natives about building rapport and relation­
ships in real time with real people.
	
✓	Give them reflection time or have them trained in some mindfulness 
techniques. These are like meditation strategies that take them away 
from the digital world and let them examine what is going on inside their 
own heads.
Attracting the best of both worlds
You want to attract the best brains for your business, whether they’re digital 
natives or digital immigrants. Appealing to both sides of the digital coin is 
easier when you
	
✓	Make sure your Web site is informative, user-friendly, and has links to 
employment opportunities: Most generations actively looking for work 
know to look online or have someone do it for them. Digital natives must 
be able to see a clear overview of your company online. 
	
✓	Offer flexible schedules: Some Baby Boomers and Traditionalists are 
coming back to the workforce because they can’t afford to retire. They 
may be as interested as Gen X and Gen Y in part-time work or flexible 
schedules. 
	
✓	Make retirement plans available: All generations would like a retire­
ment savings plan. 
	
✓	Update your perks: The younger generations may like perks such as 
daycare facilities. All generations would benefit from wellness programs 
and workout facilities.

W
ouldn’t it be nice if you could hire people who were already trained 
to perform the exact skills you need for your company? Rarely do 
you run into that kind of synergy. You have specific needs, and although you 
may hire people who have great credentials and experience in the field, you 
most likely need to train them to function at their best within your organiza­
tion. Whether you’re just planning a business or have been in a leadership 
position for some time, training should be at the top of your list of important 
expenses. In fact, scratch that word expense when you think about training. 
Training is an investment in the future of your company.
Some companies believe that training their staff and encouraging career 
growth is what makes them successful. Unfortunately, other leaders believe 
that on-the-job training and challenging projects create enough growth, or 
that training is a waste of money because employees will take that knowledge 
to other companies. In this chapter, you find out about the importance of 
training and the consequences of avoiding.

240
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Avoiding the Knowledge Curse: 
You Don’t Have All the Answers
A true leader recognizes the limits of his own knowledge and skills. Getting a 
company up and running and keeping it on track takes many kinds of talent. 
The knowledge curse is that phenomena wherein the leader either thinks 
he has all of the answers, or the employees believe he does. A true leader 
doesn’t have to know how to program a computer to get the information he 
needs; he has to have the knowledge to hire a person with the proper skills 
and training.
Recognizing employees’ capabilities
Authoritarian leaders don’t believe that their employees are capable. They 
often tell them exactly what to do and how to do it. People tend to look at 
leaders of this type as know-it-alls. As you might guess, know-it-alls are not 
very popular with employees. They make them feel inadequate and can even 
cause real harm.
Know-it-alls create people who are helpless. Learned helplessness is a condi­
tion in which a person feels that her life is out of her control and that she’s 
powerless to change it. No matter what this person does, in her mind, she 
cannot make a difference. She thinks, “Since I can’t do anything right, why 
bother even trying?” 
	
The term learned helplessness was coined by the psychologist Martin 
Seligman. He discovered the concept when working with dogs. Seligman found 
that a dog placed in a cage with a metal bottom would, when an electric 
charge was turned on, dance around looking for a place in the cage where 
there was no charge. When the charge was turned off, the dog would return to 
whatever he was doing. When the charge came again, the dog danced around 
again. Eventually, however, the dog gave up and would lay down and take the 
electrical shock. The dog figured it could not do anything to save himself. 
When the experimenters shocked only half the cage and tried to get the dog to 
the unshocked side, they had to drag the dog over repeatedly. They would 
drag him to the safe side, but because the dog had been trained to feel out of 
control, he returned to the shocked side.
When leaders don’t give employees the opportunity to feel competent 
through training or by assigning projects and giving them agency over those 
projects, employees lose their motivation, inspiration, and drive.

241
 Chapter 16: No Train, No Gain: Understanding the Value of Training
Giving employees skills to perform
If you want your employees to take risks and to show initiative, you have to 
provide the opportunity for them to master their jobs through the appro­
priate training. A leader who makes all of the decisions instead of training 
employees to handle some of them loses out on the basic knowledge her 
employees have brought to the organization. Plus, if you allow yourself to be 
the last word on everything, you find yourself in a stressful situation.
The be-all-end-all leader who doesn’t want to train employees isn’t neces­
sarily authoritarian. Instead, he truly believes that training isn’t necessary. 
Perhaps he worked her way up in the business by watching others and on-
the-job training. Or maybe he has so much information in his head that he 
doesn’t understand why others don’t just know what to do.
Many employers are just afraid of pulling people off the job for training. 
They’re afraid of low productivity for those few days. They may be over­
whelmed with the responsibility of being everyone’s answer person. Yet fear 
keeps them from training, fear that they’re setting a precedent and everyone 
is going to want to take time off and be trained, and this leader ends up with 
more fear as he discovers that the business cannot run well with only one 
person capable of making decisions and taking risks.
When I tell employers that they don’t have time to be the “be-all-end-all” at 
their company, they don’t believe that being interrupted and asked questions 
is really a problem. I think that being needed makes them feel good. 
The CEO of a department store is the be-all-end-all for his business. Business 
was going well, and so he decided to expand and add some new locations. His 
untrained employees became managers of the new locations and proceeded 
to try to train new employees. The lack of training of his original employees 
produced a wide variety of outcomes. He was hit with questions constantly. 
His original, untrained employees still couldn’t make decisions on their own; 
they either didn’t know the answers or lacked the confidence to act on their 
own. The less than stellar job the original employees did when training new 
ones left the new people unprepared for their jobs. Instead of seeing what 
was happening and doing something about it, the owner began complaining 
about the new managers and new employees. The real problem was his need 
to feel important and his fear of training his staff.
Does this sound like the kind of person you would want to work for or have 
working for you? Because he’s a charming man who makes people laugh, 
they put up with his shenanigans. I feel sorry for him and for his people. He 
needs to be the final answer in his business to make himself feel important. 

242
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Problems were easy to take care of when he had one location because he was 
always physically present to address any issues. Since he expanded, he works 
himself ragged trying to make it to each of his stores several times a week. He 
has customers make appointments only with him so that he can personally 
take care of big sales. He feeds his ego. And his company will fail if he doesn’t 
change his tactics. His health and marriage will probably suffer, too.
Training Employees for Self-Sufficiency
Ask an employer what’s in it for them to pull people off the job and send 
them to trainings and you probably hear “increased revenue” and “increased 
productivity for the long-term.” In order to make training result in major ben­
efits for a business, including self-sufficiency for your employees, you must 
consider the following:
	
✓	Look at the big picture to determine your priorities.
	
✓	Examine internal processes to identify those that could be done more 
efficiently.
	
✓	Determine where mistakes are being made.
	
✓	Prioritize your training needs.
	
✓	Find the right training company or trainer. (Chapter 18 gives suggestions.)
	
✓	Prepare to have employees off the job. (Chapter 18 tells you how to plan 
for the time off.) You need to
 
• Make training a commitment by the entire company.
 
• Let managers know they may be filling in for employees.
 
• Give employees motivation for doing more work while others are 
being trained.
A self-sufficient workforce feels better about itself. Your employees feel 
valued because you invest in them, and they are more self-confident. In the 
short term, profits or production may be affected in a minor way, but in the 
long-term, the organization is likely to be more profitable and productive 
with trained workers.
Gaining through office training
Many employees learn only what they need to know to get the job done. 
Creating a document, utilizing a spreadsheet, and sending e-mails might be 
the limit for some office workers. Technology can be intimidating, and these 
people need to be trained to a point of comfort.

243
 Chapter 16: No Train, No Gain: Understanding the Value of Training
Knowledge is power, and those working in the knowledge industry need to 
concentrate on what they can do with that power rather than focusing their 
attention on how a program works. The brain’s working memory, which 
enables you to hold incoming information is limited. If working memory is 
focusing on which button to push or how to use the mouse, the real power 
is then in the hands of the tool instead of in the mind of the user. Train office 
people to mastery. Then let them use their creative minds and their problem-
solving ability to take your company to greater levels.
And don’t stop with just trainings. Professional organizations in your field 
hold meetings and conferences. Attending these meetings can be motivat­
ing as well as educational. Give your employees the opportunity to feel like 
professionals by attending. They may learn cutting-edge approaches to your 
industry that save more time and increase production.
Offering tech training
One of the biggest mistakes companies make is in adding new processes or 
technology to their operations but not training the people who use them. And 
those older processes or technologies may not be the problem in the first 
place. Employees may not be utilizing them well because they were never 
trained to do so.
Learning to speak a foreign language
Jose Menchaca applied for his job at the meat-
packing plant knowing little English but a lot 
about meat. His interview consisted of show­
ing Manager Lucas Andrews how he handled 
the beef. Meat packing is one of the most dan­
gerous jobs there is, yet Jose handled himself 
with such ease that Lucas knew he was hiring 
a good employee.
After Jose had worked at the plant for several 
months, Lucas decided that his style of cutting 
should be taught to the other workers. Lucas 
asked Jose if he would be willing to train others. 
Jose didn’t quite understand what Lucas was 
saying, and Lucas realized that perhaps some 
of the problems at the plant between employ­
ees and managers was a language barrier. 
Never before had Lucas considered training his 
employees in anything but their specific jobs, 
but this time he decided that if everyone spoke 
the same language, life might be better at the 
plant.
Lucas planned trainings to teach the workers 
English. Those sessions made a huge differ­
ence in Jose’s life and in the lives of many of 
the workers. Lucas lost some workers after 
spending money on them to learn English, but 
those who stayed were grateful and able to 
communicate their needs much better. Jose 
became the head trainer in cutting meat, got a 
pay raise, and eventually learned to teach more 
than just cutting. He taught many of the newly 
hired Hispanics how to speak English.

244
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
Instead of tossing out the old way of doing things because you think it isn’t 
providing the functionality that you need, take a look at your employees. A 
program, for example, is only as good as the people running it. Make them 
masters in their area of expertise and then let them decide whether the pro­
gram is what they need. Before you spend tens of thousands of dollars on 
upgrades, spend it on those people you entrust your business to.
When the training culminates in employees feeling very knowledgeable about 
their jobs, their approach to programs and processes includes the ability 
to make judgment calls. They will be able to tell you what the needs of their 
departments are. And they will feel more responsible for your goals and your 
vision. When they speak to others, they will speak with confidence and with 
respect for their employer.
Finding Alignment among 
Employees and You
The brain learns patterns and creates a schema — an organized unit of infor­
mation stored in your brain that can be about anything. (I talk in detail about 
patterns and schema in Chapter 3.) You have a schema for your business, 
your job, and your employees. Everyone with whom you do business has a 
schema about your business, as well. Getting your schemas to match is part 
of what good training can do.
Your theories, expectations, behaviors, likes, and dislikes are based on the 
schema you have stored in your brain. These deeply engrained networks 
prevent you from seeing the world in the same way that others see the world. 
In one way, this individualization of perception is a very good thing. If you 
and your employees had exactly the same perception, then you may always 
agree, but not much would change. However, you sometimes want employees 
to see the world the way you do, and reaching consensus isn’t always easy.
You expect your administrative assistant to receive all of your visitors, 
whether they have appointments or not. He’s in charge of maintaining your 
schedule, when possible, and seeing that your guests are comfortable while 
they wait. But if your administrative assistant decides that those without 
appointments are merely wasting your time and asks them to make an 
appointment and leave, he definitely does not have the same mental map 
that you do.

245
 Chapter 16: No Train, No Gain: Understanding the Value of Training
You have two people representing your company at local malls during a 
weekend home show. One believes that the customer is always right. She 
speaks to every customer with respect and answers every question on the 
spot, unless she doesn’t know the answer. In that case she either picks up 
her cell phone to get the answer or takes the customer’s number to give her 
a call back. The other representative feels that people are asking too many 
questions. When he can’t answer a question, he changes the subject and 
talks about what he knows. If they insist on an answer, he makes something 
up or tells them to come to the sales office. Both of these people feel they are 
helping your company, one by taking care of people’s concerns and the other 
by saving you time and money dealing with stupid questions. Whose mental 
map matches yours?
	
If you want to change someone’s schema, you must train him. For example, 
the rep above — who doesn’t have the emotional skills to deal with people 
and questions nor the knowledge to answer those questions — needs training. 
I would first train him to give him the knowledge to answer the questions. 
Having the content stored in his brain may free up his mind and make him self-
confident enough to handle customers in a better manner. If just the content 
knowledge training isn’t enough, he may need emotional intelligence training 
as well.
In Chapter 18, I describe how trainings can change the brain. In Chapter 19, I 
tell you about emotional trainings and how powerful those can be to change 
old habits and instill new ones.
Saving your assets: Recognizing 
a call for training
Your employees are your assets — at least, they should be. How do you know 
when it’s time to train them? Your direct reports and team leaders should 
have some answers for you, but you may find that each department needs 
training, and you can’t afford to do it all at once. Here are a few examples of 
situations that demand training:
	
✓	Your business has changed. For example, you’ve installed a new com­
puter program and the employees have yet to be trained. Or you’re deal­
ing with turbulent economic times. Outdated mental maps are becoming 
useless. Your employees need specific training to recreate mental maps.
	
✓	You talk to your customers, managers, and employees by providing 
feedback surveys and discover some inefficiencies. If your customers 
are complaining, you know it’s time for some changes.

246
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
✓	You check out the complaint department. Are there more complaints 
about one area of business than another? There are those great months 
when you find no complaints, but when cusotmers start complaining 
about one area, like customer service, it’s time to pay attention.
	
✓	You check the status of errors. Are there a lot of dented items? 
Irregulars? Whatever you’re producing or whatever service you’re pro­
viding, human errors based on a lack of knowledge tell you that you 
need to change their current schema and train them to create flawless 
processes and procedures. If the necessary changes aren’t clear, get 
feedback from the employees through meetings.
	
✓	Check on employee turnover. Have you lost a lot of experienced people 
recently? First, you want to know why people are leaving. Some personal 
meetings may be necessary to discover the reasons. Do they feel they 
aren’t up to the challenge? They may lack the training they need to feel 
productive and valued.
	
✓	Check the bottom line. Does your data indicate that the number of new 
customers is down? Are you making less money than you did last year? 
Try to isolate the areas, either within the company or geographically, to 
find the problem. Reevaluate the training you are currently providing. 
Does it address the problems you’ve found?
Using the information you have now gathered, meet with your senior leader­
ship team. Together come up with a plan. Prioritize those training needs. 
Set up a schedule for trainings in every department that needs it. Determine 
whether the training will be held offsite, which is highly recommended, and 
who is going to do the training.
Creating change without pain
Most changes require training. If you want gains and are making changes, you 
have to keep your main assets — your employees — feeling like they’re part 
of the change. And to maintain them as assets, their thoughts and behaviors 
need to change, too. 
Change can be painful, and the less pain it causes, the happier you and 
your employees are. Allowing employees the opportunity to initiate change 
or define their own roles in the change makes change and training more 
acceptable.
The following steps provide opportunities for workers to take part in the 
changes:

247
 Chapter 16: No Train, No Gain: Understanding the Value of Training
	
1.	Share your new vision or goals, which now include the changes that 
require training.
	
2.	Repeat that vision at all meetings for several weeks to make the new 
schema real.
	
3.	Reiterate that vision at meetings with employees before you discuss 
their participation in fulfilling the vision.
	
	 Let employees ask questions about how the vision could be fulfilled or 
offer suggestions for their own participation.
	
4.	Ask employees for their suggestions on fulfilling the vision.
	
5.	When they see how they fit into the vision, ask them what they would 
need to accomplish the work that keeps them in that vision.
	
6.	Determine what content training is necessary based on their needs.
	
	 The training becomes their idea, and so they accept it more readily.
	
7.	Offer the appropriate training, and follow up with coaching.
	
	 Chapter 4 tells you more about mentoring and coaching.
Expecting the best
You get what you expect. That sounds easier than it is. But if you keep your 
expectations high for your training and your trainees, you are apt to get what 
you need. 
Expectations shape perception and reality. In Chapter 4, I tell you about stud­
ies in which teachers treated less than average students as gifted; the stu­
dents rose to teachers’ high expectations and did very well. 
The placebo effect is another example of expectations affecting reality. Some 
patients who take placebos (usually sugar pills) for pain or infection actually 
get better because they believe that they will. (In an episode of the television 
series MASH, doctors ran out of painkillers and so administered sugar pills. 
They explained to the patients that they were giving them very powerful pain 
killers and could give only small amounts. Many of the patients said their 
pain was gone.)
	
If all trainees enter a training expecting to learn something worthwhile that 
can help with their job, then they will. If you present the training as relevant to 
the success of the company and the value of the employee, trainees see it that 
way, too. 

248
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Keeping a Positive Focus 
When Bringing Change
Training someone to use a computer properly is different from training to 
change someone’s behavior. The former is relatively easy: Trainees learn 
the process and practice a lot. Then they get opportunities to apply their 
learning and perhaps problem-solve if something isn’t working correctly. The 
latter training, to change behavior, must come from within the person. In 
other words, they must gain insight into their own thought processes. That 
kind of change always begins with the positive.
If your organization is changing dramatically, and each employee must 
change her behavior, talking about the wrong behavior isn’t helpful. Imagine 
two sales representatives who show a new product at a home show. One 
answers people’s questions or takes their numbers to get back to them and 
so has 20 potential customers come in or call the company. The other repre­
sentative doesn’t take as much time with potential customers and draws no 
response. What should you say to the second representative to help provide 
insight into what might be more beneficial interactions? Try the following:
You: “What do you think you could do to get more potential customers 
from working at the home show?”
Rep: “Is there a quota I need to fill?”
You: “Let’s take another look at the goals for the customer representative 
department and see.”
Rep: “Our goals include increasing new customers by 10 percent and 
when we wrote that goal, we talked about the home shows bringing in 
new customers. I see that I can make some changes that would encour­
age more people to try our product. I could take the names and numbers 
of anyone who stops by the booth and asks questions. Then I could give 
them a follow-up call.”
You: “That’s a good idea. You might share some of those contacts with the 
salespeople who are used to answering more of the technical questions.”
Rep: “There are some questions I have trouble with. I’ll see if I can talk to 
the technicians, too, and see whether they can answer my questions.”
During this conversation, you enable your employee to form connections in 
his brain that help him become a better public relations representative for 
your company. Your next step is to find the training that all of your employees 
need as you change your goals.

249
 Chapter 16: No Train, No Gain: Understanding the Value of Training
What would have happened if the conversation had begun on a negative 
note? Take a look:
You: “Tanya had twenty potential customers call or come in about our 
product. You didn’t have any.”
Rep: “Well, Tanya was at a better mall. There weren’t many people at 
my mall.”
You: “So, no one stopped by at the home show?”
Rep: “Well, I didn’t feel very well, so I had to leave to go get some aspirin.”
You: “How long were you gone?”
Rep: “Oh, just a few minutes, but that’s when the big rush was.”
You can see that this conversation led the representative to make up 
excuses. That is not going to get him to change his way of thinking.
	
Try to find ways to begin a brain-changing situation by asking the employee 
come up with solutions. Here are some suggestions:
	
✓	If the employee doesn’t see the problem, begin by telling him what you 
see (the results, not the problem). Let the employee identify the prob­
lem. Then ask the employee for solutions.
	
✓	Ask questions on an emotional level. For example, “How do you feel 
about your productivity?” If the answer is “great” refer her to the goals 
of her department or team. Give her time to get the connection. Then 
you ask for solutions.
	
✓	If the employee recognizes the problem, but comes to your for a solu­
tion, ask him to come up with various solutions. Then let him choose 
which one is best. Support his choice if you can and have him try it.
Employees are much more likely to change their current schema with self-
generated ideas. The more often you give them the opportunity to identify a 
need for change and implement their own solution, the more their problem-
solving schema changes as well.
Savoring the aha! moment
You can see the look on someone’s face when 
they have one of those aha! moments. There’s 
nothing like that moment when a new idea 
clicks into place to make the brain release 
the chemicals that make you feel good. Those 
include dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin. If 
you have this moment of clarity with others, like 
your teammates, your brain releases oxytocin, 
which helps you bond with those people.

O
ne of my favorite trainings involved a passionate presenter, a lot of 
movement, interaction with others, and music in the background. If 
you ask me what information I remember from this training, I would have 
to say “very little.” The presenter kept me awake — most of the time. But I 
was so sleep-deprived from a project I had to get done for work that staying 
awake was very difficult. My stress levels were also very high because of the 
deadline. I didn’t understand why my employer had insisted I go to this train­
ing when I had so much to do. I left the training every day at 5 or 6 o’clock. I 
then drove through a fast-food restaurant, grabbed a burger or a salad, and 
headed back to the office to work. At midnight or 1 a.m. I drove drive home 
and finally got to sleep about 2 a.m. The alarm went off at 7, giving me just 
enough time to shower and dress. Breakfast just didn’t exist for me unless I 
ate a donut at the training.
What I remember about that training were the stressful events that sur­
rounded it, not the content. Taking part was really a waste of my time, the 
company’s time, and the extra time I spent on the job teaching myself what I 
had missed at the training.
Good nutrition, healthy sleep patterns, lowered stress, and proper hydration 
contribute to a healthy body and an open mind. The difference between a 
worthwhile training and a worthless training is not only the trainer, but the 
state of mind and body of the trainees.

252
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
If your workers are fit to be trained and not fit to be tied, then they should be 
looking forward to the training. The more positive you are about the training, 
the more positive your employees are. Remember, emotions are contagious. 
You can make a big impact on their attitude sand emotional states.
In this chapter, you find out about proper nutrition and how it affects the 
brain before, during, and after a training. I also tell you about hydration and 
dealing with sleep deprivation so that you get the most out of any training 
you offer. And I show you how the level of challenge correlates to the effec­
tiveness of the training.
Providing Food for Thought
Trainings require work, and work requires sustenance. Provide your trainees 
with appropriate nutrition to keep their brains and bodies working at their 
optimal level. The upcoming sections explain how various kinds of “fuel” 
affect those brains and bodies.
Eating for the brain
If only you had listened to your grandmother’s words of wisdom and eaten 
your veggies, you’d be a happier, healthier, and smarter person! She didn’t 
know the science behind it, but she knew what she saw: People behave 
better, listen more carefully, and think more clearly when they eat well.
In Chapter 2, you find out about neurotransmitters, chemicals in the brain that 
influence behaviors, thoughts, and feelings. The foods you eat encourage the 
production of these chemicals. Table 17-1 gives you details about how food 
affects neurotransmitter production.
	
You are what you eat, and you think what you eat. The brain needs the right 
foods to most effectively produce neurotransmitters.
Your brain runs on glucose, which is a sugar formed from the good foods you 
eat. Your blood supply carries glucose to your brain, which uses this food for 
energy. Eating the right foods helps your brain remain healthy.
	
The old food pyramid has been replaced by several newer, healthier versions. 
You can find up-to-date pyramids from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (www.
mypyramid.gov/pyramid/index.html), Mayo Clinic (www.mayoclinic.

Here are some of the ways that what you eat affects your brain:
	
✓	Proteins: Proteins form the amino acids that your brain needs to help 
you feel calm, animated, and positive. Eating protein in the morning 
helps you remain more alert. Proteins are raw materials for producing 
neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine.
	
✓	Fats: There are good fats and bad fats. Bad fats are saturated fats and 
transfats. Good fats include monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated 
fats. Essential to brain health, Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated. 
They help give the axons the myelin coating they need to aid in smooth 
and fast transmission of information. Fish oil capsules have become 
popular in the health industry to aid in memory, lowering cholesterol, 
and improving heart function. Depression, poor memory, learning dis­
abilities, and inattention can result from low amounts of Omega-3s.
	
✓	Sugar: Along with red meats and refined grains, sugar should be used 
sparingly. Some studies show that brain activity increases after you eat 
sugary foods. But the effect is short-lived, and sugar causes a multitude 
of problems including a blood sugar drop that makes you sleepy.

✓	Whole grains: An important part of your diet, these complex carbohy­
drates go in to making the glucose for your brain.
	
✓	Fruits and vegetables: These foods provide the body with natural 
sugars, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. The Center for Disease Control 
has a Web site with a calculator to determine how many servings you 
need: www.fruitsandveggiesmatter.gov/.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Your brain is the only organ 
in your body that does not store energy. When you awaken, your brain is run­
ning on fumes.
	
Many adults who skip breakfast exhibit a negative attitude toward their work 
and colleagues, lack of attention, and a decline in performance.
What are the possible consequences of all of your employees eating accord­
ing to their brains’ needs?
	
✓	Positive attitudes
	
✓	Happiness
	
✓	Sense of humor
	
✓	Productivity
	
✓	Friendliness
	
✓	Creativity
	
✓	Problem solving
	
✓	Peak performance
	
Good nutrition increases the production of new brain cells. New brain cells 
improve the brain’s learning and memory capabilities. What prevents the pro­
cess? Poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and stress.
Maintaining the training
Eat little. Eat often. Eat brain food. That’s the best plan for feeding your 
employees and clients at a training. Sounds simple? It is. Your goal is to get 
your people trained and help them remember the training. Feeding them 
properly makes a difference. Here is a sample menu that gives employees’ 
brains what they need:
	
✓	Breakfast: Whole-grain bagels and breads, whole-grain cereal; fruit, nuts, 
dried fruit, low-fat milk, 100-percent juices, eggs, turkey, lean meat, fruit 
smoothies, yogurt

255
 Chapter 17: Ensuring that Employees Are Fit to Be Trained
	
✓	Post-breakfast snack: Fruits and vegetables
	
✓	Lunch: Green salads topped with eggs, cheese, turkey, carrots, broc­
coli, or cauliflower; whole-grain rolls with real butter; tea, low-fat milk, 
100-percent fruit juice
	
✓	Post-lunch snack: Fruits, vegetables, cheese and whole-grain crackers
	
✓	Dinner: Salmon, asparagus, tossed salad, whole-grain rolls, butter
	
✓	Post-dinner snack: Fruits, vegetables, smoothies, yogurt
	
✓	Hydration throughout the day: Water, water, water
Although this is just a sample, these foods are very important to keep brains 
alert and to maintain the glucose levels for learning. In addition to the good 
nutrition and food breaks, provide plenty of brain breaks — time to move and 
stretch — especially if the training is a long one.
	
This example shows the training going into the evening, which is sometimes 
unavoidable but never a really good idea for brains. Trainees need down 
time and plenty of sleep so that they can encode information into long-term 
memory. By extending the day and fighting their need for sleep, stress levels 
increase and attention levels decrease.
	
Encourage your trainees to keep their brains hydrated. Do this by keeping 
ample bottles of water or icy pitchers and glasses within easy grasp.
Demonstrating the water-energy connection
One of the strategies I use to demonstrate the 
importance of hydration at my trainings is to use 
an energy ball, which is available at most sci­
ence stores. An energy ball is a small white ball 
that looks similar to a ping pong ball. It has two 
metal strips on one side. When you touch both 
metal strips a light goes on and the ball makes a 
sound. This is a great device for teaching about 
connectivity and circuits. When another person 
joins me, I place one of my fingers on a strip 
and she places one of hers on the other. Then to 
complete the circuit we clasp our other hands 
together. Bingo! The light and sound begin. 
When I ask for a volunteer who has had little to 
drink that morning and we try to make the circuit 
together, it often won’t work or the ball’s light 
is dimmer and the sound lower. The volunteer 
then is asked to drink some water and try again 
a few minutes later. The result is a brighter light 
and louder sound. The importance of keeping 
your system hydrated to increase the electrical 
activity in your brain is proven.

Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Discovering the Importance 
of Catching Zs
Of course you don’t want your trainees sleeping during the training, but sleep 
is going to be a factor in how well they retain what they’re trained. You want 
them to come to the training refreshed and ready. Accomplishing that feat is 
a matter of education (yours and theirs), workload, and time.
As a trainer, one of the first questions I ask of my trainees is, “How many of you 
got eight hours of sleep last night?” Normally less than one-fourth of partici­
pants raise their hands. My next comment is, “So, the rest of you got more?” 
They think this is pretty funny, and they really don’t stop to think about the 
consequences of this lack of sleep. But as their trainer, I know what I am up 
against. When I ask how much sleep participants usually get, I undoubtedly 
hear anywhere from four to six hours — they’ve come to me sleep deprived.
	
Some people may genetically be more resilient to sleep deprivation. In studies, 
such people performed well on cognitive tasks after a sleepless night. They are 
able to recruit more brain areas for these tasks than are those without the same 
predisposition. 
The consequences of sleep deprivation include
	
✓	Memory loss
	
✓	Cognitive impairment
	
✓	Automobile accidents
	
✓	Work injury
	
✓	Illness
One possible solution to the sleep-deprivation problem is naptime. A regular 
nap or meditation time rejuvenates the brain. (Chapter 12 tells you more 
about naps.) Incorporating naps or other down times into your trainings may 
make the difference between your participants “getting it” or not.
Sleep studies show that memory storage takes place during sleep. Although 
this storage is ongoing most of the night, some studies suggest that most 
memory storage takes place during the last two hours of an eight-hour sleep.
If your employees are fit to be trained, they come to the training having slept 
well — preferably having had seven or eight hours’ sleep. As they learn and 
store information in working memory to later be stored in long-term memory, 
they need the necessary sleep the night after the training and each succes­
sive night of the training. A brand-new concept may need three weeks of 

257
 Chapter 17: Ensuring that Employees Are Fit to Be Trained
sleep to make it into long-term memory. That is why the training is never 
really over when it’s over. Sleep and memory work together to make lasting 
connections in the brain.
To sleep, perchance to learn
By the third day of training, the trainer had fallen 
far behind. The reason was simple: He was an 
in-house trainer doing training in house, and so 
every possible interruption, from phone calls to 
client visits, hacked into the time planned for 
training.
The trainer consulted his supervisor, and they 
decided together that the training would have 
to go longer into the evening because only five 
days had been reserved for the training. Every 
salesperson had to know how to use the new 
software system before the first of the month 
when all of the associated companies would 
make the switch. The trainees were made 
aware of the time changes, and another thirty 
minutes was lost as employees made phone 
calls to change plans, notify families, and alert 
customers.
Although the training had been going well and 
everyone seemed to be understanding the new 
system, the extended time became a problem. 
By 8 p.m. that evening when the training ended 
for the day, 20 exhausted employees ran out the 
door. Some had been drinking coffee to stay 
awake after the quick dinner of fried chicken 
had been served. Because training would 
resume a mere 12 hours later, everyone needed 
to get home, go over some homework, and get 
some sleep for the next day.
That didn’t happen. Every single participant 
stayed up until at least midnight doing office 
work, looking over the homework, finishing 
chores around the house, and finally hitting the 
sheets with a maximum of six hours to sleep 
before awakening, dressing, and driving to the 
training by 8 a.m. The employees arrived on 
time. They all walked in with a cup of coffee 
in hand, looking a bit more disheveled than 
usual. When the trainer began, the room got 
very quiet, a sure sign of stress. As the trainer 
started questioning the trainees, there were 
looks of surprise and shame on many of the 
faces. One hand raised.
“Are you sure you talked about this yesterday? I 
can’t find any of this in my notes.” Several others 
nodded in agreement. The trainer had to reteach 
the information from the previous day. More pre­
cious time was lost. She hadn’t had to reteach 
on day 2 or on day 3, but extending the day made 
everyone more tired and anxious. Lack of sleep 
did nothing to lower stress hormone levels, so the 
participants entered on day 4 already stressed 
and sleep deprived. They hadn’t had enough 
sleep to store yesterday’s information. The 
coffee drinking from the night before may have 
kept them from falling asleep during the train­
ing, but it also kept many of them awake deep 
into the night.
Somewhere within this training a day had 
been lost. The circumstances were not brain-
compatible: too much training and too little 
sleep. As a result, employees were far behind 
the rest of the organization in their software 
skills.
Many training rules were broken (Chapter 18 
gives you the lowdown on running effective 
trainings), and participants’ lack of sleep made 
matters worse.

258
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
To encourage a good night’s sleep before a training, limit the projects that 
your employees might work late. Those projects are important, but for the 
training to be successful, sleep is imperative for most people.
Sleep-deprived trainees enter the training with melatonin (the chemical that 
induces sleep) still in their systems. One way to wake them up is to get some 
adrenaline flowing. At the beginning of the day, ask them to participate in 
some movement activities and assign a group activity in which everyone 
must perform. This may be as simple as creating a role play that demon­
strates yesterday afternoon’s topic.
Less Stress, Less Guess
Keeping stress levels low before and during a training produces the most 
favorable outcome. Creating situations in which your employees are in a safe, 
non-threatening environment sets the stage for success. Learning requires 
attention and focus; stress interrupts both. Employees who feel less stress 
retain the information.
The brain learns best when it’s being challenged but doesn’t feel threatened. 
The best trainings engage the emotional areas of the brain. The best leaders 
therefore create trainings that appeal to the emotions. A low-threat, high-
challenge work environment and training environment motivates the brain to 
learn, to act, and to be productive.
Maintaining a low-threat atmosphere
Any threat causes a survival response in the brain, which releases adrenaline 
and stress hormones that cause a cascade of changes:
	
✓	The heart races.
	
✓	Respiration increases.
	
✓	Blood flow goes to your hands or your legs so that you’re ready to fight 
or flee.
	
✓	The release of saliva stops.
	
✓	Digestion stops.
	
✓	The immune system gears up to help heal tissue damage.
	
✓	Ovulation and sperm production are delayed.

259
 Chapter 17: Ensuring that Employees Are Fit to Be Trained
Low threat is the absence of the points above. Someone who isn’t feeling 
threatened feels pretty good. She may be relaxed and curious about what’s 
going to happen. Anticipation may be the emotional state she is in. These are 
positive emotional states for learning.
	
A low-threat atmosphere is an environment in which people feel physically 
and emotionally safe. Mistakes are considered part of the process and no 
questions are considered stupid.
Keeping employees challenged
Novel experiences and novel information alert the brain and keep it focused. 
Just as employees want to be challenged in their work, they want to be chal­
lenged in their trainings.
Assess trainees before training to determine each individual’s understanding 
of the material. To obtain this pre-assessment, you can ask team leaders and 
department heads for observations, or the trainer may have a written pre-
assessment that you can give prior to the training. Pre-assessment enables 
employees to be coached to higher levels of understanding.
Trainees know they’re being challenged if they feel the work is stimulating 
yet doable. The key to getting employees to accept challenge is making cer­
tain they know they have or will have the skills they need to learn and accom­
plish whatever tasks are put before them. 
	
To keep trainees challenged:
	
✓	Provide materials that explain the learning.
	
✓	Provide coaches for each team of trainees to help them stay on track 
and answer difficult questions.
	
✓	Hold trainees responsible for learning: use team challenges such as 
short competitions, role plays, written tests.
Working (and Talking) in Teams
When people work with others to learn new information, stress is usually 
much lower. No one feels as though they are put on the spot. Answers are 
team answers.

260
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Teamwork provides many advantages for trainings, such as
	
✓	Security: Each trainee has someone to lean on and learn with.
	
✓	Sociability: Team members have the opportunity to get to know a fellow 
employee or fellow team member from work in a different way.
	
✓	Knowledge: Team members learn from each other.
	
✓	Creativity: Team members share ideas to reach common goals.
	
✓	Accountability: Team members feel accountable to each other for learn­
ing and completing tasks.
Before, during, and after a training your teams need time to share what they 
know. These meetings can prepare employees for training, and reinforce the 
training afterward.
	
A good trainer provides trainees with time to look at the training manual 
either days before the training or the morning of the first day. By previewing 
the material, the participants feel more comfortable with it. If the trainer intro­
duces one of the concepts, vocabulary words, or part of a product that the 
brain has seen and read previously — even if only a few minutes earlier — it 
feels a bit more confident about the information.
Introducing a low-stress training method
The trainer has a plan to lower stress in her 
trainings. After asking the trainees to form 
groups of three or four, she asks them a ques­
tion about what she has discussed so far. The 
trainer then gives the groups a few minutes to 
discuss what they’ve heard.
While the groups share, the trainer walks 
around and eavesdrops. If she finds a group 
that isn’t getting it, she stops the talking and 
asks each group to join another group to dis­
cuss the same question. In this way, the other 
participants repair the misconceptions.
When the groups finish the discussions and the 
trainer is confident that they know what they’re 
talking about, she asks questions of the whole 
group. Any person who speaks, however, must 
say, “I heard someone say . . .” before providing 
an answer. Starting in groups and then credit­
ing another person with the answer removes 
stress from the speaker and ensures that the 
trainer gets volunteers to answer her questions 
and discuss the content.
If you feel that your employees should be 
able to discuss new learning without any sort 
of “crutch,” keep in mind that many of your 
employees are competitive, and their egos are 
sometimes at stake in a training, especially one 
with completely new information.

261
 Chapter 17: Ensuring that Employees Are Fit to Be Trained
Talking among teams during the training, at appropriate times, helps employees 
reinforce what they are learning. If all team members start off with approxi­
mately the same knowledge base, they can use discussion to help each other 
make connections to what they already know and do at work.
Meeting and discussing the training when the training is over is not only a 
rehearsal method, it is common ground for more communication. One ques­
tion I suggest for these reviews is “How did you feel about the training?” This 
question begins a dialogue on an emotional level that can eventually lead to 
a team becoming more open and honest about how they feel about projects 
and working together. Sharing feelings with team members comes more 
easily as the team relates to each other through sharing.

T
raining is time-consuming, costs money, and is the best investment that 
your company can ever make. Training your novices as well as your vet­
erans pays off in the end — but only if you manage training so that the new 
information sticks in their minds.
Research that shows how malleable the brain is proves that we can teach old 
dogs new tricks. If you have a trainer or training company that understands 
how the brain learns and changes, how to emotionally charge the learning, 
and how to get people to have fun, real, permanent change can occur. That 
change is most likely to happen if you expect and encourage employees to 
learn.
Most trainings and presentations are built to teach information, but that 
doesn’t mean you learn it. In an old cartoon, a young boy points to his dog 
and says to a friend, “Hey, I taught my dog to talk!” The friend says, “I don’t 
hear him talking.” The boy remarks, “I said I taught him; I didn’t say he 
learned!”
This chapter provides you with information to set up trainings based on how 
the brain learns and remembers. Your training can be more than a training; it 
can be a learning experience that is remembered on both an intellectual level 
and an emotional level.

264
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Determining Where You Are and 
Where You Want to Go
A good training answers these three questions:
	
✓	Where are you now? Getting a sense of participants’ background 
knowledge enables the training to find a starting point that includes 
everyone.
	
✓	Where are you going? Before embarking on training, determine 
exactly where you want it to take your employees. For example, a 
recent sales training at an insurance company focused on two goals, 
one for each day of the training. Day one’s goal was finding new 
prospects. Day two’s target goal was to sharpen communication 
skills to close the sale.
	
✓	How can you get there? Design strategies for reaching different types of 
learners, addressing multiple intelligences, and enabling participants to 
store information in various areas of the brain.
These questions give you a roadmap for your training. The trainer who leads 
your sessions needs to create this map with you and others in your organiza­
tion who already know have reached these targets.
Following the leader
As the leader of your organization, you must 
model the appropriate behavior for a training. 
That means supporting your workforce by being 
present for the training. Showing your workers 
that you think the training is important and vital 
to the success of your business helps them 
focus on the new learning.
Emotions are contagious. If you act excited, 
that excitement transfers to the training partici­
pants. You also convey an important message 
to your trainers: you expect the training to be 
worthwhile and effective.
A colleague of mine once gave a training and 
was happy to see the CEO of the company in 
attendance to reinforce the importance of the 
information. During the training, although all 
of the trainees had been told to turn off their 
cell phones, the CEO’s phone was on. He took 
calls and spoke as though he were alone in his 
office. To upset the training even more, he went 
to the back corner of the room and conducted 
an interview during the training. A few of the 
trainees were noticeably distracted, but most 
seemed to be fully attentive. The evaluation 
and assessment for the day, however, revealed 
that the portion of the training that took place 
during the interview was least understood by 
the employees.

265
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
Showing Employees What’s in It for 
Them (And Other Motivational Ideas)
When it comes to training, one question hangs in the mind of every trainee: 
What’s in it for me? Abbreviated WIIFM and pronounced whiff ’em, this ques­
tion is the key to any training.
As the leader of the organization you can make employees go to a training. 
But making them go gets them there only physically. The real buy-in has to 
be an emotional one. Your job is to help participants find their individual 
WIIFMs. Making that connection from their jobs to their training makes a dif­
ference in how attentive they are and how much they remember. Meet with 
employees before the training to find and emphasize that connection.
Beyond what’s in it for them, a great motivational tool is you! If your employees 
have a rapport with you and respect you, and if they know that this training 
is important to you, they may be motivated.
	
Speak to each employee individually about the training. Explain the impor­
tance of the training to you, to the future of the company, and to the 
employee. Reach each one on an emotional level. Share your excitement! 
Share your passion! If the training group is too big for you to talk with each 
person, talk with teams or whatever combination of people makes sense.
One COO went to his employees and told them they were getting a day away. 
He was truly excited about the training they were going to have on customer 
service. He also was impressed with the trainer, had personally observed one 
of her trainings, and knew that they were going to have a good time as well as 
receive some valuable information. The day away got their attention, but his 
excitement really convinced them that this was an important training. 
What makes a highly motivated trainee? As I tell you in Chapter 8, the brain 
is motivated by two things: desire and need. The brain is alert to information 
that’s going to meet its needs or its desires. Trainees must either feel the 
need to learn at the training, or they must want to learn.
Situations that might induce a need for your trainees include
	
✓	Earning a new position 
	
✓	Keeping their current position
	
✓	Competing with others on their team
	
✓	Competing with other businesses

266
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Situations that might induce a desire to learn for your trainees might include
	
✓	Wanting to please you: If you have built a good relationship with your 
employees, they are more likely to want to please you.
	
✓	Wanting more recognition: If you provide praise and recognition, they 
know that learning new information for the business may lead to more 
praise and recognition.
	
✓	A desire to beat the competition: This could be outside competition or 
healthy competition within the department or team.
	
✓	Wanting to achieve a goal: They may know that the training can help 
them achieve the goal of their team at work.
	
✓	Wanting to meet others’ expectations: Their team leader, you, their 
team members
	
✓	Wanting to be respected for their knowledge: Who doesn’t want to feel 
smart?
	
Dale Carnegie said that the sweetest sound anyone ever heard was his or her 
name. For this reason alone, be sure to have name tags for your attendees and 
the trainer. Carnegie also said that the one topic everyone liked to talk about 
was him- or herself. Fulfill this need by offering some “get to know each other” 
activities.
Managing Sticky Trainings
A training with the brain in mind is well-organized and has been well-practiced. 
Whether you hire an outside trainer or someone in-house can do the job, 
preparation makes all of the difference.
Choosing the content
The content determines the amount of time necessary for the training. “Spray 
and pray” trainings in which participants are given more information than 
their brains can handle and sent on their way to apply it are brain antago­
nistic and ineffective. The brain needs time to connect new information to 
already-stored information. It needs time to rehearse that information. (And 
as I tell you in Chapter 15, it needs sleep to convert short-term memories into 
long-term memories.)
Training content may be predetermined by a needs assessment. This assess­
ment may be informal — for example, you may set training needs as an 
agenda item for your senior leadership team or for meetings with all of your 

267
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
team leaders. You may have your leadership team create a needs assessment 
or survey for every employee to fill out. There is no perfect needs assess­
ment that’s appropriate for every organization. 
Here are some general questions you might include in a needs assessment:
	
✓	In which areas are you interested in further training? (List potential 
areas below question.)
	
✓	Select the most convenient day and time for you for training. (List spe­
cific days and times.)
	
✓	Which method of training do you prefer? (List options such as online 
training, on-the-job training, and so on.)
	
✓	What is the number-one topic you would like training for?
Selecting the trainer
If you hire an outside trainer, be certain that the trainer you hire knows your 
content and understands your business needs. This classic training story is 
always good for a laugh, but it is also food for thought. A company hired a 
trainer to work with employees on time management. The employees arrived 
at the training site eager to begin. It came time to start the session, but the 
trainer wasn’t there. Ten minutes later . . . still no trainer. When the company 
manager called the trainer, he said, “Oh, was that this week? I thought it was 
next week.” Know your trainer.
A trainer who understands the brain can vary her presentation to meet the 
needs of the trainees. Interview the trainer and be certain you’re getting what 
you want. The trainer who says she can offer a training that meets the needs 
of each of the multiple intelligences as I describe in Chapter 7 should be able 
to offer you an outline of what she can do to meet those needs.
Following are some suggestions for choosing a trainer:
	
✓	Ask for credentials.
	
✓	Ask for references.
	
✓	Check out trainers on the Internet.
	
✓	Interview the trainer — preferably in person, but at least over the 
phone, and try to get a feel for the type of presenter he is.
	
✓	Ask for outlines of the material.
	
✓	Check to see whether the trainer provides follow-up for the training in 
the form of updates, coaching, or informal gatherings.

268
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Choosing the setting, creating the 
atmosphere
The most effective trainings occur off-site. When trainings are given onsite, 
trainees are torn between concentrating on the new information and work 
they need to get done. Onsite trainings include more interruptions — train­
ees are often late returning from breaks and lunch because they try to com­
plete work during that time, and less training takes place.
	
If you’re simply stuck with the company training room in which every one 
of your employees has already been trained, change the setup of that room. 
For a training to impress the brain and make your participants interested and 
excited, you need to grab their attention immediately with a new atmosphere.
Check the room to make sure there are no distractions. Jack, an employee 
at one of the major automobile manufacturers told me about a training that 
he was really looking forward to. He had his entire work crew pumped up 
to learn a faster way to get their jobs done with fewer mistakes. When the 
training began, so did the noisy blower on the air conditioner. Every few min­
utes, it started up and made concentration nearly impossible. His coworkers 
thought it was a total waste of time, and it took a few days before morale 
sprang back.
An effective way to change the atmosphere of any training room is to play 
music. Research strongly suggests that the brain responds to music. I often 
have the Beatles or the Beach Boys playing as I begin my trainings. The 
music energizes me, and it provides a background for conversation as train­
ees arrive. Often people are reluctant to begin conversations in a quiet room. 
With music playing, the participants feel that their conversations are more 
private and no one can hear them. If the training is starting later in the day 
after participants have been working, play calming music.
If the set-up of the room has always been theater style or perhaps trainees 
always sit around a conference table, you can nonetheless design other for­
mats. Check with your trainer to see what he or she is comfortable with or 
perhaps offers some of the following options:
	
✓	Round tables make trainees more likely to interact with each other. 
When the participants sit only halfway around the table, they have clear 
sightlines to the trainer and training materials, as well.
	
✓	U-shaped designs offer visibility if participants don’t sit on both sides of 
the tables.
	
✓	Diagonal table set ups allow for visibility, interaction, and participation.
Many trainers prefer round table arrangements for participation and move­
ment possibilities. If the room doesn’t have windows, moods and attitudes 
may take a bad turn because they lack feel-good brain chemicals, like 

269
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
serotonin, whose release is affected by sunlight. If the training room is short 
on sunlight, be sure the training includes some short “road trips” to areas 
with natural light.
Organizing and Presenting Information
In order to present a training with the brain in mind, you might consider sev­
eral basic brain rules. Brains handle information best if it has been chunked 
into workable, understandable, easily stored bits of information. If you want 
the trainees to truly attend to the learning, it must be interesting and engag­
ing. Boring is not an option. Along with those needs, the brain requires occa­
sional breaks, some downtime in order to process the new information. And 
finally, brains like to work together. Trainees gain from each other’s experi­
ences and group work lowers stress and raises memory.
Brains like chunks
Cognitive psychologists sometimes disagree on the amount of information 
that the brain can hold at one time. Researchers believe that the human brain 
can hang on to five, six, or seven bits of information for only about 30 sec­
onds. The brain needs continual engagement with information to maintain it 
in working memory.
The best trainers understand how memory works and chunk information 
into memorable parts. The human brain remembers best what is presented 
first, and remembers second best what is presented last. (This is called the 
primacy-recency effect or the serial position effect.) The middle of any training 
session is the least-remembered section.
Dr. David Sousa, author of several books on the brain, calls the first part of 
a training, where retention is high, prime time 1. The second time for high 
retention — the information you hear last — is prime time 2. Researchers 
aren’t sure how long prime time 1 may be. Most believe that ability to focus 
is age-dependent until the age of 22. After that point, focus time is about 
20 minutes.
At the beginning of a training episode, most participants focus on the trainer 
with an interest in learning or finding out what this training is all about. During 
this time, the trainer needs to hook trainees with something novel or emotional 
and then begin teaching the new idea, skill, or concept. This prime time for reten­
tion may last no longer than 20 minutes, and so many trainers pause at the eight 
to ten minute mark for a minute or two to allow trainees to jot down information, 
share the information with another trainee, or compare notes with someone 
sitting close by. The training then resumes until the 20-minute mark in which 
another practice time, reflection time, or comparison of ideas might be shared.

Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Down time gives the brain an opportunity to organize information and con­
nect it to similar information already stored for later processing. During 
prime time 2, the brain processes this information. This method is much dif­
ferent from the old training adage which allowed no processing time: “Tell 
them what you are going to tell them, tell them, and then tell them what you 
told them.” The brain needs time to process if you want your employees to 
retain information. Prime time 2 may be a review or a different approach to 
the information that was presented during prime time 1.
	
In a 40-minute session, for example, you might want to schedule approxi­
mately 30 minutes of training and 10 minutes for processing. If the training is 
lengthy, fill it with segments of this kind. An all-day training, say from 8 until 4, 
would have roughly 10 to 12 of these training periods.
Brains don’t attend to boring things
In this digital age where information doubles every two years, anyone can 
find answers to important questions by typing a few words into Google, and 
people spend about two seconds on a Web site before moving on to the 
next, the brain has become accustomed to fast-paced, novel enticements. 
Trainings can offer no less.
In 1933, Hedwig von Restorff conducted memory experiments that focused 
on novelty. She gave groups of participants lists of items that were similar — 
except for one isolated item. The lists looked something like this:
Bird
Dog
Horse
Cat
Tiger
Lassie
Cow
Sheep
Goat
“Lassie” stands out because it is different, a proper noun in a list of common 
nouns. Participants more often remembered “Lassie” than any of the other 
items in the list. 
The point of these experiments and others that followed is that people 
remember novelty — in this case, something different from the things around 
it. Advertisers use this concept when they try to convince you to remember 
their product over others. The drawback is that the novel or surprising ele­
ment, though very memorable, makes you less likely to remember the other 
information in the list. The trick is to make the novel idea a trigger for the 
other information.

Changes that make trainings more interesting include
	
✓	Change of state: After a period of time, the brain begins to wander to 
thoughts other than the training. Some ideas for revving up the brain 
include
 
• Having everyone stand for a few minutes as the training continues.
 
• Asking everyone to take a deep breath.
 
• The trainer and trainees changing positions in the room.
 
• The trainer changing her tone or volume.
 
• Asking trainees to stand, find a partner, and discuss the most-
recently covered topic for two minutes.
 
• Asking trainees to stand and find three people in the room they 
don’t know, introduce themselves, and tell why they’re attending 
the training.
	
✓	Change of presentation: Lecture works for short periods of time, but 
the areas of the brain used to learn and understand lecture lose energy. 
By changing the format of the content, you let that brain area rest and 
rejuvenate so it can work proficiently again at a later time. Some ways to 
change the presentation include the following:
 
• Using small group activities to reinforce information.
 
• Showing video clips
 
• Asking for suggestions to connect the new learning to what is cur­
rently known or being done at work.
 
• Having participants create questions that others might ask about 
the information.
	
✓	Change of activities: Different people learn in different ways. Vary activi­
ties according to learning preferences by
 
• Using hands-on activities for those who need to learn with their 
bodies.
 
• Using visuals to show learners who need to see the information.
 
• Having participants teach each other the information that has been 
presented in whatever format they think is most effective.
The brain likes breaks
Some leaders shudder when they hear that the brain needs breaks. They 
think breaks are only for those who are unmotivated and care little for suc­
cess. I remind them of the Dale Carnegie story about the two men chopping 
wood. One man rested only to quickly eat, while the other took frequent 

272
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
breaks. At the end of the day the man who worked continually was amazed to 
see that the other man had chopped more wood than he had. When he asked 
how this could be, the man who rested asked, “Didn’t you see that while I 
was resting I was sharpening my ax?”
This is a wonderful metaphor for taking care of your brain and your memory. 
Breaks are necessary to rest and prime your brain for learning. The adult 
brain can focus for no more than 20 minutes. What happens when those 20 
minutes are up can transform your effective training into one that is not only 
ineffective but into an outright nightmare.
If the trainer is lucky, before the 20-minute mark when he might lose all the 
participants to fuzzy thinking, someone in the session is blatant about the 
need for change. Some trainers use a 1-2-3 rule. If one person gets up to use 
the restroom, keep on training. When a second person is having trouble 
keeping their eyes open, it may have been a rough night and training can 
continue. But if a third person looks like he has mentally left the training or 
follows person number 1 into the restroom, it’s time for a break.
Brain breaks do not have to be breaks from training. Brain breaks can be 
content-related. Consider the training format when fuzzy brain sets in:
	
✓	If it is a lecture and the participants are not climbing over each other in 
a desperate attempt to get away from the training, then the break can 
be content-related. For example, the trainer may ask the participants 
to take a few minutes to think about where in their job description this 
content would fit. She could then ask trainees to share their thoughts.
	
✓	If it is shortly after lunch and members of the audience have glazed 
eyes, a state change may take care of the problem — maybe a 30-second 
stretch during which the trainer continues sharing information.
	
✓	If a small-group discussion is in progress and some trainees are frus­
trated with the discussion or with someone in their group, redirect the 
conversation.
	
Changes such as these add to rather than detract from the training content. 
Training goals don’t change, and if you’re worried about loss of time, keep in 
mind that if you don’t keep trainees’ attention, they don’t keep the information.
You might want to incorporate brain breaks directly into your training plan. 
Here are some ideas for brain breaks that work wonders:
	
✓	Play Simon Says. In addition to being fun, Simon Says wakes people up 
and emphasizes the importance of listening — all in just minutes.
	
✓	Pair and share. Trainees find a partner (preferably not one at their 
table) and share what they have learned thus far.
	
✓	Review in groups. Have trainees form groups of four. Ask each group to 
come up with a few key points that have been covered so far.

273
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
	
✓	Get graphic. Have employees form groups of four. Provide each group a 
piece of poster board and markers, and ask them to create a visual that 
depicts the main points of the training.
	
✓	Conduct a mini-Q&A. Instruct each participant to make up a quick ques­
tion about the content and then ask the person next to them to answer it.
	
✓	Connect the content. Ask trainees to discuss in small groups one prob­
lem or concern with the information in the training as it relates to their 
job or their current approach to the topic.
The brain likes company
Some research suggests that putting trainees in pairs or small groups 
increases each trainee’s retention of the material. Pairs might increase reten­
tion about 6 percent and groups of three or four people may bump that up to 
9 percent.
	
Put participants in groups with different people from the ones they chose to 
sit with at the beginning of the training. Splitting up friends and friendly co-
workers lowers the risk of trainees losing focus on the task and instead catch­
ing up on personal conversations.
Any group activity that includes working with content feeds the memory pro­
cess in two important ways:
	
✓	It provides an opportunity to rehearse the information. If the training is 
for new recruits or revolves around new product lines or concepts, the 
amount of rehearsal time needs to be very high when compared to a 
training that brushes up employees on sales or product information.
	
✓	Whether participants form relationships or not, their reactions to other 
trainees cause some of this information to be tagged as emotional 
memory, the most powerful memory system in the brain.
Moving from Concrete to 
Abstract Information
Trainers often develop their trainings according to their own learning style, 
but they’re better off varying their methods so that their trainings address 
each kind of learning. Although there are many ways of looking at learning 
styles, the brain stores information both concretely and abstractly:
	
✓	Concrete learners are inclined to focus on immediate reality and prefer 
real-life examples, explicit directions, and using their five senses. They 

274
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
learn best when they move from the concrete to the abstract in a step-
by-step sequence. They value practical knowledge and tend to be pre­
cise and accurate in their work. They tend to excel at memorizing facts.
	
✓	Abstract learners are comfortable creating theories about what they 
hear and observe. They tend to look at the big picture to get an overall 
impression of what’s happening and often leap to a conceptual under­
standing of material. They may be inattentive during sessions that pre­
dominantly give factual information.
Some learners can learn in either fashion; some require a concrete approach 
to then lead them to the abstract ideas. Many trainings share strategies and 
ideas, and so naturally abstract learners have an easier time. Concrete learn­
ers need a bridge from concrete to abstract.
To meet the needs of both concrete and abstract learners try the following:
	
✓	Begin the training with the big picture. For example, if you’re teaching 
sales people how to sell a new product, the big picture might be that 
learning the three things this product can do to change the lives of cus­
tomers. Abstract learners need the big picture.
	
✓	Give real-life examples. Show video clips, pictures, or charts that go 
along with stories of how this product changed lives. Concrete learners 
relate well to this step.
	
✓	Use hands-on activities. Enable the trainees to work with the product to 
see how it works and get a feel for how it might affect others. Concrete 
learners especially like the physical contact with the product; abstract 
learners may do more talking and throw out ideas about the product.
	
✓	Step by step, show trainees how the product works and what the ben­
efits are. Have them work in groups or pairs to practice ways of sharing 
this information with customers. Together, abstract and concrete learn­
ers come up with big ideas and steps for selling the product.
	
Abstract and concrete learners make great teams. They cover ideas as well as 
facts, and they fill in any gaps for each other when they work together.
Creating Memories That Stick
Before it can begin the memory process, the brain filters incoming informa­
tion for emotional content first. If you start a training by reaching trainees on 
an emotional level, you lay a foundation that makes remembering the impor­
tant information to come easier and more effective.

275
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
Storytelling is one of the best ways to connect emotionally with trainees. A 
story often helps the listener relate to the trainer. I sometimes tell the story 
about how I became interested in learning more about the brain. I attended a 
training that included brain research applications for teaching my university 
classes. I was so fascinated that I continually tried to “pick the brain” of the 
trainer. At the end of the week, he asked whether I would like to be trained to 
present his training sessions. I immediately turned him down because I was 
apprehensive about traveling with strangers, leaving my family regularly, and 
change in general. I went home at the end of the week of training upset with 
myself and my fears. I pouted so much that my husband begged me to leave!
My story relates to many people on an emotional level. They think about 
their fears, the changes they want to make, and even their significant others 
at home. They laugh at the ending, and humor releases feel-good chemicals 
in the brain that facilitate learning.
For decades, researchers believed that information was stored in one area 
of the brain, and therefore how you learned or how you trained didn’t seem 
to matter. Current research shows that memory is stored in multiple brain 
areas and that utilizing more of the brain’s memory systems, or pathways, in 
training enables the brain to store more long-term memories.
If you want your trainings to truly stick, you want your trainer to access mul­
tiple memory systems. Two kinds of memory exist: 
	
✓	Declarative memories are those that you can talk about. You are con­
sciously aware of those memories. “My company has 50 employees” is 
an example. This is a fact and you can tell others that fact.
	
✓	Non-declarative memory consists of those memories that are not in our 
conscious awareness. This category includes things that you do almost 
automatically, like riding a bike and driving a car.
Declarative and non-declarative memory systems can be broken down into 
several more distinctive memory systems, each of which has unique charac­
teristics and can be used effectively in trainings:
	
✓	Semantic memory is factual and conceptual. All of the text in the train­
ing manual, the lectures in the training, and any audio or video informa­
tion is considered semantic. In other words — all the words! Semantic 
information is the most difficult type of information for the brain to 
learn. It requires high motivation and must pass through several tempo­
rary memory systems before it can be stored in long-term memory.

276
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
✓	Episodic memory relates to events, locations, and people. Research 
shows that if you learn something in an airplane, you remember it better 
when you’re in an airplane. If you learn something underwater you 
remember it better underwater.
	
	Episodic memory sometimes relies on location. The more unique a set­
ting is, the more memorable it is. Transferring information from one 
location to another is easier if the locations are similar. If your employees 
are training in a technical skill that they will use in a specific location, 
have them practice these skills in the location where they will use them. 
Medical schools don’t train surgical techniques in a classroom; they 
train future surgeons in an operating room.
	
✓	Emotional memory is a very strong memory system. If you learn some­
thing in an emotional way, your brain — which is always filtering incom­
ing information for emotion — marks the memory and calls on many 
different brain areas to remember the information.
	
	Emotional memory may be the most powerful way to make your training 
stick. If your trainees feel that the training will make a difference, they 
are more likely to remember it. If you have clearly established what’s in 
it for them, they are more likely to remember. Your training must create 
excitement, passion, and drive. You establish these emotions through 
the environment, the passion of the trainer, and the modeling that you, 
the leader, provide.
	
✓	Procedural memory is sometimes called muscle memory. It involves 
movement and processes. This is skill learning, and it’s vital to trainings 
in which participants need to learn how to use or repair a product or 
how to use a program.
	
	Procedural memory may be a large part of any technical training. Just 
as location is important, learning the procedures in the correct location 
is also enormously important. This memory system can be associated 
with location as well. When trainees are learning how to run a computer 
program, physical practice places much of the memory of using the pro­
gram in procedural memory.
	
✓	Conditioned response memory is sometimes best explained through 
antonyms. I say hot and you automatically reply cold.
	
	Conditioned response memory is often used for information that is dif­
ficult to remember. Flashcards help trainees commit vocabulary via 
conditioned response memory, and so do memory devices like putting 
information to music or creating rhymes.
	
Sticky trainings utilize most of these memory systems. The more places in the 
brain a memory is stored, the easier it is to retrieve.

Move It or Lose It: How Movement 
Enhances Learning
In recent years, staggering numbers of studies have shown convincingly that 
movement helps learning occur. In studies at schools, for example, physical 
activity led to improvement in grades and test scores, not to mention reading.
Promoting movement in your trainings takes little time and offers employees’ 
brains more oxygen and better blood flow throughout the body. It promotes 
the release of brain chemicals that enhance motivation. And movement also 
helps wake up sleep-deprived employees! Here are a few ideas for working 
movement into training sessions:
	
✓	At the beginning of the training, have participants stand and find some­
one they don’t know well. Give them a few minutes to introduce them­
selves and find three things they have in common.
	
✓	Ask trainees to walk around the room and make three appointments 
with three different people at times you set. (For example, have them 
make a 10 o’clock, 1 o’clock, and 3 o’clock appointment.) When those 
times arrive, trainees go to their appointments and discuss whatever 
aspects of the training you suggest.
	
✓	Instruct participants to stand up when they answer yes to a question.
Not a lot of hot air
I was helping a trainer prepare a presentation 
to some heating and cooling distributors. As he 
went through the features and benefits of this 
new furnace, he said that the furnace had a 
two-speed blower that provided more comfort. 
I told him that he needed to help his trainees 
convince customers that the statement was 
true, so I asked him to convince me. He thought 
a moment and then told me to hold my hand 
about four inches in front of my mouth. He then 
told me to blow on my hand like I was blow­
ing out a candle. Next, he asked me to open my 
mouth wide and simply breathe on my hand. He 
asked, “Which feels warmer?” I told him that 
the slower-moving air felt warmer. When he 
pointed out that the air temperature was the 
same whether I was blowing hard or exhaling 
gently, I understood the benefit of the furnace’s 
two-speed blower. He taught the trainees to 
use that example when explaining this feature 
and benefit. Because he had me participate and 
he caused an emotional reaction since I “felt” 
better with the warm air on my hand, this expe­
rience was more memorable.

278
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
✓	When you solicit opinions or agreement, send participants to one side of 
the room if they agree and the other side if they disagree.
	
✓	If weather allows, ask participants to take a walk with a partner and dis­
cuss points from the training.
	
✓	Give trainees time to physically demonstrate what they have learned. 
For example, role playing a sales pitch or repairing a machine.
	
✓	Tell participants that the last person at their table who stands up must 
answer the question that you have posted on a slide or flipchart.
Going through the motions: 
Procedural memory
Procedural memory is formed by making movements repeatedly. Procedures 
help free up working memory — the temporary storage process that every­
one uses constantly. Working memory, however, is fragile and small — it 
can hold only about seven bits of information. As your employees are being 
trained, they hold information in working memory, and if their brains can 
connect this information to something they already know, they have a 
greater chance of working that information into long-term memory.
Remember that procedural memory is like a muscle memory. After the 
information is stored in the motor area of your brain, you don’t have to 
consciously think about it anymore. Because you don’t have to focus on it, 
it doesn’t take up any space in working memory. For instance, in the retail 
clothing business, new merchandise is handled in a procedural manner:
	
1.	As soon as the delivery service drops off the boxes of clothing, the 
packing slips are removed and the merchandise on the slips are com­
pared to the merchandise orders.
	
2.	If the packing slip and the order match, the merchandise is taken out 
of the boxes and hung on the appropriate hangers.
	
3.	Sales tags are printed out and placed on each garment.
	
4.	Garments that need to be steamed are hung in the steaming room.
	
5.	After the steaming is complete, the garments are checked in on the 
computer with the arrival date and the date they are displayed for 
customers.
	
6.	The garments are then placed on the sales floor in an appropriate 
spot.
This procedure becomes second nature to the merchandise team. If Helen 
is receiving packages and one of the salespeople comes back to ask her a 
question about sizes in an order that has yet to arrive, Helen can answer the 

279
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
question as she continues to work. She does not have to consciously attend 
to every step in the procedure because it has become second nature to her.
Procedures can save you time and money. Some managers ask trainees to 
watch for aspects of the training in which procedures can be set up. Employees 
more easily remember procedures that they create, and the procedures enable 
employees to be more receptive to the information they are learning.
Stressing the importance of exercise
You would be remiss as a leader if you did not understand the value of exer­
cise for your trainees and all of your employees. Aerobic exercise can liter­
ally cut your risk of Alzheimer’s by 50 percent, according to the research of 
Dr. John Medina, author of Brain Rules. Research shows that if you take a 
20-minute walk each day, you cut your risk of stroke by 50 percent. Those are 
a few of the health benefits.
Some studies show that the continual integration of oxygen to the brain aids 
cognition. Here are a few exercise options to help training stick:
	
✓	Rather than sitting in chairs, have trainees who are interested and capa­
ble walking on a treadmill during the training.
	
✓	Provide morning and afternoon exercise breaks of at least 20 minutes.
	
✓	Conduct part of the training on a walking track or outside where trainer 
and trainees can walk one to two miles per hour.
	
✓	Keep the hours of the training within reason so participants have time to 
exercise as well as get a good night’s sleep.
Exercise releases stress. Trainings can be stressful for some employees. If the 
stress is not relieved, stress hormones build up in the brain and body and 
compromise focus and attention.
Getting the Story through Pictures
If I ask you to picture the Eiffel Tower, what happens? It pops right up in your 
mind; whether you’ve seen it in Paris or in a picture, the vision is stored in 
your brain. Using visuals can make a difference in what trainees remember. 
The occipital lobe stores visual information and is attracted to certain types 
of information. What you see is sometimes what you get — as far as under­
standing information. The brain 
	
✓	Pays attention to pictures
	
✓	Is drawn to color

280
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
✓	Notices different sizes
	
✓	Reacts to motion
Yes, a picture is worth a thousand words. You likely remember only 10 per­
cent of information that you hear three days after the fact, but if you see a 
picture, the percentage of information that you remember goes up to 65!
	
Using visuals in trainings goes a long way toward making sure your employees 
“get the picture.” Try some of the following tips for adding visuals to your 
training:
	
✓	Take a look at the PowerPoint presentations you currently use and redo 
them using more still pictures and animations.
	
✓	Look for opportunities to add visuals to your training manual. Think 
about adding color if your budget allows.
	
✓	Prime trainees’ brains with pictures. Before the training, place pictures 
that relate to the training in the office or workspace. Prime their eyes 
and their brains for the new information or product. When they enter 
the training and see some of the same visuals, they may relax a bit 
because they feel somewhat familiar with it. This intentional priming 
may also wake up a few stored memories relating to the product, pro­
cess, or idea.
Engage! Engage! Engage!
The trainer has presented information, and trainees seem to understand. It 
is time to engage them in rehearsals of the material. Some research suggests 
that a person needs 24 to 28 engagements with new material to move it into 
long-term memory.
If the trainer used different memory systems to help participants understand 
the new learning, then fewer rehearsals may be necessary. For trainees to 
benefit most they need to practice this material in an environment that is at 
least similar to where they will utilize the information. It is time to take the 
trainees’ knowledge and do some elaborative rehearsal. Elaborative rehearsal 
goes beyond simply repeating information and engages participants in some 
kind of interaction with the material.
Review the newly learned concepts or skills throughout the day. At the end 
of the training day, review again. This review may take the form of a game. 
According to Bob Pike, professional training consultant, “Learning is directly 
proportional to the amount of fun you have.” Make it fun to make it stick!

281
 Chapter 18: Holding Sticky Training Sessions
Try working the following rehearsal strategies into any training session:
	
✓	Pair up trainees and have them teach each other.
	
✓	Have volunteer trainees demonstrate the information. Doing so is partic­
ularly important for a sales training in which trainees are learning a new 
sales pitch. The pitch should sound natural and sincere, which happens 
through practice.
	
✓	Play games with the information. (Jeopardy is a favorite.)
	
✓	Have trainees write about the training.
	
✓	Have trainees draw pictures of the training.
	
✓	Ask trainees to share with others how this training information is going 
to change their jobs.
	
✓	Offer on-the-job training.
Feedback: Memory’s Significant Other
The brain loves to know how it’s doing. Continual feedback throughout a 
training is important for keeping trainees’ focus on the road map. They need 
to think about where they’re going and how they’re getting there. Short con­
ferences and conversations allow trainees to ask questions they might not 
ask in front of the group. Learning and feedback are ammunition for hitting 
the targets (goals). Rehearsal and review are the target practice.
Practice makes permanent
When it comes to sticky trainings, practice is 
the glue. The old saying that practice makes 
perfect has been updated to reflect current 
knowledge about how the brain works. Practice 
can make perfect only if trainees really under­
stand what they’re supposed to store in their 
memories — that is, perfect practice makes 
perfect. One of the biggest pitfalls in teaching 
and training is not checking to make sure that 
the trainees really have the information straight 
in their minds. After you know that they have it, 
they need to practice it.
You may wonder how much practice is enough. 
In his book Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell hypoth­
esizes that to be really great at something, an 
expert needs to practice about 10,000 hours. 
Clearly, one-shot training is not enough to 
create experts. Your employees need practice 
in order for any information to become second 
nature to them.

282
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
Having a place for trainees to place sticky notes with questions and comments 
provides the trainer feedback from the trainees. Some trainers put a large 
piece of paper on the wall asking for concerns. Trainees write these notes 
anonymously, and the trainer reads them throughout the day and addresses 
their content.
Most trainings provide time at the end of the training for participants to 
demonstrate their learning in some way — demonstrations or role play, for 
example. After such an exercise, a written assessment by the trainer can offer 
suggestions for improvement and positive reinforcement for their efforts. 
The assessment of their work may be as simple as:
You did a great job at . . . .
Your technique could be improved by . . . .
I enjoyed having you in the training because . . . .
Some trainings have written assessments that ask trainees specific questions 
about the training. Other trainings have participants write papers describing 
the training strategies or techniques in relation to their jobs. Written assess­
ments are fine, but actively engaging trainees in formats that demonstrate 
what they have learned is usually more fun and allows yet another rehearsal 
for those observing the performance.
When trainees leave the training on a positive note, their brains are more 
likely to retain the information, and they will be happier about returning for 
more training.
Evaluations at the end of the day are valuable to you as the leader, and may 
help the trainer during a multiple-day training. However, if the training is one 
day only with follow-up at a later date, try asking employees for an evaluation 
of the training mid-day so that the trainer gets an idea of what trainees don’t 
understand or don’t like about the training. I often hand out index cards with 
a 3-2-1 format:
Describe three things you have learned.
Write two questions that you have.
Share one idea or strategy you can use immediately.
On the back of the card, trainees write suggestions for the training. The 
trainer has time to review or make changes for the second half of the day.

through experience. As a sculptor, you would mold your material or chip 
away at it to transform it into a beautiful or useful entity. As a leader, you 
can shape the brains of new employees through teaching and training so that 
they can make a difference in your organization.
When a sculptor discovers that his creation needs changes, does he throw 
it away and start over? No, he adds more clay and remolds it, or he chisels 
away at some of the stone to create a masterpiece. In much the same way, 
you can redesign brains of employees who’ve been on the job but haven’t 
kept up with changes in the company.
Training minds to learn the skills that your organization needs is necessary 
to move your organization forward. Brain growth and change equals organi­
zation growth and change. Whether you’re designing brains of new employees 
who need to understand the purpose of your company and learn skills to 
contribute to its growth or retraining those veterans who have helped make 
the business what it is today but need to refine their skills or learn new ones, 
you need to lead them to your way of thinking.
In this chapter, you discover how brains learn and change, how to help 
reshape and redefine veteran brains, and how to lead both to places they 
have not been before.

Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Designing Brains: Training New Employees
For years educators thought that the brain was a vessel that could be filled 
with information. Today, neuroscience knows that the brain is plastic — that 
it changes through its experiences. The brain can bloom, or grow new con­
nections, and also prune by allowing no-longer-used connections to wither 
and die. When you have new hires with little prior knowledge of your busi­
ness, you can design their brains and make them great employees.
	
Even brains that are new to your business and haven’t been trained for spe­
cific tasks aren’t blank slates. Everyone comes with her own background 
knowledge and experiences. You nonetheless have the opportunity to create 
networks in these brains that provide connections to your business and the 
skills these people need. You can design a brain for your business.
Imagine that you need a road from your house to your place of business. You 
have purchased a new home in an area that has never before been connected 
to the busy downtown area of your town. Using maps and satellites, you 
determine the best way to make a path. As you follow the path, you may find 
a few physical limitations, perhaps a river bed or a small mountainous area 
that did not show up on the satellite pictures. You refine your map and make 
the proper corrections to eliminate the need for extra work or extra time to 
get to your destination.
When you try out the new path, your car can’t even get through, but as you 
walk the path and begin to remove bushes and rocks, you eventually have 
a trail. You can now get from home to work. But you have only a path, and 
you require a street. As you use this pathway and remove more obstacles, it 
becomes smoother and wider, and soon your car can make it down the road. 
You lay concrete to make your travel smoother and save some time getting to 
the office. As more and more other vehicles begin to use your street, you may 
find that it needs to be widened and perhaps made into a highway so people 
can travel even faster and many more people can use the path.
Certainly building this road was a process, but because there were few obsta­
cles in the way, the project was easier. Newcomers to your business have 
fewer obstacle as they are trained and networks are laid down in their brains. 
The first time they are offered training information, their path from receiving 
it to storing it in their brains may be a little slow — after all, they’re blazing 
a new trail in their brains. As they practice the skills and concepts, the path 
becomes a street. With application of the new learning, the network becomes 
even stronger and faster, just as the street became the highway.
These new employees who have a clear path don’t confuse old learning with 
the new learning. They do not ask questions or make comments such as
“Wouldn’t it be easier doing this the old way?”

285
 Chapter 19: Changing Minds: Training by Redesigning Brains
“In my department, we found that a method like this took longer.”
“I don’t see how this is going to change anything.”
These statements and questions stem from prior knowledge and fully 
ingrained habits of doing things in a certain way. Because these brains pre­
sumably don’t have prior knowledge of old skills or strategies, they are less 
likely to challenge the learning.
Creating new brain places
Most trainings try to appeal to your semantic memory system. (See Chap-
ter 18.) The trainer gives information and expects it to stick. However, the 
semantic memory system is the most difficult for the brain to use. Education 
has taken the semantic approach for years — read a text, discuss it, and then 
test to see whether students remember it. Because so many students learned 
to remember material for a test, the system seemed to work. But this process 
prepares participants for tests that occur immediately after the “lessons” 
have taken place. It doesn’t involve long-term memory. Working memory 
holds the information just long enough for the test, and then the information 
is usually forgotten.
Business or corporate trainings must be designed differently. As Chapter 
18 shows you, the more emotion involved in learning, the more easily you 
remember the information.
People remember information better when it’s attached to an emotion. A 
model for training these new brains would include answering the following 
questions:
	
✓	What? Explain exactly what the new hires are going to learn. But add 
an emotional touch. “Today you’re going to find out how to use the new 
widget” gets the job done, but this approach adds emotion: “Today 
you’re going on a journey to distant lands to find the secret to making 
life easier for your customers and earning greater commissions.” 
(Employees still find out about the widget but with an exotic spin that 
includes the widget’s Japanese origins.)
	
✓	Why? Let them know the purpose of this training in relation to what 
they will do for the company and its vision. This is a great time to bring 
in the CEO to dramatically share her vision using visuals and speaking 
with the passion she feels about the company.
	
✓	How? Share with the participants that they will be immersed into the 
training in order to instill lasting beliefs and habits to make their jobs 
easier and to contribute more to the company. Begin with real-life 
examples, personal experiences, or a virtual tour via the computer. 
Demonstrate what employees will be expected to do, and provide a lot 
of opportunity for practice.

286
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
Use brain-compatible strategies for teaching content by utilizing some of the 
following:
	
✓	Games
	
✓	Role-playing
	
✓	Mnemonics
	
✓	Storytelling
	
✓	Brainstorming
	
✓	Projects
	
✓	Hands-on activities
Coaching the new brains
A strong new-employee training program can make all the difference between 
employees who know what they’re doing and feel good about themselves, 
and those who still don’t have a clue. Training works. But it requires practice 
to keep those new networks primed and ready.
	
Hold at least part of your training session in the location where employees will 
use the information or skill they’re learning. Doing so gives these fresh faces 
and malleable brains the boost of episodic memory — the memory associated 
with location, people, and events. (Chapter 18 tells you more about episodic 
memory.)
Some experts believe that the first 60 to 90 days of coaching make the differ­
ence in retaining information from the training and in retaining the employee. 
And keep in mind that the person you want to coach a new employee is not the 
employee who is being replaced. Someone who is leaving your business to go 
somewhere else, whether the move was your idea or his, isn’t the best coach.
The best leaders have a new employee program in place for at least the first 
several weeks to reinforce training, answer questions, and create relation­
ships with the new staff members. Consider matching up each new employee 
with a mentor who stays with the employee throughout the day, introduces 
him to key people, reviews the employee handbook, and reinforces the first-
day training. This mentor should spend some time with the new employee 
each day for several days and check in occasionally for the first three months 
through planned meetings, lunches, or drop-ins to check for questions.
The mentor provides expertise and enthusiasm. Choose mentors who really 
know what the new employee must do to make a contribution to the organi­
zation and cheer her along the way. (See Chapter 4 for more information on 
mentoring and coaching.)

287
 Chapter 19: Changing Minds: Training by Redesigning Brains
Redesigning Brains: Helping Employees 
Train for Change
When organizations change, new job descriptions and new learning are 
part of the deal. The process of redesigning the adult brain brings with it 
the possibility of major changes. Change is not always easy. When current 
employees must change their way of thinking in order to meet new goals and 
challenges, resistance may be part of the process.
Limbic learning
Terri was thrilled to get her new job. After grad­
uating from college with a degree in history, she 
realized that few positions were available in her 
field if she didn’t want to become an educator. 
By working for a temp agency, she was placed 
in an online human resource position for a soft­
ware company. The company knew she had 
little training in this area, but she happened to 
be exactly what her employer wanted — some­
one without preconceived notions of how the 
job should be done.
Terri was given some training in using the soft­
ware she would need for the job. She learned 
this easily enough by practicing with the soft­
ware for hours. When it came time for her to 
really understand the purpose of the company 
she worked for and the leadership vision, learn­
ing online wasn’t sufficient. She needed more 
inspiration than she was getting. She found 
herself mechanically speaking with employees 
when trying to help them find their spots in the 
company. Although she recognized their tal­
ents, her lack of emotional attachment to the 
company made her less than effective.
Terri’s team leader began to question his deci­
sion to put so much effort into Terri’s training. 
Upon having a personal meeting with her, how­
ever, he was convinced that she lacked only 
knowledge and not motivation. Acting quickly, 
the company sent Terri for a one-week train­
ing that involved limbic learning. That is, the 
training was set up to engage participants on 
an emotional level. The CEO of Terri’s company 
came to the training and kicked off the meet­
ing with a passionate presentation in which 
she shared her vision, the mission, and the 
company values.
Each day of the training was built upon that 
passion. With the CEO setting the emotional 
standard for the training and remaining visible 
throughout the week, the emotional tempera­
ture of the participants remained high. Their 
limbic systems activated the release of brain 
chemicals that made memories stronger. Terri 
left the training with a different outlook on the 
importance of the company, the talent it needed 
to fulfill its mission, and the ability to share the 
vision with the employees she guided.

288
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Breaking habits, changing networks
Some habits are harder to break than others. Changing the brain’s networks 
requires breaking up existing connections and building new ones. This pro­
cess takes a lot of brain energy, as the following steps show:
	
1.	New information enters the brain and is held in working memory.
	
	 Working memory holds only a limited amount of information.
	
2.	The brain compares the new information with stored memories 
throughout the neocortex.
	
	 Because working memory is limited to five to seven bits of information, 
it makes the comparisons only in small chunks.
	
3.	The work of holding on to new information and comparing it to old 
information exhausts working memory and causes it to lose some of 
the information.
	
	 Because of the working memory’s fatigue, new memories may not be 
committed to long-term memory.
In the brains of your current workers, this attempt at learning new informa­
tion may be frustrating. People feel discomfort when given information that is 
contrary to what they already know and believe.
You know that 2 plus 2 equals 4, for example, and so when you’re suddenly 
told to change that thinking to 2 plus 2 equals 5, your brain detects an error 
and experiences a stress response that causes it to respond without thinking.
Changing networks that employees have practiced repeatedly is a challenge. 
To change the 2+2=4 network, for example, the brain has to override the 
impulse to activate the old network and instead activate a newly formed 2+2=5 
network. The process takes some time and is similar to changing a habit like 
smoking a cigarette after dinner. If you used to be a smoker and enjoyed a ciga­
rette after a meal, when you quit, the desire or the routine thought remains for 
some time. You eat, you think about lighting up, you toss that thought aside, 
and you find something else to do. Slowly, you overcome the habit. After 
several weeks, your thoughts only occasionally turn to having a cigarette after 
dinner. You have begun to replace that procedure with other things to do.
Imagine that you’re an employee who has worked for a firm for years. You 
have just been told that your job is changing. You need to be retrained in 
order to follow the correct procedures. As you begin to try out the new pro­
cess, you find yourself going back to the old routine. Your brain is used to 

289
 Chapter 19: Changing Minds: Training by Redesigning Brains
following specific steps, and now you have to stop yourself from following 
the old habit and refocus on the new one. Your thoughts and reactions likely 
mirror some or all of the following:
	
✓	The old way was comfortable.
	
✓	The old process or program worked well — even better than the new one.
	
✓	You feel angry because you don’t like the new system.
	
✓	You’re afraid you won’t be able to learn the system.
	
✓	Your stress levels rise as you try to learn the new information.
	
✓	Stress causes you to make more mistakes or forget some of the new 
information.
	
✓	You want to give up.
	
✓	You think you may lose your job.
	
✓	You think you may quit your job.
	
✓	You wonder why new employees caught on to the new system so easily.
As an employee’s brain reshapes itself in response to new learning, he may 
experience all kinds of different emotions. The reshaping nonetheless can 
take place. But it may be slower for some of these previously trained workers 
whose old networks have to be disconnected as new ones are built.
	
Overriding old networks takes time and practice. The more emotional the new 
networks are, the stronger they are and the more easily they replace old ones. 
Motivation and commitment to the new networks also speeds up the process.
Reinforcing changes
In order to reinforce the changes that have taken place from redesigning 
brains, you need to do the following:
	
✓	Apply new learning: Although some employees may be a little reluctant 
to implement what they have learned, doing so is a necessary step to rid 
them of the old habits and instill the new ones. The changes work best 
if employees apply their new learning immediately. Expect them to need 
coaching, which can be supplied by your trainer or by other employees 
who have had more training in the area.
	
✓	Integrate the changes: Make sure that employees at all levels in the 
department integrate the new way of doing things. The emotional mes­
sage is “we’re all in this together.” Employees are more likely to help 
each other if everyone is at similar levels of performance and working 
on the same strategies, programs, or techniques.

290
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
✓	Hold employees accountable: After a few weeks of repetition, the new 
networks in employees’ brains can make smooth connections. At that time, 
you can start holding employees accountable for utilizing their training. The 
method you use to measure the level of responsibility that the employees 
have achieved can vary according to the kind of training they received. It 
may be a change in profit, productivity, or proficiency. If you find that you 
aren’t getting the results you expected, you and your employees and per­
haps the trainer need to examine where the responsibility lies.
	
✓	Celebrate change: Whether you celebrate onsite or off, recognition 
and praise are part of keeping employees’ emotional connection to the 
changes strong.
As you reinforce the new learning, follow the progress of your employees. 
Doing so assists with the steps described above. You may want to do these 
three things:
	
✓	 Collect feedback from your newly retrained employees.
 
• Provide surveys.
 
• Have team meetings.
 
• Speak to team leaders.
 
• Examine data on productivity.
	
✓	Use this information to identify problems.
 
• Look for lack of motivation.
 
• Check stress levels.
 
• Identify employees resistant to changes.
	
✓	 Fix the problems.
 
• Speak with anyone who may be resistant.
 
• Correct misconceptions.
 
• Recognize individual successes.
Dealing with Minds That 
Are Difficult to Change
Katy was a great salesperson. She loved working with customers and never 
had a problem making sales. When her company switched computer pro­
grams and every sale had to be entered in the computer at the time of the 
sale, Katy rebelled. After an onsite training, all of the other employees caught 
on to the system right away. Katy still made sales, but she had to have 
another employee do her computer work.

291
 Chapter 19: Changing Minds: Training by Redesigning Brains
Katy was confronted by her employer. She admitted that she was afraid of 
making mistakes. She needed practice and confidence, and so her employer 
set up some time for her to practice, and practice, and practice. Finally, she 
became confident enough to make the change.
Resistance to change is a problem with some employees. While some employees 
look at change as an opportunity, others may see it as a punishment. For 
those who find that learning new skills or procedures is a problem, as their 
leader you must decide whether they still belong with your organization, 
whether you can do further training, or whether you can find another posi­
tion for them that doesn’t require the change.
Looking for solutions
When information has been ingrained in the brain for years and years, it is 
much harder to change. Sometimes employees feel totally stuck when they 
find themselves in a pattern that they can’t get out of. In this situation some 
leaders would say, “My way or the highway.” But a good leader takes a closer 
look at his employees. If what you see is loyalty, a strong work ethic, and 
talent that has contributed to more than just your bottom line, perhaps you 
need to offer this person a different opportunity.
You have probably put a lot of time and money into this employee. Training 
employees can become a huge expense. Loyalty is a hard commodity to find 
these days. You may try some of the following: 
	
✓	Determine whether you’re dealing with a real skill problem.
	
✓	If skills are there, check out the employee’s attitude.
	
✓	Examine your expectations of this employee.
	
✓	Verify that the employee understands those expectations.
	
✓	Check out the employee’s personnel file.
 
• Find out what positions the employee has held.
 
• Verify his productivity over the past several years.
	
✓	Look at other positions that are available within the company.
 
• Locate an open spot where this employee might fit in.
 
• Find another employee with whom this employee could switch 
positions.

Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Crossing digital and generational divides
The Boomer generation and the Traditionalists who came before them may 
be reluctant to take on some of the latest technology. These employees may 
have a hard time redesigning their brains with the latest digital media. You 
may need to approach any training that pairs workers of these generations 
and technology in a different format than you would other kinds of trainings. 
I suggest a “Before, During, and After” training format.
Before
Veteran employees used to the low-tech way of doing things are not against 
using technology. Rather, they feel that technology is often thrown at them, 
which gives them a sense of having no control over their work.
	
Ease them into possible changes and give them a chance to talk with you or 
their team leader about impending change. They may feel threatened by the 
younger generations’ ease with technology. Casually introduce them to the 
program or process you’re interested in having them learn. Then discuss 
the possibility of training to use the technology. Let them see the program in 
action at your company or at another place of business. Show them video pre­
sentations online. Be sure they understand how this new technology can help 
both the company and themselves.
Make sure the training includes a lot of coaching. Some experts agree that by 
the end of the day of training, many of the memories are gone; interacting with 
a coach may help retention. Make continual connections between the training 
and the individual participant’s jobs. Remember that some well-used networks 
need to be changed, which requires a slower pace and a lot of repetition.
After
These workers need mentoring or coaching as they apply new technology 
to their jobs. Bringing in the younger generations to assist works with some 
employees, but those who feel threatened may not gain any new understanding 
from Gen X or Gen Y coaching. You may want to ask a peer who has learned 
the process to offer support. The thought may be, “If she can do it, so can I!”
If no peers have reached the level of proficiency for coaching, you may want 
to reinforce learning through online tutorials, by calling on peers from other 
departments who could check on the newly trained, or by holding some 
small group meetings with a trainer. In groups, the older generations may feel 
less threatened by a younger coach.

W
hen I speak to employees at most organizations, they say that nearly 
all of their meetings are a huge waste of their time and the company’s 
time. But when they talk about specific meetings, they discover that for the 
most part meetings really do matter. The problem is that the few meetings 
that weren’t worthwhile became memorable because of the bad feelings that 
they brought forth.
Worthwhile meetings usually have two significant qualities: They last for 
short periods of time and they have clear objectives.
If you have one specific target or problem that requires a meeting, making 
it short and getting straight to the point are often appreciated by team 
members if they don’t believe that the problem relates to their job person­
ally. Therefore, sometimes you have to add some short, engaging activities 
to point out how the team is a unit and that every member has a choice to 
make: Am I an insider or an outsider? Everyone in an organization needs to 
understand what others do and how all jobs are interdependent.
In this chapter, you discover how to create meetings that are compatible 
with how the brain works, how to communicate with different types of 
employees, and how to keep your vision in sight at all times.

294
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Why You Should Toss the 
Old Meeting Model
Just the sound of the word meeting can make some employees and leaders 
wince. Everyone has had bad experiences at meetings. In fact, people make 
up all kinds of excuses to miss meetings — just like kids who show up at 
school without their homework. (Anyone on your team have about six dead 
grandmothers?)
Take a survey at your organization, and you’re likely to find some of the fol­
lowing reasons that meetings get such a terrible rap:
	
✓	Meetings never start on time.
	
✓	There was no agenda.
	
✓	The agenda wasn’t followed.
	
✓	It was too long.
	
✓	It was too short — not worth it.
	
✓	A memo (e-mail, text message) would’ve been sufficient.
	
✓	Too much time was wasted talking about unimportant items.
	
✓	People talked during the whole meeting; I couldn’t hear a thing.
	
✓	The room was too hot (cold, warm, dark, bright, crowded . . .).
	
✓	Not enough people were there.
	
✓	Too many people were there.
	
✓	The supervisors weren’t there.
	
✓	Reports were read aloud; I know how to read.
	
✓	The refreshments were stale.
	
✓	There were no refreshments and I was starving.
	
✓	I couldn’t concentrate because cell phones kept ringing.
	
✓	The content had nothing to do with my job.
	
✓	Nothing was accomplished.
	
✓	People could have been making sales instead of wasting time.
And the list goes on and on. The only solution to the problem is to recon­
struct how meetings are held. Some organizations call them non-meetings, but 
that joke gets old. Use your brain and grab the attention of the brains in your 
organization by making your meetings matter.

295
 Chapter 20: Conducting Meetings That Matter
Meeting with the Brain in Mind
For meetings to matter, they have to appeal to those diverse brains in your 
organization. You can’t differentiate a meeting for a lot of different intelli­
gences and personalities, but you can address the universal needs that every 
brain has:
	
✓	The survival brain needs to be calm and open to new information.
	
✓	The emotional brain needs an emotional hook to hold onto the informa­
tion and mark it for memory.
	
✓	The thinking brain needs challenge and choice to appeal to its ability to 
problem solve and make decisions.
The upcoming sections give you ideas for meeting these needs.
Bringing continuity with ritual
Most meetings contain procedures that are followed to keep the agenda 
running smoothly. For example, meetings often begin with a welcome and a 
review of the minutes from the previous meeting. Procedures are established 
methods of getting things done. They are usually done at a specific time or in 
a particular order.
Rituals are acts that provide a sense of security and continuity. Whereas pro­
cedures don’t elicit much feeling, rituals tend to bring forth warm feelings, 
such as a feeling of belonging. Adding rituals to meetings makes them more 
interesting, memorable, and fun.
You can weave rituals into meetings in various ways and make them much 
more pleasurable. The possibilities are endless, but here are some rituals to 
consider for your meetings:
	
✓	Take the first several minutes at each meeting to “unload” and put stress 
on the back burner:
 
• Have participants find a partner.
 
• Give each partner two minutes to share something that may be 
causing tension. (The work they should be doing instead of attend­
ing the meeting, for example, or the projects they need to work on 
after the meeting — maybe a head cold or flu coming on.)
 
• After sharing is complete, ask each person to put concerns on the 
back burner during the meeting because the meeting is going to be 
worthwhile.

296
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
	
✓	Have music playing while people enter the meeting. You might choose a 
theme song for the event. For instance, Queen’s “We Will Rock You” may 
be a great tune for the sales team’s meeting.
	
✓	Address special occasions. Acknowledge a birthday, for example, by 
playing The Beatles’s “Birthday” song and presenting the team member 
a gift — even something as simple as a pencil with the organization’s 
name or logo.
	
✓	Celebrate success. When a goal has been met, have confetti and horns 
to blow, play a sound effect like a drum roll, or have a special treat.
	
✓	Ask for the “story of the week” and allow participants to share interest­
ing or funny incidents that occurred since the last meeting.
	
✓	Use novel ways of getting people interested in the agenda, For example, 
sell the agenda. Like a carny who sells the acts at the carnival, ask par­
ticipants to step right up and participate in the greatest show on earth 
as you hear from the most knowledgeable people in the company . . . .
	
✓	Conclude each meeting in the same way. You might
 
• Ask participants to pair up and review the meeting’s important points.
 
• Ask participants who they feel contributed the most and give that 
person a round of applause.
 
• Play music, like the theme from the movie Rocky.
	
Rituals give meeting participants something to count on. Wouldn’t it be nice 
for your employees to look forward to a meeting because they know it will be 
more than just another meeting, that it will be filled with fun, fanfare, and fri­
volity along with data, discussion, and decisions?
Sharing control
Employees may not get to choose whether they attend a meeting, but you 
can work choice into meetings so that they feel included and have some con­
trol over the meeting. Perhaps the group can discuss which agenda items are 
important and in what order they should be addressed. Sometimes, however, 
not all team members agree, but you can work with a consensus.
As soon as the first employee arrives, the meeting has begun. Rather than 
having early arrivals sit around worrying about what other things they could 
be getting done, offer them a choice of what to do. It can be as simple as get­
ting a refreshment to helping you distribute literature or writing information 
on the whiteboard or flipchart. They get a bit of a heads up on the meeting 
content and get some time to consider how they feel about it. When others 
enter and see their teammate helping, many act as they did in grade school: 
they want to help the teacher, too! Soon everyone is coming early, anticipat­
ing what they can do to be part of the meeting.

297
 Chapter 20: Conducting Meetings That Matter
	
You may add this idea as a ritual to your meetings: “Hit and Miss” is one way to 
attack the agenda as a team. What are the hits — the important or timely items 
you need to talk about? The misses are those items that should not be included 
in this particular meeting. If team members help redesign the agenda through a 
vote, you’re sure to cover the points important to them within the allotted time. 
At problem-solving or decision-making meetings, ask employees to choose 
how they want to attack the issue. Perhaps they want to get into smaller 
groups and discuss the issue on a more detailed level and then bring the 
ideas from each group together. Brainstorming may be a better way to attack 
the subject. Those who have few ideas to contribute initially may feel much 
better and become more knowledgeable through brainstorming.
Soliciting feedback
Exit cards — simple index cards on which the participants answer some 
pertinent questions about the meeting content — are an excellent feedback 
mechanism. (I talk about them also in Chapter 3.) You can use them just as 
easily at the beginning of a meeting. These cards provide valuable informa­
tion that can be scanned quickly and easily if the meeting is not too large. For 
large groups, exit cards may be more useful.
If you use these cards at the beginning of a meeting, you can get an idea of 
each person’s feeling about the agenda you are about to cover. Use them after 
a meeting to find out how much employees understood and get their feedback.
	
After employees have index cards in hand before a meeting, ask them to

Using scorecards to focus on goals
Scorecards can add fun, keep employees focused on goals, and encourage 
participation before, during, and after the meeting. Creating a scorecard is 
a team project. The team, along with the leader, decides which categories 
should be tracked and how, and then creates a scorecard. Table 20-1 shows a 
sample scorecard.

298
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
A scorecard is a self-assessment tool, and so each team rates itself, often on 
a scale from 1 to 10 or by percentage for goals reached. You might want to 
write the team’s goals at the bottom of the chart.

After assessing themselves on the scorecard, team leaders share how the 
team determined the scores, including the percentage of goals reached. Then 
the team decides which category needs to be worked on for the next meeting.
	
While teams are getting their scorecards out and assessing themselves, play 
music such as “Celebration” by Kool and the Gang or “With a Little Help from 
My Friends” by The Beatles. Doing so adds to the fun and celebration.
Getting Your Message Across
In order to get everyone on board, you need to find the best way to express 
your vision, your mission, or your dream. The brain likes stories, emotions, 
pictures, and facts. Using what the brain likes to remember makes getting 
your point across much easier.

299
 Chapter 20: Conducting Meetings That Matter
Offering facts
According to some research, most individuals really like facts. People love 
television shows such as Jeopardy!, and Trivial Pursuit is a popular game for 
people of all ages. Storing trivial information and sports facts is a popular 
hobby. Facts can be impressive to the general public. The public has been 
taught to respect data. 
The facts your employees and all of your stakeholders want are the facts 
about what’s happening in your company. The brain is curious, and espe­
cially in tough economic times, the brain needs to be reassured. When you 
present facts, you meet both of these needs.
For instance, you might say to your employees:
“A very productive business similar to ours in a city nearby had to close 
its doors because of high overhead.”
That statement doesn’t have the impact of the following:
“Lancaster’s in Bloomington had to close down because the overhead 
was up 45 percent over last year.”
Details make the second statement more memorable.
Adding emotion
Adding emotion gives the story a more personal feeling. A store closing is 
sad, even when a competitor is closing. In troubled times, no leader wants 
to see another business fold. When times are good, they are often good for 
everyone.
To make the story even more memorable, make it more personal:
“Thirty-three employees are out of work in Bloomington because 
Lancaster’s went under. That’s right, they closed their doors on 
Wednesday without even telling anyone, including their employees. 
When Bob Larson, the former president of the company was finally 
reached, he broke down as he shared with me, ‘I couldn’t pay the bills. 
Our overhead was one of the main problems. We should have cut back 
last year; it’s not like we didn’t all see this coming. We were so far behind. 
I haven’t taken a paycheck in four weeks. I can’t even pay any severance 
to the great people who worked for me. I’m off to see an attorney about 
bankruptcy right now.’ So, I’m just telling all of you right now, this could 
mean more business for us, or it could be some handwriting on the wall. 

300
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
We have to keep costs down if we want to make it in this economy. Turn 
off the lights when you leave a room. Don’t make unnecessary road trips 
at the expense of the company. Meet your customers for coffee instead of 
lunch. Let’s see if we can make it through this economic downturn.”
The story calls up surprise, sadness, and fear — strong emotions that imprint 
a sturdy memory in the brain. Those employees are going to remember what 
their leader told them.
	
Humor is also a wonderful way to convey a message. When you express yourself 
using humor, you relieve stress in your audience. Their smiles cause the release 
of dopamine as a reward, and they look forward to what you have to say.
Creating connections with symbols
If I tell you I had a really bad day and give you no further information, your 
brain creates a mental picture of what you think that bad day was like. 
Perhaps you see me stranded at the airport, having a flat tire, or losing my 
credit card. If I don’t give you the picture, you create your own.
So it goes with sharing your vision or your mission. Making certain that 
your language is as symbolic as it is emotional and factual makes your 
message more compelling. Concrete symbols create an instant connection 
between giver and receiver. Such is the case with the pink ribbon symbol 
for the Komen Foundation and its fight against breast cancer. Avon and Dr. 
Susan Love have their Army of Women who are going to beat breast cancer. 
Symbols and symbolic language are both shortcuts to the message.
Your symbol may be your logo, an anecdote, a metaphor, a song or a story. 
Make your symbol or symbolic language a shortcut to a message. The pre­
vious story about the closing of Lancasters becomes a symbol for your 
company. Whenever teams are thinking about spending money, the ritual 
statement is always made, “Remember Lancasters.” This puts spending into 
perspective: can the expenditure really help the company?
Leaders use their company symbols to keep the vision in sight. The logo is on 
the wall, the stationery, the uniforms, and the trucks. When the leader speaks 
using facts and emotions, the symbol is present. She shares it, shows it, and 
conveys it through her message.

 Chapter 20: Conducting Meetings That Matter
Symbolic language in action: 
“I’m so glad you got to meet me”
My father, Lee Broms, dropped out of high 
school to get a job and make a living. It was 
1939 and he wanted a trade. Dad went to work 
for a furrier. He learned to cut skins and sew 
them together to look like the wonderful coats 
and stoles he had designed. The fur business 
was a good business in those days. When Dad 
started working for Jack, he was promised “a 
piece of the business” one day. And that was 
his dream. To own and run his own business. 
Time passed. Dad married Mom and had two 
little girls. That “one day” in which Dad would 
own part of the business never seemed to 
come. When Dad would ask, Jack would say, 
“Business just isn’t that good right now, Lee. 
But soon. Very soon.” Dad waited. 
When Mom became pregnant for the third time 
(that would be me), Dad asked Jack one more 
time to fulfill his promise. Jack said no and 
Dad knew he had to start looking around. By 
this time the fur salons were showing up in the 
nicer department stores. Not having monster.
com or any other fast form of communication, 
job opportunities usually came through friends, 
relatives, and people in the business. 
With Mom getting closer and closer to her due 
date, Dad packed up the family and left the only 
town he knew, Minneapolis, and headed down 
to Peoria, Illinois, where Bergner’s department 
store was opening up a fur department. Dad 
walked in to apply for the job. Several others 
waited to be interviewed, so Dad knew he had 
to be memorable.
The interview went very well — after all, Dad 
had a lot of experience. But how could he be 
remembered? When the interview was about to 
conclude, Dad, who always had a great sense 
of humor, shook the interviewer’s hand and 
said, “I just want you to know that no matter 
who you hire, I’m glad you got to meet me!”
He left the man speechless. Later that night, 
Dad got a phone call. “Mr. Broms,” the inter­
viewer said, “of all the people I interviewed for 
this job, as I sat down to consider each person 
you kept popping into my head. I couldn’t get 
that last line out of my mind. How soon can you 
start?”
That would end the story, except that line 
became a staple for the salespeople in Dad’s 
department. When a customer left, whether 
she bought a fur or not, the salesperson always 
said, “I’m glad you got to meet me.” A smile and 
sometimes a wink (politically correct in those 
days) accompanied the “line.” It became the 
symbolic language of the department. People 
thought it amusing, and more importantly, 
they thought about their experience in that fur 
department. 
It sent a message not only to the customers but 
also to every person working in the department 
and eventually in the entire store. They wanted 
every single customer to know that their job 
was to make each experience pleasant enough 
to end with that somewhat cocky statement. 
And most people responded back, “I’m glad I 
got to meet you, too!”

Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Keeping the Conversations Going
Meetings end, but the work keeps going. You need to remind your team about 
the discussion, the decisions, and the camaraderie. You have a lot of options 
for communicating with employees, and how you choose to do so has a lot to 
do with the needs and styles of the people who work with you. The upcoming 
sections outline some of the methods for getting out your message.
Updating employees with 
a memo or newsletter
A newsletter or memo (printed or sent by e-mail) can be an effective vehicle 
for keeping up the team spirit. You may use such a communication for 
reporting meeting minutes, or you may want to produce a lively newsletter 
complete with team accomplishments and upcoming celebrations, holidays, 
or other events. The upcoming list gives you ideas for items you might want 
to include:
	
✓	Tips or suggestions for carrying out tasks discussed at the meeting
	
✓	An agenda for the next meeting
	
✓	Updates about how specific projects are going
	
✓	Personal information that may interest meeting participants (birthdays, 
accolades, and so on)
	
✓	Current goals and how they’re being met
Putting together a newsletter can be time-consuming, but you can keep it 
simple and get your point across.
Sending your message electronically
After a meeting, you can send an e-mail or text message or write a blog entry 
that employees can access within minutes to reinforce meeting information, 
give reminders, or even make a few corrections.
	
Keeping Gen X and Gen Y workers in on the team conversation often involves 
more high-tech communication. Some may think that the newsletter sent via 
e-mail is okay but certainly low-tech. 

303
 Chapter 20: Conducting Meetings That Matter
Options for communicating electronically include
	
✓	Text messages: Sent via your cell phone, a text message enables you 
to contact individuals quickly, especially if they need a reminder to do 
a specific job that must get done quickly or if you have a correction to 
make specifically for one person.
	
✓	Blogs: A blog is basically an active online journal. A leader may post 
pertinent company information on his blog, which is available for all 
employees to read, and employees can read and respond to it.
	
✓	Facebook pages: Facebook is a social networking tool similar to a blog, 
but only those whom you designate can access your Facebook page and 
comment on what you write. This communication tool provides interac­
tion among users.
	
✓	Intranet: A private computer network, such as Google Sites or Microsoft 
Share Points enables you and your employees to create personal sites 
with information, pictures, videos, and goals. You can communicate 
with employees, sharing announcements, data, newsletters, and gather­
ing feedback through surveys. Your team can also create a site for the 
project or goal that it’s working on. You can control who has access to 
your site and use it to interact with other businesses, as well.
	
✓	Twitter: This short blog enables you to let others know what you are 
doing at any given time. It is limited to 140 characters, so you can’t give 
much information in one tweet (message on Twitter). When you sign 
up for Twitter, you can decide whether to restrict who can read your 
tweets. Once you are signed up, others can search for you and ask to 
follow you (the term for communicating with others on Twitter). Your 
team can sign up and exclusively tweet each other.
Supporting Employees through 
Personal Meetings
Employees want the opportunity to be listened to and understood. The brain 
reacts to this interaction by releasing neurotransmitters that help with focus, 
attention, and memory. These chemicals also make a person feel happy. 
Happy employees are more motivated and productive. So think of personal, 
one-on-one meetings as a real opportunity to help your employees do their 
best work for you and for the company. These personal meetings also create 
relationships and bonds based on unspoken or spoken promises. Leaders 
promise leadership, resources, opportunity, security, compensation, and a 
future. Employees promise their loyalty, talents, and skills.

304
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
Sharing your vision; living your vision
Five years from now . . . what? As a leader you have created a picture in your 
mind of what your organization will look like in the future. It is so vivid, that 
when you speak of it, you assume that others see it. But your job is to make 
undeniably certain that your employees see and feel your vision. The pas­
sion that you must share is a contagious emotion that can spread throughout 
your company with your assistance, persistence, and insistence!
Your senior leadership team should be living your vision on a daily basis. Their 
behaviors and actions should radiate and reinforce what that vision means. 
The key is alignment. Can you align your vision with the personal dreams and 
goals of your employees? Can you convince them that you are all here for the 
same reason? If you can do that, you have a dream you can share.
Begin each personal meeting with your vision statement, “Five years from 
now our company will be . . . .” The key word here is our. Make your employ­
ees feel that they are part of something big. And then talk about how this 
employee will contribute to this vision.
	
Each and every time you share your vision, you help your employees store it in 
their brains. When your employees are asked about their work, that vision is 
easily accessible and can become part of the conversation. And every time a 
memory is retrieved, the easier it is to remember again and the faster it comes to 
mind in various situations.
The Chief Effervescent Officer
Charlie Cowell is the CEO of a pharmaceuticals 
company in the southeast. Charlie lets every­
one know that his job is not Chief Executive 
Officer; he is Chief Effervescent Officer. Charlie 
bubbles over with excitement about his job, his 
vision, and his mission. Whenever he speaks to 
anyone in the building, his bubbling personality 
and his passion about Cowell Pharmaceuticals 
spills over the conversations. 
Ask Charlie what his job description is, and you 
will find it unique among other leaders. Charlie’s 
job is to “make the fizzy feasible for everyone.” 
He conjures up in the minds of his employees, 
customers, and other stakeholders “fizzy liquid 
solutions” (a vision of his pharmaceuticals) 
that make their way into homes and hospitals 
to make people feel better. Charlie loves his 
employees, and when he meets with them — 
whether in individual or company wide meet­
ings — you can bet he’s offering a sparkling 
solution as a refreshment. Charlie holds up a 
glass and toast his workers because they are 
making a difference in people’s lives.
Are the drugs he makes fizzy, you might ask? 
No. But fizzy is as fizzy does, Charlie says. If 
everyone in his employ would effervesce, they 
would have high spirits and be animated. That’s 
how Charlie is, and his high spirits have spread 
throughout the company. Everyone who leaves 
a meeting with Charlie is a bit happier and a big 
believer in his solutions.

 Chapter 20: Conducting Meetings That Matter
No leader did a better job in sharing his vision than Walt Disney. When he pre­
pared to make his first animated film, many people thought he was crazy. But 
he went as far as acting out the entire movie for his animation staff. He wanted 
them to see what he saw, a quality full-length animated film that would keep 
the audience’s attention. And he was relentless. He made his team work hard 
and cut much of their other work to keep them focused on the goal. Because 
he made them feel that this was an opportunity to hone and to share their tal­
ents, they stayed with him and created a box-office success.
Showing the whole picture
Because of the way the brain works, it is easy to leave out certain information 
when you are explaining something that has been stored and rehearsed many 
times. You assume that the person you’re speaking with sees what you see 
and understands what you understand. As a result, you likely assume that 
your message is clear and complete even when it isn’t.
Even worse, of course, is not sharing the vision with the team and the indi­
viduals who make up that team. This is one reason personal meetings are 
so important. The second is the possibility of building really strong relation­
ships with your employees, much like Walt Disney did.
Giving the whole picture may require the following in group meetings:
	
✓	Many repetitions: Even though the information is in your long-term 
memory, it’s not in theirs.
	
✓	Visuals: Add a picture, chart, or any visual that represents what you 
want them to see.
	
✓	Emotion: Your passion goes a long way.
	
✓	Stories: A story or metaphor may help them see what you see.
Find out in personal meetings whether your employees can share the com­
pany vision with you. Ask them to write it down for you or to create a visual 
to help others. All of these suggestions can tell you whether you’re clearly 
communicating your vision. Walt Disney’s employees were drawing his 
vision, and so he knew that they were seeing what he saw. You may not have 
that same opportunity, but if you want everyone to be able to spread the 
word and get it right, you have to check for any misconceptions.
Building better relationships
Whether you’re meeting with employees, customers, or other stakeholders, 
keep in mind that your optimism is contagious. The more positively you speak 
as you share your vision and their participation in that vision, the more likely 

306
Part IV: Training and Developing Brains 
you are to receive positive responses. People who get to know each other on a 
personal basis accomplish more tasks and solve more problems.
Every meeting is an opportunity to create relationships that keep your 
employees aligned with your vision. Most meetings are conducted in a very 
procedural manner. This does save time, and you can quickly go through an 
agenda and check things off as completed. When you meet with individuals, 
the shape of the meetings is very different. 
When you work on these personal relationships, you build trust. Take the 
risk of exposing a little of your personality, and be willing to accept feedback. 
Meet with employees on equal ground. This can be anywhere from meeting 
them on the plant floor to taking a walk or going to a restaurant. Thank your 
employee for her contribution to the vision and show her again how it fits 
into the big picture. Let her know what your expectations are and how much 
you appreciate the manner in which she is meeting (or getting close to meet­
ing, or exceeding) those expectations.
When the meeting is over, keep the relationship going. Send a thank-you note 
and say you are looking forward to future meetings. Thank him again for his 
contribution.
Meeting employees in the middle
Ben is given the lead position at a Southwest 
assembly plant for a modular home manufac­
turer. When he takes over the plant, the end 
product is of poor quality, and morale among 
employees is low. There is also a large turn­
over in help. A company meeting is called to 
introduce Ben to the work force. Ben walks 
in front of the group wearing a work uniform 
and his carpenter tool belt. He starts off with 
a story about a young family buying their first 
new house, which was built by their plant. He 
explains that this family is much like the fami­
lies of the people working in this plant. He then 
tells them all of the problems that the poor 
quality issues caused this family and asks them 
all to think about how they would feel if this 
happened to their own families. Ben tells his 
co-workers that with their help he is going to 
change the assembly plant to a “home creation 
center” so that young families can buy homes 
in which they live happily ever after. 
Ben starts by holding meetings with each team 
and having them list the problems they are 
having. Ben helps them pick the three highest 
priority problems. Even if Ben already has the 
solution, he asks the team for ways to solve 
the problems. Most of the time the teams come 
up with the best solutions, but when they don’t 
they’re more willing to use Ben’s suggestion 
because they’ve had the opportunity to provide 
input. When problems arise, Ben meets with 
the team involved and addresses the problem 
in an unthreatening way. Ben always empha­
sizes that he isn’t interested in reprimanding 
the person who caused the problem; he is inter­
ested in adjusting the procedure to eliminate 
the problem. Ben has the teams keep a self-
assessment scorecard of new and old prob­
lems so that they can see how they are doing. 
In less than a year, Ben eliminates the quality 
issues and brings up the company’s morale.

T
he chapters in this part give you quick bits of informa­
tion that you can easily put to use. I give you the truths 
behind ten common myths about the brain, tell you ten 
ways to incorporate neuroscience into your leadership 
practices, and ten strategies for keeping your brain in 
tip-top shape.

Debunking Ten Brain Myths
In This Chapter
▶	Finding the facts behind the rumors
▶	Discovering more about how the brain really works
▶	Laying to rest mistaken ideas about the brain
T
he brain is full of mystery. Even today, a lot remains unknown about the 
inner workings of this 3-pound organ. And with mystery comes myth. It’s 
natural for the brain to make up stuff about itself as it tries to figure itself out — 
snippets of information cause people to wonder, and because the brain tries 
to make sense out of things, the snippets become stories and the stories 
become legends.
In this chapter I share ten persistent myths about the brain and the truth as 
it is known today.
You Use Only 10 Percent of Your Brain
People argue about whether you use even 10 percent of your brain. On some 
days, you might feel like your brain isn’t working at all. But the fact of the 
matter is, you use all of your brain! If that makes you feel dumb, don’t let it.
Your brain really is a use-it-or-lose-it organ. Those little nerve fibers I talk 
about in Chapter 2 either bloom as you learn new things and use that learn­
ing, or they are pruned away if you don’t use them.
But your entire brain contains electrical and chemical activity at all times. 
Even when you sleep. Granted, sometimes the electrical and chemical activ­
ity is quite low in areas that aren’t being actively used, but from moment to 
moment those areas are ready to fire up if needed.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You Are Either Left-Brained 
or Right-Brained
This myth feels like it should be addressed by my left brain, because that is 
where you would find my logic. Years ago, when researchers discovered that 
the brain hemispheres have separate functions, some unknowing people took 
that information and decided that you use only one of your hemispheres. That 
notion isn’t logical. Worse, the idea that more women are right-brained and 
men left-brained got appended to the myth.
This myth is really a no-brainer. Everyone uses both hemispheres of their 
brains as long as they have both hemispheres. (There have been cases in which 
a hemisphere has been surgically removed for medical reasons. If that happens 
at an early age, the remaining hemisphere takes over the functions of both.)
Your left hemisphere controls the right side of your body and the right hemi­
sphere controls the left side of your body. If you used only one hemisphere, 
you would have physical difficulties with one side. More proof that this is 
a myth.
Drinking Alcohol Kills Brain Cells
First things first: There is little doubt that alcoholics hurt their brains and 
may cause permanent damage.
You probably have heard the “alcohol kills brain cells” myth several ways. 
My favorite is, “Every time you have a drink, you kill 50,000 brain cells.” But 
the myth can be even scarier: for every ounce of alcohol you drink, you lose 
one million brain cells!
I personally like the buffalo theory as hypothesized by the character, Cliff, on 
the TV series Cheers. His story is that just like in a buffalo herd, the slowest 
runners are the ones who get killed, slow brain cells are the ones that die off 
from alcohol. According to Cliff (who always hangs out at the bar), drinking 
kills off weak brain cells, and so when you drink you feel smarter!
The fact is, you do lose some brain cells every day. And “You may as well 
have a good time doing it,” as educator and researcher Dr. David Sousa said 
at a conference on the brain. But alcohol doesn’t kill brain cells. Excessive 
drinking may damage parts of cells, but moderate drinking isn’t a problem.

311
 Chapter 21: Debunking Ten Brain Myths
Adults Don’t Grow New Brain Cells
For decades, scientists believed that you were born with one hundred billion 
brain cells and lost some throughout your life but never got any new ones. 
In 1992, I was telling people that as a fact. But research proved it wrong.
Neurogenesis is the word used to describe the growth of new cells in the 
brain. New cells are produced in such structures as the hippocampus, 
which is responsible for assisting in the storage of long-term memories. The 
research that cinched this was performed by injecting a dye into cancer 
patients. The dye would attach itself only to new cells. Autopsies of these 
patients revealed that they indeed had grown new brain cells.
You can get new cells from learning something new, exercising, and eating nutri­
tious foods. Stress, on the other hand, can prevent the birth of new neurons.
There Is No Difference Between 
Male and Female Brains
This ongoing argument about male and female differences should be coming 
to an end with the latest research proving that males and females use different 
parts of their brains for various functions.
The facts are clear when you look at statistics rather than at individuals. Females 
tend to remember details, especially in connection with more emotional 
memories, and so they use their left hemisphere (which remembers facts) 
more than males. Males tend to remember the big picture, and they call on 
their right hemispheres to do so.
Typically, females handle emotion differently and remember emotional 
events quickly and intensely; the emotional center of the brain, the amygdala, 
is larger in men than in women.
Males have more gray matter; females more white matter. As a result of these 
typical differences, males and females working together complement each 
other. Males work in a more localized area of the brain, which is helpful for 
things like computation. The white matter in females enables faster interaction 
between widespread areas of the brain like those for speech and reading body 
language.
Most studies suggest that the band of fibers connecting the two hemispheres 
is larger in females than in males, which may be why females tend to do many 
things at one time while males tend to do only one thing at a time.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
IQ Is Fixed
The more you understand about the brain, the more you realize that a person’s 
IQ staying the same throughout her life has to be a myth. Recent research 
has proven that the brain can change at any age. Increasing intelligence 
throughout your life is possible and likely.
Genetics doesn’t play as big a part in determining intelligence as researchers 
once thought. Environment and experience are bigger factors than genetics 
in determining intelligence, but nature and nurture work together.
In short: If you keep trying new things, you improve your intelligence.
Subliminal Messages Work
Years ago a study was done in which pictures of Coke and popcorn, and the 
words “Drink Coke” were flashed intermittently on the screen in a movie the­
ater. These “messages” appeared too briefly for viewers to notice them. They 
were meant to reach the unconscious mind and make moviegoers go to the 
concession stand and buy Coke and popcorn. The study was done by a man 
named James Vicary, who claimed that sales of Coke went up about 20 
percent and popcorn sales over 50 percent. 
The study caused advertisers to consider using these messages for their 
products. Books were written about how to use subliminal messages in 
advertising. But a few years later, Vicary admitted to lying about the study. 
Further studies produced no difference in sales using subliminal messages.
Brain Damage Is Always Permanent
The neuroplasticity of the brain serves two purposes: One is to make new 
connections for learning and memory and the other is to rewire to help repair 
brain injury. There have been many heartfelt stories told of the ability to 
reconnect brain pathways to overcome damage from accidents, strokes, and 
brain disease.
The older the brain is, the slower it can repair itself, but the possibility of 
forming new pathways after a stroke that affects the language centers, for 
example, is good. It requires therapy and much repetition, but many people 
respond well after brain injury.

 Chapter 21: Debunking Ten Brain Myths
The Brain Gets New Wrinkles 
When You Learn Something
You’re born with as many wrinkles as you are going to get — at least, in your 
brain.
Shortly after conception the brain begins to grow. It starts out very smooth, 
and by the time a baby is born, her brain is wrinkled — just as much as an 
adult’s. The wrinkles are a result of the brain growing. Neurons are produced 
and migrate to different brain areas. They also grow dendrites and axons that 
make the brain larger. The brain just wouldn’t fit into our skulls if it weren’t 
folded. If you unfolded the top layer of your brain, the folded part, it would 
be about the size of a large dinner napkin! The birth canal isn’t large enough 
for a brain that size!
Your brain does change when you learn something, but not by adding wrinkles. 
New neurons develop, dendrites sprout, and axons grow. It’s a wonderful 
process.
Your Memory Worsens As You Age
You simply are not doomed to fading memory as you age. Because the brain 
continues to change as you learn new things, you form new memories. If you 
activate your old memories by reminiscing, talking to old friends, and looking 
at pictures, you can keep those old memories active, as well. Hanging around 
with interesting people and trying new things improves your cognitive abilities 
and adds new memories, too.
The more active you remain, the more likely your memory is to stay strong. 
Exercise increases blood flow and oxygen to your brain. The more sedentary 
you are, the more likely you are to experience memory deficits.
Good nutrition also keeps memory strong because it provides the brain with 
what it needs to produce the chemicals to help you store memories. Sleep 
also helps: The brain stores information at night while you sleep.

Ten Tips for Brain-Based 
Leadership 
In This Chapter
▶	Maximizing leadership potential
▶	Serving as a great example
▶	Harnessing decision-making skills
T
hroughout this book I talk about how understanding the brain and applying 
brain research help you become a better leader. In this chapter, I offer 
ten tips to keep you using your head as you lead.
Hire Leaders
When you’re surrounded by others with leadership qualities, you receive 
better advice and better decision-making strategies, and you can take your 
business where you want to go in a shorter period of time. 
As a leader you need to
	
✓	Hire those who you feel have leadership abilities — those who listen 
well, are good communicators, are highly motivated, and know and 
share your values.
	
✓	Maximize leadership opportunities among your senior leadership team.
	
✓	Step back and let your leaders do what they do best. When you have 
employees who you feel are ready to lead, take a back seat and give 
them the opportunity to use their skills.

Maximize Digital Wisdom
Keep your organization technologically up to date by balancing the digital 
immigrants (those to whom digital technology is new) in your workforce with 
digital natives (those who grew up with digital technology). Take advantage 
of those tech-savvy employees who can teach others, including yourself.
The brain is changing as a result of the number of hours people spend working 
with digital gadgets. Learn how these brains are working, what their needs are, 
and how you can better lead both those who are very well acquainted with and 
rely on technology and those who need to learn more about it.
Bring People with You
Share your values, ideals, and vision with your followers. Use your passion 
and your influence to get others to believe in you. You do this by
	
✓	Acknowledging their value to the organization
	
✓	Recognizing and utilizing their strengths
	
✓	Praising their accomplishments
	
✓	Keeping them focused on the goals
Lead by Example
Mirror neurons ensure that whatever behaviors you model for your employ­
ees are recreated in their brains. In other words, when someone watches 
how you treat a customer, the same connections your brain makes as you 
actively interact are being made in the brains of those who observe you. 
Make sure that you
	
✓	Model how customers should be treated.
	
✓	Model how goals should be pursued.
	
✓	Just as Alexander the Great always led his soldiers into battle, make 
yourself visible to your workforce.
	
✓	Be optimistic and positive. Emotions are contagious.

 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Brain-Based Leadership
Handle Conflict
Many leaders don’t like conflict. Some ignore it and hope it goes away on its 
own. If you don’t address conflict, employees lose their confidence in you. The 
good news is that you can take steps to handle conflict. Try the following:
	
✓	Ask questions to clarify the problem.
	
✓	Listen carefully to both sides.
	
✓	Resist taking sides.
	
✓	Find a way for the conflicting employees or teams to come to an agree­
ment; lead them toward compromise.
	
✓	If compromise is unlikely, bring in a negotiator.
	
✓	Try for a win-win solution.
	
Conflict can slow productivity and cause negativity to permeate the work­
place. Try to create a climate of openness and trust so that employees are 
more likely to air their differences and find a solution.
Resist the Urge to Micromanage
You hired your employees because you knew they would be a great fit. They 
know their jobs. You can relax! If you second-guess employees, you squelch 
their motivation. Give them the chance to do what you hired them to do.
Be there for them. Ask whether you can help. But assume that you knew what 
you were doing when you hired them!
Value Emotional Intelligence
Pay attention to how employees interact with you and others. Knowing how 
to communicate with and read others has nothing to do with attending the 
best schools or getting the best grades. In fact, many of those valedictorians 
you went to school with aren’t successful because they have academic skills 
but not people skills.
	
Model your own emotional intelligence skills when you work with others and 
when you talk to them. If your work environment is filled with people using 
social skills, those few who lack them can learn through observation. If your 
workplace lacks models of emotional intelligence, institute training in 
these skills.

318

Give the Credit; Take the Cash
Many employees complain because they feel they haven’t received credit for 
their work. They think their superiors are taking their ideas and their hard 
work to make themselves look good. This behavior may cause a heck of a lot of 
hard feelings. Give employees the credit. Let them feel good about themselves 
and the contributions they’re making toward your goals. 
The good news is that their hard work is making your business successful 
and improving your bottom line. Take the cash! Give employees the credit!
Provide Feedback
Feedback does two things: it gives your employees the opportunity to change 
the way they work so that they do a better job, and it raises the ability of 
your entire organization to be more successful. Every single person who 
improves his performance brings you closer to reaching your goals.
	
When you provide feedback make sure that you
	
✓	Make it specific. Cheerleading is not a bad thing, but specific feedback 
gives employees data that they can work with to improve.
	
✓	Suggest improvements. Positive feedback is easier to give, but you don’t 
want your employees to become complacent. Mention an area where 
they could improve, so that they have something to work on.
	
✓	Connect feedback to the employee’s job performance, and show the 
effect their performance has on the organization.
Seek feedback from your employees. If you listen to what they think you 
could improve upon, they’re more likely to act upon your feedback.
When You Can’t Decide, Run for It!
I hate those days when I can’t make a decision or make a decision and then 
immediately change my mind. Indecision may have something to do with a lack 
of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which works in the executive center of your 
brain and helps eliminate other options after you have made a decision. 
Movement is one quick way of getting a dopamine fix. If you can’t make up 
your mind, get some exercise. A brisk walk or a run should jog your mind enough 
to help you decide. Another plus to exercise is that it helps rid your body and 
brain of stress chemicals that may also hinder your decision-making.

Chapter 23
Ten Ways to Build a Better Brain
In This Chapter
▶	Taking care of yourself
▶	Challenging your brain
A
s a leader who’s eager to make a difference, you want to do all you can 
for your brain. The ten tips in this chapter get you started on a brain-
healthy life.
Eat Nutritiously 
If you really want high levels of cognition and the ability to learn new informa­
tion more easily, begin with your diet. Your brain is about 78 percent water. 
Keep it hydrated for optimal performance. Make sure that you eat fresh fruit, 
nuts, vegetables high in antioxidants — the dark green, leafy kind — lean 
protein, complex carbohydrates, and good fats like omega-3 fatty acids in 
salmon, sardines, and tuna. 
	
Your body turns food into the glucose that feeds your brain. Your brain can’t 
store energy, so eating often is a good idea.
Balancing your diet should get you most of what you need, but talk to your 
doctor if you’re considering supplements like a multi-vitamin or fish oil capsules.
Move It or Lose It
According to the research of Dr. John Medina, author of Brain Rules and 
director of the Brain Center for Applied Learning Research at Seattle Pacific 
University, exercise can increase your cognitive abilities in a matter of weeks. 
Aerobic exercise only twice a week for about 30 minutes increases blood flow 
and provides more oxygen to the brain — all of which means that new blood 
vessels are formed and old ones are renewed, keeping your brain cells healthy.

320

Exercise also gets rid of stress chemicals that have built up in your brain. 
Those chemicals can interfere with learning and memory. More exciting news 
is that exercise over time can decrease your risk of Alzheimer’s disease by up 
to 50 percent.
The more exercise you do, the more the brain releases a chemical called 
brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which basically fertilizes your brain 
and helps neurons grow. Exercise also affects specific areas that help with 
learning and memory.
Rest 
When you sleep, your brain is awake. Brain science believes that you learn 
while you sleep. Your brain repeats the connections that it made during the 
day as it was learning and having other experiences. The process is called 
consolidation, and interruptions to your sleep at specific times affect what 
you remember. 
	
Get about eight hours of sleep and see whether you feel better, think better, 
and remember more.
Naps also increase performance. At about 3 p.m., most people really want to 
sleep. This is a great time for you and your employees to take a snooze. The 
nap can increase performance and attention!
Relax 
A little bit of stress increases your memory, but a little bit more and you 
could be in trouble. According to some researchers, the stress hormones, 
such as cortisol, can actually disconnect a network of neurons in your brain. 
When that happens, you begin a thought and you can’t remember how to 
finish it or start to do something and forget what it was.
	
To keep your stress low, try the following:
	
✓	Avoid stressful situations whenever possible.
	
✓	Exercise to rid yourself of built-up stress hormones.
	
✓	Seek treatment if you think you have depression.
Stress costs businesses money every year. If a great deal is expected of you 
at work, you need to feel in control. Knowing that you have the skills and the 
tools to do your work gives you this control.

 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Build a Better Brain
Keep Your Memory in Shape
Put away your smart phone, your personal digital assistant, and your com­
puter for a little while. Do you know the phone numbers of your friends, col­
leagues, or family members without having to look them up? If you want to 
improve your memory and your brain, you have to use it.
Memorize something. If you don’t like memorizing numbers, try a poem 
or some funny stories. Are you the type of person who wishes you could 
remember jokes after you hear them? Go out of your way to memorize some 
jokes. These are great workouts for your working memory. 
Over time you forget memory strategies; giving your memory a workout can 
give you the opportunity to reacquaint yourself with some of them. Keep 
working it!
Pick Up a Book
Have you read a good book lately? Reading is good for your brain. It also 
increases your vocabulary. Read something — fiction, nonfiction, poetry, 
whatever! — and then talk about it to someone. Better yet, join a book club, 
or start one yourself.
Reading helps you build new connections in your brain and may even cause 
new neurons to develop. It also gives you something to talk to people about. 
Building relationships is about finding common ground. A book might just be 
the perfect connection between you and someone you work with.
Be Upbeat
What makes you happy? Make a list and take a long look at it. Make sure you 
find time to do those things that truly make you feel good. Optimism in a 
leader builds confidence in employees and customers.
If you’ve always been a pessimist, find a book on optimism or on happiness. 
Read about how to change some of that thinking. You can train your brain to 
be more optimistic. Some research says that your brain is built for optimism. 
Take advantage of those natural tendencies to consider the future bright. 
Optimists know they have good brains, and they work to maintain them.

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Make a Few Changes
Now is the time to break some of your routines. Try a new route to work or a 
new hobby. Breaking your routine causes you to be more aware of how your 
mind is working. If you’ve always wanted to learn to speak French, there’s no 
time like the present. Get those neurotransmitters flowing.
So much of life is spent on autopilot that you may forget to take time to smell 
the roses. The brain likes novelty. Give it something new to think about, and 
you make some new connections.
Name That Tune
The brain likes music, and learning how to play a musical instrument excites 
your brain. Playing music activates several areas of the brain and so gets blood 
and oxygen flowing in various structures, making an overall healthier brain.
What about your old musical instrument? Is there an untuned piano in the 
basement or a guitar that could use some new strings in the back of the 
closet? If you don’t play an instrument, at least play “Name That Tune.” 
Someone hums the first few notes of a song and you try to guess the title. 
That can wake up a few sleepy cells!
Teach Someone Else
Research has suggested for years that teaching others is the number-one way 
to learn information yourself. Think about something you’re good at and you 
haven’t had much time for. Perhaps the chess board is missing a piece and 
you haven’t picked up the game in years. 
Replace that pawn and find someone who is interested in learning. You’ll 
renew the chess patterns you previously stored, help someone else, and 
probably have a good time as well! 
	
Teaching reinforces old connections, strengthens new connections, and 
strengthens social skills, too.
