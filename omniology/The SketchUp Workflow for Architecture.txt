The  
SketchUp  
Workflow  
for Architecture


Starting the Flow
Get ready to elevate your SketchUp skills and design workflow to 
the highest radical extremes of efficiency. The SketchUp Workflow 
for Architecture contains tips, tricks, and strategies for modeling in 
SketchUp, as well as methods to leverage SketchUp and LayOut during 
every step of the design process. Let’s start with a few tips on how to 
get the most out of this book, how BIM plays a part in the SketchUp 
workflow, and how to effectively manage a PROJECT folder.
P A R T  I


Chapter 1
Introduction
T
his book is the missing set of standards for SketchUp and LayOut. 
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture provides a flexible, clear 
set of rules for organizing any type of building project in SketchUp: 
renovation, new construction, residential, commercial, high-rise, low-rise, 
industrial. It is up to the user to process these techniques and strategies, 
and then apply them to projects. In this chapter you will pick up a few tips 
on how to best absorb the information and get the most out of this book.
This book covers advanced concepts performed with advanced operations. These are not 
workarounds; rather they are clever ways to use SketchUp to expedite the design process. 
With The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture and some practice, you will be able to:
☑
☑Speak knowledgeably about Building Information Modeling (BIM).
☑
☑Organize and manage PROJECT folders in an efficient manner.
☑
☑Effectively use the Modeling tools and organization containers in SketchUp.
☑
☑Create and customize a timesaving SketchUp template.
☑
☑Tailor the SketchUp modeling environment to fit your professional needs.
☑
☑Create and organize collections for materials, components, styles, and templates.
☑
☑Find, install, and utilize valuable ruby scripts.
☑
☑Fully understand the value of LayOut and its dynamic links to SketchUp and other 
insertable content.

The Workflow
The term “workflow” loosely describes the collection of tools designers use and the order in 
which they use those tools to produce a final design. Designers use many different tools and 
software to produce their final products, which are typically new, built environments; some 
of many initial products are construction documents. 
Many different workflows can be used to design and create construction documents; 
however, the best workflows minimize the use of several different softwares because some-
thing is always lost during translation between programs. 
The workflow explained in this book uses SketchUp and LayOut for every phase of the 
design process. You can use other programs to supplement SketchUp, but SketchUp Pro and 
LayOut are at the core of this process. For example, you could use an image editor to post-­
process exports and modify textures, but you will simply be using the image editor to com-
plement SketchUp. As another example, you could use a spreadsheet program for schedules, 
but keep all of your drafting in SketchUp and LayOut. 
This workflow is not a regimented design process; you can adapt all or part of it and use 
the organizational and design tips. The process of moving from sketches to construction 
documents is expedited by The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture (Figure 1.1).

Chapter 1: Introduction
Figure 1.1  The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
The evolution of a client’s vision to an actual building involves many small steps and 
phases. There is no right or wrong way to produce a design, but there are critics out there 
who will judge your designs. The most important audiences, however, are your clients. The 
more time you spend on the design, the better. The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture is 
focused on design and will ultimately provide more time for you to explore real designs in 
three dimensions.
Who Should Read This Book?
Anyone interested in mastering SketchUp will benefit greatly from this book—
architects, landscape architects, designers, interior designers, contractors.  Large firms, 
one-man-shows, and every office size in between can benefit from this book. If you 
are using SketchUp to design built space, you should practice The SketchUp Workflow 
for Architecture. Most sizable firms already have a design workflow with 3D Building 
Information Modeling (BIM) software and standards in place. BIM is excellent for huge 
projects with extensive scheduling and square footage, but does it really help on the 

6
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
smaller projects? For large firms, The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture will fit in where 
a bloated, over-featured software suite is not necessary. The techniques in this book give 
you the freedom to simplify your model by including only the building information you 
need to get the project done on time.
On the other end of the spectrum is the one-man-show looking to cut overhead. When 
compared to other popular design and documentation programs available on the market, 
this workflow is very inexpensive. By adding a few plugins to SketchUp Pro, you’ll have full 
capability to efficiently design, draft, render, analyze, and document any project.
Anyone who reads this book will take away excellent organization and problem-solving 
strategies for SketchUp. The techniques presented will help any designer create more engag-
ing and accurate 3D models that are easily shared across several platforms. 
What’s in This Book?
The advanced concepts and operations covered in this book are organized into four separate 
and distinct parts.
Part I: Start the Flow
Part I takes care of some administrative tasks and disclaimers common in an instructional 
software book. In Part I, you will learn the benefits of using SketchUp Pro and LayOut, and 
you will be introduced to the power of this system. Also, you will be exposed to a new way 
of thinking about BIM. Part I wraps up by explaining folder and file organization techniques 
that will help keep your projects running smoothly.
Part II: SketchUp
In Part II you will learn the basic, intermediate, and advanced SketchUp skills necessary 
to complete the exercises in this book. You will also tune your SketchUp environment 
for professional use. You will learn to create utility styles and scenes, custom layers, and 
ultimately your own custom default template. Even if you are an experienced SketchUp user, 
you will benefit from the refresher and most likely will develop a new understanding of the 
old features.

7
Chapter 1: Introduction
Part III: LayOut
Part III is an “everything you need to know” guide for LayOut. At times, this section may 
read more like a manual than a tutorial because it explains every menu, dialog, and setting 
you will come across in LayOut. It also contains tutorials for creating custom scrapbooks 
and templates. Study this part closely even if you have used LayOut previously. The skills you 
learn in Part III will make you a fast and effective LayOut draftsman.
Part IV: The Architectural Design Process
The traditional architectural design process consists of five major phases: schematic design, 
design development, construction documents, bidding and negotiations, and construction 
administration. The design process presented in Part IV has been whittled down to four 
main phases: site analysis (SA), schematic design (SD), design development (DD), and 
construction documents (CD).
Although they are very important steps in the design process, this book will not directly 
address construction administration (CA), or bidding and negotiation (BN).  SketchUp can 
be used for cost estimating, but does not typically play a major role in negotiating numbers 
with a contractor. SketchUp can also play a role in CA, but the skills you will learn in the 
other four phases can be easily applied to the construction administration phase.
What Are the Prerequisites?
This is an extremely advanced book. It assumes that you are already familiar with many of 
the tools and basic functions in SketchUp, including groups, components, edges, surfaces, 
dividing surfaces, styles, layers, and scenes. You also need to know and understand basic 
computer terms and concepts such as right-click, left-click, windows, files, folders, drop-
down menus, zipped, unzip, extract, etc.
To make the most of this book, you should have some experience with SketchUp, but 
even if you don’t you can still benefit. You don’t have to have any experience with LayOut. 
Parts II and III cover the essential skills you’ll need to complete the advanced exercises in 
Part IV.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
The following resources will help you make the most of this book.
☑
☑SketchUp 101 is an excellent class to help you get over the initial SketchUp learning 
curve; it is offered for free at www.suexch.com. The topics covered in SketchUp 101 
include creating geometry, modifying geometry, and inference locking. It includes two 
building exercises that pull everything together.
☑
☑SketchUp 201 is a commercially available class that covers the next level of intermediate 
concepts; it is available at  www.suexch.com. The topics covered include: groups, compo-
nents, layers, scenes, styles, layout, geomodeling, and general model organization.
These classes are helpful, but they are not required to utilize The SketchUp Workflow for 
Architecture. Everything you need is included in this book.
Free SketchUp or SketchUp Pro?
The free version of SketchUp is for hobbyists; it is intended for the weekend warrior 
designing a deck or a student working on a school project. The free version has been 
stripped of many capabilities that are needed to create professional presentations; it lacks 
exporters for 3D models and can’t create high-resolution images or animations, features that 
professionals need.
SketchUp Pro contains everything a professional needs to create engaging and precise 
presentations that accurately represent their designs. Using the Pro version, you can pre­sent 
and explain 3D designs in LayOut (2D page-creation software included with SketchUp Pro), 
use several export options to share work (including .dwg format), and create HD anima-
tions and high-resolution renderings. Figure 1.6 compares the features of SketchUp and 
SketchUp Pro.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Mental Preparation
SketchUp is fast, fun, and intuitive—but only after a lot of practice! SketchUp is not 
easy. SketchUp marketing has done an excellent job of publicizing the simple use of 
SketchUp. It is extremely approachable in that you can open the program, click on the 
Line tool, and start drawing. Shortly after you create your first surface, the Push/Pull tool 
will enable you to quickly generate massive amounts of 3D geometry. However, once you 
start modeling with these simple tools, you’ll quickly have more questions than answers. 
This lack of knowledge coupled with the desire to perform advanced operations can 
cause frustration.
Mentally prepare yourself to learn this software and the workflow presented in this book. 
Push aside any preconceived notions of “3D for everyone.” Ignore your colleague’s comments 
about SketchUp being easy to learn, simple to use, and not nearly as powerful as other 3D 
programs. SketchUp is similar to other CAD programs in that you need to spend a signifi-
cant amount of time learning to use it in order to fully leverage it. Accept the fact that any 
program is easy to open and play with; but to fully understand any 3D application, including 
SketchUp, you’ll need to fully invest your time, patience, and effort.

Chapter 2
Building Information 
Modeling
B
uilding Information Modeling (BIM) is the latest buzz in architectural 
design and drafting. Is BIM a revolution or just the way the industry 
works these days? In this chapter, you will be encouraged to contemplate 
and challenge the popular assumptions and standard definition of BIM. 
By doing so, you should realize that integrating the benefits of BIM into 
your workflow is easier and cheaper than you ever thought.
What Is BIM?
“Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of physical and functional 
characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a shared knowledge resource for information about 
a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from 
earliest conception to demolition.” (National BIM Standard--United States) A building 
information model (BIM) is an intelligent model that integrates design, visualization, 
simulation, and collaboration into one process. The model is a physical representation, but it 
can also be informative. The model not only shows a client what a building will look like, but 
it also gives the client and designer a better understanding of how the building will function. 
A BIM is essentially a shared, digital building prototype that helps everyone on the design 
team make better decisions.

21
Stages and Uses
A building information model is intended to be used during every phase of the design 
process, and by every member on the team.
Architects typically create the main model and then share it with consultants who use 
the BIM to ensure that their trades don’t interfere with the building’s function or other 
trades. For instance, a duct physically can’t run through a beam. It is better to catch issues 
like this on the computer rather than in the field. This BIM feature is commonly referred to 
as clash detection. 
Building owners and facility managers can also use the BIM after the building is complete. 
For example, a BIM could help them track down the source of a stained ceiling by locating 
plumbing lines or by indicating possible weaknesses in the roof membrane.
TIP  In reality, most building owners and facility managers won’t use the building 
information model to solve problems—but they could. If they were to use a program, 
however, they’d find that the SketchUp viewer is free and very approachable.
Features
BIM is a concept not a software program. However, there are software programs that use 
the BIM concept to execute the design process. There is no official BIM features list, but here 
are a few popular features that most people expect to find in a BIM program:
☑
☑3D modeling
☑
☑Model life-cycle use with the building, from predesign to demolition
☑
☑Interoperability with consultants and their CAD platforms
☑
☑Dynamic links between the 3D model and the construction documents. (When a 
change is made in a plan, that change is reflected in all other drawings, sections, eleva-
tions, and reflected ceiling plans.)
☑
☑Photorealistic rendering and raytracing
☑
☑Parametric modeling, both input and output
☑
☑Clash detection
☑
☑Energy analysis
☑
☑Cost analysis
☑
☑4D construction phasing and schedule management

22
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
SketchUp and LayOut as BIM
Coming as a surprise to most, SketchUp and LayOut contain many of the most popular BIM 
software features. With the workflow presented in this book, SketchUp and LayOut pull 
the best features from each of the most popular drafting platforms (2D CAD and 3D BIM). 
Using this workflow, you can incorporate BIM’s fundamental features into your projects. 
This section outlines what makes SketchUp and LayOut such a powerful design and 
documentation tool and explains why it is a unique design and documentation method.
Advantages
Some of the advantages of using SketchUp and LayOut as a design and documentation 
method are listed here:
☑
☑SketchUp is a surface modeler, which means that all objects created in SketchUp are 
composed of lines and surfaces. The process of drawing lines in SketchUp is very similar 
to the familiar process used to draw lines in 2D CAD. SketchUp could be described as a 
2D CAD program that operates in a 3D environment.
☑
☑When you build a 3D model in SketchUp using The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture, 
you are simultaneously creating the construction documents. All 2D plans, sections, and 
elevations are dynamically linked to the 3D model. SketchUp allows you to think and 
design in 3D, which is the way your brain is wired to work. This is in sharp contrast to 
using other popular BIM software where you draft the construction documents, which 
in turn creates the 3D model. In SketchUp, you think and design in 3D; the presentation 
and construction documents are products of the design process. (See Figure 2.1 and

☑The lack of some features in SketchUp is a blessing in disguise. Because the rules for 
modeling and organizing are simple, there are fewer questions for the program to ask 
and, therefore, fewer questions for you to answer. The simplicity of SketchUp and LayOut 
lets you create and organize the model quickly, without interruptions. For example, to 
add a wall in some BIM software packages, you would have to assign several properties, 
such as height, thickness, material, color, and insulation. To add a wall in SketchUp, you 
simply draw a rectangle and pull it up—no questions asked. (In Figure 2.3 through Fig-
ure 2.5, the drafting and modeling were completed using SketchUp Pro, LayOut, and The 
SketchUp Workflow for Architecture.)

☑SketchUp offers real-time rendering, which provides infinitely better information so 
you can make better design decisions than you can with other software. In SketchUp, 
a house looks like a house, siding looks like siding, and concrete looks like concrete. In 
2D CAD, a house looks like a flat collection of cyan and magenta lines. The graphical 
representations of most textures leave disconnects between the drawings and real-world 
applications of the materials. The better the 3D information is that you have during the 
design process, the better your design decisions will be. Figure 2.6 shows the same proj-
ect in 2D CAD and in SketchUp.

Disadvantages
Some of the disadvantages of using SketchUp and LayOut as a design and documentation 
method include:
☑
☑SketchUp lacks parametric modeling features. Dynamic components can be used to 
compensate for some of this, but they are fairly difficult to master. Ultimately, parametric 
modeling attributes can be exported and viewed in spreadsheets as reports; however, 
changing the spreadsheet will not be reflected in the model.
☑
☑Scheduling is done the old-fashioned way. The door and window tags are not con-
nected to the door and window schedules. The tags and schedules must be coordinated 
manually.
☑
☑Sheets are coordinated the old-fashioned way as well. There is no information exchange 
between sheets, drawings, tags, and callouts. The drawings must be coordinated 
manually.
☑
☑LayOut dimensions do not update automatically when changes are made in SketchUp. 
If you move a wall in SketchUp, you will need to go back and correct the dimensions in 
any drawings that display that wall.
☑
☑Entities do not attach to each other. For instance, windows and doors do not attach 
to walls. So, if you move the wall, you will also need to move the doors and windows 
separately.
Filling in the BIM Blanks
You can use plugins to extend SketchUp’s BIM features. Third parties are creating plugins 
that expand the SketchUp universe and provide features that fill the BIM voids. Although 
the plugins listed in this section are not officially endorsed by or included in The SketchUp 
Workflow for Architecture, they provide a great place to begin your search to expand BIM 
capabilities.

The SketchUp Outlook
For a few good years, Google owned SketchUp and supported it. Among other features, 
Google SketchUp introduced styles, the Follow Me tool, MatchPhoto, integration with Google 
Maps and Google Earth, and a huge leap forward with LayOut. The Google years were exciting 
at first, but after SketchUp 7 Google seemed to lose interest in the project and deprioritized it.
Why would such a cool company do this to such a cool program? Perhaps it was because 
lighter cloud programs such as Google Building Maker can create 3D models for Google 
Earth, which was one of the original reasons Google purchased SketchUp. Another possibil-
ity is that taking on the architectural drafting industry juggernauts didn’t fit into Google’s 
mission statement, which is to organize the world’s information and make it universally 
accessible and useful. Either way, SketchUp was put on the back burner for several years dur-
ing a period of minimal releases and minimal new features. Nobody likes a breakup, but it 
was time for SketchUp to tell Google, “It’s not me, it’s you.”
Google handled the breakup with maturity and sensitivity to the loyal SketchUp commu-
nity by finding a buyer who really appreciated the product. Trimble, the new owners, might 
not have the allure and mystique Google has, but they do have some radical hardware. 

32
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Trimble creates GPS devices for automating farm equipment and efficiently fertilizing crops. 
They build handheld devices for construction management. Interestingly enough, Trimble 
creates 3D laser scanners. These high-tech machines can be placed in a room and within 
minutes they can generate an accurate as-built 3D model of the space. Yet another intrigu-
ing product that Trimble owns is Tekla, a BIM program aimed toward engineering. Now, 
with the purchase of SketchUp, they possess a wildly popular 3D platform that architects 
embrace. SketchUp may have been close to extinction, but now its future looks great.

Project Management
U
nwavering, relentless organization is essential to a successful 
project. Just like a messy desk, a messy PROJECT folder can 
cause miscommunication, lost work, and ultimately cost you time and 
money. The techniques illustrated in this chapter will help you organize 
your design projects. Keep in mind that this is not a rigid system; the 
suggested workflow is flexible and can be tweaked to meet your specific 
needs. In other words, feel free to modify this method any way you see fit 
to meet your project type and office standards.
Folders and Files
Approaching folders and files the same way every time will help your team collaborate 
efficiently. First, you need to understand some standard ground rules regarding how to 
organize PROJECT folders. Then you can apply the logic of this system to your PROJECT 
folders and further develop your own set of standards.
Naming Standards
Take a moment to invent an identifying acronym. This shouldn’t be too hard; architects and 
designers do it all of the time—for example, HOK, RNL, and SOM. Your identifying acronym 
will be used to name files and many other things that you create in the digital world. This is 
important, not necessarily from a marketing point of view, but from an organizational point 
of view so that everyone knows who made the file. The acronym used for the examples in 

34
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
this book is BIC, which stands for Bright Ideas Consultants. Anticipate replacing the “BIC” 
with your own identifying acronym as you complete the exercises in this book.
Folders
Folders contain files and other folders, and they have a strong tendency to become a 
complete mess. Read the next sentence several times so it is etched into your memory. The 
contents of a folder should present the fewest number of choices, and all choices should be 
self-explanatory. That sentence thoroughly describes folder organization logic, and it is the 
keystone of an organized folder.
All PROJECT folder names should be in capital letters to clearly and concisely describe the 
folder—for example, OFFICE REMODEL. Ideally, all subfolder names within the project folder 
will be one word in caps; frequently, subfolder names are abbreviated. For instance, adminis-
trative files such as contracts and correspondence will be stored in a folder named ADMIN. 
Pictures, sketches, and diagrams will be kept in a folder named IMAGES. By capitalizing the 
file folder names, you are visually separating those folder names from the filenames residing 
in the same folder.
Files
An efficient filename gives the user as much information as possible without ever looking at 
the file properties (Figure 3.1).
Figure 3.1  Clear, concise, and informative filename
For example, examine the filename BIC_Office Remodel – Existing Conditions.skp. 
This file was created by Bright Ideas Consultants, is part of the Office Remodel project, illus-
trates the existing conditions, and opens in SketchUp. By providing this information in the 
filename, you answer many questions about the file before anyone even tries to open it. Any 
consultant or member of your team who opens your files will immediately know where the 
files came from and how to use them.
Only one current version of each file should be stored in the main PROJECT folder. Avoid 
giving files confusing names that will make sense only at the moment you name it. Do not 
name files with the words current, best, use this, or delete. These types of filenames do 
not make it perfectly clear which file in the main PROJECT folder is actually the current file. 
Vague filenames provide users with ambiguous information, cause confusion, and ultimately 
lead to duplicated work and lost time. See Figure 3.2.

35
Chapter 3: Project Management
Figure 3.2  A typical PROJECT folder
Standard Folders
By placing your folders in logical places, you help your team keep track of active projects and 
their associated files. To start organizing your projects, you only need three basic folders: a 
TEMP folder, an ACTIVE PROJECTS folder, and an ARCHIVE folder. Again, this is not a rigid 
system; you can customize it to a system that works for you.
TEMP Folder
One way to keep junk files from accumulating on your machine is to create a place to dump 
them. Create a TEMP folder on your desktop.
The TEMP folder is for anything that you don’t need to keep. This is a great place to save 
program installers, quick sketches, and email attachments. Files saved in this folder will not 
be missed when this folder is emptied. Every month or so, go into the TEMP folder and 
delete all of its contents. If you wonder whether or not you will need a file, more than likely 
you should save it in a PROJECT folder rather than save it in the TEMP folder.
On a side note, never save anything onto your desktop. The only items that should be on 
your desktop are the Recycle Bin, TEMP folder, ARCHIVE folder, ACTIVE PROJECTS folder, 
and possibly some application shortcuts. Never save files to your desktop. If you just need to 
use a file briefly, save it in the TEMP folder. If you ignore this rule, your desktop will become 
a mess (Figure 3.3).

36
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 3.3  A clean desktop is neater and easier to use than a messy desktop.

37
Chapter 3: Project Management
TIP  Eliminate application shortcuts from your desktop by dragging them to the Start 
Bar menu, or by dragging them to the bottom of your screen and pinning them to the 
taskbar.
ACTIVE PROJECTS Folder
An active project is one that you access on a daily to weekly basis. The files within the 
ACTIVE PROJECTS folder change daily. Create a folder on your desktop and name it ACTIVE 
PROJECTS, or place it on a shared server. Save all current and active projects into your 
ACTIVE PROJECTS folder using the folder and file naming structures previously described.
TIP  Always be aware of exactly where you are saving your active files and projects. 
Avoid using My Recent Documents to open files.
ARCHIVE Folder
An inactive project is a project that has already been invoiced, been paid, and probably 
won’t be accessed again. Saving all finished work is important, just in case phase two comes 
around or you need to pull a piece of a model from a past project to use on a current 
project. Create a folder on your desktop and name it ARCHIVE. Inactive projects should be 
saved in the ARCHIVE folder on your desktop.
TIP  For more information about adding completed projects to the ARCHIVE folder, 
see “Closing a Project” later in this chapter.
RESOURCES Folder
Within the ACTIVE PROJECTS folder, create another folder named RESOURCES. The 
RESOURCES folder holds all of your components, materials, plugins, scrapbooks, styles, and 
templates. You can also store Windows Themes, preferences.dat files, fonts, and anything 
else that you use across all of your machines in this folder. Add a folder for each category as 
shown in Figure 3.4. Consider prefixing each folder name with your identifying acronym.

38
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 3.4  A typical RESOURCES folder
PROJECT Folders
This section suggests a starting point and system to help you organize your PROJECT 
folders. A PROJECT folder should contain the following subfolders: ADMIN, ARCHIVE, 
CONSULTANTS, EXPORTS, IMAGES, and MISC. Your particular projects can include other 
folders if needed.
The main project files, typically SketchUp and LayOut files, should be stored in the main 
PROJECT folder with the other project subfolders (Figure 3.5). This will provide easy access to 
the most frequently used files, which usually have the .skp and .layout filename extensions.
ADMIN Folder
The ADMIN folder should contain all administrative files. You should save contracts, time 
sheets, product specification sheets, correspondence, and memos that relate to the project 
in this folder (Figure 3.6). A safe rule of thumb is that if a file is not graphic in nature, it 
probably belongs in the ADMIN folder. Typical file extensions found in this folder are .doc, 
.xls, and .pdf.

Chapter 3: Project Management

Figure 3.6  A typical ADMIN folder
ARCHIVE Folder
The ARCHIVE folder is used to preserve past versions of all important project files. Typically, 
you should store only zipped files and zipped folders in the ARCHIVE folder (Figure 3.7). All 
files should be titled with the naming convention YYMMDD_Files.zip or YYMMDD_Exports.zip. 

40
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
By designating project files and exports within the .zip filename, you will be able to easily 
sort the archives and find any files you need. Because you will rarely access these files, they 
can be compressed into .zip files to save disk space.
Figure 3.7  A typical ARCHIVE folder
TIP  For more information on creating .zip files and backing up your work, see the 
“Archiving” section later in this chapter.
CONSULTANTS Folder
All of the files you receive from consultants should be saved in the CONSULTANTS 
folder within their respective folders. Typical subfolders include ELEC, MECH, PLUMB, 
and STRUCT (Figure 3.8). Each consultant you work with should have their own folder. 
Typically, a consultant’s folder contains not only .dwg files, but also .pdf files that 
represent the .dwg files.
Within each consultant’s folder, add subfolders with the naming convention YYMMDD. This 
will provide a record of when you received the files from each consultant.

41
Chapter 3: Project Management
Figure 3.8  A typical CONSULTANTS folder
EXPORTS Folder
The EXPORTS folder will hold anything that you produce, or export, from your main project 
files. Some examples of exports are 3D models, 2D .dwg files, and image exports. To help you 
keep track of your exports, use the YYMMDD naming convention for subfolders. This folder 
naming system will also make it easy to create archive .zip files.
Because you probably will be exporting several files a day, it is convenient to have one 
folder that always has the current backgrounds and the entire current set of files ready to 
print. Create a CURRENT SET subfolder. This folder should always contain all of the current 
.dwg backgrounds and .pdf prints associated with the project. Whenever someone needs 
to have a set of documents printed, or CAD backgrounds updated, you can go to this folder 
to access the most current set. This also means that whenever you export to a YYMMDD 
folder, you will need to overwrite the files in the CURRENT SET folder to keep those exports 
up to date. See Figure 3.9.
TIP  As the project progresses, turn your EXPORTS folders into .zip files. The folders 
within the EXPORTS folder should be compressed as new, dated EXPORT folders are 
created. Once you are confident that these exports are not needed on a daily basis, 
move them to your ARCHIVE folder.

42
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 3.9  A typical EXPORTS folder
IMAGES Folder
The IMAGES folder will hold any photographs, field measurements, sketches, and diagrams 
relating to the project. Organize the subfolders using the YYMMDD_Description naming 
convention. You probably will want to separate site photos from interior photos from 
concept photos. The following folders will help keep them organized not only by the subject 
of the photographs, but also by date: YYMMDD_Site Visit, YYMMDD_Interiors, YYMMDD_
Concepts (Figure 3.10).
MISC Folder
The MISC folder is the TEMP folder of a project. Save whatever you want within your MISC 
folder as long as it relates to the project; everyone needs a junk drawer. Subfolders of the 
MISC folder should be named using capitalized initials so that everyone on the team has 
their own junk drawer (Figure 3.11). Typically, components, sketch models, and texture 
images will end up in this folder. Take time every month or so to clean out the backup files 
and auto-save files to be sure that you don’t waste space on your system.

ACTIVITY

45
Chapter 3: Project Management
Cloud Storage
Consider saving your ACTIVE PROJECTS folder to the cloud for safe keeping, automatic 
archiving, and additional sharing options (Figure 3.13). Some standard features that many 
cloud storage solutions offer include:
☑
☑Automatic archiving
☑
☑File sharing without the need for an FTP site
☑
☑Access to previous versions of files and 
folders
☑
☑Seamless access to all of your files and fold-
ers on all of your computers
☑
☑File access from an Internet browser or 
smart phone
☑
☑Large file sharing without the need to 
email them
☑
☑Team sharing of PROJECT folders, even with team members who are not in your office
Archiving
Clients change their minds. Systems crash. Data gets lost. Archiving is your free insurance 
policy that protects your time and work. Archiving is essential to a clean PROJECT folder and 
successful file management.
Archiving allows you to keep a copy of your work in case of an unexpected crash, accidental 
deletion, or any loss of data. Archiving also helps protect you from indecisive clients because 
you can revert back to previous versions without re-creating work. The techniques outlined in 
this section make it is easy to keep a running record of your work for a swift recovery.
Strategy
You don’t need to archive everything all the time. You need to archive only the files that 
are constantly changing. Typically, these will be the files saved in the main PROJECT folder, 
the .skp and .layout files. You don’t need to constantly archive the IMAGES folder or the 
ADMIN folder because these folders rarely change and do not reflect your time and work.
Figure 3.13  Several cloud services are 
available, many of which have free or very 
low-cost plans.

46
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  You would be wise to archive before you begin making any major changes. 
Typically, you should archive at least once a day for an active project.
Creating a Project Snapshot
Select all of the current project files, right-click on the selections, and select Send 
To c Compressed (Zipped) Folder. Name the .zip file using the file-naming convention 
YYMMDD.01_Files.zip. Use the number at the end to track snapshots throughout the day 
(Figure 3.14).
Figure 3.14  Create a project snapshot using a .zip file.
Organizing
Now drag the .zip file to your ARCHIVE folder in the main PROJECT folder (Figure 3.15). By 
naming the .zip archive files with the YYMMDD naming standard, you can easily sort them 
by name. Just click on the Name header in your file browser to put the files in chronological 
order by the date they were created and also in the proper order throughout the day. You 
could use the Date Modified tab within your file explorer as well; however, if you make 
any changes to the .zip file while looking for an old file, the files will no longer be in the 
correct order. The filename is always static and will allow you to keep archives in perfect 
chronological order.

47
Chapter 3: Project Management
Figure 3.15  Drag the new .zip file to the ARCHIVE folder.
Closing a Project
Regardless of how long a project drags on, one day you will eventually finish. When you do, 
you should remove the PROJECT folder from your CURRENT PROJECTS folder to free up 
disk space. Once a project is complete, it is important to close the project and create a final 
archive in your main ARCHIVE folder.
TIP  Before you archive a project, consider deleting all past archives within the project 
ARCHIVE folder. This may or may not be appropriate depending on the project and its 
potential to resurface.
Archive the entire project folder by right-clicking on the actual PROJECT folder and select-
ing Send To c Compressed (Zipped) Folder. This creates a separate .zip file that contains the 
files and folder structure of your project file in a compressed format. You can now delete the 
entire project folder and move the project .zip file to your ARCHIVE folder on your desktop. 
Here it will sit until you need to access the contents in the far and distant future.
TIP  To be safe, burn these archives onto a disk, store them on a jump drive, or copy 
them to an external hard drive, and then store them in a safe as an additional layer of 
protection. You never know what can happen!

48
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Re-opening a Project
The time may come when you need to re-open a project. To do so, right-click on the project 
.zip file within the ARCHIVE folder and choose Extract All. Click on the Browse button and 
choose the CURRENT PROJECTS folder on your desktop. Click Extract. All of the files will 
be restored to your CURRENT PROJECTS folder and maintain their original file and folder 
structures.
If you only need a couple of files within the archive, double-click into a zipped folder to 
view its contents, the same as you would a regular folder. Once in the zipped folder, drag 
and drop individual files into your TEMP folder for inspection. This does not actually move 
the file out of the .zip file; it makes a copy of it and leaves your archive intact.
Chapter Points
☑
☑The small amount of time you invest in organizing files will pay for itself hundreds of 
times over throughout the design process.
☑
☑Always know where you are opening a file from and where you are saving it. Never use 
My Recent Documents to open files.
☑
☑Archive often, sometimes multiple times during the day. It is better to archive too much 
rather than too little.
☑
☑Archive with .zip files to save disk space.
☑
☑For added convenience and protection from data loss, send your current files to the 
cloud.

SketchUp
SketchUp is an excellent design tool that gives designers the flexibility 
they need to sketch in a 3D digital world. SketchUp was once 
considered useful only for preliminary schematic designs; however, if 
you incorporate the organizational techniques taught in The SketchUp 
Workflow for Architecture, SketchUp is capable of much more. In this 
section, you’ll learn about the SketchUp tools, environment, and how to 
use collections and ruby scripts. Before you get into the details, however, 
you need to make sure you are up to snuff on the basics and that your 
default SketchUp template is optimized for professional use.
P A R T  I I


Chapter 4
SketchUp Basics
I
n order to use the methods in this book, you must understand the 
concepts, tools, and commands presented in this chapter. Any 
additional knowledge you have is a plus. However, don’t underestimate 
the usefulness of this chapter, even if you already consider yourself a 
SketchUp expert. It has plenty of tips, tricks, and helpful theories that will 
come up again later.
Five Core Concepts
Before you even open SketchUp, you need to 
understand the core concepts that make it 
unique. First, SketchUp is a surface modeler 
that is unlike most 3D modeling programs. 
Everything in SketchUp is composed of edges 
and surfaces, the basic building blocks used 
in SketchUp. A surface cannot exist without a 
closed loop of coplanar edges, and the simplest 
surface possible is a triangle (Figure 4.1).
Second, because it is a surface modeler, there 
are no true, perfect vector curves, arcs, or circles 
in SketchUp. However, you can still represent 
circles and curves with a series of small edges 
(Figure 4.2).
Figure 4.1  All of the endpoints (corners) 
of the triangle are at the same blue eleva-
tion—in other words, the edges are all on 
the same plane (coplanar).

52
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Third, SketchUp geometry has a tendency 
to stick together. This concept is known as the 
“stickiness of geometry” in SketchUp. Adjoining 
surfaces stick together and move with each other. 
Connected endpoints will move with each other 
and stretch their corresponding lines (Figure 4.3). 
Even though this can be frustrating at first, once 
you learn to control the stickiness, you will realize 
how much it speeds up the modeling process.
Figure 4.3  Adjacent geometry sticks together in SketchUp.
Fourth, geometry does not stack in SketchUp. Only one edge or surface can exist 
between the same series of points. Even when multiple edges are drawn on top of each 
other, the edges simply combine into one. When an edge is drawn that intersects or overlaps 
an existing edge, the existing edge will be broken into two pieces (Figure 4.4).
Figure 4.4  Stacked edges merge into one with edges seg-
mented at the overlaps.
Figure 4.2  Circles and curves are 
represented by a series of smaller line 
segments. Increasing the number of 
segments makes a smoother circle, but 
can also decrease computer perfor-
mance and lead to large file sizes.

53
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Lastly, the inference engine is the “brain” in SketchUp that is always working for you; it 
is what assumes meaningful relationships between points, edges, and surfaces. Although 
you can’t turn off the inference engine, you can control it through the power of suggestion. 
There are several inferences available in SketchUp, some are shown in Figure 4.5.
Figure 4.5  Most inferences require modifier keys or hovering on entities to “encourage” an 
inference.
Leveraging SketchUp
The five core concepts combine to make SketchUp a fast, fun, and unique 3D modeling 
program, but using it is not necessarily easy. By embracing and controlling these core 
concepts, you’ll be able to successfully leverage SketchUp into your workflow.
Selecting a Template
When you open the SketchUp application, the first window you’ll see is the Welcome 
to SketchUp window (Figure 4.6). You can also access it by clicking on the Help drop-
down menu and choosing Welcome to SketchUp. From there, you can access learning 
resources, license information, and most important for now your default template. Within 
the Template tab, select the Plan View – Feet and Inches template and then click on Start 
Using SketchUp.

54
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.6  The Welcome to SketchUp window appears automati-
cally when SketchUp is first opened.
Navigating the 3D Environment
The best way to navigate in SketchUp is to use a three-button scroll-wheel mouse, even 
when you’re working on a laptop with a touch pad. Push down on the scroll-wheel button 
to orbit, hold down the Shift key with the scroll-wheel button to pan, and roll the scroll-
wheel to zoom (Figure 4.7).

You don’t need to use the Camera Tools icons on your screen because all of the Naviga-
tion tools are readily available at your fingertips (Figure 4.8). Actually, you’ll be better off if 
you completely ignore these icons. If you use them, you’ll have to search your screen outside 
of the work area. Every time you take your eyes off your design, you’ll focus on the wrong 
thing. Furthermore, you’ll give yourself a headache when you have to hunt around the 
screen for buttons.
Figure 4.8  Avoid using the Camera Tools icons. The 
most frequently used Navigation tools are readily 
available on your three-button scroll-wheel mouse.
Your cursor is the focal point of all navigation. Position it on the object you want to 
zoom in on, pan by, or orbit around so you will have more navigational control.
When you’re completing any task in SketchUp, always navigate to a view that is strategic 
for the task at hand. For instance, if you are trying to work on the elevation, don’t look at 
the model from a plan view. For any operation, you should always first determine the view 
that will make it easiest to perform the task. Also, be sure to utilize your large LCD monitor 
and really zoom in on the area you are working on.
Measurements
The Measurements dialog in SketchUp gives you complete control over any tool. Keep in 
mind that the Measurements dialog is always ready for your input. You never need to click 
in the Measurements dialog to enter a precise dimension or value; you just need to start 
typing.
By default, the Measurements toolbar is docked at the bottom-right corner of the 
SketchUp interface. You can reposition this toolbar by clicking on the View drop-down 
menu and choosing Toolbars c Measurements. Once the Measurements toolbar is floating, 
it can be repositioned or docked anywhere on the screen (Figure 4.9). The screen captures 
used in this chapter show a floating Measurements toolbar.

Figure 4.9  The Measurements dialog changes depending on the tool and the type of input it 
needs.
Creating Geometry
The most frequently used tools for creating geometry in SketchUp can be categorized 
into two groups: the Drawing tools and the Modification tools. To get started with any 
model, you must first create the geometry using the Drawing tools (the Line tool, Rectangle 
tool, Circle tool, Arc tool, Polygon tool, and Freehand tool). Once you’ve created simple 
2D geometry, you can shape and change that geometry into a more complex form using 
the Modification tools (the Move tool, Push/Pull tool, Rotate tool, Follow Me tool, Scale 
tool, and Offset tool). Throughout the modeling process, you will likely go back and forth 
between these toolsets (Figure 4.10). Use the Drawing tools to create simple 2D geometry 
and make additional edges to break surfaces to set up operations for the Modification tools.
Figure 4.10  To efficiently model in SketchUp, you’ll need to move back and forth between the 
Drawing and Modification tools. Use the Drawing tools to make additional edges and break 
surfaces to set up operations for the Modification tools.

57
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Drawing Tools
The Drawing tools can be further broken down into two groups: 
the Surface Drawing tools and the Edge Drawing tools. A Surface 
Drawing tool creates a closed loop of coplanar edges, including 
a surface, in a specified shape. An Edge Drawing tool creates 
straight and curved edges (no surface). These tools provide 
infinite combinations to complete additive and subtractive 
modeling operations (Figure 4.11).
Surface Drawing Tools
The Surface Drawing tools include the Rectangle, Circle, and 
Polygon tools. All of these tools create a closed loop of coplanar 
edges and a surface. It is best to start building a model using 
these tools (Figure 4.12).
Figure 4.12  Typically, 
you will begin a model 
using one of the Sur-
face Drawing tools.
To use the Surface Drawing tools, you’ll need to click twice. Click once to start, move 
your cursor to suggest a direction, then click again to finish. Keep in mind that you can enter 
precise dimensions during the command or after the command, until another command is 
started. The same is true for most SketchUp tools.
TIP  The best way to execute most SketchUp commands is to use the click-and-release 
method. The click-and-drag method will get you into trouble because it is easy to 
accidentally perform small unnoticeable commands with many of the tools. Typically, 
you should click once to start, move your cursor, click again to finish, and then enter a 
precise dimension.
Figure 4.11  The Drawing 
toolbar

58
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Rectangle Tool
The Rectangle tool is a very effective tool for creating surfaces, and it certainly is one of 
the most frequently used tools in SketchUp. One of its great features is that the geometry 
it creates is always aligned with the axes. This means that you can create four edges and a 
surface, all squared up, with just two clicks (Figure 4.13).
Figure 4.13  The Rectangle tool in action
1.	 Activate the Rectangle tool and click once to start.
2.	 Move your cursor to suggest a direction and click again to finish.
3.	 At this point, you can enter precise dimensions such as 120,120, then press Enter.
TIP  You can override the alignment with axes by starting a rectangle on an off-axis 
edge. The Rectangle tool will align new geometry with the edge on which it is started.
Circle and Polygon Tools
Because SketchUp is a surface modeler—meaning that the basic building blocks are edges 
and surfaces—there are no “true” circles in SketchUp. All circles are represented by a series of 
connected edges. The more sides a circle has, the smoother it looks (Figure 4.14). The default 
number of sides for a circle is 24 sides, and this number works for just about any circle 
you will need to create. Keep in mind that when you extrude a circle into a 3D form, every 
edge will become a surface with three additional edges. As a result, the more edges you have,

59
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
the more 3D surfaces you create, and ultimately the slower your model will perform, which 
can be problematic.
Figure 4.14  Two cylinders with different side counts. At what point  
are more segments unnoticeable?
Be aware of what you are modeling and how many sides you will need to achieve the 
quality you want. If you are creating a close-up rendering of a column, it would be appropri-
ate to increase the number of sides before you create the circle base of the column. If you 
are rendering several columns for a building off in the distance, you could decrease the num-
ber of sides used to create the circle bases of the columns. There are times when a drastically 
lower number of sides is not noticeable. When you activate the Circle tool, you can change 
the default number of sides used to represent a circle (Figure 4.15).
Figure 4.15  The Circle tool in action

60
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
To create a circle, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Circle tool, then immediately type 48 and press Enter to change the 
default number of sides on a circle to 48 sides.
2.	 Click once to define the center point of the circle.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the center point on axis, click again to finish.
4.	 At this point, you can enter a precise radius such as 120, then press Enter.
The Polygon tool works the same way the Circle tool does. The difference between the 
two is that a polygon’s edges are not softened when extruded (Figure 4.16).
Figure 4.16  A circle and polygon in 2D; a circle and polygon 
extruded into 3D
Edge Drawing Tools
The Edge Drawing tools include the Line, Arc, and Freehand tools (Figure 4.17). These tools 
only create edges, not surfaces. You can use the Edge Drawing tools to make small additive 
and subtractive adjustments to existing surfaces. Although they aren’t the most efficient 
tools for creating surfaces from scratch, you can use them to actually draw the sides of a 
closed loop of coplanar edges.

61
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Line Tool
The Line tool is the most basic Edge Drawing tool in SketchUp, and 
it is the tool with which most designers begin. Although it has many 
uses, surprisingly, using it is not the most effective way to create 
geometry. The Line tool is best used to make small adjustments and 
modifications.
When you’re drawing in 3D with the Line tool, you can draw on 
axis by  locking the Line tool on an axis.
To lock an axis, first find the axis and then hold down the Shift 
key to lock it. Finish the operation by clicking on a point to define 
the distance, and then release the Shift key. You can also lock an axis 
by tapping an arrow key while drawing a line. The Right arrow key 
locks the red axis, the Left arrow key locks the green axis, and the Up 
and Down arrow keys lock the blue axis.
Locking an axis eliminates two of the three dimensions, so all you need to do is define a 
distance along the specified locked axis (Figure 4.18). You can do this by using the inference 
engine to snap to a point, edge, or surface. Also, you can enter precise dimensions into the 
Measurements dialog.
Figure 4.18  Use either the Shift key or arrow keys to lock the 
Line tool on an axis.
The Line tool can also be used to heal surfaces (Figure 4.19). Right-click on an edge of a 
surface and choose Erase. When you erase an edge, you break the closed loop of coplanar 
edges and, in turn, lose the surface. Redraw the line from point to point and you will have 
the edge and surface back.
Figure 4.17  The 
Edge Drawing tools

62
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.19  Redraw a deleted edge using the Line tool to 
recreate the edge and surface at the same time.
Now, right-click on the surface and choose Erase to delete only the surface. Use the Line 
tool to retrace any edge around the closed loop of coplanar edges. The surface is now healed 
(Figure 4.20). Keep in mind that because geometry does not stack in SketchUp, there is only 
one edge remaining where you traced the edge.
Figure 4.20  Heal a deleted surface using the Line tool.
Arc Tool
Use the Arc Tool to create precise curves. 1. Click once to define the starting point of 
the arc. 2. Click again to define the endpoint of the arc, or enter a precise dimension into 
the measurements dialog. 3. Click once more to define the bulge (Figure 4.21). Using the 
Measurements dialog, you can also enter a specific distance for the bulge. 

63
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Figure 4.21  To use the Arc tool you’ll need to make three 
clicks: one for the start point, one for the endpoint, and one 
for the bulge.
When you’re using the Arc tool to round the corners of a rectangle, look for the magenta 
Equidistant and Tangent to Edge inferences (Figure 4.22). When you’re continuing an arc, 
look for the cyan Tangent at Vertex inference to make a smooth transition between the two 
arcs (Figure 4.23).
Figure 4.22  Rounding the corners of a rectangle

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.23  Continuing an arc
Freehand Tool
The Freehand tool is one of the few tools that require you to click and drag (Figure 4.24). 
You can use it to draw loose, sketchy lines. 1. Click and drag to draw a line. Release on the 
starting point to finish and create a surface.
Figure 4.24  When using the Freehand tool, be sure to finish 
on the starting point to create a surface.
TIP  To learn how to draw more accurate loose curves, read about the Bézier curve 
plugin in Chapter 8, “Ruby Scripts.”

65
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Modification Tools
Once you’ve created the geometry using the Drawing tools, you can change it using the 
Modification tools (Figure 4.25). The Modification tools can quickly transform 2D geometry 
into 3D objects and quickly create complex geometry by scaling, stretching, moving, and 
copying.
Figure 4.25  The Modification tools
The Select Tool
The Select tool is included in the Principal tools, but it is critical for using the Modification 
tools. Of all the tools you need to master, this one is by far the most underestimated 
and the most important. You will use the Select tool before you use most of the other 
SketchUp tools. Typically, you will default back to the Select tool after issuing a command. 
All modification operations are complemented by the Select tool. It is best to preselect an 
entity before you use the Modification tools. Some of the Modification tools have a hot 
spot that auto-selects entities, but you will find that you can obtain complete control by 
first preselecting an entity with the Select tool.
Click once on an edge or surface to select it. Double-click on a surface to select the sur-
face as well as the bounding edges. Triple-click on a surface to select all of the connected 
geometry (Figure 4.26).
Figure 4.26  Single-click, double-click, or triple-click to quickly 
select individual or multiple entities.

66
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
To perform a window selection, click and drag from left to right over the entities you 
want to select (Figure 4.27). Only the entities that are completely in the selection window 
will be selected. A window selection is represented by a solid selection window.
To perform a crossing selection, click and drag right to left over the entities you want to 
select. A crossing selection will select the entities that are completely within the selection 
window as well as any entity that the selection window touches. A crossing selection is rep-
resented by a dashed selection window.
Figure 4.27  Click and drag with the Select tool to create selection 
windows.
Hold down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) while you are using the Select tool to add 
entities to the selection. Hold down the Ctrl (Option on Mac) and Shift keys while you are 
using the Select tool to remove entities from the selection. Hold the Shift key while you 
are using the Select tool to inverse the selection. All of these modifier keys work with selec-
tion windows, too (Figure 4.28).
Figure 4.28  You can alter a selection by using modifier keys.

67
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
TIP  Before starting any command it is best to clear all selections. You can deselect 
all of the entities in a model by clicking on the Edit drop-down menu and choosing 
Deselect All, or by right-clicking on the model background.
To see additional selection options, right-click on an edge or surface (Figure 4.29). From 
this menu, you can select Bounding Edges, Connected Faces, All Connected, All on Same 
Layer, or All with Same Material. These unique selection options can help you make complex 
selections faster.
Figure 4.29  Right-click on a surface or an edge for additional selection options.
If you find yourself tediously picking through a model, keep in mind that there is always a 
fast and easy way to make the selection you need. Use a combination of all of the selection 
techniques to select only what you need in the most effective manner. Approach the selec-
tion process just as you do the modeling process; the process can be additive or subtractive. 
Before starting the selection, ask yourself if it would be easier to select several entities and 
then deselect what you don’t need, or would it be better to add each piece individually. Per-
haps using a combination of the two techniques would be the most effective. Every selec-
tion is different, so be sure to keep your approach flexible.
The Move Tool
The Move tool’s efficiency relies heavily on the stickiness of the geometry. You can move 
points, edges, and surfaces using the Move tool. Moving each of these entities has a different 
effect on the entity, as well as the adjacent, connected entities (Figure 4.30). The Move tool’s 

68
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
hot spot is right in the middle of the icon. Place your cursor on an edge or a surface, and 
note that the Move tool will auto-select entities. Click once to pick an entity up, then click 
again to put it down.
Figure 4.30  Move a point and the connecting edge will follow. Move an edge and the con-
necting edges will follow. Move a surface and all the bounding edges of the surface will move 
as well.
TIP  Beware! The Move tool is the number one destroyer of models. Be careful about 
what you are selecting and what is beyond your selection. You can select entities 
that are visibly blocked by other geometry, which makes it very easy to move entities 
accidentally and “blow out” the back of a model.
Precise Move
A precise move is executed by preselecting entities and then moving the selection from a 
specific spot on the selection to another specific spot in the model (Figure 4.31). A precise 
move can be started and ended on an edge, endpoint, midpoint, or surface, depending on 
the desired final location.
To make a precise move, follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, preselect the entity you want to move.
2.	 Activate the Move tool. Hover on the front-bottom corner of the cube until you see 
the Endpoint inference notification. Click once to pick up the cube.

69
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
3.	 Move your cursor, and the cube, to the front-bottom of the large cube. Hover on the 
corner until you see the Endpoint inference notification and click to place the cube.
Figure 4.31  A precise move
TIP  Don’t “eyeball it” when you can be precise.  When performing a precise move, be 
sure to snap to other entities in your model.
Linear Copy and Array
The Move tool is also the “copy tool.” To toggle the Copy command on and off, tap the Ctrl 
key (Option on Mac). As you are moving any entity, tap the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to 
leave a copy of it behind.
To make a copy, follow these steps (Figure 4.32):
1.	 Using the Select tool, preselect the entity that you want to copy.
2.	 Activate the Move tool and click once on the entity (you could start the copy from 
anywhere in the model).
3.	 Tap the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to toggle on the Copy command while you move 
the cursor along an axis, then click again to finish.
4.	 At this point, enter a precise distance into the Measurements dialog, such as 20f, then 
press Enter.

70
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.32  To create a copy of any entity, use the Move tool 
and the Copy toggle.
5.	 To create multiple copies at a specified distance, immediately after you complete the 
Move/Copy command, enter the number of copies you want to make—for example, 
type 4x, then press Enter. This will create four copies of the selection in addition to 
the original, just as a copy machine would (Figure 4.33).
Figure 4.33  Create multiple copies at set intervals using 
the multiply array.
Another way to array using the Move tool is to divide the distance between the copies 
(Figure 4.34). After you complete a copy, specify the number of divisions between the two 
copies within the Measurements dialog, as follows:
1.	 Using the Select tool, preselect the entity that you want to copy.

71
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
2.	 Activate the Move tool and click once on the entity (you could start the copy from 
anywhere in the model).
3.	 Tap the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to toggle on the Copy command while you move 
the cursor along an axis, then click again to finish.
4.	 At this point, enter a precise distance into the Measurements dialog—for example, 
type 100', then press Enter.
5.	 Immediately after entering the distance, enter the desired number of divisions 
between the two copies—for instance, type 5/, then press Enter.
Figure 4.34  Use the divide array to create multiple copies at set intervals.
You can continue to modify the copy and array until you start another command. Try 
entering different numbers of copies and different distances, and switch between using mul-
tiply and divide arrays. Once you click on another tool, you will lose the ability to modify the 
array (Figure 4.35). At that point, the new geometry will be just that, geometry. You will need 
to delete or reposition geometry to change the array.
Figure 4.35  You can continue to modify the copy and array until you invoke another 
command.

72
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Auto-fold
If a surface does not have the proper lines, 
or breaks, to fold the surface and allow 
the selection to move on all axes, it can 
stick to another surface. The Auto-fold 
command automatically draws all the lines 
needed to break a surface and allow the 
selected surface to move in any direction 
(Figure 4.36). While performing a move, 
tap the Alt key (command key on Mac) to 
toggle the Auto-fold command on. 
TIP  Don’t use the Auto-fold command as a crutch. Sometimes it can appear to help 
make an entity move where you want it to, but it can actually create off-axis geometry 
that will be problematic later.
Push/Pull Tool
The Push/Pull tool is one of the fastest and easiest ways to generate large amounts of 
geometry. The Push/Pull tool extrudes 2D surfaces into 3D forms, perpendicular to the 
starting face. This means that geometry is typically on axis, or at least perfectly square with 
the starting surface. The Push/Pull tool affects only surfaces. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Position the Push/Pull tool on a surface; it will auto-select the surface. The hot spot 
of the Push/Pull tool is at the tip of the red arrow on the icon. Click on the surface to 
start the operation.
2.	 Move your cursor to push or pull the surface. The surface will extrude perpendicular 
to the starting surface (Figure 4.37). Click again to finish.
3.	 At this point, you can enter a precise dimension, type 5', then press Enter.
Tap the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) before or during any Push/Pull operation to leave a 
copy of the starting face (Figure 4.38). This is a toggle, so tap the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) 
again and the starting face will disappear. In Chapter 17, “Site Analysis: Documenting an 
Existing Building,” you will see how valuable this function is for creating floorplans.
Figure 4.36  Auto-fold in action

73
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Figure 4.37  The Push/Pull tool in action
TIP  The Push/Pull tool has a memory. Once you have completed a Push/Pull 
operation, you can double-click on another surface to reproduce the last push/pull.
Follow Me Tool
The Follow Me tool generates massive amounts of complex geometry with very few clicks. 
This tool works by extruding a 2D profile along a path (Figure 4.39). A path can be a series 
of connected edges, or a surface which defines the path with its bounding edges. Follow 
these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, preselect the path, in this example a surface.
2.	 Activate the Follow Me tool.
3.	 Click on the profile to finish.
TIP  The profile does not have to touch the path for the Follow Me tool to work, 
although the operation and results make more sense and are easier to predict if it does 
touch the path.
Figure 4.38  The Push/Pull tool can leave a 
copy of the starting face behind if desired.

74
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.39  The Follow Me tool in action
Rotate Tool
The Rotate tool spins entities around a defined center point of rotation at a specified angle 
(Figure 4.40). To use it, follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, preselect the entity you want to rotate.
2.	 Activate the Rotate tool. Click and hold at the desired center point of rotation, and 
drag away to set the axis of rotation. Look for the inference line to turn red, green, 
or blue. Release once you have found the desired axis of rotation—for this example, 
rotate about the red axis.
TIP  Use guides or encourage an inference to specify a meaningful center point 
of rotation.
3.	 Move your cursor around and notice that it is locked at the defined center point of 
rotation. Click to define the reference angle. The reference angle can be arbitrary for 
most rotations, unless you are trying to align one object with another.

75
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
4.	 Move your cursor and click again to define the degree of rotation away from the ref-
erence angle. You can click at a random angle, or 
5.	 At this point let go of the mouse and enter a precise angle into the Measurements 
dialog—for example, type 90, then press Enter. This will rotate the object 90 degrees 
off the reference angle around the defined center point of rotation.
Figure 4.40  Use the Rotate tool to spin entities around a specified axis.
Similar to the Move tool, during any rotation, tap the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to toggle 
on the Copy command. This will leave a copy of the selected object behind (Figure 40.41). To 
perform a polar copy and array, follow these steps:
1.	 Pre-select the entity you wish to rotate and copy. Activate the Rotate Tool, hover on 
a point to encourage an inference and use a meaningful starting point.
2.	 Click and drag and release on the blue axis.
3.	 Move your cursor to the right and click once to set the reference line. Tap the Ctrl key 
(Option on Mac) to toggle on the Copy command while you move your cursor down 
the screen.

76
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
4.	 Click to place the copy.
5.	 Immediately type a precise degree of rotation, such as 90, then press Enter.
6.	 To make three copies, immediately type the number of copies as 3x, then press Enter. 
You can continue to change both the degree of rotation and the number of copies 
until you invoke another command.
Figure 4.41  The Rotate tool can create copies and polar arrays.
TIP  Similarly to the way you use the Move tool, you can also enter the overall copy 
rotation and specify divisions. For example, after making a copy type 180, then press 
Enter, immediately type 5/, then press Enter. This will make the original copy at 180 
degrees and fill the space between with five divisions.
Scale Tool
The Scale tool distorts entities based on a scale factor or a “hard” dimension. The hot spot of 
the Scale tool is at the tip of the red arrow, but it usually is best to preselect entities before 
scaling. Follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, preselect the entity you want to scale.

77
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
2.	 Activate the Scale tool and click on the top center grip.
3.	 Move your cursor to scale the object and click to finish the command.
4.	 Immediately enter a scale value, such as 1.5, then press Enter.
5.	 You can also type a precise dimension into the Measurements dialog—for example, 
20', then press Enter. Be sure to specify feet or inches because the Scale Tool defaults 
to a scale value rather than the models default units (Figure 4.42).
Figure 4.42  The Scale tool distorts entities based on a scale 
factor or set dimension.
TIP  The Scale tool also has modifier keys to help you achieve the desired scaling 
effect. Hold the Shift key to toggle between a uniform and nonuniform scale. Hold the 
Ctrl key (Option key on Mac) to scale about the center of the entity.

78
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Offset Tool
The Offset tool concentrically copies a series of connected edges or a surface’s bounding 
edges (Figure 4.43). Follow these steps:
1.	 Use the Select tool to preselect a series of connected coplanar edges, or use the tool’s 
hot spot at the tip of the red arrow to auto-select a surface and offset its bounding 
edges. Hover on an edge to set the starting point.
2.	 Move your cursor to suggest the direction of the offset and let go of the mouse.
3.	 At this point, you can type a precise dimension, such as 2', then press Enter.
Figure 4.43  The Offset tool in action
TIP  The Offset tool also has a memory. You can double-click on another surface or 
series of coplanar lines to reproduce the last offset.
Advanced Inferencing
The inference engine is always running in the background and is there to help keep your 
geometry aligned in accurate and meaningful ways. Mastering inferences is essential to fast 
and efficient drafting in SketchUp. The inferences discussed in this section are advanced 
techniques; becoming familiar with each of these inferences will make you much faster 
at drawing in SketchUp. Try to think of ways to eliminate clicks from your own modeling 
techniques. Often, inferences can eliminate guides and clicks. Many of the following 
inferences work with both the Drawing tools and the Move tool.

79
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
TIP  The inference engine cannot be turned off, but why would you want to? Once you 
master the available inferences, you will wonder how you ever lived without advanced 
inferences.
Multiple Points
You can encourage an inference from a point, a midpoint, or even two points (Figure 4.44). 
Follow these steps:
1.	 With the Line tool active, hover on an endpoint until you see the Endpoint notifica-
tion. When you see the notification, the edge is loaded into the inference engine. 
Move your cursor away from the point and you will see a dotted inference line repre-
senting the axis it is on.
2.	 Hover on another endpoint until 
you see the Endpoint notification. 
When you see the notification, the 
edge is loaded into the inference 
engine. Move your cursor away 
from the point and you will see 
two dotted inference lines project-
ing from the two inferenced points.
3.	 Click where the inference lines 
meet to start the line at a mean-
ingful point. Now you can go on 
to encourage more inferences and 
click to finish.
Parallel to Edge
Draw parallel to an existing edge by encouraging a Parallel to Edge inference (Figure 4.45). 
Follow these steps:
1.	 Click once to start a line.
2.	 Position your cursor on the edge to which you want to draw a line parallel. Wait for 
the On Edge inference to appear; this lets you know that SketchUp loaded that edge 
into the inference engine.
Figure 4.44  Encouraging two inference points to use a 
meaningful starting point

80
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
3.	 Position you cursor roughly parallel to the edge. The active line will turn magenta and 
you will see the Parallel to Edge notification appear. At this point you can hold down 
the Shift key to lock the inference.
4.	 Position your cursor over a point, edge, or surface to specify the distance and click 
to finish.
Figure 4.45  A Parallel to Edge inference
Constrained on Line
The Edge Constrained inference allows you to either start or finish an operation along a 
specific edge (Figure 4.46). Follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Line tool, hover on an edge. When you see the On Edge inference, hold 
down the Shift key.
2.	 Move your cursor off of the existing geometry and notice that the starting point is 
constrained on the edge. Click to start the line.
3.	 Hover on another edge. Once you see the On Edge inference, hold down the Shift key 
to constrain the next point along that edge.
4.	 Click to finish the line.

81
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Figure 4.46  A constrained inference on a line
TIP  You can also constrain an operation on a surface by first hovering on the surface 
and then holding the Shift key. This will limit any line that you draw to be coplanar with 
the inferred surface. Constrained inferences, both edge and surface, are especially 
helpful when you’re working out complex roofs in three dimensions.
Line Intersect
Use the Line Intersect inference to take the place of guides and project intersections 
between lines (Figure 4.47). Follow these steps:
1.	 To encourage the inference, use the Line tool to hover on an endpoint until you see 
the Endpoint inference notification.
Figure 4.47  The Line Intersect inference

82
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Move your cursor down away from the Endpoint on the green axis and click to set 
the starting point.
3.	 Move your cursor to the left until you find the red axis. Once the active line turns 
red, hold down the Shift key to lock the axis.
4.	 Position you cursor on the angled line. The endpoint of the line has been projected to 
the intersection of the locked axis and the inferenced edge. Click to finish.
Organizing Geometry with Containers
SketchUp has two basic containers for geometry: groups and components (Figure 4.48). 
These containers not only separate edges to control stickiness, but also organize entities 
and geometry to make more efficient models. Groups are unintelligent containers that have 
no connection between copies. Groups simply hold geometry. Components on the other 
hand have intelligence in that each instance is connected. If any instance of a component is 
modified, all instances of the same component reflect those changes as well.
Figure 4.48  Components are intelligent; groups are not.
TIP  In this book, the term container refers to both groups and components.
Groups
Groups are unintelligent containers that simply hold geometry (Figure 4.49). If you make a 
copy of a group, there will be no connection between the original and the new copy. Almost 
every object should be made into a group. It is almost impossible to make too many groups.  

83
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Groups are mainly used to contain entities,  
form a hierarchy of layers, and control the  
stickiness of geometry.
The organization techniques utilized during 
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture require 
advanced layering and organization of groups. 
Model organization diagrams (Figure 4.50) 
are used to complement the text and further 
explain layering and grouping.
Creating a Group
To create a group, follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, select at least 
two entities (edges, surfaces, groups, or 
components).
2.	 Right-click on the selection and choose Make Group, or click on the Edit drop-down 
menu and choose Make Group.
Figure 4.50  A simple group Model Organization Diagram
Figure 4.49  Groups can hold any entity 
created in SketchUp. When selected, 
both groups and components highlight 
with a blue bounding box.

84
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Components
Unlike groups, components are intelligent containers. They hold geometry just as groups do, 
but there is a linkage between all copies of a component. Suppose you make a component 
and then copy it several times throughout a model. If you edit any one instance of a 
component, all instances of that component will update simultaneously to reflect those 
changes (Figure 4.51).
Components are used to make extremely efficient models. When you see repeating ele-
ments, similar elements, and lines of symmetry, you should think component.
Figure 4.51  Any changes to the contents of a component are 
reflected in all instances of that component.
TIP  A component's behavior is similar to a block in CAD, or a smart object in Adobe 
Photoshop.
Creating a Component
To create a component, follow these steps 
(Figure 4.52):
1.	 Using the Select tool, select at least two 
entities.
2.	 Right-click on the selection and choose 
Make Component.
3.	 In the Create Component dialog, assign 
the desired properties and choose Create.
Figure 4.52  The Create Component dialog

85
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
TIP  If you are making a copy of a group, it should most likely be made into a component 
first. To change a group into a component, right-click on the group and choose Make 
Component. It is easier to make a group first, and then choose Make Component because 
this method bypasses the often unnecessary Create Component dialog.
Making Unique Components
The Make Unique command is used for similar elements. It is similar to a Save Copy As 
command in other programs. The original component instance(s) are left connected and intact, 
and a new component instance is created based on the selected component (Figure 4.53). 
To make a component, or multiple components unique, select them, then right-click on the 
selection and choose “Make Unique.”
Figure 4.53  Once a component or selection of components is made 
unique, the components are independent of the original instance 
and are connected only to each other.

86
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Navigating Containers
The ability to quickly move in and out of containers is essential to fast and efficient 
modeling in SketchUp. The first way to navigate containers is slow and methodical. Use this 
method when you’re first learning to navigate containers; it is easy to understand which 
container level of the model you are in. Follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click on a container and choose Edit Group or Edit Component, depending on 
which type of container you are editing.
2.	 To close the container, right-click outside of the container bounding box and choose 
Close Group or Close Component.
A much faster method for navigating containers utilizes the Select tool. Use the Select 
tool method for navigating containers after you have a solid understanding of which con-
tainer level of the model you are in. Follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, double-click on a container to move in one level (Figure 4.54).
2.	 To close the container, press the Esc key to back out while the Select tool is active. 
You can also click outside the bounding box of the container to back out one level.
Figure 4.54  Use the Select tool to select entities and navigate quickly in and out of 
containers.
The Outliner shows a file-structure-type diagram of the contents of your model to help 
you find your way through the various container levels (Figure 4.55). To open the Outliner, 
click on the Window drop-down menu and choose Outliner. Click on entity names in the 
Outliner to select them. Double-click or right-click on containers within the Outliner to 
navigate in and out of the container.

87
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Figure 4.55  The Outliner
The Outliner is very helpful when all the groups and components in your model are accu-
rately named. Groups and components can be named using the Entity Info dialog. To open 
the Entity Info dialog, click on the Window drop-down menu and select Entity Info (Fig-
ure 4.56). Then, use the Select tool to select an entity; its properties will be displayed in the 
Entity Info dialog where they can be edited. Make sure to assign logical names. For instance, 
if a group contains walls, name the group WALLS.
Figure 4.56  The Entity Info dialog displays any entity's properties.

88
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Modifying Containers
Containers in SketchUp, including groups and more importantly components, can be 
modified without affecting the contents of the container. For instance, you can move and 
rotate a container without affecting the contents of the container. Remember, if you were 
to move or rotate the contents of a component, all instances would reflect that change. 
Rotating and moving are fairly easy concepts to grasp, but there are also more abstract 
ideas related to modifying containers covered in this section. In this section, you will learn 
to make components (and groups) different without actually affecting the contents of the 
component.
Move Tool
Use the Move tool to reposition containers exactly the same way you would reposition 
edges and surfaces. The Move tool also auto-selects entire containers and offers a rotate 
option (Figure 4.57). Just follow these steps:
1.	 Deselect all entities by right-clicking on the background, activate the Move tool 
and hover over a container. The Move tool auto-selects the container and displays 
red crosses on each side that you 
hover on.
2.	 Hover on one of the red crosses 
and you will see the Rotate tool 
positioned at the center of the 
container. Click once to start the 
rotation.
3.	 Move your cursor to rotate the con-
tainer, then click again to define the 
actual rotation of the container.
4.	 At this point, you can enter a pre-
cise degree of rotation by typing 
135, then press Enter.
Figure 4.57  Auto-select a component with the 
Move tool and rotate. The contents of the con-
tainer will not be modified.

89
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Scale Tool
The Scale tool allows you to stretch and distort geometry, as well as containers. Scaling 
a container does not affect the contents of the container, so these changes will not be 
reflected in all instances of the component (Figure 4.58).
Figure 4.58  The effects of scaling on the component container

90
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
To create a line of symmetry, use the Scale tool and assign a scale factor of –1 to mirror 
the component (Figure 4.59).
Figure 4.59  Copying and mirroring a component creates a line of 
symmetry, but does not modify the contents of the container.
TIP  Scaling to –1 does the same thing as the Flip Along command; however, the Scale 
tool is more visual and therefore easier to use. If you do choose to use the Flip Along 
command, you can access it by right-clicking on an entity and choosing Flip Along. 
Then you will have to define the axis along which you want to flip.
Default Material
Any surface in a container that has the default material applied to it will take on the material 
of its parent (Figure 4.60). In other words, suppose there is a cube (six surfaces) in a container 
that has the default material applied to each surface. If you paint the outside of the group 

91
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
with a material, all the surfaces in the group will take on that material. This default material 
can be overridden by applying a different material to the actual surface in the group.
Figure 4.60  The default material is applied to every edge and surface that 
is created. Any surfaces in a container with the default material applied to 
them will take on the material applied to the “outside” of the container.
By leveraging the default material behaviors, you can have components that have effi-
ciently linked geometry but display different materials. This characteristic can come into play 
when you use repeating elements that need to be slightly different. For example, you could 
have a chair component that is efficiently linked, but has a different colored cushion.
TIP  At some point, you may try to right-click on a surface with a material applied to 
it and not see the Texture menu. If this happens, you are probably actually clicking on 
a surface that has the default material applied to it, within a group that has a texture 
image material applied to the outside of it. You can fix this by applying the desired 
texture image material directly to the surface.
Nested Containers
Nested containers are containers within containers within containers (Figure 4.61). There is 
virtually no limit to the number of “levels” deep your model can be. Mastering the concept 
of nested containers is essential to organizing for The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture.
Select any two containers, right-click on the selection and choose Make Group or Make 
Component, depending on the desired container.

92
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.61  A group and a component are shown 
nested within a group.
The need for nested containers depends on layering, repeating elements, and lines of 
symmetry. The organization techniques utilized during The SketchUp Workflow for Archi-
tecture require advanced layering and organization of nested containers, groups, and com-
ponents. Model organization diagrams (Figure 4.62) are used to complement the text and 
further explain these layering and grouping strategies.
Figure 4.62  Nested containers are graphically displayed in this book 
using this diagram.

93
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Explode
The Explode command could also be called the “Un-Container” tool. Right-click on a group 
or component and choose Explode to remove the container. Keep in mind that when a 
container is exploded, all entities previously within the container take on the layer previously 
applied to the exploded container.
Section Planes
The best way to open up a model and look inside is to use section planes. A section in 
SketchUp does not delete or modify geometry in any way; it simply hides geometry in front 
of the section plane. Follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Section Plane tool.
2.	 Position the section plane on a face that is parallel to the desired section’s cut direc-
tion (Figure 4.63a).
Figure 4.63a  The section plane orients itself parallel to the face you are hovering on.
3.	 Once you find the proper section orientation hold the Shift key to constrain it.
4.	 Continue holding the Shift key until you click again to place the section cut. You will 
now see the section plane hiding all geometry in front of it (Figure 4.63b).
Figure 4.63b  An active section plane hides all entities behind it.

94
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Once a section cut is placed, it can be reversed, moved, rotated, copied, deleted, acti-
vated, and deactivated. Right-click on a section plane to access a helpful context menu. The 
Reverse command will flip the section plane to point the opposite direction. Check Active 
Cut on and off to activate and deactivate the section plane. Select Create Group from Slice 
to generate a group containing the 2D linework of the section cut.
Only one section plane can be active at a time in each level of a model. If you want to 
have multiple section cuts, you must separate them into containers (Figure 4.64, Figure 4.65).
Figure 4.64  You can have more than one 
active section planes by separating them into 
containers.
Figure 4.65  A Model Organization Diagram repre-
senting two active section planes separated by a 
container

Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Layers, Styles, and Scenes
Layers, styles, and scenes are all related. Layers control the visibility of entities within 
SketchUp. Styles control the way in which entities are displayed in SketchUp. Layers and 
styles attach to scenes. So, by clicking on a scene, you can jump to a preset state for layers 
and styles, as well as several other properties that can be attached to scenes.
By mastering layers, styles, and scenes, you will gain full control over any drawing you 
want to create and you will become a faster modeler. In this section, you will learn the basic 
functions and operations of these features, and how they relate to each other. Later in this 
book, you will flex these features and leverage them to make more efficient models, presen-
tations, and construction documents.
Layers
SketchUp layers are different than layers in many other 3D and 2D programs—but in a 
good way. SketchUp layers are simple. There is no stacking of layers in SketchUp, so the 
order in which layers are displayed in the Layers dialog has nothing to do with the way in 
which geometry is displayed in your SketchUp model. Layers can be assigned to any entity in 
SketchUp, including edges, surfaces, groups, and components. You are only able to control 
whether or not a layer is visible and the color of the layer when on a color-by-layer style. 
That’s it!
Click on the Window drop-down menu and choose Layers. The Layers dialog is where 
you set the current layer, visible layers, and layer colors; it is also where you add, delete, and 
rename layers (Figure 4.66).
Figure 4.66  The Layers dialog

96
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
The current layer, defined by the dot to the left of the layer name, should always be set 
to Layer0. Layer0 cannot be deleted or renamed. Any entity created within or added to the 
model will be assigned to the current layer, Layer0. It is possible to change the current layer, 
but doing so is not advisable. The workflow presented in this book requires that all edges 
and surfaces be drawn on Layer0. So, it is best to always leave Layer0 as the current layer. To 
work with layers, follow these simple guidelines:
☑
☑To add a layer, click on the plus sign (+) in the top-left corner of the Layers dialog. Once 
a new layer is created, you can immediately rename the layer by typing over the blue 
highlighted text and pressing Enter to finish.
☑
☑To rename a layer, double-click on the layer name and type over the blue highlighted text, 
then press Enter to finish.
☑
☑To delete a layer, first click on the layer name to select it. Then, click on the minus 
sign (–) in the top-left corner of the Layers window to delete it. If there are entities on 
the layer you are deleting, you will be asked “What to do with the entities.”
☑
☑Click on a layer’s color swatch to change it. A layer’s color will only show when on a 
color-by-layer style.
☑
☑Click on the check box next to a layer in the Visible column to toggle the layer’s visibility 
on and off.
☑
☑To organize the list of layers by name, 
visibility, or color, click on the headings 
at the top of the columns.
☑
☑To assign an entity to a layer, right-
click on the entity and choose Entity 
Info. Within the Entity Info dialog box, 
click on the Layers drop-down menu 
and choose a different layer. A Layers 
toolbar is available by clicking on the 
View drop-down menu and choosing 
Toolbars c Layers. The Layers toolbar 
works the same way as the Layer drop-
down menu in the Entity Info dialog 
(Figure 4.67).
Once the Entity Info dialog and the Layers toolbar are open, you can simply select an 
entity and adjust its layer in one of these dialogs. There is no need to right-click on the entity 
every time.
Figure 4.67  Entity Info and the Layers toolbar

97
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Styles
Styles provide a different way to look at your model. Styles do not affect geometry; they 
are simply a unique set of lenses for looking at your model. You can make the model edges 
sketchy, change the color of the sky, make all faces render as the same color, and use many 
other attractive visual settings without actually affecting any edges or surfaces.
To open the Styles browser, click on the Window drop-down menu and choose Styles. 
Within the Styles browser, you can select from preloaded styles by clicking on the Libraries 
drop-down menu (Figure 4.68). Once you find a style you like, click on it.
Figure 4.68  The Styles browser’s Select tab
To change the properties of a style, click on the Edit tab. Five boxes in the Edit tab represent 
Edge, Face, Background, Watermark, and Modeling settings (Figure 4.69). Try changing a few of 
the settings and see how the display properties of the geometry in your model are affected.

98
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.69  The Styles browser’s Edit tab with all five views
Changing any of the Style properties means that the style is now out of date. A “recycle” 
watermark will appear on the active style’s thumbnail image. In order to save any changes 
you’ve made, you must update the style by clicking on the Style thumbnail or on the Refresh 
button in the Style browser (Figure 4.70). If any property of a style is changed, the style must 
be updated to save the changes.
Figure 4.70  Update a style by clicking on the 
active style’s thumbnail, or by clicking on the 
Update Style button.
Use the Mix tab to make your own unique Style creations. See “Chapter 7: SketchUp Col-
lections” for more information on using the Mix tab.
TIP  It is possible to change many of the Style settings using drop-down menus. 
For instance, if you click on View c Axes and turn off the Axes, that is actually a Style 
setting. You must be aware and update the style within the Styles browser if you want 
to save that change.

99
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Scenes
Scenes are most often associated with a camera. In other words, most people assume that 
a scene is just like a bookmark for a specific view of your model. This is true, but scenes 
also save many other properties in addition to the camera location. Scenes can also save 
hidden geometry, visible layers, active section planes, style and fog, shadow settings, and axes 
locations. By creating complex scenes, you can create any rendering, drawing, or diagram 
that you need.
Take a look at the Scenes browser by clicking on the Window drop-down menu and 
selecting Scenes. The Scenes browser is where you will add, name, delete, and update the 
scenes in your model (Figure 4.71).
Figure 4.71  The Scenes browser
In the Scenes browser, you can see that scenes have a name, description, and properties 
to save. The name of a scene will appear in the Scene browser as well as on the correspond-
ing Scene tab at the top of the screen. The description of a scene, which is usually unneces-
sary, is displayed in the Scene browser and also when you hover your cursor over a Scene 
tab. The Properties to Save are the critical attributes of scenes (Figure 4.72). The check boxes 
next to the properties control whether or not the selected scene will hold onto the named 
settings. For example, if the Camera Location property is not checked on to be saved, there 
will be no camera location information associated with that scene.

100
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Frequently, the Properties to Save are confused with the Properties to Update. Remember, 
99 percent of the time you will want all of the Properties to Save checked on, and you will 
never need to touch them again once the scene is created. When you want to modify the 
scene, click on the Refresh button and check and uncheck the desired Properties to Update.
Figure 4.72  The Properties to Save and Properties to Update 
are easily confused. Make sure you understand the function 
of each.
Similar to styles, scenes also need to be updated if you want to save any changes to 
the scene. The tricky thing about scenes is that there is no visual cue that that tells you the 
scene needs to be updated.
Typically, the only time you would uncheck certain properties within the Properties to 
Update dialog is when you are applying aspects of one scene to another scene. For instance, 
to match the camera view from one scene to another, first go to the scene with the desired 
camera view by clicking on its scene tab. Then click on the scene you want to have the 
same camera view within the Scenes dialog. Click on the Update Scene button and uncheck 

101
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
everything but the Camera Location in the Properties to Update dialog. Click on Update 
and the two scenes will have the same camera location.
Combining Layers, Styles, and Scenes
By combining layers, styles, and scenes, you can completely control a model. Experiment 
with all of the settings shown in the following diagrams until you have fully mastered them 
(Figure 4.73, Figure 4.74).
Keep these tips in mind when you’re working with layers, styles, and scenes:
☑
☑When you’re creating scenes, it is usually best to change all of the desired settings so that 
your screen looks the way you want the scene to look. Then you add the scene to take a 
digital “snapshot” of the settings that make the screen look that way.
☑
☑If you decide to change a property that is saved within a style, you will need to update 
the style. You do not need to update the scene after making changes to a style if the 
style is already attached to the scene.
☑
☑When you’re creating a scene, most of the time you will want to have all of the Proper-
ties to Save checked on. After checking them on, there is almost never any reason to go 
back and uncheck them.
☑
☑If a Property to Save is unchecked, that property won’t be saved with the scene. For instance, 
if the camera location is unchecked, then no matter how many times you click on that 
scene or update it, it will not take you back to a camera view. The camera location must be 
checked on in Properties to Save in order for the scene to remember the camera location.
☑
☑If you decide to change a property that is saved by a scene, and you want the scene to 
reflect those changes, you will need to update the scene. Typically, it is safest to make 
the adjustments, click on the Update button, then uncheck all properties in the Proper-
ties to Update dialog, except the properties that you have changed.
☑
☑If you need to modify the properties of a scene, you’ll be better able to keep track of 
what you’re doing if you first click on the Scene tab to see all of the Scene settings visu-
ally presented on your screen. Make only the changes that you want, and then right-click 
on the Scene tab and choose Update to update all of the properties at the same time. 
This can be dangerous if you don’t completely understand how to use scenes, but it will 
ultimately save you time because you’ll avoid the Properties to Update dialog and all of 
the checking and unchecking.

102
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 4.73  A scene’s properties are stored with the scene. To save any 
changes you make to the listed properties, you must update the scene.
Chapter Points
☑
☑SketchUp is a surface modeler, which means its basic building blocks are edges and sur-
faces. All shapes in SketchUp are composed of edges and surfaces; there are no true solid 
shapes such as spheres, cubes, and cylinders.
☑
☑Inferencing and axis locking allow you to interact with the 3D SketchUp environment 
effectively through your 2D computer screen.
☑
☑Typically, you should start with a Drawing tool that adds surfaces, such as the Rectangle 
tool, Polygon tool, or Circle tool.
☑
☑Use Drawing tools that only add edges to set up slight additive and subtractive adjustments.
☑
☑Use the Modification tools to turn simple forms into complex geometry.

103
Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics
Figure 4.74  Styles have several properties that are controlled through the 
Styles browser. If a property of a style is changed, the style must be updated.
☑
☑When you’re creating components, look for repeating elements. If you need a similar ele-
ment, use the Make Unique command. Mirror a component container using the Scale 
tool or Flip Along command to create lines of symmetry.
☑
☑Layers, styles, and scenes are absolutely necessary for creating a useful SketchUp model. 
To avoid frustration in later chapters, you should explore these combined concepts until 
you completely understand how they work before you proceed.
☑
☑The best way to learn about layers, styles, and scenes is to review this chapter while play-
ing around with their settings. Don’t be afraid to make a copy of a model and mess it up 
by experimenting.

Chapter 5
The Professional’s 
SketchUp Template
S
ketchUp provides several default templates that are excellent to 
use for learning, but ultimately not fit for professional use. Your 
default template in SketchUp should do more than just paint a pretty 
picture; it should also make modeling easier and reveal deeper levels 
of information stored within your model. You can customize your own 
SketchUp template by optimizing the model settings, creating utility 
scenes and styles, and adding default layers that will fit any design 
project.

105
Base Template
Start by opening SketchUp. If you see the Welcome to SketchUp window, uncheck the 
Always Show on Startup box in the bottom-left corner of the window (Figure 5.1). The 
Welcome to SketchUp window is designed to introduce first-time users to SketchUp and is 
not necessary for a professional. Close the Welcome to SketchUp window by clicking on the 
Start Using SketchUp button.
To select a template, click on the Window 
(SketchUp on Mac) drop-down menu and 
choose Preferences, then click on the Template 
tab. Find the Plan View – Feet and Inches tem-
plate, click on it, and choose OK.
Click on the File drop-down menu and 
choose New to start a new model using the 
Plan View – Feet and Inches template. To see 
the new template, you will always need to start 
a new file. This template starts off in a clean 
white background, and the default units are 
inches. Now that you have selected a stock 
default template, you are going to customize it 
and save it as your own default template. Click 
on the File drop-down menu and choose save, 
navigate to your RESOURCES/TEMPLATES 
folder and name the file BIC_Default  
Template.skp.
Model Info
The Model Info settings travel with your model. In this section, you will modify only the 
settings that will help make your modeling faster and more efficient. Keep in mind that all of 
the Model Info settings can be changed once a new model is started. To get started, click on 
the Window drop-down menu and choose Model Info.
Animation
Unless you are creating an animation, you won’t need to see scene transitions while you’re 
designing in SketchUp. Sure, they look cool, but they also kill a couple of seconds every time 
Figure 5.1  The Welcome to SketchUp 
Window offers links to learning resources, 
licensing information, and the default 
template. All of this information and more 
is available in the Help menu and at 
SketchUp.com.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
you change to a different scene. As a professional, you need instant information, so go to the 
Animation tab and uncheck the Enable Scene Transitions check box (Figure 5.2).
Figure 5.2  The Animation tab in the Model Info window
Dimensions
Dimensions are best shown in LayOut, where you have full control of placement, size, scale, 
font, and style. In some instances, you may find it help ful to add dimensions to a quick 
sketch in SketchUp. When you’re adding dimensions in SketchUp, make sure to apply your 
own style to set your presentations apart from other SketchUp users. Choose your font style 
and size from the Dimensions tab (Figure 5.4). Also choose your favorite arrow type and 
alignment.
When there is not enough room 
to clearly display the dimensions, you 
can use the Expert Dimension settings 
to control whether or not to display 
them. Typically, there is no “best” 
default setting for the Expert Dimen-
sion settings. You should modify the 
settings on a case-by-case basis.
Figure 5.4  The Dimensions settings

Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
Rendering
Enabling anti-aliased textures may speed up SketchUp’s performance (Figure 5.5).
Figure 5.5  The Rendering settings
Text
Similar to dimensions, text annotations are preferably added within LayOut; although 
they are not used nearly as much within SketchUp, you can still customize the text style 
within SketchUp. Set your favorite font within the Text tab, which will probably match the 
Dimensions Text settings (Figure 5.6).
Figure 5.6  The Text tab in the Model Info window

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Units
The default units are set to inches in the Plan View – Feet and Inches template. By thinking 
in terms of inches, you can save time while you are modeling. For example, to draw a line 
at five-feet-six-inches long, rather than typing 5f6g and pressing the Enter key, you can just 
type 66 and press Enter. In this case, by thinking in inches, you cut the number of keystrokes 
in half. Saving three keystrokes may not seem significant, but think of the hundreds of 
commands you perform in an hour when you are using SketchUp.
The Model’s Precision setting indicates the number of units that will display in the Mea-
surements dialog box. The Model’s Precision setting can be overridden by entering a precise 
dimension into the Measurements dialog box during an operation. For example, if the model’s 
accuracy is set to 1/8g, and you enter a dimension that ends in 1/64g, that line will actually be 
drawn to the 1/64g, but when measured will be rounded to the nearest 1/8g because of the 
precision setting. Typically, a Model’s Precision is set to the most accurate setting of 1/64g.
TIP  Professionals should always have the model accuracy set to the highest 
tolerance of 1/64g (Figure 5.7). It is important that the model itself has the most 
precise dimensions possible. Then, if necessary, you can use less precise dimensions 
in LayOut to clean up fractional dimensions for schematic presentations. Once you 
begin a model, do not change the Precision setting.
Figure 5.7  The Units tab in the Model Info window
Length snapping limits the dimensions of an object drawn in SketchUp to predefined 
intervals. Enabling length snapping is the best way to keep your dimensions clean. For exam-
ple, when designing on a very loose preliminary sketch of a site plan or building footprint, 

109
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
you might set the length snapping to 6g or 12g to keep the dimensions round and clean. If 
you are designing with masonry block, set the length snapping to 8” to design within the 
limitations of the material. By entering precise dimensions in the Measurements dialog box, 
you can override length snapping during any operation.
Standard Layers
A logical set of layers will help you keep a model organized, which will prove helpful when 
you are exporting backgrounds for consultants, moving to other CAD programs, rendering 
with a photorealistic plugin, and creating construction documents in LayOut. Figure 5.8 
displays a list of standard layers used to create SketchUp models with these tasks in mind. 
These are the official layers of The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture. Note that the 
layers are organized into three categories: CONCEPTUAL, ARCHITECTURAL, and SITE. 
ARCHITECTURAL and SITE layers are nouns, often named after actual physical objects. 
CONCEPTUAL layers are adjectives that describe the ARCHITECTURAL and SITE layers. 
CONCEPTUAL layers are more abstract and intangible.
You’ll learn more about how and where to apply these layers later in this book. Right 
now it is important to create your customized default template and workspace so that later 
everything will flow easily. Add these layers to your template now. Assign a green to the 
CONC - New layer and assign a gray to the CONC - Existing layer. All other layers can be 
assigned the color black, or disregarded.
Now save your SketchUp model into the ACTIVE PROJECTS/RESOURCES/Templates 
folder. These new files need to be saved shortly after you first start them. SketchUp’s auto-
save feature will not kick in until you have saved the model once yourself.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Styles
If you have used SketchUp for even a small amount of time, you probably have explored the 
enticing visual effects offered by styles. Styles allow you to completely alter the appearance of 
your model without affecting the underlying geometry. For instance, you can add sketchy lines, 
blueprint colored faces, canvas watermarks, and different color backgrounds without modifying 
any geometry or materials. These are all great visual effects you can use for presentations, but 
you’ll pay the price by slowing down your computer when using complex styles.
What if a style could also do the opposite, increase computer performance by turning off the 
resource-hogging visual features? In this way, styles can also be used as a tool rather than just 
an attractive visual effect. Styles control properties that can make your models easier to work 
on, optimize your system’s performance, 
and visually communicate deeper levels 
of information stored within the model 
(Figure 5.9). In the next section, you will 
explore styles by creating several util-
ity and presentation styles, including 
DESIGN, LINE DRAWING, PRESENTA-
TION, COLOR BY AXIS, COLOR BY FACE, 
and COLOR BY LAYER. After you create 
the styles, you will combine them with 
the power of scenes to make your time-
saving default template complete.
DESIGN Style
The DESIGN style turns off all of the bells and whistles that make SketchUp models look 
great but at the same time heavily tax the processor and graphics card, thereby slowing the 
system. When working on a model, you want to be fast and effective. It is important to have 
a default state where you know your machine is going to perform its best. This optimized 
default state will utilize the DESIGN utility style.
Click on the Create New Style button to add a new style to your template model and 
name it “DESIGN”. Click on the Edit tab and adjust the settings as shown in Figure 5.10. Click 
on the Update button to save the changes and the watermark will go away, indicating that 
everything has been saved. The DESIGN utility style is complete.
Figure 5.9  Styles being used as Modeling and Presentation 
tools

111
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
Figure 5.10  The DESIGN style settings
LINE DRAWING Style
The LINE DRAWING style presents all geometry in simple black lines on a white background. 
This style is ideal for creating CAD-type 2D output as typically seen in construction 
documents.
Click on the Create New Style button to add a new style to your template model and 
name it LINE DRAWING. Click on the Edit tab and adjust the settings as shown in Fig-
ure 5.11. Click on the Update button to save the changes and the watermark will go away, 
indicating that everything has been saved. The LINE DRAWING utility style is complete.
Figure 5.11  The LINE DRAWING style settings

112
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
PRESENTATION Style
The PRESENTATION style is the opposite of the DESIGN style in that it turns on all of the 
desired visual bells and whistles. The PRESENTATION settings typically utilize sketchy edges 
and more complicated effects for a final rendering. Start with what is shown here, then get 
creative and make your own PRESENTATION style.
Click on the create new style button to add a new style to your template model and 
and name it PRESENTATION. Click on the Edit tab and adjust the settings as shown in Fig-
ure 5.12. Click on the Update button to save the changes and the watermark will go away, 
indicating that everything has been saved. The PRESENTATION utility style is complete.
Figure 5.12  The PRESENTATION style settings
TIP  You can also use the Mix tab to drag and drop your favorite properties into the 
current style. Once you are satisfied, be sure to click on the Update button to update 
the style. See Chapter 7 “SketchUp Collections”, Creating a Style section, for more 
information on using the Mix tab..
COLOR BY AXIS Style
The COLOR BY AXIS style can help you troubleshoot a problematic model. If you are tracing 
lines and a surface will not reheal, often the problem is an edge that is off axis. By switching 
to the COLOR BY AXIS utility style, all of the edges will be colored by the same as the axis 
the edge is parallel to and all surfaces will be white. It will become immediately clear which 
lines are causing the problem because any off axis edge will be black.

113
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
Click on the create new style button to add a new style to your template model and 
name it COLOR BY AXIS. Click on the Edit tab and adjust the settings as shown in Fig-
ure 5.13. Click the Update button to save the changes and the watermark will go away, indi-
cating that everything has been saved. The COLOR BY AXIS utility style is complete.
Figure 5.13  The COLOR BY AXIS style settings
COLOR BY FACE Style
The COLOR BY FACE utility style displays the geometry of the side of the surface that is 
showing, the front or the back. Viewing geometry in this way will help you prepare a model 
for photorealistic rendering.
Click on the create new style button to add a new style to your template model and 
name it COLOR BY FACE. Click on the Edit tab and adjust the settings as shown in Fig-
ure 5.14. Click on the Update button to save the changes and the watermark will go away, 
indicating that everything has been saved. The COLOR BY FACE utility style is complete.
Figure 5.14  The COLOR BY FACE style settings

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
COLOR BY LAYER Style
The COLOR BY LAYER utility style displays geometry according to the color assigned to 
the geometry’s layer. Viewing geometry in this way will visually show you deeper levels of 
information stored in your model’s layers.
Click on the create new style button to add a new style to your template model  and 
name it COLOR BY LAYER. Click on the Edit tab and adjust the settings as shown in Fig-
ure 5.15. Click on the Update button to save the changes and the watermark will go away, 
indicating that everything has been saved. The COLOR BY LAYER utility style is complete.
Figure 5.15  The COLOR BY LAYER style settings
See www.suexch.com for additional styles that you might want to make, but don't 
necessarily want to attach to a utility scene—for example, Hatch-50, Hatch-25, 
Hatch-75, Hatch-100, Line Drawing-50, Line Drawing-Red, and Mask.
ACTIVITY
Utility Scenes
Styles are helpful by themselves, but the ability to attach a style—along with layer states and 
many other settings—to a scene, means that all of these settings are readily available through 
the Scene tabs at the top of your screen. Utility scenes are the core of a professional’s 
template. Utility scenes are included in a template and used as a tool, rather than merely a 
visually attractive presentation view (Figure 5.16).

115
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
Figure 5.16  The utility scenes
Using scenes, you have the ability to control properties such as camera location, hidden 
geometry, visible layers, active section planes, fog, shadow settings, axes locations, and most 
importantly styles. You can combine the best features of both scenes and styles to make an 
extremely useful and efficient template and get the most out of your model.
TIP  In the Scenes window, you can determine whether or not to use thumbnail 
images. Click on the context arrow at the top-right corner of the Scenes window 
and uncheck Use Scene Thumbnails. Scene thumbnails can be helpful at times, but 
generating them requires extra rendering time and computer resources and you do not 
need them.
Layer State Scenes
Layer state scenes save only the visible layers within scene’s properties to save. They are the 
switches that turn on and turn off the information you want to view. Click on the Add 
Scene button in the scenes dialog, then adjust the settings for each of the utility scenes.
The ALL ON utility scene makes all layers visible (Figure 5.17).
Figure 5.17  The ALL ON scene properties and layers

116
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
The ALL OFF utility scene makes all layers invisible (Figure 5.18).
Figure 5.18  The ALL OFF scene properties and layers
The INTERIOR utility scene turns on the layers and, in turn, the geometry that relates to 
the inside of a building (Figure 5.19). This is helpful for working on the plan without having 
exterior walls blocking your view of the interior.
Figure 5.19  The INTERIOR scene properties and layers
The EXTERIOR utility scene turns on the layers and, in turn, the geometry that relates 
to the outside of a building (Figure 5.20). This is helpful for designing the exterior eleva-
tions without having the site and interior of the model turned on, thereby slowing your 
computer.

117
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
Figure 5.20  The EXTERIOR scene properties and layers
The SITE utility scene turns on the geometry that relates to the outside of a building and 
the site (Figure 5.21). This is helpful for working on the landscape plan without having the 
interior of the model turned on, thereby slowing your computer.
Figure 5.21  The SITE scene properties and layers
Presentation Scenes
Presentation scenes are used to display the model in a final format, either in print or on 
screen. Typically, you will use these scenes before you create additional scenes to send to 
LayOut.
The DESIGN utility scene combines the settings of the DESIGN utility style with 
additional performance-enhancing settings of scenes (Figure 5.22). Use this utility scene 
when you’re working on the model and navigating a model in real time for on-screen 
presentations. 

118
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 5.22  The DESIGN utility scene properties
The 3D PERSPECTIVE utility scene sets the view to the desired final-presentation state 
(Figure 5.23). Typically, this scene is determined by your personal presentation preferences. 
Don’t hesitate to modify the suggested settings.
Figure 5.23  The 3D PERSPECTIVE scene properties, layers,  
and active style
TIP  When you’re creating an interior scene, brighten up the ceilings with Shadow 
settings. Set the Light slider to 20 and the Dark slider to 100. Set the time of day to 
noon and make sure the Use Sun for Shading check box is checked. These settings 
eliminate the “gray ceiling effect” often seen in interior SketchUp renderings.
The 2D DRAWING scene switches to the LINE DRAWING style to display the geometry 
as black lines on a white background (Figure 5.24). This scene is also determined by your per-
sonal preference for creating CAD-type output.

119
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template

Diagrammatic Scenes
Diagrammatic scenes display the model in ways that visually communicate more information.
The AXIS CHECK utility scene can help you troubleshoot a problematic model (Fig-
ure 5.25). If you are tracing lines and a surface will not reheal, the problem is frequently an 
edge that is off axis. When you switch to the AXIS CHECK utility scene, all of the edges will 
be colored by axis and all of the surfaces will be white. It will become immediately apparent 
which lines are causing the problem because they will be black.
Figure 5.25  The AXIS CHECK scene properties, layers, and  
active style
The SCOPE utility scene displays the model colored by new and existing objects based 
on the CONC - New and CONC - Existing layer’s assigned color (Figure 5.26). The type of 
diagram that is generated is perfect for explaining the scope of a project to a new team 

120

member. This diagram gives an overall snapshot of the amount of demolition and construc-
tion to be completed.
Figure 5.26  The SCOPE scene properties, layers, and active style
The ORIENT FACES utility scene displays the model colored by faces (Figure 5.27). Using 
the diagram, you can easily right-click on the faces and reverse them until all of the fronts 
are facing out. Your entire model should be pink, which means that all fronts are facing out 
and is best for photorealistic rendering.
Figure 5.27  The ORIENT FACES scene properties, layers, and  
active style
The 45 and 90 utility scenes make it easier for you to create plans that follow two or more 
grids (Figure 5.28). These types of scenes save the location and rotation of the axes. Keep in 
mind that in this example you are switching the grid to 45 degrees, but you could use any 
angle of grid shift.

121
Chapter 5: The Professional’s SketchUp Template
Figure 5.28  The 90 utility scene properties, layers, and active style
Now create the 45-degree scene. First, right-click on any axis and select Move. Go to the 
Move Sketching Context dialog box and change the Z rotation to 45. This will rotate the 
axes around the blue axis to a 45-degree angle. See Figure 5.29 and Figure 5.30.

Saving as a Template
Now that you have added utility scenes, styles, and default layers to the base template, save 
it as your own custom template. Before saving, click on the ALL ON Utility Scene, then 
Click on the DESIGN Utility scene to set your template to the ideal default state. Click on 
the File drop-down menu and select Save to update the saved version in your RESOURCES/
Templates folder. Now, click on the Window (SketchUp on Mac) drop-down menu and 
choose Preferences. Click on the Template tab, click the Browse button, and navigate to your 
templates in the RESOURCES/Templates folder. Select the BIC_Default Template.skp and 
click Open.
When you choose a new template, you must always start a new document to see the 
template activate. Click on the File drop-down menu and select New. You will see the new 
active default template with all of the custom layers, styles, and scenes.
Chapter Points
☑
☑The Bright Ideas Consultants default template is available for download at www 
.suexch.com.
☑
☑Not all styles need to have a scene. Some of the hatching and 2D drawing styles will be 
selected when the scene is created. This is up to the user’s discretion based on the type 
of design you do, whether or not you need each of these utility scenes.
☑
☑The utility styles and utility scenes created in this chapter are only a few possibilities. 
Experiment with other properties attached to styles and scenes to determine how to 
make your SketchUp workflow even more efficient.
☑
☑All utility styles, scenes, and layer states should be modified to fit your project type. A 
default template is a constant work in progress.

Chapter 6
The Professional’s 
SketchUp Environment
A 
professional’s work environment is streamlined, logical, and 
organized. SketchUp provides a default environment that is great 
for learning but is ultimately not fit for professional use. Customize the 
SketchUp environment to make it work best for you. Optimize system 
resources, remove visual clutter, and access all commands with a keystroke 
by adding your own set of shortcuts to enhance your SketchUp experience.
Toolbars
Toolbars generally clutter screen space with static icons taking up space that should 
be used for exciting 3D graphics (Figure 6.1, Figure 6.2). Using toolbars and icons takes 
your eyes off of the design. It’s like texting while driving: it’s very distracting and can be 
disastrous. That might be an exaggeration, but seriously, you should keep your eyes on 
the road and model at all times by minimizing your use of toolbars. Instead of having all 
those buttons and icons, a better solution is to have an extensive collection of keyboard 

124
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
shortcuts. If you can’t completely eliminate toolbars and go full-screen full-time, try to limit 
yourself to the following settings.
☑
☑A pixel is a valuable commodity. Maximize your 3D workspace by minimizing your toolbar 
footprint. Select View c Toolbars c Large Buttons to toggle the large icons on and off.
☑
☑Monitors are enormous these days, so it is reasonable to allow yourself one row of toolbars 
across the top of your screen. Select View c Toolbars and open the following toolbars: 
Construction, Drawing, Layers, Measurements, Modification, Principal, Sections, and Walk-
through (Figure 6.3). These toolbars are worth keeping open all the time. When you’re 
performing specific tasks, you’ll need to open other toolbars briefly, but you don’t need to 
have them open at all times. Once you start working with your favorite tools, you’ll be able 
to determine which toolbars you prefer to have open and accessible at all times.
☑
☑Dock the toolbars to organize your workspace. Click and drag an undocked toolbar to 
the top, bottom, or side of the screen. The toolbar will lock itself to the SketchUp win-
dow. To undock a toolbar, click and drag on the line at the left of the toolbar, move it 
away from the perimeter of the SketchUp workspace, and release the toolbar to place it 
where you want.
Figure 6.1  Excessive toolbars are distracting and take attention away from the task at  
hand, which is designing.

TIP  Once you have all of your toolbars in place, select View c Toolbars c Save Toolbar 
positions. Now, you can undock and reposition the toolbars, and always be able to get 
back to the original positions by choosing View c Toolbars c Restore Toolbar Positions.
Dialogs
All dialog boxes and windows are available from the Window drop-down menu. You can collapse 
all dialogs by clicking on the window heading. While they are collapsed, the dialog boxes can be 
docked to other dialogs. Typically, it is best to keep open only the dialogs that you’ll need to use 
regularly—such as Entity Info, Materials, Components, Styles, Layers, Scenes, and Shadows. The 
other dialogs are not used as often, so it is fine to open them on an as-needed basis.

126
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
You can hide all of the dialogs at once by clicking on the Window drop-down menu and 
choosing Hide Dialogs. Unhide the dialogs by going to the same menu and choosing Show 
Dialogs. See Figure 6.4 and Figure 6.5.
Figure 6.4  A cluttered screen is distracting and takes attention away from the task at 
hand, which is designing.
Figure 6.5  All of the same tools and dialogs are docked and organized. A clean work-
space leads to productivity.

127
Chapter 6: The Professional’s SketchUp Environment
System Preferences
SketchUp has additional settings you can use to tweak your system and make it more 
streamlined and efficient. Use the Preferences dialog to adjust these settings. System 
preferences do not travel with the model; they are local SketchUp settings that are the same 
for every model you open. You will need to adjust these settings on every computer you 
work on. To access system preferences, click on the Window (SketchUp on Mac) drop-down 
menu and choose Preferences.
Drawing
The easiest way to draw in SketchUp is to use a three-
button, scroll-wheel mouse utilizing click-move-click. 
SketchUp’s default settings provide both the click-drag-
release and click-move-click style of drawing. Change 
the Drawing settings to allow only Click-Move-Click 
and Continuous Line (Figure 6.6). This will prevent you 
from clicking and dragging, which makes it very easy 
to accidentally move objects by tiny increments or 
accidentally draw tiny, almost-unnoticeable unwanted 
geometry. Drawing style is a personal preference, so feel 
free to adjust to the one that works for you.
Files
By specifying file locations, you can save time 
because you won’t have to navigate through 
multiple folders to perform common SketchUp 
tasks (Figure 6.7). When you import, export, and 
open collections, SketchUp will already know where 
you want to look first. Select Window c Preferences 
and then select the Files menu at the left. Set your 
default file locations as follows:
☑
☑In the Models field, define the starting point for 
all open and save operations. Designate the direc-
tory path as \Desktop\ACTIVE PROJECTS\ or your 
office’s shared network drive.
Figure 6.6  System Preferences – Drawing
Figure 6.7  System Preferences – Files on 
Windows. This feature is not available on Mac.

128
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
☑
☑In the Components field, set the default location to use when you open or create a 
collection in the Components browser. Set the directory path to \Desktop\ACTIVE 
PROJECTS\RESOURCES\Components\.
☑
☑In the Materials field, set the default location to use when you open or create a collec-
tion in the Materials browser. Set the directory path to \Desktop\ACTIVE PROJECTS\
RESOURCES\Materials\.
☑
☑In the Styles field, set the default location to use when you open or create a collection 
in the Styles browser. Set the directory path to \Desktop\ACTIVE PROJECTS\RESOURCES\
Styles\.
☑
☑The Texture Images field is where you can set the default location for all images that 
can be used as textures. SketchUp will use this location as the starting point for all 
File c Insert c Image as Texture operations. Set the directory path to \Desktop\TEMP\.
☑
☑In the Watermark Images field, set the default location for all images that can be used as 
a watermark. Set the directory path to \Desktop\ACTIVE PROJECTS\.
☑
☑In the Export Models field, set the default location for all models that are to be 
exported out of SketchUp. SketchUp will use this location as the starting point for 
all File c Export c 3D Model operations. Set the directory path to \Desktop\ACTIVE 
PROJECTS\.
General
Within the General settings, make sure the Auto-Save box is checked, and allow SketchUp to 
automatically save your model every 5 minutes (Figure 6.8). Auto-saving can take a long time 
if your model is large; however, by applying the model lightening techniques explained in 
this book you will minimize the problem. Remember, 
SketchUp will not auto-save a new model until you 
have first saved it yourself.
Creating a backup file is pretty much a neces-
sity—just in case! A backup file is saved in the same 
folder as the original .skp file and given the exten-
sion .skb. In the rare event that a model becomes 
unusable, change the file extension of the backup 
from .skb to .skp and you will be able to open the 
file in SketchUp.
Figure 6.8  System Preferences – General

129
Chapter 6: The Professional’s SketchUp Environment
Open GL
Open GL settings can be used to troubleshoot your graphics card if strange things happen in 
your model (Figure 6.9). Uncheck the Use Hardware Acceleration box to disable your graphics 
card and take it out of the equation. If this fixes the problem, you know that your graphics 
card needs to be replaced or is incompatible, or the driver needs to be updated.
Use Maximum Texture Size is not nec-
essary and will actually slow down your 
computer performance; leave this option 
unchecked. The maximum texture size 
improves the appearance of what you see 
on your screen but does so at the cost of 
system performance. This setting will not 
improve printing or exporting resolution.
The Use Fast Feedback option is neces-
sary; leave it turned on. SketchUp typically 
controls this setting on its own. If your 
graphics card supports this feature, SketchUp 
will use it.
In the Capabilities section, choose the best options for your graphics card. Anti-aliasing 
smooths out the jagged edges that result from a diagonal line of pixels. Pick a setting with the 
highest amount of anti-alias your monitor can handle, so your model will look its best on your 
screen.
Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts allow you to access any SketchUp command with the press of a key. Use 
shortcuts to help you work faster and relieve a huge amount of strain on your eyes and mouse 
hand. Every time you take your eyes off your design, you are slowing down. Take the time to 
focus on your keyboarding technique and set up your own custom keyboard shortcuts.
Adding Shortcuts
Modify your keyboard shortcuts in the Preferences dialog box by clicking on the Window 
(SketchUp on Mac) drop-down menu and choosing Preferences c Shortcuts (Figure 6.10).
1.	 Type a command, such as hide, into the Filter window to parse through all of the 
options and quickly find a command.
Figure 6.9  System Preferences - Open GL

130
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Click on a command in the Function 
box—for example, Edit/Hide.
3.	 Click in the Add Shortcut box and press 
the H key.
4.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to lock in the 
assigned keyboard shortcut.
TIP  If you try to assign a key that is already associated with another command, you 
will be prompted to reassign the key to the new command. Don't worry. You can 
always use the Reset All button to restore the keyboard shortcuts to the default state.
TIP  By using shortcuts to interact with the Windows operating system, you will be 
able to work faster and more efficiently in any program. Hold down the Alt key and tap 
the Tab key to scroll through all the open applications. Once you are in an application, 
hold down the Ctrl key and tap the Tab key to scroll through the open files within that 
application. Hold down the Windows key and tap the Tab key to see a 3D scrolling 
effect that displays all open applications.
Now that you’ve assigned the keyboard shortcut H to the command Hide Geometry, the H 
key is taken; however, several helpful hide commands are left unassigned. You may have trouble 
remembering them if they don’t have an “H” associated with them. Fortunately, you can use 
combinations of modifier keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt to add more shortcut options in the 
Add Shortcut text box. To assign a modifier key to a shortcut command, simply press and hold 
the modifier key while you enter the desired key in the text box. For example, to hide the rest 
of the model when you’re editing a group or component, assign the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+H. 
To unhide all, assign the keyboard shortcut Shift+H. Assign the shortcut Alt+H to show/hide 
hidden geometry. For a less-frequently used command such as Hide Similar Components, try 
to assign a combination of the modifier keys such as Ctrl+Shift+H.
In addition to the common commands and tools, it is helpful to have shortcuts assigned 
to just about every command you use. Figure 6.11 lists some less-frequently used commands 
that will help you expedite modeling every day.

You can use the Shortcuts tab to export 
and share a list of your shortcuts and file 
locations. Click on the Export button to 
save a .dat file containing all of your short-
cuts. You can email this file to colleagues 
and even use this file to set up standard 
shortcuts and file locations on your other 
machines. Simply click the Import button 
and select the preferences.dat file.
Download the official BIC_Shortcuts list at www.suexch.com/TSWFA. Save the 
file to your TEMP folder. Next, in the Shortcuts window, click on Import. Select the 
BIC_Shortcuts file from your TEMP folder and click Import. You may be prompted 
to reassign some of your current shortcuts, so be sure to archive your current 
settings first!

the spacebar. This is an excellent default three-point stance for tackling SketchUp. If you 
already have a comfortable stance, stick with it—but at the same time, don’t be afraid to try 
something new. Just be sure to always use the keyboard shortcuts and practice using keys 
without looking, even if it seems slower at first. Keyboard shortcuts will make you faster.
Chapter Points
☑
☑A clean screen will encourage efficiency and ultimately increase productivity.
☑
☑Keep your eyes on the model by using keystrokes without looking at the keyboard. Even 
if this technique takes longer at first, it will make you much faster in the long run.
☑
☑Customize your keyboard shortcuts in a way that makes sense to you.
☑
☑Try using keyboard shortcuts in other programs too.
Figure 6.11  Take the time to add additional shortcuts. 
If you constantly access a command using an icon or a 
drop-down menu, take the time to assign a keyboard 
shortcut to that command.

SketchUp Collections
W
hen using SketchUp, people frequently miss the opportunity to 
fully organize and even use collections. That is a big mistake. 
Collections are notoriously messy. Whether you’re working with a 
collection of components, styles, or textures, it is easy to be lazy and not 
keep the collections clean and organized—but now there is no excuse 
for laziness. This section will show you all of the rules and resources you 
need to build extensive, high-resolution, organized collections. Adhering 
to these standards will ensure that you always have the files you need 
right when you need them.
Material Collection
You may have noticed that almost every amateur SketchUp model has the same shingles, 
bricks, and grass. Avoid using the materials that are preloaded in SketchUp. These materials 
are easily recognizable and will make your models look elementary. Diligently search for 

133
texture images to find ones that best represent the materials you have chosen for your 
design. This section contains several strategies for finding, creating, and organizing your 
professional material collection.
The Materials Browser
Before you begin in earnest, take a moment to explore the Materials browser. Launch it 
by activating the Paint Bucket tool, or by clicking on the Window drop-down menu and 
choosing Materials. The Materials browser has two separate tabs: Select and Edit (Figure 7.1). 
The Select tab displays preloaded collections, favorite collections, and the materials in your 
model. This is where you find materials to apply to surfaces within your model. The Edit tab 
is where you can change the many properties of a material already added to your model 
(Figure 7.2). Use the Edit tab to change the color, scale, texture image, and opacity of the 
active material.
Figure 7.1  The Materials Browser’s Select tab allows you to choose mate-
rials from preloaded collections and see the materials already in your 
model.

134
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 7.2  The Materials Browser’s Edit tab allows you to modify the 
properties of a material.
TIP  The Material Browser is very different on the Mac, but the underlying concepts 
are the same. This book does not contain Mac screenshots, but it is not hard to apply 
the directions from Windows to Mac.
Creating a Material
Texture images are relatively small, optimized images that can repeat infinitely without 
seams, and they are essential for creating professional-quality SketchUp materials. 
Professional-quality materials are essential for creating convincing 3D models that accurately 
represent your design.
An enormous number of texture images are available online for free. To begin collecting 
textures, perform a Google image search for “tileable grass.” You can sort the results from a 
Google image search by many filters, most importantly size. For this exercise, click Medium 
to view images that are at a high enough resolution to look great, yet still maintain a reason-
able file size. When searching for images, you can find the most valuable images by adding 
the words “tileable,” “texture,” or “material” to the query (Figure 7.3).

135
Chapter 7: SketchUp Collections
Figure 7.3  A Google image search
Click on an image thumbnail to navigate to the site 
that hosts the image. From there, you can right-click on 
the image and choose Save Image As. Save the image to 
your TEMP folder. Raw texture images should be saved 
in the TEMP folder because you won’t need the original 
image once it is imported into a SketchUp material.
Now, add the texture image to a new material in 
SketchUp. To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 In the Materials browser, click the Create Mate-
rial button to add a new material (see Figure 7.4). 
When you create a new material, the Create 
­Material dialog opens and creates a copy of the 
active material.
2.	 Name the material Grass 01.
3.	 Click on the folder icon to add a texture image. 
Navigate to your TEMP folder and select the Grass 
Texture material. Click the Open button.
4.	 Click OK to finish creating the material.
Figure 7.4  Use the Create Mate-
rial dialog to modify the properties 
of a new material.

136
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Once a texture is created, it resides in the current model only. You will need to add the new 
material to a collection to access it while working on other models. To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the In Model Collection (house icon) to see the materials that are in your model.
2.	 Right-click the Grass 01 material thumbnail and choose Save As.
3.	 Navigate to the RESOURCES/MATERIALS folder and save the material in the appro-
priate material folder. If you set your default folders as described in Chapter 6, “The 
Professional’s SketchUp Environment,” you will be taken there immediately.
Other excellent free and commercial sources for textures are available. Try searching 
Google for “free textures” and see what you can find. When you use an image search and 
find an image you like, the site hosting it will usually have other collections and textures 
available. Click on the Website for this image link to view more offerings from the site host-
ing the image. Access more materials in SketchUp by clicking on the Details menu and 
choosing Get More to see a SketchUp blog post about sources for free texture images. 
Lastly, FormFonts.com has an extensive library of texture images available at a very reasonable 
price. Regardless of where you get your textures, just be sure that you keep them organized.
Adding the Collection to Favorites
Now that you have added a material to your collection, you need to add that collection to 
your favorites within the Materials browser. This will give you access to the collection every 
time you open SketchUp.
1.	 In the Materials browser, click the 
Details menu and choose Add Collec-
tion to Favorites (Figure 7.5).
2.	 Navigate to the RESOURCES/MATERI-
ALS folder and select OK.
3.	 Click the Material Collections drop-
down menu and select the MATE-
RIALS folder. The new Materials 
collection will be at the bottom of the 
list. Once a collection is added to your 
favorites, you can always access the 
collection from the Collections drop-
down menu in the Materials browser.
Figure 7.5  To manage material collections 
and favorites, use the Details menu in the 
Materials browser.

137
Chapter 7: SketchUp Collections
TIP  Manage your collection from the secondary pane or from a file browser such as 
Windows Explorer. Under the BIC_Materials folder, add logical subfolders such as 
Hard Surfaces, Textiles, Metals, Roofing, Stone, Tile, Glass, Water, Wood, Cladding, 
and Ground Cover.
Component Collections
Components have several useful applications, one being prebuilt SketchUp models of 
common objects that will save you an immense amount of time. Everyone can use objects 
such as lamps, plants, cars, and furniture, but no one wants to build these complex objects 
from scratch every time they are needed. Fortunately, component collections allow you to 
save and organize all of these objects for easy access and reuse.
The Components Browser
The Components browser is where you can view component collections, access the 3D 
Warehouse, and see which components are in your model. To access the Components 
browser, click on the Window drop-down menu and choose Components (Figure 7.6).
Figure 7.6  Use the Components browser to find components and organize them into 
collections.

138
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Finding Components
Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of components are immediately available for free 
within the Trimble 3D Warehouse. This is a huge repository of user-created, user-submitted, 
and user-rated models. Buyer beware, though. You get what you pay for, and when you pay 
nothing you should not expect much. Many of the models on the 3D Warehouse need to 
be optimized, correctly scaled, or even completed. This is not to say that it is not a good 
place to look. Just keep in mind that most of the models in the 3D Warehouse are not plug-
and-play; they will require some work to make them useable.
To search the 3D Warehouse, enter your query directly into the search box in the Com-
ponents browser. You can search for object titles, such as chair, table, car, and people. You 
can also search for brand names, such as West Elm, Pella, and Mercedes; brand searches typi-
cally return more favorable results. Once your search is complete, use the arrows at the bot-
tom left and right to navigate through the search results (Figure 7.7).
At this point, you can click on a model thumb-
nail in the Components browser and then click 
again in your model to place the component. 
The selected component will be copied into your 
model.
Searching within the Components browser 
is a quick way to grab models from a minimalist 
interface. You can also access the 3D Warehouse 
through the Web, which provides significantly 
more model information and search options. 
Click the Details menu and select View in Trimble 
3D Warehouse. This will launch the web version 
of the Trimble 3D Warehouse, which will be larger 
and easier to view; but most important, it will be 
sortable by ratings and popularity to help you 
filter the best models to the top. You can access 
search results in the 3D Warehouse web interface 
from the Details menu or by clicking on the com-
ponent name in the search results (Figure 7.8).
Figure 7.7  The results of a West Elm 
search

Chapter 7: SketchUp Collections
Figure 7.8  To get more options and information than the Components browser provides, view 
the 3D Warehouse search results in a web browser.
Click the Download Model button to save a component to your ACTIVE PROJECTS/
RESOURCES/COMPONENTS collection.
A better solution for building a component collection is to pay for the models. Form-
Fonts.com offers an extensive collection of excellent professionally built, commercially 
available models. All of the models at FormFonts.com are properly scaled, textured, and opti-
mized, making them easy to use “right out of the box.” For professionals, paying for models is 
worth the small monetary investment to have perfect models in seconds.
Adding a Collection to Favorites
Once you have created a collection, you will want to access it every time you open 
SketchUp. To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Details menu and choose Open or Create a Local Collection.
2.	 Navigate to your RESOURCES folder, select the COMPONENTS folder, and then 
click OK.
3.	 Click the context arrow again and choose Add to Favorites. The COMPONENTS col-
lection will be available every time you open SketchUp under the Component Collec-
tions drop-down menu.

140
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 7.9  In the Components browser, use the Details menu 
to manage component collections and favorites.
TIP  Manage your collection from a file browser such as Windows Explorer. Add 
logical subfolders to the Components folder—for example, Landscape, Furniture, 
Entourage, Doors, Windows, etc. You might even consider organizing your 
components by project.
Styles Collection
Currently, styles are not as widely available as materials and components are; this is probably 
because the preloaded libraries are more than enough to get you started.
Creating a Style
Use the Mix tab in the Styles browser to combine your favorite styles into new creations. To 
do that, follow these steps:
1.	 In the Styles browser, click on the Mix tab. This automatically launches the secondary 
pane.

141
Chapter 7: SketchUp Collections
2.	 In the secondary pane, choose your favorite collection.
3.	 Drag a style to one of the properties in  
the Mix tab. The current style will inherit  
the specified properties from the style that  
you dragged up.
4.	 Click the Style icon to update and save the  
changes made to the current style. The  
watermark will disappear upon updating.
Adding a Style to  
a Collection
Not every style needs to be a part of the default 
template, so you will need a style collection to 
hold additional useful styles. Any style that you 
create should be saved in your Styles collection. 
To save a style, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the In Model Collection (house 
icon) to see which styles are in your 
model; you will see the styles that you 
created in Chapter 5, “The Professional’s 
SketchUp Template.”
2.	 Right-click on a style and choose Save As.
3.	 Navigate to your RESOURCES/STYLES folder, select it, and click Save. If you set your 
default folders as described in Chapter 6, you will be taken there immediately.
Adding a Collection to Favorites
So that this collection is always available when you need it, click on the Details menu and 
select Add Collection to Favorites. Navigate to and select the RESOURCES/STYLES folder 
and choose OK. The collection will be available every time you open SketchUp under the 
Style Collections drop-down menu (Figure 7.11).
TIP  In addition to any new styles you create, add all of the styles from the default 
template to your Styles collection.
Figure 7.10  The Mix tab in the Style 
browser gives you creative license to 
take your favorite styles and blend them.

age style collections and favorites.
Chapter Points
☑
☑Collections are most valuable when they are kept current and organized. Organize 
material and component collections in a way that works for you. Consider organizing 
your collections by types, project, client, or even design style—for example, modern or 
traditional.
☑
☑All browsers have a secondary pane and a drag-and-drop interface that makes managing 
collections easier. You can also manage collections from a file browser.
☑
☑When you use a collection to add materials, components, and styles to your current 
model, you are creating a copy of the original from the collection and placing that copy 
in the model. When you edit the materials, components, or styles, you are editing only 
the copy in the model, not the original in the collection.

Ruby Scripts
R
uby scripts are the original apps. Before apps were extreme fajitas 
and potato poppers, and even before apps allowed you to digitally 
chug a beer on your phone, there were ruby scripts. These little pieces of 
code expedite the tedious and repetitive tasks in SketchUp that drive you 
crazy. If you find that a certain task is taking entirely too long, take a step 
back and start looking for a ruby script. In this section, you will review 
several useful ruby scripts and learn how to find and install some others.
Find Ruby Scripts
Some rubies are free and some aren’t. Just as with the 3D Warehouse, you get what you pay for. 
When you purchase a ruby, typically you can expect to receive support and clear instructions. 
If you grab a free ruby, you should probably expect to put in a little extra effort figuring it out. 
A great place to buy rubies and grab a few freebies is at www.smustard.com. Huge collections 
of free ruby scripts are available at the Ruby Library Depot (Google it), www.sketchucation.com, 
and www.sketchup.com.
Installing Ruby Scripts
Once you have downloaded your ruby, save it to the Plugins folder (for example, C:\
Program Files\Google\Google SketchUp 8\Plugins). Keep in mind that the path could vary, 
depending on your drive name and operating system. If a ruby is zipped, you must extract the 

144
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
contents to this location. After the .rb file is saved in the Plugins folder, you will need to close 
SketchUp and re-open it in order to load the new ruby.
TIP  Sometimes one ruby depends on another to operate properly. Read through any 
instructions and documentation thoroughly before you try to use a ruby. For example, 
many rubies will not work without the sketchup.rb and progressbar.rb rubies installed 
in the Plugins folder.
Newer ruby scripts that are written specifically for SketchUp 8 are packaged as .rbz files. 
The compressed one-file format makes it much easier to install the ruby scripts. To unzip a 
compressed ruby, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Window drop-down and choose Preferences c Extensions.
2.	 Click the Install Extensions button.
3.	 Navigate to and select the .rbz file and click the Open button.
Using Ruby Scripts
You’ll frequently encounter ruby scripts that don’t have any directions or documentation 
explaining exactly how to use the ruby. Once a ruby is installed, you may have to access it 
from different locations, depending on how the author designed the user experience. The 
first place to look is in the drop-down menus (such as Draw, Tools, and Plugins) at the top of 
the screen. If you still can’t find it, open the ruby script in a text editor to gather some clues. 
Authors frequently include a few notes about how to get started (Figure 8.1).
Recommended Ruby Scripts
Listed here are a few ruby scripts that will come in handy when you’re using this book and also 
when you’re modeling in general.  Don’t stop here, there are infinite more rubies out there!
Bézier Spline Tool
Once you’ve mastered the Bézier Spline tool, you will have almost no need to use the Arc tool 
to draw continuous arcs. Furthermore, with this tool, you will have no need for the Freehand 
tool, which is completely inaccurate. You can download the Bézier Spline tool and other tools at 
http://www.sketchup.com/intl/en/download/rubyscripts.html

145
Chapter 8: Ruby Scripts
Figure 8.1  The author’s notes and instructions displayed in a text editor. 
Dashed Lines Ruby
The Dashed Lines ruby will segment a selected line into several different line types. It is 
great for creating dashed lines to represent 2D graphics and for creating rare annotations in 
SketchUp (for example, center lines and column lines). You can find the Dashed Lines ruby at
http://www.smustard.com/script/DashedLines
Scale and Rotate Multiple
Select a few shrubs or trees and run the Scale and Rotate Multiple ruby to randomly scale 
and rotate the objects. This ruby is great for quickly making landscape elements look more 
natural rather than computer generated. You can download it at .

146
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Add Hidden Layer Ruby
When you’re adding a layer in SketchUp, the default is to turn on the layer in all existing 
scenes. The Add Hidden Layer ruby does the opposite and turns it off, which is typically 
more desirable. You can download this ruby at
http://rhin.crai.archi.fr/rld/plugin_details.php?id=6
Zorro Tool
The Zorro tool is helpful when transitioning a sketch model to a refined design, or when 
breaking a model into levels. With the Zorro tool, you draw a line across geometry that slices 
through all the geometry, even the groups and components. Typically, a head-on parallel 
projection view is the best view to use for full control of this ruby. You can download the 
Zorro tool at 
http://rhin.crai.archi.fr/rld/plugin_details.php?id=498
Instant Road Plugin
The Instant Road plugin expedites the creation of realistic roads in SketchUp. This plugin 
picks up where the Sandbox tool falls short. You can download it at
http://valiarchitects.com/sketchup_scripts/instant-road
Flatten Tool
The Flatten tool takes any 3D object and reduces it to a 2D symbol. This ruby script will 
come in handy when a 3D object does not quite render the way you wanted it to render in 
a plan. You can download it at
http://www.smustard.com/script/Flatten
Chapter Points
☑
☑If you are performing a task that is repetitive, tedious, and taking entirely too long, stop 
immediately and look for a ruby script.
☑
☑Paying for rubies is absolutely worth it. They are usually inexpensive and will save you 
hours of labor working on mind-numbing, repetitious tasks and searching for freebies.

LayOut
Like Kevin from Home Alone, LayOut is easily overlooked and very much 
underestimated. More often than not, LayOut is an afterthought—if it is 
even considered at all—yet this program is the keystone of an effective 
SketchUp workflow. LayOut turns 3D SketchUp models into stylized 
print and screen presentations—presentations that ultimately sell your 
ideas and produce the instructions to build the spaces you envision in 
SketchUp. In Part III you will receive a complete education in all that is 
LayOut, from theory to the toolset.

Chapter 9
Introduction to LayOut
S
ketchUp Pro is a software suite that includes the unrestricted 
version of SketchUp, as well as the invaluable presentation 
application LayOut—and StyleBuilder, which is not covered in this book. 
Although SketchUp Pro is undeniably excellent by itself, SketchUp Pro 
becomes truly radical when it is paired with LayOut (Figure 9.1).
Figure 9.1  The free version of SketchUp is for hob-
byists; SketchUp Pro is for professionals.
What Is LayOut?
In short, LayOut is a multifaceted Presentation tool. It is a page-creation program that has 
3D presentation capabilities coupled with 2D Drafting tools (Figure 9.2). In LayOut, you 
arrange 3D perspective views and scaled 2D orthographic views on a sheet of paper to 
graphically explain a design. When you’re done, you can use LayOut’s sleek drawing toolset 
to add informative annotations on top of those views and provide an additional layer of 
information for your audience (Figure 9.3). With LayOut’s tools, you can quickly and easily 
add dimensions, text, leader text, callouts, and custom line types.

150
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 9.2  The levels of information in a LayOut presentation include title block, 3D viewport, 
and annotation.

Chapter 9: Introduction to LayOut
Figure 9.3  When all of the graphics and annotations are flattened, you 
have an architectural drawing.

152
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Design in SketchUp. Present in LayOut. That is the basic concept. For a more in-depth 
explanation, read on to learn about paper space, model space, and the dynamic link between 
the two that makes LayOut such a valuable tool.
Paper Space and Model Space
Now for the longer, technical answer: LayOut is SketchUp’s equivalent to CAD’s paper space. 
Take a moment to fully grasp the concept of designing in model space and presenting in 
paper space.
Model Space
SketchUp’s model space is where your design comes to life. Everything built in SketchUp 3D 
is drawn at a 1:1 real-world scale. This means that if a wall is to be built 10 feet tall in the real 
world, you draw the wall 10 feet tall in your SketchUp model. You don’t need to crunch the 
numbers into an architectural scale while working in model space. Everything in SketchUp is 
built to the size it is intended to be built to in the real world (Figure 9.4).
Figure 9.4  Model space is where you design and build a model representing your design. 
Model space contains mostly 3D objects rather than graphics and annotations.

153
Chapter 9: Introduction to LayOut
Paper Space
LayOut’s paper space is where your presentation comes to life (Figure 9.5). Place the 
viewports (windows looking into your SketchUp model) on a standard paper size. Arrange 
the viewports on the sheet and set the orthographic views to architectural scales. In other 
words, LayOut will very quickly do the math so you can present your life-sized designs at 
a reduced architectural scale. This is where you will determine what sheet size you need to 
present your design at a specific architectural scale.
Figure 9.5  Paper space is where you create and organize the pages of your pre-
sentation based on a specific paper size. Paper space contains only 2D annotations 
and text overlayed on static 2D views of the 3D SketchUp model.

154
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Dynamic Link
The 3D SketchUp model space and the 2D LayOut paper space are connected. The 
dynamic link between them is critical to the efficiency of the SketchUp workflow for 
architecture. After you modify and save the SketchUp model, LayOut will let you know 
that the link needs to be updated. When you update or refresh the model within LayOut, 
all of the linked 2D drawings in your presentation will reflect the most current design 
(Figure 9.6). This dynamic link eliminates the need to re-export every time you make a 
presentation. This feature also gives you the freedom to make last-minute design changes 
in 3D and then simply update your presentation before a meeting. This dynamic link gives 
you the power to progressively build your presentation in small, one-at-a-time pieces 
leading up to the final presentation and construction documents. This type of process is 
much more manageable than tackling a large presentation or an entire set of construction 
documents all at once.
Figure 9.6  When a SketchUp model is dynamically linked to a LayOut presentation, all draw-
ings are derived from one model and updated simultaneously.

155
Chapter 9: Introduction to LayOut
Why LayOut?
After you’ve worked in SketchUp, you may find it difficult to go back into the cyan and 
magenta world of 2D CAD or the tedious world of BIM. SketchUp and LayOut are much 
faster, more fun, and more colorful to work with than other drafting programs. If you can 
accomplish the same goals and so much more with SketchUp and LayOut, why not use 
LayOut?In addition to being fun and colorful, there are a few purely utilitarian reasons for 
using LayOut. It has a few professional design features that should convince you—or your 
boss—to pull the trigger on SketchUp Pro.
Expanded Export Options
SketchUp Pro and LayOut offers several export options for presenting, sharing with 
consultants, and moving the project into other software packages. You can export a .pdf 
from LayOut to produce large format prints and deliverables to pass out at a meeting. You 
can also export the LayOut presentation paper space or SketchUp model space as a CAD file 
in .dwg or .dxf format. To finish the job, you can then open the LayOut file in your familiar 
2D drafting program. Finally, you can export all pages as .jpg files or .png files from LayOut. 
This option replaces the need for exporter plugins within SketchUp, and it expedites the 
entire export process.
Professional Renderings
If you are a professional designer building a SketchUp model, you probably want others to 
see it. Because it is limited to your screen resolution, the free version of SketchUp does not 
have the export capabilities required by professionals. SketchUp Pro, mainly LayOut, gives 
you all of the tools and rendering settings you’ll need to maximize your SketchUp model for 
presentation and sharing.
Exporting from SketchUp Pro allows you to create extremely high-resolution raster 
images and also gives you several vector file formats (Figure 9.7). Exporting from LayOut 
combines the best of raster and vector into one hybrid view. This concept will be covered 
in detail later in Chapter 10, “The LayOut Interface.”

156
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 9.7  SketchUp Pro can create much better images that you can use for large-
scale presentations.
Software Replacement
When you render and export images from your 3D model, you have to insert those 
images into page-creation software to create the deliverables. Then if you want to make 
a slideshow, you need to insert those same images into slideshow software to create the 
presentation. Then you have to use another application to create a completely separate 
set of construction documents. If you need to make any changes, you need to re-export, 
reinsert, re-export, reinsert…. LayOut gives you the ability to link one 3D model to a 
program that can create all these drawings and presentation materials at the same time, and 
simultaneously update all the drawings and renderings.
LayOut can replace the page-creation software normally used to develop print presenta-
tions. For example, with LayOut, you don’t need to export from SketchUp and use programs 
such as InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator to arrange those images on a sheet. LayOut can 
do all of this and do it better because of the dynamic link to SketchUp and the expanded 
rendering settings optimized for SketchUp models.
SketchUp Pro and LayOut together can replace all of your CAD drafting software. The 
techniques provided in this book pull the best strategies and features from BIM and 2D 
drafting into one efficient workflow centered around SketchUp Pro. SketchUp Pro and Lay-
Out can replace Architectural Desktop, Revit, and VectorWorks, as well as any other 2D or 
3D BIM vector drafting programs.

157
Chapter 9: Introduction to LayOut
LayOut replaces slideshow software such as PowerPoint. When it’s time for you to pre­
sent at a meeting, you can use LayOut’s Presentation mode to display your 2D LayOut pre-
sentation on a projection screen. LayOut’s Presentation mode enables you to present each 
page as a slide, and it has a red Line tool you can use to mark up a set of drawings while 
you’re giving your presentation in front of an audience (Figure 9.8). The red lines are conve-
niently added to a time-stamped layer for easy review, revision, and deletion later. LayOut 
doesn’t offer any transitions or sound effects, but animated page curls and swoosh noises 
really don’t do much to sell a design.
Figure 9.8  Red lines in LayOut's Presentation mode allow you to mark up a set in front of an 
audience.
Line Control
SketchUp’s Profiles, Depth Cue, and Section Cuts settings give you some ability to control 
line weights. They offer everything you need to make compelling 3D views and animations. 
LayOut gives you full control over line weights even when you’re working with scaled 2D 
drawings that require several line weights to align with industry graphic standards.

158
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Each viewport within LayOut can be set to a specific line weight independent of other 
viewports. This flexibility allows you to thicken large detail drawings and thin out smaller 
scaled plans.
The annotation lines and shapes you add in LayOut can be set to any line weight. You 
can assign several different line types and arrowheads to any line you draw in LayOut (Fig-
ure 9.9), and you can adjust the color of those lines. The combination of these settings gives 
you the ability to create any symbol or annotation in the graphic style you choose.
Figure 9.9  Line weights, line types, and arrows are abundant in LayOut.

The LayOut Interface
T
his chapter explains the intricacies of the LayOut interface and 
introduces all of the settings, toolbars, and features you’ll need to 
use LayOut. Use it now as a roadmap, while you tour LayOut and become 
familiar with the interface. Even after you’ve mastered the concepts 
explained here, you’ll be able to use it as a helpful resource to answer 
any questions you have about individual menus, settings, and dialogs.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Getting Started
To open LayOut, click the icon on your desktop. The Getting Started window will appear, 
allowing you to access new templates, recent files, and recovered presentations.
New Tab
Initially, you will be taken to the New tab by default (Figure 10.1). Preloaded templates that 
you can use to create new presentations will appear in the right pane. From the Default 
Templates library, select either a title block or a plain piece of paper. To select a default 
template (a template you will always start with), check the Always Use Selected Template 
box. Typically, you won’t need to use this feature because you will need different sizes of 
paper and title blocks for each presentation you create.
Figure 10.1  The New tab in the Getting Started window

161
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Recent Tab
The Recent tab displays all of the documents you have worked on in the not-so-distant 
past. When you use this tab, be careful because it is similar to My Recent Documents. Even 
though a file is shown there today, it might not be shown there tomorrow if you open other 
LayOut presentations. If you are using the Recent tab, you may not be aware of where you 
are saving the actual file.
The best way to open a file that you have already created is to click the Open an Existing 
File button at the bottom-left corner of the Getting Started window. Make sure you know 
where you are saving files so you can navigate to the appropriate project folder when you 
need them. To open a file, you can either double-click on its thumbnail or select the thumb-
nail and choose Open.
Recovered Tab
The Recovered tab at the top of the Getting Started window appears when files need to be 
recovered; you can use the recovery feature to help you get back work that was lost during a 
crash. LayOut does crash at times if you overload it, but it also does a great job of recovering 
files. Don’t worry, though; the techniques you’ll learn in this book will drastically reduce the 
number of crashes you experience. If LayOut does crash, re-open LayOut and look for your 
recovered document in the Recovered tab.
Main Toolbar
The Main toolbar in LayOut contains the most commonly used and basic tools (Figure 10.2). 
Undock a LayOut toolbar by clicking and dragging on the line at the far left of the toolbar. 
Dock a toolbar by dragging the header to the top, bottom, or side of the screen.
Figure 10.2  The Main toolbar
TIP  See Chapter 11, “The Professional’s LayOut Environment,” for more information 
on creating and customizing the LayOut toolbars.

162
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Document Setup
The Document Setup settings apply to the currently open document; they are not 
global settings for LayOut. In other words, these settings can travel with a template or a 
presentation file, but they will not change globally for every document you open in LayOut. 
To open the Document Setup dialog, click on the Window drop-down menu and choose 
“Document Setup.”
General Tab
The General tab has fields where you can give credit to the author of the file and describe 
the contents of the file (Figure 10.3). These fields are rarely used. However, if you are sharing 
a template with others and would like to receive authorship credit, you might want to fill 
out this section.
Figure 10.3  The General tab

163
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Grid Tab
The Grid tab is where you can adjust the size and visual properties of the grid (Figure 10.4).
TIP  The numerals in the diagrams refer to the keyed notes and do not represent any 
order of operation.
Figure 10.4  The Grid tab
1.	 You can check and uncheck the Show Grid check box to toggle between making the 
grid visible and invisible.
2.	 You can use the radio buttons to set the grid type to lines or points. Typically, a tradi-
tional line grid is the most useful option (Figure 10.5).
3.	 Click the Major Grid check box to toggle the visibility of the thicker grid lines on 
and off.
4.	 To adjust the major grid spacing, click in the Spacing text field, enter the grid spacing 
you want, and then press Enter. You can use decimal format or you can use a space to 
separate inches (the default units) from fractions.

164
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 10.5  The Grid options in LayOut
5.	 To change the color of the major grid, click on the color block. This automatically 
opens the Color Inspector, where you can select a color from several different tabs: 
Wheel, RGB, HSB, Grays, Image, and List. Typically, the first three tabs offer the easiest 
way to make the color selection you want.
6.	 Click the Minor Grid check box to toggle the visibility of the thinner grid lines on 
and off.
7.	 The minor grid is composed of thinner lines and fills in the major grid by the speci-
fied number of subdivisions. Change the number of subdivisions by typing a new 
number into the Subdivisions text field, and then press Enter. You can also use the 
Up and Down arrows to the right of the Subdivisions field to adjust the number of 
subdivisions.
8.	 To change the color of the minor grid, click on the color block. This automatically 
opens the Color palette where you can select a color from several different tabs: 
Wheel, RGB, HSB, Grays, Image, and List. Typically, the first three tabs offer the easiest 
way to make the color selection you desire.
9.	 When the Print Grid box is checked, the grid will automatically be printed to paper 
from the printer. This feature is helpful when you are working with schematic 
drawings.
10.	 The Clip Grid to Page Margins setting limits the grid to the extents of the margins. 
The presentation margins are controlled in the Paper tab.
11.	 When the Draw Grid on Top box is checked, the grid will appear on top of any view-
ports and geometry created in LayOut.

165
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
TIP  You can adjust how tools interact with the grid by right-clicking in the presentation 
background. From this right-click menu, you can turn the grid and object snap on or off, 
as well as toggle whether the grid is visible or not.
Paper Tab
The paper properties are where you indicate the overall size of the sheet of paper you will 
use for your presentation and where you determine the quality of the renderings within your 
presentation (Figure 10.6).
Figure 10.6  The Paper tab
1.	 Click the Paper drop-down menu to choose from preloaded standard paper sizes.
2.	 The Portrait and Landscape radio buttons allow you to select the orientation of the 
sheet, portrait or landscape.
3.	 You can create a custom paper size by entering the dimensions of the sheet into the 
Width and Height text fields. Press Enter to lock in the dimension entries.

166
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
4.	 Change the color of the paper, or presentation background, by clicking on the color 
block. This automatically opens the Colors Inspector (discussed later in this chapter), 
where you can select a color from several different tabs: Wheel, RGB, HSB, Grays, 
Image, and List. Typically, the first three tabs provide the easiest way to make the 
color selection you want.
5.	 Check the Print Paper Color box only if you are using someone else’s printer. This 
will actually waste expensive ink by reproducing the background color on the paper, 
which is rarely necessary.
6.	 Turn on the margins by clicking the Margins check box.
7.	 Set your margin depths by entering the dimensions in the Left, Right, Top, and Bot-
tom fields.
8.	 Change the color of the margin lines by clicking on the color block. This automatically 
opens the Color Inspector where you can select a color from several different tabs: 
Wheel, RGB, HSB, Grays, Image, and List. Typically, the first three tabs provide the easi-
est way to make your color selections.
9.	 Click the Print Margin Lines check box so that the margin lines will appear on the 
final prints and exports.
10.	 The Edit Quality setting determines the rendering quality while you’re working in 
a LayOut presentation. In other words, it indicates the quality (or how clear) the 
SketchUp models and images will appear on the screen while you’re working in 
LayOut.
11.	 The Output Quality setting determines the final rendering quality when the project 
is exported or printed. In other words, it determines how clear the SketchUp models 
and images will appear on the paper that comes out of the printer.
TIP  Always use low quality settings when you’re editing a document. If you don’t, you 
will waste a lot of time rendering at a high resolution you don’t need.
References Tab
A reference is an external file that is inserted into your LayOut presentation and connected 
with a link (or path). The References tab allows you to control what files are linked, and it 
shows whether or not those files are current (Figure 10.7). LayOut can reference text, image, 
and SketchUp files.

167
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Figure 10.7  The References tab
1.	 When the Check References When Loading this Document box is checked, LayOut 
will alert you to any out-of-date references when a file opens. If a reference has been 
modified, it will appear in red in the References tab and its status will read “Out of 
Date.” This is a good setting to use when you’re first learning LayOut; however, as you 
become more familiar with the program, you will probably update the links manually.
2.	 The File Name column displays the name and extension of the linked file.
3.	 The Status column indicates whether the file’s reference is current or not—in other 
words, it tells you if the file needs to be updated. A reference’s status is Current, Out 
of Date, or Embedded. Current files are up-to-date and no action is necessary. Out-of-
date files need to have the references updated. An Embedded status means the file is 
no longer linked to the original source; instead, it is part of the LayOut presentation.
4.	 The Insertion Date column tells you when the file was added to the LayOut presentation.
5.	 To update a link, highlight the out-of-date red filename and click the Update button 
at the bottom of the Document Setup window. A selected viewport will highlight the 
reference within the References tab, and vice versa.

168
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
6.	 Relink a missing file by highlighting the filename and then clicking Relink. Navigate to 
the file you want to relink to, or swap, and choose Open. You’ll need to do this if you 
move the original file or want to swap to a different version of the original file.
7.	 If you click the Unlink button at the bottom of the Document Setup window, the file 
will be embedded (become part of the LayOut presentation).
8.	 Click the Edit button to automatically open the reference in the associated program. 
You can assign preferred programs for word documents and images in the Prefer-
ences menu (covered later in this chapter).
9.	 Click the Purge button to delete references that are no longer used in your presenta-
tion. Purging will keep the file size small and the presentation running fast.
TIP  References are shown similar to the details view in a file explorer. Click on the File 
Name, Status, and Insertion Date headers to sort the files.
Units Tab
The Units tab is where you indicate the type of measurement units to use, as well as the 
level of precision or accuracy (Figure 10.8).
Figure 10.8  The Units tab

169
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
1.	 Click the Format drop-down menu to choose decimal or fractional.
2.	 Click on the next drop-down menu to set the default units of the current presenta-
tion to Inches, Feet, Millimeter, Centimeter, Meter, or Points.
3.	 Click on the Precision drop-down menu to set the precision of the units used. Frac-
tional units can be displayed at a precision from 1g to 1/64g. Decimal units can be 
displayed at precisions up to .01g.
Preferences Window
The Preferences window is where you set up your system preferences for LayOut. It contains 
the default settings that will be the same every time you open LayOut, regardless of which 
presentation you open or start new. To adjust the settings, click the Edit (LayOut in Mac) 
drop-down menu and choose Preferences.
Applications Tab
The Applications tab contains the settings for default programs (Figure 10.9). These 
programs will launch automatically when you right-click on a reference and choose Edit from 
the right-click menu or from the References tab in the Document Setup window.
Figure 10.9  The Applications tab

170
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
1.	 Set the Default Image Editor to your favorite image editor, such as Adobe Photoshop.
TIP  GIMP is a free and very powerful image editor available at www.gimp.org.
2.	 Set the Default Text Editor to your favorite text editor, such as Microsoft Word.
TIP  OpenOffice is a free and very powerful word processor available at www.openoffice.org.
Backup Tab
You can use the BackUp settings to keep your work safe by creating additional files and 
automatically saving your work in case a file crashes or is corrupted (Figure 10.10).
Figure 10.10  The Backup tab
1.	 The Create Backup File When Saving feature will create a duplicate of the file prefixed 
with BACKUP_. Even though using this feature requires double the storage space, it pro-
vides extra piece of mind in case of a catastrophic crash or a corrupt file.
2.	 When the Auto-Save Every box is checked, your presentation is saved automatically at 
a set interval of time. 
3.	 Typically, five minutes is reasonable.

171
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Folders Tab
Add your own Template and Scrapbook collections to be accessed in LayOut (Figure 10.11). 
By default, the collections folders are already pathed (referenced) to the program files 
provided by LayOut, now add your own folder locations.  This will give you easy access to 
your custom title blocks, templates, and scrapbooks.
Figure 10.11  The Folders tab
1.	 Templates are displayed in the Getting Started window on the New tab. They can be 
title blocks, plain paper, or graph paper. You can add more locations by clicking on 
the plus sign (+).
2.	 Click on the minus sign (–) to remove a selected folder from the Templates collection.
3.	 Click the Restore Defaults button to go back to the LayOut default folders.
4.	 The Scrapbooks folder contents are displayed in the Scrapbooks Inspector. Scrap-
books are LayOut presentations that contain prebuilt pieces of annotation and pal-
ettes for use in other LayOut presentations. Add more locations by clicking on the 
plus sign (+).

172
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
5.	 Click on the minus sign (–) to remove a folder from the Scrapbooks collection.
6.	 Click the Restore Defaults button to go back to the LayOut default folders.
General Tab
The General settings are the catch-all settings that just don’t fit anywhere else (Figure 10.12).
Figure 10.12  The General tab
1.	 When you update a model or make any settings changes that invalidate the previ-
ously rendered image, you will have to re-render your SketchUp model. The Auto 
Render setting, when turned on, will automatically render all viewports that need to 
be rendered.
TIP  The Auto Render setting is also available in the SketchUp Model Inspector.

173
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
2.	 Change the color of the tools by clicking on the color block. This automatically opens 
the Color palette where you can select a color from several different tabs: Wheel, 
RGB, HSB, Grays, Image, and List. Typically, the first three tabs provide the easiest way 
to make the color selection you want.
3.	 Click on the Reset button to go back to the default LayOut tool color.
Presentation Tab
When you are using multiple monitors to make a presentation, you can display the 
presentation on the Same monitor as window, Primary monitor, or the Secondary monitor. 
You can make this selection in the Presentation tab (Figure 10.13).
Figure 10.13  The Presentation tab
Scales Tab
Under the Scales tab, you can manage the available scales at which to render your drawings 
(Figure 10.14).
1.	 The Available Model Scales section lists all of the scales that are available in LayOut.

174
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 10.14  The Scales tab
2.	 Check the Show All Scales by Default check box to list all of the scales in the 
SketchUp Model dialog box. Uncheck the Show All Scales by Default check box to 
filter the scales based on the LayOut document’s units setting. Documents using 
metric units will display only metric scales, and documents using imperial units will 
display only imperial scales.
3.	 The Scale Text box displays the name of a scale. This box will fill in automatically 
when you create a new scale; you can decide if you want to rename the scale.
4.	 To add a new custom scale, such as 1f = 1000f-0g, click in the Paper text box and 
enter 1 (the paper distance). Set the units as inches.
5.	 In the Model text box, define how the paper relates to the model space. Enter 1000 
in the Model text box and choose ft as the units.
6.	 Click the Add Custom Scale button to finish.
7.	 To delete any scales that you do not need, click on the unwanted scale and then click 
the Delete Scale button. Hold down the Ctrl key to make multiple selections, or hold 
down the Shift key to select everything between two selections, then click the Delete 
Scale button.

175
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Shortcuts Tab
You can add keyboard shortcuts to expedite the drafting process in LayOut (Figure 10.15).
Figure 10.15  The Shortcuts tab
1.	 To help locate what you are looking for faster, enter a command into the filter.
2.	 Using the bar on the right side, scroll down to see all of the commands that are eli-
gible for a keyboard shortcut.
3.	 Enter the desired shortcut key into the text box. Use modifier keys such as Ctrl, Alt, 
and Shift to make several variations of one key.
4.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to add the current shortcut.
5.	 To remove an already assigned shortcut, select a command that already has a short-
cut and then click on the minus sign (–).
TIP  See Chapter 11, “The Professional’s LayOut Environment,” for tips on adding 
custom keyboard shortcuts and optimizing the LayOut interface.

176
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Startup Tab
Upon first opening LayOut, you can tell it what to do to get started (Figure 10.16).
Figure 10.16  The Startup tab
1.	 Upon opening, you can tell LayOut what to do to get started. Choose Create a New 
Document, Re-open Files from Last Session, or Don’t Do Anything. The settings you 
choose in the Startup tab are really based on your personal preferences.
2.	 The self-explanatory Automatically Check for Updates setting is a good one to turn 
on so your software is always current.
3.	 Once LayOut is open, you can tell LayOut what to do when you start a New Docu-
ment. Choose from Open “Getting Started” (opens the window), Create a New Blank 
Document, and Use Default Template to Create a New Document (selects the default 
you’ve indicated).

177
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Inspectors
Inspectors give you full control over LayOut’s geometry, viewports, and annotations. Take a 
moment to become familiar with all of the LayOut Inspectors. All Inspectors are accessed 
from the Window drop-down menu in LayOut.
Colors Inspector
The Colors Inspector does not stand alone; it mainly supports the Text Style and Shape Style 
Inspectors, along with any dialogs or menus that require a color selection (Figure 10.17). When 
choosing colors for strokes, fills, and text you will use the Color Selection tools in the Colors 
Inspector.
Figure 10.17  The Colors Inspector
1.	 The sample color from Screen tool allows you to match the active color to any pixel 
on your screen.
2.	 The Active Color Selection box displays the results from the Color Pickers.
3.	 This Inspector box has six tabs that accomplish the same goal of selecting a color: 
Wheel, RGB, HSB, Grays, Image, and List. Each tab allows you to mix and create using 
different properties of colors, although typically the first three are the easiest to use.
4.	 Click and drag your color selection to the white squares at the bottom of the Colors 
Inspector to create a collection of favorite colors for easy use in any LayOut presenta-
tion. These favorites are local to your machine and will be available for every LayOut 
presentation that you open.

178
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Shape Style Inspector
The Shape Style Inspector is where you change the appearance of shapes and lines 
(Figure 10.18). If an entity is selected, modifying the shape style will affect the selection. If no 
entity is selected, modifying the shape style will set the current tool’s Shape Style defaults.
Figure 10.18  The Shape Style Inspector
1.	 When an entity is selected, you can toggle on the fill and stroke. Fill refers to the color 
within the shape. Stroke refers to the line surrounding the shape as well as any single 
lines (Figure 10.19). In Figure 10.18, the Fill is toggled off and the Stroke is toggled on, 
indicated by the blue highlight on the button.
Figure 10.19  Stroke and Fill

179
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
2.	 Click on the Fill or Stroke color to modify it within the Colors Inspector. In Fig-
ure 10.18, the Stroke color is active in the Colors Inspector, indicated by the darker 
box around the color swatch.
3.	 Change the stroke thickness by clicking on the Stroke Thickness drop-down menu. 
Select a stroke thickness from the list or type in your own number and press Enter.
4.	 Assign dashes to a stroke by selecting a dashes pattern from the Dashes drop-down 
menu. A Dash pattern must be assigned to choose a dash’s Scale.
5.	 Adjust the Dash pattern’s length interval with the dash’s Scale drop-down menu. 
Select a dash’s Scale from the list, or type in your own number and press Enter.
6.	 Stroke Style refers to the visual properties of the edges around the shape. Corners can 
be set to miter, round, or beveled. Ends can be set to flat, round, or square. Miter cor-
ners with flat ends will typically give you the most desired effects.
7.	 You can adjust the Start Arrow and End Arrow lines by clicking on the drop-down 
menu and selecting from several arrow types.
8.	 Adjust the size of an arrow by clicking on the Arrow Scale drop-down menu with 
numbers. Select an Arrow Scale from the list, or type in your own number and press 
Enter.
SketchUp Model Inspector
The SketchUp Model Inspector provides settings that affect the manner in which SketchUp 
Models are displayed in LayOut. The SketchUp Model Inspector has two tabs: View and Styles.
View Tab
The View tab contains the settings to adjust what is shown in the selected viewport as well 
as how it is shown (Figure 10.20). The most effective workflow is to first create scenes in 
SketchUp that already have all of the camera view, style, and shadow properties assigned. 
Then in LayOut, select a scene from the View tab within the SketchUp Model Inspector. You 
must select a viewport in order to use the SketchUp Model Inspector to modify a viewport’s 
properties.
1.	 Use the Scenes drop-down menu to choose from scenes already created in the 
SketchUp model. Using Scenes gives you the most control over a viewport and is by 
far the best method to use for this workflow.

180
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 10.20  The SketchUp Model Inspector’s View tab
2.	 Use the Standard Views drop-down menu to access top, bottom, front, back, left, and 
right views.
3.	 With the viewport selected, click on the Ortho button to toggle between perspective 
and parallel projection views.
4.	 Click on the Scale drop-down menu to assign an architectural scale to the selected 
viewport. A viewport must be selected and Ortho must be on in order to assign a scale.
5.	 The Preserve Scale on Resize button will keep your drawing at the scale regardless of 
how you modify the viewport. When this check box is unchecked, the drawing will 
change scale to match the modified viewport.
TIP  Scale a viewport about the center by holding down the Alt key (Command on 
Mac) and clicking and dragging on the perimeter.  Scaling about the center overrides 
the “Preserve Scale on Resize” setting.
6.	 Click the Shadows button to display shadows in the selected viewport. You can mod-
ify the shadows by adjusting the time of day and date.
7.	 Click the Fog button to display fog in the selected viewport. Click on the color 
swatch to change the color of the fog, or check the Use Background Color box to set 
the fog color to be the same as the Style’s background.
TIP  LayOut has limited Shadow and Fog settings. For the best results, create a scene 
in SketchUp with the desired view, as well as the desired Shadow and Fog settings, 
and then assign the scene to a viewport in LayOut.

181
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Styles Tab
The Styles tab gives you access to any style in your model and even in your Styles library 
(Figure 10.21).
Figure 10.21  The SketchUp Model Inspector’s Styles tab
1.	 Click on the house icon to navigate through the In Model styles. Also, use the drop-
down menu to navigate through your entire Styles library.
2.	 Change the style applied to a viewport by first selecting the viewport and then click-
ing on a style within the Styles tab.
3.	 Display the Styles in list view or thumbnail view, depending on your personal preference.
4.	 Click on the Background check box to fill in the background of a viewport. This 
means that nothing behind the viewport will be visible through the images in the 
foreground. This setting comes into play when you are creating a collage of several 
views and models and do not want the sky or background to show.
5.	 An exclamation mark on a yellow triangle next to the Render button indicates that a 
viewport needs to be rendered. To render a viewport, select the viewport and then 
click on the Render button in the SketchUp Model Inspector. Once the viewport is 
rendered, the Render button will change to Rendered.
6.	 Check the Auto check box to automatically render all viewports when they are out  
of date. This setting is also available in the Preferences dialog on the General tab.
7.	 Change the overall line weight applied to the selected viewport by entering a new number.
8.	 To change the rendering settings of a selected viewport, click on the Rendering Set-
tings drop-down menu and choose Raster, Vector, or Hybrid.

182
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Line Weight Theory
The number you enter into the Line Weight field is the thinnest line that will be displayed in 
the viewport. Any profiles, section cuts, or depth cues will be multiplied by this number to 
thicken them up (Figure 10.22). For instance, if the section cuts are set to 3, the profiles are 
set to 2, and the viewport Line Weight is set to .25; the thinnest lines will be .25, the profiles 
will be .5, and the section cuts will be .75.
Figure 10.22  A line weight in LayOut is the product of the multipli-
ers assigned to styles in SketchUp, combined with the line weight 
assigned to the viewport in LayOut.

183
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
You will need to adjust this number based on the detail in your drawing as well as the 
size and scale of your drawing. The topic of line weights and stacking viewports is covered in 
Chapter 20, “Construction Documents.”
Rendering Settings Theory
LayOut provides expanded rendering settings. You should set each viewport to render 
independently of the next as a vector, raster, or hybrid. Raster is ideal for anything heavy 
with texture images (Figure 10.23), and Vector is ideal for large, high-resolution prints of fairly 
simple line drawings (Figure 10.24). A hybrid combines both styles for a composite view with 
vector linework and raster texture images (Figure 10.25). Keep in mind that hybrid rendering 
can often take up to twice as long to complete. 
Figure 10.23  The Raster rendering setting is best utilized on viewports with complex styles 
and texture images.

184
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 10.24  The Vector rendering setting is best utilized on viewports representing CAD-
style black-and-white output.
Figure 10.25  The Hybrid setting is best utilized on viewports that have fairly simple styles with 
straight lines, combined with texture images and shadows.

185
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
Dimension Style Inspector
The Dimension Style Inspector gives you full control over dimensions (Figure 10.26). Use it 
to set the default properties for the Dimension tool. Also, you can select a dimension and 
modify the properties of the selection within the Dimension Style Inspector.
Figure 10.26  The Dimension Style Inspector
1.	 Adjust the placement of the dimension text as either above, center, or below the 
dimension line.
2.	 Set the dimension text orientation to either vertical, horizontal, aligned, or perpen-
dicular. Typically, dimensions are best shown aligned.
3.	 Toggle whether or not the units are displayed at the end of the dimension text.
4.	 Auto Scale will automatically set the dimension scale, depending on the scale 
assigned to the viewport you click on with the Dimension tool.
5.	 When the Auto Scale feature is turned off, you can set the Dimension Scale manually.
6.	 Length can be displayed as Decimal, Architectural, Engineering, or Fractional.
7.	 The unit type can be set to Inches, Feet, Millimeters, Centimeters, Meters, or Points 
only when the Length value is set to Decimal.
8.	 The Precision of the dimensions can be set to 1/64g or .01g, the same precision toler-
ances used in SketchUp.
9.	 Angular dimensions can be set to radians or degrees. The precision tolerances can be 
set up to .01 degrees or .0001 radians. The Angular Dimension tool must be activated 
to adjust these settings.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  The  visual properties of dimension lines are set within the Shape Style Inspector. 
Activate the Dimensions tool, and then set the default stroke thickness, arrow type, 
arrow scale, and color within the Shape Style Inspector.
Text Style Inspector
The Text Style Inspector has a familiar interface that is used in most word processors and 
email programs (Figure 10.27). Activate the Text tool and then use the Text Style Inspector 
to set the default text properties. You can also select a piece of text within a text box and 
modify the properties of the selection with the Text Style Inspector.
Figure 10.27  The Text Style Inspector
1.	 In LayOut you can access any font that is loaded in your system fonts. Choose a font 
family, typeface, and size. Keep in mind that you can select from the Size list or manu-
ally enter a font size that is not listed.
2.	 You can apply an underline and/or a strikethrough to text.
3.	 Click on the color swatch to modify the text color. This automatically opens the Col-
ors Inspector where you can select a color. The active swatch will have a darker box 
around it, as shown in Figure 10.27.
4.	 Justify the text to the left, center, or right of the Text window.

187
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
5.	 Anchor the text to the top, middle, or bottom of the Text window.
6.	 Text in LayOut can be either bounded or unbounded. Bounded text is contained 
within a window and will drop to the next line as it approaches the boundary of the 
Text window. Unbounded text runs straight across the screen uninterrupted.
Pages Inspector
The Pages Inspector is where you manage the pages in your presentation (Figure 10.28).
Figure 10.28  The Pages Inspector
1.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to add a new page.
2.	 Click on the minus sign (–) to delete the current page.
3.	 Click on the Duplicate Page button to make a copy of the current page. You’ll be 
using this button frequently to create new pages and at the same time copy annota-
tion pieces of the title block from page to page. Once a page is duplicated, it is easier 
to just erase what you don’t need.
4.	 Display the pages in list view or thumbnail view. Typically, list view is sleeker and 
allows you to see more of the pages in your presentation.
5.	 The current page is highlighted in blue. Double-click on a page name to rename the 
page. Click and drag a page to reposition it within your presentation.
6.	 Click on the monitor icon to the right of the page name to toggle whether or not 
that page is included in the screen presentation.

188
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  Right-click on the page to see a context menu. This also allows you to move the 
page up or down, rename the page, duplicate it, and choose whether or not to include 
the page in your screen presentation.
Layers Inspector
Layers in LayOut are similar to most page-creation software in that they control what is 
shown on top by the layer order, as well as what layers are visible. You manage layers in the 
Layers Inspector (Figure 10.29).
Figure 10.29  The Layers Inspector
1.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to add a new layer.
2.	 Click on the minus sign (–) to delete the selected layer. If you delete a layer with entities on 
it, you will be prompted to delete the entities completely or move them to the active layer.
3.	 The active layer is highlighted in blue and is also indicated by a pencil icon to the left 
of the layer name.
4.	 A selected entity’s layer is represented by a small box to the left of the layer name.
5.	 Click on the eye icon to toggle the layer visibility on and off. The entities on the layer 
will disappear and reappear. Layer visibility is set on a per-page basis, meaning that if 
you turn a layer off on one page, it is still visible on other pages.
6.	 Click on the padlock icon to lock the layer. Locking a layer prevents the entities on it 
from being deleted or modified. Locking a layer applies across all pages.
7.	 Click on the last icon to toggle whether or not the layer is shared. A shared layer’s 
contents will appear the same on every page. If the contents of a shared layer are 
modified, they will be modified on every page. Repeating entities, such as title blocks 
and guides, should be on a shared layer.

189
Chapter 10: The LayOut Interface
TIP  To change an entity's layer, first make the layer to which you want to move the 
entity active. Next, right-click on the entity and choose Move to Current Layer. Be sure 
to move the active layer back to the desired layer; it is easy to forget this step!
Scrapbooks Inspector
The Scrapbooks Inspector allows you to seamlessly access collections of prebuilt pieces of 
annotation from preloaded libraries as well as your own (Figure 10.30).
Figure 10.30  The Scrapbooks Inspector
1.	 Select a scrapbook collection from the drop-down menu. LayOut comes with several 
scrapbooks that stylistically match the preloaded title blocks.
2.	 Use the arrows next to the Collections drop-down menu to navigate through the 
pages of the scrapbook.
3.	 Click on the Edit button to edit the scrapbook. This automatically opens the 
LayOut scrapbook file. Add, edit, or delete scrapbook pieces, and then close the 

190
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
file and save your changes. The updated scrapbook will appear in the Scrapbook 
Inspector.
4.	 Add a scrapbook by clicking on a Scrapbook symbol in the Scrapbook area, and then 
click in your presentation to place it.
TIP  Scrapbooks aren’t some magical file type buried in LayOut. A scrapbook is simply 
a LayOut file containing lines, shapes, text, and fills grouped together into meaningful 
symbols. You will create and organize your own custom collection of Scrapbooks in 
Chapter 13: “LayOut Collections.”
Instructor Inspector
The Instructor Inspector will help you explore LayOut and find hidden functions buried in 
the tools (Figure 10.31). Activate any tool and you’ll see the instructions for using that tool, 
as well as invaluable modifier keys associated with the tool.

The Professional’s 
LayOut Environment
A 
professional’s work environment is streamlined, logical, and 
organized. LayOut provides a default environment that is great 
for getting started, but ultimately it is not adequate for a professional. 
Fortunately, you can customize the LayOut environment in several 
different ways to make it work best for you. You can customize toolbars, 
optimize system resources, and remove visual clutter. By adding your 
own set of shortcuts, you can even access all of your frequently used 
commands with just a few keystrokes. In this chapter, you will learn how 
to use all of the settings needed to increase productivity, computer 
performance, and quality of design.

193
New Presentation
To get started and create a new presentation, follow the steps detailed here (Figure 11.1).
Figure 11.1  The Getting Started window
1.	 Open LayOut.
2.	 If you see the Getting Started window, move on to the next step; otherwise, click on 
the File drop-down menu and choose New.
3.	 Select Default Templates c Paper c Plain Paper.
4.	 Select the Letter Landscape template.
5.	 Click the Open button to begin.
System Preferences
System preferences do not travel with a model, but they will be the same for every LayOut 
presentation you create on your computer. To set your preferences, click on the Edit (LayOut 
on Mac) drop-down menu and choose Preferences. Take a moment to optimize the System 
Preferences with the following settings.

194
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Applications
LayOut is powerful by itself, but it can also be complemented by external programs that 
exclusively work with text and raster graphics. You can assign external applications to handle 
these text and image files in the Applications tab (Figure 11.2).
1.	 In the Applications tab, click 
the Choose button for the 
Default Image Editor.
2.	 Navigate to and select the 
executable (.exe) file for your 
favorite image editor.
3.	 Click the Open button to 
assign the Default Image 
Editor.
4.	 Repeat steps 1 through 3 for 
the Default Text Editor.
TIP  When you’re navigating to the application shortcut or .exe file, first look on your 
desktop. If you can’t find a shortcut there, you can find it somewhere in the C:/program 
files folder.
Folders
To access your own custom collections in LayOut, add default folders in the Folders Tab by 
following the steps listed here (Figure 11.3).
1.	 Click on the plus sign (+) 
next to Templates, and then 
navigate to and select the 
RESOURCES/TEMPLATES 
folder.
2.	 Click the Open button. Now 
any template added to the 
TEMPLATES folder can be 
accessed from the Getting 
Started window in LayOut.

3.	 Click on the plus sign (+) next to Scrapbooks, and then navigate to and select the 
RESOURCES/SCRAPBOOKS folder.
4.	 Click the Open button. Now any scrapbook file added to the Scrapbooks folder can 
be accessed from the Scrapbooks Inspector.
Auto Render
Rendering is the number one memory hog in LayOut. Depending on the size, complexity, 
and organization of the model, rendering can take a significant amount of time to complete. 
It is important to keep in mind that a clean and organized SketchUp model is the best 
way to shorten rendering times. In addition, it is pertinent to render only at the necessary 
resolution and only when absolutely necessary.
The Auto Render feature allows LayOut to always render a viewport when it is updated 
and needs to be rendered. This is a helpful button to have turned on when you are learning 
to use LayOut; but as your presentations grow and your SketchUp models become more 
detailed, you will want to turn off this setting and manually control rendering (Figure 11.4). 
Consider keeping Auto Render off at all times, and render using your keyboard commands, 
using the SketchUp Model Inspector, or by right-clicking on the presentation background 
and choosing Render Images on Page.
Figure 11.4  Rendering settings optimized
To manually control rendering, follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to the General tab.
2.	 Uncheck the Auto Render check box.

196
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  The Auto Render setting is also available in the SketchUp Model Inspector, where 
it is called Auto. Keep in mind that this setting does not travel with the presentation; it 
is a global setting that applies to every presentation you open in LayOut.
Shortcuts
Just as in SketchUp, keyboard shortcuts will enable you to work faster. Try to avoid using 
the icons on your screen, even if it feels slower at first. Once you learn all of the keyboard 
shortcuts, you will become amazingly faster (Figure 11.5).
Figure 11.5  Use the Shortcuts tab to add keyboard shortcuts 
to your favorite and most-used commands.
1.	 Click on the Shortcuts tab.
2.	 Type Render in the Filter text box. As you are typing, the list will get shorter.
3.	 Click the Render Images in Document command.
4.	 Click in the Shortcut text box at the bottom-left corner of the dialog. Hold down the 
Ctrl and Shift keys, and then press the R key. (The modifier keys will appear in the text 
box.)
5.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to add the shortcut.
Consider adding the helpful keyboard shortcuts in Figure 11.6.

197
Chapter 11: The Professional’s LayOut Environment
Figure 11.6  Suggested keyboard shortcuts
TIP  You can add a simple shortcut such as a letter, or you can add combinations of 
keys by holding down modifier keys such as Alt, Ctrl, and Shift while you press a key. 
The modifier keys give you almost endless possibilities for adding keyboard shortcuts.
Custom Toolbars
The default toolbar is adequate, but a few 
vital buttons are missing from it. Not every 
command has a logical keyboard shortcut; 
to compensate, you can keep a row of tool 
icons on your screen. You can optimize the 
LayOut workspace by building your own 
custom toolbars (Figure 11.7).
1.	 Click on the View drop-down menu 
and choose Toolbars c Customize. 
Click the New button to add a new 
toolbar.
2.	 Name the toolbar DRAWING.
3.	 From the drop-down menu, select 
an initial location for the toolbar. The

exact location doesn’t really matter because you can drag the toolbar and dock and 
undock freely, but Floating makes it easier for you to work on the new toolbar. Click OK.
4.	 Click on the Commands tab 
(Figure 11.8).
5.	 Sort through the categories to 
narrow your search, and select the 
Tools/Lines category.
6.	 Drag the Line command from 
the Commands column into your 
new toolbar.
7.	 Continue adding the desired 
commands to the toolbar. Click 
the Close button when you are 
finished.
Consider turning off the Main toolbar and adding these custom toolbars to your profes-
sional LayOut environment (Figure 11.9):
DRAWING: Line, Rectangle, Circle
ANNOTATION: Text, Leader Text, Dimensions
MODIFICATION: Select, Split, Join, Erase, Style
PRESENTATION: Next Page, Previous Page, Duplicate Page, Delete Page
NAVIGATION: Zoom to fit, Actual Size. .
ALIGN: Top, Bottom, Right, Left, vertically, horizontally.
ARRANGE: Move Backward, Move to Back, Move to Front, Move Forward.

Chapter 11: The Professional’s LayOut Environment
TIP  Right-click on a toolbar and choose Lock the Toolbars. This will hold the toolbars 
in place and remove the draggable lines for docking and undocking. You can always 
right-click on a toolbar again to unlock it.
You can personalize some of the toolbar behaviors on the options tab. Be sure to turn off 
all fades and animations to optimize system performance (Figure 11.10). Activating the Show 
Screen Tips on Toolbars option will be helpful when you’re learning to use a tool. Even more 
valuable is to turn on the Show Shortcut keys in Screen Tips option to remind you of the 
shortcut key.

Trays
Trays allow you to organize the LayOut Inspectors in the Windows operating system 
only. Create custom trays to make specific Inspectors readily available for certain tasks. By 
grouping Inspectors together by task, you can streamline your workflow. Just follow these 
steps (Figure 11.11).

1.	 Click on the Window drop-down menu and choose New Tray.
2.	 Name the new tray PRESENTATION. The PRESENTATION tray will contain every-
thing you need to navigate your LayOut presentation.
3.	 Check the SketchUp Model, Pages, and Layers Inspector check boxes.
4.	 Click the Add button to finish creating the tray.
5.	 Click on the Window drop-down menu and choose New Tray.
6.	 Name the new tray ANNOTATION. The ANNOTATION tray will contain everything 
you need to make annotations in your presentation.
7.	 Check the Colors, Shape Style, Dimension Style, Text Style, and Scrapbooks Inspector 
check boxes.
8.	 Click the Add button to finish creating the tray.
After you’ve created the tray, click the pushpin icon next to the Close button to set the 
tray to auto-hide. Now, when the tray is not in use, it will automatically close and give you 
more working screen space. To access the tray, simply hover on the Tray tab. Click and drag 
on a tray to make it floating, or dock it at the top, bottom, or sides of the LayOut applica-
tion. Now that you know all of the methods, you can organize your screen any way you like.
TIP  If you click on the View drop-down menu and choose Restore Default Workspace, 
you will return to the default LayOut environment and all custom trays and toolbars will 
be deleted.
TIP  If you don't prefer the Auto Hide feature, use the Ctrl+D keyboard shortcut to 
toggle between hiding and unhiding the trays.

Basic LayOut Template
Create a basic, blank layout template to use as a starting point for any new presentations 
or title blocks you make in the future. All of the settings that travel with the file will be 
optimized to ensure that LayOut is running at full speed.
Rendering Quality
Each model has a paper quality setting (Figure 11.12). Set the Edit Quality to Low, which is 
acceptable for the screen resolution. Typically, the Low setting will render everything well 
enough that you can evaluate a model without having to wait for a high-quality render. Set 
the Output Quality to High for exports and presentations. Rendering at a High setting is 
worth the wait when you’re creating the final output.

To optimize the Paper settings, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Document Setup c Paper.
2.	 Click on the Edit Quality drop-down menu and choose Low.
3.	 Click on the Output Quality drop-down menu and choose High.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Layers
Layers in LayOut work in the traditional fashion of stacking and visibility. If a layer is turned 
on, the contents on that layer are visible. If a layer is turned off, the contents on that layer are 
not visible. The stacking order of the layers will determine which entities are on top. So, if a 
layer is on the bottom of the stack, any object on the layers above will cover up the bottom 
layer entities.
There are only three layers that a professional absolutely needs in every presentation; they 
are ANNOTATIONS, DRAWINGS, and TITLE BLOCK.
At the top of the stack is the ANNOTATIONS layer. This layer contains labels, leaders, 
dimensions, text, and lines that further explain drawings and images. Also on the ANNOTA-
TIONS layer is anything within the title block that does not repeat, such as page numbers 
and descriptions. This is typically the most-used layer in LayOut, and it is usually unlocked.
The DRAWINGS layer contains any entity that is inserted into LayOut. This includes 
SketchUp models, images, maps, and photos. Basically, anything that you are going to anno-
tate belongs on the DRAWINGS layer. Typically, you will insert several entities onto the 
DRAWINGS layer, and then lock the layer as you annotate.
The TITLE BLOCK layer is a shared layer 
that contains the presentation graphics (Fig-
ure 11.13). This layer appears on every page of 
your presentation. Repeating graphics, water-
marks, project information, logos, and page 
dividing lines belong on the TITLE BLOCK layer. 
Entities on this layer might be modified at the 
beginning of a project, but the layer typically 
remains locked most of the time.
To create the new layers, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to add another 
new layer. Name the new layer TITLE BLOCK.
2.	 Click on the Share Layer toggle to share the layer.
3.	 To lock the layer, click on the padlock next to the layer name.
4.	 Click on the plus sign (+) again to add another new layer. Name the new layer 
DRAWINGS.
5.	 To lock the layer, click on the padlock next to the layer name.
Figure 11.13  Within the Layers Inspec-
tor, add the suggested default layers in 
LayOut.

203
Chapter 11: The Professional’s LayOut Environment
6.	 Within the Layers Inspector, click on the plus sign (+) to add a new layer. Name the 
new layer ANNOTATIONS.
Now that you have optimized the presentation, 
save it at this clean, blank state to use for creating 
new presentations and title blocks in the future 
(Figure 11.14).
Just follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and 
choose Save as Template. Name the presen-
tation BIC_8.5 x 11 – Landscape.
3.	 Select the RESOURCES/TEMPLATES folder.
4.	 Click the OK button. Now this template will 
be available every time you start a new pre-
sentation in LayOut.

LayOut Tools
L
ayOut has a simple, sleek toolset, but don’t let the simplicity fool you! 
With the toolset, you can accurately create any shape you would 
ever need. It is deceptively simple. Every tool is described in detail in this 
chapter. Take a few minutes to read the description for each one, open a 
blank presentation, and then perform the steps following the description 
to practice using the tool.
Navigating LayOut
LayOut is essentially a hybrid 2D page-creation and drafting software package. The best 
way to navigate the 2D LayOut environment is to use a three-button scroll-wheel mouse 
(Figure 12.1). Push down on the scroll-wheel to pan up, down, left, and right. Roll the scroll-
wheel toward the screen to zoom in, and roll away from the screen to zoom out. Just as in 
SketchUp, the focal point of your navigation is your cursor.
Figure 12.1  When you use a three-button scroll-wheel mouse, 
the Navigation tools in LayOut are always at your fingertips.

205
Drawing Tools
Use the Drawing tools to add geometry, symbols, annotations, title blocks, and decorations 
to your LayOut presentation. Each of the Drawing tools has additional features and options 
buried within it. Pay special attention to the modifier keys and specific processes required to 
effectively use all of the functions of the tools in LayOut.
Default Settings
When you activate any of the Drawing tools, the Drawing tool’s default settings are 
displayed in the Shape Style Inspector. By adjusting the properties in the Shape Style 
Inspector, you can change the default settings for any tool that draws lines and fills. Test the 
new default properties of the Drawing tools by switching to the Text tool, and then go back 
to any Drawing tool. You will see the settings switch back when you change tools.
All of the Drawing tools share the same default settings. For instance, if you change the 
default fill for the Rectangle tool, this fill will also apply to circles, lines, and polygons.
Use the Pick Style tool to set the default settings for any tool. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Activate any Drawing tool.
2.	 Hover on a scrapbook and click to match the current tool’s default settings to the 
selected scrapbook’s settings. (See Chapter 13, “LayOut Collections,” for more infor-
mation on using scrapbooks as time-saving palettes.)
3.	 To match an entity in the presentation area, press the S key, which is the default 
shortcut for the Pick Style tool.
4.	 Click on an entity to match the current tool’s Inspector settings to the entity that 
you sampled. The entity can be in the presentation space or in a scrapbook.
TIP  A tool's default settings are some of those “buried” features in LayOut. It may 
not be quite clear how to use the default settings when you first attempt to use them. 
Patiently studying and practicing so you can fully understand how the default settings 
operate will save you a tremendous amount of time in the future.
Lines
Use the Line tools to create straight lines, curved lines, and freehand lines. Generating lines is a 
key component of drawing, and there is no exception in LayOut. The Line tools will help you 

206
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
create annotations, title blocks, schedule grids, tables, ground lines, details, and many other 
entities. Take a moment to explore all of the methods for drawing different types of lines.
Straight Lines
The simplest type of line to create is a straight line (Figure 12.2).
Figure 12.2  Create straight lines using the Line tool.
1.	 Activate the Line tool and set the stroke width to 1. Turn on the Fill and set the color 
to Gray. Click once in the presentation area to start.
2.	 Move your cursor to the right along the red axis, and click again to finish the 
segment.
3.	 Move your cursor up on the green axis. Note that the Line tool has Fill properties. This 
time, let go of the mouse and type a precise dimension, such as 4, then press Enter.
4.	 Move your cursor back to the left along the red axis. Note that there is an inference 
engine. To finish the line segment, click where the inference line meets the active line.
5.	 Move your cursor back down on the green axis, and click on the starting point to 
finish.

207
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
TIP  Press the Esc key at any time to cancel the current line segment. This will also 
cancel just about any command in LayOut.
Once a segment is finished, you can click on an endpoint with the Line tool to continue 
the segment. You will see the previous line segments light up blue, indicating that you are 
continuing that segment. Follow the previous steps to continue the straight line segment.
TIP  The inference engine in LayOut allows you to snap to and encourage inferences from 
endpoints, midpoints, and edges. It is very similar to the inference engine in SketchUp.
Curved Line
You aren’t limited to straight lines. Using the Line tool, you can also create curves (Figure 12.3).
Figure 12.3  Create a curved line using the Line tool.
1.	 Click and drag away from the starting point to define the tangent line.
2.	 Release the cursor to set the curve’s tangent line relative to the starting point.
3.	 Double-click to finish the line segment. 
Instead of double-clicking to finish the line, click and drag again to continue the curved 
line segment.
Click and drag on an endpoint of a completed line to continue a curved line segment. 
The existing line segment will light up blue, indicating that you are continuing that segment.
TIP  To add a straight line segment to a curved line, single-click to finish the curved 
line segment, then continue to single click to add straight lines. To add a curved line 
segment to a straight line, you can click and drag to finish the straight line segment 
and add a curved line segment.

208
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Freehand Tool
Use the Freehand tool to create sketchy, loose, 
and organic forms (Figure 12.4). This tool is ideal 
for complementing drawings, tracing topography, 
creating sketchy annotations, and creating unique 
geometry.
1.	 Activate the Freehand tool. Click and drag 
to draw a loose and sketchy line.
2.	 Release the click to finish the line.
Click and drag on an endpoint to continue 
the freehand line segment. The previous line seg-
ments will light up blue, indicating that you are 
continuing that segment.
Rectangles
LayOut’s Rectangle tools enable you to draw rectangles and squares that are always on axis 
and in line with the paper (Figure 12.5). In addition to a traditional rectangle, LayOut has 
several types of rectangles: lozenged, bulged, and rounded. Each type has its own tool icon 
and each operates as described here.
Figure 12.5  The Rectangle tool
Figure 12.4  The Freehand tool

209
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
To draw a rectangle, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Rectangle tool. Click once in the presentation area to start the rectangle.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the starting point to suggest a direction. Click once to 
loosely define the dimensions of the rectangle.
3.	 At this point, you can enter a precise dimension, such as 3,5, then press Enter.
The other types of rectangles function exactly the same way (Figure 12.6).
Figure 12.6  Other types of Rectangle tools
A rounded rectangle has radiused corners. Activate the Rounded Rectangle tool, or the 
Rectangle tool, and then press the Up and Down arrow keys to change the radius. To enter a 
precise radius, type in the desired radius followed with an “r,”—for example, type 1/2r, then 
press Enter. This will set the corners to be 1/2g radius.
A lozenged rectangle has half circles at the long ends of the rectangle, so a square would 
actually appear as a circle. Ultimately, the Lozenged Rectangle tool creates a pill shape.
A bulged rectangle has arcs at the left and right side of the rectangle. Use the Up and 
Down arrow keys to adjust the bulge of the arcs. After you adjust the bulge, you can enter 
precise dimensions by typing a value and then pressing the Enter key.
There are also several modifier keys that apply to all types of rectangles. Hold down the 
Shift key to constrain any rectangle to a square. Hold down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to 
create the rectangle about the center point. Use the Up and Down arrow keys to adjust the 
rounded corners, or lozenged and bulged sides.
TIP  LayOut’s Measurements box is just like SketchUp’s. The Measurements box is 
always waiting for your input and constantly switches the value, depending on which 
tool is active and the input LayOut needs to operate effectively.

210
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Arcs
There are several methods for drawing an 
arc in LayOut. The one you use will depend 
on your personal preference and previous 
experience with other drafting programs. 
The most familiar method probably will be 
the 2-Point Arc tool because it is the one 
most similar to the Arc tool in SketchUp. 
Take a moment to explore all of the tools 
for drawing arcs.
Arc Tool
Using the Arc tool, you can create the outside of a pie chart with ease (Figure 12.7).
To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Arc tool. Click once in the presentation area to define the center point.
2.	 Move your cursor to the right along the red axis to suggest a direction. Click again to 
define the start point of the arc.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the start point and click once more to loosely define the 
endpoint of the arc.
4.	 At this point, you can let go of the mouse and type a precise angle, such as 180, then 
press Enter.
2-Point Arc Tool
The most familiar arc tool is strikingly similar to the Arc tool in SketchUp  
(Figure 12.8).
To create an arc with the 2-Point 
Arc tool, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the 2-Point Arc tool. 
Click once in the presenta-
tion area to define the start 
point.  Move your cursor 
away from the center point 
to suggest a direction.
Figure 12.7  The Arc tool
Figure 12.8  The 2-Point Arc tool

211
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
2.	 Click again to define the endpoint of the arc, or enter a precise distance and press 
Enter.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the endpoint and click once more to loosely define the 
bulge of the arc, or type a precise length, such as 3, then press Enter.
3-Point Arc Tool
Using the 3-Point Arc tool, you can draw arcs about a pivot point (Figure 12.9).
To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the 3-Point Arc tool. Click 
once in the presentation area to 
define the start point.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the 
start point to suggest a direction 
and click again to define the pivot 
point of the arc.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the 
pivot point and click once more to 
define the length of the arc.
Pie Tool
With the Pie tool, you can fill in pie charts and recreate iconic video game characters with 
ease (Figure 12.10).
Figure 12.10  The Pie tool
Figure 12.9  The 3-Point Arc tool

212
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Just follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Pie tool. Click once in the presentation area to define the center point of 
the arc.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the center point, let go of the mouse, and type a precise 
radius such as 2, then press Enter.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the start point; you can move in either direction, clock-
wise or counterclockwise.
4.	 Either click once more to loosely define the endpoint of the arc, or let go of the 
mouse and type a precise angle such as 300, then press Enter.
Circles
Circles, ellipses, and polygons are all created the same way. Unlike SketchUp, there are true 
vector circles in LayOut, so there is no need to enter the number of sides.
Circle Tool
Use the Circle tool to draw circles  
(Figure 12.11).
Just follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Circle tool. Click once 
to define the center point of the 
circle.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the 
center point to define the radius 
and click to loosely define the radius 
of the circle.
3.	 At this point, you can type a precise 
radius, such as 2, then press Enter.
Ellipse Tool
The Ellipse tool is a variation of the Circle tool that creates ellipses (Figure 12.12). This tool 
operates very much like the Rectangle tool. You can also create ellipses by drawing a circle, 
and then using the Select tool and Scale grips to distort it.
Figure 12.11  The Circle tool

213
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
To create an ellipse, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Activate the Ellipse tool. Click 
once to define the start point of 
the ellipse.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the 
start point and click to loosely 
define the dimensions of the 
ellipse.
3.	 At this point you can type the 
precise dimensions, such as 3,2, 
then press Enter.
The Ellipse tool also has modifier keys. Hold down the Shift key while creating an ellipse 
to constrain it to a circle. Hold down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to create the ellipse 
about a center point.
Polygon Tool
The Polygon tool creates geometric shapes with a defined number of sides (Figure 12.13).
1.	 Activate the Polygon tool. Upon activating the Polygon tool, immediately enter the 
desired number of sides and press Enter—for example, type 5s, then press Enter.
2.	 Click once to define the center 
point of the polygon.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the 
center point and click to loosely 
define the radius of the polygon.
4.	 At this point, you can type a precise 
radius, such as 2, then press Enter.
The Polygon tool also has modifier keys. 
Hold down the Shift key to lock the sides 
of the polygon to an axis. Hold down the 
Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to create a dis-
torted polygon, similar to what you would 
create with the Ellipse tool.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Annotation Tools
Annotation tools give you the ability to explain the graphics in your 2D presentation.  Add 
captions, leader text, and dimensions to provide another level of information.
Default Settings
When you activate any of the Annotation tools, the default settings will appear in the 
corresponding Inspectors. The Text tool, Label tool, and Dimension tool have default 
settings in the Text Style Inspector and the Shape Style Inspector. In addition to these 
Inspectors, the Dimension tool has default settings in the Dimension Style Inspector. You 
can change the default settings manually by going through each setting in the Text Style, 
Shape Style, and Dimension Style Inspectors while the corresponding tools are active.
Unlike the Drawing tools, each of the Annotation tools has its own independent default 
settings. For example, if you change the default font for the Text tool, the text displayed 
when you create labels or dimensions will not be affected.
Use the Pick Style tool to set the default settings for any tool. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Activate any Annotation tool.
2.	 To match the current tool’s default settings to a specific scrapbook, hover over the 
scrapbook and click it. (See Chapter 13 for more information about how scrapbooks 
can be used as time-saving palettes.)
3.	 To match an entity in the presentation area, tap the S key. This is the default shortcut 
for the Pick Style tool.
4.	 Click on an entity to match the current tool’s Inspector settings to the entity that 
you sampled. The entity can be in the presentation space or in a scrapbook.
Text Tool
LayOut has two types of text: bounded and unbounded (Figure 12.14). Bounded text is a 
constrained text window. As the text reaches the border, it will automatically drop the text 
to the next line if a word will not fit. Unbounded text will just keep going across the page 
indefinitely as you type, with no boundary or end.
Figure 12.14  The same text shown as unbounded and bounded

215
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
Typically, unbounded text is used for drawing titles, page numbers, and short bursts of 
text. Bounded text is better suited for larger amounts of text, such as project descriptions 
and notes.
To create unbounded text, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Text tool. Click once to create an unbounded Text window.
2.	 Enter the desired text in the text box. It will continue across the page with no 
boundaries.
3.	 To finish, click outside the text box or press the Esc key.
4.	 Using the Select tool, double-click on the text to edit it.
TIP  When a bounded text box is resized, the bounded text is changed to unbounded. Any 
text can be changed back and forth from bounded to unbounded. Right-click on the text 
and choose Make Unbounded or Make Bounded, depending on the setting you need.
To create bounded text, follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Text tool, click and drag to start the Text window (Figure 12.15).
Figure 12.15  When you use the Text tool, the 
direction in which you click and drag assigns the 
justification and anchoring of the Text window.

216
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Move your cursor away from the start point and release it to define the boundaries of 
the Text window.
3.	 Enter the desired text. As the words you type reach the boundary, they will drop to 
the next line.
4.	 To finish, click outside the text box or press the Esc key.
5.	 Using the Select tool, double-click on text to edit it.
TIP  You will see a red arrow on the text box when it is not big enough.  You can 
manually resize the text box or right-click on the text and choose Size to Fit to 
automatically enlarge the text box to fit the text.
Text Properties
The Format tab within the Text Style 
Inspector is where you can change text 
properties. While a text box is selected, you 
can adjust the font family, typeface, type 
size, and color. You can justify the text to 
the left, right, or center. You can also anchor 
the text to the top, bottom, or center of the 
Text window.
All types of text can take on any prop-
erty assigned in the Shape Style Inspector 
(Figure 12.16). You can further modify the 
selected text’s appearance by assigning a fill 
and stroke in the Shape Style Inspector.
Label Tool
The Label tool adds a leader line and 
attaches text to it (Figure 12.17). Keep in 
mind that even though this tool creates 
a “label,” there is no entity defined as a 
label in LayOut. The Label tool creates two 
Figure 12.16  Text with Shape Style  
properties

217
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
simple entities at the same time, a piece of unbounded text and a line—each with its own 
Shape Style properties.
To create a leader line with text, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Label tool. Click once to place the 
arrow for the leader text.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the arrow and click 
again to place the text.
3.	 Enter the desired text.
4.	 To finish, click outside the text box or press the  
Esc key.
TIP  The Label tool creates straight leader lines, but those lines can be modified 
into curved leaders, too. Using the Select tool, double-click on a line to edit the line’s 
points. Holding the Ctrl key (Option on Mac), click and drag on an endpoint to curve 
the line. See the “Select Tool” section, later in this chapter, for more information about 
editing lines.
Dimension Tools
Add dimensions to call out lengths and angles and further explain a design. Keep in mind 
that the default settings for dimensions are in several Inspectors; Shape Style, Dimensions 
Style, and Text Style. In LayOut you can create two types of dimensions: Linear (Figure 12.18) 
and Angular (Figure 12.19).
Figure 12.18  Linear dimension
Figure 12.17  The Label tool

218
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
To add linear dimensions to a presentation, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Linear Dimension tool.  Click once to define the start point of the 
dimension.
2.	 Move your cursor to another point and click again to define the endpoint of the 
dimension.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the start and endpoints of the dimension line. Click to 
place the dimension.
Figure 12.19  Angular dimension
To add angular dimensions to a presentation, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Angular Dimension tool. To define the first point of the first leg of the 
angle, click on the first line that you want to dimension.
2.	 Click again on the same line to finish defining the first leg.
3.	 To define the first point of the second leg of the angle, click on the second line that 
you want to dimension.
4.	 Click again on the same line to finish defining the second leg.
5.	 Move your cursor to adjust the arrows, and then click to position the angular dimen-
sion text.

219
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
Dimension Properties
Dimensions in LayOut utilize settings from several Inspectors: Shape Style, Text Style, and 
Dimensions (Figure 12.20). Select a dimension to see all of its properties in the Inspectors.
Figure 12.20  Dimensions have settings in 
the Shape Style, Text Style, and Dimensions 
Inspectors.
Editing Dimensions
Once a dimension has been created, it can be modified. Using the Select tool, double-click 
on a dimension to edit the dimension (Figure 12.21).  

220
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 12.21  Dimension edit mode.
Once in dimension edit mode, follow these steps:
1.	 Click and drag on the text to reposition.
2.	 Triple-click on the text to change the shown dimension.  Although it is discouraged, 
you can change the text displayed to force a dimension. To revert back to the auto-
matically measured text, erase all of the forced text and press the Escape key.
3.	 Click and drag on the extent points to change the distance between the object being 
measured and the dimension line.  This is called the offset.
4.	 To change the length of an extension line, click and drag on an offset point.
5.	 Click and drag on a connection point to change the points being measured, and in 
turn length of the dimension.
TIP  Angular dimensions have a very similar edit mode.
Modification Tools
The Modification tools are used to change geometry that is already created. You can use 
them to move, rotate, copy, split, or join existing geometry to create new complex shapes.
Select Tool
Because it is the most frequently used tool, a safe and helpful habit is to always default to 
the Select tool. The default keyboard shortcut for the Select tool is the spacebar. The Select 
tool does much more than just select entities; it allows you to move, rotate, copy, and edit 
geometry.

221
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
Selecting
The Select tool is used to set up many other operations within LayOut. Because it is so 
important, take the time to become proficient at using it to select entities. Practice these 
steps:
☑
☑Single-click on any entity in LayOut to select it. The selected entity’s properties will be 
displayed in the relevant Inspectors.
☑
☑Hold down the Shift key to add to, subtract from, or inverse a selection.
☑
☑Click and drag to select entities with a Selection window (Figure 12.22).
Figure 12.22  Selection windows
Moving/Copying
Use the Select tool to move and copy entities within LayOut. To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 Select an entity or select multiple entities.
2.	 Click and drag on the selection to move the entities all at once.
3.	 Release the mouse button to finish the move.
4.	 Immediately type a precise distance, such as 5, then press Enter.

222
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
The Move feature of the Select tool also has modifier keys. Use them as follows:
☑
☑Click and drag while holding down the Shift key to lock an axis.
☑
☑Click and drag while holding down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to make a copy. 
☑
☑To encourage inferences and create meaningful relationships between LayOut entities, 
hover endpoints, midpoints, and lines of the entity you are moving on other endpoints, 
midpoints, and lines of entities in your presentation.
TIP  Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge a selected entity 1/64g in the 
desired direction. Hold down the Shift key while nudging to move an entity 1/4g in the 
desired direction.
Precise Moving/Copying
The Precise Move grip allows you to move entities in LayOut with complete control. Use 
a precise move to align drawings, annotations, title blocks, and geometry to make more 
accurate and visually appealing presentations (Figure 12.23).
Just follow these steps:
1.	 Select an entity and notice that the precise 
move grip appears in the middle of the 
selection.
2.	 Click and drag on the left side of the 
Precise Move grip to pick it up. You can 
encourage inferences from the Precise 
Move grip before placing it.
3.	 Release on a meaningful point to put it 
down.
4.	 Click and drag anywhere on the selection 
to move it. 
5.	 Allow the Precise Move grip to snap to 
an inference on another entity. You can 
also encourage inferences from the Precise 
Move grip.
TIP  Hold the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) and Shift key down while performing a precise 
move to create a copy along an axis.
Figure 12.23  A precise move is when 
you move an entity from one specific 
point to another specific point.

223
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
Rotating/Copying
LayOut doesn’t have a dedicated Rotate tool. However, you can accomplish any rotation 
you’ll need with the Precise Move grip, which is the center of any rotation (Figure 12.24). 
Follow these steps:
1.	 Select an entity and notice that the precise 
move grip appears in the middle of the 
selection.
2.	 Click and drag on the left side of the 
Precise Move grip to pick it up.  You can 
encourage inferences from the Precise 
Move grip before placing it.
3.	 Release on a meaningful center point of 
rotation to put it down.
4.	 Click and drag on the right side of the Pre-
cise Move grip to start the rotation.
5.	 Release the mouse button to finish.
6.	 Now you can enter a precise degree of 
rotation, type -45, then press Enter.
TIP  Hold the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) down while rotating any entity to create a copy.
Scaling
Use the Select tool to scale and distort entities in LayOut (Figure 12.25).
Figure 12.25  Scaling an entity in LayOut
Figure 12.24  Rotate

224
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
1.	 Select an entity or multiple entities.
2.	 Click and drag on the Perimeter grips to distort or scale the selection.
3.	 Move your cursor away from the Scale grip and release it to loosely set the new scale.
4.	 Now you can enter a precise scale value, type 2, then press Enter.
TIP  There’s not much space for your cursor between the Move and Scale features. Be 
sure to watch the cursor icon closely to determine which feature you are using.
TIP  Hold the control key (Option on Mac) down while scaling any entity to create a copy.
When you are scaling in LayOut, keeps these points in mind:
☑
☑Hold down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to make a copy while scaling.
☑
☑Hold down the Shift key to constrain the selection’s proportions while scaling.
☑
☑To mirror a selection, scale to –1, or right-click on an entity or selection and choose 
Flip c Top to Bottom or Flip c Left to Right.
Line Editing
Use the Select tool to edit lines and shapes in LayOut. The methods discussed here apply to 
all the geometry in LayOut, including lines, rectangles, circles, arcs, polygons, etc. There are 
several methods for modifying geometry using the Select tool. Double-click on the line or 
entity and then:
☑
☑Click and drag on a point to reposition it, ultimately modifying the geometry.
☑
☑Hold the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) and click along the line to add control points.
☑
☑Drag a control point onto another control point to delete it.

225
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
☑
☑Hold the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) and click and drag control points to curve the line. A 
curve can be created from any point along a line.
☑
☑Click and drag the tangent control points of a curve back to the control point to remove 
the curve, ultimately making the line straight.
Eraser Tool
Use the Eraser tool to delete entities from a presentation (Figure 12.26).
Follow these steps:
1.	 Click once on an entity to erase it.
2.	 Alternatively, hold down the mouse 
button and drag the cursor over the 
entities. All entities will be erased when 
the mouse button is released.
Style Tool
The Style tool is very similar to a “match 
properties” tool in other programs 
Figure 12.26  The Eraser tool

226
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
(Figure 12.27). To use it, sample all of the properties from one entity and in one click apply 
them to another entity.  The style tool can sample from and apply to any combination of 
shapes, edges, viewports, images, text, etc.
Follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Style tool. To sample an 
entity’s style, click on it in a scrap-
book or in the document presenta-
tion area.
2.	 Click on the entities to which 
you want to apply the sampled 
properties.
TIP  Tap the Escape key to start over, or 
hold down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac) to 
sample another entity.
Split Tool
The Split tool divides line segments and also creates breaks between overlapping shapes 
(Figure 12.28). 
Figure 12.28  The Split tool
Figure 12.27  The Style tool

227
Chapter 12: LayOut Tools
To use the Split tool to break LayOut geometry down into simpler forms, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Activate the Split tool. Click on an intersection between the two shapes.
2.	 Click on another intersection between the two shapes. Use the Select tool to exam-
ine the results.
Join Tool
The Join tool glues together lines that share a vertex (Figure 12.29). It is used to combine 
shapes to create more complex geometry.
Figure 12.29  The Join tool
To use it, follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Join tool. Click on the first entity that you would like to join.
2.	 Click on the next entity that you would like to join. Use the Select tool to examine 
the results.

228
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Chapter Points
☑
☑Each group of tools has a specific function. Before you perform an operation, make a 
plan and think it through. Ask yourself, what is the fastest way to complete the task?
☑
☑Using a combination of the Drawing and Modification tools, you can create any shape, 
precise or sketchy, in LayOut.
☑
☑Instead of sorting through several dialogs, use the Pick Style tool to set the defaults for 
your tools.
☑
☑When you execute a command, most of the LayOut tools allow you to enter precise 
dimensions during the command. Some of the LayOut tools allow you to also modify 
the precise dimensions after you execute the command, until another command is 
started.
☑
☑Unlike SketchUp, LayOut is mostly a click-and-drag program.

Chapter 13
LayOut Collections
L
ayOut has two series of collections: title blocks and scrapbooks. 
Customizing, organizing, and using each of these types of collections 
will help you create LayOut presentations more easily and more efficiently. 
By effectively using LayOut collections, you will be able to open your own 
title block and already have your company’s address and logo inserted, 
so you won’t have to keep changing it; Your office’s graphic standards will 
be available at the click of a button, and shared on a network drive where 
everyone can add and contribute. All of this and more is possible with 
LayOut collections.
Templates
Templates can be quite useful for a number of things. They can be very hard-lined traditional 
architectural title blocks, or they can even be optimized for screen presentations. In this 
section, you will create your own customized, architectural title block.
TIP  Once you’ve started making a LayOut presentation with a specific template, you 
won’t be able to switch to a different template. You can, however, modify the new 
presentation to look however you like.

230
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Creating a Title Block Template
Before you can use a title block template, you’ll need to create it. You have already reviewed 
all of the skills and tools you need to do just that. 
Getting Started
Follow these step-by-step instructions to create your own architectural title block.
1.	 Open LayOut and start a new presentation using the BIC_8.5x11 – Landscape 
template.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Document Setup c Grid.
3.	 On the Grid tab (Figure 13.1), turn on the grid and grid snaps. Also adjust the grid to 
1g with four divisions.
4.	 On the Paper tab (Figure 13.2), change the paper size to Tabloid and adjust the mar-
gins to 1/2g.
Figure 13.2  The Document Setup dialog, Paper tab
Adding Lines
To develop a unique graphic style, you’ll need to 
add lines, as indicated here. 
1.	 Activate the Line tool, set the stroke 
width to 3, and turn off the Fill. Click 
once to start the line at the top-right cor-
ner of the margin (Figure 13.3).
Figure 13.1  The Document Setup dialog, Grid tab
Figure 13.3  Use the Shape Style settings 
to create the margin lines.

231
Chapter 13: LayOut Collections
2.	 Draw a line along the margins as shown and then double-click on the bottom-left 
corner of the margin to finish the line (Figure 13.4).
Figure 13.4  The main title-block line drawn along the margins
Adding Text
Use the Text tool to add several informational text boxes to your title block (Figure 13.5). 
Once a text box is created, use the Select tool to rotate and place the text.
Figure 13.5  Place text boxes in your title block.

232
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Follow these steps:
1.	 Add a text box for your office name and contact information. Rotate and position the 
text on the title block as shown.
2.	 Add a generic text box for the client’s name and contact information. Rotate and 
position the text on the title block as shown.
3.	 Add a generic text box for the project title and information. Rotate and position the 
text on the title block as shown.
4.	 Add a generic text box for the Sheet Description. Rotate and position the text on the 
title block as shown.
5.	 Add a generic text box for Sheet Information. Position on the title block as shown.
6.	 Add a generic text box for the sheet number. The sheet number text is white with a 
black fill. Position on the title block as shown.
TIP  You can assign different properties to the text in a text box. Double-click in the 
text box and select the top line of text. Within the Text Style Inspector, change the 
selection to bold, independent of the rest of the text in the Text window (Figure 13.6).
Figure 13.6  Text in a text box doesn’t have to have the same 
properties as other text in the text box.

Chapter 13: LayOut Collections
Adding Images
By following these steps, you can add images to your title block.
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Insert.
2.	 Navigate to the TSWFA files and choose the logo.jpg.
3.	 Using the Select tool, rotate, resize, and position the logo image on the title block 
(Figure 13.7).
Figure 13.7  The final title block (image rotated for effect)
Assigning Layers
Add all of the title block entities to the TITLE BLOCK layer. These entities will be the same, 
or repeated, on every page of the presentation (Figure 13.8).
1.	 Set the active layer to TITLE BLOCK.
2.	 Select the entities that will appear on every page of the presentation; title block lines, 
logo, and text boxes.
3.	 Right-click on the selection and choose Move to Current Layer.
4.	 In the Layers Inspector, lock the TITLE BLOCK layer.
Add unique entities of the title block to the ANNOTATIONS layer. These text boxes will 
need to be different on every page of the presentation (Figure 13.8).
1.	 Set the active layer to ANNOTATIONS.
2.	 Select the entities that will be unique on every page of the presentation; Drawing 
Number text box and Sheet Description text box.
3.	 Right-click on the selection and choose Move to Current Layer.

234
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 13.8  Assign red entities to the ANNOTATIONS layer. Assign gray entities to the TITLE 
BLOCK layer.
Saving as a Template
Now that you have created your own title block, you can optimize the settings and save it to 
your collection.
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Document Setup.
2.	 On the Grid tab, turn off the grid.
3.	 On the Paper tab, turn off the margins.
4.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Save as Template.
5.	 Select the RESOURCES/BIC_Templates folder and save it with the name BIC_11x17 
Landscape – Linear.
Now, every time you open LayOut or start a new presentation, this title block will be 
available in the Getting Started window.

235
Chapter 13: LayOut Collections
Scrapbooks
Scrapbooks are prebuilt pieces of annotation, composed of layout geometry and entities. 
Scrapbooks are not a special file format; they are simply layout presentations containing 
layout entities grouped in useful ways. While Scrapbooks serve a functional purpose of 
further explaining a design, they also contribute to the overall graphic style of the drawings. 
Lines, shapes, fills, and fonts all contribute to your own personal graphic standards.
Creating a Scrapbook
You have already reviewed all of the skills and tools that you need to create your own 
scrapbook. Follow these step-by-step instructions to create your own custom scrapbook 
collection to complement the BIC_11x17 Landscape – Linear template.
Getting Started
To get started, simply follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose New. Select the BIC_8.5x11 – Land-
scape template and choose Open.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Document Setup. In the Paper tab, 
change the paper size to 5g n 5g.
3.	 In the Pages Inspector, double-click 
on the only page and rename it 
SYMBOLS. Click on the plus sign (+) 
to add two more pages. Name the 
pages CALLOUTS and PALETTES 
(Figure 13.9).
4.	 In the Layers Inspector, delete the 
TITLE BLOCK layer because you don’t

Rename the DRAWINGS layer to 
BACKGROUND. Rename the ANNO-
TATIONS layer to SCRAPBOOKS 
and leave it as the current layer 
(Figure 13.10).

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  When you insert a scrapbook, all of its entities are assigned to the active layer in 
the current presentation. This is why it is pointless to have several different layers in a 
scrapbook.
Symbols
Symbols are used to add graphic and text information to a drawing. They can be used to count 
doors and windows, as well as define north and the graphic scale of a drawing. In this section, 
you will create several commonly used symbols for creating a set of construction documents.
Door Tag
Door tags are used to count new doors, and reference them to the additional information 
provided in the door schedule. Follow these steps to create a simple door tag:
1.	 Activate the Circle tool, set the stroke width to .5, and turn off the Fill. Click once to 
define the center point of the circle (Figure 13.11).
2.	 Move your cursor away from the center point and click to loosely define the radius.
3.	 Immediately type a precise radius of 1/8, then press Enter.
4.	 Activate the Text tool. While you hold down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac), click and 
hold on the center point of the circle (Figure 13.12).
5.	 Move your cursor away from the center point to create the text box, and release the 
mouse button to finish. Add generic text to the text box, such as “01”, and press Esc 
to finish.
Figure 13.11  Create a precise circle for the  
door tag.
Figure 13.12  Add text to the 
door tag.

6.	 Activate the Select tool, click and drag from 
right to left to select both the circle and the 
text entities as shown in Figure 13.13.
7.	 Right-click on the selection and choose 
Group.
TIP  If a piece of annotation in a scrapbook 
contains more than one entity, those entities  
must be grouped for the entire symbol to come in 
as one.
Window Tag
Window tags are used to count new windows, and reference them to the additional 
information provided in the window schedule. Follow these steps to create a simple window tag:
1.	 Activate the Polygon tool, set the stroke width to .5, and turn off the Fill. Assign the 
number of sides by entering 6s, then press Enter (Figure 13.14).
Figure 13.14  Create a precise polygon for the window tag.

3.	 Move your cursor away from the center point and click to loosely define the radius.
4.	 Type a precise radius of 1/8, then press Enter.
5.	 Activate the Text tool. Hover on the 
top and side center points to encourage 
an inference. While holding the Ctrl key 
(Option on Mac), click and hold on the 
inferenced center point of the hexagon 
(Figure 13.15).
6.	 Move your cursor away from the center 
point to create the text box. Release the 
mouse button to finish. Add generic text to 
the text box , such as “A”, and press Esc to 
finish.
7.	 Activate the Select tool. Click and drag from 
right to left to select both the circle and the 
text entities.
8.	 Right-click on the selection and choose Group so it functions properly as a scrapbook 
(Figure 13.16).

once to define the center point of the circle (Figure 13.17).
2.	 Move your cursor away from the center point and click to loosely define the radius.
3.	 Immediately type a precise radius of 1/4, then press Enter.
4.	 Activate the Line tool and set the stroke width to 3. Click once on the center point of 
the circle to start the line (Figure 13.18).
5.	 Move your cursor away from the start point of the line and double-click on the top 
point of the circle to finish.
6.	 Select both entities, and then right-click and choose Group so that it functions prop-
erly as a scrapbook.
Graphic Scale
A graphic scale gives the viewer of the drawing a visual reference for the architectural scale 
applied to the drawing. Follow these steps to create a simple graphic scale:
1.	 Activate the Rectangle tool, set the Fill to black, and turn off the Stroke. Click once to 
start the rectangle (Figure 13.19).

Chapter 13: LayOut Collections
Callouts
Callouts are used to link and coordinate drawings. A callout is text that references another 
drawing on another page. Use the Pages Inspector to advance to the Callouts page of your 
scrapbook presentation. Separating the scrapbooks into pages keeps them organized and 
makes them easier to use.
Interior Elevation
An interior elevation callout points at an interior wall and references the actual interior 
elevation with a drawing and sheet number. 
1.	 Activate the Text tool. Set the stroke width to 1, the Fill to white, and the font size 
to 10.

needed (Figure 13.34).
11.	 Select the entire detail callout, right-click on the 
selection, and choose Make Group so that it 
functions properly as a scrapbook.
Palette
You can use a palette scrapbook as a quick way to assign default settings. With most tools, 
you can hover in the Scrapbooks Inspector and match the default properties of the active 
tool to a specific scrapbook. Add these entities to your palette so you can draw much more 
efficiently in LayOut.
TIP  Entities that will never be sampled or inserted into a drawing can be placed on 
a locked layer. For example, the text that describes the scrapbook won’t be imported; 
assign it to the BACKGROUND layer , then lock the BACKGROUND layer.
To  create a palette scrapbook, follow these steps:
1.	 Draw a line approximately 2g long.
2.	 Using the Select tool, hold down the Ctrl key to make a copy, and then hold down 
the Shift key to lock the axis. Click and drag the line down by 1/16g. Copy the line 
10 times as shown in Figure 13.35.
3.	 Select all of the lines, right-click on the selection, and choose Group.
4.	 Add a text box to the right of the group and enter the generic text Description on 
the first line and 0.00 pt on the second line (Figure 13.36).
Figure 13.34  Add text to the 
Detail callout.

9.	 Make the BACKGROUND layer the current layer. Select all of the descriptions, right-
click on the selection, and choose Move to Current Layer.
10.	Lock the BACKGROUND layer. Entities on a locked layer cannot be sampled or 
inserted as a scrapbook.
Saving Scrapbooks
Now that you have created a custom scrapbook, add it to your collections. Just follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Save as Scrapbook.
2.	 Select the RESOURCES/SCRAPBOOKS folder and save it as BIC_Linear.
Now this scrapbook will always be available in the Scrapbooks Inspector collections 
drop-down.
Using Collections
Take a few minutes to experiment with your new creations.
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose New.
2.	 Select the BIC_11x17 Landscape – Linear template that you just created and click 
on Open.
3.	 In the Scrapbooks Inspector, click on the Collections drop-down menu and choose 
the BIC_Linear scrapbook.
Practice adding scrapbooks to your presentation and using scrapbooks as palettes. While 
you’re practicing, keep the following tips in mind:
☑
☑Activate a tool, then hover over a scrapbook and click to absorb the scrapbook's proper-
ties as the tool's default settings.
☑
☑Tools can pull default settings from any scrapbook entity. For example, the Text tool can 
absorb default settings from lines, and the Line tool can absorb default settings from a 
piece of text within a scrapbook.
☑
☑With the Select tool active, click on a scrapbook in the Scrapbooks Inspector and then 
click in your presentation to place it.
☑
☑Scrapbooks are simply grouped layout entities. Use the Select tool to double-click into a 
scrapbook and modify it once it is inserted into your presentation. This operation is simi-
lar to navigating containers in SketchUp.

Chapter 14
Inserting Content
T
o move a 3D design into a 2D LayOut presentation, you simply insert 
the SketchUp model into LayOut. You can insert all sorts of content, 
including SketchUp models, images, and text, to describe your design. 
Any inserted content can be lightly edited in LayOut, or seamlessly sent 
to a program more suited for editing the specific file, while maintaining 
the dynamic link. In this chapter, you will insert and edit all of LayOut’s 
insertable entities.
Working with SketchUp Models
Hands down, the most important file you’ll insert into LayOut is the SketchUp file (.skp). 
The dynamic link between a SketchUp file and a LayOut presentation allows more than one 
person to work on a project. For example, someone could work on the text while someone 
else works on the presentation. By presenting your 3D model as 2D drawings and diagrams, 
you will be able to accurately and efficiently describe your designs and ideas.
New LayOut Presentation
To begin your new LayOut presentation, follow these steps:
1.	 Open LayOut and start a new presentation. Select the BIC_11x17 Landscape - Linear title 
block that you created in the last chapter, or you can choose any title block you want.

251
2.	 Within the Layers Inspector, unlock and set the current layer to DRAWINGS. Any-
thing that you insert into SketchUp will typically be assigned to this layer.
Inserting the File
To insert the SketchUp file, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select Insert. This launches the Open 
dialog box.
2.	 Navigate to the Class Files folder for this chapter and select the BIC_Denver  
Row House.skp file.
3.	 Click on the Open button at the bottom-right corner of the dialog box. The 
SketchUp model will be inserted into a viewport in your LayOut presentation 
(Figure 14.1).
Figure 14.1  The new viewport created within LayOut
Assigning a Scene
The new viewport will be set to Last Saved View. This is the camera view that was shown 
when your model was last saved. Every time you save your SketchUp model, the Last Saved 

252
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
View will change. It is always best to assign a static view, or scene, to the viewport. To assign 
a scene in the SketchUp Model dialog, follow these steps:
1.	 Using the Select tool, select the viewport.
2.	 In the SketchUp Model Inspector, set the Viewport Scene to LO_Perspective 01 and 
the Rendering setting to Hybrid.
3.	 Using the Select tool, expand the viewport so that it encompasses most of the pre-
sentation area on the page (Figure 14.2).
4.	 If Auto-Render is off, render the models manually by right-clicking on the presenta-
tion background and choosing Render Models on Page.
Figure 14.2  Expand the viewport.
Clipping Mask
A clipping mask lets you control what part of an object you see. This is helpful when you’re 
cropping viewports and images in LayOut. Clipping masks work with images and SketchUp 
model viewports. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Activate the Rectangle tool and encourage inferences from the top-right and 
­bottom-left corners of the title block. Click once to start the rectangle where the 
inference lines converge.
2.	 Move your cursor away from the start point to draw a shape covering the portion of 
the viewport you want to see (Figure 14.3).

253
Chapter 14: Inserting Content
Figure 14.3  Encourage inferences while you draw the clipping mask.
3.	 Using the Select tool, select both the viewport and the clipping mask shape.
4.	 Right-click on the selection and choose Create Clipping Mask (Figure 14.4).
Figure 14.4  Use the clipping mask to cover the part of the object you want to be seen.  
The part that is covered will be the part that is visible when the clipping mask is applied.

254
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
To edit a clipping mask, double-click on the masked viewport/image with the Select tool. 
Use the Select tool to move and scale the clipping mask shape. Sometimes it is easier to just 
right-click on the clipped object, choose Release Clipping Mask, and then edit the shape and 
re-create the clipping mask.
TIP  Use any of the Drawing tools to create a shape for clipping. The final clipping 
mask shape must be one complete shape, not a group or collection of shapes. Use the 
Split and Join tools to finalize a complex clipping mask shape.
Editing the Model
A SketchUp model can be opened directly from LayOut, which will create a seamless link 
between SketchUp and LayOut. To enhance your design and see the results within your 
presentation immediately, follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click on the viewport and choose Edit in SketchUp.
2.	 Make your changes to the SketchUp model.
3.	 Close the model and save it.
4.	 All of the viewports linked to that model will be updated when the file is saved. If 
Auto-Render is off, you will need to render the viewports manually.
Working with Images
Images provide another level of information and complement the style of visual information. 
You can insert all sorts of images, including locator maps from Google Earth or Google 
Maps, project photographs, watermarks, and other diagrams.
Inserting Images
LayOut offers the option to insert images as .jpg or .png files. A .png file contains an alpha or 
transparency layer. This transparency gives you the ability to create watermarks without having 
to create elaborate clipping masks in LayOut. To insert an image, just follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Insert.
2.	 Navigate to the Class Files folder and select the BIC_01 - Site Context.jpg file. Click 
the Open button at the bottom-right corner of the dialog.

255
Chapter 14: Inserting Content
3.	 Using the Select tool, scale and reposition the image on the presentation area as 
shown in Figure 14.5. When scaling, be sure to use a corner grip and hold the Shift 
key to lock the aspect ratio.
Figure 14.5  The context photograph inserted, scaled, and properly positioned in the 
presentation
Editing Images
The Edit Image command allows you to work seamlessly between LayOut and your favorite 
image editor. Use an image editor to touch up photos, and crop, scale, and resize images. Just 
follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click on an image and choose Open with Photoshop, or whatever image editor 
you assigned in Chapter 6, “The Professional’s SketchUp Environment.”
2.	 Modify the image within your image editor.
3.	 Close and save the file.
4.	 The image automatically updates in LayOut. If it does not update immediately, right-
click on the image and choose Update Reference.

256
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Working with Text
Insert text into a presentation to explain the graphics and include details such as schedules, 
notes, and drawing lists.  The dynamic link enables the text to be edited in a word processor, 
which will have additional helpful features such as spellcheck.
Inserting Text
You can insert text as a .txt file or an .rtf file. You can’t save visual text properties (such as 
colors, fonts, and formatting) in a .txt file, which limits its usefulness as an import. An .rtf 
file can store all of the visual properties you apply to text.  Once you have created your text 
in a word processor, you can save the file as an .rtf file and insert into LayOut. Just follow 
these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Insert.
2.	 Navigate to the Class Files folder for this chapter and select the Denver Rowhouse 
Description.rtf file.
3.	 Click on Open.
4.	 Reposition and scale the text as desired. See Figure 14.6.
Figure 14.6  Inserted text and the final presentation

257
Chapter 14: Inserting Content
TIP  You can export spreadsheets to .txt files and then import them into LayOut, 
although your formatting options will be limited in LayOut. Typically, the best solution 
is to build spreadsheet-type graphics in LayOut. See the “Schedules” section in 
Chapter 20, “Construction Documents.”
Editing Text
The text is now part of your presentation, but you can still edit it with your favorite word 
processing program. To edit text outside of LayOut, follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click on the text and choose Edit Text.
2.	 Modify the text in the default text editor.
3.	 Close the file and save your changes. You will see the text update within LayOut.
TIP  When you double-click on text and edit in LayOut, you will break the dynamic 
link between the inserted file and the LayOut text. There is no way to relink edited text 
without reinserting the original file.
Chapter Points
☑
☑Right-click on any linked content to open with the external editor set in Chapter 6 “The 
Professional’s SketchUp Environment.”
☑
☑Editing text within LayOut breaks the dynamic link. Typically, editing the bulk of your 
text in a word processor and then inserting that text into LayOut works best. Once it’s 
inserted, make all of your final text edits in LayOut.
☑
☑You can manage all of your inserted content, or references, within the Document 
Setup c References dialog. From there, you can relink, unlink, and edit in an assigned 
external program.


The Architectural 
Design Process
Relating to The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture, the architectural 
design process has been whittled down into four main phases: Site 
Analysis (SA), Schematic Design (SD), Design Development (DD), 
Construction Documents (CD). In this section you will first learn to 
gather a wealth of 2D and 3D information about the site in a very short 
amount of time, including site plans, site sections,  topography lines, and 
building context. You will then leverage the Google Geo features and the 
tools available in SketchUp Pro and LayOut to expedite measuring and 
drafting as-built drawings. Next, you will respond to the site data and 
P a r t  I V

existing conditions with thoughtful designs represented in  
efficient and organized 3D study models. The study models will 
seamlessly evolve into a detailed proposed conditions model optimized 
for any type of presentation, animation, or photorealistic rendering. 
Ultimately, the organization methods you learn in this section will allow 
you to share .dwg backgrounds with consultants, move to other CAD 
programs, and easily create construction documents using LayOut. 
You will soon realize how the entire architectural design process 
can be expedited, and how your designs can be more intelligent, by 
implementing The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture.

Site Analysis: Digital 
Site Survey
T
he first step of responsible design is to understand not only the 
client’s needs, but also the constraints and potential of the building 
site. Site analysis involves obtaining geographical information, maps, 
aerial photos, topographic data, building context information, as-built 
drawings, preliminary code information, and anything you’ll need to make 
informed design decisions. This preliminary information will enable you to 
make realistic decisions about what can actually be built.
Obtaining all of this data can be a huge task. SketchUp Pro allows you to grab preliminary 
3D data, everything you need to get started sketching, estimating, and designing while you 
wait for the hard data to show up. In this section, you will learn techniques to gather accu-
rate 2D and 3D site data in a short amount of time. This data will allow you, as a designer, to 
make informed decisions, saving time and headaches later when real data arrives.
A digital site survey is the process used to create a 2D site plan, 2D/3D contour map, and 
site sections from Google 3D data without leaving your desk. By converting 3D data into 2D 
drawings, or sketch backgrounds, you can get started on a project immediately and make 
informed design decisions. The ability to generate a two-dimensional site plan of just about 
any building or site allows you to immediately assess project scope and make more accurate 

262
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
estimates of time and work. This process can fit into any designer’s workflow and style, 
whether it is sketching by hand or diving right into 3D modeling. The techniques illustrated 
in this section allow you to gather a wealth of 2D and 3D information digitally without ever 
visiting the site (Figure 15.1).
Figure 15.1  2D/3D Site Plans and Sections are the product of a 
digital site survey.

The first step of a digital site survey is to geo-locate the site in SketchUp. Geo-location is the 
process of identifying a precise real-world geographic location and assigning it to a SketchUp 
model. During the geo-location process you will import 2D aerial imagery, 3D terrain, 
precise latitude and longitude coordinates, and the exact Solar North direction. With this 
data attached to your model, you will be able to make informed decisions about existing 
conditions, topography, and sun angles.
By accurately geo-locating a model, you also open the door to a multitude of possibili-
ties for integrating with other data-rich Google “geo” services. This connection to Google is 
one of the unique features that sets SketchUp apart from other 3D software packages. As 
you will see, SketchUp is seamlessly integrated with popular Google products such as Maps, 
Street View, Earth, and Building Maker. These additional Google products allow you to easily 
pick a location, generate context building models, find optimized building facade textures, 
and view your designs in a real-world context.
Adding a Location
For this exercise, you should have the Google toolbar open. Click on the View drop-down 
menu and choose Toolbars c Google. To geo-locate a model using the Add Location feature, 
follow the steps discussed here (Figure 15.2).
1.	 Start a new SketchUp model by either opening 
SketchUp, or by clicking on the File drop-down 
menu and choosing New.
2.	 Click the Add Location button on the Google 
toolbar (Figure 15.3). This automatically launches 
a Google Maps interface where you can search for 
and find any location on planet Earth.
Figure 15.2  The Google toolbar

264
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 15.3  The Add Location window
3.	 The search bar at the top of the Add Location window will accept an address, zip 
code, intersection, city name, or popular landmark. For this example, enter 507 Sum-
mit Pl, Winter Park, Co. Click the Search button (or press Enter) to start the search; 
the map will zoom into the specified location.
TIP  Navigate the Add Location window the same as you would Google Maps. Click 
and drag to pan the map up, down, and side to side. Double-click on the map to zoom 
in. Double-right-click on the map to zoom out. You can also use the Screen Navigation 
tools in the top-left corner of the map.
4.	 Zoom out two to three clicks so you can see more of the site as shown in Figure 15.4.
Figure 15.4  Extents of the example site

265
Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey
5.	 Click the Select Region button at the top-right corner of the Add Location window. 
This adds a selection rectangle to the map with pins on the four corners.
6.	 Select the site by repositioning the pins as shown in Figure 15.5. Typically, you will 
select the desired site plus any surrounding context that will be visible and potentially 
influence your design. Not to worry, you can easily add more terrain if you decide 
that you want more of the site in the future.
7.	 Once the selection rectangle 
surrounds the desired site, 
click the Grab button at the 
top-right corner of the Add 
Location window. This closes 
the Add Location window 
and returns your active screen 
to SketchUp. Now there is a 
full-scale aerial snapshot of the 
selected site in your SketchUp 
model.
8.	 In addition to the flat aerial 
imagery, you have also 
imported the 3D terrain of 
the site (Figure 15.6). Click 
the Toggle Terrain button on 
the Google toolbar to toggle 
between the flat aerial imagery 
and the 3D terrain. The 2D aer-
ial imagery and 3D terrain are 
simply locked groups of geom-
etry that are automatically 
added to the Google Earth 
Snapshot layer and the Google 
Earth Terrain layer. The Toggle 
Terrain button simply switches 
these layers on and off.

the Add Location window.

Verifying Model Location
The Add Location feature attached a precise Earth location to your SketchUp model. You 
can verify the actual location by clicking on the Window drop-down menu and choosing 
Model Info, then click on the Geo-location tab (Figure 15.7). This tab displays the latitude 
and longitude, and it allows you to clear the location, add more imagery, and set the 
location manually (which is rarely necessary).
Figure 15.7  Model Info a Geo-location
Verifying Solar North
By adding a precise location to your model, you also added an accurate Solar North 
direction. Solar North establishes the path of the sun relative to your SketchUp model to 
create extremely accurate shadows. To access the Solar North tools, click on the View drop-
down menu and choose Toolbars c Solar North (Figure 15.8). The first button on the Solar 
North toolbar toggles the North arrow on and off. The green axis is north by default, and 
Solar North is often very closely aligned with the green axis.
It is possible to change the Solar North direction of a 
model, but doing so is not recommended. The remain-
ing two buttons on the Solar North toolbar, Set North 
tool and Enter North Angle tool, allow you to modify 
the Solar North direction with precision. If you do 
Figure 15.8  The Solar North toolbar

267
Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey
change the Solar North direction, the shadows will no longer be real. For best results, leave 
Solar North alone after you add a location to a SketchUp model.
Site Plan
After you add a location to your SketchUp model, generating a detailed site plan is 
simple. Use the SketchUp Drawing tools to trace the flat 2D aerial imagery and create 
vector linework that can be set to an architectural scale in LayOut or can be exported to 
other drafting programs. This makes a great starting point for any designer who wants to 
understand site constraints and the general scope of a project.
2D Plan
There are endless ways to approach the task of tracing a site. Once you are comfortable in 
SketchUp, you will find a few favorite tools that you will tend to lean on.
Trace Roads
Use the Drawing tools to trace the 2D aerial imagery and create a 2D site plan. Here are a 
few tips for tracing:
☑
☑Confirm that the Toggle Terrain button is off so that only the 2D aerial imagery is showing.
☑
☑Set the length snapping to a round dimension, such as 1f or 1g to keep your dimensions 
clean. In the Model Info dialog’s Units tab, check the Enable Length Snapping check box 
and enter the desired tolerance.
☑
☑Use the Materials browser’s Edit tab to desaturate and lighten the aerial imagery. This 
will make the lines stand out against the imagery and make it easier to see what you are 
working on.
☑
☑After tracing the road, close off the ends to create a surface. Then make them a group.
☑
☑Draw one side of the road, and then use the Offset tool to create the other side.
☑
☑Advanced tools, such as the bezier.rb script, will help you accurately trace curved roads.
☑
☑It is okay to be loose and sketchy when you’re tracing insignificant details.
☑
☑Use the Axes tool to align the axes with the buildings that you are tracing. Remember, it 
is a three-click process. First, click to set the  origin; second, click to set the red axis; third, 
click to set the blue axis.

268
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
☑
☑Use the Rectangle tool instead of the Line tool to trace buildings. The Rectangle tool 
draws all lines on axis and generates significantly more geometry per click. Quickly clean 
up extra geometry by clicking and dragging over extra lines with the Eraser tool.
☑
☑Trace the house footprints and extrude them into 3D. Make each house a group (Figure 15.9).
Figure 15.9  The final traced plan floating above the terrain
Converting to 3D Roads
Now that you have created a 2D site plan, drape it onto the 3D terrain to create the 3D roads. 
This step uses, but does not require, the Instant Road plugin from www.valiarchitects.com. 
If you use this script, the roads will have accurate topography lines. If you don’t use it, they 
won’t. They aren’t critical, but accurate topography lines make more realistic graphics, and 
using Instant Road is easy!
1.	 Toggle the 3D Terrain on.
2.	 Right-click on the terrain and choose Unlock.
3.	 Right-click on the terrain again and choose “Explode.”
4.	 Using the Select tool, select the terrain mesh and the grouped 2D roads (Figure 15.10).

269
Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey
Figure 15.10  Select the Terrain and Road group for the 
Instant Road plugin.
5.	 Click on the Plugin drop-down menu and choose Instant Road c Create Road from 
Face(s). Assign the appropriate settings. The free version limits the road shoulder to 
3f. If you’re using the Pro version, set the Shoulder Width to 10f, set Make Curb to No, 
and set Edit Additional Properties to yes. Click OK to run the operation (Figure 15.11).
Figure 15.11  Instant Road plugin settings
6.	 Select the new roads and the extra group of lines, then right-click on the selection 
and choose “Explode.”

270
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
7.	 Activate the Paint Bucket tool. Hold down the Alt key (Command on Mac) and click 
on the terrain to sample the GE Snapshot material.
8.	 While holding down the Ctrl key (Option on Mac), click on the new road to apply 
the GE Snapshot material with the “clicked on” material to all of the connected faces 
(Figure 15.12).
Figure 15.12  Apply the GE Snapshot material to the new 
roads and shoulder.
9.	 Using the Select tool, triple-click on the terrain; assign Layer0 to all of the terrain 
edges and surfaces.
10.	Right-click on the selection and choose Make Group.
11.	 Assign the Google Earth Terrain layer to the new 3D Terrain group.
12.	Right-click on the new group and choose Lock to lock the group.
TIP  Instead of performing step 5, you could use the Drape tool to simply drape the 
2D roads onto the 3D site. However, this won’t set the contour lines to accurately 
represent the roads later.
Always save before you perform any sandbox or instant road operations. You should 
do this not because the Sandbox tools are buggy, but because if you click on the 
wrong object, you could find yourself waiting a long time. The Sandbox tools have the 
potential to process and/or generate a huge amount of geometry with one click.

Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey
3D Topographic Survey
Imagine getting your paws on a complete topographic survey of a proposed site within five 
minutes of receiving a new project, without leaving your desk—and for free! Although a full 
survey can take weeks to schedule and days to complete, with SketchUp you can generate a 
schematic topographic survey based on the 3D terrain data from Google Earth.
How accurate is the imported terrain data? Old terrain is 90-meter resolution, better ter-
rain is 30-meter resolution, and excellent terrain is 10-meter resolution. All 3D terrain can 
be used for preliminary schematic design, but it’s not a replacement for a survey. In other 
words, don’t build off of the imported terrain data! The Grand Canyon at 10-meter resolu-
tion is spectacular, as you can see in Figure 15.13.
Figure 15.13  The Grand Canyon at 10-meter resolution (top); a 
field in Kansas at 90-meter resolution (bottom)
Slicing the Terrain
A topographic survey represents the earth sliced horizontally at regular intervals. Google 
provides the 3D terrain so you just need to slice it. Use simple rectangles and the Intersect 
menu to create topography lines, as discussed here:
1.	 Use the Toggle Terrain button on the Google toolbar to turn on the 3D terrain.

272
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Using the Eraser tool, hold down the Shift key and click and drag over the houses to 
hide them if you have created them.
3.	 Draw a rectangle that is larger than the site. Double-click the rectangle using the 
Select tool to select the surface as well as the bounding edges. Right-click on the 
selection and choose Make Group (Figure 15.14).
Figure 15.14  Draw the large rectangle.
4.	 Move the rectangle down on the blue axis until it is obviously underneath the site 
geometry (Figure 15.15).
Figure 15.15  The rectangle is just below the terrain; shad-
ows are turned on for effect.

273
Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey
5.	 Copy the rectangle up along the blue axis 5f (or whatever interval you want your 
topographic map to read; for example, 1f, 10f, 25f). Immediately after you make a 
copy, type 150x, then press Enter, to make 150 additional copies of the original rect-
angle, each at the same interval. The goal is to make sure that the entire 3D terrain is 
covered with the rectangle slices (Figure 15.16).
Figure 15.16  Rectangles slices are copied up on the blue 
axis at 5f intervals to completely cover the terrain; X-ray 
mode is turned on for effect.
6.	 Select all of the rectangle slices and terrain. Right-click on the selection and choose 
Intersect Faces c With Selection (Figure 15.17). This draws all of the slices the rect-
angles make when they penetrate the 3D terrain, thereby creating topography lines.
7.	 Delete all of the rectangle slices. You no longer need them after the topography lines 
are created (Figure 15.18).
Figure 15.17  Selected rectangles
Figure 15.18  The topography lines are isolated; 
the Hide Rest of Model option is on for effect.

274
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
8.	 Click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Select All. Right-click on the selection 
and choose Make Group. Because the 3D terrain is locked, only the topography lines 
will be included in the group.
TIP  At this point, you could export the model to a 3D .dwg file so you can use it in 
your favorite CAD program. Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Export c 3D 
Model. Set the export type to .dwg and save to the appropriate folder.
Site Plan Scenes
You have created all of the geometry you need for the site plan and section. Now you need 
to create scenes to display the geometry in a meaningful way in LayOut. It is best to first 
create all of the geometry and scenes in SketchUp, and then move them to LayOut to create 
a presentation.
To create the scene representing the topographic lines, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Camera drop-down menu and choose Standard Views c Top.
2.	 Click on the Camera drop-down menu and check on Parallel Projection.
3.	 Click on the Camera drop-down menu and choose Zoom Extents.
4.	 Open the Layers dialog box by clicking on the Window drop-down menu and choos-
ing Layers. Turn off both the Google Earth Terrain and Google Earth Snapshot layers. 
The site topography lines will remain.
5.	 Verify that the context houses are hidden.
6.	 Open the Scenes dialog by clicking on the Window drop-down menu and choosing Scenes. 
Click on the Add Scene button (+) in the top-left corner of the Scene dialog. Rename the 
scene LO_5f TOPOGRAPHY. Place checks beside all of the properties to save.
7.	 Slide the new scene to the end of the line by clicking on the Move Scene Down but-
ton near the top-right corner of the Scenes dialog (Figure 15.19).
TIP  Before starting the next scene, click on the LO_5f TOPOGRAPHY scene and be 
careful not to move the camera. To properly align in LayOut, two scenes need to have 
the same camera view.
To create the scene that represents the site plan, follow these steps:
1.	 Click the Add Scene button (+) in the top-left corner of the Scene dialog. Rename the 
scene LO_SITE PLAN. Place checks beside all of the Properties to Save.

275
Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey

2.	 Click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Unhide All. You should be able to see 
the context houses again.
3.	 Hide the topography lines by holding down the Shift key and scrubbing over them 
with the Eraser tool. The entire group will be hidden with one swipe.
4.	 Toggle on the 3D terrain by using the Toggle Terrain button on the Google toolbar.
5.	 Turn on the shadows (Figure 15.20).
6.	 Right-click on the LO_SITE PLAN scene tab at the top of the screen and choose 
Update (Figure 15.21).

Site Section
Site sections clearly describe level changes throughout a site. Using the Section tool in SketchUp 
to cut through the 3D site topography will allow you to generate unlimited site sections.
Section Plane
Use a section plane to slice the site and clearly describe the elevation changes present at the 
site. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Orbit into a 3D view and zoom out to take in the entire 3D terrain on one screen.
2.	 Activate the Section Plane tool from the Google toolbar. Find the proper orientation 
for the section plane, hold Shift to lock the orientation, and then click to place the 
section plane (Figure 15.22).
3.	 Use the Move tool to adjust the location of the section plane as shown in Figure 15.23.
Figure 15.22  Find the proper section plane orientation on an axis before you place the plane. 
Hovering on the invisible plane present at each axis will help you find the correct orientation

Chapter 15: Site Analysis: Digital Site Survey
Site Section Scene
Now that you have added a section through the site, you will need to add a scene to create 
the Site Section drawing in LayOut. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the 2D DRAWING utility scene tab at the top of your screen.
2.	 To open the Scenes dialog, click on the Window drop-down menu and choose 
Scenes.
3.	 Click on the plus sign (+) to add a scene. Check on all of the properties to save. Name 
the scene LO_SITE SECTION.
4.	 Right-click on the section plane and select Align View to set the camera angle per-
pendicular to the section plane.
5.	 Click on the Camera drop-down menu and verify that the camera is set to Parallel 
Projection.
6.	 Click on Zoom Extents to maximize the geometry on your screen.
7.	 Right-click on the LO_SITE SECTION scene tab at the top of the screen and choose 
Update.
8.	 Click the Move Page button to slide the new scene to the end of the line 
(Figure 15.24).
Figure 15.24  The final site section scene

278
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
At this point, you must save your model to the appropriate project folder or TEMP folder. 
You will need the saved file to create the final LayOut presentation. Name this file BIC_Win-
ter Park Site.skp.
Final Drawings
Now that you have created all of the scenes you need for the digital site survey, you are 
ready to present them in LayOut. In this section, you will arrange the scenes and use 
advanced LayOut operations to create background drawings you can use for your sketches 
during the design process. After some practice, you should be able to generate this type of 
digital-site survey graphic in just a few minutes. These graphics are also great to use when 
you are sitting down with a client to discuss a new project.
Site Plan
Create a site plan to think through site logistics and explain site improvements. Just follow 
these steps:
1.	 Open LayOut. Select the BIC_8.5 x 11_Landscape template (Figure 15.25).
Figure 15.25  The Getting Started window
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Document Setup c Paper. Adjust the 
paper settings to tabloid size with a portrait orientation (Figure 15.26).

Figure 15.26  Adjust the paper size and orientation.
3.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Insert. 
Navigate to the folder containing the BIC_Winter 
Park Site.skp file, select the file, and choose Open.
4.	 The BIC_Winter Park Site.skp file in the new view-
port will be set to Last Saved View. With the viewport 
selected, assign the SITE PLAN scene in the SketchUp 
Model Inspector. Set the viewport to render as Hybrid 
so both the raster imagery and the vector linework will 
show. Set the viewport scale to 1g = 50f (Figure 15.27).
5.	 Use the Select tool to resize and move the viewport to 
fit the page as shown in Figure 15.28.
6.	 On the Style tab of the SketchUp Model Inspector, set 
the line weight to 2. If Auto-Render is unchecked, you 
should render the models on the page at this time  
(Figure 15.29).
7.	 With the viewport selected, click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Duplicate. 
This will make a copy of the viewport exactly 1g down and 1g to the right.
8.	 In the SketchUp Model Inspector, on the View tab, assign the LO_5f TOPOGRAPHY 
scene to the viewport. Set the viewport to render as Vector (Figure 15.30).
Figure 15.27  The SketchUp Model 
settings indicate the scene, scale, 
and render settings.

9.	 While holding down the Shift key, tap the Left arrow key four times and then tap the 
Up arrow four times. When the Shift key is held down, each nudge is 1/4g.
10.	Click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Explode. The contents of the view-
port become LayOut geometry and are no longer linked to the SketchUp model.
11.	 In the Shape Style Inspector, set the line weight to 2, the dash pattern to dots, and 
the dashes scale to .25 (Figure 15.31).
12.	Right-click on the LO_SITE PLAN viewport and choose Explode. The raster contents 
of the viewport are now represented as an image in LayOut, and the vector con-
tents of the viewport are now represented as LayOut geometry.

a .pdf file you can print or email. Navigate to an 
appropriate project folder, or your TEMP folder, 
and select Save (Figure 15.42).
Uncheck Create PDF Layers from LayOut Layers. 
Typically, you won’t need to have these layers avail-
able in the .pdf, and they can sometimes cause 
problems at the print shop.
Set the Output Quality to High. Final output  
should always be at the highest resolution and  
quality possible (Figure 15.43).
Chapter Points
☑
☑You can explode viewports in LayOut for exist-
ing conditions because the existing conditions 
do not change.
☑
☑Many of the operations completed in this 
chapter can be accessed from several differ-
ent places; an Inspector, a keyboard shortcut, a 
custom toolbar, a right-click menu, or from the 
drop-down menus at the top of the screen. Use 
whichever method feels best to you.
☑
☑You should export LayOut presentations to a 
.pdf file and print from there because a .pdf 
file gives you the most printing options. Avoid 
using the Print command in LayOut.
☑
☑After you practice making the digital site survey 
exercise five times, you should be able to do 
the whole thing in less than fifteen minutes.
☑
☑You can unlock and modify the terrain, but don’t move it. If you move the terrain, the 
geo-location settings and shadows will no longer be accurate.

Site Analysis: 
Building Context
T
he built environment surrounding your site can influence design, 
provide interesting reactions, or be totally insignificant and better 
off ignored. Regardless of how you view the surrounding environment, 
you should always consider building context when you are making a 
site analysis. With a geo-located model, you can find and generate the 
buildings surrounding a site in several ways, regardless of how little or 
how much information you have to start.
The Project Site
Imagine for a moment that you have been asked to design a structure on a lot near the very 
visible Golden Triangle Museum District in Denver. As a responsible designer, you want to 
address the context, but how do you address the critically famous and complex context at 
this site, which includes Michael Grave’s Geometric Central Library; the brand-new, sleek, 
minimalist Clyfford Still Museum; and Daniel Libeskind’s abstract extension to the art 
museum? How in the world would you even build something like the art museum extension 

287
in SketchUp? In this chapter, you will collect and build the context near the Golden Triangle 
Museum District in Denver (Figure 16.1).
Figure 16.1  The proposed context zone and building site
To define the site, follow these steps:
1.	 Start a new model by opening SketchUp, or click on the File drop-down menu and 
select New.
2.	 Click the Add Location button on the Google toolbar to geo-locate the model.
3.	 Enter Denver Art Museum in the search bar and zoom out several clicks to locate 
the site, as shown in Figure 16.1.
4.	 Click the Select Region button.
5.	 Position the pins around the four city blocks that compose the site, as shown in 
Figure 16.2.

288
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture

Finding Nearby Buildings
Instead of spending hours trying to measure and build your own context models, find 
someone else’s. Geo-located models uploaded to 3D Warehouse, as well as some buildings 
from Google Earth, are searchable and available for download through the Components 
browser. Once a location is attached to your model, you will be able to find other buildings 
that are close to your site in the Nearby Buildings collection. To do that, follow these steps:
1.	 To open the Components browser, click on 
the Window drop-down menu and choose 
Components.
2.	 In the Components browser, click on the Col-
lections drop-down menu and choose Nearby 
Buildings (Figure 16.4). Remember, this collec-
tion is available only after a model has been 
geo-located.
3.	 Click on the thumbnail icon to immediately 
download a model directly into the current 
SketchUp model. Find and import the models 
indicated with red dots in Figure 16.5.
4.	 Double-click on each of the context building 
models, click on the Edit drop-down menu, and 
choose Unhide c All. The lines you need to cre-
ate a complete building-elevation line drawing 
will appear.
5.	 Unlock and delete the 3D terrain and aerial 
imagery in all of the imported context models. 
The most current and accurate terrain is already 
imported into your model (Figure 16.6).
TIP  The Nearby Buildings collection is very helpful 
for working with heavily populated areas. Useful 
models are readily available for most downtown 
areas, while models for the suburbs are typically not.
Figure 16.4  The Nearby Models 
collection is available in the Col-
lections drop-down menu.

Geo-Modeling
If you don’t find everything you need in the Nearby Models collection, you can always build 
models yourself.
Match Photo is a SketchUp feature that allows you to reverse engineer the perspective 
of a photograph to trace a 2D image and ultimately produce a 3D model. You may have 
completed a studio project in college where you enlarged a photograph on a copy machine, 
taped it to your desk, and then used a T-square to project the vanishing points onto your 
neighbor’s desk. Then, you used those points to trace the rest of the photograph and gener-
ate new designs with the same perspective. SketchUp allows you to do the same thing in a 
much more efficient digital interface.
The photograph is taped to your digital desk in SketchUp as an image file import. The 
T-square to trace the photograph and project the vanishing points is replaced with the axes 
bars in the Match Photo interface. Your pencil is replaced with SketchUp’s Drawing and 
Modification tools.
Once Match Photo is set up, the process can be as easy as tracing a 2D photograph with 
the Drawing tools to create a 3D model. In the following exercise, you will leverage Match 
Photo by combining a properly scaled building footprint imported from Google Earth with a 
perspective photograph to create an accurate and detailed 3D SketchUp model.
Photographing a Building
When you’re taking photographs to use in Match Photo, keep the following tips in mind:
☑
☑Do not use any special lenses on your camera. A typical, inexpensive camera or even a 
phone camera will work just fine.

291
Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
☑
☑Walk around the entire site and photograph the entire building from every angle 
possible.
☑
☑Photograph the building’s details up close—for example, signs, materials, entries, win-
dows, and doors.
☑
☑Too many pictures are better than too few. When you’re working at 2:00 a.m., you don’t 
want to need more than you shot.
☑
☑Do not crop or resize the images before you import them into SketchUp.
Creating a Mass Model
To create a building mass model, follow these steps:
1.	 For now, hide the four context models and the proposed building mass. To do this, 
select all of them, right-click on the selection, and choose Hide.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select the Geo-Location menu. Uncheck the 
Show Terrain option so that only the flat 2D aerial imagery is showing.

292
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
3.	 Activate the Rectangle tool and click once on the top-left corner of the building 
footprint.
4.	 Move your cursor away from the 
start point and click again on the 
bottom-right corner of the building 
footprint to finish the rectangle (Fig-
ure 16.7). There is no need for pre-
cise dimensions on this geo-model.
5.	 Use the Push/Pull tool to extrude 
the rectangle up to an exaggerated 
height as shown in Figure 16.8.
6.	 Set the origin at an appropriate 
starting point for sketching. For this 
model, and most others, set the 
axes at the front-bottom corner of 
the model when viewing the model from a vantage point similar to the Match Photo 
photograph.
7.	 Within SketchUp, position yourself in a view similar to the photograph you are using 
for Match Photo (Figure 16.9).
Figure 16.7  Use the Rectangle tool to trace the 
building footprint.
Figure 16.9  Set the origin at the front-bottom cor-
ner of the building based on the photograph you 
are using for Match Photo.

Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
Using Match New Photo
To use the Match Photo interface, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Camera drop-down menu and choose Match New Photo.
2.	 Navigate to your Project Files folder and select the Match Photo image BIC_01 - 
Clyfford Still Museum.jpg. Click on Open to return to SketchUp; an admittedly 
intimidating grid will appear over the photograph. Take a moment to study the image 
in Figure 16.10.
Figure 16.10  The Match Photo interface
3.	 Navigate the Match Photo interface using familiar mouse navigation techniques. Push 
down and hold the scroll-wheel button to pan the screen up, down, left, and right. 
Roll the scroll-wheel toward the screen to zoom in, and away from the screen to 
zoom out. Click outside of the Match Photo photograph to exit Match Photo mode.
TIP  To get back to Match Photo mode, right-click on the automatically created Match 
Photo Scene tab and choose Edit Matched Photo.
4.	 In the Match Photo dialog box, uncheck the Model check box to turn off the model 
and clarify the Match Photo screen, which will make working with the Match Photo 
interface much easier.

294
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
5.	 Align the axis bars with parallel ele-
ments on the building, such as window 
headers and mullions, ledges, and roof 
lines. The green axis bars should be 
aligned with parallel elements on the 
west side of the building, and the red 
axis bars should be aligned with paral-
lel elements on the south side of the 
building (Figure 16.11).
TIP  Avoid using the ground plane as a 
parallel element because it will never be 
perfectly parallel with the building.
6.	 Position the Match Photo origin at an 
appropriate starting point for sketching 
(Figure 16.12). This will be at the same 
front-bottom corner you positioned the 
axes at in the beginning of the exercise.
7.	 In the Match Photo dialog, turn on the 
model.
8.	 Zoom the Match Photo photograph to 
match the model by clicking and drag-
ging on an axis until the vertical walls 
of the SketchUp model match the walls 
of the Match Photo photograph (Fig-
ure 16.13). The footprint is correct now; 
that is why you align the vertical walls. 
The building height is not yet correct 
and should be ignored for now because 
it was drawn at an exaggerated height.
9.	 In the Match Photo dialog, click the 
Done button.
Figure 16.11  Manipulate the Match Photo axis bars 
and origin.

295
Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
Setting Building Height
To accurately set the height of the building, follow these steps:
1.	 Orbit to a bird’s eye view. Activate the Push/Pull tool and click once on the top of the 
building (Figure 16.14).
2.	 Click on the Match 
Photo Scene tab to get 
back to Match Photo 
mode.
3.	 Move your cursor down 
until the top of the 3D 
building mass is aligned 
with the top of the 
building in the pho-
tograph (Figure 16.15). 
Click to finish the Push/
Pull command.
4.	 Take a moment to orbit around and inspect the 3D mass model.
The building width and height are now accurately set. You know this because the build-
ing length and width are derived from the building footprint imported from Google Earth. 
The height of the building is accurately determined by reverse engineering a perspective 
photograph and aligning it with the known building footprint.
Figure 16.15  Align the top of the model with the top of the 
building in the photograph.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Adding 3D Detail
To add detail to your model, follow these steps:
1.	 Once again, click on the Match Photo scene tab at the top of your screen.
2.	 In the Match Photo dialog, click on Project Textures to apply the Match Photo pho-
tograph to the 3D surfaces. This is what makes a geo-model so “light.” The detail is 
held in a photograph rather than represented by 3D geometry.
3.	 Orbit to a 3D view, and then trace over the applied texture images using the 
SketchUp Drawing tools to create the major breaks in the facades.
4.	 Use the Modification tools to turn those breaks in the surfaces into further devel-
oped 3D details. Go back to the 
Match Photo scene to use the photo-
graph as a guide for modeling. Draw 
from other photographs and your 
own experience when modeling.
5.	 Using the Paint Bucket tool, hold the 
Alt key (Command on Mac) to sam-
ple the Google Earth Snapshot, then 
apply the Google Earth Snapshot to 
the roof (Figure 16.16).
TIP  You can gather additional texture images by using Google Street View in 
SketchUp. The imagery pulled from Street View is not nearly as high-resolution as 
an imported image or Match Photo, but it is often all you need to generate detail on 
a context building that you can’t photograph in person. Right-click on a surface and 
choose Add Photo Texture to launch the Street View imagery dialog.
Importing 2D Detail
Match Photo is best used to create the broad strokes of a model, or the massing in general. 
Once a building mass is complete, you can use imported images to add high-resolution 
texture images where they are needed. Use the import image as material technique to replace 
low-resolution match photo materials with your high-resolution close-up photographs.
1.	 Zoom in on the entry of the building (Figure 16.17).
Figure 16.16  Context model with added detail

297
Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
Figure 16.17  Zoom into the entry of the building for a 
strategic view.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Import.
3.	 Verify that the Files of Type drop-down menu is set to All Supported Image Types , 
and the “Use as Texture” radio button is on. Navigate to the class files folder for this 
chapter and select BIC_02 - Clyfford Still Museum Entry.jpg. Click the Open 
button.
4.	 Click once directly on the surface to place the image (Figure 16.18).
Figure 16.18  Click directly on the surface. Avoid using 
edges and points when you initially place an image as a 
texture.
5.	 Move your cursor away from the start point to loosely scale the image; click again to 
finish the import. The image will repeat, or tile, across the surface.

298
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Tweaking a Texture
You can use the Texture Tweaker pins to fine-tune your texture images. Just follow these 
steps:
1.	 Right-click on the surface with the new image, and select Texture c Position to mod-
ify the imported texture image.
2.	 Each of the Texture Tweaker fixed pins has a specific job for modifying the texture 
image. Click once on a pin to pick it up, and click again to put it down. Reposition 
the four pins on the four corners of the entry wall in the photograph shown in Figure 
16.19.
3.	 Click and drag the red pin to the bottom-left corner of the entry wall in the model. 
This will move the entire texture image (Figure 16.20).
4.	 Click and drag the green pin to the bottom-right corner of the entry wall in the 
model. This will properly scale and rotate the image to align with the model (Figure 
16.20).
5.	 Click and drag the blue pin to the top left corner of the entry wall in the model. This 
will properly scale and shear the image to further align with the model (Figure 16.20).
6.	 Click and drag the yellow pin to the top-right corner of the entry wall in the 
model. This will properly distort the image so that it fits the entry wall perfectly 
(Figure 16.20).
7.	 Press the Enter key to finish the Texture Tweak and apply the changes (Figure 16.21).
Figure 16.19  Click on the pins to reposition them as 
shown.
Figure 16.20  Click and drag the pins as shown to 
tweak the texture image.

299
Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
Figure 16.21  The final, tweaked texture image is clearer 
than the original Match Photo image.
TIP  Another way to remove unwanted objects from a texture image is to use an external 
image editor. Right-click on a surface with a texture applied to it and select Texture c Edit 
Texture Image. This will open the texture image in the assigned image editor.
Making Unique Materials
The Make Unique Material feature allows you to find a good chunk of one material and make 
another unique material from that. You can apply the new, optimized material to the rest of 
the model, eliminating trees, shadows, and low-resolution texture images (Figure 16.22).
Figure16.22  Use the Make Unique Material function to 
clean up unwanted objects in the texture image.

300
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
1.	 Draw a rectangle around a piece of the 
scored concrete that is free of trees, 
shadows, and objects. A projected tex-
ture image’s quality will be best toward 
the foreground of the Match Photo 
image (Figure 16.23).
2.	 Right-click in the rectangle and select 
Make Unique Texture. This will create a 
new material cropped to the extents of 
the rectangle.
3.	 Activate the Paint Bucket tool. Hold 
down the Alt key (Command on Mac) 
and click on the new unique mate-
rial to sample it, making it the current 
material.
4.	 To apply the new, optimized material, 
click on surfaces that have a lower-reso-
lution texture image (Figure 16.24).
Another benefit to making a material 
unique is that you eliminate pieces of images 
that are not being used, resulting in smaller 
file sizes.
1.	 Right-click on the front-entry wall-
texture image and select Make Unique 
Material. You won’t see a difference 
in your model, but everything in the 
image that is not shown on the surface 
will be deleted.
TIP  View your designs in the context of the real world in Google Earth. Google Earth 
lets you view all context in the entire city as well as 3D terrain that extends as far as the 
eye can see. Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Preview in Google Earth.
Continue to use the import texture image and make unique texture strategies to further 
develop and add detail to the Clyfford Still Museum context model.

Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
Creating Scenes
Now that the proposed building and context are in a model, you can closely study the 
interaction between a proposed design and existing site conditions.  One way to do this 
is through a shadow study. Create scenes to illustrate the effects of shadows on your 
neighbors. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Orbit to a 3D perspective view, click on the Edit drop-down menu, and choose 
Unhide c All.
2.	 To switch to a line-drawing style and turn on the shadows, click on the 2D  
DRAWING Scene tab at the top of your SketchUp template.
3.	 Adjust the shadow settings time to 9:00 a.m.
4.	 In the Scenes browser, click on the plus sign (+) to add a scene.
5.	 Rename the scene LO_
Shadow Study - 900AM 
and check on all of the Prop-
erties to Save . Move the 
scene to the bottom of the 
list using the “Move Scene 
Down” button in the Scenes 
dialog (Figure 16.25).
6.	 Repeat steps 3 through 5 
for the following scenes: 
1100AM, 100PM, 300PM, 
500PM, and 700PM. Adjust 
the shadow time to the 
respective scene name.
7.	 Save the model to your 
TEMP folder or a logical 
project folder. Name the file  
BIC_Golden Triangle 
Museum District.skp.

302
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  Purge your models to completely remove unused entities. Click on the Window 
drop-down menu and choose Model Info. In the Statistics tab, click on Purge Unused 
to remove all unused layers, materials, styles, and components. Purging before saving 
often drastically reduces the size of the file.
Now that you have the context models, you might want to send them over to your 
favorite 2D or 3D CAD program. To do that, follow these steps: 
1.	 Right-click on the surface of an elevation and select Align View.
2.	 Click on the View drop-down menu and choose Zoom Extents.
3.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select Export c 2D Graphic.
4.	 Set the Export Type to .dwg/.dxf and click the Export Options button to select a 
.dwg format.
5.	 Click the Export button to finish.
LayOut Diagrams
To create and annotate a shadow study, send the SketchUp model to LayOut. Just follow 
these steps:
1.	 Within SketchUp, click on the File drop-down menu and choose Send to LayOut.
2.	 Within LayOut, select the BIC_8.5x11 – Landscape template (or your favorite tem-
plate or title block).
3.	 Move and scale the viewport so that it takes up the top-left one-sixth of the page.
4.	 Select the viewport; in the SketchUp Model Inspector, assign the LO_Shadow Study - 
900AM scene.
5.	 Shadows must render as rasters, and lines look best when rendered as vectors. There-
fore, set the viewport to render as Hybrid.
6.	 While holding down the Ctrl key, click and drag on the viewport to make a copy.
7.	 In the SketchUp Model Inspector, change the scene to LO_Shadow Study - 1100AM.
8.	 Repeat steps 6 and 7 for each additional shadow study scene.
9.	 Below each image, add text that indicates the time of day (Figure 16.26).

303
Chapter 16: Site Analysis: Building Context
Figure 16.26  The final shadow study presentation in LayOut
TIP  It is possible to modify a viewport’s style and shadow settings in the SketchUp 
Model Inspector, although it is almost always better to assign these properties to a 
scene in SketchUp and then assign each scene to a viewport in LayOut.

Chapter 17
Site Analysis: 
Documenting an 
Existing Building
C
reating accurate as-built drawings is a critical early step in the 
design process. When you’re making decisions about new 
construction, it is important to be well informed about existing conditions. 
The techniques in this section will give you an organized plan of attack 
for measuring and documenting any building.
The Project
For this exercise, you will prepare for a site visit to a house where the client would like 
to remodel the main floor and add a new kitchen, bathroom configuration, and master 
bedroom suite. You will record and document the existing conditions using SketchUp and 
LayOut to expedite the process.
Preparing for a Site Visit
Often when visiting a site, you’ll spend hours pacing off the building, sketching the footprint, 
and trying to record everything on one landscape page—or even trickier, you might try to 
break things up on multiple pages. This is a difficult task! Fortunately, there is a way to create 
your initial field sketch in 5 minutes—before you even leave the office. Follow the steps 

306
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
in this section to trace the building footprint in SketchUp and print at an ideal scale from 
LayOut onto custom grid paper.
Adding the Location
To add the location, follow these steps:
1.	 Open SketchUp and start a new model.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select Geo-Location c Add Location. In the 
search bar, type 3458 Steele St, Denver, Co, then press Enter (Figure 17.1).
3.	 Once you track down the correct residence, click the Select Region button.
4.	 Use the pins to position the selection area over the entire property (Figure 17.2).
5.	 Click the Grab button to import the selected Google Earth Snapshot and Terrain.

Figure 17.2  Grab plenty of context around the site—just in case!

307
Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
Creating the Building Footprint
To create the building footprint, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Click the File drop-down menu and 
choose Geo-Location, and uncheck 
the Show Terrain option. To do this, 
you could also use the Toggle Terrain 
button on the Google toolbar.
2.	 Trace the roof outline using the Rect-
angle tool. For this task, it is faster to 
use the Rectangle tool to trace over 
each portion of the roof rather than 
using the line tool (Figure 17.3).
TIP  Enable Length Snapping to make what seem to be loose sketches much cleaner 
with precise round measurements. Typically, when you’re tracing a site, a 1g tolerance 
for Length Snapping is ideal. Click on the Window drop-down menu and choose Model 
Info. Then click on the Units tab to adjust the length snapping features.
3.	 Using the Offset tool, offset the roof out-
line by 18g to create the exterior wall line 
(Figure 17.4).
4.	 Offset the exterior wall line by 12g to 
create the interior wall line (Figure 17.4).
5.	 Use the Eraser tool to delete any extra 
unwanted edges.
6.	 Save the model to your TEMP folder or 
appropriate project folder as BIC_3458 
Steele St – Existing Conditions.skp.
7.	 Using the Select tool, triple-click on the 
sketch of the building footprint to select 
all the connected geometry.
Figure 17.3  Use the Rectangle tool to trace the roof 
outline.
Figure 17.4  Offset the outer lines to create an esti-
mated building footprint.

308
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
8.	 Click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Make Group.
9.	 Click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Copy.
Pasting into LayOut
Typically, graph paper lines are spaced apart at 1/10g, 1/8g or 1/4g, which can make field 
sketching difficult if the drawing size is not suited to one of these scales. LayOut allows you 
to create a custom grid that matches any architectural scale, even a custom or irregular 
scale. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Start a new LayOut presentation using the BIC_8.5x11 – Landscape template.
2.	 Click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose Paste. The SketchUp geometry will be 
inserted into LayOut as a generic SketchUp model linked to the LayOut presentation, 
displayed in a viewport (Figure 17.5).
Figure 17.5  The pasted viewport in LayOut
3.	 Expand the viewport to cover the entire page.
4.	 Select the new generic viewport and adjust the properties in the SketchUp Model 
Inspector, as shown in Figure 17.6.

309
Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
Figure 17.6  The adjusted viewport and the SketchUp Model Inspector
Creating an Optimized Scale
The as-built sketch does not fit perfectly on the page at 1/8g = 1f-0g; it is too small. At 1/4g 
= 1f-0g, the drawing is too big. What you really need is an irregular scale that falls somewhere 
between these scales. In this section, you will create a custom scale in LayOut so that your 
as-built drawing is maximized on the page, giving you the most space to work with in the 
field.
1.	 Experiment with different standard scales in the SketchUp Model Inspector. You’ll see 
that a standard scale does not work well for this drawing.
2.	 At the bottom of the Scale drop-down menu, click the Add Custom Scale button.
3.	 This automatically launches the LayOut Preferences dialogue box. Technically, 1/4g 
scale is equivalent to 1g = 4f-0g, so try to work one level up; 1g = 5f-0g fits perfectly 
(Figure 17.7).

310
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 17.7  Add an irregular scale in the Preferences dialog.
4.	 Assign the 1g = 5f-0g scale to the viewport, and then resize and reposition the view-
port on the page as needed (Figure 17.8).
Figure 17.8  The 1g = 5f-0g scale maximizes the drawing on the sheet.

311
Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
Matching the Grid to Scale
Now that you have created an irregular scale to 
maximize your drawing size, you will want to match your 
grid to the irregular scale of 1g = 5f-0g (Figure 17.9). This 
will make the task of field sketching faster, easier, and 
much more accurate. Follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose 
Document Setup. Click on the Grid tab in the left 
column.
2.	 Click the Show Grid check box to toggle on the 
grid visibility.
3.	 Set the Major Grid spacing to 1g.
4.	 Set the number of divisions to 5.
5.	 While you have this tab open, check on the Print 
Grid feature.
Aligning the Drawing with the Grid
Now that the scale is set, you’ll want to align the drawing with the grid (Figure 17.10). Just 
follow these steps:
1.	 Right-click in the LayOut work area and 
check on the Grid Snap feature. This will 
allow you to perfectly align the drawing 
with the grid.
2.	 Using the Select tool, select the viewport. 
Click and drag on the Precise Move grip to 
pick it up, and then release to place it on the 
inside corner of the wall in your drawing.
3.	 Click and drag on the drawing within the 
viewport, and allow the Precise Move grip 
to snap to the grid.
TIP  At this point you could explode the building outline plan and apply a more 
complex graphic style using the Shape Style Inspector in LayOut. For instance, you 
could make the roof outline dashed and adjust line weights.
Figure 17.9  A 1g grid with five divisions 
perfectly matches the scale, 1g = 5f-0g.
Figure 17.10  Align the top-left inside corner with 
the grid.

Exporting the PDF
Now that your building outline is ready for the field, you’ll need to export  to PDF, print, and 
head to the site.
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select Export c PDF.
2.	 Save this file in your TEMP folder, or in the EXPORTS folder in the appropriate project

copies just in case.
Recording Field Notes
Recording dimensions in the field can be a tricky task. The following tips will help you stay 
organized when you’re taking notes in the field and ultimately prepare your field notes for 
importing and efficient 3D modeling.
☑
☑Record the measurements only in inches, rather than feet and inches (Figure 17.12). This 
will ultimately make modeling in SketchUp easier. For instance, write 88.75, rather than 
7f-4-3/4g. This will save you room on the page and keystrokes in SketchUp.
Figure 17.12  Record your measurements in decimal inches.

Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
☑
☑Note the inside wall-to-wall dimensions instead of trying to draw wall thicknesses at a 
small scale. If there are several different wall types/thicknesses, use a highlighter to call 
out the wall thicknesses from a wall type key. Alternatively, you can make a general 
note—for example, “all walls are 5g unless otherwise noted”—rather than dimensioning 
every wall’s thickness (Figure 17.13).
Figure 17.13  A wall key saves room on the drawings by eliminating dimensions.
☑
☑Give yourself plenty of room by always working at the largest scale possible. If the build-
ing is very large, it could make more sense to use a tabloid-size sheet or multiple letter-
size sheets.
☑
☑Use general notes to minimize repetitive notes on the field notes drawing (Figure 17.14). 
Call out general ceiling heights, door heights, finishes, etc.
Figure 17.14  Use general notes to eliminate repetitive and ambiguous notes.
☑
☑Add the overall room dimensions in the center of 
the room in a drawing (Figure 17.15). Use the same 
X-distance/Y-distance format every time.
☑
☑Record the sill heights and window heights on  
the outer perimeter of the plan, with the text  
oriented to be read from the outside of the page 
(Figure 17.16). Use the format: Sill height/Head 
height.
☑
☑Avoid using dimension lines. Record wall, window, 
and door dimensions within the building drawing 
oriented in line with the dimensions they define 
(Figure 17.17).
Figure 17.15  Overall room dimen-
sions provide a reality check to 
insure that all measurements add 
up correctly.

314
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
☑
☑Record the wall locations only on the main plan. Bring letter-sized tracing paper to docu-
ment additional layers, such as equipment (Figure 17.18), reflected ceiling plans, framing, 
etc. This will help you keep your drawing clean and organized. Be sure to mark where 
each drawing sits by tracing the corners of your plan (Figure 17.19).

recorded on a separate piece of trace paper.

The As-Built 3D Model
Creating the as-built 3D model is possibly the most important step in the design process 
for a renovation project. All design decisions will be made from this model, so it must be 
extremely accurate. Any mistakes made here will carry through every model and drawing 
you create, and ultimately these mistakes will drastically affect the actual construction!
Importing the Field Notes
To import your field notes, follow these steps:
1.	 Scan all the pages of your field notes and save them in the IMAGES folder for the 
project. To maintain your organization, create a subfolder in the IMAGES folder and 
name it YYMMDD_Field Measurements, using today's date. To complete this exer-
cise you will use the scanned field notes from the class files folder.

316
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 In SketchUp, open the BIC_3458 Steele St - Existing Conditions.skp file.
3.	 In the Layers dialog, turn off the Google Earth Snapshot and Google Earth Terrain 
layers.
4.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select Import. Set the Files of Type setting 
to All Supported Image Types. If you don’t, you won’t be able to see your scanned 
image files. Make sure the Use as Image radio button is activated for the import type 
(Figure 17.20).
5.	 Navigate to the TSWFA folder and select the BIC_3458 Steele St - Main Level 
Floor Plan.jpg scan and click the Open button.
Figure 17.20  The Import settings
6.	 Click once to place the image, and then move your cursor away to scale the image. 
You don’t need to be exact right now because you will scale precisely in the next step 
(Figure 17.21). Click again to finish placing the image.
7.	 Right-click on the image and select Explode. Exploding an image converts it to a sur-
face with a material applied to it. The material’s texture image is the imported image.
8.	 Double-click the surface, and then right-click and choose Make Group.
9.	 Select the new group containing the field notes; in the Entity Info dialog, assign the 
CONC – Background layer.

Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
Figure 17.21  You don’t need to be precise when you insert the image.
Scaling the Field Notes
After you insert the field notes, you’ll need to scale them.
1.	 Activate the Tape Measure tool. Find a known dimension. Measure the overall dis-
tance of the building and remember that distance (Figure 17.22).
Figure 17.22  Measure the overall length of the 
building outline.

318
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Using the Select tool, double-click into the Field Notes group.
3.	 Using the Tape Measure tool, measure that same overall distance on the field notes 
(Figure 17.23).
Figure 17.23  Measure the same overall length of the field notes image.
4.	 Immediately after the second click, enter what the actual distance should be, then 
press Enter. This is the distance that you remembered from step 1, in this example 29' 
10 3/8”, although on your model this distance might be slightly different.
5.	 SketchUp asks if you would like to “resize the active group or component.” Choose 
Yes. This sets the measurement to be the same as what you just typed in.
6.	 Close the Field Notes Drawing group.
7.	 Perform a precise move to align the field notes drawing with the original building 
footprint sketch (Figure 17.24).
8.	 Right-click on the Field Notes group and select Lock.
9.	 Delete the original building footprint sketch. You no longer need it.
10.	Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Save.

Modeling from the Field Notes
Now you are ready to draft the existing conditions. 
The beauty of this technique is that there is no need 
to look back and forth between your field notes 
and the computer because your field notes are 
already in the model.
1.	 Draw a square at 12g n 12g in the corner of 
the plan (Figure 17.25).
2.	 Push/pull the square up to the recorded ceil-
ing height of 8f4g (Figure 17.26).
3.	 Using the Push/Pull tool, extrude the plan 
horizontally (Figure 17.27, Figure 17.28). 
As you are push/pulling, tap the Ctrl key 
(Option key on Mac) to toggle the Create 
New Starting Face command. This leaves a 
copy of the starting face and edges behind 
Figure 17.25  Square drawn in the southwest  
corner of the plan

320

and allows you to mark horizontal breaks and openings. Leave a starting face at every 
major opening, such as walls, doors, and windows.

recorded ceiling height to begin to form the 
exterior walls.

Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
4.	 Navigate to the outside of the model. Use the Move tool to copy the bottom lines 
of the door and window openings up to the noted sill heights, and then again for the 
head heights (Figure 17.29, Figure 17.30, Figure 17.31).
Figure 17.29  Use the Move tool to copy 
edges up to the sill heights noted on the 
field notes drawing. (Southwest corner of the 
plan is shown.)
TIP  You can create the openings using several different methods. You could use the 
Tape Measure tool to create guides, and then use the Rectangle or Line tool to create 
the rest of the opening. Use the tools and methods that you find the most efficient.

well as any unwanted geometry on the outside walls. Leave behind all of the lines that 
define the openings.
6.	 Use the Push/Pull tool to create all major openings as shown in Figure 17.32. Push 
from the outside of the house in. After creating the first opening, you can double-
click on the other openings and use the memory of the Push/Pull tool.

7.	 Select all of the new walls, right-click on the selection, and choose Make Group.
8.	 Draw the interior walls using the same techniques. Leave a starting face at all major 
openings for the doors and arches, and to turn the corners. When you are finished, 
select all interior walls and make them a group as well.
Layering and Organizing
You need to organize your model from the moment you begin creating it and continue that 
organization throughout the process. To start organizing the model, follow these steps:
1.	 Select both groups of walls: interior and exterior.
2.	 Right-click on the selection and choose Make Group.
3.	 Right-click on the group and choose Entity Info.
4.	 In the Entity Info dialog, assign the ARCH – Walls layer to the group containing the 
walls (Figure 17.33).
Figure 17.33  Walls
5.	 Using the Select tool, double-click into the new group of walls. In the Entity Info dia-
log, assign the Exterior Walls group to the CONC – Exterior layer and assign the Inte-
rior Walls group to the CONC – Interior layer (Figure 17.34).

6.	 Double-click into the Exterior walls. Select all of the exterior walls, right-click on the 
selection and choose Make Group. Assign the group to the CONC – Existing layer, as 
shown in Figure 17.35.
7.	 Double-click into the interior walls. Select all of the interior walls, right-click on the 
selection, and choose Make Group. Assign the group to the CONC – Existing layer, as 
shown in Figure 17.35.

Adding Detail
Now you are ready to add the doors, windows, fixtures, floors, and stairs using the same 
organization techniques, as shown in Figure 17.37. The components shown are available in 
the chapter files you downloaded earlier from www.suexch.com/TSWFA. To complete your 
existing conditions model, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down and choose Import.  Make sure that the Files of Type 
drop-down is set to SketchUp Models (*.skp).
2.	 Navigate to your class files folder for this chapter and select the Fixtures.skp compo-
nent. Click on the Open button to finish the import.
3.	 Assign the ARCH - Fixtures layer to the Fixtures.skp component.
4.	 Continue to insert components and apply the model organization and layering strate-
gies shown in Figure 17.36.

Chapter 17: Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building
TIP  Completely finish the as-built 3D model before you move on to the design 
phases. To move forward immediately, you could use the completed model from your 
chapter files.
Working with Existing CAD Drawings
If you already have DWGs, you might not need to go out and take field notes at the site. You 
can simply import the .dwg files and trace over them using the same techniques and model 
organization you would use to trace an image of your field notes. The only difference would 
be that you have points to snap to rather than handwritten dimensions. Here are a few tips 
that will help you when you’re working with someone else’s CAD drawings:
☑
☑Don’t always trust someone else’s CAD work. Use the CAD cleanup scripts (available at 
www.smustard.com) in SketchUp, or better yet open the DWGs in your CAD program 
and run Flatten, Overkill, and Purge commands.
☑
☑In SketchUp, extrude the plan horizontally rather than trying to fill in the plan and 
extrude vertically.
☑
☑When you use the File c Import dialog, be sure to set Files of Type to .dwg.
☑
☑Group the CAD drawing, add to the CONC – Background layer, and lock just as you did 
with the field notes.
Chapter Points
☑
☑When you’re recording dimensions, develop a system and stick to it.
☑
☑It is absolutely critical that you complete the accurate and organized as-built 3D model 
before you move on to the design phases.
☑
☑Download the BIC_Field Note – Letter Landscape.layout template at www.suexch.com 
and save to your RESOURCES/­TEMPLATES folder. This template is set up with spaces for the 
critical information that you will typically record when you are completing as-built drawings.

Chapter 18
Schematic Design
D
uring the schematic design (SD) phase, you interpret the site 
analysis (SA) data and develop the initial draft presentation of your 
design ideas. In this section, you will learn how to efficiently organize 
your model for rendering, sharing with consultants, exporting to other 
CAD programs, and preparing for construction documents.
Remodel Design
Now that you’ve collected all the data during the SA phase, it’s time to utilize it. In this section, 
you’ll further develop the 3D as-built model and transform it into a design model. Working 
with existing conditions lends itself to precise modeling. If you are working from an accurate 
as-built, there is no need to convolute it with new inaccurate “sketchy” geometry. Stick with 
the plan and continue to treat this model as a pristine, accurate, and organized model.
Proposed Conditions Model
The proposed conditions model is where you will demolish select existing conditions 
and add your new design. At this point, having a complete existing conditions model is 
imperative. In the future, any changes you make to the existing conditions model will need 
to be duplicated in your new proposed conditions model. So make sure you take the time 
to accurately finish the as-built model. When you are ready to transition your existing 
conditions model to a proposed conditions model, just follow these steps:
1.	 In SketchUp, open the BIC_3458 Steele St – Existing Conditions.skp model 
from Chapter 17, “Site Analysis: Documenting an Existing Building.”

329
Chapter 18: Schematic Design
2.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and select Save As.
3.	 Name the file BIC_3458 Steele St – Proposed Conditions.skp.
4.	 Navigate to your TEMP folder or the appropriate project folder and click the Save 
button.
Demolition
Often, you will need to demolish portions of an existing building in order to complete your 
renovation. Within the model, simply remove the walls you want to demolish and delete any 
entities you do not want as part of your design.
If at some point you need to restore a demolished entity, you can copy it from the exist-
ing conditions model and paste it in place in the proposed conditions model. For walls, it is 
fairly intuitive to just redraw them in the existing container.
There is no need to save anything that is being demolished in the proposed conditions 
model. You will see in Chapter 20 “Construction Documents” that the the demolition plan is 
a product of the existing conditions model combined with the proposed conditions model.
New Construction
To complete the design, you’ll need to add new walls and entities to your model. To do 
that, all you need to do is add one more layer “switch”, or level of organization to the model. 
Within each of the ARCH groups, at the same level as the CONC – Existing container, add a 
container assigned to the CONC – New layer. This is where you will add new entities based 
on the container on which you are working (Figure 18.1). Add a CONC – New container to 
each of the ARCHITECTURAL layers as you are adding the new entities.
Figure 18.1  A remodeling project will utilize the CONC – New and  
CONC – Existing layers.

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Scope Diagram
When you’re working on a remodel design, you can view the model as a Scope Diagram 
to see which entities are new and which are existing (Figure 18.2). This will help you make 
informed design decisions visually, without always having to check the layering of the model.
Open the completed BIC_3458 Steele St - Proposed Conditions.skp model from the 
chapter files. Click on the scope diagram’s Scene tab and explore the model’s organization 
strategies and layering.
Figure 18.2  Existing entities are gray and new entities are green.
Project Types
Every project requires different layers, different containers, and different organizational 
strategies. It is always best to think through your project’s requirements before you start the 
model. When you approach and organize your models, keep the following tips in mind:
☑
☑Identify the layers your model will need based on what drawings you need. If you don’t 
need a Finish Plan, you might not need to use the ARCH – Floor Finishes container and 
layer. If your model has only one floor, you won’t need the CONC – Level 00 layers.
☑
☑A new construction project will not need the CONC – Existing or CONC – New layers 
because everything will be new.

331
Chapter 18: Schematic Design
☑
☑A rowhouse model might have several layers for the units, such as CONC – Unit A, 
CONC – Unit B, CONC – Unit C, etc.
☑
☑A campus model might have several layers for individual buildings, such as CONC – 
Building 1, CONC – Building 2, CONC – Building 3, etc.
☑
☑One of the simplest project types would be a one-level new-construction project.
☑
☑One of the most complex project types would be a multilevel, multiunit remodel.
☑
☑Think of each of the ARCH and SITE layers as nouns and the CONC layers as adjectives 
that describe the ARCH and SITE entities.
☑
☑Become comfortable with your location in the model. Pay attention to visual cues that 
identify the organizational levels of your model. Practice navigating the groups and com-
ponents (use the Select tool, double-click, and the Esc key).
It is impossible to create one template that accommodates every project type. This 
means you’ll be adding layers to almost all the new models on which you work. When you 
use the Layer dialog to add a layer, the newly added layer is visible by default in every scene. 
When you use the Add Hidden Layer ruby (see Chapter 8, “Ruby Scripts”), the new layer will 
be invisible in all existing scenes, which is more desirable.
Models have different needs. Visit www.suexch.com/TSWFA to see several 
models and model organization diagrams that represent different project scopes 
and types.
ACTIVITY
Modeling Strategy
At this point, it should be very clear that you can be very loose and sketchy in SketchUp, 
or you can be accurate and precise. Just as each project type has a unique organizational 
strategy, each project type has a unique modeling strategy. There are two schools of 
thought: model sketchy and then clean up, or model precisely from the beginning. There 
is no one right way to design in SketchUp, but some of the suggestions presented here can 
help you determine how SketchUp is best leveraged.
Sketchy Modeling
If you model without paying attention to precise dimensions, you are creating a throw-away 
model. When you create sketchy models, the amount of effort you’ll need to edit the loose 

332
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
geometry back into precision is not worth the time it would take. Typically, it is easier to 
rebuild the design in a new file after you have poured your thoughts into the sketchy model. 
If you are going to model in this way, keep these tips in mind:
☑
☑Turn on length snapping to make the sketchy dimensions snap to a clean, round num-
ber. This will make it a little easier to transition if you are cutting and pasting into your 
precise model.
☑
☑Group everything! Once geometry is stuck together, it becomes much more difficult 
(but not impossible) to sort it all out.
☑
☑Assume that your sketchy model is going to be a throw-away model. Usually, it takes 
more effort to edit the geometry back into precise dimensions than it would to rebuild 
the model.
☑
☑During the Schematic Design phase, create a programming diagram, mass models, and 
quick plan sketches without being too hung up on precise modeling practices.
☑
☑A new construction project lends itself to brainstorming on a larger and freer scale, and 
sometimes without paying close attention to precise dimensions. Because you aren’t lim-
ited by the constraints of an existing building, you are free to develop any style and space 
plan you desire.
Precise Modeling
Modeling with exact dimensions right from the beginning is the best method. Even though 
it is easy to push, pull, move, and scale without being precise, there is really no reason to 
do that. Keep your dimensions clean from the beginning by organizing your model and 
performing accurate operations. If you are going to model in this way, keep these tips in mind:
☑
☑If you have used a sketch model, or concept, then start a new file to create the SD/DD/
CD model.
☑
☑Move groups, components, and entities between groups and components and even 
other files using the Paste in Place command. Copy or cut a selection, and once you are 
inside the desired model or container, click on the Edit drop-down menu and choose 
Paste in Place.
☑
☑From the beginning, a remodeling project lends itself to precise modeling because you 
need to work within the constraints of the existing construction.

333
Chapter 18: Schematic Design
Level of Detail
You need to determine the level of detail that should be included in your models. If you are 
creating a building model to be used for design, presentation, and construction documents, 
you should think in terms of 1/8g plans. Typically, generic wall thicknesses provide plenty of 
detail, either to studs or including gypsum board. You don’t need to model layers for drywall, 
studs, or plates in the main design model; you only need to include generic thicknesses and 
openings (Figure 18.3). Excessive detail is usually unnecessary, and it will slow you down. You 
can describe any detail beyond that in a detail drawing, detached from the main, proposed-
conditions, design model.
Figure 18.3  Wall, floor, and ceiling masses are typically enough  
detail to create the drawings needed to describe a design.
Objects
Approaching and modeling objects is a challenging task. Typically, everyday objects that 
make a convincing scene are “organic” in shape. Many modelers approach these objects with 
the standard SketchUp modeling tools, which ultimately creates a hard-lined object that 
was obviously modeled in SketchUp (Figure 18.4). When you’re modeling objects, keep the 
following tips in mind:
☑
☑Examine the object to determine the details that make it unique and recognizable.

334
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
☑
☑Think about your approach. What basic 
forms can be modified to create the desired 
object? Is an additive approach the best? Or 
would the subtractive approach be better?
☑
☑You will probably come to the conclusion 
that it is worth it to pay for professionally built 
models of objects at www.formfonts.com.
Many objects have a 3D form that produces 
the correct graphic when it is rendered in a 
plan— for example, couches, sinks, counters, 
and toilets (Figure 18.5).
Figure 18.5  The toilet component renders properly in 3D as well 
as in plan.
There are also many objects that have a 3D form that does not render correctly in plan. 
Some examples are doors, upper cabinets, and electrical outlets. To help you understand 
this concept, realize that a door shown in plan has a very graphical representation (Fig-
ure 18.6). Slicing through a three-dimensional door with a section plane will not produce 
the graphic you need for a plan. For any object like this, there will be a 3D object that will be

essarily a real style. The stylized chair (at

visible in perspective and elevation views, and a 2D graphic that will be visible in plan views 
(Figure 18.7).
Exporting to CAD
At some point you may want to move your SketchUp design into your favorite CAD program. 
The Model Organization tools in this book make it simple to export your design as a 2D or 3D 
model—and share your design with consultants so that engineering drawings can be completed. 
Typically, consultants do not work with SketchUp, so you will need to either export to a 3D 
format they can work with or to a 2D format that is easily adapted to their layering system.
Exporting 3D
Exporting your SketchUp model to another 3D model format is the easiest way to 
communicate with other programs. Depending on your needs, this method does not always

will allow the object to be represented properly in 
any drawing.

336
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
provide the flexibility needed to utilize the model. If you do want to export to another 3D 
format, follow these steps:
1.	 Within SketchUp, click on the File drop-down menu 
and select Export c 3D Model (Figure 18.8).
2.	 Click on the Export Type drop-down menu and 
select the desired format. You can export to several 
formats, including .dae, .kmz, .3ds, .dwg, .dxf, .fbx, 
.obj, .wrl, and .xsi.
3.	 Click the Options button to adjust specific settings 
relating to the file type you are exporting. They will 
be different for each export file type.
4.	 Navigate to the TEMP folder (or the appropriate EXPORTS folder), add a YYMMDD 
folder, and then click the Export button to finish. A 3D model export maintains all 
layering and grouping; component instances are turned to blocks and maintain their 
connectivity.
TIP  Exporting to Revit is the elusive holy grail of SketchUp workflow efficiency. The 
problem is that Revit is a completely different type of program than SketchUp. There is no 
clean, seamless import workflow that pulls all the intelligence from SketchUp and translates 
directly into the Revit format. Think about everything you have learned about the way that 
SketchUp works. There are no walls, floors, doors, or windows in SketchUp. You know what 
these entities are because you are putting them in containers and assigning layers. SketchUp 
can’t communicate them to Revit because Revit actually has walls, doors, and windows. The 
best thing to do is import the 3D model as a mass and trace it in Revit. Another option is to 
import the 2D CAD drawings and trace those while applying the entity properties.
Exporting 2D
Typically, you export to 2D CAD to move into another CAD program, or you might just 
need to share 2D CAD backgrounds with other consultants. A major benefit of 2D CAD is 
that it is fairly fast and easy to use, and almost everyone in the design field knows how to use 
it. Sometimes you just need to get the job done. It is okay to think and design in SketchUp 
3D, and then refine and document your design in a familiar 2D CAD program. The SketchUp 
Workflow for Architecture is extremely flexible, so don’t hesitate to abandon ship at this point 
and use another program if that is what works for you.
Exporting to 2D CAD that everyone can use has different challenges. The main one is 
that the layers in most CAD programs are not set up the way they are in SketchUp. You can 
Figure 18.8  The AutoCAD  
Export Options dialog box

337
Chapter 18: Schematic Design
get around this by exporting 2D DWGs from SketchUp to CAD by layers or line weights. You 
will export once for the doors, windows, walls, fixtures, etc., and then export another set 
based on new and existing (Figure 18.9).
Figure 18.9  Exporting a separate .dwg file for each layer used in 
CAD gives consultants the flexibility to build any plan they need. 
Each scene will be its own .dwg export and its own external refer-
ence to the consultant’s background drawings.
Creating the Export Model
If at all possible, you should always reference the proposed conditions model into another 
file in order to export the 2D backgrounds. Doing so limits the number of Scene tabs and 
clutter within the main design model. Follow these steps:
1.	 Start a new SketchUp model.
2.	 Within SketchUp, click on the File drop-down menu and choose Import.
3.	 Navigate to and select the BIC_3458 Steele St – Proposed Conditions.skp model. 
Click the Open button to finish the import.
4.	 Save the model as BIC_3458 Steele St – Backgrounds in the appropriate project folder.

338
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Creating Scenes
Now it’s time to set up the scenes that represent each piece of the .dwg backgrounds. You 
can visualize the scenes using a SOD (scene organization diagram) for the existing walls 
(Figure 18.10) and a SOD for the new walls (Figure 18.11). The 3D views shown in the figures 
are in perspective for effect; they will actually be top-down parallel projection views.
Figure 18.10  Swap the ARCH – Walls layer for other ARCH layers to create 
additional existing export scenes.

339
Chapter 18: Schematic Design
Figure 18.11  Swap the ARCH – Walls layer for other ARCH layers to create 
additional new export scenes.
1.	 Adjust the layer visibility, style, and shadow settings to reflect the desired background 
export.
2.	 In the Scenes dialog, click on the plus sign (+) to add a new scene.
3.	 Repeat this process for each desired background export.

340
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
TIP  Every scene you create must have the same camera view. To ensure that they 
are all the same, set the camera view to top, select all of the BKGD scenes in the 
Scenes dialog, and then click the Scene Update button; update only the camera view 
and uncheck all other properties. Click Update. Now all the scenes have the same 
camera view.
Exporting 2D Graphic
Now that you have scenes created, export them to a .dwg for use in other CAD programs.
1.	 Click on the File drop-down menu and choose Export c 2D Graphic (Figure 18.12).
2.	 Click on the Export Type drop-down 
menu and choose .dwg.
3.	 Click on the Options button to open 
the Export Options dialog. Set the 
format to ACAD 2000. (The year 
2000 is a pretty good year for com-
patibility between software pack-
ages and CAD versions. If you know 
exactly the version you need, choose 
it instead.)
4.	 Navigate to the appropriate 
EXPORTS folder, and add a folder 
with today’s date in the YYMMDD 
format to keep things organized.
5.	 Click the Export button to finish.
Using the DWG Exports
Once all of the exports are completed, 
they can be compiled into a single CAD 
drawing to create any type of plan needed 
(Figure 18.13). Ideally, you will email all of these background .dwg files to consultants, or host 
them for download on a server. Then, the consultants can insert the drawings into their 
CAD program however they like. When you update the design, re-export the backgrounds 
and then just send a message to the consultants so they know to download and overwrite 
Figure 18.12  The 2D Export dialog

341
Chapter 18: Schematic Design
their files. This method is by far the most efficient way to keep everyone on the same page, 
but it requires all consultants to be proficient in 2D CAD.
For consultants who don’t really know how to use CAD this way, you might find it easier 
to just do it for them. Simply reference the DWG exports into your favorite CAD program 
to create a series of drawings for them. Be sure to maintain the drawing origin for each refer-
ence, to insure that all drawings stack right into place. At this point, assign line weights to 
each of the external references as a whole.
TIP  If you don’t have a CAD program to compile the drawings, you can import all the 
drawings into SketchUp as .dwg files, and then export the entire file as a 3D .dwg.
Figure 18.13  This proposed plan was created by referencing several .dwg exports from 
SketchUp into a 2D CAD program. Each .dwg reference is on a different colored layer, each 
different color represents the possibility for varying line weights.

342
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
You can also use the 2D export to abandon ship, and then finish the documentation in 
your favorite 2D CAD program. Reference the files in the same, and then you can explode, 
redraw, and modify your file at will. Keep in mind that when you export 2D CAD snap-
shots, there is no connectivity between the components—they do not become blocks. 
These DWGs are basically exploded, simple linework and might require some rebuilding and 
redrawing.

☑While you’re brainstorming in SketchUp, use the tools loosely and freely. Keep in mind 
that there are built-in ways to tighten up the dimensions and keep the geometry orga-
nized, even in a concept model.
☑
☑When moving a concept to a precise model, it is usually best to start a fresh model. Use 
Paste in Place to pull useful pieces of the concept model into the precise model.
☑
☑Typically, it is best to use precise dimensions and modeling techniques right from the 
beginning. Once you get the hang of the model organization and tool operations, it 
takes just as much effort to create a sketchy model as it does a precise model.
☑
☑A cloud file storage solution comes in really handy when you’re distributing lots of large 
files to consultants.

Rendering
D
uring the Design Development phase, it is often necessary to 
present a refined design in 3D. By doing this, you will enable the 
client to fully understand the design and sign off so you can quickly move 
on to the Construction Documents phase. Throughout the architectural 
design process, you will still use the modeling and organization 
techniques from the previous chapters, but in this chapter you’ll focus on 
presentation. You’ll learn how to create beautiful SketchUp animations 
and renderings, prepare your model for photorealistic rendering, and 
explore your photorealistic rendering options.
Populating a Scene
Any image you create will ultimately be used to sell an idea. Your design image should evoke 
excitement and the desire to be a participant in the image. You should put as much thought 
into populating your renderings as a realtor puts into staging a house for sale. Breathe life 
into the space by adding decorative objects, people, and action. Keep the following tips in 
mind when you’re populating a scene.

344
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
☑
☑Address your audience. Who are you selling this design to, and what will get them 
excited about the space? Now is a good time to think back to your first meetings when 
the client expressed their main desires. If they expressed a strong desire for a fireplace, 
show the fireplace glowing with a family gathered around.
☑
☑Add decorative objects within the ARCH - Furniture container (Figure 19.1, Figure 19.2). 
Tables without food, magazines, or other details are boring. Such details are the objects 
that make a scene realistic; however, you don’t want them to render in the furniture plan.
Figure 19.1  Decorative objects such as magazines, plates, and 
pillows liven up a scene, but are not necessary to render in plan. 
Such entities belong on the ARCH – Decorative Objects layer.

Chapter 19: Design Development Rendering
☑
☑Download professionally modeled and textured components at www.FormFonts.com.
☑
☑Use custom textures from Google image searches or from FormFonts. See Chapter 7, 
“SketchUp Collections.”
☑
☑To sell the experience, populate models with people participating in appropriate activities. 
Add them to the SITE – Entourage container. For winter scenes, use people in jackets.  At a 
restaurant, mix casually and professionally dressed people. For an office, add activity such as 
presentations and collaborative group discussions. Perform a Google search for office and 
investigate what a real office looks like. Take note of the clutter that can add realism to an 
image, then apply those subtle nuances when staging your scenes. (Figure 19.3, Figure 19.4).
Figure 19.3  This scene lacks decorative objects and people. The 
space is accurately represented, but the viewer has no idea how 
the space will be used.

and people give the viewer an idea of how the space will be used.

346
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Rendering in SketchUp
SketchUp renderings are traditionally “sketchy.” Utilizing the loose lines and cartoonish 
materials available in SketchUp conveys design intent in a way that is much softer than a 
sharp photorealistic rendering.
Choosing an Appropriate Style
A style will drastically affect the way in which your audience receives your SketchUp 
rendering. If your design is still in a loose schematic state, present it with a sketchy style to 
remove some of the details you haven’t thought out. If your design is fairly complete and 
advanced, use a hard-line style rather than a sketchy style to insure the details are clearly 
represented. See Figure 19.5, Figure 19.6, and Figure 19.7.
Figure 19.5  A sketchy style rendered in Hidden Line mode leaves 
much of the detail to the viewer’s imagination or presenter’s expla-
nation, which is great for designs that are still in schematics. If you 
haven’t addressed the materials, don't show them.

347
Chapter 19: Design Development Rendering
Figure 19.6  If a design is well developed, a sketchy style can sometimes come across as 
messy and cluttered.
Figure 19.7  A style with clean lines and textures is best for a design that has been well 
developed.
Creating Scenes
After you determine the style you want to use, you can create the scene.
1.	 Navigate to a desired view, and then select an appropriate style from the Style 
browser. You might want to click on the PRESENTATION utility scene tab and use 
the final PRESENTATION style that was created in Chapter 5, “The Professional’s 
SketchUp Template.”
TIP  Use the Advanced Camera tools and Position Camera tools to place yourself in 
the model accurately, set the eye height, etc.

348
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 To add a new scene, click on the plus sign (+) at the top-right corner of the Scenes dialog.
3.	 Using the LO_ format, rename the scene LO_Perspective 01. Check on all of the 
Properties to Save.
4.	 Repeat to create additional scenes.
Exporting Images from SketchUp
The easiest way to produce an image is to use the Export 2D Graphic command in SketchUp. 
This creates a 2D snapshot of the screen in several 
formats, including raster and vector.
1.	 Click on the Scene tab that you would like 
to export.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down and select 
Export 2D Graphic.
3.	 Set the Export Type to .jpg if you plan to 
print or email the rendering as is. This is 
one of the most common raster-image for-
mats. If you plan to perform a lot of post-
processing, consider exporting the scene 
as a .tiff file.
4.	 Click on the Options button to set the 
image resolution as shown in Figure 19.8.
Exporting Images from LayOut
Exporting images from LayOut is a very efficient way to export multiple views from 
SketchUp, and it allows you to leverage all of LayOut’s professional export settings.
Adding Pages
Add a page within your LayOut presentation for each perspective rendering scene you 
created in SketchUp. Just follow these steps:
1.	 Within LayOut, start a new file using the BIC_8.5x11 – Landscape template. Save this 
file to your TEMP folder or an appropriate project folder and name the file BIC_Row 
House – Renderings.layout.
Figure 19.8  Image export options

349
Chapter 19: Design Development Rendering
2.	 Click on the File drop-down and choose Insert. Navigate to the BIC_Denver Row 
House.skp model in the chapter files folder, select it, and click the Open button.
3.	 Click and drag on the edge of a viewport to loosely resize the viewport. Once you 
let go, immediately enter new viewport dimensions: 11g, 8.5g, then press Enter 
(Figure 19.9).
Figure 19.9  Use the Select tool to scale a viewport with pre-
cise dimensions.
4.	 Center on the page horizontally and vertically. To do that, use the Custom Arrange 
toolbar, or right-click on the viewport and select Center c Horizontally on Page and 
repeat for Center c Vertically on Page.
5.	 Select the viewport, and then assign the LO_Perspective 01 scene, rendering type, 
and line weight in the SketchUp Model Inspector.
6.	 Duplicate the page and repeat the process for every desired scene.
Exporting Multiple Images
Although it is usually best to export a .pdf file, sometimes you’ll want to export a series 
of images for post-processing in an image editor. Follow these steps to batch export raster 
images from LayOut.
1.	 Click on the File drop-down and choose Export c Images.

350
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Navigate to the appropriate project folder, 
assign an appropriate name, choose a .jpg or 
.png export, and click on Save.
3.	 In the Image Export Options dialog, which is 
automatically launched, choose which LayOut 
presentation pages will be exported as well 
as the image resolution (Figure 19.10). Typi-
cally, 300 pixels/inch is an acceptable high-­
resolution export for print, and 72 pixels/inch 
is an acceptable resolution for screen presenta-
tions, such as a website.
TIP  It is okay to keep your large-format renderings 
in a separate LayOut presentation from your 
drawings. You can link one SketchUp model to as 
many LayOut presentations as you like.
Creating Animations
SketchUp animations are easy to create, and they provide an excellent way to explore a 3D 
space without having the model open and rendering in real time.
Creating an Animation Model
To create an animation file, follow these steps:
1.	 Within SketchUp, click on the File drop-down and select New to start a new model.
2.	 Click on the File drop-down and choose Import. Verify that the Files of Type drop-
down menu is set to SketchUp Files (*.skp).
Inserting one SketchUp model into another creates a link between the instance and 
the referenced model. This technique will limit the number of scenes and Scene tabs 
in the proposed conditions model. When you make changes to the original BIC_­
Denver Row House.skp model, you can just right-click on the reference in the Anima-
tion file and select Reload to see the updated model.
Figure 19.10  LayOut image export 
options

351
Chapter 19: Design Development Rendering
3.	 Navigate to and select the BIC_Denver Row House.skp file. Click the Open button 
to import the model.
4.	 Save the file as BIC_Denver Row House – Animation.skp.
Adding Scenes
SketchUp animations are scene based. This means that SketchUp will link together all of the 
scenes in the animation into one movie. Be sure to check on all of the properties to save and 
choose which scenes should be included in 
the animation (Figure 19.11). Typically, every 
scene you create in the animation file will be 
included in the animation.
1.	 In the Scenes browser, click the Add 
New Scene button to create a new 
scene.
2.	 Name the scenes based on seg-
ments. For example, each scene in the 
first stream of animation should be 
titled 01.
3.	 Click on the Window drop-down and 
choose Model Info. Click on the Ani-
mations tab.
4.	 Check on the Scene Transitions and 
adjust the amount of time between 
scenes based on personal prefer-
ence. Typically, you should leave the 
Scene Delay set to 0 for a more fluid 
animation.
Exporting Animations
To export your animation, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the File drop-down and choose Export c Animation.
Figure 19.11  In SketchUp’s Scenes dialog, 
the Include in Animation box is checked for 
each ANIM scene.

352
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
2.	 Click the Options button at the bottom- 
left corner of the Export Animation dialog  
(Figure 19.12).
3.	 Navigate to your TEMP folder or an appro-
priate project folder, and select Export.
Animation Tips
Keep the following tips in mind when you’re 
creating animations in SketchUp.
☑
☑Add a sky dome to the animation file to create 
a more realistic sky effect. Search the 3D ware-
house for sky dome (Figure 19.13).
☑
☑Use ruby scripts to make your animations 
smoother. Visit www.smustard.com to pur-
chase and experiment with Flight Path, Page 
Smoother, TimeEdit, and PageDelayEdit.
☑
☑The dimensions for high definition 1080p are 
1920 pixels wide by 1080 pixels high. Thin out 
lines by exporting at a higher resolution, such 
as 3840 n 2160, and then crunching the file 
down in a video editor.
☑
☑Each instance of SketchUp utilizes one core. 
Therefore, if you have a quad-core system, you 
could maximize your machine by opening 
four instances of SketchUp and rendering the 
animation in four separate segments, and then 
compiling the segments in a video editor. To 
do this, you would need one animation file 
with all of the scenes set up. Every time you 
opened the animation file, you would need 
to uncheck different scenes to include in the 
animation.
☑
☑With more time between scene transitions, 
the camera will appear to fly slower.

Figure 19.13  A sky dome places a 
picture of a real sky behind an image, 
which will look better than a simple 
color sky.

353
Chapter 19: Design Development Rendering
☑
☑A higher frame rate will allow you to slow down an animation in a video editor without 
deteriorating the quality.
☑
☑By using simple video editing programs such as Windows Movie Maker or iMovie, you 
can add a lot to your animations. For example, you can add captions, fade effects, and 
chop out the “bouncing” effect often present in scene based animations.
☑
☑Sketchy styles do not typically render well in animations.
Photorealistic Rendering
Once a design has reached a level of detail that resembles a real space, it is best to render 
it as a photorealistic image. Photorealistic renderings make typical “cartoony” SketchUp 
renderings look real by adding soft shadows, reflections, light sources, and other natural 
properties of light.
TIP  If a design is incomplete and isn’t populated, your photorealistic rendering will 
look amateurish.
In the not-so-distant past, photorealistic rendering was a huge task involving exporting to 
expensive software packages that only Hollywood studios could afford and only Hollywood 
special effects wizards knew how to use. Today, photorealistic rendering can be accomplished 
in SketchUp. Most rendering plugins are extremely inexpensive, and they produce beautiful 
images that rival professional stand-alone rendering software (Figure 19.14, Figure 19.15).

The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture

Preparing a Model
Photorealistic rendering is a breeze with many of the available plugins for SketchUp, but 
you should first optimize the model for rendering using the Orient Faces utility scene 
(Figure 19.16). This utility scene displays the geometry in your model based on which side of 
the surface is facing you. The front is pink and the backs are green. Rendering the front of 
faces will produce more predictable results.
1.	 Click on the Orient Faces utility scene tab.
2.	 Double-click into Groups and Components, and then right-click on a green face and 
choose Reverse Faces to change it to pink. You can select multiple faces, right-click on 
the selection, and choose Reverse Faces to change more than one face at a time.
3.	 Click on the Design utility tab to verify that the correct material is applied to the sur-
face. Usually, after reversing a face, you will need to apply a material to the front that 
was previously hidden.
4.	 Reverse the rest of the faces until all of them are pink.

355
Chapter 19: Design Development Rendering
Figure 19.16  The Orient Faces utility scene makes it easy to identify the 
front and back of faces. Typically, your results will be more consistent when 
your render the fronts of surfaces.

Post-Processing
It is always a good idea to run your final images through an image processor to fine-tune 
the brightness, contrast, color balance, etc. GIMP and Adobe Photoshop are powerful image 
editors that you install locally on your computer. There are also several image editors that 
can accomplish many of the same tasks for less money. Several cloud-based image editors 
are listed here:

Chapter 20
Construction 
Documents
D
uring the CD phase, you (or the designer) will document all of the 
final design decisions and compile them into a set of construction 
documents. These documents are the culmination of The SketchUp 
Workflow for Architecture, and they are where all of your hard work 
and organization really pay off. In this section, you will see that you 
can create construction documents in LayOut and that the process is 
actually very efficient.
Crucial Concepts for Documentation
Before you create the construction documents, you should understand some basic concepts 
that will help you create your drawings quickly and efficiently.
Section Planes
Section planes are the key to describing 3D spaces in 2D diagrams. Most people think 
section planes are just used for building sections; but really, any plan is also created using a 
section plane, placed horizontally (Figure 20.1).

358
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Horizontal section planes can be placed at the main level of the model or in an ARCH con-
tainer if needed. One reason for placing the section plane in an ARCH container is to cut differ-
ent entities at different heights. Multiple section planes allow you to control which entities are 
being cut at what height (Figure 20.2). 
For instance, you might want the 
exterior walls to be cut at a different 
height than the interior walls. In such 
case, you could add several section 
planes within the ARCH containers to 
cut everything exactly as needed.
Section planes are separated by con-
tainers. In other words, a section plane 
within a group affects only the geom-
etry in that group. This means that you 
can have multiple active section planes 
per scene , as long as each active sec-
tion plane is in a separate container..
Figure 20.2  The section planes are placed in the  
CONC – Interior and CONC – Exterior containers of the 
ARCH – Walls container.
Figure 20.1  The horizontal section planes sit approximately 4' 
above the finished floor.

359
Chapter 20: Construction Documents
TIP  Keep in mind that you can reuse the same section plane for multiple plan views.
Vertical section planes are typically placed on the outside of the model, at the base level, 
because everything is cut at the same time for elevations and sections.
Stacking Viewports to Control Line Weights
The ability to completely control line weights in your drafting software is critical to any 
drafting workflow. To completely control line weights in LayOut, you will need to master the 
concept of stacking viewports.
Each plan drawing in your set of construction documents is composed of one or more 
viewports. Each viewport is linked to a plan scene within SketchUp. Each plan scene within 
SketchUp represents an array of line weights. This means that you will typically create one 
scene for “heavy” line weights (walls and floors) and one scene for “light” line weights (doors, 
windows, furniture, etc.).
To do this, you will need to actually stack the viewports in LayOut. Each viewport can 
have a line weight applied to it.
Each scene represented in LayOut 
has an array of line weights. (See the 
“Line Weight Theory” section in Chap-
ter 10, “The LayOut Interface.”) You 
apply a line weight to the viewport, 
and the style will translate that line 
weight into an array based on the pro-
file and section cut settings. Figure 20.3 
illustrates why it is best to assign line 
weights of .2 and .6. As you can see in 
the figure, these settings provide the 
largest array of line weights.
There is really no limit to the num-
ber of viewports you could stack; how-
ever, to keep your presentation and 
number of scenes manageable, two is 
usually enough, and three or more are 
necessary only if you need several dif-
ferent hatches.
Figure 20.3  An array of line weights

360
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
All viewports that compose a drawing belong on the DRAWINGS layer in LayOut. You 
could use layers to control the stacking order, but then you would have a lot more layers 
to manage in LayOut. An easier way to manage the stacking order is to send the viewport 
backward and forward. Use either the Arrange toolbar, or right-click on a viewport and select 
Arrange c Send Backward/Forward to manage the stacking order, or sublevels of the layer.
The suggested stacking order and rendering settings of viewports is as follows:
☑
☑Light line weight on top, rendered as a hybrid (.2 line weight)
☑
☑Heavy line weight below, rendered as a vector (.6 line weight)
☑
☑Any hatching on the very bottom, rendered as a vector (line weight n/a)
TIP  There is no need to insert the SketchUp model multiple times to create multiple stacked 
viewports. You can copy and paste the viewport right on top of the copied viewport. You 
can also use the Duplicate command available in the Edit drop-down menu to duplicate a 
selected viewport. Then hold down the Shift key and use the arrow keys to nudge the new 
viewport four times up and four times to the left so that it is once again aligned.
Hatching
Through the creative use of styles, or simply by drawing the hatch in LayOut, you can add 
hatching to your LayOut drawings. Each hatch method has its own limitations and requirements 
regarding efficiency and rendering settings. Before you incorporate hatching, explore all the 
options and then apply the best strategy for your particular design and set of drawings.
SketchUp Hatch
Using SketchUp to create the hatch provides a dynamically linked hatch in LayOut. This 
means that if you move a wall, the wall lines and hatch will update simultaneously in all the 
LayOut drawings. This method is ideal because it eliminates the need to redraw hatches as 
your design evolves.
A limitation to this method is that you can use only vector fills, and not the patterns or 
materials that most CAD users have come to expect. The good news is that if you are print-
ing in color, you can use color fills.
If you are printing in black and white, you can create a nice array of fills with grays 10 to 
25 percent apart. However, you will need to be selective with the amount of hatching you 
use in this way because each hatch requires its own viewport, which further complicates the 
stacking of viewports.

361
Chapter 20: Construction Documents
Create the Hatch – 50 (Figure 20.4) style now, and you can use it later when you create 
drawings composed of several stacked viewports. You can also create other hatch styles, such 
as HATCH – 25 and HATCH – 75 by adjusting the HLS lightness slider within the Style Edit tab.
Figure 20.4  The Hatch 50 style
LayOut Hatch
Another hatching method is to use the Drafting tools in LayOut to create a solid vector fill 
(Figure 20.5). To do that, activate any of the Drawing tools, set the fill to the desired “hatch 
color,” and turn off the stroke. Add LayOut shapes or lines with fill to define special hatched 
areas. Be sure to right-click on the fill and select Arrange c Send to Back so that the lines will 
be on top.
Figure 20.5  Use the Drawing tools in LayOut to create vector fills.

362
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
You could also use the fill you just cre-
ated as a clipping mask for a hatch image 
or a .skp hatch file. To do that, create a 
repeating pattern in an image editor or 
in SketchUp and use the fill as a clipping 
mask (Figure 20.6).
The major downside to creating 
hatches in LayOut is that there is no 
dynamic link between the hatch and the 
drawing. If you update the plan, you will 
need to be aware of any conflicts created 
with the hatching. The benefit of this 
method is that you will be able to add as 
much hatching as you like with any pat-
tern you need. Typically, this technique is 
best utilized for smaller areas of hatching.
TIP  Right-click on any hatch and 
choose Send to Back. All hatches 
sit at the bottom of the stack on the 
DRAWINGS layer.
Conceptual Layers
CONCEPTUAL layers are typically used as adjectives that explain the ARCH and SITE 
containers, but they can also help you achieve a desired look. As you saw in previous 
chapters, anything that does not render correctly in 3D can be corrected with a 2D graphic 
by using the CONC – 2D Graphic and CONC – 3D Object layers. In this section you will see 
how The CONC – Always Off and CONC – Details layers help you eliminate unneeded lines 
and excessive detail while maintaining model organization and efficiency.
CONC – Always Off
Because of the way SketchUp works as a surface modeler, there will be times when you 
don’t want to see an edge but you won’t be able delete it because it is needed to complete 
a surface. This often happens when containers meet—for example, at new and existing walls, 
between levels, and where exterior meets interior.
Figure 20.6  Draw repeating lines in SketchUp to 
create a hatch pattern fill to be used in LayOut.

363
Chapter 20: Construction Documents
One option that will solve this problem is to hide the edge, but hiding is more of a mod-
eling tool than a permanent fix. If you never want to see a specific entity, assign it to the 
CONC – Always Off layer, which is always turned off (Figure 20.7).
Figure 20.7  The CONC – Always Off layer allows you to show seamless transitions between 
containers.
Refer to the following images in Figure 20.7:
1.	 Notice that where the door was demolished and the new wall container meets the 
existing wall container, there are still lines. These lines need to remain in the model to 
make the surfaces, but they shouldn’t be seen.
2.	 Double-click all the way into the existing wall’s container and select the edges as 
shown. Assign them to the CONC – Always Off layer. The edges are not gone yet 
because they also exist in the new wall’s container.
3.	 Double-click all the way into the new wall’s container and select the edges as shown. 
Assign them to the CONC – Always Off layer.
4.	 The wall appears seamless now, as it should for perspective renderings and elevations.
5.	 Switch to the SCOPE utility scene, and note that both the new and existing function-
ality are maintained.
TIP  Remember the “All edges and surfaces are drawn on Layer0” rule discussed in 
Chapter 4, “SketchUp Basics”? The CONC – Always Off layer is the one exception to 
that rule, although this layer is not limited to edges.
CONC – Detail
The CONC – Details layer helps you increase or decrease the level of detail shown for an 
object. There are often details associated with 3D objects that don’t render properly in 
plan, so you need this layer “switch” to control the amount of detail shown. The entities 

364
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
placed on the CONC - Details layer are desirable in 3D views and elevations, but not in plan 
(Figure 20.8). Think of stair railings, door hardware, and window fenestrations (Figure 20.9).
Figure 20.8  Some details of 
objects and architectural fea-
tures do not render properly 
in plan, but are needed for a 
convincing elevation or 3D 
perspective view. Such entities 
belong on the CONC – Detail 
layer.
Figure 20.9  In this MOD, the 
stairs where the railings and 
main support are placed on the 
CONC – Detail layer. This will 
allow the stairs to render cor-
rectly when shown in plan.

Chapter 20: Construction Documents
Drawings
Every drawing is composed of a scene, or combination of several scenes with varying styles, 
all combined and carefully stacked within LayOut. The following instructions explain how to 
make many common drawings that are needed to describe a building.
Plans
Each plan drawing is created by stacking two or more viewports on top of each other. Use 
the scene organization diagrams (SODs) to create the necessary scenes in SketchUp. Next, 
assign the scenes to viewports in LayOut and stack the plans as shown to create each plan 
drawing. While you’re building these plans, keep in mind the following:
☑
☑All of the plans should share the same camera location, with the top-down view set to 
parallel projection.
☑
☑It is okay for several floorplan scenes to share the same section plane.
☑
☑Typically, the section plane for a plan should be approximately 4f off the finished floor.
☑
☑Each viewport will be set to a scale appropriate for the plan. Assume that all plans, eleva-
tions, and sections for the model will be set to 1/8g = 1f-0g, and enlarged plans will be 
set to 1/4g = 1f-0g.
TIP  This is a complicated process with a lot of steps represented by the Scene 
Organization Diagrams and Viewport Stacking Diagrams. Your first time through might 
be a little frustrating. Now would be a good time to visit www.suexch.com and watch 
the video tutorial on how to create these drawings, then use the book as a guide as 
you make the drawings yourself.
Existing Conditions Plan
The existing conditions plan represents the structure as it stands, before you make any 
changes (Figure 20.10). You will be using only the BIC_3458 Steele St – Existing 
Conditions.skp model for this drawing. This is the simplest plan drawing to create because 
it uses one model and only has two stacked viewports (Figure 20.11).
Demolition Plan
The demolition plan represents the pieces of the structure that will remain, as well as the 
pieces that will be removed (Figure 20.12). The demolition plan (Figure 20.13) utilizes the 
existing conditions model combined with the proposed conditions model.

366
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Figure 20.10  The SOD for the existing conditions plan
Figure 20.11  The stacked viewports of an existing conditions plan
Walls and entities to be removed are represented by dashed lines in this plan (Fig-
ure 20.14). To show the existing conditions dashed, you must first explode the existing condi-
tions viewports. Although this removes the dynamic link between the SketchUp model and 
the viewport, it is okay because, technically, the existing conditions model is complete and 
will never change.

Construction Plan
The construction plan describes what is to be built (Figure 20.15). New walls are delineated 
through the use of a hatch fill (Figure 20.16).

Chapter 20: Construction Documents
Finish Plan
The finish plan describes the materials that will be used to finish the space (Figure 20.17). You 
can use the standard LINE DRAWING style to create a black-and-white finish plan, or you 
can create a new LINE DRAWING style (Figure 20.18) that also shows colors and textures 
(Figure 20.19).

Reflected Ceiling Plan
A reflected ceiling plan describes what will be built on the ceiling of the space (Figure 20.20). 
Imagine looking down on a plan, through the ceiling, from above, and the floor is a mirror. 
What you would see is a reflected ceiling plan (Figure 20.21). This plan is very diagrammatic 
in nature, so creating it can be a little tricky.
Add the section plane above the window and door headers, but below the ceiling (Fig-
ure 20.22). Set the view from the bottom as a parallel projection, similar to a plan. Once you 
insert the drawing into LayOut, right-click on the viewport and choose Flip c Left to Right. 
This will make the reflected ceiling plan drawing read the same as the other plans.

372
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Enlarged Plans
Sometimes you need a bigger plan to 
further explain a complex space and 
make room for cramped annotations 
and dimensions. To create a bigger 
plan, use the same methods you used 
for creating any plan—just use a larger 
scale (Figure 20.23).
Sections and Elevations
Creating section drawings and 
elevation drawings is much easier in 
that they only require one viewport. 
The downside is that you’ll need to 
complete many of the graphics in 
LayOut. This will essentially break the 
dynamic link because you will need to 
update the LayOut geometry if you update the section drawing.
To learn how to create sections and elevations, you will use a more complex and devel-
oped model, BIC_3458 Steele St – FINAL.skp, that includes multiple levels. Typically, a 
section or elevation section plane will exist at the base level of the model, outside of any 
container.
Building Sections
Building sections describe the relationship between the levels of a structure, and they provide 
interior elevation information. Keep these other tips in mind when you create section 
drawings:
☑
☑Place the building section plane at the base level of the model (Figure 20.24).
☑
☑Right-click on a section plane and choose Align View to set the camera view perpen-
dicular to the section plane.
☑
☑Within SketchUp, right-click on a section plane and choose Create Group from Slice. 
Then, cut the group of linework and paste it into LayOut. Render it as a vector and 
explode. Now all of the linework for the section is readily available—but keep in mind, it 
is not dynamically linked to the section.
Figure 20.23  Using an enlarged plan makes 
dimensioning and annotating easier, and it still 
maintains the dynamic link.

373
Chapter 20: Construction Documents
☑
☑Use the Line Drawing style to create a black-and-white drawing, or use the LINE DRAW-
ING w/Textures style to create a color section.
☑
☑Use the Drawing tools in LayOut to create fills and accentuate the 2D SketchUp draw-
ings to give them more visual pop (Figure 20.25).
Figure 20.24  The Section plane location
Exterior Elevations
Exterior elevations convey materials and vertical heights. Elevations are possibly the simplest 
drawings to create because frequently they do not require any section planes and there is 
only one viewport. Keep the following tips in mind when you’re creating exterior elevations.
Figure 20.25  The building section drawing is a combination of 
a SketchUp viewport complemented with LayOut geometry

374
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
☑
☑Right-click on a surface on the elevation that you are creating and choose Align View 
to set the camera perpendicular to the selected face. This technique is especially helpful 
when aligning the camera view with an angled wall.
☑
☑In SketchUp, use section planes to peel away unwanted portions of the site.
☑
☑In SketchUp, use fog to provide a sense of depth.
☑
☑In LayOut, use a clipping mask to remove unwanted portions of the site (Figure 20.26).
☑
☑You can get trees from 3D trees in SketchUp or from the pre-loaded 2D tree scrapbook 
collections in LayOut.
☑
☑Use the LINE DRAWING w/Textures style to make a color elevation, depending on the 
type of project and printing you are doing.
TIP  Any LayOut entity that complements the drawing, such as a hatch or ground line, 
belongs on the DRAWINGS layer.
Figure 20.26  The Building Elevation clipping mask
Interior Elevations
Interior elevations are typically drawn at a larger scale than building sections, and they describe 
vertical dimensions and finishes. Keep the following tips in mind when you’re creating interior 
elevations.

375
Chapter 20: Construction Documents
☑
☑Start by using a building section  
scene in SketchUp, or even using  
an existing building section scene.
☑
☑Turn off layers and hide as 
much geometry as possible in 
SketchUp. LayOut will process all 
the geometry that is turned on, 
even if it is not shown in your 
viewport.
☑
☑Apply a clipping mask in LayOut 
to isolate the desired portion of 
the drawing (Figure 20.27).
☑
☑Use the Line Drawing style to 
create a black-and-white draw-
ing, or use the LINE DRAWING 
w/Textures style to create a color 
interior elevation.
☑
☑Use the Drawing tools in LayOut 
to create fills. This will give your 
drawing more pop.
Schedules
Schedules are used to convey the quantities you’ll need of products, such as doors, windows, 
and finishes (Figure 20.28). A schedule in LayOut is actually very simple, created mostly of 
text boxes with different fills, strokes, fonts, and text sizes (Figure 20.29). Keep the following 
tips in mind when you’re creating schedules in LayOut.
☑
☑There is no dynamic link to the entities you are scheduling, so make sure you count care-
fully. It is usually easier to catch schedule mistakes when the schedule and drawings are 
printed.
☑
☑Once you build a schedule, add it to a scrapbook collection for use on other projects.
☑
☑Use the Drawing tools in LayOut to complement complex schedules.

Chapter 20: Construction Documents
Details
A detail explains the finite construction of a specific 
building condition. When you’re creating details 
in any drafting program, there is a disconnect 
between the dynamically linked design model and 
the detail drawings. It would be nearly impossible 
to build a model with the level of detail and 
organization necessary to show all levels of detail at 
any architectural scale. Because of this, it is okay to 
“detach” your details from the design model.
Draft the details in 3D SketchUp just as you 
would in 2D CAD (Figure 20.30). Use SketchUp’s 
ground plane as your digital drafting table. Consider 
using a separate SketchUp model, or even a “throw-
away model,” when you’re creating details.
Once you have finished drafting the detail, 
select all of the lines, and then cut the lines out 
of SketchUp. Paste the lines into LayOut to insert 
them as a linked SketchUp model (Figure 20.31).
With the viewport still selected, use the SketchUp Model Inspector to set the viewport 
to Top View, Ortho, Vector Rendering, and choose an appropriate scale for a detail drawing, 
such as 1g = 1f-0g (Figure 20.32).
Figure 20.31  The pasted SketchUp lines 
are actually a .skp file linked to the LayOut 
presentation.
Figure 20.30  Using the Drawing and Modifica-
tion tools, draft the details in SketchUp.
Figure 20.32  The detail drawing is shown 
optimized in LayOut.

378
The SketchUp Workflow for Architecture
Explode the viewport so that you can con-
trol the line weights. Once it’s exploded, you 
will probably need to ungroup several LayOut 
groups. To do that, right-click on the group 
and select Ungroup. Then, use LayOut’s Draw-
ing and Modification tools in conjunction with 
the Shape Style Inspector to complete the 
detail drawing (Figure 20.33).
SketchUp is a 3D program, so there is no 
reason you shouldn’t branch out and create 
3D details. Often 3D details can do a better 
job explaining conditions than 2D can. As a 
starting point, try searching the 3D Warehouse 
for Construction Details (Figure 20.34).
TIP  Save all of your details in the 
Scrapbooks library so you can use them on 
other projects. Frequently,  a typical project 
type uses standardized details, and you can 
save a significant amount of time by building 
a collection of details.
Figure 20.34  3D details are available on the 3D Warehouse.
Figure 20.33  Use all of the tools available 
in LayOut to complete the detail drawing.

Chapter 20: Construction Documents
Annotations
Annotations are the extra layer of information that further describe the drawings. 
Annotations complement the graphic with accurate dimensions and precise descriptions. 
Keep these tips in mind when you annotate your drawings:
☑
☑Because it is difficult to draw accurate column lines in LayOut, draw them in SketchUp. 
Treat column lines as 2D Graphics that compliment a 3D object of a beam.
☑
☑Door and window center lines are drawn in LayOut
☑
☑Be sure to switch to the ANNOTATIONS layer, which should be active most of the time.
☑
☑It is okay to link your model to several different layout files to break up the set. This will 
reduce rendering time and allow you to distribute work among the team.
☑
☑When you’re dimensioning, typically it is best to turn off Auto Scale and set the Dimen-
sion Scale manually in the drop-down menu. This will eliminate potential errors from 
snapping to a point outside of a viewport.
☑
☑If you find yourself using the same annotation, take the time to add it to your 
scrapbooks.
Chapter Points
☑
☑Leverage conceptual layers to achieve a desired look and level of detail within  
your drawings.
☑
☑You can download professionally built title blocks and scrapbooks at www.suexch.com, 
as well as review extended content regarding the creation of construction documents 
with SketchUp Pro and LayOut. 
☑
☑Any drawing can be exploded to provide you with complete line-weight control in 
LayOut.
