About the Author
Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written nearly 50 popular com-
puter books, including Dr. Mac: The OS X Files and Mac OS 9 For Dummies for
Wiley Publishing, Inc.; Stupid Mac Tricks and Dr. Macintosh for Addison-Wesley;
and The Little iTunes Book, 3rd Edition and The Little iDVD Book, 2nd Edition
for Peachpit Press. His books have sold more than a million copies worldwide. 
Bob has penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the Houston Chronicle for
more than six years and has been published in dozens of computer maga-
zines over the past 15 years. His achievements have been documented in
major media around the world. (Yes, that was him juggling a keyboard in 
USA Today a few years back!) 
Bob is known for his expertise, trademark humorous style, and ability to trans-
late techie jargon into usable and fun advice for regular folks. Bob is also a pro-
lific public speaker, presenting more than 100 Macworld Expo training sessions
in the U.S. and abroad, keynote addresses in three countries, and Macintosh
training seminars in many U.S. cities. (He also won the Macworld Expo
MacJeopardy World Championship three times before retiring his crown.) 
Bob is considered one of the world’s leading authorities on Mac OS. From
1989 to 1997, he was a contributing editor/columnist for MacUser magazine,
writing the Help Folder, Beating the System, Personal Best, and Game Room
columns at various times. 
In 2004, LeVitus founded his most ambitious undertaking yet, Doctor Mac
Direct LLC (www.doctormacdirect.com), a company that provides expert techni-
cal help and training to Mac users, in real time and at reasonable prices, via
telephone, e-mail, and/or its own unique Internet-enabled remote control soft-
ware. If you’re having problems with your Mac, you ought to give them a try!
Prior to giving his life over to computers, LeVitus spent years at Kresser/
Craig/ D.I.K. (a Los Angeles advertising agency and marketing consultancy)
and its subsidiary, L & J Research. He holds a B.S. in Marketing from
California State University.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to my wife, Lisa, who taught me almost everything I
know about almost everything except computers.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Special thanks to everyone at Apple who helped me turn this book around in
record time: Keri Walker, Pam Bennett, Nathalie Welch, Greg (Joz) Joswiak,
and all the rest. I couldn’t have done it without you. 
Thanks also to super-agent Carole “Swifty-for-life” McClendon, for deal-
making beyond the call of duty, again. You’ve been my agent nearly 20 years,
and I want you to know that you’re a treasure.
Big-time thanks to the gang at Wiley: Bob “Is the damn thing done yet?”
Woerner, Nicole “Whipcrcker VI” Sholly, Andy “Big Boss Man” Cummings,
Barry “Still no humorous nickname” Pruett, technical editor Dennis R. Cohen,

And additional extra special thanks to Dennis R. Cohen for technical support
and for updating several chapters for me when time got short. It’s been an
honor and a privilege to work with the only guy I know who’s been using OS X
longer than me. You rock, dude!
Thanks also to my family and friends, for putting up with me during my all-
too lengthy absences during this book’s gestation. And thanks to Saccone’s

Introduction
Y
ou made the right choice twice: Mac OS X Tiger and this book.
Take a deep breath and get ready to have a rollicking good time. That’s right.
This is a computer book, but this is going to be fun. What a concept! Whether
you’re brand spanking new to the Mac or a grizzled old Mac vet, I guarantee
that discovering the ins and outs of Mac OS X Tiger will be fun and easy.
Wiley, Inc. (the publisher of this book) couldn’t say it on the cover if it
weren’t true!
About This Book
This book’s roots lie with my international bestseller Macintosh System 7.5
For Dummies, an award-winning book so good that now-deceased Mac cloner
Power Computing gave away a copy with every Mac clone they sold. Mac OS
X Tiger For Dummies is the latest revision and has been, once again, com-
pletely updated to include all the cool new features found in Mac OS X Tiger.
In other words, this edition combines all the old, familiar features of the pre-
vious books (Mac OS 7.6 For Dummies, Mac OS 8 For Dummies, Mac OS 8.5 For
Dummies, and Mac OS 9 For Dummies, plus the three previous editions of Mac
OS X For Dummies with cat names) — but once again expanded and updated
to reflect the latest and greatest offering from Apple.
Why write a For Dummies book about Tiger? Well, Tiger is a big, somewhat
complicated personal-computer operating system. So I made Mac OS X Tiger
For Dummies a not-so-big, not-very-complicated book that shows you what
Tiger is all about without boring you to tears, confusing you, or poking you
with sharp objects.
In fact, I think you’ll be so darned comfortable that I wanted the title to be
Mac OS X Tiger Without Discomfort, but the publishers wouldn’t let me.
Apparently we For Dummies authors have to follow some rules, and using
“Dummies” and “Mac OS X Tiger” in this book’s title are among them.
And speaking of “dummies,” remember that it’s just a word. I don’t think
you’re dumb — quite the opposite! My second choice for this book’s title was
Mac OS X Tiger For People Smart Enough to Know They Need Help with It, but
you can just imagine what Wiley thought of that. (“C’mon, that’s the whole
point of the name!” they insisted. “Besides, it’s shorter this way.”)

Anyway, the book is chock-full of information and advice, explaining every-
thing you need to know about Mac OS X in language you can understand —
along with timesaving tips, tricks, techniques, and step-by-step instructions,
all served up in generous quantities.
What You Won’t Find in this Book
Another rule we For Dummies authors must follow is that our book cannot
exceed a certain number of pages. (Brevity is the soul of wit, and all that.) So
there are some things I wish I could have included, but they didn’t fit.
Although I feel confident you’ll find everything you need to know about Mac
OS X Tiger in this book, some things bear further looking into, including
these:
 Information about many of the applications (programs) that come
with Mac OS X Tiger
An installation of Mac OS X Tiger includes more than 50 separate appli-
cations, mostly found in the Applications folder and the Utilities folder
within it. I’d love to walk you through each one of them, but that would
have required a book a whole lot bigger, heavier, and more expensive
than this one.
This book is, first and foremost, about using Mac OS X, so I brief you on
the small handful of bundled applications essential to using Mac OS X
Tiger and keep the focus there. Reserved for independent study else-
where are the iLife application suite (iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, iDVD, and
GarageBand), as well as other programs that aren’t essential to OS X
(such as Stickies, TextEdit, Chess, DigitalColorMeter, and the like).
Programs you need to know about to configure or use Mac OS X Tiger
(for example, System Preferences, Printer Setup Utility, Activity Monitor
and such) are covered in full and loving detail.
For what it’s worth, there are many books about the applications
included with Mac OS X Tiger; the two my publisher suggested I recom-
mend are Mac OS X Tiger All-in-One Desk Reference, written by Mark L.
Chambers, and iLife 04 All-in-One Desk Reference, written by Tony Bove
and Cheryl Rhodes, which are both (sheer coincidence) published 
by Wiley.
 Information about Microsoft Office, AppleWorks, Photoshop, Quicken,
and most other third-party applications
Okay, if all the gory details of all the bundled (read: free) Mac OS X Tiger
applications don’t fit here, I think you’ll understand why digging into
third-party applications that cost extra was out of the question.
2
Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies 

 Information about programming for the Mac
This book is about using Mac OS X Tiger, not writing code for it. There
are dozens of books about programming on the Mac, most of which are
two or three times the size of this book.
 My world-famous Mojito recipe
I make perhaps the finest Mojito you’ll ever find outside of Cuba, but my
editor insists it would be inappropriate to include it in this book (food
stains would make the text hard to read). So if you like a good Mojito,
send me an e-mail at MojitoExpert@doctormacdirect.com and I’ll
send you a Mojito recipe that will knock your socks off. (If you don’t
know what a Mojito is, here’s a chance to find out.)
Conventions Used in This Book
To get the most out of this book, you need to know how I do things and why.
Here are a few conventions used in this book to make your life easier:
 When I want you to open an item in a menu, I write something like
“Choose File➪Open,” which means, “Pull down the File menu and
choose the Open command.”
 Stuff you’re supposed to type appears in bold type, like this.
 Sometimes an entire a sentence is in bold, as you’ll see when I present
a numbered list of steps. In those cases, I debold what you’re supposed
to type, like this.
 Web addresses, programming code (not much in this book), and things
that appear onscreen are shown in a special monofont typeface, like
this.
 When I refer to the Ú menu, I’m referring to the menu in the upper-left
corner of the Finder menu bar that looks like a blue or graphite Apple
(called the Apple menu). For example, I may say, “From the Ú menu,
choose File➪Open.” I do not use the Ú symbol to refer to the key on
your Mac keyboard that may or may not have both the Ô and Ú sym-
bols on it. I refer to that key (called the Command key) with the equally
funky Ô symbol and write something like, “Press the Ô key.” So, when
you see Ú, think Apple menu.
 For keyboard shortcuts, I write something like Ô+A, which means to
hold down the Ô key (the one with the little pretzel and/or Ú symbol on
it) and then press the letter A on the keyboard. If you see something like
Ô+Shift+A, that means to hold down the Ô and Shift keys while pressing
the A key. Again, for absolute clarity, I never refer to the Ô key with the
Ú symbol. I reserve that symbol for the Ú menu (Apple menu). For the
Command key, I use only the Ô symbol. Got it? Very cool.

Introduction

What You’re Not to Read
The first few chapters of this book are where I describe the basic everyday
things that you need to understand in order to operate your Mac effectively.
Even though Mac OS X Tiger is way different from previous Mac operating
systems, this first part is so basic that if you’ve been using a Mac for long,
you may think you know it all — and you may know most of it. But hey! —
not-so-old-timers need a solid foundation. So here’s my advice: Skip through
the stuff you know; you’ll get to the better stuff faster.
Other stuff that you can skip over (if you’re so inclined) is any sidebar or sec-
tion marked with a Technical Stuff icon, which I talk about in a moment.
Foolish Assumptions
Although I know what happens when you make assumptions, I’ve made a few
anyway. First, I assume that you, gentle reader, know nothing about using
Mac OS X — beyond knowing what a Mac is, that you want to use OS X, that
you want to understand OS X without digesting an incomprehensible techni-
cal manual, and that you made the right choice by selecting this particular
book.
And so, I do my best to explain each new concept in full and loving detail.
Maybe that’s foolish, but . . . oh well.
Oh, and I also assume that you can read. If you can’t, ignore this paragraph.
How This Book Is Organized
Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies is divided into five logical parts, numbered (sur-
prisingly enough) 1 through 5. By no fault of mine, they’re numbered using
those stuffy old Roman numerals, so you’ll see I–V where you (in my humble
opinion) ought to see Arabic numbers 1–5. Another rule, I think.
Anyway, it’s better if you read the parts in order, but if you already know a 
lot — or think you know a lot — feel free to skip around and read the parts
that interest you most.

Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies 

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X
This first part is very, very basic training. From the mouse to the Desktop,
from menus, windows, and icons to the snazzy-but-helpful Dock, it’s all here.
A lot of what you need to know to navigate the depths of Mac OS X safely and
sanely will be found in this section. And although old-timers may just want to
skim through it, you newcomers should probably read every word. Twice.
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training
In this part, I build on the basics of Part I and really get you revving with your
Mac. Here I cover additional topics that every Mac user needs to know, cou-
pled with some hands-on, step-by-step instruction. It starts with a closer look
at the program you’ll be using most, the OS X Finder, followed by a chapter
about how to open and save files (a skill you’re sure to find handy). Next
comes a chapter about managing your files for maximum efficiency followed
by a quick look at using removable media (which means ejectable disks —
CDs, DVDs, and even oldies but goodies such as Zip drives). Last, but cer-
tainly not least, is a chapter about the importance of backing up your data —
and how to do it painlessly.
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac
This part is chock-full of ways to do cool stuff with your Mac. In this section,
you’ll discover the Internet first — how to get it working on your Mac, and
what to do with it after you do. Next, I show you the ins and outs of printing
under OS X. You also read about some of the more important OS X-related
applications and features, plus how to make your Tiger look and feel just the
way you like it. That’s all followed by the lowdown on the Classic Environment,
and possibly the most useful chapter in the whole book, Chapter 13, which
details each and every gosh-darned System Preference, filled with useful obser-
vations and recommendations.
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting
Here I get into the nitty-gritty underbelly of Mac OS X, where I cover some-
what more advanced topics, such as file sharing, creating and using multiple
users (and why you might want to), and the all-important troubleshooting
chapter, Chapter 15.

Introduction

Part V: The Part of Tens
Finally, it’s The Part of Tens, which may have started life as a Letterman rip-
off, although it does include heaping helpings of tips, optional software, great
Mac Web sites, and hardware ideas.
The Appendix
Last, but certainly not least, I cover installing Mac OS X Tiger in the Appendix.
The whole process has become quite easy with this version of the system soft-
ware, but if you have to install Tiger yourself, it would behoove you to read
this helpful Appendix first.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see little round pictures (icons) off to the left side of the text through-
out this book. Consider these icons as miniature road signs, telling you a little
something extra about the topic at hand. Here’s what the different icons look
like and what they all mean.
Look for Tip icons to find the juiciest morsels: shortcuts, tips, and undocu-
mented secrets about Tiger. Try them all; impress your friends!
When you see this icon, it means that this particular morsel is something that
I think you should memorize (or at least write on your shirt cuff).
Put on your propeller-beanie hat and pocket protector; these parts include
the truly geeky stuff. It’s certainly not required reading, but it must be inter-
esting or informative or I wouldn’t have wasted your time with it.
Read these notes very, very, very carefully. (Did I say very?) Warning icons
flag important information. The author and publisher won’t be responsible if
your Mac explodes or spews flaming parts because you ignored a Warning
icon. Just kidding. Macs don’t explode or spew (with the exception of a few
choice PowerBook 5300s, which won’t run Tiger anyway). But I got your
attention, didn’t I? I’ll tell you once again: It is a good idea to read the
Warning notes very carefully.

Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies 

These icons represent my ranting or raving about something that just bugs
me. Imagine foam coming from my mouth. Rants are required to be irreverent,
irrelevant, or both. I try to keep them short, more for your sake than mine.
Well, now, what could this icon possibly be about? Named by famous editor-
ial consultant Mr. Obvious, this icon highlights all things new and different in
Mac OS X Tiger.

In this part . . .
M
ac OS X Tiger sports tons of new goodies and fea-
tures. I’ll get to the hot new goodies soon enough,
but the standard approach is crawl first, we walk later.
In this part, you discover the most basic of basics, such as
how to turn on your Mac. Next, I acquaint you with the Mac
OS X Desktop: windows, icons, menus, and the Dock — you
know, the whole shmear. To finish things up, I describe
each and every OS X menu in full and loving detail. (Yum.)
So get comfortable, roll up your sleeves, fire up your Mac
if you like, and settle down with Part I, a delightful little
section I like to think of as “The Hassle-Free Way to Get
Started with Mac OS X Tiger.”

In This Chapter
 Defining Mac OS X Tiger
 Finding help if you’re a beginner
 Turning on your Mac
 Shutting down your Mac without getting chewed out by it
 Knowing what you should see when you turn on your Mac
 Taking a refresher course on using a mouse
 Touring the Desktop
 Sniffing out the default Desktop icons
 Beautifying your Desktop
C
ongratulate yourself on choosing Mac OS X, which stands for Macintosh
Operating System X — that’s the Roman numeral ten, not the letter X
(pronounced ten, not ex). You made a smart move because you scored more
than just an operating system upgrade. Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger includes
dozens of new or improved features to make using your Mac easier as well as
dozens more that help you do more work in less time. Now you can use these
new features to be more productive, have fewer headaches, reduce your cho-
lesterol level, and fall in love with your Mac all over again.
In this chapter, I start at the very beginning and talk about Mac OS X in
mostly abstract terms. After the basics are out of the way, I get right down to
the real nitty-gritty about the Mac OS X Desktop — the place where you start
doing stuff with your Mac.
Those of you who’ve been using Mac OS X for a while may find some of the
information in this chapter hauntingly familiar; some features that I describe
haven’t changed from earlier versions of Mac OS X.
Besides, if you decide to skip this chapter — just because you think you have
all the new stuff figured out — I assure you that you’ll miss out on sarcasm,

clever wordplay, shortcuts, awesome techniques, a bad pun or two, and
some good advice on making the Desktop an easier place to be. If that’s not
enough to convince you, I also provide a bunch of stuff that Apple didn’t
bother to tell you (as if you read every word in Mac OS X Help, which is the
only user manual Apple provides anyway!).
Those of you who are about to upgrade to Mac OS X Tiger from an earlier ver-
sion of Mac OS — in particular, Mac OS 9 or a previous Mac OS X release such
as Panther or Jaguar — should read the Appendix right about now. It con-
tains important information about installing Tiger that can make upgrading a
more pleasant experience.
If you are about to upgrade to Tiger, I feel obliged to mention a major pitfall
to avoid: One very specific misplaced click in the wrong place, done while
installing your new OS, could erase every file on your hard drive. The
Appendix describes it. So if you aren’t running Tiger yet, I urge you to read
the Appendix before you install — it could save your bacon.
To sum things up: This chapter contains some important information that
you need to know in order to use Mac OS X Tiger successfully. If you’re a total
beginner to the Mac experience, you should probably read every word in this
chapter. Even if you’re past the beginner stage, you may want to skim these
sections anyway to refresh your memory.
Tantalized? Let’s rock.
Gnawing to the Core of OS X
Along with the code in its read-only memory (ROM), the operating system
(that is, the OS in Mac OS X) is what makes a Mac a Mac. Without it, your Mac
is a pile of silicon and circuits — no smarter than a toaster.
“So what does an operating system do?” you ask. Good question. The short
answer is that an operating system controls the basic and most important
functions of your computer. In the case of Mac OS X and your Mac, the oper-
ating system
 Manages memory.
 Controls how windows, icons, and menus work.
 Keeps track of files.
 Manages networking.
 Does housekeeping. (No kidding!)
Other forms of software, such as word processors and Web browsers, rely on
the operating system to create and maintain the environment in which that
12
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

software works its magic. When you create a memo, for example, the word
processor provides the tools for you to type and format the information. In
the background, the operating system is the muscle for the word processor,
performing crucial functions such as the following:
 Providing the mechanism for drawing and moving the on-screen window
in which you write the memo
 Keeping track of a file when you save it
 Helping the word processor create drop-down menus and dialogs for
you to interact with
 Communicating with other programs
 And much, much more (stuff that only geeks could care about)
So, armed with a little background in operating systems, take a gander at the
next section before you do anything else with your Mac.
Don’t let that UNIX stuff scare you. It’s there if you want it, but if you don’t
want it or don’t care (like most of us), you’ll rarely even know it’s there. All
you’ll know is that your Mac just runs and runs and runs without crashing
and crashing and crashing.
One last thing: As I mention in the Introduction (I’m only repeating it for
those of you who don’t read Introductions), Mac OS X Tiger comes with more
than 50 applications. And although I’d love to tell you all about each and
every one, I can only tell you about the small handful of bundled applications
13
Chapter 1: Mac OS X Tiger 101 (Prerequisites: None)
The Mac advantage
Most of the world’s PCs use Windows. You’re
among the lucky few to have a computer with
an operating system that’s intuitive, easy to use,
and (dare I say) fun. If you don’t believe me, try
using Windows for a day or two. Go ahead. You
probably won’t suffer any permanent damage.
In fact, you’ll really begin to appreciate how
good you have it. Feel free to hug your Mac. Or
give it a peck on the CD-ROM drive slot — just
try not to get your tongue caught.
As someone once told me, “Claiming that the
Macintosh is inferior to Windows because
most people use Windows is like saying that all
other restaurants serve food that’s inferior to
McDonald’s.”
We may be a minority, but we have the best, 
most stable, most modern all-purpose operating
system in the world, and here’s why: UNIX — on
which Mac OS X is based — is widely regarded
as the best industrial-strength operating system.
For now, just know that being based on UNIX
means that a Mac running OS X will crash less
often than an older Mac or a Windows machine,
which means less downtime. But perhaps the
biggest advantage OS X has is that when an
application crashes, it doesn’t crash your entire
computer, and you don’t have to restart the thing
to continue working.

essential to using Mac OS X Tiger. If you need more info on the programs I
don’t cover, may I (again) recommend Mac OS X Tiger All-in-One Desk
Reference For Dummies, written by Mark L. Chambers, or iLife ‘04 All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies, written by my old friends Tony Bove and Cheryl
Rhodes (both from Wiley).
A Safety Net for the Absolute 
Beginner (Or Any User)
In this section, I deal with the stuff that the manual that came with your Mac
doesn’t cover — or doesn’t cover in nearly enough detail. If you’re a first-time
Macintosh user, please, please read this section of the book carefully — it
could save your life. Okay, okay, perhaps I’m being overly dramatic. What I
mean to say is that reading this section could save your Mac. Even if you’re
an experienced Mac user, you may want to read this section anyway. Chances
are you’ll see at least a few things you may have forgotten (and that may
come in handy).
Turning the dang thing on
Okay. This is the big moment — turning on your Mac! Gaze at it longingly first
and say something cheesy, such as “You’re the most awesome computer I’ve
ever known.” If that doesn’t turn on your Mac (and it probably won’t), keep
reading.
Apple, in its infinite wisdom, has manufactured Macs with power switches
and buttons on every conceivable surface: on the front, side, and back of the
computer itself, and even on the keyboard or monitor. So if you don’t know
how to turn on your Mac, don’t feel bad — just look in the manual or booklet
that came with your Mac. 
Some Macs (including most older PowerBooks) even hide the power button
behind a little plastic door. Because of the vast number of different configura-
tions, I can’t tell you where the switch is without devoting a whole chapter
just to that topic. (Can you say b-o-o-r-r-ring?)
These days some Macs have a power-on button on the keyboard; if so, it usu-
ally looks like the little circle thingie you see in the margin.
Don’t bother choosing Help➪Mac Help, which opens the Help Viewer pro-
gram because it can’t tell you where the switch is either. Although the Help
program is good for learning a lot of things, the location of the power switch
isn’t among them. Of course, if you haven’t found the switch and turned on
the Mac, you can’t access Help anyway. (D’oh!)
14
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

What you should see on startup
When you finally do turn on your Macintosh, you set in motion a sophisticated
and complex series of events that culminates in the loading of Mac OS X and
the appearance of the Mac OS X Desktop. After a small bit of whirring, buzzing,
and flashing (meaning that the operating system is loading), OS X first tests all
your hardware — slots, ports, disks, random-access memory (RAM) — and so
on. If everything passes, you hear a pleasing musical tone and see the tasteful
gray Apple logo in the middle of your screen, along with a small spinning-
pinwheel cursor somewhere on the screen. Both are shown in Figure 1-1.
 Everything is fine and dandy: Next, you see the soothing graphite Apple
logo, the words Mac OS X, and a status indicator with messages that tell
you the Mac is going through its normal startup motions. Makes you feel
kind of warm and fuzzy, doesn’t it? If all this fanfare shows up on-screen,
Mac OS X is loading properly. In the unlikely event that you don’t see the
gray Apple logo, the soothing messages, and/or the familiar Desktop, see
Chapter 15 (where I show you how to troubleshoot your system).
Next, you may or may not see the Mac OS X login screen, where you
enter your name and password. If you do, press the Enter or Return key
(after you type your name and password, of course) and away you go.
If you don’t want to have to type your name and password every time
you start or restart your Mac (or even if you do), check out Chapter 13
for the scoop on how to turn the login screen on or off.
Either way, the Desktop soon materializes before your eyes. If you
haven’t customized, configured, or tinkered with your Desktop, it should
look something like Figure 1-2. Now is a good time to take a moment for
positive thoughts about the person who convinced you that you wanted
a Mac. That person was right!

 Sad Mac: If any of your hardware fails when it’s tested, you could see a
black or gray screen that may or may not display the dreaded Sad Mac
icon (shown in the left margin) and/or hear a far less pleasing musical
chord (in the key of F-minor, I believe), known by Mac aficionados as the
Chimes of Doom.
Some older Macs played the sound of a horrible car wreck instead of the
chimes, complete with crying tires and busting glass. It was exception-
ally unnerving, which may be why Apple doesn’t use it anymore.
The fact that something went wrong is no reflection on your prowess as
a Macintosh user. Something inside your Mac is broken, and it probably
needs to go in for repairs (usually to an Apple dealer). If any of that’s
already happened to you, check out Chapter 16 to try to get your Mac
well again.
If your computer is under warranty, dial 1-800-SOS-APPL, and a customer-
service person can tell you what to do. Before you do anything, though,
skip ahead to Chapter 15. It’s entirely possible that one of the sugges-
tions there can get you back on track without you having to spend even
a moment on hold.
 Prohibitory sign (formerly known as the flashing-question-mark disk):
Although it’s unlikely that you’ll ever see the sad Mac, most users even-
tually encounter the prohibitory sign shown in the left margin (which
replaced the flashing question-mark-on-a-disk icon and flashing folder

icon back in OS X 10.2 Jaguar). This icon means your Mac can’t find a
startup disk, hard drive, network server, or CD-ROM containing a valid
Macintosh operating system. See Chapter 15 for ways you can try to
ease your Mac’s ills.
How do you know which version of the Mac OS your computer has? Simple.
Just choose About This Mac from the Ú menu (that’s the menu with the Ú
symbol in the upper-left corner of the Finder menu bar). The About This Mac
window pops up on your screen, as shown in Figure 1-3. The version you’re
running appears just below Mac OS X in the center of the window. Click the
More Info button to launch the System Profiler application, which has much
more information, including processor speed, bus speed, number of proces-
sors, caches, installed memory, networking, storage devices, and much more.
You can find more about this useful program in Chapter 11.

The legend of the boot
Boot this. Boot that. “I booted my Mac and. . . .”
or “Did it boot?” and so on. Talking about com-
puters for long without hearing the boot word is
nearly impossible.
But why boot? Why not shoe or shirt or even
shazam?
Back in the very olden days — maybe the 1960s
or a little earlier — starting up a computer
required you to toggle little manual switches on
the front panel, which began an internal
process that loaded the operating system. The
process became known as bootstrapping
because if you toggled the right switches, the
computer would “pull itself up by its boot-
straps.” This phrase didn’t take long to trans-
mogrify into booting and finally to boot.
Over the years, booting has come to mean turn-
ing on almost any computer or even a periph-
eral device, such as a printer. Some people also
use it to refer to launching an application: “I
booted Excel.”
So the next time one of your gearhead friends
says the b-word, ask whether he knows where
the term comes from. Then dazzle him with the
depth and breadth of your (not-quite-useful)
knowledge!

Shutting down properly
Turning off the power without shutting down your Mac properly is one of the
worst things you can do to your poor Mac. Shutting down your Mac improp-
erly can really screw up your hard drive, scramble the contents of your most
important files, or both.
If a thunderstorm is rumbling nearby or if you’re unfortunate enough to have
rolling blackouts where you live, you may really want to shut down your Mac.
(See the next section where I briefly discuss lightning and your Mac.)
To turn off your Mac, always use the Shut Down command on the Ú menu
(which I discuss in Chapter 3), or you can shut down in one of these kind-
and-gentle ways:
 Press the Power key once and then click the Shut Down button.
 On Apple Pro keyboards, which don’t have a Power key, press
Control+Eject instead, and then click the Shut Down button that appears
(or press the Return key, which does the same thing).
Of course, most of us have broken this rule several times without anything
horrible happening — but don’t be lulled into a false sense of security. Break
the rules one time too many (or under the wrong circumstances), and your
most important file will be toast. The only times you should turn off your Mac
without shutting down properly is if your screen is frozen or if you crash and
you’ve already tried everything else. (See Chapter 15 for what those “every-
thing elses” are.) A really stubborn crash doesn’t happen often — and less
often under OS X than ever before — but when it does, turning your Mac off

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger
Eternally yours . . . now
Mac OS X is designed so you never have to shut
it down. You can configure it to sleep after a spec-
ified period of inactivity. (See Chapter 13 for more
info on the Energy Saver features of OS X.) If you
do so, your Mac will consume very little electric-
ity when it’s sleeping and will be ready to use just
a few seconds after you awaken it (by pressing
any key or clicking the mouse). On the other hand,
if you’re not going to be using it for a few days,
you may want to shut it down anyway.
Note: If you leave your Mac on constantly and
you’re gone when a lightning storm or rolling
blackout hits, your Mac may get wasted. So be
sure you have adequate protection (say, a decent
surge protector designed specifically for com-
puters) if you decide to leave your Mac on and
unattended for long periods. See the section “A
few things you should definitely NOT do with your
Mac” (elsewhere in this chapter) for more info on
lightning and your Mac. Frankly, if I plan to be
away from mine for more than a day, I usually
shut it down, just in case. But because OS X is
designed to run 24/7, I don’t shut it down at night
unless it’s dark and stormy.

and then back on may be the only solution. Sometimes even that doesn’t
work, and you may have to unplug the computer from the power outlet, wait
a moment or two, and then plug it back in to get it to reboot.
A few things you should definitely 
NOT do with your Mac
In this section, I deal with the bad stuff that can happen to your computer if you
do the wrong things with it. If something bad has already happened to you — 
I know . . . I’m beginning to sound like a broken record — see Chapter 15.
 Don’t unplug your Mac when it’s turned on. Very bad things can
happen, such as having your operating system break. See the preceding
section, where I discuss shutting your system down properly.
 Don’t use your Mac when lightning is near. Here’s a simple life equa-
tion for you: Mac + lightning = dead Mac. ’Nuff said. Oh, and don’t place
much faith in inexpensive surge protectors. A good jolt of lightning will
fry the surge protector right along with your computer — as well as pos-
sibly frying your modem, printer, and anything else plugged into it. Some
surge protectors can withstand most lightning strikes, but these war-
riors aren’t the cheapies that you buy at your local computer emporium.
Unplugging your Mac from the wall during electrical storms is safer and
less expensive. (Don’t forget to unplug your external modem, network
hubs, printers, or other hardware that plugs into the wall as well — light-
ning can fry them, too.)
 Don’t jostle, bump, shake, kick, throw, dribble, or punt your Mac,
especially while it’s running. Your Mac contains a hard drive that spins
at 4,200+ revolutions per minute (rpm) or more. A jolt to a hard drive
while it’s reading or writing a file can cause the head to crash into the
disk, which can render many (or all) files on it unrecoverable. Ouch!
 Don’t forget to back up your data! I beg you: Please read Chapter 8 now
before something horrible happens to your valuable data! If the stuff on
your hard drive means anything to you, you must back it up. Not maybe.
You must. Even if your most important file is your last saved game of
Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, you still need to realize how important it is to
back up your files.
In Chapter 8, I discuss how to back up your files, and I strongly recom-
mend that you read Chapter 8 sooner rather than later — preferably
before you do any significant work on your Mac. Dr. Macintosh sez:
“There are only two kinds of Mac users: Those who have never lost data
and those who will.” Which kind will you be?
 Don’t kiss your monitor while wearing stuff on your lips. For obvious
reasons! Use a soft cloth and/or the Klear Screen polish and wipes that
Apple recommends if you need to clean your display.

Chapter 1: Mac OS X Tiger 101 (Prerequisites: None)

Point-and-click boot camp
Are you new to the Mac? Just learning how to move the mouse around? Now
is a good time to go over some fundamental stuff that you need to know for
just about everything you’ll be doing on the Mac. Spend a few minutes read-
ing this section, and soon you’ll be clicking, double-clicking, pressing, and
pointing all over the place. If you think you’ve got the whole mousing thing
pretty much figured out, feel free to skip this section. I’ll catch you on the
other side.
Still with me? Good. Now for some basic terminology.
 Point: Before you can click or press anything, you have to point to it.
Place your hand on your mouse and move it so that the cursor arrow is
over the object you want — like on top of an icon or a button. Then click
the mouse to select the object or double-click it to run it (if it’s an appli-
cation or an icon that starts up an application). You point and then you
click — point-and-click, in computer lingo.
 Click: (Also called single-click.) Use your index finger to push the mouse
button all the way down and then let go so it produces a satisfying click-
ing sound. (If you have one of the new optical Apple Pro mice, you push
down the whole thing to click.) Use a single-click to highlight an icon,
press a button, or activate a check box or window.
 Double-click: Click twice in rapid succession. With a little practice, you
can perfect this technique in no time. Use a double-click to open a folder
or to launch a file or application.
 Control-click: Hold down the Control key while single-clicking. Control-
clicking is the same as right-clicking on a Windows system and dis-
plays a menu (called a contextual menu) where you Control-clicked. In
fact, if you are blessed with a two-or-more-button mouse (I personally
use the four-button Kensington Expert Mouse Pro Trackball, and rec-
ommend it highly), you can right-click and avoid having to hold down
the Control key.
 Drag: Dragging something usually means you have to click it first and
hold the mouse button down. Then you move the mouse on your desk
or mouse pad so the cursor — and whatever you select — moves across
the screen. The combination of holding down the button and dragging
the mouse it is usually referred to as click-and-drag.
 Press: A press is half a click. Instead of letting go of the mouse button to
finish the click, keep holding it down. In most cases, your next step is to
drag the mouse somewhere — say, down a menu to choose a command,
or across the screen to move an object.
 Choosing an item from a menu: To get to Mac OS menu commands, you
must first open a menu and then pick the option you want. Point at the
name of the menu you want with your mouse cursor, press your mouse
20
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

button down, and then drag your mouse downward until you select the
command you want. When the command is highlighted, finish selecting
by letting go of the mouse button.
If you’re a long-time Mac user, you probably hold down the mouse button the
whole time between clicking the name of the menu and selecting the com-
mand you want. You can still do it that way, but you can also click once on
the menu name to open it, release the mouse button, and then drag down to
the item you want to select and then click again. In other words, OS X menus
stay open for a few seconds after you click them, even if you’re not holding
down the mouse button. Go ahead and give it a try . . . I’ll wait.
Touring the Desktop
Just about everything you do on your Mac begins and ends with the Desktop.
This is where you manage files, store documents, launch programs, adjust
the way your Mac works, and much more. If you ever expect to master your
Mac, the first step is to master the Desktop.
Some folks use the terms Desktop and Finder interchangeably to refer to the
total Macintosh environment you see — icons, windows, menus, and all that
other cool stuff. Just to make things confusing, the background you see on
your screen — the backdrop behind your hard drive icon and open windows —
is also called the Desktop. In this book, I refer to the Finder as the Finder, which
I discuss in Chapters 4 and 5. When I say Desktop, I’m talking about the back-
ground behind your windows and Dock.
Got it? The Desktop is convenient and fast. Put stuff there.
Check out the default Mac Desktop for OS X in Figure 1-4.
The Desktop is the center of your Mac OS experience, so before I go any far-
ther, here’s a quick description of its most prominent features:
 Desktop: The Desktop is the area behind the windows and the Dock,
where your hard drive icon (ordinarily) lives. The Desktop isn’t a window,
yet it acts like one. Like a folder window or drive window, the Desktop can
contain icons. But unlike most windows, which require a bit of navigation
to get to, the Desktop is a great place for things you use a lot, such as fold-
ers, applications, or particular documents. The next section discusses the
default icons you see on the Desktop when you first load up OS X.
 Dock: The Dock is the Finder’s main navigation shortcut tool. It makes
getting to frequently used icons easy, even when you have a screen full
of windows. Like the Desktop, the Dock is a great place for things you
use a lot, such as folders, applications, or particular documents. Besides
putting your frequently used icons at your fingertips, it’s almost infi-
nitely customizable, too; read more about it in Chapter 2.
21
Chapter 1: Mac OS X Tiger 101 (Prerequisites: None)

If you used an earlier version of Mac OS, think of the Dock as the OS X
version of the Apple menu in Mac OS versions of the past. Yes, the OS X
Finder does have an Apple menu, but it doesn’t work at all like the Apple
menu in earlier versions of Mac OS. See Chapter 3 for more info on the
Apple menu.
 Icons: Icons are the little pictures you see in your windows and even on
your Desktop. Most icons are containers that hold things you work with
on your Mac, such as programs and documents, which are also repre-
sented by — you guessed it — icons. In Chapter 2, I cover icons in detail,
and the next section discusses the icons you see on the OS X Desktop
when you first boot up your Mac.
 Aliases: Use aliases of things that you use often so you can keep the
originals tucked away in one of your perfectly organized folders. Check
out aliases in Chapter 2.
 Windows: Opening most icons (by double-clicking them) makes a
window appear. Windows in the Finder show you the contents of hard
drive and folder icons, and windows in applications usually show you

the contents of your documents. For the full scoop on Tiger windows,
which are very different from Mac windows in previous OS releases,
check out Chapter 3.
 Menus: Menus let you choose to do things, such as create new folders;
duplicate files; cut, copy, or paste text; and so on. Find out all about
them in Chapter 3.
If all these new terms such as alias, Dock, and so on seem strange to
you, don’t worry — I explain them all in detail in the rest of Part I.
Sniffing Out the Default Desktop Icons
Icons on the Desktop behave the same as icons in a window. You move them
and copy them just like you would an icon in a window. The only difference is
that Desktop items aren’t in a window: They’re on the Desktop, which makes
them more convenient to use.
Actually, if you look at your Home directory (click the Home button on any
Finder window toolbar or use the shortcut Ô+Shift+H to open a window dis-
playing Home), you see a folder named Desktop, which contains the same
icons you place on the Desktop (but not the hard-drive icons). The reason for
this folder is that each user has an individual Desktop. But I’m getting ahead
of myself. You find out much more about Home, users, and all that jazz in
upcoming chapters.
To move an item to the Desktop, simply click its icon in any window and
then, without releasing the mouse button, drag it out of the window and onto
the Desktop; then release the mouse button. If you don’t see a disk icon on
your Desktop, skip ahead to Chapter 3, where I discuss Finder Preferences.
That’s where you can choose whether to see disks on your Desktop.
 Hard drive icons: The first icon you should get to know is the icon for
your hard drive (refer to Figure 1-4). You can usually find it on the upper-
right side of the desktop when you first start the Mac. Look for the name
Macintosh HD, iMac HD, or something like that, unless you’ve already
renamed it. (I renamed my hard drive TigerDisk in Figure 1-5.)
There are two ways to rename your hard drive:
• Single-click the icon’s name. When the name highlights (as
shown in the middle icon in Figure 1-5), type its new name.
If you click directly on the icon instead of its name, the icon will be
selected but the name won’t become highlighted for editing, as shown in
the icon on the right in Figure 1-5.
or
• Single-click the icon itself, press Return or Enter, and then type
in a new name for the drive.
23
Chapter 1: Mac OS X Tiger 101 (Prerequisites: None)

 Disk icons: These appear on the Desktop by default. When you insert a
CD or DVD, its icon appears on the Desktop just below your hard-drive
icon (space permitting).
Picture This: A Picture on Your Desktop
I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that you can change the background picture
of your Desktop.
In Figure 1-6, you can see my Desktop with a background picture I made to
celebrate the release of the book before this one, GarageBand For Dummies
(Wiley). If you want a reminder of what the default Desktop background looks
like, refer to Figure 1-4.
Here’s how you can change your Desktop picture if you care to:
1. From the Desktop, choose Ú➪System Preferences or click the System
Preferences icon in the Dock.
The System Preferences window appears.
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
The Desktop & Screen Saver Preferences pane appears as shown in
Figure 1-7.
3. Click on any picture in your Home/Pictures folder.
I’m clicking a picture called drmacandbandtxt in Figure 1-7. You can see
it’s one of the items in my Home/Pictures folder, which is also shown in
Figure 1-7.

There are at least two other ways to change your Desktop picture:
 Drag a picture file from the Finder onto the picture well (the little rectan-
gular picture to the left of the picture’s name (drmacandbandtxt in
Figure 1-7).
or
 Select the Choose Folder item in the list of folders on the left side of the
Desktop & Screen Saver System Preference pane and then select a folder
using the standard Open File dialog. That folder then appears in the list;
you can use any picture files it contains for your Desktop picture.
If you don’t know how to choose a folder that way, look in Chapter 5. And for
more info on using System Preferences, check out Chapter 13.

n this chapter, I start with the Dock — a special, always-running application
that displays icons for quick access to frequently used applications, folders,
and even disks. (Dock icons are also a quick way to bring a hidden window or
application to the front so you can work with it again.) I also show you how to
customize your Dock so it works and looks just the way you want it to.
Then we delve deeper into icons, which are a fundamental part of what makes
a Mac a Mac. I may have said a word or two about icons already, but this time
I’m giving you the real nitty-gritty — everything you need to know about all
the icons you’ll encounter while using Mac OS X Tiger.
What You Get (In a Stock Dock)
Take a minute to look at the row of icons at the bottom of your display. 
That row, ladies and gentlemen, is the Dock (shown in Figure 2-1), and those
individual pictures are known as icons (which I will discuss in greater detail
momentarily).
Dock icons are odd ducks — they’re activated with a single-click. You’ll find
that most other icons are selected (highlighted) when you single click, and
opened when you double-click. So Dock icons are kind of like links on a Web
page — you only need a single click to open them. 

A quick introduction to using the Dock
Single-click a Dock icon to open the item it represents. If the item is an appli-
cation, the application will open and become active; if the item is a document,
that document will open in its appropriate application, which will become the
active application; if it’s a folder icon, the folder will open and the Finder will
become the active application. If the item is open already when you click its
Dock icon, it becomes active.
You can tell whether an application is open (running) by looking for the small
triangle beneath its Dock icon; you can see one under the Finder icon at the
far left in Figure 2-1.
When you press (click but don’t let go) Dock icons, a menu appears, as
shown in Figures 2-2 and 2-3.

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

In addition to useful program-specific commands (as you see in the iTunes
Dock menu in Figure 2-2), Dock menus for applications that have multiple
windows offer a list of windows in their menus, as shown in Figure 2-4. 
Figure 2-4:

29
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

Control-clicking a Dock icon gives you the same result as press-and-hold. The
cool part is that the menu pops up immediately when you Control-click.
The default icons of the Dock
By default, the Dock contains a number of commonly used Mac OS X appli-
cations, and you can also store your own applications, files, or folders there. 
(I show you how to do that in the “Adding an icon to the Dock” section later
in this chapter.)
But first, look at the items you find on a stock OS X Tiger Dock. If they aren’t
familiar to you, they certainly will be as you get to know Mac OS X.
In the Introduction to this book, I said I couldn’t do justice to all the programs
that come with Mac OS X Tiger that aren’t, strictly speaking, part of the oper-
ating system. Alas, some of the programs in the default Dock are ones we
won’t be seeing much more of. But I’d hate to leave you wondering what all
those icons in the Dock are, so Table 2-1 gives you a brief description of each
stock Dock icon (moving from left to right on-screen). If there is additional
coverage of an item elsewhere in the book, the table tells you where.

application that you open. 
Instead, you drag files and 
folders onto this icon to get rid 
of them, or drag removable 
discs onto it to eject them.
If you bought a new Mac with Tiger pre-installed, you may or may not see
icons for the iLife applications — iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto, and GarageBand — in
your Dock. It was unclear at press time if EVERY new Mac shipped with Tiger
on it was going to also include the iLife suite.
Don’t want it? Trash it
The Trash icon is unique among Dock items: It’s not a file or application that
you open. Instead, you drag things to this icon to get rid of them.
The Trash is a special container where you put the icons that you no longer
want on your hard drive or removable media storage device (such as Zip or
floppy disk). Got four copies of TextEdit on your hard drive? Drag three of
31
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

them to the Trash. Tired of tripping over old letters that you don’t want to
keep? Drag them to the Trash, too. To put something in the Trash, just drag
its icon on top of the Trash icon and watch it disappear.
Like other icons, you know that you’ve connected with the Trash while drag-
ging when the icon is highlighted. And like other Dock icons, the Trash icon’s
name appears when you move the cursor over the icon.
You know how the garbage in the can in your garage sits there until the sani-
tation engineers come by and pick it up each Thursday? The Mac OS X Trash
works the same. When you put something in the Trash, it sits there until you
choose the Finder➪Empty Trash command or use the keyboard shortcut
Ô+Shift+Delete.
While items sit in the Trash waiting for you to empty it, the Trash basket shows
you that it has files waiting for you there . . . as in real life, your unemptied
Trash is full of crumpled papers.
You can also empty the Trash from the Dock by pressing the mouse button
and holding it down on the Trash icon for a second or two. The Empty Trash
menu pops up like magic. Move your mouse over it to select it and then release
the mouse button. 
Think twice before you invoke the Empty Trash command. After you empty
the Trash, the files that it contained are (usually) gone forever. My advice:
Before you get too bold, read Chapter 8 and back up your hard drive several
times. After you get proficient at backups, chances improve greatly that even
though the files are technically gone forever from your hard drive, you can
get them back if you like (at least in theory).
As with all icons, you can open the Trash to see what’s in there — just click
its icon in the Dock. If you decide that you don’t want to get rid of an item
that’s already in the Trash, just drag it back out, either onto the Desktop or
back into the folder where it belongs.
Delving Deeper into the Dock
In this section, I tell you all about the Dock — how to use it, how to customize
it, how to resize it, and more.
The Dock is a convenient way to get at oft-used icons. By default, the Dock
comes pre-stocked with icons that Apple thinks you’ll need most frequently
(refer to Table 2-1), but you can customize it to contain any icons that you
choose, as you’ll see in the following sections.
32
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

More about Dock icons
Dock icons work like other icons — except instead of double-clicking them,
you single-click them. Note that when you single-click a Dock, it moves up
and out of its place on the Dock for a moment, letting you know that you’ve
activated it. Check out Figure 2-5 to see an animated Dock icon — it’s still on
the Dock, but it appears raised higher than the inactive icons.
Many Dock icons also do a little bouncy dance when that program isn’t active
(that is, its menu bar isn’t showing and it’s not the frontmost program) to
inform you that it desires your attention. If you notice that the icon for an
open application is dancing, give it a click to find out what it wants.
When an application on the Dock is open, an up-arrow (which looks like a
small black pyramid) appears below its Dock icon, as shown on the right in
Figure 2-5.
To discover the name of a Dock icon, just move your cursor over any item on
the Dock, and the item’s name appears above it (as shown in the middle of
Figure 2-5). This feature is quite handy because you can’t view Dock items as
a list in the same the way that you can with icons that are stored in windows.
And, as you can read in the section “Resizing the Dock” later in this chapter,
you can resize the Dock to make the icons smaller (which does make them
more difficult to see). Hovering your mouse cursor to discover the name of a
teeny icon makes this feature even more useful.
Resizing the Dock
If the default size of the Dock bugs you, you can make the Dock smaller and
save yourself a lot of screen real estate. This space comes in especially handy
when you add your own stuff to the Dock.
Figure 2-5:

33
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

To shrink or enlarge the Dock (and its icons) without opening the Dock Pref-
erences window, drag its sizer handle. To make the sizer appear (as shown 
in the left margin), move your cursor over the thin line that you find on the
right side of the Dock. Drag the sizer down to make the Dock smaller, holding
down the mouse button until you find the size you like. The more you drag
this control down, the smaller the Dock gets. To enlarge the Dock again, just
drag the sizer back up. Poof! Big Dock! You can enlarge the Dock until it fills
your screen from side to side.
Adding and removing Dock icons
You can customize your Dock with favorite applications, a document you
update daily, or maybe a folder containing your favorite recipes — use the
Dock for anything you need quick access to. The following sections tell you
how to add an icon to the Dock, how to remove a Dock icon you no longer
desire, as well as what kind of stuff you might want to put in your Dock.
Adding an icon to the Dock
Adding an application, file, or folder to the Dock is as easy as 1-2-3. First, open
a Finder window that contains an application, file, folder, URL, or disk icon
that you use frequently. Then follow these steps to add it to the Dock:
1. Click the item you want to add to the Dock.
As shown in Figure 2-6, I chose the StuffIt Expander application (it’s high-
lighted). I use StuffIt Expander constantly to decompress archives of
files received in e-mail or downloaded from newsgroups on the Internet.
(Find the StuffIt Expander application, if you’re interested, in the Utilities
folder inside your Applications folder.)
2. Drag the icon out of the Finder window and onto the Dock.
3. An icon for this item now appears on the Dock.
Folder, disk, and URL icons must be on the right of the divider line in 
the Dock; Application icons must be on the left of it. Why does the Dock
force these rules upon you? I suppose someone at Apple thinks this is
what’s best for you — who knows? — but that’s the rule: apps on the
left, folders, disks, and URLs on the right.
You can add several items at the same time to the Dock by selecting them all
and dragging the group to the Dock. However, you can delete only one icon at
a time from the Dock.
34
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Removing an icon from the Dock
To remove an item from the Dock, just drag its icon onto the Desktop. It dis-
appears with a cool poof animation, as shown in Figure 2-7.
By moving an icon out of the Dock, you aren’t moving, deleting, or copying
the item itself — you’re just removing its icon from the Dock. The item is
unchanged. Think of it like a library catalog card: Just because you remove
the card from the card catalog doesn’t mean that the book is gone from the
library.
When you open an application with an icon that doesn’t ordinarily appear on
the Dock, its icon magically appears on the Dock until you quit that applica-
tion. And when you quit, its icon magically disappears from the Dock. In other
words, you see a temporary Dock icon for every program that’s currently open;
these temporary icons disappear when you quit the program.
If you want to keep an icon in the Dock permanently, you have two ways to tell
it to stay around after you quit the program. You can Control-click (or click-
and-hold) and then choose Keep in Dock from the menu that pops up, or you
can drag the icon (for an application that’s currently open) off and then back
onto the Dock (or to a different position on the Dock) without letting go of
the mouse button.

Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

Another useful Dock menu option is Show in Finder; it opens the window con-
taining the item and thoughtfully selects the item for you.
Last, but certainly not least, you can drag a document icon onto an applica-
tion’s Dock icon. If the application knows how to handle that type of document,
its Dock icon will highlight and the document will open in that application. If
the application can’t handle that particular type of document, the Dock icon
won’t highlight and you can’t drop the document on it.
I’m getting ahead of myself here, but if that happens to you, try opening the
document this way: Select the icon and choose File➪Open With or control-
click the document icon and use the Open With menu to choose the applica-
tion you want the document opened with.
What should you put in your Dock?
Put things on the Dock that you need quick access to and that you use often,
or add items that aren’t quickly available from menus or the sidebar. If you
like using the Dock better than the Finder window sidebar, for example, add
your Documents, Movies, Pictures, Music, or even your hard disk to the Dock.
I suggest adding these items to your Dock:
 A word-processing application: Most people use word processing soft-
ware more than any other application.
 A project folder: You know, the folder that contains all the documents
for your thesis, or the biggest project you have at work, or your massive
recipe collection . . . whatever. Add that folder to the Dock and then you
can access it much quicker than if you have to open several folders to
find it.
Don’t forget — if you press (click but don’t let go) on a folder icon, a handy
hierarchical menu of its contents appears, as shown in Figure 2-4. Better
still, the same goes for disk icons. Figure 2-8 shows my hard disk’s con-
tents as a Dock menu. Give this trick a try — it’s great.
 A special utility or application: StuffIt Expander is an essential part of
my work because I receive a lot of stuffed and zipped files. You may also
want to add AOL, or your favorite graphics application such as Photo-
shop, or the game you play every afternoon when you think the boss
isn’t watching.
 Your favorite URLs: Save links to sites that you visit every day — ones
that you use in your job, your favorite Mac news sites, or your personal-
ized page from an Internet service provider (ISP). Sure, you can make
one of these pages your browser’s start page or bookmark it, but the
Dock lets you add one or more additional URLs.
36
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Here’s how to quickly add a URL to the Dock. Open Safari and go to the
page with a URL that you want to save on the Dock. Click and drag the
small icon that you find at the left of the URL in the Address bar to the
right side of the dividing line in the Dock (at the arrow’s head in Fig-
ure 2-9) and then release the mouse button. The icons in the Dock will
slide over and make room for your URL. From now on, when you click
the URL icon that you moved to your Dock, Safari opens to that page.
You can add several URL icons to the Dock, but bear in mind that the
Dock and its icons shrink to accommodate added icons, thus making
them harder to see. Perhaps the best idea — if you want easy access to
several URLs — is to create a folder full of URLs and put that folder on
the Dock. Then you can just press and hold your mouse pointer on the
folder (or Control-click the folder) to pop up a menu with all your URLs.
Even though you can make the Dock smaller, you’re still limited to one row of
icons. The smaller you make the Dock, the larger the crowd of icons you can
amass. You have to determine for yourself what’s best for you: having lots of
icons available on the Dock (even though they may be difficult to see because
they’re so tiny) or having less clutter but fewer icons on your Dock.

After you figure out which programs you use and don’t use, it’s a good idea to
relieve overcrowding by removing the ones you never (or rarely) use.
Setting your Dock preferences
You can change a few things about the Dock to make it look and behave just
the way you want it to. To do so, just choose Dock➪Dock Preferences from the
Ú menu (or the Apple menu, meaning the menu beneath that Ú symbol in 
the upper-left corner of the Finder menu bar). The System Preferences appli-
cation opens, showing an active Dock pane (see Figure 2-10).

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Now you can adjust your Dock with the following preferences:
 Dock Size: Note the slider bar here. Move this slider to the right (larger)
or left (smaller) to adjust the size of the Dock on your Finder. As you
move the slider, watch the Dock change size. (Now there’s a fun way to
spend a Saturday afternoon!)
As you add items to the Dock, each icon — and the Dock itself — shrinks
to accommodate the new ones.
 Magnification: This slider controls how big icons grow when you pass
the arrow cursor over them. Or you can deselect this check box to turn
off magnification entirely.
 Position on Screen: Choose from these three radio buttons to attach 
the Dock to the left side, the right side, or the bottom of your screen
(the default). Personally, I prefer it on the right side of the screen.
 Minimize Using: Select, from this handy pop-up menu (PC users would
call it a drop-down list, but what the heck, there’s no gravity in a com-
puter screen anyway), the visual effect (animation) that you see when
you click a window’s Minimize button (the yellow gumdrop). The Genie
Effect is the default, but the Scale Effect seems a bit faster to me.
 Animate Opening Applications: Mac OS X animates (bounces) Dock
icons when you click them to open an item. If you don’t like the anima-
tion, deselect this check box, and the bouncing will cease evermore.
 Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: Don’t like the Dock? Maybe you
want to free up the screen real estate at the bottom of your monitor? Then
select the Automatically Hide and Show the Dock check box; after that,
the Dock displays itself only when you move the cursor (mouse) to the
bottom of the screen where the dock would ordinarily appear. It’s like
magic! (Okay, it’s like Windows that way, but I hate to admit it.)
If the Dock isn’t visible, deselect (that is, uncheck) this Automatically
Hide and Show the Dock check box to bring it back. The option remains
turned off unless you change it or choose Dock➪Turn Hiding Off from
the Ú menu (or press Ô+Option+D).
Other Icons in OS X Tiger
Icons are not just used by the Dock, of course. They’re those funny little pic-
tographs you see in Finder windows that represent things you work with on
your Mac, such as programs, documents, and folders.
39
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

Don’t confuse the icons you see in Finder windows with Dock icons — they’re
two different animals. Dock icons are like buttons — you click them once and
something (a file, an application, or a folder) opens. The truth is, Dock icons
are a special type of alias (discussed shortly); they’re simply pointers to items
on your hard drive. Icons in Finder windows, on the other hand, represent
real things on your hard drive — your folders, applications, and documents.
The big difference, though, is that you can select regular icons with a single
click and open them with a double click; Dock icons can’t be selected, and
you click just once to open them.
For what it’s worth, toolbar icons (in Finder windows — discussed in Chap-
ter 4) are the same as Dock icons — they open items on your hard drive with
a single (instead of a double) click.
Anyway, to avoid any confusion, from now on I’ll refer to Dock icons (and tool-
bar icons and any other icons that open with a single click) as buttons, reserv-
ing the term icons for the little picture-thingies in Finder windows and on the
Desktop.
Finder icons come in several shapes and sizes. After you’ve been around the
Macintosh for a while, you develop a sixth sense about what an icon contains,
and know just by looking at it. The three main types of icons are applications,
documents, and folders. 
Well, there are actually four types — aliases are an icon type in their own right.
But don’t worry: I show you all four icon types right now:
 Application icons are programs — the software that you use to accom-
plish tasks on your Mac. Your word processor is an application. So are
(for example) America Online (AOL) and Adobe Photoshop. For that
matter, Halo and Unreal Tournament are also applications (and great
games to boot).
Application icons come in a variety of shapes. For example, application
(that is, program) icons are often square-ish. Sometimes they’re diamond-
shaped, rectangular, or just oddly shaped. In Figure 2-11, you can see
application icons of various shapes.
 Document icons are files that are created by applications. A letter to your
mom, which you create in AppleWorks (formerly known as ClarisWorks),
is a document. So are my latest column and my Quicken data files. Docu-
ment icons are almost always reminiscent of a piece of paper, as shown
in Figure 2-12.
 Folder icons are the Mac’s organizational containers. You can put icons —
and the applications or documents they stand for — into folders. You can
also put folders inside other folders. Folders look like . . . well, manila
folders (what a concept) . . . and can contain just about any other icon.
40
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

You use folders to organize your files and applications on your hard
drive. You can have as many folders as you want, so don’t be afraid to
create new ones. The thought behind the whole folders thing is pretty
obvious — if your hard drive is a filing cabinet, folders are its drawers
and folders (duh!). Figure 2-13 shows some typical folder icons.
 Aliases are wonderful — no, fabulous — organizational tools that Apple
introduced in the days of Mac OS 7. (Although Mac OS 7 was originally
called System 7, Apple didn’t begin the Mac OS designation until ver-
sion 7.6.) I like aliases so much, in fact, that I think they deserve their
very own section. Read on for more info on this ultra-useful tool.

Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

Aliases: Greatest Thing 
Since Sliced Bread
An alias is a tiny file that automatically opens the file that it represents.
Although an alias is technically an icon, it’s actually an icon that opens another
icon automatically. You can put aliases in convenient places, such as on the
Desktop, to help you easily open programs and files that you access often.
In effect, Microsoft stole the alias feature from Apple (if you’ve used
Windows, you may know aliases as shortcuts). But what else is new? And, for
what it’s worth, aliases usually don’t break when you move or rename the
original file; shortcuts do. 
An alias is different from a duplicated file. For example, the Microsoft Word
2004 application uses 19.4 megabytes (MB) of disk space. A duplicate of Micro-
soft Word 2004 would give me two files, each requiring nearly 20 megabytes
of space on my hard drive. An alias of Microsoft Word 2004, on the other hand,
uses a mere 52 kilobytes (KB).
Why else do I think that aliases are so great? Well, they open any file or folder
on any disk from anywhere else on any disk — which is a very good trick. But
there are many other reasons I think aliases rock:
 Convenience: Aliases enable you to make items appear to be in more
than one place, which on many occasions is exactly what you want to
do. For example, keeping an alias of your word processor on your Desktop
and another on the Dock is convenient. You may even want a third alias
of it in your Documents folder for quick access. Aliases enable you to
open your word processor quickly and easily without navigating into the
depths of your Applications folder each time that you need it.
Figure 2-13:
Some run-
of-the-mill
folder icons.
42
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

 Flexibility and organization: You can create aliases and store them any-
where on your hard disk to represent the same document in several dif-
ferent folders. This is a great help when you need to file a document that
can logically be stored in any one of several files. For example: If you
write a memo to Fred Smith about the Smythe Marketing Campaign to be
executed in the fourth quarter, which folder does the document go in?
Smith? Smythe? Marketing? Memos? 4th Quarter? Correct answer: With
aliases, it can go in all the above if you like. Then you’ll find the memo
wherever you look, instead of guessing which folder it was filed in.
With aliases, it doesn’t matter. You can put the actual file in any folder
and then create aliases of the file, placing them in any other applicable
folder. 
 Integrity: Some programs must remain in the same folder as their sup-
porting files and folders. Many Classic programs, for example, won’t
function properly unless they’re in the same folder as their dictionaries,
thesauruses, data files (for games), templates, and so on. Thus you can’t
put the icon for those programs on the Desktop without impairing their
functionality. An alias lets you access a program like that from anywhere
on your hard disk.
Creating aliases
When you create an alias, its icon looks the same as the icon that it repre-
sents, but the suffix alias is tacked onto its name and a tiny arrow called a
badge appears in the lower-left corner of its icon. Figure 2-14 shows both an
alias and its parent icon (that is, the icon that opens if you open the alias).
Figure 2-14:
An alias
icon (right)
and its
parent.
43
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

To create an alias for an icon, do one of the following:
 Click the parent icon and choose File➪Make Alias.
 Click the parent icon and press Ô+L.
 Click any file or folder, press and hold down the Ô and Option keys,
and then drag the file or folder while continuing to hold down the Ô
and Option keys.
Presto! An alias appears where you release the mouse button. Better
still, aliases created this way don’t have that pesky alias suffix tacked
onto them.
 Click an icon while holding down the Control key and then choose the
Make Alias command from the contextual menu that appears.
The alias appears in the same folder as its parent. (I explore contextual
menus — which are very cool — in Chapter 3.)
Deleting aliases
This is a short section because deleting an alias is such an easy chore. To
delete an alias, simply drag it onto the Trash icon on the Dock. That’s it! You
can also Control-click it and choose Move to Trash from the contextual menu
that appears, or select the icon and use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Delete.
44
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger
Dr. Mac’s temporary alias theory
The Desktop is an excellent place to keep things
you need most often — whether you use aliases
of documents or save the actual files on the
Desktop until you figure out where you want to
store them. I like to keep my files as well orga-
nized as possible, so when I first create a file, I
save it in its proper folder inside the Documents
folder in my Home folder. If it’s a document that I
plan to work on for more than a day or two (such
as a magazine article or book chapter), I make an
alias of the document (or folder) and plop it on
the Desktop. After I finish the article or chapter
and submit it to an editor, I trash the alias, leav-
ing the original file stashed away in its proper
folder.
Of course, you can place that same folder in the
Dock as well, so you can use the press-and-
hold trick to open its subfolders. But nothing
says you can’t have an item appear in several
places at once for maximum convenience.
Incidentally, you can use a similar technique
without the aliases. Just save all your new docu-
ments on the Desktop (yourhomefolder/
Desktop). Later, as you finish working with
each document, you can file it away in its
proper folder.

Deleting an alias does not delete the parent item. (If you want to delete the
parent item, you have to go hunt it down and kill it yourself.)
Hunting down an alias’ parent
Suppose you create an alias of a file, and later you want to delete both the alias
and its parent file — but you can’t find the parent file? What do you do? Well,
you can use the Finder’s Find function (try saying that three times real fast) to
find it; but here are three faster ways to find the parent icon of an alias:
 Select the alias icon and choose File➪Show Original.
 Select the alias icon and use the keyboard shortcut Ô+R.
 Control-click the alias icon and choose Show Original from the contex-
tual menu.
Doing More with Your Icons
After checking out the different types of icons, it’s time to see what you can
do with and to them. In the upcoming sections, I show you how to open,
rename, get rid of (again), and select icons. In a matter of moments, you’ll be
an icon pro!
Open sez me! Opening icons
You can open any icon in four ways. (Okay, there are five ways, but one of
them belongs to aliases, which I discuss earlier in the section “Other Icons in
OS X Tiger”) Anyway, here are the ways:
 Click the icon once to select it and then choose File➪Open.
 Double-click the icon by clicking it twice in rapid succession.
If it doesn’t open, you double-clicked too slowly. You can test your
mouse’s sensitivity to double-click speed as well as adjust it in the
Keyboard & Mouse System Preference pane.
 Select the icon and then press either Ô+O or Ô+↓.
 Click the icon while holding down the Control key and then use the
contextual menu’s Open command.
45
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .

Of course, you can also open any document icon from within an application —
skip ahead to Chapter 5 for more on that.
Getting rid of icons
To get rid of an icon — any icon — merely drag it to the Trash on your Dock. 
Trashing an alias gets rid of only the alias, not the parent file. But trashing a
document, folder, or application icon puts it in the Trash, where it will be
deleted permanently the next time you empty the Trash.
Playing the icon name 
game: renaming icons
Icon, icon-a, bo-bicon, banana-fanna fo-ficon. Betcha can change the name of
any old icon! Well, that’s not entirely true. . . .
If an icon is locked (see the upcoming section “Info-mation”), busy (an appli-
cation that’s currently open), or you don’t have the owner’s permission to
rename that icon (see Chapter 14 for details about permissions), you won’t
be able to rename it. Similarly, you should never rename certain reserved
icons (such as the Library, System, and Desktop folders).
To rename an icon, you can either click the icon’s name directly (don’t click
the icon itself because that selects the icon) or click the icon and then press
Return (or Enter) on your keyboard once.
Either way, the icon’s name is selected and surrounded with a box, and you
can now type in a new name (as shown in Figure 2-15). In addition to select-
ing the name, the cursor changes from a pointer to a text-editing I-beam. An 
I-beam cursor (shown in the left margin) is the Mac’s way of telling you that
you can type now. At this point, if you click the I-beam cursor anywhere in
the name box, you can edit the icon’s original name. If you don’t click the 
I-beam cursor in the name box but just begin typing, the icon’s original name
is replaced by what you type.
If you’ve never changed an icon’s name, give it a try. And don’t forget: If you
click the icon itself, the icon is selected, and you won’t be able to change its
name. If you do accidentally select the icon, just press Return (or Enter) once
to edit the name of the icon.
46
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Selecting multiple icons
Sometimes you want to move or copy several items into a single folder. The
process is pretty much the same as it is when you copy one file or folder (that
is, you just drag the icon to where you want it and drop it there). But you first
need to select all the items you want before you can drag them, en masse, to
their destination. You’ll find the following method a lot more convenient than
selecting and copying files one at a time:
1. To select more than one icon in a folder, do one of the following:
• Click once within the folder window (don’t click any one icon) and
drag your mouse while continuing to hold down the mouse button.
You see an outline of a box around the icons while you drag, and
all icons within (or touching) the box become highlighted. (See
Figure 2-16.)
Figure 2-15:
Change an
icon’s name
by typing

old one
when it’s
highlighted.
47
Chapter 2: I Think Icon, I Think Icon . . .
Navigating icons like a supergeek
In addition to the old point-and-click method of
navigating icons, you can also move among
icons by using the keyboard. In an active
window, make sure that no icons are selected
and then type the first letter of a file’s name. In
all views, the first icon that starts with that letter
is selected. To move to the next icon alphabeti-
cally, press the Tab key. To move to the icon in
reverse alphabetical order, press Shift+Tab.
If more than one icon begins with the same letter,
type in more than one letter to further restrict the
possible results. Suppose that you have three
folders in the same window that all begin with A:
Applications, Abstracts, and Aunt Mary’s Stuff.
To select the Applications folder, type app.
If no window is active, typing a letter selects the
first icon on the Desktop that starts with that
letter. Press the Tab key or press Shift+Tab 
to work your way through the icon names
alphabetically forward or backward, respec-
tively. Finally, pressing Ô+O or Ô+↓opens the
selected item.

• Click one icon and then hold down the Shift key while you click
others. As long as you hold down the Shift key, each new icon that
you click is added to the selection. To deselect an icon, click it a
second time while still holding down the Shift key.
• Click one icon and then hold down the Command (Ô) key while
you click others. The difference between using the Shift and the 
Ô keys is that using the Ô key doesn’t select everything between it
and the first item selected when your window is in a List or Column
view. In an Icon view, it really doesn’t make much difference.
To deselect an icon selected in any of these three ways, click it while
holding down the Ô key.
2. When you select all the icons that you want, click one of them (don’t
click anywhere else or you deselect the icons that you just selected)
and drag (or Option+drag) them to the location where you want to
move (or copy) them.
Be careful with multiple selections, especially when you drag icons to the
Trash. You can easily — and accidentally — select more than one icon, so
watch out that you don’t accidentally put the wrong icon in the Trash by not
paying close attention.
If you put something in the Trash by accident, you can almost always return
it whence it came: Just invoke the magical Undo command. Choose Edit➪
Undo or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Z. The accidentally trashed file will
return to its original location. Usually.
Figure 2-16:
Select more
than one
icon with
your mouse.
48
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Unfortunately, Undo doesn’t work every time — and it only remembers the
very last action that you performed when it does work — so don’t rely on it
too much.
Info-mation
Every icon has an Info window that gives you — big surprise! — information
about that icon and enables you to choose which other users (if any) that
you want to have the privilege of using this icon. (I discuss sharing files and
privileges in detail in Chapter 14.) The Info window is also where you lock an
icon so that it can’t be renamed or dragged to the Trash.
To see an icon’s Info window, click the icon and choose File➪Get Info (or
press Ô+I) The Info window for that icon appears, as in Figure 2-17, which
shows the Info window for the QuickTime Player icon.
Documents, folders, and disks each have slightly different Info windows. In
this section, I give you highlights on the type of information and options that
you can find.
The gray triangles reveal what information for an icon is available in this par-
ticular Info window. Figure 2-17 shows the options for the QuickTime Player
with the General section expanded. The sections that you see for most icons
include the following:

• Kind: What kind of file this is — an application, document, disk,
folder, and so on
• Size: How much disk space this file uses
• Where: The path to the folder that contains this file
• Created: The date and time that this file was created
• Modified: The date and time that this file was last modified (that
is, saved)
• Version: Copyright information and the file’s version number
 Name & Extension: Tells the full name, including the (possibly hidden)
extension.
 Color Label: Choose or change the color label (discussed in Chapter 4)
for this item.
 Preview: When you select a document icon, the menu offers a Preview
option that you use to see a glimpse of what’s in that document. You 
can also see this preview when you select a document icon in Column
view — it magically appears in the rightmost column. If you select a
QuickTime movie or sound, you can even play it right there in the pre-
view pane without launching a separate application. Neat.
 Languages: Manages the language that the application uses for menus
and dialogs. 
This option only appears if you’re using an Info window to look at 
certain application programs (usually the sort that contain multiple
.lproj folders within their Contents/Resources folders).

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger
Why would you want to run an app in Classic?
I once had a great USB printer (Epson Stylus
Photo 750) that wasn’t supported in OS X,
although it worked fine in Classic. I could do
most of my printing from Word and Photoshop
in Classic, but every so often I needed to print a
file created by some OS X-only program. I
couldn’t print from OS X, but I could save the file
as a PDF (something almost every OS X program
can do because PDF support is built into OS X’s
Quartz imaging architecture). Then, I used the
Open in the Classic Environment feature to tell
my copy of Acrobat 5 to open as a Classic appli-
cation instead of a Mac OS X application, thus
allowing me to print the formerly unprintable
document from Classic.

 Ownership & Permissions: Governs which users have access to this
icon and how much access they are allowed. (See Chapter 14 for more
about access privileges.)
 Comments: Provides a field in which you type your own comments
about this icon.
 Open in the Classic Environment check box: This option is available
for only some applications, known as Carbon apps — programs developed
to run on both OS 9 and OS X. Selecting this check box lets you run some
Carbon application in the Classic environment. (Don’t worry if you don’t
know what this means — Classic is discussed in full and loving detail,
but not until Chapter 12.)
 The Locked check box: Enabling this shows you whether you can
change an icon’s name or drag it to the Trash. When an application is
locked (this check box will be marked), you can’t change its name or
drag it to the Trash. (I discuss the Trash earlier in this chapter.)
Only document and folder icons can be locked; disk and application
icons can’t. 
 The Stationery check box: Document icons sport these. Stationery is a
special type of document file that acts as a template. When you open
any document for which you’ve marked this check box, the document
opens with all the information in it but it’s named Untitled — you have
to use Save As to save and rename the file.
The Stationery document remains unchanged even after you open it;
you can use it again and again to open a document with some of its con-
tent already in place.

indows are and have always been an integral part of Macintosh com-

show you the contents of hard drive and folder icons; windows in applica-
tions do many things. The point is that windows are part of what makes your
Mac a Mac; knowing how they work — and how to use them — is essential.
Like icons and windows, menus are a quintessential part of the Macintosh
experience. The latter part of this chapter starts you out with a few menu
basics and then moves on to the Finder menus. I provide a level of detail
based on each menu item’s importance; as needed, I direct you to other 
parts of the book for greater detail.
One last thing: The windows discussed in this chapter are Finder windows.
After you get the hang of Finder windows, you have the hang of using most of
the windows you ever see on your Mac.

So relax and don’t worry. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be ready to work
with windows and menus in any application that uses them (and most appli-
cations, games excluded, do).
Anatomy of a Window
Like icons, windows are a ubiquitous part of using a Mac. The Finder appears
in a window. When you open a folder, it’s a window that you see. When you
write a letter, the document that you’re working on appears in a window,
when you browse the Internet, Web pages appear in a window, and so on.
For the most part, windows are windows from program to program. You’ll
probably notice that some programs (Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Word,
for example) take liberties with windows by adding features (such as pop-up
menus) or textual information (such as zoom percentage or file size) in the
scroll-bar area of a document window.
Don’t let it bug you; that extra fluff is just window dressing (pun intended).
Maintaining the window metaphor, many information windows display differ-
ent kinds of information in different panes (discrete sections).
Windows in programs running in the Classic environment look different —
like Mac OS 9 windows. (I cover the Classic environment in Chapter 12.)
And so, without further ado, the following list gives you a look at the main
features of a typical Finder window (as shown in Figure 3-1). I discuss these
features in greater detail in later sections of this chapter.
If your windows don’t look exactly like the one shown in Figure 3-1, don’t be
concerned. You can use what you find in this chapter (and the next) to make
your Finder windows look and feel any way you like. Hang in there.
Meanwhile, here’s what you see:
 Window Title: Shows the name of the window.
 Scroll bars: Used for moving around a window pane.
 Sidebar: Where frequently-used items live.
 Toolbar: Buttons for frequently-used commands and actions live here.
 Forward and Back buttons: Take you to the next or previous folder dis-
played in this particular window.
If you’re familiar with Web browsers, the Forward and Back buttons in
the Finder work exactly the same way. The first time you open a window,
neither button is active. But as you navigate from folder to folder, they
remember your breadcrumb trail so you can quickly traverse backward
54
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

or forward, window by window. You can even navigate this way from the
keyboard, by using the shortcuts Ô+[ for Back and Ô+] for Forward.
If you’ve set a Finder Preference so a folder always opens in a new
window — or if you forced a folder to open in a new window (which I’ll
describe in a bit) — the Forward and Back buttons won’t work. You have
to use the modern, OS X-style window option — the one that uses a
single window — or the buttons are useless. 
In other words, the Forward and Back buttons remember only the other
folders you’ve visited that appear in that window (the open one).
 View buttons: Choose from three exciting views of your window: icon,
list, or column.
 Action button: This button is really a pop-up menu of commands you
can apply to currently selected items in the Finder window.
 Close, Minimize, and Expand (gumdrop) buttons: Shut ’em, shrink and
place them ’em in the Dock, and make ’em grow.
 Search box: Find items whose names contain the character string you
type here.
 Hide/Show toolbar button: Causes your computer to melt into a puddle
of molten silicon slag. Just kidding! This button actually does what its
name implies — hides or shows the toolbar (and sidebar) of a window.

This frosts me. If you hide the toolbar, the sidebar is also hidden, whether
you like it or not. Conversely, if you want to see the toolbar, you have no
choice but to also see the sidebar. So if you want to hide the toolbar and see
the sidebar (or vice versa) you’re $#&* out of luck. If I had my druthers, I’d
hide the toolbar (which I rarely use), and keep the sidebar (which I use con-
stantly). For some unfathomable reason, Apple doesn’t allow that.
Top o’ the window to ya!
Take a gander at the top of a window — any window. You see three buttons in
the upper-left corner and the name of the window in the top center. These
three buttons (called gumdrop buttons by some folks because they look like,
well, gumdrops) in the upper-left corner of the window — officially known 
as Close, Minimize, and Zoom (some people call this button by its Mac OS 9
name, Grow) — are colored red, orange, and green (from left to right). Here’s
what they do:
 Close (red): Click this button to close the window.
 Minimize (orange): Click this button to minimize the window. Clicking
Minimize appears to close the window, but instead of making it disap-
pear, Minimize adds an icon for the window in the Dock. To view the
window again, click the Dock icon for the window that you minimized. If
the window happens to be a QuickTime movie, the movie continues to
play, albeit at postage-stamp size, in its icon in the Dock. (I discuss the
Dock in Chapter 2.)
 Zoom (green): Click this button to make the window larger or smaller,
depending on its current size. If you’re looking at a standard size
window, clicking Zoom usually makes it bigger. (I say usually because if
the window is larger than its contents, clicking this button shrinks the
window to the smallest size that can completely enclose the contents
without scrolling.) Click the Zoom button again to return the window to
its original size.
A scroll new world
Yet another way to see more of what’s in a window or pane is to scroll through
it. Scroll bars appear at the bottom and right sides of any window or pane
that contains more stuff — icons, text, pixels, or whatever — than you can
see in the window. Figure 3-2, for example, shows two instances of the same
window: Dragging the scroll bar on the right side of the front window reveals
the items above Font Book and GarageBand and below Mail and Preview,
56
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

which you can see in the expanded window in the background. Dragging the
scroll bar on the bottom of the window reveals items to the left and right,
such as iChat, iMovie, Internet Connect, and iSync.
Simply click and drag a scroll bar to move it either up or down or side to
side. And yes, the scroll bars also look a bit gumdrop-like. As best as I can
tell, Steve Jobs (Apple’s charismatic CEO) has a thing for gumdrops.
You can scroll in the following four ways:
 Click a scroll bar and drag. The content of the window scrolls propor-
tionally to how far you drag the scroll bar.
 Click in the scroll bar area but not on the scroll bar itself. The window
scrolls either one page up (if you click above the scroll bar) or down (if
you click below the scroll bar). If the scroll-bar area is white (that is, it
doesn’t have a blue scroll bar showing), you have no items to scroll to —
which means the window already contains everything visible. You can
change a setting in your General System Preference pane (discussed in
Chapter 13) to cause the window to scroll proportionally to where you
click.
For what it’s worth, the Page Up and Page Down keys function the same
as clicking the grayish scroll-bar area (the vertical scroll bar only) in the
Finder and many applications. But these keys don’t work in every pro-
gram; don’t become too dependent on them. Also, if you’ve purchased a

mouse, trackball, or other pointing device with a scroll wheel, you can
scroll vertically in the active (front) window with the scroll wheel, or
press and hold the Shift key to scroll horizontally.
 Click a scroll arrow at the top or bottom of a scroll area. By default,
both arrows appear at the bottom of the scroll bar. The window scrolls 
a little; press and hold a scroll arrow, and the window scrolls a lot. Click
the up-pointing arrow to scroll toward the beginning and the down-
pointing arrow to scroll toward the end.
If you have your General System Preferences set to have the scroll arrows
together rather than at top and bottom, they’ll be at the bottom and
right of the scroll areas, as shown in Figure 3-2. If you don’t, you’ll see
one arrow at each end of the scroll area.
 Use the keyboard. In the Finder, first click an icon in the window and
then use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right. Using an arrow
key selects the next icon in the direction it indicates — and automati-
cally scrolls the window, if necessary. In other programs, you may or
may not be able to use the keyboard to scroll. The Page Up and Page
Down keys work in most programs, but many programs don’t use the
arrow keys for scrolling their windows. The best advice I can give you 
is to try it — either it’ll work or it won’t.
In the Finder, you can also press the Tab key on the keyboard to select
the next icon in the active window alphabetically and press Shift+Tab to
select the previous icon alphabetically.
(Hyper) Active windows
To work within a window, the window must be active. The active window is
always the frontmost window, and inactive windows always appear behind
the active window. Only one window can be active at a time. To make a
window active, click it anywhere — in the middle, on the title bar, or on a
scroll bar — it doesn’t matter where, with one proviso: You can’t click the
red, orange, or green gumdrop buttons or the clear hide/show button of an
inactive window to activate it.
When you hover your mouse pointer over the red, orange, or green gumdrop
buttons of an inactive window — but don’t click your mouse button — the
gumdrops light up, enabling you to close, minimize, or expand an inactive
window without first making it active.
Look at Figure 3-3 for an example of an active window (the Applications
window) in front of an inactive window (the Utilities window).
58
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

The following is a list of the major visual cues that distinguish active from
inactive windows:
 The active window’s title bar: The Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons —
the red, orange, and green ones — are, well, red, orange, and green. The
inactive windows’ buttons are not.
This is a nice visual cue — colored items are active and gray ones are
inactive. Better still, if you move your mouse over an inactive window’s
gumdrop buttons, they light up in their usual colors so you can close, min-
imize, or expand an inactive window without first making it active. Neat!
 Other buttons and scroll bars in an active window look different:
They’re bright. In an inactive window, these features are grayed out and
more subdued.
 Active windows have bigger and darker drop shadows: They grab your
attention more than those of inactive windows.
Dialog Dealie-Boppers
Dialogs are special windows that pop up over the active window. You gener-
ally see them when you select a menu item that ends in an ellipsis (...). 
Inactive window
Active window
Figure 3-3:

59
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

Dialogs can contain a number of standard Macintosh features (I call them
dealie-boppers), such as radio buttons, pop-up menus, text-entry boxes, and
check boxes. You see these features again and again in dialogs. Take a moment
to look at each of these dealie-boppers in Figure 3-4.
 Radio buttons: Radio buttons are so named because, like the buttons 
on your car radio (if you have a very old car), only one at a time can be
active (when they’re active, they appear to be pushed in, just like the
old radio buttons). Radio buttons always appear in a group of two or
more; when you select one, all the others are automatically deselected.
Eggheads call this setup mutually exclusive. Take a look at Figure 3-4 for
an example of radio buttons.
As shown in Figure 3-4, the second radio button (Rich Text) is selected.
If you were to click the radio button above it for Plain Text, you would
deactivate (deselect) Rich Text. Got it? Good. Moving right along . . . .
Here’s a nifty and undocumented shortcut: You can usually select check
boxes and radio buttons by clicking their names (instead of the buttons
or boxes). Didn’t know that, did ya?
 Pop-up menus: These menus are appropriately named because that’s
what they do — they pop up when you click them. You can always tell 
a pop-up menu — it appears in a slightly rounded rectangle and has a

double-ended arrow symbol (or, a pair of back-to-back triangles if you
like) on the right. For an example, check out Figure 3-4 (the Open and
Save pop-up menus both read Automatic).
Have you figured out yet what radio buttons and pop-up menus have in
common? Hint: They both enable you to make a single selection from a
group of options. (Well, okay, that was more of an answer than a hint.)
 Text-entry boxes: In text-entry boxes (sometimes called fields), you type
in text (including numbers) from the keyboard. When you see one or
more text-entry boxes sporting a selected radio button, you can only
make an entry when that radio button is selected. In Figure 3-4 (for exam-
ple), the Window Width and Window Height options are both text-entry
boxes.
 Check boxes: The last dealie-bopper that you see frequently is the
check box. You use check boxes to choose items that are not mutually
exclusive. In a group of check boxes, you can select or deselect each one
individually. Check boxes are selected when they contain a check mark,
and they are deselected when they’re empty. Unlike radio buttons, which
force you to choose one (and only one) item, check boxes are indepen-
dent. Each one can be either selected or deselected. In Figure 3-4, you
can see several check boxes, four of which are selected and five of which
are not.
Some applications have what they call tri-state check boxes (and no, we’re not
talking geography here). These special check boxes are empty when every-
thing selected doesn’t have this feature applied, sport an x when everything
does, and sport a – when some selected items have the feature and some
don’t. This type of check box is often used for the Custom Install screen of
Mac OS X installers.
Working with Windows
In this section, I give you a closer look at windows themselves: how you
move them, size them, and use them. And although Mac OS X windows are
similar to windows you’ve used in other versions of Mac OS, you’ll find some
new wrinkles.
If you’re relatively new to the Mac, you may want to read this section while
sitting at your computer, trying the techniques as you read them. You may
find it easier to remember something that you read if you actually do it. If
you’ve been using your Mac for a while, you probably figured out how win-
dows work by now.
61
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

Resizing windows
If you want to see more (or less) of what’s in a window, use the sizer in the
extreme lower-right corner of a window. (Refer to Figure 3-1 to see the sizer;
it’s in the lower-right corner and has little diagonal grippy lines on it). Just
drag the sizer downward and/or to the right to make a window larger. Or drag
it upward and/or to the left to make a window smaller. In other words, after
you grab the sizer, you can make a window whatever size you like.
Resizing window panes
Display windows, like those in the Finder, frequently consist of multiple panes.
In the metal-looking strip between two panes you’ll often encounter what
looks, at first glance, like a speck of dirt on your monitor. On closer inspec-
tion, you’ll see a tiny knob (as in Figure 3-1, between the Sidebar and the
actual contents of the window to the right of it).
When your mouse is over that knob, the cursor changes to a vertical bar (or
it could be horizontal if the panes are one above the other) with little arrows
pointing out of both sides.
When you see this cursor, you can click and drag anywhere in the strip that
divides the Sidebar from the rest of the window. Doing so resizes the two
panes relative to each other (one will get larger and one smaller). And double-
clicking this knob usually expands the more important pane to full-size and
hides the other pane completely. Usually. 
Moving windows
To move a window, click anywhere in a window’s title bar (or anywhere in the
metallic part of a display window, except on a knob) and drag the window to
wherever you want it. The window moves wherever you move the mouse,
stopping dead in its tracks when you release the mouse button.
Shutting yo’ windows
Now that I’ve gone on and on about windows, maybe I should tell you how to
close them. You can close an active window in one of three ways (the last two
require the window to be active, by the way):
62
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

 Click the red Close button in the upper-left corner of the title bar.
 Choose File ➪Close Window from the Finder menu.
 Press Ô+W.
Hold down Option (and occasionally Control, Ô, or come combination of the
three) and pull down menus in both the Finder and in your favorite applica-
tion programs. It doesn’t always reveal anything interesting in the menu, but
sometimes it does.
And that should just about do it for windows. Next up: menus . . . 
Menu Basics
Mac menus are often referred to as pull-down menus. To check out the Mac
OS X menus, click the Finder button in the Dock to activate the Finder and
then look at the top of your screen. From left to right you see the Apple
menu, the Finder menu, and six other menus that I discuss throughout this
chapter, as shown in Figure 3-5. To use an OS X menu, you click its name to
make the menu appear and then pull (drag) down to select a menu item.
Piece of cake!
Ever since Mac OS 8, menus stay down after you click their names. They stay
down until you either select an item or click outside the menu’s boundaries.
63
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus
Hunting the seldom-seen Close All command
If you’re like me, by the end of the day your
Desktop is cluttered with open windows —
sometimes a dozen or more. Wouldn’t you love
to be able to close them all at once with a single
Close All command? But you don’t see a Close
All command in any of the menus, do you?
Well, even though Apple (in its infinite wisdom)
has hidden this useful command from mere
mortals, you can make it come out and play by
doing one of the following:
 Hold down the Option key and click any
window’s red gumdrop Close button.
 Hold down the Option key and choose File➪
Close All. (The Close All command usually
reads Close Window but becomes Close All
when you hold down the Option key. Release
the Option key, and it changes back to Close
Window.)
 Press Ô+Option+W.

Before you start working with OS X menus, you really, really should know this
about menus in general: They can change unexpectedly. Why? Well, the menus
you see in the menu bar at the top of the screen always reflect the program
that’s active at the time. When you switch from the Finder to a particular 
program — or from one program to another — the menus change immediately
to match whatever you switched to.
For example, when the Finder is active, the menu bar looks like Figure 3-5. But
if you launch TextEdit, the menu bar changes to what you see in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6:

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Figure 3-6 demonstrates a fantastic feature introduced in OS X 10.3 Panther —
TextEdit can now open documents created by Microsoft Word. The window
shown above is displaying this chapter, a Microsoft Word document that
TextEdit was not only able to open, but was able to open with almost all of 
its formatting intact. That’s slick.
An easy way to tell which program is active is to look at the leftmost menu
with a name (the one just to the right of the Apple menu). When you’re in the
Finder, of course, that menu reads Finder. But if you switch to another pro-
gram (by clicking its icon on the Dock or by clicking any window associated
with the program) or launch a new program, that menu changes to the name
of the active program.
I cover only the menus that are part of OS X here in this chapter. The menus
that come with other programs are beyond the purview of this book — this
chapter alone would be a set of encyclopedias if I tried to cover them all, and
there would always be some new program or version that wasn’t covered!
Contextual menus: They’re sooo sensitive
Contextual menus are, as the name implies, context sensitive; they list com-
mands that apply only to the item that is currently selected. Contextual menus
may be available in windows, on icons, and most places on the Desktop. To
use them, you hold down the Control key and click — what we Mac users like
to call a Control+click. Figure 3-7 shows the contextual menu that appears
when you Control+click a document icon.
Figure 3-7:
Only
relevant
items

contextual
menu.
65
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

Actions appear in contextual menus only if they make sense for the item that
you Control+click. For example, if you Control+click inside a window but you
don’t click any icon, the contextual menu contains actions that you perform
on a window. By contrast, if you Control+click an icon inside a window, you
see a contextual menu for that icon. In a similar way, a contextual menu for a
document differs from that of a window.
Don’t believe me? Control+click the Desktop (that is, click somewhere that’s
not in any window and not on any icon). The contextual menu that appears
contains only items that apply to the Desktop, and no item that pertains to a
document. Don’t believe me? Compare the Desktop contextual menu shown
in Figure 3-8 with the document contextual menu shown in Figure 3-7.
That’s why they call ’em contextual! They stick to the immediate context.
Contextual menus are also available in many applications. Open your favorite
app and try Control+clicking to find out whether they’re there. In most cases,
using a contextual menu is a quick way to avoid going to the menu bar to
choose a command. In some programs, such as AppleWorks 6, iMovie, iTunes,
and many more, contextual menus are the only way to access certain 
commands.
To make the Finder-related contextual menus available to users who didn’t
have the foresight to purchase this book, Apple added the Actions button to
the toolbar in the previous version of OS X (10.3 Panther). So these days,
people who don’t know about Control+clicking (or have only one free hand)
can access their contextual menus by clicking the Actions button and dis-
playing the contextual menu; you, on the other hand, gentle reader, know
how to get at these commands without having to run your mouse all the way
up to the toolbar.

66
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

I’m a big fan of multi-button mice, and contextual menus are a huge reason
for this preference. Just about the first thing I do when I get a new Mac is
replace the standard mouse (pretty as it is) with a multi-button mouse. When
you have a mouse (or trackball) with at least two buttons, OS X knows that
clicking the right button is the same as Control+clicking. Now, I only have to
use one hand to access these little beauties.
Get in the habit of Control+clicking (or right-clicking if your mouse has more
than one button) items. Before you know it, using contextual menus will
become second nature to you.
Disabled options
Menu items that appear in black on a menu are currently available. Menu
items not currently available are grayed out, meaning they’re disabled for the
time being. You can’t select a disabled menu item.
In Figure 3-9, the File menu on the left is pulled down while nothing is selected
in the Finder; this is why many of the menu items are disabled (in gray).
These items are disabled because an item (such as a window or icon) must
be selected in order for you to use one of these menu items. For example, the
Show Original command is grayed out because it works only if the selected
item is an alias. In the picture on the right, I selected a document before I
pulled down the menu; notice that many of the formerly disabled commands
are enabled when an icon is selected.

Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

Submenus
Some menu items have more menus attached to them, and these are called
submenus — menus that are subordinate to a menu item. You can tell whether
a menu item has a submenu if it has a black triangle to the right of its name.
To use a submenu, click a menu name once (to drop the menu down) and
then slide your cursor down to any item with a black triangle. When the item
is highlighted, move your mouse to the right just slightly. The submenu should
pop out of the original menu’s item. Figure 3-5 shows an example: the Recent
Folders submenu opens underneath the Go menu. If you were to release the
mouse button while doing exactly what is pictured, a Finder window would
pop open, showing you a Finder window displaying your Applications folder.
The pop-up menus that you see when you click-and-hold (or Control+click) 
a Dock icon can also have submenus. In fact, if you were to put your Home
folder in the Dock, you could access any file in it — or in its subfolders — via
the menu and its submenus, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Submenus used to be called hierarchical menus, but that’s a mouthful. For a
while, people liked to call them pull-right menus. But these days, just about
everyone refers to them as submenus. If you ever hear folks talk about hierar-
chical menus or pull-rights, they’re talking about submenus.
Keyboard shortcut commands
Most menu items, or at least the most common ones, have keyboard shortcuts
to help you quickly navigate your Mac without having to haggle so much with
the mouse. Using these key combinations activates menu items without using
Figure 3-10:
Drag your
Home folder

Dock and

conve-
nience of
submenus.
68
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

the mouse; to use them you press the Command (Ô) key and then press
another key (or keys) without releasing the Ô key. Memorize the shortcuts
that you use often.
Some people refer to the Command key as the Apple key. That’s because on
many keyboards, that key has both the pretzel-like Command-key symbol (Ô)
and an Apple logo (Ú) on it. To avoid confusion, I’ll always refer to Ô as the
Command key.
Here are five things to know that will give you a handle on keyboard shortcuts:
 Keyboard shortcuts are shown in menus. For example, Figure 3-5 shows
that the keyboard shortcut for the Find command appears on the menu
after the word Find: Ô+F. Any menu item with one of these pretzel-symbol-
letter combinations after its name can be executed with that keyboard
shortcut. Just press the Ô key and the letter shown in the menu — N for
New Finder Window, F for Find, and so on — and the appropriate com-
mand executes.
 Capital letters don’t mean that you have to press Shift as part of the
shortcut. Although the letters next to the Ô symbol in the Finder menus
are indeed capitals, they just identify the letters; you don’t have to press
the Shift key to use the keyboard shortcut. For example, if you see Ô+P,
just hold down the Ô key and then press P. Some programs have key-
board combinations that require the use of Ô and the Shift key, but
those programs tell you so by calling the key combination something
like ⇑+Ô+ S or ⇑+Ô+ O. A very few (usually older) programs indicate
when you need to use the Shift key by using the word Shift rather than
the ⇑symbol.
Of course, there’s an exception to every rule, and one of them is Mac
Help, which does demand the ⇑key in its shortcut, but you’ll get that
whole sordid story in a few pages.
 Recognize the funky-looking Option key symbol. You’ll see one other
symbol sometimes used in keyboard shortcuts: It represents the Option
key (sometimes abbreviated in keyboard shortcuts as Opt and, on some
keyboards, also labeled Alt). Check it out next to the Hide Others com-
mand, shown in Figure 3-11.
What this freakish symbol means in the Finder menu item (Hide Others
in Figure 3-11) is that if you press both the Ô and Option keys and hold
them down as you press the H key, all applications other than the Finder
will be hidden.
 Okay, there was more than one more symbol. Occasionally you’ll see a
caret (^) used as the abbreviation for the Control key, as shown in Figure
3-12. It points up; think uppercase.
69
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

 If it makes sense, it’s probably a shortcut. Most keyboard shortcuts
have a mnemonic relationship to their names. For example, here are
some of the more basic keyboard shortcuts:
Command

Ô+N
New Folder

It’s elliptical
Another feature of Mac menus is the ellipsis after some menu-item names.
Ellipses, in case your English teacher forgot to mention them, are the three
little dots ( ... ) that appear in place of missing text. They basically mean that
you can reach more options by clicking the menu item.
Those three little dots aren’t separate, though — they make up one character.
If you want to type an ellipsis, you can do so (in most fonts) by holding down
the Option key and pressing the semicolon (colon) key.
When you see an ellipsis after a menu item, choosing that item displays a
dialog or sheet, in which you can make further choices. (I discuss dialogs 
and sheets in Chapter 5.) Refer to Figure 3-11 to see that the Preferences 
command has an ellipsis. If you choose Preferences, the Finder Preferences
window opens.
Choosing a menu item with an ellipsis never actually makes anything happen
other than to open a dialog (whether in the form of a box or a sheet); from
there, you make further choices and then click a button. This button is usu-
ally called OK or Cancel, but occasionally — as in the Finder Preferences
dialog — you use the red Close button/gumdrop in the upper-left corner of
the window to dismiss the dialog.
Underneath the Apple Menu Tree
The Macintosh interface has sported an Apple (Ú) menu since time immemo-
rial (well, the 1980s anyway). So when the Mac OS X Public Beta appeared
without an Apple menu, Mac users everywhere crawled out of the woodwork
to express their outrage. The bruised Apple ultimately relented, and now OS X
has an Ú menu, as did every version of Mac OS before it. 
Alas, you can’t customize the OS X Apple Menu the way you used to 
under OS 9.
71
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

If you miss customizing your Apple menu, try Fruit Menu from Unsanity
(www.unsanity.com), a fabulous shareware offering that provides all the
functionality of the OS 9 Ú menu and is reasonably priced at $10.
You won’t find any programs available from the new OS X Ú menu — no
Calculator, no Scrapbook, no programs at all (other than System Preferences
and the ones in your Recent Items submenu). Instead, the Ú menu provides a
set of useful commands, described here, that are always available no matter
what program is active.
From top to bottom, the Apple menu’s items are
 About This Mac: Choose this item to see what version of Mac OS X
you’re running, what kind of Mac and processor you’re using, and how
much memory your Mac has. The window that appears also sports a Get
Info button that will launch Apple System Profiler; there you can find out
more than you’ll probably ever want or need to know about your Mac’s
hardware and software.
If you click the version number in this window, it changes to the build
number (Apple’s internal tracking number for versions). Click the build
number in this window, and it changes to the serial number of your Mac.
Finally, click the serial number of your Mac in this window, and it changes
to the version number again. This interesting effect is shown in Figure
3-13. Any or all of this information may come in handy for troubleshoot-
ing, repair, upgrades, or who knows what else. At least now you know
where to find it.
 Software Update: If you’re connected to the Internet, choose this item to
have your Mac check with the mothership (Apple) to see whether any
updates are available for OS X or its included applications (or even
Apple-branded peripheral devices, such as the iPod).
72
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger
Location, location, location
I’m getting a little bit ahead of myself, but
because you’re probably wondering, a location
reflects all the settings made in the Network
System Preferences pane. They’re mostly useful
to PowerBook and iBook users, who often have
different network configurations (locations) for
different places where they may need to use
their Macs — such as the office (to connect to
an Ethernet network), home (to connect to a
Digital Subscriber Line [DSL] or cable connec-
tion), and out of town (to connect using an inter-
nal modem). Each configuration (for office, home,
and out of town) corresponds to a location, and
you can switch from one location to another
quickly and painlessly by using this menu item.
Got it? If not, you will after you read Chapter 9.

 Mac OS X Software: This launches your Web browser and takes you to
the Apple Web site.
 System Preferences: Choose this item to open the System Preferences
window (which I discuss in great detail in Chapter 13).
 Dock (submenu): This lets you mess with, well, the Dock! Scour Chapter 2
for more info on the Dock.
 Location (submenu): This enables you to switch network configurations
quickly. I describe locations and network configurations in Chapter 9.
 Recent Items (submenu): Your Mac keeps track of the applications and
documents that you’ve recently used. Expand this menu item to choose
one of them. You can set the maximum number of applications and docu-
ments that Recent Items tracks in your General System Preference pane.
 Force Quit: When a program misbehaves — freezes or otherwise becomes
recalcitrant — this is the command for you. Choosing this brings up the
Force Quit Applications dialog, from which you choose the application
that you want to quit (as shown in Figure 3-14).
This command is so handy that it has a keyboard shortcut: Ô+Option+
powerbutton. It also has an alternate keyboard shortcut, Ô+Shift+Esc,
which is not on the menu but is displayed on the Force Quit Applications
window (lower-left part of Figure 3-8).
Unlike earlier versions of Mac OS, you don’t need to reboot to continue
working after you force a program to quit in OS X. If a program ever freaks
out on you, Force Quit can almost certainly put it out of its misery and
allow you to continue using your Mac.
 Sleep: This puts your Mac into its low-powered sleep mode. I talk more
about sleep in Chapter 13. (Yawn!)

 Restart: Choose this to reboot your Mac, which is essentially the same
as shutting down your machine and then turning it back on.
 Shut Down: Use this to turn off your Mac safely.
 Log Out: Because OS X is a multiuser operating system, you can have
multiple users at one Mac. This command enables you to switch users
without restarting or shutting down.
Logging out means that the current user, as identified by username and
password, is leaving the scene. The next person to use the Mac (even if
it’s you) has to enter a username and password to regain entry. All this
sharing stuff can be found in Chapter 14.
The Restart, Shut Down, and Log Out options have ellipses next to them and
will display an Are You Sure dialog. If you don’t want to have to bother with
the dialog, press the Option key before selecting one of the options from the
menu; the ellipses disappear and the dialog won’t intrude.
Your Constant Companion: 
The Application Menu
The very first menu on the Mac OS X menu bar is the Application menu — 
so named because it includes commands you use to control the way lots of
things work in the current application. But it’s really much more than a com-
mand center for the application.
When you have an application open, the Application menu name changes to
the name of that application, and the commands available change — but just
a little bit. (I discuss this unusual phenomenon in the section “Menu Basics,”
Figure 3-14:
Use 
Force Quit
Applications

a badly
behaved
program.
74
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

earlier in this chapter.) What makes this cool is that you have access to some
standard Application menu items even when you’re running an application
such as AppleWorks or Safari. (I have more to say about that as I work my
way through the Application menu.)
The following list is an overview of the main items in the Application menu,
which is called the Finder menu when the Finder is the active application. It’s
not too long, but it’s packed with useful goodies, such as
 About Finder: Choose this to find out which version of the Finder is run-
ning on your Mac.
Okay, so this menu item isn’t particularly useful — or at least not for
very long. But when a different application is running, the About Finder
item becomes About application_name and usually gives information
about the program’s version number, the developers (the company and
the people), and any other tidbits that those developers decide to throw
in. Sometimes these tidbits are useful, sometimes they’re interesting,
and sometimes they’re both.
 Preferences: Use choices here to control how the Desktop looks and
acts. Choosing Preference opens the Finder Preferences window, which
has four panes: General, Labels, Sidebar, and Advanced. All panes are
shown in Figure 3-15.
• In the General pane, select the Show These Items on the Desktop
check boxes to choose whether icons for hard drives, CDs, DVDs,
and other types of disks and servers appear on the Desktop. OS X
selects all three options by default (which mimics earlier versions
of Mac OS). But if you don’t want disk icons cluttering your beauti-
ful Desktop, you have the option of deselecting (clearing) them. If
they’re deselected, you can still work with CDs, DVDs, and other
types of disks. You just have to open a Finder window and click the
one you want from the top portion of the Sidebar.
• You can also choose whether opening a new Finder window dis-
plays your Home directory, the Computer window, or some other
directory. (Home is the default.)
• The Always Open Folders in a New Window check box makes OS X
work the same way as Mac OS 9.
Try it the OS X way — with windows opening “in place” so that you
avoid window clutter. Press Ô before double-clicking to force a
folder to open in a new window. I’ve learned to love this new way,
although I hated it at first. Now, between this feature and the
Column view, I rarely need more than two or three windows on-
screen, and I get by most of the time with just a single window in
Column view.
75
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

• Selecting the Open new windows in Column View check box tells
the Finder that you want each window to be in Column view when
you double-click or (Ô double-click) to open it. The default behav-
ior is to use whichever view type the folder was last displaying.
• The Labels pane lets you rename the colored labels that appear in
the File menu. The default names are the same as their color, but
you can change them to anything you like, as shown in Figure 3-15.
• The Sidebar pane lets you choose which items are displayed in the
Sidebar, as shown in Figure 3-15. Check the check box to display
the item; uncheck the checkbox to not display it.
• Finally, in the Advanced pane, the Show Warning before Emptying
the Trash check box (on by default) allows you to turn off the nag-
ging dialog telling you how many items are in the Trash and asking
whether you really want to delete them.
• Finally, selecting the Always Show File Extensions check box 
tells the Finder to display the little three-, four-, or more-character
Figure 3-15:
Set Finder

76
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

filename suffixes (like .doc in summary.doc) that make your Mac’s
file lists look more like those of a Windows user. The Finder hides
those from you by default, but if you want to be able to search for
files by their extension (Using File➪Find or Ô+F), you need to turn
this on.
 Empty Trash: Deletes all items in the Trash from your hard drive —
period. I talked about the Trash in Chapter 2.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: Use this command with a modicum
of caution. After a file is trashed and the Trash is emptied, it’s gone. (Okay,
maybe Norton Utilities can bring it back, but don’t bet the farm on it.)
 Secure Empty Trash: Choosing this option makes the chance of recov-
ery by even the most ardent hacker or expensive disk recovery tool diffi-
cult to virtually impossible. Now, the portion of the disk that held the
files you’re deleting will be overwritten 1, 7, or 35 times (your choice in
the submenu) with randomly generated gibberish.
 Services: One of the really cool features of OS X applications is the
accessibility of Services. You can select an e-mail address and create a
mail message addressed to that individual, spell-check a document or
selection even if the program didn’t come with a spell-checker, or calcu-
late exchange rates on currency. Unfortunately, many applications still
don’t support Services.
Carbon is an Apple API (Application Program Interface): programming
technology that allows software developers to make applications origi-
nally created for OS 9 run in OS X with a minimum of modification. Some
(but not all) Carbon applications run under both OS 9 and OS X. 
Programs written exclusively for OS X that use Apple’s latest generation
of development tools are called Cocoa applications. Cocoa apps support
OS X features such as Services automatically, unless the developer goes
out of his or her way to disable them (see iPhoto for an example). 
From your perspective, there’s little or no difference between Carbon
and Cocoa apps. Some Carbon apps are awesome; some Cocoa pro-
grams stink. It’s not about the underlying development environment or
APIs used.
But I digress yet again. Cocoa and Carbon are far beyond the scope of
this book, but at least I snuck in the extremely abridged version.
 Hide Finder (Ô+H): Use this command when you’ve got Finder windows
open and they’re distracting you. Choosing it makes the Finder inactive
(another currently running program becomes active) and hides any
open Finder windows. To make the Finder visible again, either choose
Show All from the Finder menu (or whatever it’s called in the active
application — the command should still be there) or click the Finder
button (shown in the margin here) on the Dock.
77
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

The advantage to hiding the Finder — rather than closing or minimizing
all your windows to get a clean screen — is that you don’t have to open
them all again when you’re ready to get the windows back. Instead, just
choose Show All or click the Finder button in the Dock.
 Hide Others (Option+Ô+H): This command hides all windows
associated with all running programs except the active program. It
appears in most application’s Application menus and is good for hiding
distractions so you can focus on one thing — the unhidden application.
 Show All: Use this as the antidote to both of the Hide commands.
Choose this, and nothing is hidden anymore.
File Management and More: 
Meet the File Menu
The File menu contains many commands that you use to manipulate your
files and folders. I discuss file management in Chapter 6, but here I give you
the lowdown on the actual Finder File menu itself.
78
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger
Spring-loaded folders have sprung (again)
Spring-loaded folders and windows let you drag
items onto closed folders or disks and have them
spring open. It’s harder to describe than to do, so
try it a few times. Open Finder Preferences, mark
the Spring-loaded Folders and Windows check
box, and then follow these steps:
1. Select any icon (except a disk icon).
2. Drag it onto a folder or disk icon (but don’t
release the mouse button).
3. Press the spacebar (or just wait a few sec-
onds depending on where you’ve set the
Delay slider).
The window of the folder or disk that you
dragged onto springs open. If that’s the original
icon’s final destination, release the mouse button
now. Or, if you want to drill down deeper into the
folder hierarchy, don’t release the mouse button
and drag the icon onto any folder or disk icon. Its
window will spring open. And so on.
Spring-loaded folders clean up after themselves,
too. When you release the mouse button, regard-
less of how many windows you’ve traversed, all
windows except the original (if there was one; if
you dragged an icon from the Desktop, there
wouldn’t be) and the destination folder spring
shut again, leaving your screen clean and
uncluttered. Spring-loaded folders work in all
three Finder window views and also with folder
or disk icons in the Sidebar. Neat! If you’re like
me, you’ll end up using spring-loaded folders 
a lot.

You’ll use these commands frequently, so it would behoove you to memorize
their keyboard shortcuts.
 New Finder Window (Ô+N): Opens a new Finder window.
 New Folder (Ô+Shift+N): Creates a new, untitled folder in the active
window. If no window is active, it creates a new, untitled folder on the
Desktop.
 Open (Ô+O): Opens the selected item, be it icon, window, or folder.
 Open With: Lets you open the selected document with an application
other than that document’s default application. For example, in Figure
3-16, I’m about to open a graphic file. The default application for this
document happens to be Apple’s multipurpose document viewer,
Preview.
If I double-click this document, it would open in the default application,
Preview. But that’s not what I want. I want it to open it in QuickTime
Player so I can copy and paste it into a movie I’m making. This menu
item tells the Finder to do just that.
This command is inactive if the selected icon isn’t a document.
Using this menu item from the Contextual menu (Control+click the doc-
ument icon) or even the Finder toolbar’s Action popup button is often
easier than it is to reach all the way up to the menu bar to invoke it, as
shown in Figure 3-17. With my two-button mouse (as described earlier),
it’s just right-click-and-drag ’em in one quick motion.
If you hold down the Option key before you click the File menu, the
Open With command changes to Always Open With, as shown in Figure
3-18, which enables you to change the default application for this docu-
ment permanently.
Figure 3-16:

with an
application
other than
its default.
79
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

This Option key trick also works on the contextual menu version of this
command — just hold down the Option key after you Control-click the
document. 
 Close Window (Ô+W): Closes the active window. If no windows are open
or if none are selected, the Close Window command is grayed out and
can’t be chosen.
Most menu commands are intuitive. So how did Apple come up with
Ô+W as a shortcut for Close Window? You think Apple would assign the
letter C, for Close. However, Ô+C is the shortcut for Copy.

80
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

If you also press Option, the Close Window command changes to Close
All. This very useful command enables you to close all open Finder win-
dows. But it only shows up when you press the Option key; otherwise, it
remains hidden. 
 Get Info (Ô+I): Opens an Info window for the selected icon. (I told you
about the Info window in Chapter 2.)
If you hold down Option, the Get Info command changes to Show
Inspector. The Inspector window is almost identical to a Get Info window,
but it displays information for whatever icon is currently selected in the
Finder. If you click a different icon, the Inspector window updates to show
you information about that item. A Get Info window, on the other hand, is
associated with exactly one icon or a set of selected icons — you can have
multiple Get Info windows on screen simultaneously but there’s always
only one Inspector window. Got it? If not, play with your Get Info and
Inspector windows until you do.
It’s good to have choices; sometimes one is more convenient to use for a
particular task than the other, and sometimes you use them both.
 Duplicate (Ô+D): Makes a copy of the selected icon, adds the word copy
to its name, and then places the copy in the same window as the original
icon. You can use the Duplicate command on any icon except a disk icon.
You can’t duplicate an entire disk onto itself. But you can copy an entire
disk (call it Disk 1) to any other disk (call it Disk 2), as long as Disk 2 has
enough space available. Just hold down Option and drag Disk 1 onto
Disk 2’s icon. The contents of Disk 1 will be copied to Disk 2 and will
appear in a folder named Disk 1.
 Make Alias (Ô+L): Creates an alias for the selected icon in the same
folder as the selected icon (or on the Desktop if the selected icon is on
the Desktop). I covered aliases in detail in Chapter 2.
 Show Original (Ô+R): Displays the folder that contains the parent icon.
Suppose that you make and use an alias, you put it on your Desktop or
in your Favorites folder, and everything’s peachy. But now you want to
delete or move the original file or folder as part of a little spring-cleaning.
Where is that original? You’ve been using the alias so long that you can’t
remember. To find it, click the alias and then choose File➪Show Original
or use the keyboard shortcut, Ô+R. Quick as a flash, the folder that con-
tains the parent icon appears so you can delete, copy, move, or do any-
thing you like with the parent icon.
This command, of course, is available only when an alias icon is selected.
 Add to Sidebar (Ô+T): Adds the selected item to the Sidebar. You can
now reach the item by clicking it in any Finder window’s Sidebar. 
81
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

 Create Archive: Creates a compressed .zip file out of your selection. The
compressed file will be smaller than the original, sometimes by quite a bit. 
If you’re going to send a file or files as an e-mail enclosure, creating an
archive of the file(s) first and sending the archive instead of the original
will save you time sending the file and save the recipient time download-
ing it.
 Move to Trash (Ô+Delete): Moves the selected icon to the Trash.
The icon (that is, the item that the icon represents) that you move to the
Trash is not deleted from your hard drive until you choose the Empty
Trash or Secure Empty Trash command from the Finder menu, the Trash
pop-up menu, the Finder window’s Action pop-up menu, or the contex-
tual menu.
 Eject (Ô+E): Ejects the selected removable disk (such as a CD, DVD,
floppy, or Zip).
 Burn Disc: Burns data to a CD or DVD. If you have a compatible CD-RW
or DVD-R drive and you’ve prepared the media, choosing this command
tells the Finder to finish the job and actually burn the data to the CD or
DVD. I cover burning CDs and DVDs in Chapter 7.
 Find (Ô+F): Finds a file or folder on your hard drive. Use the File➪Find
command when you can’t remember where you put it in a file or folder.
This command kicks some butt; I’ll discuss it in detail in Chapter 6.
 Color Label: Lets you apply a colored label to any icon. You select the
icon and then choose a color with this menu item. 
The Color Label item also appears on the Contextual (Control+Click)
Menu; it’s often easier to use it instead of the File menu.
The Edit Menu (Which Shoulda Been
Called the Clipboard Menu)
In contrast to the File menu, which has commands that mostly deal with file
management and are exclusive to the Finder window, the Edit menu’s com-
mands and functions are available in almost every Macintosh program ever
made.
Because almost every program has an Edit menu and because almost every
program uses the same keyboard shortcuts on its Edit menu, it behooves you
to know the Edit menu keyboard shortcuts by heart, even if you remember
no others.
82
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

With Mac OS X version 10.1, Apple added one of the few features that people
really like about Windows — using the Copy and Paste commands to copy
files from one location to another. Before that, Copy and Paste only worked
with selected text; you couldn’t use Copy and Paste with icons at all.
Comprehending the Clipboard
The Clipboard is a holding area for the last thing that you cut or copied. That
copied item can be text, a picture, a portion of a picture, an object in a draw-
ing program, a column of numbers in a spreadsheet, or just about anything
that can be selected. In other words, the Clipboard is the Mac’s temporary
storage area.
The Clipboard commands in the Edit menu are enabled only when they can
actually be used. If the currently selected item can be cut or copied, the Cut
and Copy commands in the Edit menu are enabled. If the selected item can’t
be cut or copied, the commands are unavailable and are dimmed (gray). And
when nothing is selected, the Cut, Copy, Paste, and Clear commands are also
dimmed.
Copying or cutting to the Clipboard
To cut or copy something to the Clipboard, select the item and then choose
Cut or Copy from the Edit menu or use the keyboard shortcuts Ô+X (cut) 
or Ô+C (copy). Choosing Cut deletes the selected item and puts it on the
Clipboard; choosing Copy copies the selected item to the clipboard but does
not delete the selected item.
You can cut an icon’s name but you can’t cut the icon itself; you may only
copy an icon.
To achieve the effect of cutting an icon, select the icon, Copy it to the Clip-
board, move the original icon to the Trash, and Paste the icon in its new 
location.
As a storage area, the Clipboard’s contents are temporary. Very temporary.
When you cut or copy an item, that item remains on the Clipboard only until
you cut or copy something else. When you do cut or copy something else,
the new item replaces the Clipboard’s contents and in turn remains on the
Clipboard until you cut or copy something else. And so it goes.
Of course, whatever’s on the Clipboard heads straight for oblivion if you
crash, lose power, log out, or shut your Mac down, so don’t count on it too
heavily or for too long.
83
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

Pasting from the Clipboard
To place the item that’s on the Clipboard someplace new, click where you
want the item to go and then paste what you’ve copied or cut (choose Edit➪
Paste or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+V). Pasting does not remove the item
from the Clipboard; the item remains there until you cut or copy another item.
Pasting doesn’t purge the contents of the Clipboard. In fact, an item stays on
the Clipboard until you cut, copy, clear, crash (these used to be the four Cs 
of Macintosh computing, but Mac OS X almost never crashes), restart, shut
down, or log out. This means that you can paste the same item over and over
and over again, which can come in pretty handy at times.
Almost all programs have an Edit menu and use the Macintosh Clipboard,
which means you can usually cut or copy something from a document in one
program and paste it into a document in another program. 
Usually.
Checking out the main Edit menu items
The previous sections give you probably 75 percent of what you need to know
about the Edit menu. Still, because I get paid to be thorough and because the
Finder’s Edit menu has a few commands that aren’t Clipboard-related, in this
section, I go through the Edit menu’s commands one by one.
 Undo/Redo (Ô+Z): This command undoes the last thing you did. For
example, if you change the name of a folder and then choose this com-
mand, the name of the folder reverts back to what it was before you
changed it. The Undo or Redo command is followed by the name of the
action you’re about to undo or redo.
The Undo command toggles (that is, switches back and forth) between
the new and old states as long as you don’t do anything else. For exam-
ple, if you rename a file from Do Me to Undo Me and then choose Edit➪
Undo, the file name reverts to Do Me. If you pull down the Edit menu
now, the Undo command reads Redo instead of Undo. Select Redo, and
the name of the file changes back to Undo Me. You can continue to Undo
and Redo until you click somewhere else. 
Don’t forget about this command because it can be a lifesaver. Almost
every program has an Undo command. Now for the bad news: The Undo
command is ephemeral, like the Clipboard: You can only use Undo to
reverse your last action. As soon as you do something else — even just
clicking a lousy icon — you lose the ability to undo the original action. At
least, this is true in the Finder. Some programs, such as Microsoft Word,
BBEdit, iMovie, and Adobe Illustrator, allow multiple Undo operations.
84
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

Here’s a cool feature introduced in Mac OS X 10.3 Panther — the Undo
command works with certain actions that it never worked with before,
such as moving icons. That’s way cool because sometimes you drag an
icon somewhere and drop it accidentally. Finding it used to be a hassle;
now you can just undo the move. Kewl beans.
As you find out more about your Mac and OS X, you’ll no doubt discover
actions that you can’t undo. Still, Undo is a great command when avail-
able, and I urge you to get in the habit of trying it often.
 Cut (Ô+X): This command removes the selected item and places it on the
Clipboard. You can then paste the item from the Clipboard to another doc-
ument, text box, or other valid destination. For more info on Cut and the
Clipboard, see the earlier section “Copying or cutting to the Clipboard.”
 Copy (Ô+C): This command makes a copy of a selected item and places
it on the Clipboard. However, the original is not removed like it is when
you cut something. For more info on Copy and the Clipboard, see the
earlier section “Copying or cutting to the Clipboard.”
 Paste (Ô+V): This command places the contents of the Clipboard at the
place you last clicked. For more info on Paste and the Clipboard, see the
earlier section “Pasting from the Clipboard.”
 Select All (Ô+A): This command selects all icons in the active window.
Or, if no window is active, using Select All selects every icon on the
Desktop. If a window is active, choosing Select All selects every icon in
the window, regardless of whether you can see them onscreen.
 Show Clipboard: This command summons the Clipboard window, which
lists the type of item (such as text, picture, or sound) on the Clipboard
and a message letting you know whether the item on the Clipboard can
be displayed.
 Special Characters: This command opens the Character Palette, where
you can choose special characters such as mathematical symbols,
arrows, ornaments, stars, accented Latin characters, and so on. To
insert a character into your document at the insertion point, simply

The View menu controls what the icons and windows look like, how icons
and windows are arranged and sorted, and the look of your windows. The
View menu affects the icons in the active window; if no window is active, it
affects the icons on the Desktop.
85
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

The following list gives you a brief description of each of the menu items on
the View menu:
 As Icons (Ô+1): Using Icon view is the traditional Macintosh view — the
one most closely associated with the Macintosh experience. In my humble
opinion, however, this view is one of the two least useful views; those
big icons take up far too much valuable screen real estate. (I discuss
Icon view in Chapter 4.)
 As List (Ô+2): In List view, you can copy or move items from different
folders with a single motion without opening multiple windows. In either
Icon view or Columns view, on the other hand, moving files from two or
more different folders can require opening several windows and two sep-
arate drags or the use of Copy and Paste introduced in version 10.1.
 As Columns (Ô+3): This changes the active window to Columns view.
Choosing Columns view is a new way (added in Mac OS X) to view your
files in a Finder window where the folders on your computer are dis-
played in a column at the left of the Finder window’s Browser pane and
the contents of those folders are displayed in columns to the right. See
Chapter 4 for more info on Columns view.
 Clean Up: Choose this to align icons to an invisible grid; you use it to
keep your windows and Desktop neat and tidy. (If you like this invisible
grid, don’t forget that you can turn it on or off for the Desktop and indi-
vidual windows by using View Options.) Clean Up is available only in
Icon view or when no windows are active. If no windows are active, the
command instead cleans up your Desktop. (To deactivate all open win-
dows, just click anywhere on the Desktop.)
If you’re like me, you’ve taken great pains to place icons carefully in spe-
cific places on your Desktop. Cleaning up your Desktop destroys all your
beautiful work and moves all your perfectly arranged icons. And alas,
cleaning up your Desktop is not something you can undo.
 Arrange: This rearranges the icons in the active window in your choice
of six different ways: alphabetical order (by Name); modification date
(by Date Modified); creation date (by Date Created); Size; Kind; or Label.
Like Clean Up, it’s only available for windows viewed as icons, and it’s
not undo-able.
 Hide/Show Toolbar (Ô+Option+T): This shows or hides the buttons 
on the toolbar of the active window. Suppose that you want to see more
files and fewer buttons. Because the buttons on this toolbar are also
available from the Go menu (see the next section “Going Places”), and
the Action button’s popup menu is just whatever contextual menu goes
with your current selection, you’re safe in hiding them. Just choose Hide
Toolbar to make the toolbar go away or Show Toolbar to bring it back.
(As I detail in Chapter 5, the gray oval button in the upper-right corner
86
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

of every Finder window does the same thing.) The only thing you lose is
the Search box, and you can use Find for that if you want.
What they don’t tell you ahead of time (but I will) is that hiding the tool-
bar also hides the Sidebar. As I mentioned previously in one of my rants,
I find this quite annoying because I use the Sidebar a lot, but don’t use
the toolbar nearly as often (there are keyboard equivalents for all of
them).
When the toolbar is hidden, opening a folder opens a new Finder window
rather than reusing the current one (which is what happens when the
toolbar is showing unless you’ve changed this preference in Finder
Preferences or are using Column view). Go to Chapter 4 for more about
the toolbar in Finder windows.
 Customize Toolbar: This one is way cool — use it to design your 
own Finder window toolbar. Find out more about this nifty feature 
in Chapter 4.
 Hide/Show Status Bar: Shows or hides the status bar for Finder win-
dows, at the bottom of the window. The status bar tells you how many
items are in each window and, if any are selected, how many you’ve
selected out of the total, and how much space is available on the hard
drive containing this window.
 Show View Options (Ô+J): Here’s where you can soup up the way any
window looks and behaves. You can do this either globally (so that all
windows use the same view when opened) or on a window-by-window
basis. I discuss Show View Options more in Chapter 4.
Going Places: Checking 
Out Go Menu Items
The Go menu is chock-full of shortcuts. The items on this menu take you to
places on your Mac — many of the same places that you can go with the
Finder window toolbar — and a few other places.
The following list gives you a brief look at the items on the Go menu.
See the next section for info on some menu items that aren’t listed here, such
as Computer, Home, iDisk, and Favorites.
 Back (Ô+[): Use this menu option to return to the last Finder window
that you had open. It’s equivalent to the Back button in the Finder tool-
bar, in case you have the toolbar hidden.
87
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

Think of this command as a breadcrumb trail that moves backward
through every folder you open. For example, suppose that you open
seven folders to get to the destination folder that you desire — call them
folders 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Each time that you select the Back com-
mand, the previous folder appears — 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1.
 Forward (Ô+]): This is the opposite of using the Back command, moving
you forward through every folder you open. Picking up from the previous
example, suppose that you’ve moved back to folder 1. Each time you select
the Forward command, you move forward through those folders — 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, and 7. If you haven’t gone back, you can’t go forward.
 Enclosing Folder (Ô+up arrow {↑}): This command tells the Finder
window to display the folder where the currently selected item is located.
 Computer (Ô+Shift+C): This command tells the Finder window to dis-
play the Computer level, showing Network and all of your disks.
 Home (Ô+Shift+H): Use this command to have the Finder window dis-
play your Home directory (which is named with your short name).
 Network (Ô+Shift+K): This command displays whatever is accessible on
your network in the Finder window.
 iDisk: Use this submenu to mount your iDisk (Ô+Shift+I), another user’s
iDisk, or another user’s iDisk Public Folder.
 Applications (Ô+Shift+A): This command positions the Finder window
to your Applications directory, the usual storehouse for all the programs
that came with your Mac (and the most likely place that the programs
you install will be placed).
 Utilities (Ô+Shift+U): This command gets you to the Utilities folder
inside the Applications folder in one fell swoop. The Utilities folder is
the repository of such useful items as Disk Utility (which lets you erase,
format, verify, and repair disks) and Disk Copy (which you use to create
and mount disk-image files).
 Recent Folders: Use this submenu to quickly go back to a folder that
you recently visited. Every time you open a folder, Mac OS X creates an
alias to it and stores it in the Recent Folders folder. You can open any of
these aliases from the Recent Folders command in the Go menu.
 Go to Folder (Ô+Shift+G): This summons the Go to Folder dialog, as
shown in Figure 3-19. Look at your Desktop. Maybe it’s cluttered with
lots of windows, or maybe it’s completely empty. Either way, suppose
you’re several clicks away from a folder that you want to open. If you
know the path from your hard drive to that folder, you can type the path
to the folder that you want in the Go to the Folder text box (separating
88
Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

each folder name with a forward slash [/]) and then click Go to move
(relatively) quickly to the folder that you need.
The first character you type must also be a forward slash, as shown 
in Figure 3-19, unless you’re going to a subdirectory of the current
window.
This particular window is clairvoyant; it tries to guess which folder you
mean by the first letter or two that you type. For example, in Figure 3-19,
I typed the letter A and paused, and the window guessed that I wanted
Applications; then I pressed the right-arrow key to accept the guess and
typed a U, and the window guessed the rest (tilities) and filled it in for
me. (The final letters I didn’t type are highlighted in Figure 3-19).
 Connect to Server (Ô+K): If your Mac is connected to a network or to
the Internet, use this command to reach these remote resources.
Window Dressing
Again with the windows! I already spent plenty of pages giving you the scoop
on how to work with windows. But wait; there’s more . . . the commands on
the Window menu provide you with tools that you can use to manage your
windows. Here is a brief look at each of the menu items on the Window menu.
 Minimize Window (Ô+M): Use this command to unclutter your Desktop.
It’s the same as clicking the orange gumdrop.
With a Finder window selected (the command will be unavailable —
grayed out — if you don’t have an active Finder window), using the
Minimize Window command makes the window disappear, as it were: The
file or folder is still open, but it’s not active, and you don’t see it on your
screen. You do see, however, an icon representing it in the Dock. (Read
all about the Dock in Chapter 2.)
Figure 3-19:

folder by

path.
89
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

 Bring All to Front: In previous versions of Mac OS, when you clicked a
window belonging to an application, all that application’s windows came
to the front. That is, windows moved within layers and as layers. Under
OS X, windows interleave. For example, you could have a Finder window,
a Word window, a Photoshop window, a Word window, and another
Finder window in a front-to-back order. Choosing Bring All to Front
enables you to have all the Finder windows move to the front of those
belonging to other applications (while keeping their own relative order-
ing). What you get is an emulation of the layering to which Mac (and
Windows) users are accustomed.
If you want to bring the all windows belonging to the Finder (or any
other program, for that matter) to the front at once you can also click
the application’s Dock icon.
If you hold down the Option key when you pull down the Window menu,
the Minimize Window changes to the Minimize All Windows, and the
Bring All to Front command changes to the useful Arrange in Front,
which arranges all your Desktop windows neatly — starting in the upper-
left corner of the Desktop, as shown in Figure 3-20.
Figure 3-20:

in Front

Part I: Introducing Mac OS X Tiger

 Other items: The remaining items on the Window menu are the names of
all currently open Finder windows. Click a window’s name to bring it to
the front.
The names of windows that you minimize (the ones with icons appear-
ing on the Dock) remain on the Window menu. You can view the window
by choosing its name from the Window menu.
Not Just a Beatles Movie: 
Help and the Help Menu
One of the best features about all Macs since System 7.x is the system’s 
excellent built-in help. And Mac OS X doesn’t cheat you on that legacy: This
system has online help in abundance. When you have a question about how
to do something, the Mac Help Center is the first place you should visit (after
this book, of course).
The sole item in the Help menu — Mac Help (Ô+?) — opens the Mac Help
window, as shown in Figure 3-21.
Figure 3-21:
Mac Help is
nothing if
not helpful.
91
Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus

The one exception to the rule I mention earlier in this chapter — that you don’t
have to press Shift for capital letters in a keyboard shortcut on a menu — is
the keyboard shortcut for Help. This shortcut appears on the Help menu as
Ô+?, and you do have to hold down the Shift key to type the question mark.
In fact, if you press Ô+/ (the Command key and a front slash, which is what
you get when you type a lowercase question mark), nothing happens. This
result is different from what you’d get from earlier versions of Mac OS.
In other words, the shortcut for Help should be Ô+Shift+/ even though the
menu says Ô+?. Got it? If you’re wondering why this is, Apple says it’s because
you’re going to be asking questions, and the question mark is a great device
for remembering that. It’s the same way for other non-alphabetic keys used in
shortcuts. Personally, I think it’s lame — it should work one way or the other
all the time.
To use Mac Help, simply type a word or phrase into the text field at the top
right and then press Enter or Return. In a few seconds, your Mac provides
you with one or more articles to read, which (theoretically) are related your
question. Usually. For example, if you type menus and press Return, you get
more than 50 different help articles, as shown in Figure 3-22.

Chapter 3: About Windows (Not the Microsoft Kind) and Menus
More menus 4 U
If you like the menus you’ve seen so far, have I got a treat for you: Mac OS X Tiger includes 23 addi-
tional special-purpose menus, known as Menu Extras, that you can install if you like. Some, includ-
ing Sound, Displays, Battery, and others, can be enabled from the appropriate System Preferences
pane (more on this in Chapter 13). But the easiest way is to open the Menu Extras folder
(/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras) and double-click each Menu Extra you want to install. 
Here are the contents of the Menu Extras folder:
And here are a handful of Menu Extras installed in the menu bar:
If you install a Menu Extra and later decide you don’t need or want it in your menu bar, hold down
the Ô key and drag it off the menu bar; it’ll disappear with a satisfying “poof.”
Battery
Displays
Sound
Clock
User
AirPort
Eject
iChat
iSync

Although you don’t have to be connected to the Internet to use Mac Help,
you do need an Internet connection to get the most out of it. That’s because
OS X installs only certain help articles on your hard drive. If you ask a ques-
tion that those articles don’t answer, Mac Help will connect to Apple’s Web
site and download the answer (assuming that you have an active Internet
connection). These answers are the “results from product support,” denoted
by a plus sign and underlined text, as shown in the lower part of the window
in Figure 3-22. Click one and Help Viewer retrieves the text over the Internet.
While this can sometimes be inconvenient, it’s also quite smart. This way, the
help system can be updated at any time by Apple without requiring any
action from you.
Furthermore, after you’ve asked a question and Mac Help has grabbed the
answer from the Apple Web site, the answer remains on your hard drive for-
ever. If you ask for it again (even in a later date), your computer won’t have
to download it from the Apple Web site again.

elieve it or not, all the stuff on your Mac can fit in one window — the
Finder window. In this window, you can double-click your way to your
favorite application, your documents, or out onto the Internet. In fact, the
Finder is the place you are when you haven’t yet gone any place at all. The
Finder window appears on the Desktop when you start up your Mac, and it’s
always available. And if you close the Finder, you can get it back easily. Even
if you’re an old hand with Mac OS, I show you how to get the most from the
OS X Finder in this chapter.
The Finder is, among other things, a window. A very talented window, but a
window just the same. (For the lowdown on windows in general, see 
Chapter 3.)
Getting to Know the Finder
A Finder window is a handy friend. And the Finder is indeed a window (or
multiple windows) in OS X. Use the Finder to navigate through files, folders,
and applications on your hard drive — or to connect to other Macs and
Internet servers — right from your Desktop.
Figure 4-1 shows a typical Finder window, with all the standard features high-
lighted.

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 
Hey, I know you!
If you’re an experienced Mac user, you know
the Finder well. Every version of Mac OS before
Max OS X has included a Finder, and its appear-
ance has been pretty much the same since the
Mac was introduced in 1984. What’s new in the
Mac OS X Finder is that you can use a single
window instead of multiple windows if you like.
Imagine using a single window to display just
about everything stored on all your hard drives
and removable disks. Instead of opening a new
window for each folder or disk, the Mac OS X
Finder can display everything in the same
window, shifting your view of items as you click
or select them with buttons in the window. 
If you liked it the old way and prefer multiple
Finder windows onscreen, you can tell your
Mac to give you what you want temporarily or
permanently. To open a folder or disk in a new
window just this once, merely hold down the Ô
key when you double-click the folder or disk and
it will open in a new window. To make that the
default behavior for your Finder, set your Finder
Preferences (in the Finder menu) to open a new
window when you double-click a folder.
Note: If you’ve hidden the toolbar by clicking a
Finder window’s Hide/Show Toolbar button,
new windows open automatically when you
open a folder — you don’t have to hold down
the Ô key at all.
This can be quite disconcerting. All of a sudden
Finder windows behave differently as a result of

Belly Up to the Bar(s): 
The Toolbar and Sidebar
Right below the title bar, you find the Finder window toolbar (refer to Figure
4-1). On it are tools and buttons that let you navigate quickly and act upon
selected icons. To activate a toolbar button, click it once.
You say you don’t want to see the toolbar at the top of the window? Okay!
Just choose View➪Hide Toolbar or click the little gray jelly bean-looking
thing in the upper-right corner of every Finder window, and it’s gone. (If only
life were always so easy!)
Alas, hiding the Toolbar also hides the useful Sidebar and Status Bar. If only
you could choose to hide them independently. . . .
If you’ve customized your toolbar, as you discover later in this chapter, it
won’t look exactly like this. But here’s the lowdown on the toolbar’s default
buttons, from left to right:
 Forward and Back buttons: Clicking the Forward and Back buttons dis-
plays the folders that you’ve viewed in this window in sequential order.
If you’ve used a Web browser, it’s a lot like that.
The keyboard shortcuts Ô+[ for Back and Ô+] for Forward are more
useful (in my opinion) than using the buttons. (For more on this nifty
navigation device, see the “Hither and yon: The Forward and Back but-
tons” section later in this chapter.)
 View buttons: The three view buttons change the way that the window
displays its contents. Stay tuned for an entire section on views coming
up in just a few pages.
 Action: Click this button to see a popup menu of all the context-sensitive
actions you can perform upon selected icons, as shown in Figure 4-2.
99
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder
your doing something totally unrelated — hiding
the Toolbar. 
One last thing: If you want to use the new one-
window approach on a window with its toolbar
hidden — or if you’ve set your Finder Pref-
erences to open folders in a new window —
just hold down the Option key when you double-
click a folder or disk. It closes the current
window and opens the new window as if you
had never hidden the toolbar or changed the
Finder preference setting.

 Search: The toolbar’s Search box is a nifty way to search for files. Just
type a word or even just a few letters and after a few seconds, the
window will fill with a list of files that match, as shown in Figure 4-3.

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 
Finding the Finder
If you don’t see a Finder window on the Desktop
when your Mac finishes the start-up process,
you probably closed it the last time that the Mac
was on. So how do you find the Finder window
again?
 Click the Finder icon in the Dock. (It’s the
one with a smiley blue Mac face on it.)
 Choose File➪New Finder window (or use
the keyboard shortcut Ô+N), and a Finder
window appears. New Finder windows
always open up showing your Home direc-
tory. In other words, they open up labeled
YourShortName, the same as if you
chose Go➪Home or clicked the Home
button in the Sidebar.
Note: In Finder Preferences, you can
change what is displayed when a New
Finder window opens — to your Home,
Computer, Documents folder, or any other
folder you choose.
You’ll probably open a lot of new windows,
so consider memorizing this keyboard
shortcut: Ô+N. This shortcut is good to
know because most software programs use
the Ô+N shortcut to create a new docu-
ment. If your memory is bad, use this
mnemonic device: N is for New.

The File➪Find command (shortcut: Ô+F), which used to open its own unique
search window, opens a special Finder window (as shown in Figure 4-3). The
cursor appears promptly (so to speak) in the Search box so you can begin
typing your search string immediately.
When you use this technique, you have a choice of where to search — Servers,
Computer (selected in Figure 4-3), Home, or Others — and then choose addi-
tional criteria (such as the Kind of file, last date the file was opened, modifi-
cation date, creation date, keywords, label, file contents, or size). To add a
criterion, click the + button on the right side of the window; to save a search
for reuse in the future, click the Save button on the right side of the window.
Navigating the Finder: Up, 
Down, and Backwards
In addition to the Sidebar described previously and some good old-fashioned
double-clicking, the Mac OS X Finder window offers additional navigation
aids — the current folder drop-down menu and the Back and Forward buttons. 
Like a roadmap: The current 
folder drop-down menu
In the center of the window’s title bar is the name of the folder that you’re
viewing in this window — the highlighted folder. To see a roadmap to this
folder from the top level, Ô+click and hold on the folder’s name (Desktop) in
the title bar, as shown in Figure 4-4.
Figure 4-3:
When the
toolbar’s
Search box
isn’t good
enough, use
the Find

101
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

A drop-down menu appears with the current folder (Desktop) at the top.
Select any folder in the menu, and it becomes the highlighted folder in the
current window; release the mouse button and that folder’s contents are 
displayed.
Put another way, in Figure 4-4, the contents of the Desktop folder are displayed
(actually, they would be displayed if there were any, but there aren’t). If I
released the mouse button, the contents of the highlighted folder (bobl)
would appear.
Use this pop-up menu to move from your current folder to the bottom folder,
which represents your computer (PowerBook TiGer in Figure 4-4). Now click
the Back button. Hey, you’re right back where you were before you touched
that pop-up menu.
If you like this feature a lot, use the Customize Toolbar command (in the View
menu) to add a Path button to your toolbar. It displays the menu of folders
previously described without having to hold down the Ô key.
To remove an item from the Toolbar, simply hold down the Ô key and drag it
out of the Toolbar. When you release the mouse button, the item will disap-
pear with a satisfying poof. This technique also works for removing items
from the Dock or Sidebar, but you don’t have to press the Ô key. Just drag
them out onto the desktop and poof!

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Hither and yon: The Forward 
and Back buttons
Suppose you’re fiddling around in a Finder window, opening stuff, and maybe
even looking for a particular file. You realize that the item you want is in the
folder you just left. D’oh! What to do? Click the Back button — yes, just like
the one on a Web browser. The Back button (shown on the left in the margin)
is the left-pointing arrow at the left end of the Finder window toolbar. If you
want to move to the last folder you were at, just click the Back button, and
there you are! If you use a Web browser (and who doesn’t these days?),
you’re probably a pro at this already.
Here’s an example of how the Back button works. Say you’re in your Home
folder, you click the Favorites button, and then a split-second later you real-
ize that you actually need something in the Home folder. Just a quick click of
the Back button and poof! You’re back Home.
As for the Forward button, well, it moves you the opposite direction through
folders that you’ve visited in this window.
Play around with them both — you’ll find them invaluable. And don’t forget
even more invaluable keyboard shortcuts — Ô+[ and Ô+] for Forward and
Back, respectively.
Customize Your Finder Windows
You have three ways to view a window — Column view, Icon view, and List
view. Some people like columns, some like icons, and others love lists. To
each her own. Play with the three Finder views to see which one works best
for you. For what it’s worth, I usually prefer Column view with a dash of List
view thrown in when I need a folder’s contents sorted by creation date or size.
The following sections give you a look at each view.
Column view
The Column view is my favorite way to display windows in the Finder.
To display a window in the Column view, click the Column view button in the
toolbar (as shown in the margin), choose View➪As Columns from the Finder’s
menu bar, or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+3.
103
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

You can have as many columns in a Column view window as your screen can
handle. Just use the window sizer (also known as the resize control) in the
lower-right corner to enlarge your window horizontally so new columns have
room to open. Or click the green Zoom (also known as Maximize) gumdrop to
expand the window to its maximum width instantly.
You can use the little grabber handles at the bottom of a column to resize the
column widths. When you drag this handle left or right, the column to its left
resizes; if you hold down the Option key when you drag, all the columns
resize at the same time. Furthermore, if you double-click one of these little
handles, the column to its left expands to the width of the widest item it con-
tains. And if you Option-double-click any handle, all the columns expand to
the width of the widest item at the same time.
See what a Finder window displayed in Column view looks like in Figure 4-5.
Here’s how it works: When I click the Tiger Disk icon in the Sidebar, its con-
tents appear in the column to the right. When I click the Applications folder
in this column, its contents appear in the second column. When I click the
Utilities folder in the second column, its contents appear in the third column.
When I click the Java folder in the third column, its contents appear in the
fourth column. Finally, when I click Java Web Start in the fourth column, a big
icon plus some information about this file appears (it’s an application, 1.3 MB
in size, created on 10/5/04, and so on).
This rightmost column displays information about the highlighted item to its
left, but only if that item is not a folder or disk. (If it were, its contents would
be in this column, right?) That’s the preview column. For most items, the pic-
ture is an enlarged view of the file’s icon, as shown in Figure 4-5. But if that
item is a graphic file (even a PDF) saved in a format that QuickTime can inter-
pret (most graphic file formats), a preview picture appears instead of an icon,
as shown in Figure 4-6. If you don’t like having the Preview displayed, you can
choose View➪Show View Options and turn off Show Preview Column.

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Column view is a darn handy way to quickly look through a lot of folders at
once, and is especially useful when those folders are filled with graphics files.
Icon view
Icon view is a free-form view that allows you to move your icons around
within a window to your heart’s content. Check out the Finder window in
Figure 4-1 to see what Icon view looks like.
To display a window in the Icon view, click the Icon view button in the toolbar
(as shown in the margin), choose View➪As Icons from the Finder’s menu bar,
or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+1.
List view
Finally, I come to the view that I loved and used most in Mac OS 9 (but use
much less often since the advent of the Column view): the List view (as
shown in Figure 4-7). The main reason why I liked it so much was the little tri-
angles to the left of each folder, known as disclosure triangles, which let you
see the contents of a folder without actually opening the folder. It also allows
you to select items from multiple folders at once. 
Figure 4-6:
The preview

file is a

instead of

105
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

To disclose a folder’s contents you merely click on the triangle to its left;
when you do, its contents are disclosed. In Figure 4-7, the Logs and
CrashReporter folders are disclosed.
To display a window in List view, click the List view button in the toolbar (as
shown in the margin), choose View➪As List from the Finder’s menu bar, or
use the keyboard shortcut Ô+2.
Now look at the little triangle at the right edge of the selected column; it’s the
Name column in Figure 4-7). If this little arrow points up, the items in the cor-
responding column sort in descending order; if you click the header (Name)
once, the arrow now points down and the items are listed in the opposite
(ascending) order, as shown in Figure 4-8. This behavior is true for all
columns in List-view windows.
To change the order in which columns appear in a window, press and hold on
a column’s name and then drag it to the left or right until it’s where you want
it. Release the mouse button, and the column moves.

Icon view: The ol’ stick-in-the-mud view
In all fairness, I must say that many perfectly
happy Macintosh users love Icon view and
refuse to even consider anything else. Fine. But
as the number of files on your hard drive
increases (as it does for every Mac user),
screen real estate becomes more and more
valuable. In my humble opinion, the only real
advantages that the Icon view has over the
Column or List views is the capability to arrange
the icons anywhere you like within the window,
and to put a background picture or color behind
your icons. Big deal.
I offer this solution as a compromise: If you still
want to see your files and folders in Icon view,
make them smaller so that more of them fit in
the same space on-screen.
To change the size of a window’s icons, choose
View➪Show View Options (or press Ô+J). In
the View Options window that appears, click the
This Window Only radio button. Drag the Icon
Size slider that you find there to the left. This
makes the icons in the active window smaller.
Conversely, you could make ’em all bigger by
dragging the Icon Size slider to the right. Bigger
icons make me crazy, but if you like them that
way, your Mac can accommodate you.
If you want to make the icons in every window
bigger or smaller, click the All Windows radio
button in the View Options window and drag the
Icon Size slider right or left. This affects all win-
dows displayed in Icon view. (Read more on the
View Options window coming up in a page or
two. . . .)
Note: If you like Icon view, consider purchasing
a larger monitor — I hear that monitors now
come in a 30-inch size.

Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

The exception to this (isn’t there always an exception?) is that the Name
column always appears first in List view windows; all other columns can be
moved about at will. And, in fact, you can even hide and show columns other
than Name if you like, as you’ll see in the Showing those View Options 
On Using View Options
The Finder is outrageously handy. It not only gives you convenient access to
multiple windows, but also offers ways to tweak what you see till you get
what works best for you.
To customize the way Finder windows look, you use the View Options window.
When you choose View➪Show View Options from the Finder menu bar (or
use the keyboard shortcut Ô+J), you see the View Options window, as shown
in Figure 4-9.
Start by selecting the All Windows radio button at the top of the View
Options window. Now, whatever choices you set in this window affect all
Finder windows for which you haven’t specified explicit options (which you
do with the This Window Only radio button, which I get to in a moment).
First decide whether you want to modify the Icon, List, or Column view by
displaying the window in that view. Here’s the deal:
 If you choose Icon view, your options apply to all windows in Icon view
 If you choose List view, your choices apply to all windows in List view.
Figure 4-9:

108
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

 Because there are no This Window Only choices for Column view, your
choices in View Options for Column view always apply to all Column
view windows.
The choice that you make determines what options you see in the View
Options window. The following sections describe your choices.
Icon view options
So you just can’t kick that icon habit, eh? Okay . . . here’s how to make global
settings so all your windows use the Icon view. (If this concept excites you,
you really need to get out of the house more!)
In the window, select the All Windows radio button. Now you can set how big
you want your icons, how to arrange them in windows, and whether you
want to insert a picture as a background for your folder windows (yup, all
folders) or make the background color something other than white.
The following list describes the View Options that you see after you choose
Icon view:
 Icon Size: Use the Icon Size slider to make icons larger or smaller. To
save valuable screen-real-estate space, I recommend keeping your icons
small. The largest icon size is nothing short of huge.
Have a Finder window open in which icons are visible as you move the
slider, so you can monitor the icons’ size as they shrink or grow, depend-
ing on how far you move the slider.
 Text Size: What it says . . . the size of the icon’s name. Just choose the
point size that you want from the popup menu here.
 Label Position: Select either the Bottom or the Right radio button here
to set where the icon’s name appears — below it or to its right.
 Icon Arrangement: Okay, it doesn’t label this group of check boxes, but
icon arrangement is what they do. Here you specify whether those icons
should be penned up or free-range with these check boxes:
• Snap to Grid: Creates nice, straight lines of icons.
• Show Item Info: Adds a line of text below the icon’s name with info
about the file (or folder).
• Show Icon Preview: Got me. Nobody I know has figured this one
out yet. It doesn’t seem to do anything. If you know what it does,
please let me know.
• Keep Arranged By: Lets you specify the sort order for your icons
from the pop-up menu below. Your choices are Name, Date
Modified, Date Created, Size, and Kind.
109
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

 Background: From this list of radio buttons, you can pick a color or pic-
ture for your windows or opt for none at all (white, the default). Look at
Figure 4-10 to see what a folder looks like with a picture in its back-
ground. I’m not sure that windows should have pictures in their back-
grounds, but if you like them, this is how it’s done.
Whatever you choose — insert a picture, choose a color, or neither —
appears in each of your windows if you’ve chosen the All Windows radio
button in the View Options window.
List view options
Suppose you prefer List view (instead of Icon view) and want to set global
options for viewing your items this way. With your Finder window in List
view, choose View➪Show View Options from the Finder menu bar, and then
select the All Windows radio button from the View Options window that
appears. In Figure 4-11, you see a cluster of check boxes beneath the Show
Columns heading. (These are the ones I was talking about a few paragraphs
ago.) Check the ones you want to appear in all your List view windows.
Most of the options here tell Mac OS X which fields to display or hide. The
choices depend on what information you want displayed, such as
 Date modified
 Date created
 Size
 Kind
Figure 4-10:
All windows

rock-band

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

 Version
 Comments
 Labels
Select the ones you want to see, and then decide whether you like the view
you selected. You can always change your selections later if you find you
aren’t using a particular field.
The first three — modification date, creation date, and size — can be useful if
you want to sort the items by something other than name.
Here are two more options that may prove useful. Near the bottom of this
window are these two check boxes:
 Use Relative Dates: Select this check box, and Mac OS X intelligently
substitutes relative word equivalents — such as yesterday or today — for
numerical dates.
When you set your clock back a day and look at files that you updated
that day before setting your clock back, the relative date reads tomorrow.
(Curious but true.)
 Calculate All Sizes: Selecting this check box instructs Mac OS X to (yup)
calculate all sizes. Select this view to see how much stuff is in each
folder when you look at it in List view. The items (including folders) in
the active window are sorted in descending order from biggest to small-
est when you sort by size.
If you don’t select the Calculate All Sizes check box, items other than
folders are sorted by size, with all folders — regardless of their size —
appearing at the bottom of the list (or top, if the sort order is ascending).
Figure 4-11:
Choose
which fields

List view.
111
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

Near the top of the View Options dialog, you find the Icon Size radio buttons.
Select from these two radio buttons to choose between small and large icons
in your List views. For my money, I think the smallest ones make windows
appear noticeably faster — and they definitely allow more items to be shown.
(Your mileage may vary.)
One more thing: Spring-loaded folders were resurrected in OS X version 10.2
Jaguar. They work in all the views and with icons in the toolbar.
If you were among the millions who requested that Apple bring them back,
I’m happy to report that Apple did and that OS X’s spring-loaded folders are
better than ever. I’ll show you why they’re so cool in Chapter 6.
Making It Your Very Own Finder:
Introducing Finder Preferences
Another way to customize your Finder to choose Finder➪Finder Preferences
(or use the keyboard shortcut, Ô+comma). The Finder Preferences window
has four panes — General, Labels, Sidebar, and Advanced — as shown in
Figure 4-12.
112
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 
Being really finicky and choosing 
your views window by window
Perhaps choosing a global look for your Finder
windows is just too big of a commitment for you,
or you have a setup that you like but need a spe-
cial view for a particular window. Here’s how to
adjust your window view settings individually.
1. Open the window that you want to set up.
2. Choose View➪Show View Options from
the menu bar.
3. Select the This Window Only radio button
in the View Options window.
4. Choose View➪As List or View➪As Icons to
get the view that you want to set.
The options are conveniently the same as
the global options that I describe earlier, so
have at it and make this special window
look just the way you like it.

Using the General pane
The General pane starts off with a series of Show These Items on the Desktop
check boxes, which let you hide or show hard disks, CDs, DVDs, iPods, and
connected servers on your desktop.
If a check box contains a check mark, the associated item appears on your
desktop. If the check box is empty, click it once to make a check mark appear.
If a check box already contains a check mark, you can click it once to make
the check mark disappear.
Here’s a quick rundown of the items that show up in the General pane:
 New Finder Window Opens: This menu lets you choose what folder
appears (when you create a new window in the Finder using File➪
New Window or the shortcut Ô+N.)
Other: If you don’t like the choices the menu offers — Home, Documents,
or your computer, hard disk, or iDisk — choose this bottom item in the
menu instead. It’ll let you choose any folder you like for new Finder 
windows.
Figure 4-12:
The four

113
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

 Always Open Folders in a New Window: This check box does exactly
what its name implies, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 
 Open New Windows in Column View: This check box also does exactly
what its name implies — it causes your new windows to open in Column
view, instead of whichever view you last used with that folder or disk.
 Spring-Loaded Folders and Windows: This check box turns spring-
loaded folders on and off, whereas the Delay slider below it governs how
long a spring-loaded folder takes to spring open.
Spring-loaded folders are very useful; I recommend turning them on and
using them as often as possible. To see how they work, turn them on
now and drag any icon onto a folder or disk icon BUT DO NOT RELEASE
THE MOUSE BUTTON. The folder icon inverts to let you know you’re in
the right place, and shortly thereafter (how shortly depends upon your
Delay slider setting), the folder pops open right under your cursor.
To accelerate the process of popping open a folder — regardless of your
Delay slider setting — press the spacebar after the folder (or disk) icon
inverts.
Using the Labels pane
Did you know that you can label files? You can. Select a file or folder (or sev-
eral files and folders), pull down the File menu, and move the cursor over the
color dot that represents the label you want to assign to the file or folder.
Release the mouse button and the file takes on the hue of its label.
The Labels tab in Finder Preferences lets you change the names of those labels.
Just select the existing name (Red, Orange, and so on) and type a new one.
Using the Sidebar pane
The Sidebar pane (also called the Sidebar tab) offers check boxes to hide or
show items in the Sidebar. In Figure 4-12, I’ve got everything it offers checked,
so all the items you see — Computer, Hard disks, iDisk, Network, Connected
servers, CDs, Desktop, Home, and Applications — appear in the Sidebar of
my Finder windows.
There’s an even easier way to add icons to the Sidebar — drag them onto the
lower part of it and then release the mouse button. The icon isn’t moved from
its actual location, but you can now access its contents by clicking it in the
Sidebar rather than opening a bunch of folders to get to it.
114
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Using the Advanced pane
The Advanced tab offers a check box to Show All File Extensions. When it’s
checked, all your document files will display a three- or four-letter extension
such as .doc, .jpeg, .mp3, and so on. Uncheck the check box and the exten-
sions are hidden.
The second check box, Show Warning before Emptying the Trash, lets you
turn off the annoying trash warning — the one that asks if you’re SURE you
want to empty the Trash — whenever you empty the Trash.
Last but not least, if you click the Select button below Languages for
Searching File Contents, a window appears, showing check boxes for lan-
guages you might want to use when you search the contents of your files.
Any language with a check mark gets indexed and searched; those without
check marks are not.
The fewer languages you choose, the faster the indexing occurs — and the
less disk space those indexes consume. Unless you need them, I suggest you
uncheck all but one or two.
The choices you make here affect the File➪Find (Ô+F) search mechanism, as
well as the Spotlight search mechanism in the upper-right corner of the menu
bar. (You can find more info on Spotlight in Chapter 11.) Another nifty factoid:
If you deselect all the languages here, you effectively turn off indexing.
Customizing the Finder 
with Folder Actions
Apple has this really cool technology called AppleScript. It’s been around
since System 7 was released and hasn’t ever really gotten the respect it
deserves. AppleScript lets you program repetitive tasks so you don’t have to
go through all the steps yourself every time you want to perform the task.
Almost a decade later (Mac OS 8.5), Apple introduced Folder Actions, a way
to attach these AppleScripts to a folder so an appropriate script would run
whenever the folder was opened, closed, moved, had an item placed in it, or
had an item removed.
Having an AppleScript run when items are added to a closed folder sounds
like a great tool for drop-box-style folders to me — how about you? For exam-
ple, you could have Mail launch and send a notification to your project leader
or project team whenever a new file was added to the folder.
115
Chapter 4: Newfangled Finder

The first thing to do is create or obtain AppleScripts to perform the tasks you
want done. Programming AppleScript is beyond the purview of this book —
in fact, a book teaching you all about programming AppleScript is the size of
this book alone — it’s AppleScript For Dummies, Second Edition, by Tom
Trinko (Wiley). Closer to hand, you can find ready-to-go scripts for Folder
Actions on your hard drive at
Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts
and even more at Apple’s Web site in the AppleScript pages (www.apple.
com/applescript).
After you’ve enabled Folder Actions, you can Control+click the folder’s icon
again and choose a new item from the contextual menu, Attach a Folder
Action. This opens a Choose a File dialog (really an Open dialog, which I tell
you about in Chapter 5) where you can select your Folder Action script. The
dialog conveniently defaults to the Folder Action Scripts folder mentioned
previously. Select the script, click Choose, and you’re set to go.
If you want to know more about writing Folder Action scripts, check out www.
apple.com/applescript/folder_actions.

In This Chapter
 Saving your document
 Discovering the differences between Save and Save As
 Mastering the Open dialog
 Discerning the subtle differences between the Open dialog and Save sheets
 Knowing what the Open dialog doesn’t show you
T
his could be the most important chapter in this book. If you don’t under-
stand how to open and save files using the Open dialog and Save sheets,
you’ll have a heck of a time getting the hang of your Mac. Ask any long-time
Mac user — the old lament is pretty common: “Well, I saved the file and now 
I don’t know where it went.” It happens all the time with new users; if they
don’t master these essential techniques, they often become confused about
where files are located on their hard drive.
This chapter is the cure-all for your Save, Save As, and Open woes. Hang with
me and pay attention; everything will soon become crystal-clear. And keep
saying to yourself, “The Save sheets and the Open dialog are just another way
of looking at the Finder,” as I explain in this chapter.
You work with Open dialogs and Save sheets within applications. You only
see them after you launch your favorite application and open or save a file.
(For more on launching applications, read through Chapter 2 on icons; for
more on creating and opening documents, see the documentation for the pro-
gram that you’re using.)

Saving Your Document 
Before It’s Too Late
You can create as many documents as you want, using one program or dozens
of ’em, but all is lost if you don’t save the files to a storage device like your
hard drive or other disk. When you save a file, you’re committing a copy to a
disk — whether a disk mounted on your Desktop, one available over a net-
work, or on a removable medium such as a Zip or floppy disk, CD-R, CD-RW,
DVD-R, or DVD-RW.
In this section, I show you how to save your masterpieces. Prevent unneces-
sary pain in your life by developing good saving habits. I recommend you
save your work
 Every few minutes
 Before you switch to another program
 Before you print a document
 Before you stand up
118
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 
Hiding your stuff under the right rock
If you’ve used previous versions of Mac OS, 
the rules about where to store things were a lot
looser. Storing everything within your Docu-
ments folder wasn’t at all important. But Mac
OS X arranges its system files, applications, and
other stuff a bit differently from the way the
older versions did.
I strongly advise you to store all your document
files and the folders that contain them in the
Documents folder within your Home folder or
your Home folder’s Movies folder, Music folder,
or Pictures folder if that’s where the application
(such as iMovie) recommends. Files that you
place outside the Documents folder are very
likely to get lost while you navigate through a
maze of aliases and folders that belong to (and
make sense to) particular programs or parts of
the system software — and not to you as a user.
An exception to this rule is to place files you
need to share with other users in the Shared
folder, inside the Users folder in which your
Home folder resides.
If other people besides you use your Mac (and
they changed privilege settings to give you
access to their directories — see Chapter 14),
you could even save a file in another user’s
folder by accident, in which case you’d proba-
bly never find it again.
So, trust me when I say that the Documents
folder in your Home folder is the right place to
start, not only because it’s easy to remember,
but also because it’s only a menu command
(Go➪Home) or keyboard shortcut (Ô+Shift+H)
away, wherever you’re working on your Mac.

If you don’t heed this advice and the program that you’re using crashes while
switching programs, printing, or sitting idle (which, not coincidentally, are
the three most likely times for a crash), you lose everything that you did
since your last save. The fact that a program crash doesn’t bring down the
entire system (as it did under Mac OS 9) is small consolation when you’ve
lost everything you’ve typed since the last time you saved . . .
The keyboard shortcut for Save in almost every program I know is Ô+S.
Memorize it. See it in your dreams. Train your finger muscles to do it uncon-
sciously. Use it (the keyboard shortcut) or lose it (your unsaved work).
Checking out the Save sheet
When you choose to save a file for the first time (by choosing File➪Save or
pressing Ô+S), a Save sheet appears in front of the window that you’re saving,
as shown in Figure 5-1 — we’ll call this a Basic sheet. You can choose any
folder or volume listed in a Finder window’s Sidebar by clicking a Basic sheet’s
Where pop-up menu and taking your pick — or you can expand the sheet (as
shown in Figure 5-2), and navigate folders just as you would in the Finder: by
opening them to see their contents.
Before you can navigate the columns in a Save sheet, you need to click the
downward-pointing disclosure triangle to expand the sheet. It’s to the right 
of the Save As text field in Figure 5-1 and my pointer is hovering over it, 
about to click.
So, the disclosure triangle toggles between the basic and expanded Save
sheets. If yours is small (as shown in Figure 5-1) and you want it expanded,
click the disclosure triangle; the result of doing so is shown in Figure 5-2.
The Save sheet offers both Column or List views. In Column view, you click an
item on the left to see its contents on the right, just as you do in a Finder
window. List view offers no disclosure triangles (as you see in Finder win-
dows), so you double-click folders to open them and see their contents.
In an Expanded sheet, the pop-up menu shows a path from the currently
selected folder; it’s similar to the menu you see when you Command+click 
a Finder window’s title but with Recent Places grafted onto its bottom. 
You can also use the Forward and Back buttons or the Sidebar, both only
available in an expanded Save dialog, to conveniently navigate your disk.
Choose between Column and List view in Save sheets by clicking the List or
Column view buttons which look like their counterparts in Finder windows
(they’re between the pop-up menu and the Forward and Back buttons in
Figure 5-2).
119
Chapter 5: Mastering the Save Sheet and the Open Dialog

Like the List or Column view in a Finder window, you can enlarge the Save
sheet to see more. Just drag the lower-right corner of the sheet down or to
the right. Then, when you click items in the current right column of the Save
sheet (note that you must have the columns showing before you can have
any columns to deal with here), their contents appear in a new, third column.
After you’ve saved a file for the first time, choosing File➪Save or pressing
Ô+S doesn’t bring up a Save sheet anymore. It just saves the file again with-
out any further intervention on your part. Get in the habit of pressing Ô+S
often. It can’t hurt and just may save your bacon someday.

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

In Figures 5-1 and 5-2, you see, respectively, the Save sheet for the TextEdit
program, default and expanded. In programs other than TextEdit or when you
open a Plain Text document in TextEdit, the Save sheet may contain addi-
tional options, fewer options, or different options, and therefore may look
slightly different. Don’t worry. The Save sheet always works the same, no
matter what options there are.
In Mac OS X, you can move the window and attached Save sheet (just as you
can any window) by dragging the window’s title bar. Just click the title bar
and then hold down the mouse button while you drag the window wherever
you desire. The Save sheet moves right along with the window. (Unlike the
Save dialog in earlier versions of Mac OS, a Save sheet isn’t “modal,” which
means it doesn’t prevent you from using other programs or windows when
it’s on-screen.)
Wherefore art thou, Where pop-up menu?
Take some time and get to know the Where pop-up menu. It’s a great naviga-
tion aid, but a bit confusing for new users. With it, you can quickly move to a
location on your hard drive and open or save a file stored there. Consider the
Where pop-up menu a shortcut menu to all the items in a Finder window’s
Sidebar.
The Where pop-up menu in the Basic view looks a lot like the pop-up menu
that appeared at the top of the Open/Save dialogs in earlier versions of Mac
OS. But instead of tracing the folder path (as it did in versions of yore, and as
it still does in the Expanded view), the Where pop-up menu lists one or more
places where you may save your files (Documents, Home) as well as other
folders where you have opened or saved files recently. Note the correlation
between the items in the Where menu on the unexpanded Save sheet on the
right and the items in the Sidebar of the expanded Save sheet on the left in
Figure 5-3.
Figure 5-3:

121
Chapter 5: Mastering the Save Sheet and the Open Dialog

After you’ve chosen a folder from the Where menu, you can still navigate to
other folders by using the Sidebar or the List or Column browser if you’re
using the Expanded view.
With all of these ways to navigate to your target folder — the mouse, the
Where menu, the Sidebar, the browsers, and the arrow keys — you should
always be able to get to your target folder (for saving the document) with just
a few clicks or keystrokes.
In this section, I run down the parts of the Where pop-up menu. In the process, I
show you why it’s best to store your files in certain places on your Mac. Finally, I
show you how to use the Where menu to quickly reach your favorite folders.
The Where menu is contextual — it displays different folders based on which
view you’re in, whether Basic or Expanded. If you haven’t expanded the Save
sheet, the Where pop-up menu displays your currently active directory at the
top (Documents in Figure 5-3), followed by your available computers and vol-
umes (iDisk, Network, and TigerDisk in Figure 5-3), followed by folders in your
Sidebar in Finder windows (Desktop, bobl, Applications, Documents, Movies,
Music, and Pictures in Figure 5-3), followed by folders or disks you’ve used
recently (none are showing in Figure 5-3). 
When you expand the Save sheet, the pop-up is no longer labeled “Where.”
And it now displays the hierarchy from the current folder to the Computer
level, just like Ô+clicking a window’s name in the Finder.
Saving to the active folder
In an expanded Save sheet, the name at the top in the Where pop-up menu is
the name of the active item (be it a folder, a drive, or the Desktop). In Figure
5-4, the active folder is Folder 2.
A file saved into Folder 2 appears in the column where you see Folder 3 in
Figure 5-4.
Think of the active item in a Save sheet as akin to the active window on the
Desktop. That’s where your file is saved by default if you click the Save but-
ton without changing the destination folder at all. This concept is important.
In other words, if the Documents folder is the active item (as it is in both
Figures 5-1 and 5-2), your document is saved in the Documents folder when
you click the Save button. If Folder 2 is the active item (as it is in Figure 5-4),
your document is saved in Folder 2 when you click the Save button. 
In Figure 5-4, if I clicked Folder 3 before I clicked the Save button, the menu
would have changed to say Folder 3, and the file would be saved in Folder 3
instead of Folder 2.
And so on.
122
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

The best places to save
Here’s a quick rundown of the folders that appear by default in your Sidebar
and Where menu (in unexpanded Save sheets):
 Documents: Located within your Home folder, the Documents folder is
the best place to store your files (in my humble opinion). You can orga-
nize stuff inside your Documents folder by creating subfolders with
meaningful names. For example, in my Documents folder, you’d find sub-
folders named Fonts that start with the letter V, Agrapha Icon Sets,
NonCom, and so on.
 Desktop: A good place to save files you’re going to be using in the 
short term.
The Desktop is not a great place for long-term storage of files and fold-
ers. If the Desktop becomes overcrowded, you’ll have trouble finding
files (and a big pile of icons isn’t a pretty sight on-screen).
 Home: All users have their own Home folder that contains all their stuff —
their documents, their preferences, their applications — everything that
belongs to them. You can save documents to your Home folder, which is
named for you (the example is called bobl in all of this chapter’s figures).
To save files here, choose Home from the Where menu, or click the
Home folder (bobl) in the Sidebar, and then click the Save button.
Figure 5-4:

into Folder 2.

Chapter 5: Mastering the Save Sheet and the Open Dialog

I don’t, however, recommend saving most of your stuff to your Home
folder. It quickly gets overcrowded and unmanageable. I find it easier to
organize and find files in the Documents folder, away from the Library,
Pictures, Music, and other folders that live in Home already.
 Applications: This is where OS X likes to find your application programs. 
Do not save documents here! The only reason that it appears in the
Sidebar and the Where pop-up menu is that you use it frequently to find
an application to launch.
 Movies, Music, and Pictures: The Movies, Music, and Pictures folders
appear in the Sidebar by default and are good locations for saving
iMovies, songs, and photos or scans, respectively.
If you can’t find the folder you want to save your document into, type 
its name into the search box, click the Computer, Home, or current
folder button, and the Save sheet will show you items that match what
you typed.
Here’s a handy shortcut for naming files in the Save sheet. Click a grayed-out
file name in the file list and it becomes the name of the file you’re saving, as
shown in Figure 5-5.
Be careful using this shortcut — unless you change the name that appears in
the Save As field before you click the Save button, you could overwrite the
existing file with the file you’re about to save — which may or may not be what
you want to do. Luckily, Mac OS X looks out for you and you’ll see a warning
like the one shown in Figure 5-6 if you’re about to overwrite a file. So give it
some thought before you blithely click the Replace button or press the Enter
or Return key.

124
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Even with the proviso just stated, this can be a handy shortcut as long as you
remember to alter the name of the file you’re saving (so as not to accidentally
overwrite an existing file).
So, in Figure 5-6, I’d select the date in the Save As field (09.28.04), delete it,
and type today’s date, which would not only avoid overwriting any files in
this folder, it would also make the file’s name more descriptive.
Getting active with the Save As field
When a Save sheet appears for the first time, the Save As field is active and
displays the name of the document. The document name (often Untitled) is
selected; when you begin typing, the name disappears and is replaced by the
name you type.
If you press the Tab key while the Save As field is active, it becomes inactive,
and the Search box becomes active. Press Tab again and the Sidebar be-
comes active. Press the Tab key one more time and the file list box (more
accurately known as the detail pane — the part with the list view or columns
in it) becomes active. That’s because the file list box, the Search box, the
Sidebar, and the Save As field are all mutually exclusive. Only one can be
active at any time.
Look at Figure 5-7. In the top-left picture, the Save As field is active; in the top-
right picture, the Search box is active; in the bottom-left picture, the Sidebar
is active; and in the bottom-right picture, the file list box is active.

Chapter 5: Mastering the Save Sheet and the Open Dialog

You can always tell which item is active by the thin blue or gray border
around it.
When you want to switch to a different folder to save a file, click the folder in
the Sidebar (if you’re using Column view) or click anywhere in the file list box
(Column or List view) to make the file list active. 
The Save As field, the Search box, the Sidebar, or the file list box is active at
any given time; no two can ever be active at the same time.

126
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

The following lists are some things to help you get a hold on this whole active/
inactive silliness:
 Look for the thin border that shows you which part of the Save sheet is
active as indicated in Figure 5-7.
 If you type while the file list box is active, the list scrolls and selects the
folder that most closely matches the letter(s) that you type. It’s a little
strange because you won’t see what you type: You’ll be typing blind, so
to speak. Go ahead and give it a try. For example, typing the letters mu
in the file list box of Figure 5-7 selects the Music folder.
 If you type while the Sidebar is active, nothing happens. You can, how-
ever, use the up- and down-arrow keys to move around in the Sidebar.
 When the file list is active, the letters that you type don’t appear in the
Save As field. If you want to type a file name, you have to activate the
Save As field again (by clicking in it or using the Tab key) before you can
type in it.
 Regardless of which box or field is active at the time, when you press the
Tab key on your keyboard, the next in sequence becomes active. So if the
Save As field is active, it becomes inactive when you press Tab, and the
Search box becomes active. Tab again and the Sidebar becomes active.
Tab again, and the file list box becomes active. Press Tab again, and the
Save As field becomes active again.
 Pressing Shift reverses the order. Press Shift-Tab and the active item
moves from the Save As field to the file list box to the Sidebar to the
Search box and back to the Save As field again.
If you don’t feel like pressing the Tab key, you can achieve the same
effect by clicking the file list box, the Sidebar, or the Save As field to
make it active. Try it yourself and notice again how visual cues let you
know which is active. When the file list is active, it displays a border;
when the Save As field or the Sidebar is active, the file list has no border,
and the active field displays a border — which means you can edit it or
navigate it.
Putting your finger on the button
Most Save sheets contain the following three buttons (New Folder, Cancel,
Save), and many offer a Hide Extension check box (refer to Figure 5-2). I
describe them all briefly in the following list:
 New Folder: The New Folder button is a nice touch, but is present only
in an expanded Save sheet. Click this button, and you create a new
folder inside the active folder. You first get the opportunity to name the
folder; then you can save your document there.
The keyboard shortcut for New Folder is Ô+ N. 
127
Chapter 5: Mastering the Save Sheet and the Open Dialog

I’ve never seen this shortcut documented in Mac Help (or anywhere
else, for that matter). So it may well be a Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies
exclusive.
 Cancel: Clicking this button dismisses the Save sheet without saving
anything anywhere. In other words, the Cancel button returns things to
the way they were before you displayed the Save sheet.
The keyboard shortcut for Cancel is Ô+. (Ô+ a period). Pressing the Esc
key usually (but not always) does the same thing. This shortcut is a
good command to memorize because it cancels almost all dialogs, and it
also cancels lots of other things. If a program is dragging — your spread-
sheet is calculating or your database is sorting or your graphics pro-
gram is rotating, for example, and it’s taking too long — try pressing
either Esc or Ô+. (period). (They work — usually.)
 Save: Click this button to save the file to the active folder.
But wait! What if the Save button is grayed out? This happens when the
Save As field is blank; typing even one character will activate the Save
button again.
Make sure that the folder you want to save your document in is showing
in the (Where) pop-up menu. If you’re not sure and you click the Save
button, you could be the next one to say, “Well, I saved the file and now I
don’t know where it went.”
 Hide extension: Marking this check box turns off the display of file name
extensions, such as .rtf, .pdf, or .txt, in Save sheets.
Looks like Save, acts like Save — 
why’s it called Save As?
The Save As command — which you can find in the File menu of almost every
program ever made (at least those that create documents) — lets you resave
a file that has already been saved by giving it a different name.
Why would you want to do that? Here’s a good (albeit kind of rude) example:
Suppose you have two cousins, Kate and Zelda. You write Kate a long, chatty
letter and save this document with the name Letter to Kate. At some point
afterward, you decide you want to send this same letter to Zelda, too, but
you want to change a few things. So you change the part about your date last
night (Zelda isn’t as liberated as Kate) and replace all references to Kevin
(Kate’s husband) with Zeke (Zelda’s husband). (Aren’t computers grand?)
So you make all these changes to Letter to Kate, but you haven’t saved
this document yet. And although the document on your screen is actually a
128
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

letter to Zelda, its file name is still Letter to Kate. Think of what would
happen if you were to save it now without using the Save As feature: Letter
to Kate reflects the changes that you just made (the stuff in the letter meant
for Kate is blown away, replaced by the stuff that you write to Zelda). Thus,
the file name Letter to Kate is inaccurate. Even worse, you would no
longer have a copy of the letter you sent to Kate!
The solution? Just use Save As to rename this file Letter to Zelda by choos-
ing File➪Save As. A Save sheet appears, in which you can type a different file
name in the Save As field. You can also navigate to another folder, if you like,
and save the newly named version of the file there.
Now you have two distinct files: Letter to Kate and Letter to Zelda.
Both contain the stuff they should but both started life from the same file.
That’s what Save As is for.
An even better idea is to choose Save As just before you begin modifying the
document and give it the new name. That way, when you’re done with your
changes, you don’t have to remember to choose Save As — you can just per-
form your habitual Save. It also protects you from accidentally saving part of
the Letter to Zelda without changing its name first (which you’re likely to do
if you’re following my advice to save often). So when you decide you’re going
to reuse a document, Save As before you begin working on it, just to be safe.
Open Sez Me
If you’ve read the earlier parts of this chapter, you probably already know
how to use the Open dialog — you just don’t yet know that you know. Open
dialogs are so much like Save sheets that it’s scary. To summon an Open
dialog, launch your favorite program and choose File➪Open (or use the key-
board shortcut Ô+O, which works in 98 percent of all programs ever made).
Check out a typical Open dialog in Figure 5-8.
If I were to click the Open button in Figure 5-8, the file Dr. Mac 11.15.04.doc
would open in TextEdit, the program I’m using.
If you can’t find the folder in which you want to save your document, type the
folder’s name into the Search box, and then click (a) the Computer button to
search everywhere, (b) the Home button to search only in your Home folder,
or (c) the current folder button to search the active folder. You don’t even
have to press Enter or Return; the Save sheet updates itself to show you only
items that match the characters as you’ve typed them.
129
Chapter 5: Mastering the Save Sheet and the Open Dialog

Knowing the differences between 
Open dialogs and Save sheets
After you master navigating the Save sheet, you should have smooth sailing
when you use an Open dialog. They work the same except for a few minor 
differences:
 No Save As field: A Save As field isn’t needed in an Open dialog. Why
would it be? You’re looking for items to open, not naming items you’re
saving. Ergo, since you’re not saving or naming a file here, you don’t
need the Save As field.
 No Where pop-up menu: In the Open dialog, you find the path pop-up
menu instead. Why? Because you’re opening a file From a certain folder,
rather than telling your Mac Where to save it. The path menu has the
same basic job as the path menu in an expanded Save sheet, and you see
the same folders in it.
 No Expand button: You always have to be able to select a file, so the file
list pane (and the Sidebar) are omnipresent. I mean, if the Open dialog
weren’t expanded, where would you select the file to open?
 No New Folder button: Why? Well, you can’t open something that you
haven’t yet created, right? You don’t need to create new folders when
you’re opening a file, basically.
Figure 5-8:
The Open
dialog in all
its glory.
130
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

You may notice a couple of other differences between the Save sheet and the
Open dialog. At the bottom of the Open dialog (refer to Figure 5-8), note the
Plain Text Encoding popup menu and the Ignore Rich Text Commands check
box. These are specific to TextEdit and have to do with the format that TextEdit
uses to save text files. Don’t worry about these for now. Just remember that
many applications add special items to their Open dialogs and Save sheets
that help you to select formats and other options specific to those programs.
Navigate through the Open dialog just as you would a Save sheet. Don’t forget
the mantra, “The Open dialog and the Save sheet are just another way of
looking at the Finder.”
Knowing what the Open dialog 
doesn’t show you . . .
When you use a program’s Open dialog, only files that the program knows
how to open appear enabled (in a bold font) in the file list. In other words,
the program filters out the files it can’t open, so you barely see them in the
Open dialog. This method of selectively displaying certain items in Open
dialogs is a feature of most applications. Therefore, when you’re using
TextEdit, its Open dialog dims all your spreadsheet files (that’s because
TextEdit can only open text, Rich Text, Microsoft Word, and some picture
files). Pretty neat, eh?
Some programs — such as AppleWorks, Microsoft Word, and Adobe
Photoshop — have a Show or Format menu in their Open dialogs. This 
menu lets you specify the type(s) of files you want to see in the Open dialog.
You can usually open a file that appears dimmed by choosing All Documents
in the Show or Format menu (in those applications with Open dialogs that
offer such a menu).

n other parts of this book, you can discover the basics about windows and
icons and menus. Here, you begin a never-ending quest to discover the
fastest, easiest, and most trouble-free way to manage the files on your Mac.
And, along the way, you’ll discover what some of the special folders (most
notably the multiple Library folders) in Mac OS X are all about.
I’ve been wrangling with Macintosh files and folders for more than 20 years
now, and I’ve learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t — for me.
And although Mac OS X is very different from earlier versions of Mac OS, the
fundamentals of organizing files and folders haven’t changed that much. So
this chapter spares you at least part of my 15-year learning curve.
One thing I stress throughout this chapter is that what works for one user
may not work for another. So I encourage you to develop your own personal
style. I don’t preach (much) about the “right” way to organize your files. After
you’ve read this chapter, you’ll have all the ammunition that you need to
organize your files into a Mac environment designed by you, for you.
I won’t pretend to be able to organize your Mac for you. Organizing your files
is as personal as your taste in music; you develop your own style with the

Mac. This section simply gives you some food for thought — some ideas
about how I do it, and some suggestions that should make organization easier
for you, regardless of how you choose to do it yourself.
Working with Files and Folders
Before I go any farther, a closer look at files and folders is in order — the 
difference between a file and a folder, how you can arrange and move files
and folders around, and how to nest folders. Then you can concentrate on
becoming a savvier — and better organized — Mac OS X user.
Then, after I discuss your files and folders, I offer more about the folders that
Mac OS X creates (and requires). By the end of this chapter, you’ll not only
know all about your files and folders, you’ll also know about the files and fold-
ers that Mac OS X creates when you install it — and what they do.
Files versus folders
When I speak of a file, I’m talking about what’s connected to any icon except
a folder or disk icon. A file can be a document, an application, an alias of a file
or application, a dictionary, a font, or any other icon that isn’t a folder or disk.
The main distinction is that you can’t put something into most file icons.
The exceptions are icons that represent Mac OS X packages. A package is an
icon that acts like a file but isn’t. Examples of icons that are really packages
include most installers and applications as well as “documents” saved by
some programs (such as Keynote). When you open an icon that represents a
package the usual way (double-click, File➪Open, Ô+O, and so on), the pro-
gram or document opens. To see the contents of an icon that represents a
package, you have to Control+click it and look for the Show Package Contents
item in the menu. If it’s there, that icon is a package and you can see the files
and folders it contains by choosing Show Package Contents; if you don’t see a
Show Package Contents item in the contextual menu, the icon represents a
file, not a package. 
When I talk about folders, I’m talking about things that work like manila folders.
Their icons look like folders; they can contain files or other folders (subfolders).
You can put any icon — any file or folder — into a folder.
Here’s an exception: If you put a disk icon into a folder, you get an alias to the
disk (as I explain in Chapter 2) unless you hold down the Option key. Remember
that you can’t put a disk icon into a folder on itself. In other words, you can only
copy a disk icon to a different disk. Put another way, you can never copy a disk
icon into a folder that resides on that disk.
134
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Finally, disks are (in Desktop terms, anyway) nothing more than big folders. A
disk icon is, for all intents and purposes, the same as a folder icon. (Look in
the margin to see a typical folder icon.)
File icons can look like practically anything. If the icon doesn’t look like a
folder or one of the numerous disk icons, you can be pretty sure it’s a file.
Creating new folders
So you think Apple has already given you enough folders? Can’t imagine why
you’d need more? Think of creating new folders the same way you’d think of
labeling a new folder at work for a specific project. New folders help you keep
your files organized, enabling you to reorganize them just the way you want.
Creating folders is really quite simple.
To create a new folder, just follow these steps:
1. Decide which window you want the new folder to appear in, and then
make sure that window is active.
If you want to create a new folder right on the Desktop, make sure no
windows are active. 
You can make a window active by clicking it, and you can make the
Desktop active if you have windows on-screen by clicking the Desktop
itself.
2. Choose File➪New Folder (or press Ô+Shift+N).
A new, untitled folder appears in the active window with its name box
already highlighted, ready for you to type a new name for it.
3. Type a name for your folder.
If you accidentally click anywhere before you type a name for the folder,
the name box will no longer be highlighted. To highlight it again, select
the icon (single-click it) and then press Return (or Enter) once. Now you
can type its new name.
Name your folders with relevant names. Folders with nebulous titles like
sfdghb or Stuff — or, worst of all, Untitled — won’t make it any easier to
find something six months from now.
For maximum compatibility with other users and other operating sys-
tems, avoid using punctuation marks in file and folder names. Periods,
slashes, backslashes, and colons, in particular, can be reserved for use
by other operating systems. Although Tiger will let you use almost any
character except a period (as the first character) or a colon (anywhere
in the name), it’s a good idea to avoid using any punctuation marks in
your folder or file names.
135
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

While we’re on the subject, it’s not a good idea to use characters you
have to hold down the Option key to type in file or folder names. I’m
talking about ones like: (tm) (Option+2), (r) (Option+r) ¢ (Option+4) or
even (c) (Option+g). So get in the habit of not using those in file names,
either.
For files you might share with users of non-Macintosh computers, here’s
the rule for maximum compatibility: No punctuation and no Option-key
characters in the file name.
Navigating Nested Folders
Folders within other folders are often called nested folders. To get a feel for
the way nested folders work in Mac OS X, check out Figure 6-1. You can see
the following from the figure:
 Folder 1 is one level deep.
 Folder 2 is inside Folder 1, which is one level deeper than Folder 1, 
or two levels deep.
 Folder 3 is inside Folder 2 and is three levels deep.
 The files inside Folder 3 are four levels deep.
Folder 1
1 Level deep
2 Levels deep
Folder 2
3 Levels deep
4 Levels deep
Folder 3
File 1 File 2
Figure 6-1:

136
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

If the previous list makes sense to you, you’re golden. What’s important here is
that you are able to visualize the path to Folder 3. That is, to get to files inside
Folder 3, you open Folder 1 and then open Folder 2 to be able to open Folder
3. Understanding this concept is important to understanding the relationships
between files and folders. Keep reviewing this section and eventually the con-
cept will click — you’ll slap yourself in the head and say, “Now I get it!”
Moving files and folders
You can move files and folders around within a window to your heart’s con-
tent as long as that window is set to the Icon view. Just click and drag any
icon to its new location in the window.
Some people spend hours arranging icons in a window so that they’re just so.
But because using Icon view wastes so much screen space, I avoid using
icons in a window.
You can’t move icons around in a window that’s viewed as a list or as
columns, which makes total sense when you think about it. (Well, you can
move them to put them in a different folder in List or Column view, but that’s
not moving them around, really.)
As you may expect from Apple, the King of Having Lots of Ways to Do Anything,
you have choices for how you move one file of folder into another folder. You
can use these techniques to move any icon — folder, document, alias, or pro-
gram icon — into folders or onto other disks.
 Drag an icon onto a folder icon: Drag the icon for one folder (or file)
onto the icon for another folder (or disk) and then release when the
second folder is highlighted (see Figure 6-2). The first folder is now
inside the second folder. Put another way, the first folder is now a sub-
folder of the second folder.
This technique works regardless of whether the second folder’s window
is open.
Figure 6-2:
Placing one
folder into
another.
137
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

 Drag an icon into an open folder’s window: Drag the icon for one folder
(or file) into the open window for a second folder (or disk), as shown in
Figure 6-3.
If you try to move an item from one disk to another disk, it’s only copied —
not moved. If you want to move a file or folder from one disk to another, you
have to trash the original manually after the copying is complete unless you
use the following tip. 
If you hold down the Ô key when you drag an icon from one disk to another,
it’s moved instead of copied, and the original is deleted automatically. The
little Copying Files window even changes to read Moving Files. Nice touch, eh?
Copying files or folders
What if you want to copy an icon from one place to another, leaving the icon
in its original location and creating an identical copy in the destination
window? No problem — all it takes is the addition of the Option key.
If you’re wondering why anyone would ever want to do that, trust me:
Someday you will. Suppose (for example) you have a file called Long Letter
to Mom in a folder called Old Correspondence. You figure that Mom has for-
gotten that letter by now, and you want to send it again. But before you do,
you want to change the date and delete the reference to Clarence, her pit
bull, who passed away last year. So now you need to put a copy of Long
Letter to Mom in your Current Correspondence folder. This technique
yields the same result as making a copy of a file by using Save As, which I
describe in Chapter 5.

138
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

When you copy a file, it’s wise to change the name of the copied file. Having
more than one file on your hard drive with the same exact name is not a good
idea, even if the files are in different folders. Trust me, having 10 files called
Expense Report or 15 files named Doctor Mac Direct Invoice can be
confusing, no matter how well organized your folder structure is. Add distin-
guishing words or dates to file and folder names so they’re named something
more explicit, such as Expense Report 10-03 or Doctor Mac Direct
Invoice 4-4-05.
You have four ways to copy a file or folder, as follows:
 Drag an icon from one folder icon onto another folder icon while
holding down the Option key.
Drag the icon for one folder onto the icon for another folder and then
release when the second folder is highlighted (refer to Figure 6-2). This
technique works regardless of whether the second folder’s window 
is open.
When you copy something by dragging and dropping it with the Option
key held down, the mouse pointer changes to include a little plus sign
(+) next to the arrow, as shown in the margin. Neat!
 Drag an icon into an open window for another folder while holding
down the Option key.
Drag the icon for the file or folder that you want to copy into the 
open window for a second folder (or removable media, such as a 
floppy disk) — refer to Figure 6-3.
 Copy an icon and paste it into another folder’s window.
Introduced to the Mac with the OS X 10.1 release, you can now click an
icon, choose Edit➪Copy (or press Ô+C), click where you want the icon
to go, and then choose Edit➪Paste (or press Ô+V) — it’s done.
 Choose File➪Duplicate or Control+click the file or folder that you want
to duplicate, and then select Duplicate from the contextual menu that
appears.
For more about the Duplicate command, check out Chapter 3.
You can have lots of files with the same name on the same disk (although, as I
mentioned earlier, it’s probably not a good idea). But your Mac won’t let you
have more than one file with the same name in the same folder.
Everything I’ve discussed so far in this chapter works at least as well for win-
dows that use the List or Column views as it does for windows using the Icon
view. In other words, I used the Icon view in the previous examples only
because it’s the best view for pictures to show you what’s going on. For what
it’s worth, I find moving and copying files easiest in windows that use the List
or Column views.
139
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

Opening files with drag-and-drop
Macintosh drag-and-drop is usually all about dragging text and graphics from
one place to another. But there’s another angle to drag-and-drop — one that
has to do with files and icons. I tell you the real deal in this section.
You can open a document by dragging its icon onto that of the proper appli-
cation. For example, you can open a document created with Microsoft Word
by dragging the document icon onto the Microsoft Word application’s icon.
The Word icon will highlight, and the document will launch. Of course, it’s
usually easier to just double-click a document’s icon to open it; the proper
application opens automatically when you do — or at least it does most of
the time. Which reminds me . . . 
If you try to open a file and Mac OS X can’t find a program to open the file,
Mac OS X prompts you with an alert window, as shown in Figure 6-4. You can
either click Cancel (and abort the attempt to open the file) or pick another
application to open.
Of course, you can click the Choose Application button and pick another pro-
gram from a regular Open File dialog (see Chapter 5 for details). If you click
the Choose Application button, a dialog appears (conveniently opened to
your Applications folder, and shown in Figure 6-5). Applications that Mac OS
X doesn’t think can be used to open the file are dimmed. For a wider choice
of applications, choose to view All Applications instead of Recommended
Applications from the Enable pop-up menu.
Here is a better way: Use drag-and-drop to open a file using a program other
than the one that would ordinarily launch when you open the document. To
do so, just drag the file onto the application’s icon (or alias icon or Dock
icon), and presto — the file opens in the application.
If the icon doesn’t highlight and you release the mouse button anyway, the
document will end up in the same folder as the application with the icon that
didn’t highlight. If that happens, just choose Edit➪Undo (or press Ô+Z), and
the mislaid document magically returns to where it was before you dropped
Figure 6-4:

OS X helps

140
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

it. Just remember — don’t do anything else after you drop the file, or Undo
may not work. If Undo doesn’t work, you must move the file back to its origi-
nal location by hand.
You can’t open every file with every program. For example, if you try to open
an MP3 (music) file with Microsoft Excel (a spreadsheet), it just won’t work —
you’ll get an error message or a screen full of gibberish. Sometimes you just
have to keep trying until you find the right program; other times, you won’t
have a program capable of opening the file.
Only applications that might be able to open the file will highlight when you
drag the document on them. That doesn’t mean the document will be usable,
just that the application can open it. Suffice to say that Mac OS X is smart
enough to figure out which applications on your hard drive can open what
documents — and to offer you a choice. 
You’re usually best off clicking the Choose Application button and sticking to
the Recommended Applications choice in the Choose Application dialog. But
if that doesn’t work for you, at least you now know another way — drag the
file onto an application’s icon and see what happens.
I don’t know if you noticed, but in Figure 6-5, Mac OS X is recommending I use
TextEdit to open a document I created in Microsoft Word. That’s right — the
free word processor that comes with Mac OS X can open Microsoft Word
files, and it can modify and save them again, too. Why does this make me
rave and marvel? Because now, even if you don’t own a copy of Microsoft
Word, you can open documents created by others using Microsoft Word, edit,
and resave them, all without having to buy your own copy of Microsoft Word.
Figure 6-5:

Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

Don’t get me wrong — I use Word more than any other program, and I have
no qualms. But for those of you who don’t need a full-featured, professional-
quality, relatively expensive writing environment, the freebie (TextEdit) may
very well be all the word processor you’ll ever need.
There is one last technique that works great when you want to open a docu-
ment with a program other than its default. For example, if I were to double-
click an MP3 file, the file will open in iTunes. But I frequently want to listen to
MP3 files using QuickTime Player (so they’re not added to my iTunes music
library). Dragging the MP3 file onto QuickTime Player’s Dock icon solves this
conundrum quickly and easily. 
Assigning an application to a 
document or document type
I don’t know about you, but people send me files all the time that were cre-
ated by applications I don’t use . . . or at least that I don’t use for that docu-
ment type. Mac OS X lets you specify the application in which you want to
open a document in the future when you double-click it. More than that, you
can specify that you want all documents of that type to open with the speci-
fied application. “Where is this magic bullet hidden?” you ask. Right there in
the file’s Show Info window.
Suppose, for example, that you want all graphic files that default to opening
in Preview JPEG to open with GraphicConverter (one of my favorite pieces of
OS X-savvy shareware) instead. Just click one of these files in the Finder and
then choose File➪Get Info (Ô+I). Then, in the Info window, click the gray tri-
angle to disclose the Open With pane, as shown in Figure 6-6.
Figure 6-6:
Select an
application
to open this
document.
142
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

A pop-up menu lets you choose from the applications that Mac OS X believes
will open this document type. In Figure 6-6, I’m choosing GraphicConverter.
Now, GraphicConverter will open when you double-click this particular 
document — but if you click the Change All button at the bottom of the
window (as I’ve done in Figure 6-7), you make GraphicConverter the default
application for all .jpg documents owned by Preview.
Organizing your stuff with subfolders
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can put folders inside other folders
to organize your icons. I call a folder that’s inside another folder a subfolder.
You can create subfolders according to whatever system makes sense to 
you — but why reinvent the wheel? Here are some organizational topic ideas
and naming examples for subfolders:
 By type of document: Word-Processing Documents, Spreadsheet
Documents, Graphics Documents
 By date: Documents May–June, Documents Spring ’03
 By content: Memos, Outgoing Letters, Expense Reports
 By project: Project X, Project Y, Project Z
When you notice your folders swelling and starting to get messy (that is, fill-
ing up with tons of files), subdivide them again by using a combination of
these methods that makes sense to you. For example, suppose you start by
Figure 6-7:
Make the
selected
application
the default
for this
document
type by
clicking the
Change All
button.
143
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

subdividing your Documents folder into multiple subfolders. Later, when
those folders begin to get full, you may subdivide them even further, as
shown in Figure 6-8.
My point (yes, I do have one!): Allow your folder structure to be organic,
growing as you need it to grow. Let it happen. Don’t let any one folder get so
full that it’s a hassle to deal with. Create new subfolders when things start to
get crowded.
If you want to monkey around with some subfolders yourself, a good place to
start is the Documents folder — it’s inside your Home folder (that is, it’s a
subfolder of your Home folder).
If you use a particular folder a great deal, make an alias of it and then move
the alias from the Documents folder to the Dock, your Home folder, your
Desktop(for more info on aliases, see Chapter 2) to make the folder easier to
access. Or drag the folder (or its alias) to the Sidebar where it’s always avail-
able, even in Open dialogs and Save sheets. For example, if you write a lot of
letters, you could keep an alias to your Correspondence folder in your Home
folder, in the Dock, or on your Desktop for quick access. (By the way, there’s
no reason you can’t have a folder appear in all three places if you like. That’s
what aliases are all about, aren’t they?)
If you put the Documents folder in the Dock, you can click and hold on it (or
Control+click) to reveal its subfolders, as shown in Figure 6-9.
Spring-loaded folders
Spring-loaded folders were resurrected in Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar, and
they work in all views and with all folder or disk icons in the Sidebar. Because

144
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

you just got the short course on folders and subfolders and various ways to
organize your stuff, you’re ready for your introduction to one of my favorite
ways to get around my disks, folders, and subfolders.
Here’s how they work: Select any icon except a disk icon and drag it onto any
folder or disk icon — but don’t release the mouse button. The folder or disk

145
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out
Creating subfolders . . . or not
How full is too full? When should you begin cre-
ating subfolders in a folder? That’s impossible to
say, but having too many items in a folder can
be a nightmare, as can having too many sub-
folders with just one or two files in them. My
guideline is this: If you find more than 15 or 20
files in a single folder, begin thinking about ways
to subdivide it.
On the other hand, some of my bigger subfold-
ers contain things that I don’t often access. For
example, my Bob’s Correspondence 1992 folder
contains more than 200 files. But because I
want to keep this folder on my hard drive in case
I do need to find something there — even
though I don’t use it very often — its over-
crowded condition doesn’t bother me. (Your
mileage may vary.)
Here are some tips to help you decide whether
to use subfolders or just leave well enough
alone:
 Don’t create subfolders until you need
them. In other words, don’t create a bunch
of empty folders because you think you may
need them someday. Wait to create new
folders until you need them; that way, you
avoid opening an empty folder when you’re
looking for something else — a complete
waste of time.
 Let your work style decide the file struc-
ture. When you first start working with your
Mac, you may want to save everything in
your Documents folder for a week or two (or
a month or two, depending on how many
new documents that you save each day).
When a decent-sized group of documents
has accumulated in the Documents folder,
consider taking a look at them and creating
logical subfolders for them.

icon will highlight to indicate that it’s selected. I call this hovering because
you’re doing just that — hovering the cursor over a folder or disk icon with-
out releasing the button.
In a second or two, the highlighted folder or disk will flash twice and then
spring open, right under the cursor. Then some more handy operations are
possible:
 You can continue to traverse your folder structure this way until you
release the mouse button. When you do, the icon you’ve been dragging
will be dropped into the active folder at the time. That window will
remain open — but all the windows you traversed will close.
 You can toggle spring-loaded folders on or off in the Finder’s Preference
window. There’s also a setting for how long the Finder waits before it
springs the folders open. If you’re impatient, you can spring a folder
open instantly by pressing the spacebar as you hover your mouse over
the folder.
 If you want to cancel a spring-loaded folder, drag the cursor away from
the folder icon or outside the boundaries of the sprung window — the
folder will pop shut.
After you get used to spring-loaded folders, you’ll wonder how you ever got
along without them. They work in all three window views, and they work with
icons in the Sidebar. Give ’em a try and you’ll be hooked.
Getting Up to Speed with the 
Mac OS X Folder Structure
In addition to your personal files and folders, your Mac OS X system has its
own folder structure. These folders contain the system software that runs the
Mac, as well as folders that include system preferences, fonts, and other files
used by everyone with access to this Mac. These shared files include applica-
tions, programs, utilities, and other software.
Also, each person who uses the Mac has his or her own set of folders —
these contain documents, preferences, and other information used by only
that person. If you’re the sole person who accesses your Mac, you have only
one user. Regardless, the folder structure that Mac OS X uses is the same,
whether you have one user or ten.
I realize that a lot of people don’t share their Macs with others. And if you’re
one of these folks, you may wonder why I keep mentioning sharing and multiple
users and the like. Well, Mac OS X is based on the UNIX operating system — a
multiuser operating system found on high-end servers and workstations that
146
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

are often shared by several people. Mac OS X has both the benefit of this
arrangement and a bit of the confusion caused when a single user (could it be
you?) fires up a computer that could be set up for several people. That’s why
Mac OS X folders are organized the way they are — with different hierarchies
for each user and for the computer as a whole.
All these files are stored in a nested folder structure that’s a bit tricky to
understand at first. This structure makes more sense after you spend a little
time with it and learn some basic concepts.
In this section, I walk you through these different folder structures one by
one, starting with the place where you’ll spend most of your time — your
Home folder.
The Mac OS X folder structure in depth
I start with the Computer folder, which is the top level of the folder hierarchy.
The Computer folder shows all the storage devices (hard drives, CD- or DVD-
ROM, Zip disk, and so forth) that are currently connected to your Mac. Figure
6-10 shows a hard disk and a Network icon, with which you can access servers
or shared Macs on your network. (Don’t quite know what file sharing is all
about? Read Chapter 14 for the whole scoop on sharing files with other Macs
and sharing your Mac with other users.
The computer name, Tiger TiBook in Figure 6-10, can be changed in the
Sharing System Preference pane.
To find the Computer folder, use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Shift+C or click its
icon in the Sidebar of any Finder window.
You may have more or fewer icons in your Computer folder than the two 
that you see in Figure 6-10 (depending upon how many disks that you have
Figure 6-10:
Contents 
of the
Computer
folder.
147
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

mounted), but I’m going to drill down on the one that holds your Mac OS X
stuff. In Figure 6-10, that hard drive is called TigerDisk — of course, I have no
idea what yours is called; if you haven’t changed it, it’s probably called
Macintosh HD. Double-click that icon to open it.
Inside your boot-disk icon (the one with OS X installed on it; the one called
TigerDisk in Figure 6-10) is everything on that disk. You should see at least
four folders (unless you’ve added some — if you installed the Developer
Tools CD, for example, or an OS 9 System Folder, you’ll have more). I’ll go
through each of them for you.
Applications
The Applications folder, located at the root level of your boot drive (the one
with OS X installed on it), is accessible with a click of the Application icon on
the Sidebar, from the Go menu, or by using the keyboard shortcut Ô+Shift+A.
In this folder, you find applications that Apple includes with Mac OS X. All
users of a given Mac have access to the items in this Applications folder.
Library
The Library folder at the root level of your Mac OS X hard drive is like a
public library — it stores items that everyone with access to this Mac can
use. You’ll find two different library folders on your hard drive — the one at
the root level of your OS X disk and another in your Home folder.
Okay, I wasn’t entirely truthful but only for your own good: There’s actually a
third Library folder inside the System folder, which I discuss in a page or two.
But for now, heed this warning: Leave this folder alone — don’t move, remove,
or rename it or do anything within it. It’s the nerve center of your Mac. In
other words, you should never have to touch this third Library folder.
Think of the Library folder inside your Home folder like a library in your own
house (have you ever actually been in a house with its own library?) and the
one at root level as a public library. I talk more about these Library folders in
the upcoming sections.
You find a bunch of folders inside the Library folder at root level (the public
Library folder). Most of them contain files that you never need to open,
move, or delete.
By and large, the Library subfolder that gets the most use is the Fonts folder,
which houses all the fonts installed on the Mac. Fonts can be available in one
of two ways:
 To everyone who uses the Mac: If that’s the case, they’re stored here in
the Fonts folder.
 To a single user: In this case, you look for the fonts in the user’s Library
folder (that familiar subfolder of the Home folder).
148
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

I discuss fonts more in Chapter 10. Meanwhile, some other subfolders that
you may use or add to are the iMovie and iTunes folders (where you put plug-
ins for those programs), the Scripts folder (which houses AppleScripts acces-
sible to all users), and Desktop Pictures (where you can place pictures to be
used as Desktop backgrounds).
Leave the “public” Library folder pretty much alone unless you’re using the
Fonts folder or know what you’re adding to one of the other folders. Don’t
remove, rename, or move any files or folders. Mac OS X uses these items and
is very picky about where they’re kept and how they’re named.
Note: Under most circumstances, you won’t actually add or remove items
from folders in this Library yourself. Software installers usually do the heavy
lifting for you by placing all their little pieces into appropriate Library fold-
ers. You shouldn’t need to touch this Library often, if ever. That said, know-
ing what these folders are — and who can access their contents — may come
in handy down the road a piece.
If you want to add something to a Library, it’s usually best to add it to your
Home/Library.
Mac OS 9
If you have Mac OS 9.2.2 installed on the same disk as OS X, this folder con-
tains your Mac OS 9.2.2 System folder (which the Classic environment
requires) as well as the System Disk program (which enables you to choose
to boot your Mac from Mac OS 9.2.2 or OS X).
You can read more about Classic in Chapter 12.
System
The System folder includes the files that Mac OS X needs to start up and keep
working. Leave this folder alone — don’t move, remove, or rename it or any-
thing within it. It’s a part of the nerve center of your Mac.
If you’ve used any previous version of Mac OS, you should notice two things:
 The System folder doesn’t include the same items or the same arrange-
ment of files and folders.
 This folder is now simply called System rather than System Folder.
Also gone are the System file and Finder file that have been around since
the first Mac. Located here instead is the slew of files that make up the
Mac OS X system.
149
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

Users
When you open the Users folder, you see a folder for each person who uses
the Mac as well as the Shared folder.
The Shared folder that you see in the Users folder allows everyone who uses
the Mac to use the files stored there. If you want other people who use your
Mac to have access to a file or folder, this is the place to stash it.
In the next section, I drill down from the Home folder bobl to see what’s
inside. When the user bobl logs onto this Mac, his Home folder (bobl)
appears whenever he either clicks the bobl Home icon in the Sidebar,
chooses Go➪Home, or uses the keyboard shortcut Ô+Shift+H.
Enough with the big-picture folder structure! Read on as I dig into how to
work with the folders and files in Mac OS X.
There’s no place like Home
Your Home folder is the most important folder to you as a user — or at least
the one where you’ll probably spend most of your time — but it’s only part of
Mac’s higher-level folder structure. I walk you through this configuration so
that you understand where your Home folder fits in and so that you’ll be able
to find applications and other items shared by everyone who uses your Mac.
It’s kind of complicated, especially if you’re an old-time Mac user who’s used
to arranging things pretty much the way you want. Take heart, though: After
you get the hang of the new way of arranging things, it makes sense.
I strongly recommend that you store all files you create or work with in a sub-
folder within your Home folder. The advantage of using the Documents folder
to hold your documents is that it’s easy to find, and many programs use it as
the default folder when you open or save a file.
When you open your Home folder, you see a Finder window with your user-
name in the title bar. Seeing your username in the Finder window’s title bar
tells you that you’re in your Home folder. Every user has a Home folder
named after his or her short username (as specified in the Accounts System
Preference pane). In Figure 6-11, you can see that my Home folder is named
bobl — the short name I used when I first set up my Mac.
Your Home folder has several folders inside it created by Mac OS X. You can
create more if you like — in fact, every folder that you ever create (at least
every one you create on this particular disk or volume) should be within
your Home folder. I explain this necessity as I describe the other main folders
on your hard drive.
150
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Your Home folder contains eight folders by default. The following four are the
most important ones:
 Desktop: If you put items (files, folders, applications, or aliases) on the
Desktop, they appear on the Desktop. The files themselves, however, are
actually stored in this folder.
 Documents: This is the place to put all the documents (letters, spread-
sheets, recipes, and novels) that you create.
 Library: Preferences (files containing the settings you create in System
Preferences and other places) are stored in the Library folder, along with
fonts (ones that are only available to you, as described previously in this
chapter), and other stuff to be used by you and only you.
 Public: If you share your Mac, you can’t work inside other users’ folders.
But you can share files with others by storing them in the Public folder
of your Home folder. (Read more about Public folders in Chapter 14.)
Following are a few more tidbits to keep in mind as you dig around your
Home folder:
 If you decide you don’t want an item on the Desktop anymore, delete it
by dragging its icon from the Desktop folder to the Trash or by dragging
its icon from the Desktop itself to the Trash. Both techniques yield the
same effect — the file is in the Trash, where it remains until you empty
the Trash.
 In previous versions of Mac OS, there was no Desktop folder. Items stored
on the Desktop appeared on the Desktop, and that same Desktop was
Figure 6-11:
My Home
folder.
151
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

seen and used by everyone that used this Mac. In Mac OS X, each user
has his or her own Desktop, and the items there are stored in the user’s
Desktop folder.
 The other four folders that you may see in your Home folder are Movies,
Music, Pictures, and Sites. All these folders except Sites are empty until
you (or a program like iTunes or iPhoto, which create files inside these
folders automatically the first time you launch them) put something in
them; Sites contains a few files that your Mac needs if you enable Web
Sharing (in the Sharing System Preferences pane, as I describe in
Chapter 14).
Your Library card
The Library subfolder of your Home folder is the repository of everything
that Mac OS X needs to customize your Mac to your tastes. You won’t spend
much time (if any) adding things to the Library folder or moving them around
within it, but it’s a good idea for you to know what’s in there. In the “Library”
section earlier in this chapter, I discuss the Library folder that’s used to spec-
ify preferences for the Mac as a whole. But this Library folder is all about you
and your stuff.
Be cautious with the Library folder because OS X is very persnickety about
how its folders and files are organized. As I discuss in the “Library” section
earlier in the chapter, you can add and remove items safely from most
Library folders, but leave the folders themselves alone. If you remove or
rename the wrong folder, you could render OS X inoperable. It’s like the old
joke about the guy who said to the doctor, “It hurts when I do that,” and the
doctor replies, “Then don’t do that.”
To find the Library folder, click the Home icon in the Sidebar of any Finder
window and then open the Library folder. You should see several folders there.
The exact number of folders in the Library folder depends on the software
that you install on your Mac — for example, if you have an e-mail account,
you should see a folder called Addresses (if you don’t have an e-mail account,
it won’t be there). Some of the more important standard folders in the
Library folder include the following:
 Documentation: Where some applications store their Help files. Others
store theirs in the main (root-level) public Library folder. 
 Fonts: This folder is empty unless you install your own fonts here. The
fonts that come with Mac OS X aren’t stored here but rather in the
Library folder at root level for everyone who uses this Mac. I discuss
this earlier in this chapter in the “Library” section. If you want to install
fonts that only you have access to, put them in the Fonts folder of your
Library folder.
152
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

To install a font, drag its icon to the folder in which you want to keep the
font. It will only be available when you’re logged in; other users won’t be
able to use a font stored here. To install a font that’s available to anyone
who uses this Mac, drag it into the Fonts folder in the public Library folder,
the one at root level that you see when you open your hard disk’s icon.
If your Mac is set up for multiple users, only users with Administrator
(admin) privileges can put stuff into the public Library folder. (For more
information on admin privileges, check out Chapter 14.)
 Preferences: The files here hold the information about whichever things
you customize in Mac OS X. Whenever you change a system or applica-
tion preference, that info is saved to a file in the Preferences folder.
Don’t mess with the Preferences folder! You should never need to
open or use this folder unless something bad happens — for example, you
suspect that a particular preference file has become corrupted (that is,
damaged). My advice is to just forget about this folder and let it do its job.
Finding Your Stuff, Fast
Even if you follow every single bit of advice provided in this chapter, there
will come a time when you won’t be able to find a file or folder although you
know for certain it’s right there on your hard disk. Somewhere. Fortunately,
Tiger includes a fabulous new technology called Spotlight that can help you
find almost anything on any mounted disk in seconds. Spotlight can
 Search for files
 Search for folders
 Search for text inside documents
 Search for files and folders by their metadata (for example, creation
date, modification date, kind, size, and so on)
Spotlight finds what you’re looking for and then organizes its results logically,
all in the blink of an eye (on most Macs).
Spotlight is both a technology and a feature. The technology is pervasive
throughout Tiger, and is the underlying power behind the search boxes in
many Apple applications and utilities such as Mail, Address Book, System
Preferences, Finder, and others. You can also use it right from the Spotlight
menu, the little magnifying glass on the right side of the menu bar. And, you
can reuse Spotlight searches in the future by turning them into Smart Folders.
Finding files and folders has never been faster or easier than it is in Tiger. So
in this section, I look at the three separate but related ways Spotlight helps
you find files, folders, and even text inside document files — the Search box
in Finder windows, the Spotlight menu, and Smart Folders.
153
Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

The Search box in Finder windows
If you used previous versions of Mac OS X, you may think you know how the
Search box in the toolbar of Finder windows works. But you don’t. Even
though it looks almost the same as before, it is a Search box on major-league
steroids. With its power provided by Spotlight, this is definitely not your
father’s Search box. 
So what’s new and different? Glad you asked. First, notice that the window
changes completely as soon as you type a single character into the Search
box, as shown in Figure 6-12.

154
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

If you choose File➪Find or type its keyboard shortcut (Ô+F), you’ll see the
same thing shown in the bottom window of Figure 6-12.
Notice that the list is sorted into categories and each category can be expanded
and collapsed by clicking the little disclosure triangle to the left of its name.
At the top of the results list are buttons to select where you want to search —
Servers, Computer (selected in the bottom window in Figure 6-12), Home, and
Others.
Or, if the folder or volume you wish to search isn’t Servers, Computer, or
Home, click the Others button and a sheet drops down, allowing you to
choose specific folders or volumes for the search, as shown in Figure 6-13.
For more information on a file or folder, merely click the little “i” at the right
side of it and information about the file or folder appears, as shown in Figure
6-14. If the file is a graphic, video, or audio file, you’ll also see (or hear) a pre-
view of it, as shown in Figure 6-14.

Chapter 6: File Management without Tearing Your Hair Out

After you search, you can open any item in the list by double-clicking it.
Last but not least, if you want to know where a file or folder resides on your
hard disk, look at the very bottom row of the window, where you’ll see the
path to that file (bobl/Music/Smell The Glove XIII, Brown to Blue.
mp3 in Figure 6-14).
So there you have it — fast searches made easy in the Finder. But there are
many ways to access the power of Spotlight and the Search box in the tool-
bar of Finder windows is merely one of them.
Spotlight
Another way to search for files and folders is to use the Spotlight menu 
itself — the aqua magnifying glass icon on the far right in your menu bar. Click
the icon to open Spotlight’s Search box, and then type a character, word, or
series of words in the search box to find an item, as shown in Figure 6-15.
Another way to open the Spotlight search box is with its keyboard shortcut,
which is Ô+Space by default.
You can change this shortcut to whatever you like in the Spotlight System
Preference pane, which I discuss in Chapter 13.
Spotlight is more than just a menu, though. You can also use the Spotlight
Window to create and perform more sophisticated searches, as shown in
Figure 6-16.

Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

You can access this window two ways:
 Click the Show All item in the Spotlight menu (the first item in the list in
Figure 6-15), or use its keyboard shortcut (Ô+Option+Space by default).
You can change this shortcut to whatever you like in the Spotlight
System Preference pane, discussed in Chapter 13.
 In the Spotlight Window, use the column on the right to fine-tune your
search. You can select the way categories are grouped (by kind, date,
people, or a flat list with no categories); how items within each group
are sorted (by name, date, kind, or people); when the item was last used
(any date, today, since yesterday, this week, this month, this year); and
where (Computer, Home, TigerDisk).
When you click an item in this column, the results update to reflect your
choice immediately. The point is, you should use these items whenever
a search results in a huge number of files. For example, click any of the
When items to narrow the date range for your search, or click Group by
Kind if you know you’re searching for a particular type of file (a .doc file,
a PDF file, and so on).
Regardless of which method you choose to invoke it — the Search box in a
Finder window, the Spotlight Search box in the menu bar, or the Spotlight
window — Spotlight saves you time and effort.

Smart Folders
Now, as Steve Jobs is fond of saying near the end of his annual keynote
addresses, “There is one more thing.” Those things are called Smart Folders,
and they let you save a search to reuse in the future.
Smart Folders are updated continuously, so they always find all the files on
your computer that match the search criteria. The difference here is that all
those files will appear in one convenient Smart folder. So, for example, you can
create a Smart Folder that contains all the Microsoft Word files on your system
that you’ve opened in the past week. Or create a Smart Folder that displays
graphics files, but only ones bigger (or smaller) than a specified file size.
The possibilities are endless. And because Smart Folders use alias-like tech-
nology to display items, the actual files reside in only one location — the
folder where you originally put them. In other words, Smart Folders don’t
gather files in a separate place, they gather aliases of files, leaving the origi-
nals right were you stashed them. Neat!
Also, because Spotlight is built deep into the bowels of the Mac OS X file
system and kernel, Smart Folders are always current, even if you’ve added or
deleted files since you created the Smart Folder.
Smart Folders are so useful Apple provides five different ways to create one:
 Choose File➪New Smart Folder.
 Use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Option+N.
 Choose File➪Find.
 Use the keyboard shortcut Ô+F.
 Type at least one character into the Search box in a Finder window.
Once you’ve done any of the above, refine the criteria for your search by
clicking the + button to add a criteria or the – button to delete one. When
you’re satisfied and ready to turn your criteria into a Smart Folder, click the
Save button below the Search box. A sheet drops down so that you can save
it wherever you like, as shown in Figure 6-17.
If you want to add the Smart Folder to the Sidebar, check the Add to Sidebar
check box.
After you create your Smart Folder, you can move it anywhere on any hard
disk and then use it like any other folder. If you want to change the criteria
for a Smart Folder, open it and click the Edit button as shown in Figure 6-18.
When you’re finished editing criteria, click the Save button to resave the
folder with its new criteria. You may be asked if you want to replace the pre-
vious Smart Folder of the same name; you (usually) do.

Haggling with Removable Media
In This Chapter
 Initializing and erasing your disks
 Using PC-formatted disks
 Creating your own CDs and DVDs
 Ejecting disks
I
n this chapter, I show you disk basics: how to format them; how to format
them so that our Windows-using brethren (and sisteren) can use them;
how to eject them; how to copy or move files between disks; and much more.
Onward!
Now, some of you may be thinking, “My Mac doesn’t even have a floppy drive.
Why should I read a whole chapter about disks?” Well, I’ll tell ya. This chapter
offers lots of info that applies to every Mac user — including folder manage-
ment and moving or copying files to and from disks other than your internal
hard drive. I also show you how to work with other types of removable mag-
netic media (such as Zip and Jaz drives), as well as optical media such as CD-
R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and DVD-RAM — all of which many Mac users deal
with regularly. If you have a recently minted Mac, for example, you probably
have an internal Combo drive (plays DVDs and plays and burns CDs) or Apple
SuperDrive (CD + DVD player/burner). Or you may have added an external
USB flash drive, floppy disk drive, Zip, Jaz, or iMation SuperDisk drive which
can read both standard 1.4MB floppies and 120MB iMation SuperDisks (not to
be confused with Apple’s DVD-burning drive, which they call “SuperDrive”).
The bottom line is that removable-media drives allow you to easily copy files
for friends, regardless of whether they use a Mac or a PC, and to move your
files between home and work. And, as you’ll see in Chapter 8, they allow you
to protect your valuable data by backing up your hard disk to another type of
media for safekeeping.

Comprehending Disks
You should think of the disk icons that appear on the Desktop (and/or in the
Places sidebar of Finder windows) as if they were folders. That’s because
your Mac sees disks as nothing but giant folders. When you double-click
them, their contents appear in the Finder window, just like a folder. You can
drag stuff in and out of a disk’s window, and you can manipulate the disk’s
window in all the usual ways, just like a folder. In fact, for all intents and pur-
poses, disks are folders.
The only exception to the disks-are-folders rule that I can think of is that you
can’t use the Duplicate keyboard shortcut (Ô+D) on a disk, although you can
use it on a folder.
Some Disks Need to be Formatted First
Brand-new disks sometimes need to be formatted — prepared to receive
Macintosh files — before they can be used. 
When you pop in an unformatted disk, your Mac will usually pop up a dialog
that asks what you want to do with the disk. One option is usually to format
(or initialize) the disk — that is, to get it ready to record data. If you choose
to format the disk, the Disk Utility program launches itself so you can format
the disk from the Erase tab.
162
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 
Is that a disk or a disc?
So how do you spell this critter, anyway?
Sometimes you see it spelled d-i-s-k; other
times you see it spelled d-i-s-c. If you’re won-
dering what’s up with that, here’s the skinny. 
In the good old days, the only kind of computer
disk was a disk with a k: floppy disk, hard disk,
Bernoulli disk, and so on. Then one day, the
compact disc (you know, a CD) was invented.
And the people who invented it chose to spell it
with a c instead of a k, probably because it’s
round like a discus (think track and field). From
that time on, both spellings have been used
more or less interchangeably.
Now some people will tell you that magnetic
media (floppy, hard, Zip, Jaz, Orb, and so on) are
called disks (spelled with a k). And that optical
media — that is, discs that are read with a laser
(such as CD-ROMs, audio CDs, DVDs, and CD-
RWs) — are called discs (spelled with a c).
Maybe that’s true, but the two terms have been
used pretty much interchangeably for so long
that you can’t depend on the last letter to tell
you whether a disk is magnetic or optical.
The bottom line is that I’m going to compromise
and use the disk spelling throughout this chap-
ter. If you’re offended that I call CD-ROMs, audio
CDs, DVDs, CD-RWs, and such disks instead of
discs, I’m sorry.
My editors made me do it.

If you ever need to format or initialize a blank disk and don’t see the dialog,
all you have to do is open Disk Utility manually (it’s in your Applications/
Utilities folder) and use its Erase tab to format the disk.
Moving and Copying Disk Icons
Moving a file icon from one on-screen disk to another works the same as
moving an icon from one folder to another, with one notable exception: When
you move a file from one disk to another, you automatically make a copy of it,
leaving the original untouched and unmoved. If you want to move a file com-
pletely from one disk to another, you have to delete that leftover original by
dragging it to the Trash or by holding down the Ô key when you drag it.
Copying the entire contents of any disk or volume (floppy, CD, DVD, or exter-
nal hard drive among others) to a new destination works a little differently.
To do this, click the disk’s icon and then, while holding down the Option key,
drag the disk icon onto any folder or disk icon or any open Finder window. 
If you don’t hold down the Option key when you drag a disk icon to another
destination, it creates an alias of the disk (that is, a link back to the original)
instead of a copy of its contents. As you might expect, the alias will be worth-
less after you eject the disk.
When the copy is completed, a folder bearing the same name as the copied
disk appears in the destination folder or disk. The new folder contains each
and every file that was on the disk of the same name.
Surprise: Your PC Disks Work, Too!
One of the most excellent features of Mac OS X (if you have friends unfortu-
nate enough not to own Macs and you want to share files with them) is that it
reads both Mac- and PC-formatted CDs and DVDs without any user interven-
tion. PC disks are formatted for use with personal computers (PCs) that run
Windows. If a friend has a Windows computer, you can read disks he or she
has created by just sticking them in your disk drive. Your unfortunate friend,
on the other hand, can’t do doodly-squat with your Mac-formatted disks —
yet another reason why Macs are better.
Although PC-formatted disks will work in your Mac, the files on them may or
may not. If the files are documents, one of your Mac programs can probably
open them. If the files are Windows programs (these often sport the .exe
suffix, which stands for executable), your Mac won’t be able to do anything
with ’em without additional software designed to run Windows programs.
163
Chapter 7: Haggling with Removable Media

That additional software is the almost-magical Virtual PC from Microsoft
(www.microsoft.com). This program emulates a Pentium-based PC on your
Mac so you can run genuine Microsoft Windows operating systems (Windows
XP Professional or XP Home, Windows 2000, Windows Me, and Windows 98)
on your Mac.
So, with a copy of Virtual PC (around $200), your Mac can run those .exe
files (and most Windows programs as well). Unfortunately, because emulating
a Pentium processor and PC video card demands a lot from your Mac, the
performance you get is slower than even a cheap PC. So although it’s a useful
program for running most Windows applications (including Web browsers,
which run remarkably well under Virtual PC), fast-moving games (such as
Doom, Quake, or Unreal Tournament) are mostly unplayable. Bummer. The
Windows bundled Solitaire game, on the other hand, works pretty well under
Virtual PC.
Burning CDs and DVDs
Apple, or at least Steve Jobs, refers to the Macintosh as “your digital hub”
and has been doing so since January 2001 at Macworld Expo (before Intel
started touting the Pentium 4 as the “center of your digital world”). With Mac
OS X (10.1 or later), this means you can play, create, and publish audio and
video. If your Mac is equipped with a CD-RW or SuperDrive, just insert a
blank CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW disc and you’ll see the alert (as shown
in Figure 7-1) that asks you what you want to do with the disk.
Choose what you want to do from the Action pop-up menu. The default
choice is Open Finder, unless you’ve changed that default in the CDs & DVDs
System Preference pane.
The other choices are Open iTunes and Open Other Application. If you
choose the first, iTunes automatically opens when you insert a blank CD; if
you choose the second, you are first presented with an Open File sheet where
Figure 7-1:
Insert a
blank CD in
your CD-RW
drive and

feel the
burn.
164
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

you can select the application you want to open; then you select the applica-
tion and it opens. If you want to make this action the default so it occurs the
next time you insert a blank disk (and every time thereafter), click the Make
This Action the Default check box. 
Let’s go with Open Finder for now, though: Click the OK button, and your
blank CD mounts (appears as an icon) on the Desktop — just like any other
removable disk — but its distinctive icon tells you that it’s a recordable CD
(or DVD), as shown in Figure 7-2. From that point on, just copy files onto it
until you have it the way you want it. When you’re ready to create your CD,
start to drag the icon, and the Trash will turn into a Burn button (looks like
the warning for radioactivity to me), as shown in Figure 7-3.
Alternatively, you could Control+click the disk’s icon and choose Burn Disc
(yes, Apple spells it with a c) from the contextual menu or select the icon and
choose Burn Disc from the File menu (see Figure 7-4). If you choose Eject,
either from the contextual menu or from the File menu, you’ll be asked
whether you want to burn the disk first.

Chapter 7: Haggling with Removable Media

MP3 players play files in the order that they’re written, which will be alpha-
betically. So, if you want them to play in a particular order, be sure to name
them with sequential numbers at the beginning. Fortunately, iTunes makes
that easy with the Create File Names with Track Number option in your
Importing preferences.
After you’ve chosen to burn a disk, you see the dialog shown in Figure 7-5.
Choose a speed from the Burn Speed pop-up menu; then click the Burn
button, and you’re done.
I usually use a slower (2x), more reliable burn speed unless I’m in a huge
hurry. I have had many discs fail at the higher speeds (we call those discs
“drink coasters”). So I avoid them unless I need to burn a disc really quickly.
Click the Save Burn Folder To check box if you think you might want to burn
another copy of this disc someday.

166
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

Speaking of the Burn Folder, it’s a new Tiger feature and a slick one at that.
Burn Folders are designed to let you burn their contents on a CD or DVD
quickly and easily. There are three ways to create one:
 Choose File➪New Burn Folder.
 Choose New Burn Folder from the Action menu in the toolbar of any
window in the Finder.
 Ctl+click and choose New Burn Folder from the contextual menu.
When you drag a file or folder onto a Burn Folder, Mac OS X sneakily creates an
alias of that file or folder and sticks that in the Burn Folder instead of the origi-
nal file. This has two benefits: First, you don’t have to have two copies of the
file on your hard disk — one to burn and the other stashed wherever it should
be stashed. But the second benefit is even more significant: If you’ve made
changes to files in the Burn Folder, when you burn a CD or DVD in the future, it
will be burned with the latest versions of the files and folders it contains. 
You can use Burn Folders to jury-rig a backup system that’s better than noth-
ing. I show you how in Chapter 8.
Getting Disks Out of Your Mac
You now know almost everything there is to know about disks except one
important thing: how to eject a disk. Piece of cake, actually. Here are several
ways, all simple to remember:
 Click the disk’s icon to select it, and then choose File➪Eject (or use the
keyboard shortcut Ô+E).
 Drag the disk’s icon to the Trash. You’ll notice that when you drag a
disk’s icon, the Trash icon in the Dock changes into an Eject icon, like
that shown in the left margin here.
The preceding method of ejecting a disk is something that used to drive
me (and many others) crazy before Mac OS X. In the olden days, the
Trash icon didn’t change into an Eject icon. And this confused many new
users, who then asked me the same question (over and over and over):
“But doesn’t dragging something to the Trash erase it from your disk?”
 Click the disk icon while holding down the Control key and then choose
Eject from the contextual menu.
There’s one more way if you like little menus on the right side of your menu
bar, as shown in Figure 7-6.
167
Chapter 7: Haggling with Removable Media

To install your own Eject menu, navigate to System/Library/CoreServices/
MenuExtras and then open (double-click) the Eject.menu icon. Your Eject
menu will appear on the right side of your menu bar. 
There are 23 other handy menus in the MenuExtras folder and they’re all
installed the same way — just double-click ’em. You can see a few of mine in
Figure 7-6; from left to right are my AirPort, Sound, Input (the flag), Battery,
and Clock menus.
To move a menu extra after it’s installed on your menu bar, hold down Ô,
click the menu, and then drag left or right.
To remove a menu extra, hold down Ô and drag the menu off the menu bar
and onto the Desktop, as shown on the left in Figure 7-7. It disappears with a
little poof as shown on the right in Figure 7-7.

Back Up Now or Regret It Later
In This Chapter
 Backing up is easy
 Why you should back up
 What happens to you if you don’t back up
 Keeping your disks safe from rogue viruses
A
lthough Macs are generally reliable beasts (especially Macs running
OS X), someday your hard drive will die. I promise. They all do. And if
you don’t back up your hard drive (or at least back up any files that you
can’t afford to lose) before that day comes, chances are good that you’ll
never see your files again. And if you do see them again, it will only be after
paying someone like Scott Gaidano of DriveSavers Data Recovery Service a
king’s ransom, with no guarantee of success.
DriveSavers is the premier recoverer of lost data on hard drives. They under-
stand Mac hard disks quite well, do excellent work, and can often recover
stuff that nobody else could. (Ask the producers of The Simpsons about the
almost-lost episodes.) Understandably, DriveSavers charges accordingly.
Here’s the phone number for DriveSavers: 415-883-4232. Now pray that you
never need it — and if you back up often, you won’t. But if, somehow, none of
this sinks in, tell Scott that I said, “Hi.”
In other words, you absolutely, positively, without question must back up
your files if you don’t want to risk losing them. Just as you adopt the Shut
Down command and make it a habit before turning off your machine, you
must remember to back up important files on your hard drive to another disk
or device, and back them up often.
How often is often? That depends on you. How much work can you afford to
lose? If your answer is that losing everything you did yesterday would put
you out of business, you need to back up daily or possibly twice a day. If you
would only lose a few unimportant letters, you can back up less frequently.

Backing Up Is (Not) Hard to Do
You can back up your hard drive in basically two ways — the brute force
method, or the easy way. Read on to discover both. . . .
Backing up by using the manual, 
brute-force method
The most rudimentary way to back up your files is to do it manually.
Accomplish this by dragging your files a few at a time to another volume —
another hard disk or CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, or DVD-RW. (Don’t forget to actu-
ally burn the disc if you use any of those three- or four-letter acronyms; a drag
is not enough.) By doing so, you’re making a copy of each file that you want
to protect. (See Chapter 7 for more info on removable storage.)
Yuck! If doing a manual backup sounds pretty awful, trust me — it is. This
method takes forever; you can’t really tell whether you copy every file; and
you can’t copy only the files that have been modified since your last backup.
Almost nobody sticks with this method for long.
Of course, if you’re careful to only save files in your Documents folder, as I
suggest several times in this book, you can probably get away with backing up
only that. Or, if you save files in other folders within your Home folder, or have
any files in your Movies, Music, Pictures, or Sites folders (which often contain
files you didn’t specifically save in those folders like your iPhoto photos and
iTunes songs), you should probably consider backing up your entire Home
folder. As you’ll read in a moment, it’s even easier with backup software.
Backing up by using the manual, 
brute-force method with Burn Folders
Adding Burn Folders to the mix makes it slightly easier to burn backups of
important files and folders using the brute force method. If you’re not going
to use real backup software (covered in the following section) to protect your
valuable files, the brute-force with Burn Folder technique will at least protect
your most important files and folders.
As long as you remember to burn discs regularly, of course.
In fact, even though I use Retrospect daily to back up almost everything on
my hard disk, I also used a Burn Folder with the Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger For
Dummies folder in it as a backup of my backups.
170
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 

It’s easy to do. I just created a new Burn Folder and then dragged the Tiger
For Dummies folder onto it. Every day or two I click the Burn button, as
shown in Figure 8-1. An alert asks me to insert a blank disc (unless I already
put one in the drive), and reminds me that I need a disc capable of holding at
least 264.8MB, the size of the Tiger For Dummies folder today.
Another alert asks if I’m sure I want to burn the disc (which, by the way, will
be usable on any Mac or Windows computer), and also offers me the opportu-
nity to rename the disc before it’s burned and choose a burn speed. I click the
Burn button and without any further ado, my backup disc is burned for me.
It’s like déjà vu all over again. I just clicked a Burn button (the one in the Burn
Folder window shown in Figure 8-1) two seconds ago. I understand the need
for consistency, but it seems weird to have to click Burn two or three times
before any actual burning occurs. For what it’s worth, iTunes does the same
thing and worse: If you ignore its flashing Burn icon for long enough, the burn
is aborted and you have to start all over again (and click Burn two or three
more times, I might add).
Backing up by using commercial 
backup software
If you ask me, a good backup program is the best investment you can make.
Frankly, I like the security of knowing that every document I modify today is
being backed up automatically. And that’s what backup software is all about.
Backup software automates the task of backing up, remembering what is on
each backup disk (if your backup uses more than one disk) and backing up
only those files that have been modified since the last backup.
Furthermore, you can instruct your backup software to only back up a cer-
tain folder (Home or Documents) and to ignore the hundreds of megabytes of
stuff that make up OS X, all of which can be easily reinstalled from the Mac
OS X CD-ROM.
Figure 8-1:

Chapter 8: Back Up Now or Regret It Later

Your first backup with commercial software should take anywhere from a few
minutes to many hours and use one or more pieces of optical media — CD-R,
CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, magneto-optical disks — or non-optical media such
as another hard drive or any kind of tape backup. Subsequent backups,
called incremental backups in backup-software parlance, should take only a
few minutes.
If you do incremental backups, be sure to label all the disks you use during
that operation — if you use multiple disks, number them. Your backup soft-
ware may prompt you with a message such as Please insert backup disk
7. If you haven’t labeled your media clearly, you could have a problem figur-
ing out which disk is disk 7.
For some unfathomable reason, Apple has almost never seen fit to provide
backup software with new Macs or include it with Mac OS. I know that some
early-’90s Macintosh Performas had a crummy backup program, and if you
pay the 99 bucks for .Mac, you get Apple’s decent Backup program. But other
than those two attempts, Apple has left millions of Mac owners clueless, for
years, giving them nothing more than a brief passage regarding backing up in
the Macintosh User’s Guide. 
Information on backing up should be in big red letters, in the first chapter of
the guide, and include a warning from the Surgeon General or something. And
it wouldn’t kill Apple to provide a backup utility with OS X, either. Sheesh,
even Windows has a backup command, albeit a lousy one. C’mon, Apple, give
Mac owners a fair shake — include Backup with those $129 OS X upgrades.
Fortunately, plenty of very good backup programs are available for well
under $150, including the excellent Retrospect family of backup solutions
from Dantz Development (www.dantz.com).
Retrospect Desktop protects up to three networked desktops and notebooks
for $129; Retrospect Workgroup protects a single server and up to 20 net-
worked desktops and notebooks for $499; Retrospect Server protects up to
100 networked clients, including Windows and Macintosh desktops and note-
books, as well as Mac OS X servers for $799.
Here’s a nice touch: The included network client (all three versions of
Retrospect use it) runs on Windows XP, Windows 2000 Professional, 
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation, Windows 95/98/Me, Red Hat Linux (versions
6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, and 8), and, of course, Mac OS 9 or X. So if you’ve got any
non-Mac computers, chances are Retrospect can back them up over your
local-area network at no additional expense.
Other backup offerings include TriBackup 3 (around $50) from Tri-Edre
(www.tri-edre.com); and more modest synchronizer programs such as
ChronoSync ($20) from Econ Technologies (www.econtechnologies.com),
or You Synchronize ($50) from You Software (www.yousoftware.com).

Virus trivia
A computer virus, in case you missed it in Time
or Newsweek, is a nasty little piece of computer
code that replicates and spreads from disk to
disk. Most viruses cause your Mac to misbe-
have; some viruses can destroy files or erase
disks with no warning.
The good news is that most virus scares that
you hear and read about won’t affect you (O,
lucky Mac user!) because they are specific to
users of Windows systems. Most viruses are
specific to an operating system — Mac viruses
won’t affect Windows users, Windows viruses
won’t affect Mac users, and so forth. The one
real exception here is a “gift” from the wonder-
ful world of Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, for
example) users: the dreaded macro viruses that
are spread with Word and Excel documents
containing macros written in Microsoft’s VBA
(Visual BASIC for Applications) language. But
you’re even safe from those if you practice safe
computing as I describe.
As it happens, so far almost all the viral activity
affecting OS X involved various Windows macro
virii. In fact, at the time of this writing, I know of
no OS X-specific viruses nor of any that attack
Mac OS X exclusively — and (at least so far)
none that cause damage. Still, the advice in this
chapter is sound — one never knows when the
little boys out there will decide to attack the
Mac. OS X viruses aren’t impossible or nonex-
istent; they just don’t exist in known examples
at this moment in time. But they could someday;
better safe than sorry.
If you use disks that have been inserted in other
computers, you need some form of virus-
detection software. If you download and use
files from Web and File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
sites on the Internet, you need some form of
virus detection as well.
You don’t have too much to worry about if
 You download files only from commercial
online services, such as America Online,
which is very conscientious about viral
infections.
 You use only commercial software and
don’t download files from Web sites with
strange names.
You should definitely worry about virus infec-
tion if
 An unsavory friend told you about a 
Web site called Dan’sDenOfPirated
IllegalStolenBootlegSoftware.
com — and you actually visited it.
 You swap disks with friends regularly.
 You shuttle disks back and forth to other
Macs.
 You use your disks at service bureaus or
copy shops.
 You download files from various and sundry
places on the Internet, even ones that 
don’t sound as slimy as Dan’sDen
OfPiratedIllegalStolenBootleg
Software.com.
 You receive e-mail with attachments (and
open them).
If you’re at risk, do yourself a favor and buy a
commercial antivirus program. Although you
can choose from many shareware and free-
ware antivirus solutions, none that I know of are
as trustworthy as Virex or Norton. The big
advantage of buying a commercial antivirus
program is that the publisher contacts you each
time a virus is discovered — and provides you
with a software update to protect you against
the new strain. (Or, for a fee, the publisher can

If you want the most flexible, top-of-the-line backup software, spend a little
more and pop for Retrospect. It can do everything the others can do — and
more. It’s the only backup software you’ll ever need.
One of the best things about good backup software is that you can set it up to
automate your backups and perform them even if you forget. I use FireWire
hard drives as my backup media of choice, and Retrospect backs up all the
important stuff on my main hard disk four times each day, each time to a dif-
ferent backup set and disk. At night my entire boot drive is duplicated to
another hard disk, giving me a bootable backup I can use in emergencies.
(Where my data is concerned, I sleep pretty well, thanks.)
Why You Need Two Sets of Backups
You’re a good soldier. You back up regularly. You think you’re immune to file
loss or damage.
Now picture yourself in the following scenario:
1. One day you take a DVD disc, or your portable FireWire hard disk to
QuicKopyLazerPrintz to print your résumé on the high-resolution laser
printer there. You make a few changes while at QuicKopyLazerPrintz and
then take the disk home and stick it into your Mac (or connect it if it’s a
FireWire drive). Unbeknownst to you, the disk or document became
infected with a computer virus at QuicKopyLazerPrintz. (I discuss
viruses in the sidebar “Virus trivia,” elsewhere in this chapter.)
2. When you insert or connect the disk, the infection spreads to your boot
drive like wildfire.
3. Then you do a backup. Your backup software, believing that all the
infected files have been recently modified (well, they have been — they
were infected with a virus!), proceeds to back them up. You notice that
174
Part II: Rounding Out Your Basic Training 
send you a new version of the software every
time a new virus is found. But that can get
expensive; new viruses appear every day.)
On the commercial front, two leading virus-
detection utilities are Virex and Norton AntiVirus
(NAV; formerly Symantec Anti-Virus). Each has
its advocates. I’ve used NAV for years and I
have never been infected with a virus. My editor
uses Virex and has also been virus-free. 
You’ll find more info about Virex at: www.
networkassociates.com/us/products/
mcafee/antivirus/desktop/virex.
htm, and more info on Norton AntiVirus at
www.symantec.com/nav/nav_mac/
index.html. 
(continued)

the backup takes a little longer than usual, but otherwise things seem to
be okay.
4. A few days later, your Mac starts acting strangely. You borrow a copy of
an excellent virus-detection software, such as Virex or Norton AntiVirus
(formerly Symantec Anti-Virus), and discover that your hard drive is
infected. “A-ha!” you exclaim. “I’ve been a good little Mac user, backing
up regularly. I’ll just restore everything from my backup disks.”
Not so fast, bucko. The files on your backup disks are also infected!
This scenario demonstrates why you need multiple backups. If you have sev-
eral sets of backup disks, chances are pretty good that one of the sets is clean.
I always keep at least three current sets of backup disks going at any one
time. I use one set on even-numbered days, one on odd-numbered days, and
update the third set once a week and store it somewhere other than my office
(such as a neighbor’s house or a safe deposit box). This scheme ensures that
no matter what happens — even if my office burns, is flooded, is destroyed
by a tornado or a hurricane, or is robbed — I won’t lose more than a few
days’ worth of work. I can live with that.

way you want it (even if that’s retro — ahem — Classic).
Finally, I take you on a tour of the System Preferences appli-
cation, and show you how it lets you customize your Mac
so it’s just the way you like it. (Tailfins and white sidewalls
optional.)

T
hese days, networking online is easier than finding a log to fall off of: You
simply use the Internet to connect your Mac to a wealth of information
residing on computers around the world. Luckily for you, Mac OS X has the
best and most comprehensive Internet tools ever shipped with a Mac operat-
ing system. In this chapter, I cover the top two: the World Wide Web (that’s
the www you see so often in Internet addresses) and e-mail (which stands for
electronic mail). Okay, with Apple’s release of iChat AV, I’m adding a third one:
live chatting.
A Brief Internet Overview
The Internet, which is a giant conglomeration of connected computers, offers
innumerable types of services. Sometimes referred to as the Information
Superhighway, the Internet is a giant worldwide network of computers. With
an Internet connection, you can view text and graphics on your computer,
even if the text and graphics are sitting on a computer in Tokyo. Via the
Internet, you can send and retrieve messages and computer files to and from
almost anywhere in the world — in milliseconds.
Other Internet services include bulletin board discussions called newsgroups,
File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and videoconferencing. After you have your con-
nection set up (I discuss this process in the “Setting Up for Surfing” section
later in this chapter), I urge you to check out these nifty features.

Unfortunately, although these other features are pretty cool, going into much
detail about them is also beyond the purview of this book.
The most interesting part of the Internet, at least in my humble opinion, is
the Web. This is the part of the Internet in which you traverse (that is, surf)
to Web sites and view them on your computer with software called a Web
browser.
Mac OS X offers built-in Internet connectivity right out of the box. For exam-
ple, your machine comes with
 Its own built-in Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) client for making modem
connections to the Internet.
If you don’t even know what a modem is, don’t worry. Skip ahead to the
upcoming section “Setting Up for Surfing,” and all will become clear.
 Apple’s Safari Web browser with which you to navigate the Web, down-
load remote files via FTP, and more.
 The Mail application (for e-mail).
 iChat AV is Apple’s live online chatting client that works with other
iChat users, people using AOL Instant Messaging [AIM] clients, people
using Jabber (an open-source chatting protocol), and Bonjour.
Because most Mac users like things to be easy, Mac OS X includes a cool fea-
ture in its Setup Assistant to help you find and configure an account with an
Internet Service Provider (ISP). After your Internet connection is up and run-
ning, you can use Safari to cruise the Internet (or acquire and use one of the
many other free and commercial Web browsers for OS X, such as Firefox or
OmniWeb).
But before I can talk about browsers, e-mail software, and chatting, I first
have to help you configure your Internet connection. When you’re finished,
you can play with your browsers, mail, and chat applications to your heart’s
content.
Setting Up for Surfing
Before you can surf the Internet, you need to get a few small tasks out of the
way first. In this section, I walk you through them all.
If you’re a typical home user, you need three things to surf the Internet:
180
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

 A modem or other connection to the Internet, such as Digital Subscriber
Line (DSL), cable modem, Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN), or
satellite Internet service.
If you use technology other than a regular (analog) modem, DSL, or
cable modem to connect your computer to the Internet, your network
administrator (the person who you run to at work when something goes
wrong with your computer) or ISP will have to help you set up your Mac
because setting up those other configurations is beyond the scope of
this book.
 An account with an ISP (an Internet Service Provider such as EarthLink
or RoadRunner) or America Online (AOL).
 Mac OS X Tiger default installation.
It starts with the modem
A modem is a small, inexpensive device that turns data (that is, computer
files) into sounds and then squirts those sounds across phone lines. At the
other end, another modem receives these sounds and turns them back into
data (that is, your files). All current Macs include an internal 56 Kbps modem.
Now plug a phone line into the modem. On Macs with internal modems, that
simply means plugging one end of the phone cable into the phone plug-
shaped port on the side or back of your Mac and the other end into a live
phone outlet (or the phone jack on a surge suppressor that has a phone line
running to your phone outlet). If you have an external modem, plug the
phone cable into the modem and plug the modem cable into a USB port.
Finally, plug the modem into an AC power source if it requires AC power
(some don’t because they obtain power from your Mac’s USB port).
The modem port on Macs with internal modems looks a lot like the Ethernet
port, but it’s smaller. You could plug a phone cable into the Ethernet port, but
it wouldn’t fit right and it wouldn’t get you connected to the Internet. The
modem port is the smaller of the two — look for the phone icon next to it.
Conversely, the Ethernet port is the larger of the two. Look for an icon that
looks something like this: <•••>. Check out the differences: Both ports and
their icons appear in the margin (the Ethernet port is on the left).
Just in case you visit a store populated by computer geeks, a phone connec-
tor is called an RJ-11, and an Ethernet connector is called an RJ-45.
181
Chapter 9: Internet-Working

High-speed connections
If you have a cable modem, digital subscriber line (DSL), or other high-speed
Internet connection — or are thinking about getting any of these — you can
use them with your Mac. In most cases, you merely connect your Mac to the
Internet via a cable plugged into the Ethernet port of your Mac and into an
external box, which is either connected to a cable or phone outlet, depending
on what kind of access you have to the Internet. Your cable or DSL installer-
person should set everything up for you. If they don’t, you’ll have to call that
service provider for help — troubleshooting a high-speed connection is
pretty abstruse (which puts it “beyond the purview of this book”).
Your Internet service provider and you
After you make sure that you have a working modem, you have to select a
company to provide you with access to the Internet. These companies are
called Internet service providers (ISPs). Just like when choosing a long-distance
company for your phone, the prices and services that ISPs offer vary, often
from minute to minute. After you make your choice, you can launch and use
Internet Explorer, Mail, iChat AV, or any other Internet application. Keep the
following in mind when choosing an ISP:
 If you’re using a cable modem, your ISP is your cable company. In most
cases, the same applies to DSL — except that your provider is either
your local phone company or an ISP that you’ve chosen to get your ser-
vice connected. In that case, your ISP usually contacts the phone com-
pany and arranges for installation and setup for you.
 If you subscribe to AOL, AOL is your ISP. You don’t need to do anything
more than install the AOL software and log on to AOL. You can ignore
the rest of this chapter except for the parts about surfing the Web, iChat
AV, and Apple’s .Mac (dot-Mac) offerings, and preferences.
You don’t need Mail (the e-mail program included with OS X) if you get
your mail exclusively through AOL, but if you’ve opted for a .Mac
account, you will want to use the Apple Mail application to access it.
In addition to AOL, check out dedicated Internet service companies such as
EarthLink and AT&T. Also investigate what your local cable or phone com-
pany offers. In other words, it pays to shop around for the deal that works
best for you.
The going rate for unlimited access to the Internet, using a modem, is
$10–$25 per month. If your service provider asks for considerably more than
that, find out why. (Note: If you have a cable modem, DSL, or other high-
speed connection, you’ll probably pay at least twice that much.)
182
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

When you installed OS X (assuming you did, and that it didn’t come pre-
installed on your Mac), the Installer program asked you a bunch of questions
about your Internet connection and then set everything up for you. This
process is detailed at the end of the book in the Appendix. If you didn’t have
an Internet connection (an ISP) at that time, you’ll need to configure the
Network System Preferences pane yourself. Although I cover the Network
System Preferences pane in depth in Chapter 13, how to configure it so that
your Mac works with your ISP is something you’ll have to work out with that
ISP. If you have questions or problems not answered by this book, your ISP
should be able to assist you.
And if your ISP can’t help, it’s probably time to try a different ISP.
Browsing the Web with Safari
In this chapter, I concentrate on Safari because it’s the Web browser installed
with OS X Tiger. (For the first time in years, Microsoft Internet Explorer is not
included, which isn’t surprising since Microsoft announced they were discon-
tinuing the Mac version of IE.)
Getting up and running with Safari
Before you can browse the Web, the first step is to open your Web browser.
No problem. As usual, there’s more than one way. You can launch Safari by
183
Chapter 9: Internet-Working
For those who don’t care for Safari
You can use any Internet browser you choose —
such as Netscape, Firefox, OmniWeb, iCab,
Opera, or Chimera — but these browsers are
not installed automatically with OS X (as Safari
is); instead, you have to download and install
them first. You’ll find the latest version of each
by visiting www.versiontracker.com/
macosx and searching for browser.
If you don’t like Safari, I recommend taking a
look at either OmniWeb or Firefox, which are
both filled with features you won’t find in Safari. 
OmniWeb was the first usable third-party
browser for Mac OS X and it’s gotten better and
better over the years; Firefox is a cross-platform,
open source browser from the Mozilla project
and has quickly become the hottest new
browser on the OS X scene. 
Frankly, all the browsers are pretty darned
good, and there’s no penalty for installing a
second, third, or fourth one on your hard disk.
So if you’re not totally satisfied with the included
browser, try some of the others to decide which
you like best.

 Clicking the Safari icon on the Dock (look for the big blue stopwatch)
 Double-clicking the Safari icon in your Applications folder
 Single-clicking a URL link in an e-mail or other document
 Double-clicking a URL link document in the Finder
When you first launch Safari, it automatically connects you to the Internet
and displays the default Apple home page (see Figure 9-1).
If a dialog pops up asking whether you’d like to set Safari as your default
browser, click Yes. If you later change your mind and would prefer a different
browser to be your default, you can change it in the Internet System
Preference pane (covered extensively in Chapter 13).
I don’t have room in this book to describe everything about Safari, but I hit
the highlights from the top of the Safari screen.
“What’s this button do?”
The buttons along the top of the window from left to right — Back/Forward,
Reload/Stop, and Add Bookmark — do pretty much what their names imply.
Play with them a bit, and you’ll see what I mean.
Figure 9-1:
The Apple
home page.
184
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Other available buttons include Home, AutoFill, Text Size, Print, and Bug
(report a bug to Apple); you add or delete them using Customize Address Bar
in Safari’s View menu.
Below the Address field are some “bookmark” buttons that take you directly
to pages that may interest you, such as the Apple Web site, the Apple .Mac
Web site, Amazon.com, eBay, Yahoo, and others.
The News item in this row of buttons is a pop-up (actually a pop-down)
menu, as shown in Figure 9-2. Clicking any of these buttons or choosing one
of the items in the News (or a different) menu transports you to that page.
“Address me as Sir, rodent!”
To the right of the top row of buttons is the Address field. This is where you
type Web addresses, or URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), that you want to
visit. Just type one in and press Return to surf to that site.
Web addresses almost always begin with http://www. But Safari has a cool
trick: If you just type a name, you usually get to the appropriate Web site that
way — without typing http, //, or www. For example, if you type apple in the
Address field and then press Return, you go to http://www.apple.com. Or if
you type doctormacdirect, you’re taken to www.doctormacdirect.com. Try
it — it’s pretty slick.

Chapter 9: Internet-Working

Bookmarks 
Choosing Bookmarks➪Show All Bookmarks, typing the keyboard shortcut
Ô+Option+B, or clicking the Show All Bookmarks button (shown in margin)
brings up the Bookmarks window, as shown in Figure 9-3. 
You can view the contents of any Collection (that is, a folder full of bookmarks)
by clicking its name in the Collections pane. (Figure 9-3 shows, in particular,
the contents of the Bookmarks Bar folder.) Here are the basics of navigating
bookmarks:
 Open bookmarked pages by double-clicking them. 
 Use the Bookmarks menu to add bookmarks or folders. 
 Move bookmarks by dragging them. You can place bookmarks and fold-
ers of bookmarks on the Safari Bookmarks Bar or Menu by dragging
them to the appropriate folder. If you drag a folder of bookmarks to the
Bookmarks Bar folder (or directly onto the Bookmarks Bar itself), the
result is a drop-down menu, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 To delete a bookmark, select it and then press Delete or Backspace.
Figure 9-3:
The
Bookmarks
window in
all its glory.
186
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Bookmarks are favorites, and favorites are bookmarks. Both words describe
the same exact thing — shortcuts to Web sites. In this chapter, I use
Bookmark because that’s what Safari calls them. Some other browsers call
them Favorites.
Your copy of Safari comes pre-loaded with bookmarks that take you to other
nifty Mac sites to check out. You’ll find links to Apple sites, hardware and
software vendors, Mac publications, and more. Take a look at the list of great
Web pages that your pals at Apple have put together. Be sure to explore all
the included bookmarks when you have some time; most, if not all, are worth
knowing more about.
One of the biggest buzzes in Web browsing these days (other than blogs, a
form of Web-published personal journal) is RSS, which stands for Really
Simple Syndication (according to most people who know about it). You see
synopses of what’s available at the site providing the RSS feed — which gives
you an adjustable-length overview with a link to the full story. When a Web
page has an RSS feed (that’s what the special RSS links are called) associated,
you’ll see a little RSS icon at the right end of the address bar, just like the one
in Figure 9-1. Click it and you’ll see all the RSS synopses for the site. 
If you like this RSS thing (and why wouldn’t you?), Safari includes plenty of
interesting feeds to choose from. Click the little book icon (below the Back
arrow near the top of the window), and then click All RSS Feeds collection on
the left. The list of available RSS feeds will appear on the right; double-click
one or more items in the Bookmark list to see its feed.
Searching with Sherlock
Looking for something on the Internet? Check out Sherlock, an application
included with Mac OS X that can help you hunt down just about anything on
the Internet. You can scour general-purpose Internet search engines with the
options under the Internet button or get more specific with one of the nine
other Internet buttons.
In this section, you discover how to find Sherlock, how to use it to search the
Internet, and how to get help with it when all else fails.
Double-click the Sherlock icon in your Applications folder and the Sherlock
window appears, as shown in Figure 9-4.
187
Chapter 9: Internet-Working

A quick look at Sherlock’s features
Before you use Sherlock, I’d like to point out a few of its more important 
features.
The top of the Sherlock window sports a series of buttons. From left to right
they are Channels, Internet, Pictures, Stocks, Movies, Phone Book, eBay,
Flights, Dictionary, Translation, and AppleCare. You click the button that best
represents what you’re searching for. If you’re looking for a Web site, click
Internet. If you want to find where and when a movie is playing near you, click
Movies. If you want to look up a word’s meaning, click Dictionary. And so on.
Although you certainly can use Sherlock’s Dictionary (and it is very good),
you will probably find Dashboard’s Dictionary widget a little more conve-
nient. Check out the Dashboard discussion in Chapter 11. The bottom part of
the Sherlock window is context-sensitive; it changes in response to the partic-
ular button you’ve clicked in the button bar (before a search). Then it dis-
plays the results of your search (after you search, of course).
Searching with Sherlock
You use Sherlock to find things on the Internet. In this section, I first show
you how to search with Sherlock.
Figure 9-4:
It’s
Sherlock’s

screen.
188
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Although I use an Internet search in the steps, you can follow the same steps
to search in any of the other channels. After you know how to search the
Internet with Sherlock, you know how to search any Internet channel with
Sherlock. To use Sherlock, follow these steps:
1. Start Sherlock by double-clicking the Sherlock icon in your
Applications folder.
2. Click one of the 10 Internet buttons to choose a channel.
Figure 9-5 shows the Internet channel.
Yes, I know there are actually 9 icons, but the leftmost icon just describes
what the 10 real search icons do, as you can see in Figure 9-4. Those
appear to the right of the little dividing line, and are actual buttons that
you click to initiate Internet searches.
3. In the text entry field beneath the Sherlock search buttons (labeled
Topic or Description), type a word or a phrase that you want to 
search for.
4. To begin your search, press Return or click the magnifying-glass
button to the right of the text-entry field.
Sherlock passes your request along to the Web search engines and then
displays a list of search results, similar to Figure 9-5.
Figure 9-5:

189
Chapter 9: Internet-Working

5. Click any search site listed along the bottom of Sherlock’s window
(About, Ask Jeeves, Best Site 1st, and so on) to launch your Web
browser and access the search engine directly.
To start a new search, repeat Steps 2 through 5.
Some channels are slightly different in the way they look and work — for
example, the Movies channel (shown in Figure 9-6) doesn’t let you search for
movies by name. Instead, it asks for your city and state or ZIP code and then
displays the movies in a three-column browser. By default, it bases the search
on the address you put in your “this is me” card in Address Book, but you
can specify a different person or address.
The Movies channel offers some nifty extras not found in other channels,
including the movie poster and a QuickTime preview (lower-right pane of
Figure 9-6), plus Add to the Address Book and Map to This Theater buttons
(lower-left in the bottom pane of Figure 9-6). If you click the Map to This
Theater button, you get not only a map, but also driving directions from the
address you gave Movies in the beginning. Slick!
If you like using Sherlock, its Dock icon offers direct access to all of its chan-
nels, as shown in Figure 9-7.

Checking out Help Center
I need to use another weasel-out here. I could write an entire chapter about
using Sherlock, but one of the rules we For Dummies authors must follow is
that our books can’t run 1,000 pages long. So I’m going to give you the next
best thing: Open the Help Center (by choosing Help➪Sherlock Help from the
Sherlock menu bar). A special Sherlock Help window appears; you can search
for any topic here.
Getting Your E-Mail with Mail
Mail is a program that comes with Mac OS X that you use to send, receive,
and organize your e-mail. You can also use Mail to access an address book
that includes the addresses of your friends and family.
You can use other applications to read Internet mail. Mozilla (Thunderbird)
and AOL, for example, have their own mail readers, as does Microsoft Office
(Entourage). And lots of power users like the BBEdit-like editing features in
MailSmith (BareBones Software). But for Macs, the easiest and best mail reader
around (meaning, the best one on your hard drive by default) is probably
Mail. And you can’t beat the price — it’s free!
Mail is fast and easy to use, too. Click the Mail icon on the Dock or double-
click the Mail icon in the Applications folder to launch Mail. The Mail icon
looks like a cancelled postage stamp, as shown in the margin.
Figure 9-7:
The Dock

Chapter 9: Internet-Working

If this is your first time launching Mail, you’ll see a Welcome message asking
if you’d like to see what’s new. If you click Yes, Help Viewer launches and
shows you the What’s New in Mail page.
Mail’s main window looks like Figure 9-8.
Composing a new message
Here’s how to create a new e-mail message:
1. Choose File➪New Message or press Ô+N.
A new window appears; this is where you compose your e-mail message,
as shown in Figure 9-9.
2. Place your cursor in the To field and type someone’s e-mail address.
Use my address (boblevitus@boblevitus.com) if you don’t know
anyone else to send mail to.
After you finish addressing a mail message, you can add the recipient to
your address book. After you add an address to your address book, all
you have to do is type the first few letters of the recipient’s name, and
Mail fills in the entire address for you. Neat, huh? (Choose Help➪Mail
Help to find out more about this feature.) You can even have Mail add
the names and addresses of people who sent you mail by choosing
Message➪Add Sender to Address Book (press Ô+Y) when you’re read-
ing the mail from them.
3. Press the Tab key twice to move your cursor to the Subject text field
and then type a subject for this message.
Figure 9-8:
Mail’s main

192
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

4. Click in the main message portion of the window (refer to Figure 9-8)
and type your message there.
5. When you’re finished writing your message, click the Send button to
send the e-mail immediately or choose File➪Save As Draft to save it in
the Drafts folder so you can work on it later.
If you do save your message to the Drafts folder (so you can write more
later, perhaps), you can send it when you’re ready by opening the Drafts
folder, double-clicking the message, and then clicking the Send button.
Checking your mail
How do you check and open your mail? Easy. Just click the Get Mail button at
the top of the main Mail window (refer to Figure 9-8).
You can configure Mail to send and receive your mail every x minutes by
choosing Mail➪Preferences and then clicking the General icon at the top of
the window. Pull down the Check for New Mail pop-up menu and make a
selection — every 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes — or choose Manually if you
don’t want Mail to check for mail automatically at all. (The default setting is
to check for mail every five minutes.)
Dealing with spam
E-mail is a wonderful thing, but some people out there try to spoil it. If you
think you get a lot of junk mail in your regular mailbox, just wait until some
purveyor of electronic junk mail gets hold of your e-mail address. These

lowlifes share their lists — and before you know it, your e-mail box is flooded
with get-rich-quick schemes, advertisements for pornographic Web sites and
chat rooms, and all the more traditional buy-me junk mail.
Mail comes with a Junk Mail filter that analyzes incoming message subjects,
senders, and contents to determine which ones are likely to contain bulk or
junk mail. When you open Mail for the first time, it’s running in its training
mode, which is how Mail learns to differentiate between what it considers
junk mail and what you consider junk mail; all it needs is your input. Mail will
identify messages it thinks are junk; click the Not Junk button in the brown
bar for any message that isn’t junk mail. Conversely, if a piece of junk mail
slips past Mail’s filters and ends up in the Inbox, select the message and then
click the Junk button in the Mail window’s toolbar.
After a few days (or weeks, depending upon your mail volume), Mail should be
getting it right almost all the time. When you reach that point, choose Auto-
matic mode in the Junk Mail tab of Mail’s Preference pane and Mail will start
moving junk mail automatically out of your Inbox and into a Junk folder, where
you can scan the items quickly and trash them when you’re ready.
If (for some reason that escapes me) you prefer to receive and manually
process your junk mail, you can turn off Junk Mail processing by disabling
it in the Junk Mail tab of Mail’s Preference pane.
Changing your preferences
Actually, Mail’s Preferences are more than you may expect from the name.
This is the control center for Mail — where you
 Create and delete e-mail accounts
 Determine which fonts and colors are used for your messages
 Decide whether to download and save attachments (such as pictures)
 Decide whether you send formatted mail or plain text
 Decide whether to turn on the spell checker
 Decide whether to have an automatic signature appended to your 
messages
 Establish rules to process mail that you receive
If you really want to tap the power of Mail, learn to set Rules. With some cool
rules, you can automatically tag messages with a color, file them in a specific
mailbox, reply to/forward/redirect the messages automatically (handy when
you’re going to be away for a while), automatically reply to messages, or kill-
file them (just delete them without even bothering to look at them — what
better fate for mail from people you hate?).

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

But wait — there’s more!
As I’ve said before, I can offer you some starting points here, but space limita-
tions put a bunch of these features beyond the scope of this book. Even so, you
should find everything perfectly straightforward, possibly with the assistance
of Help➪Mail Help.
I recommend you read the What’s New in Mail entries to learn more about
cool new Tiger features like Smart Mailboxes, Photo Slideshows, improved
searching options, Parental Controls, .Mac synchronization, a connection
doctor, account-specific signatures, and more.
And don’t forget Address Book
Another freebie from Apple is Address Book, which Mail and many other
applications use as a repository for names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail
addresses, and other information about people. Address Book is where you
should store information about your contacts — relatives, friends, or the odd
enemy that you keep in touch with for self-punishment purposes. 
So while it’s not technically part of Mail and isn’t essential to using the
Internet, it is an essential companion to Mail, so I’ll pause here for a quick
look at the multi-talented Address Book.
Follow these steps to create a new entry in the Address Book:
1. Launch the Address Book application by double-clicking its icon in
the Applications folder or clicking its Dock icon.
The Address Book appears. The first time that you open Address Book,
you see two cards: Apple Computer and the one with the personal iden-
tification information you supplied when you created your account.
2. To create a new entry, click the Plus button at the bottom of the
Address Book’s Name column.
An untitled address card appears. The First name text field is initially
selected. (You can tell by the border it now has, as shown in Figure 9-10.)
3. Type the person’s first name in the First text field.
Here I type Doctor.
4. Press Tab.
Your cursor should now be in the Last text field.
You can always move from one field to the next by pressing Tab —
in fact, this shortcut works in almost all Mac programs that have fields
like these. (You can move to the previous field by pressing Shift+Tab.)
195
Chapter 9: Internet-Working

5. Type the last name for the person you’re adding to your Address Book.
Here I type Mac. Continue this process, filling in the rest of the fields
shown in Figure 9-11.
6. When you’re done entering information, click the Edit button to exit
the editing mode.
The contact I created with this step appears in Figure 9-11.
The little contact card is called a vCard (virtual business card).
To add more info about any Address Book entry, select the name in the
Name column (<No Name> in Figure 9-10; you can tell when a name is
selected because it has a gray field behind it), click the Edit button at
the bottom of the Address Book window, and then make your changes.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

You can do scads of pretty neat stuff with Address Book that (you can all say
it along with me this time) I just don’t have room to cover in this book. Just
for starters, you can organize your contacts into groups so you can e-mail
everyone in a group (that you define) with one click. And you can create a
blank e-mail message to a contact by clicking and holding the label next to
the e-mail address and choosing Send Email from the pop-up menu that
appears, as shown in Figure 9-12.
Last but not least, when someone sends you an e-mail message, you can add
that person’s address to your Address Book by choosing Message➪Add Sender
to Address Book (shortcut: Ô+Y).
Adding a sender to your Address Book has an additional benefit — it guards
messages from that person against being mistaken for junk mail. In other
words, your Address Book is a White List for the spam filter; if specific senders
appear in your Address Book, their messages will never be mistakenly marked
as junk mail.
A Quick Overview of .Mac
.Mac (pronounced dot-Mac) is a set of optional, Internet-based services that
integrate nicely with Mac OS X and cost around $100 a year. Although .Mac isn’t
specifically a Mac OS X feature, it is an Internet-based service that I happen
to think is worth paying for (and I do pay for it). So I’d be remiss if I didn’t at
least tell you a little bit about it.
Figure 9-12:
Sending
e-mail to

Address
Book is as

197
Chapter 9: Internet-Working

At the time of this writing, .Mac offers seven services:
 Mac.com and Webmail: An e-mail service that lets you have an e-mail
address in the form of yourname@mac.com. For OS X users, Apple has
added IMAP support and an SMTP server (is that enough geek-speak for
you?). In plain English, that means you can now maintain your messages
on the Apple mail servers. You can also access your Mac.com e-mail
from any computer with an Internet connection and a Web browser
(that’s the Webmail part.)
 iDisk: Your own personal 250MB Internet-based virtual disk. You can
divide your 250MB proportionally between your e-mail and virtual-disk
file storage; initially, each gets a 125MB allocation.
 HomePage: The easiest way I know of to build your own home page.
You can also use iPhoto to build really nice photo gallery pages with
thumbnail images and everything if you’re a .Mac subscriber.
 Backup: A utility to back up folders on your hard disk to either your
iDisk or a CD-R or DVD-R disk.
 iCards: Electronic greeting cards that you can e-mail to your friends.
 Anti-Virus: A copy of the Virex virus-scanning and protection utility,
including regular updates.
 Support: A consolidated link to a variety of support services, such as
Network Status, online discussion boards concerning Apple hardware
and software products, the AppleCare Knowledge Base, and Apple’s cus-
tomer Feedback page.
The first two services — Mac.com and iDisk — are beautifully integrated with
OS X. For example, the aforementioned Mail program is set up to work perfectly
with a Mac.com e-mail account. All you have to do is supply your username
and password. And iDisk is a choice in the Finder’s Go menu, although you
can’t use it until you visit the Apple Web site and create your own Mac.com
account ($100/year).
You can even create a local copy of your iDisk on your hard drive and have
it automatically synchronize with the remote iDisk via the Internet. (See the
.Mac System Preference pane for details.)
Here’s another nice touch: Apple provides a folder full of useful freeware,
shareware, and demonstration versions of software on every iDisk — and it
doesn’t count against your 250MB, either. You may download and try out the
programs at your leisure at no extra cost.
Finally, as the icing on the goodies already mentioned, you also get discounts
and free copies of different programs and games throughout the year. Some
deals are better than others; a few have been particularly sweet.
198
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

I could go on and on, but I won’t. Just surf to http://www.Mac.com if you
want to know more (or to check on the special deals available today).
Communicating via iChat AV
Instant messaging and chat rooms provide for interactive communication
between users all over the world. If you’re into instant messaging, iChat AV
gives you immediate access to all the other users of AOL Instant Messaging
(AIM), Jabber, and .Mac. All you need is their screen name and you’re set to
go. You can even join any AOL chat room just by choosing Go To Chat from
the File menu.
OS X’s built-in Bonjour (Apple used to call it Rendezvous) support makes it
even better. With Bonjour, which offers configuration-free connections, you
don’t have to do anything to be part of a Bonjour network because your Mac
configures itself and joins up automatically. For example, with Bonjour enabled,
I’ve sent and received messages from/to my AirPort-equipped PowerBook
from/to my desktop computer without any network configuration. Just choose
Bonjour from the Window menu and select the person with whom you want
to chat from the Bonjour window.
Your text chats can be one-to-one or they can be group bull sessions. Each
participant’s picture (or icon) appears next to anything he says, which is 
displayed in a cartoon-like thought bubble, as shown in Figure 9-13.
If you’ve attached a picture to a person in your Address Book, you’ll even see
that picture when you iChat with that person. Neat! If you find the thought
bubbles a little too childish, you can turn them off from the View menu.
Figure 9-13:
A chat with
myself.
(I have two
Macs on
the same
network.)
199
Chapter 9: Internet-Working

iChat AV even lets you transfer files, giving you a very convenient way to share
photos or documents without resorting to file sharing or e-mail. Just drag the
document’s icon to the message box, as demonstrated in Figure 9-14, press
Enter or Return, and the file will zip across the ether.
iChat AV is integrated with the Address Book, so you don’t have to enter your
Buddies’ information twice. It also communicates directly with the Mail appli-
cation. Just select a Buddy in iChat AV’s Buddy List, and then choose Send
Email from the Buddies menu (or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Option+E),
and Mail will launch (if it’s not already open), and address a new message to
the selected buddy, ready for you to begin typing.
Gimme an A! Gimme a V!
The greatest iChat feature is audio/video chatting, which is what the AV in its
name stands for. To conduct a video or audio chat, connect a FireWire camera
and/or a supported microphone to your Mac. That’s it — you’re all set to chat
using video and/or audio.
Figure 9-14:
Transferring
a file with
iChat AV.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

And, the latest enhancement to iChat’s AV capabilities is that you can now
conference a video chat with up to three other people at once and audio chat
with up to nine other folks at the same time.
Although many FireWire camcorders work fairly well for video chatting, Apple’s
$149 iSight camera/microphone combination is designed just for this purpose
(and works even better in most cases).
When you’ve got appropriate hardware connected to your Mac, your buddies’
names in the Buddy lists will display little green telephone or camera icons
if they’ve got the right hardware on their end. To start an audio- or video-
conference, click the appropriate green icon(s). Your buddies will receive
an invitation to begin an audio or video chat. If they accept the invitation, a
Video Chat window appears, as shown in Figure 9-15.
iChat’s audio and video features are easy to set up and use.
If you’ve got a FireWire camcorder handy, give it a try. My chat handle is levi-
tus; feel free to invite me to video chat if you see me online.

Chapter 10
Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe
Guide to Printing
In This Chapter
 Connecting a printer
 Using Page Setup to prepare your document for printing
 Printing to most printers
 Mastering the printing process
P
rinting is the process of getting what’s on your screen onto paper. I know
you probably know that, but my editor insisted I start this chapter by
defining printing. And so I have.
Printing under OS X should be as simple as pressing the keyboard shortcut Ô+P
and then pressing the Return or Enter key. Happily, that’s usually just how easy
printing something is; when it isn’t, printing can turn into a raging nightmare.
If you configure your printer and printing software properly, however, printing
is as easy as can be. And that’s pretty darn simple. In this chapter, I scare away
the bogeymen to help you avoid any printing nightmares. I walk you through
the entire process as if you just unpacked a new printer and plugged it in.
If you’re upgrading from a 9.x version of Mac OS, you probably want to work
through these steps because things have changed in OS X.
Before Diving In . . .
Before I even start talking about hooking up printers, you should know a few
essential things. So here’s a little list that tells you just what those things are:
 Read the documentation that came with your specific printer.
Hundreds of different printer makes and models are available for the Mac,
so if I contradict something in your printer manual, follow your manual’s
instructions first. If that effort doesn’t work, try it my way — use the
techniques that you’ll be reading about in the rest of this chapter.

 The Print and Page Setup sheets differ slightly (or even greatly) from
program to program and from printer to printer. Although the examples
I show you in this chapter are representative of what you will probably
encounter, you may come across sheets that look a bit different. For
example, the Print and Page Setup sheets for Microsoft Word include
choices I don’t cover in this chapter (such as Even or Odd Pages Only,
Print Hidden Text, and Print Selection Only). If you see commands in
your Print or Page Setup sheet that I don’t explain in this chapter,
they’re specific to that application; look within its documentation for
explanation. Similarly, Adobe Illustrator CS has added numerous gad-
gets, list boxes, radio buttons, and so forth to the Print dialog to the
point where you might not even recognize it as a Print dialog.
 I use Apple’s bare-bones word processor, TextEdit, for the examples
in this chapter. If you want to follow along, you’ll find TextEdit in your
Applications folder.
 Don’t forget about Mac OS Help. Many programs support this excellent
Apple technology, which can be the fastest way to figure out a feature
that has you stumped. So don’t forget to check the Help menu before
you panic. (I cover the Help menu way back in Chapter 3.)
So, with those things in mind, get ready, set, print!
Ready: Connecting and 
Adding Your Printer
Before you can even think about printing something, you have to connect a
printer to your Mac and then tell OS X that the printer exists. Here’s how.
Connecting your printer
Once again, I must remind you that there are thousands of printer models
that you could connect to your Mac. And each one is a little different from
the next. In other words, if what you’re about to read doesn’t track with the
printer you’re trying to connect, I again implore you to RTFM (that’s Read
The Fine Manual, in case you’re wondering). It should tell you how to load
your ink or toner cartridges.
Remove all the packing material and little strips of tape, some of which you
won’t even see if you don’t know where to look.
That said, here are some very general steps to connect a printer:
204
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

1. Connect the printer to your Mac with the cable snugly attached at
both ends (printer and Mac).
For your printer to work, you have to somehow connect it to a data
source. (Think of your phone — you can’t receive calls without some
sort of connector between the caller and the callee.)
2. Plug the printer’s AC power cord into a power outlet (yup, the regular
kind in the wall, on a power strip, or best of all, on a UPS
[Uninterruptible Power Supply] ).
Some printers require you to plug one end of the AC power cord into the
printer; others have the AC power cord attached permanently. The point
is that your printer won’t work if it’s not connected to a power source.
3. Turn on your printer (check out your manual if you can’t find the
switch).
4. If your printer came with software, install it on your hard drive, fol-
lowing the instructions that came with the printer.
5. (Optional) Restart your Mac. 
You need to do this only if you had to install software and the Installer
told you to restart.
That’s it!
205
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing
Any port on a Mac
Before you can print, you need to plug the printer
cable into the appropriate port on the back of
your Mac, or (in the case of USB or networked
printers) into a USB or Ethernet hub. Therein lies
the rub. Mac technology has changed dramati-
cally since the previous editions of this book,
when I used to say, “Begin by connecting the
printer to the Printer port on the back of your
Mac (with both the Mac and the printer turned
off, of course — but you knew that, didn’t you?).”
Ah, nostalgia. Now I tell you, “You need to plug
the printer cable into the appropriate port. . . .”
Why am I being so vague? Because I have to
be. You see, these days, printers don’t always
connect to the same port. Some printers con-
nect to the Ethernet port or to an Ethernet hub
(which is, in turn, connected to the back of your
Mac). Others connect through the Universal
Serial Bus (USB) port. I’ve even seen a few that
connect via the FireWire port. So read the
instructions that came with your printer — and
plug your printer into the appropriate hole (port)
for your Mac.
Typically, your printer connects to your machine
via a USB, Ethernet, or FireWire cable. Don’t
confuse this item with your printer’s AC power
cord (the kind you find on everyday appliances).
If your printer didn’t come with a cable that fits
into one of the ports on your Mac, contact your
printer manufacturer and ask for one; it’s cheesy
not to provide the proper cable with a printer.
Unfortunately, some manufacturers make print-
ers with different kinds of connectors on the
back (to sell to those poor souls stuck using
Windows) and expect you to buy your own cable.
Asking one of these manufacturers for a cable
will be an exercise in futility.

Setting up a printer for the first time
After you connect your computer and printer with a compatible cable, pro-
vide a power source for your printer, and install the software for your printer,
you’re ready . . . to configure your Mac. (No rest for the weary. You have to do
that so your Mac and your printer can talk to each other.)
The Printer Setup Utility application (which I am about to discuss) is the tool
you use to tell your Mac what printers are available. 
Many of the steps involving Printer Setup Utility require that your printer be
turned on and warmed up (that is, already run through its diagnostics and
startup cycle) beforehand.
206
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 
Checking for AppleTalk if you 
don’t see your printer
If you have an AppleTalk printer but don’t see it
on the list when you click the AppleTalk option
from the pop-up menu (look for the pop-up read-
ing AppleTalk in Figure 10-2), check in System
Preferences to see whether AppleTalk is active.
I cover System Preferences in more detail in
Chapter 13, but here’s a quick rundown on how
you check this:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Apple
menu or by clicking its icon in the Dock.
The System Preferences window opens.
2. Open the Network Preferences pane by
clicking the Network icon in the System
Preferences window.
The System Preferences window turns into
the Network pane.
3. Select Built-in Ethernet from the Show pop-
up menu.
4. Click the AppleTalk button of the Net-
work pane and check to see whether the
Make AppleTalk Active check box is
selected.
5. If the AppleTalk Active check box is not
marked, check (select) it. 
You may have to click the padlock icon at
the bottom-left of the window and enter
an Administrator password to make this
selection.
6. After you make AppleTalk active, quit
System Preferences and go back to the
Printer Setup Utility application (click its
icon on the Dock; or, if you quit or restarted,
launch it — it’s in the Utilities folder inside
your Applications folder) and add your
AppleTalk printer.
For the full story, see the section “Setting
up a printer for the first time,” where I detail
adding your AppleTalk printer.
7. When you’ve added and configured a printer,
you can quit Print Center.

Follow these steps to set up a printer for the first time:
1. Launch Printer Setup Utility.
You’ll find Printer Setup Utility in the Utilities folder, which is inside your
Applications folder. Click the Applications button in the Sidebar of any
Finder window to open the Applications folder. Now open the Utilities
folder and double-click Printer Setup Utility. (Or, if you’re taking my advice
about learning keyboard shortcuts, press Shift+Ô+U to go directly to the
Utilities folder.)
Now, Tiger’s a pretty smart cat — often it will have already recognized
your new printer. If you see your printer listed in the Printer List window
(shown in Figure 10-1), you’re golden and can skip straight to the mater-
ial following Step 3.
If you have never set up a printer on this Mac, Step 2 may be 
superfluous — you’ll see an alert that says, You have no printers avail-
able, and asks, Would you like to add to your list of printers now? If you
click the Add button at the bottom of this alert, the Printer Browser
window and sheet shown in Figure 10-2 appear.
2. Choose Add Printer from the Printers menu or click the Add button in
the Printer List window’s toolbar.
The Printer Browser window appears. You have two choices: 
• If you see your printer’s name and model number in the Printer
Browser list, go on to Step 3.
• If you don’t see your printer in the list, first click the Add button
(the one with a printer and a little plus sign) and then click the
More Printers button: The sheet shown in Figure 10-2 appears. 
Figure 10-1:
Printers

up here.
207
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

3. In the sheet that appears in front of the Printer Browser window, click
the top pop-up menu to select your printer’s connection type.
• Most printers connect in one of two ways: directly to your Mac
(via a USB port) or over a network, using AppleTalk.
• Many USB printers (such as most of the compatible printers from
Epson, Canon, Lexmark, and Hewlett-Packard) are recognized
immediately without your having to perform this step.
• For my example, I choose AppleTalk because the printer I work with
here is an NEC SuperScript 4200N PostScript model, connected to
the Mac via an Ethernet network.
If your printer isn’t recognized at this point, you may have to install its
driver software first, either from the CD that came with the printer or by
downloading the latest driver software from your printer manufacturer’s
Web site.
AppleTalk and USB are by far the most common kinds of printer connec-
tions for Macs. Another option available in the Printer Browser window
is IP Printing. If your printer is on a Transmission Control Protocol/
Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) network, you may need to configure the
printer by using its network address. IP printers usually connect via
Ethernet and are almost always found on large corporate networks.
Fortunately, your network administrator should be able to help you set
up an IP printer; administrators almost always troubleshoot and main-
tain such large networks.
Figure 10-2:

208
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

If you encounter trouble setting up a printer for Mac OS X, you may want
to contact your printer’s manufacturer about getting the latest, greatest
driver. Many printer manufacturers are offering new drivers with enhanced
functionality. You can usually find new drivers for your printer on the
Web or a major Internet service provider, such as America Online. Apple
often includes such new drivers in the Software folder on your iDisk.
And the Mac OS X 10.4 Installer disk may have additional printer drivers
as well. Check with your printer manufacturer for details.
After you choose your printer connection type, you see the names and
kinds of available printers in the Printer Browser sheet’s list. In Figure 10-2,
my PostScript printer’s name, SuperScript 4200, appears.
4. Click the name of the desired printer on the list, and then click the
Add button.
The sheet closes. A new sheet appears in front of the Printer Browser
window, telling you that your new printer is being configured. When that
sheet closes, close the Printer Browser: The Printer List window reappears,
showing the printer that you just added. (If you’ve added printers before,
they appear here, too.)
Now you can print your first document! Before you do, though, make sure
you have the document set up to look just the way you want it to print.
Read through the appropriate section (“Set: Setting Up Your Document
with Page Setup”) later in this chapter for more info.
Set: Setting Up Your Document 
with Page Setup
After you set up your printer, the hard part is over. You should be able to
print a document quickly and easily — right? Not so fast, bucko. Read here
how the features in the Page Setup sheet can help you to solve most basic
printing problems.
Become familiar with Page Setup — you may not need to use it right this
second, but it’s a good friend to know.
Almost every program that can print a document has a Page Setup command
on its File menu. Note that some programs use the name Page Setup, and others
use Print Setup. (Print Setup is the quaint, old-fashioned term, more popular
in the System 6 era and in Windows than on today’s Macs.) Either way, this is
the sheet where you can choose your printer, paper size, page orientation,
and scaling percentage (as shown in Figure 10-3).
209
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

Users of network printers or PostScript printers may see slightly different
versions of the Print and Page Setup sheet. The differences should be minor
enough not to matter.
Click the little question mark in the lower-left corner at any time for additional
help with the Page Setup sheet. If you do, Page Setup help opens immediately
in the Help Viewer. (Okay, maybe not immediately, but Help Viewer in Tiger is
much faster than previous incarnations. . . .)
The options within the Page Setup sheet are as follows:
 Settings: When the default Page Attributes show up in this pop-up menu,
you see what configuration options are available.
 Save As Default: When you have everything configured the way you want
it to be for most documents, choose this option to save the configuration
as your Page Setup defaults.
 Format for: In this pop-up menu, you find the name of the active printer.
If you have several printers configured, you can choose any of them from
this list. As you can see in Figure 10-3, the NEC SuperScript 4200 printer
that I set up earlier in this chapter (see the “Ready: Connecting and Adding
Your Printer” section) is on the menu.
 Paper Size: Use options in this pop-up menu to choose the type of paper
currently in the paper tray of your printer or to choose the size of the
paper that you want to feed manually. The dimensions of the paper that
you can choose appear below its name.
Page Setup sheet settings (including Paper Size) remain in effect until
you change them. For example, when you print an envelope, don’t
forget to change back to Letter before trying to print on letter-sized
paper.
Figure 10-3:
The Page
Setup sheet

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

 Orientation: Choose from options here to tell your printer whether the
page you want to print should be portrait-oriented (like a letter, longer
than it is wide) or landscape-oriented (sideways, wider than it is long).
Click the icons of the little person for the following (from left to right):
Portrait, Landscape facing left, and Landscape facing right. You can see
them in Figure 10-3 to the right of the Orientation heading.
 Scale: Use the Scale control percentages to enlarge or reduce your image
for printing. Just type a new value into the Scale text-entry box, replacing
the default number 100 (shown in Figure 10-3).
Some programs also offer additional Page Setup choices. If your program
offers them, they usually appear in the Settings pop-up menu in the Page
Setup sheet. (Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word have them; TextEdit
doesn’t.)
Go: Printing with the Print Sheet
After you connect and configure your printer and then set up how you want
your document to print, you come to the final steps before that joyous moment
when your printed page pops out of the printer. Navigating the Print sheet is
the last thing standing between you and your output.
Although most Print sheets that you see look like the figures I show in this
chapter, others may differ slightly. The features in the Print sheet are strictly
a function of the program with which you’re printing. Many programs choose
to use the standard-issue Apple sheet as shown in this chapter, but not all do.
If I don’t explain a certain feature in this chapter, chances are good that the
feature is specific to the application or printer you’re using (in which case,
the documentation for that program or printer should offer an explanation).
Printing a document
If everything has gone well so far, the actual act of printing a document is
pretty simple. Just follow the steps here and in a few minutes, pages should
start popping out of your printer like magic. (In the sections that follow, I talk
about some print options that you’ll probably need someday.)
1. Open a document that you want to print.
2. Choose File➪Print (or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+P).
You see the basic Print sheet, as shown in Figure 10-4.
211
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

3. Change any settings that you like in the Print sheet and then click Print.
Wait a few minutes for the network to tell the printer what to do, and
then walk over to your printer to get your document.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 
Dictating perfection . . . sort of
The Print command appears in the File menu in
the vast majority of the Mac programs you’ll see
and use. Every so often you may come across a
program that doesn’t follow these conventions,
but I would say at least 98+ percent of commer-
cial Mac programs put the Print command in the
File menu and use Ô+P for its keyboard shortcut.
One of the best things about the Mac is that
Apple has published a set of guidelines that all
Mac programs should use. Consistency among
programs is one of the Mac’s finest features.
Notice how 98+ percent of all programs house
the Open, Close, Save, Save As, Page Setup,
and Print commands in their File menus and the
Undo, Cut, Copy, and Paste commands in their
Edit menus. That’s the kind of convenience and
consistency that the Macintosh Human Interface
Guidelines recommend.
Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines also rec-
ommend that the keyboard shortcut Ô+P should
be reserved for the command “plain text” unless
it is used for Print, in which case Ô+T should be
used for Plain Text (which works much like the
keyboard shortcuts Ô+B and Ô+I, used to format
bold and italic text, respectively). Bottom line:
Ô+P is almost always the shortcut for the Print
command in the File menu.
My point: Choosing File➪Print (Ô+P) won’t work
for you if any one of the following is true for the
software you’re using:
 The Print command is on a different menu.
 There is no Print command. (Hey, it could
happen.)
 The Print keyboard shortcut is anything
but Ô+P.
If any of the above is true for a program you’re
using, you just have to wing it. Look in all the
menus and check out the product’s documenta-
tion to try to get a handle on the Print command
for that pesky program. You can also write the
software company a brief note mentioning that it
could make things easier on everyone by putting
the Print command in the proper place and using
the generally agreed-upon keyboard shortcut.

Choosing from among different printers
Just as you can in the Page Setup sheet, you can choose which printer you
want to use from the Printer pop-up menu of the Print sheet.
You can choose only from the printers that you have added via the Printer
Setup Utility, as I describe in the section earlier in this chapter (the one I lov-
ingly refer to as “Setting up a printer for the first time”).
Choosing custom settings
If you’ve created a custom group of settings previously, you can choose from
them in the Presets pop-up menu of the Print sheet. I touch more on this fea-
ture in the “Save Custom Settings” section later in this chapter.
The Print sheet also features another pop-up menu initially displaying
Copies & Pages (refer to Figure 10-4) — that offers additional options.
I go through these options and their sub-options, one at a time, in the follow-
ing sections.
Copies & Pages
When you select Copies & Pages in the pop-up menu, you can choose how
many copies to print and the page range that you want to print.
Click in any of the fields in this sheet and then press the Tab key. Your cursor
jumps to the next text field in the sheet; likewise, pressing Shift+Tab and the
cursor jumps to the previous field. This shortcut works in almost any pro-
gram, window, dialog, or Web page that has fields for typing information.
 Copies: In this text field, set how many copies you want to print. The
Print sheet defaults to one copy (1) in most applications, so you’ll prob-
ably see the numeral 1 in the Copies field when the Print sheet appears.
Assuming that’s the case, don’t do anything if you want to print only one
copy. If you want to print more than one copy of your document, high-
light the 1 that appears in the Copies field and replace it by typing in the
number of copies you want.
 Pages: Here you find two radio buttons: All or From. If you want to print
your entire document, select the All option. If you want to print only a
specific page or range of pages, mark the From radio button and then
type the desired page numbers in the From and To text-entry boxes.
213
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

For example, suppose you print a 10-page document — and then notice
a typo on page 2. After you correct your error, you don’t have to reprint
the whole document — only the page with the correction. Reprint only
page 2 by typing a 2 in both the From and To fields. You can type any
valid range of pages (um, you can’t print out page 20 if your document is
only 15 pages long) in the From and To fields.
Layout
Choose Layout from the pop-up menu to set the number of pages per printed
sheet, the layout direction, and whether you prefer a border. (See Figure 10-5.)
 Pages per Sheet: Choose from preset numbers here in this pop-up menu
to set the number of pages that you want to print on each sheet. 
Pages appear on-screen smaller than full size if you use this option.
 Layout Direction: Choose from one of four buttons that govern the way
the small pages are laid out on the printed page.
Click any of these buttons, and the proxy (the rectangle on the left dis-
playing the numbers 1–16 in sequential order in Figure 10-5) also
changes to show you the effect of your choice.
 Border: Your choices from this pop-up menu are none, single hairline,
single thin line, double hairline, and double thin line.
 Two-Sided: If your printer supports two-sided (known as duplex) printing,
the three radio buttons will allow you to specify whether you’re going to
use two-sided printing and, if so, whether you’ll be binding (or stapling)
along the long or short edge of the paper.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Scheduler
The Scheduler lets you set a later time for printing (say, while you’re asleep,
at lunch, or in a meeting). The Scheduler is shown in Figure 10-6.
Printer Features
The options on this sheet vary from printer to printer, but typically include
such settings as print resolution, media type, and whether you’re printing in
color, grayscale, or black and white. Some printers may not offer this sheet.
Summary
When you select Summary in the pop-up menu, you can see the printing
details for your document, as shown in Figure 10-7. Look here for one final
check to verify your print-job settings — how many copies you want, whether
you want them collated, the page range of your print job, your layout
choice(s), whether to save a file as a PDF, plus any settings specific to your
particular printer or the application you’re printing from.
Paper Handling
Use this pane to reverse the order your pages print, or, if you want to print
only the odd or even numbered pages. You can also specify whether the doc-
ument’s paper size is to be used (in which case you might have lines that break
across pages) or whether the output should be scaled to fit the chosen paper
size (this last feature — Destination Paper Size — is new in Tiger).
Figure 10-6:
The Print
Scheduler

215
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

ColorSync
Use this pane to choose a color-conversion method and/or to add a Quartz
filter. The idea here is to get the printed page to look as much like what’s on
your screen as possible.
Quartz filters include Black & White, Blue Tone, Gray Tone, Lightness
Decrease, Lightness Increase, Reduce File Size, and Sepia Tone. They do
pretty much what they say they do when you apply them to a print job.
Print Settings
This pane, if present, offers printer-specific choices such as type of paper,
type of ink, and other settings specific to the selected printer.
Save custom settings
After you finalize the printer settings for Copies & Pages, Layout, Output
Options, and any other options your printer driver provides, choose Save As
from the Presets pop-up menu. Name the settings and from now on, that setting
appears as an option in the Presets pop-up menu. Just choose your saved set
before you print any document with which you want to use it.

Previewing Your Documents
When you click the Preview button, you see a version of the page or pages
that you’re about to print, displayed by the Preview application at a size
small enough to allow you to see the whole page at once, as shown in
Figure 10-8.
If you have any doubt about the way a document will look when you print it,
check out Preview first. When you’re happy with the document preview, just
click the Print button, choose Print from the File menu, or press Ô+P.

Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

Print Preview works with the Preview application that Apple includes with
Mac OS X. With the Preview feature, you do cool things like these:
 See all the pages in your document one by one.
 Zoom in or out to get a different perspective on what you’re about to
send to the printer (pretty cool!).
 Rotate the picture 90 degrees to the left or right.
 Spot errors before you commit to printing something. A little up-front
inspection can save you a lot of paper, ink (or toner), and frustration.
 Add headers and footers. Many applications include (or allow you to
include) header or footer fields to fill in. Headers include information or
page numbers that run at the top of each page, like the ones this book
uses. Footers — you guessed it — are the same thing, but they appear
at the bottom of a page. They aren’t visible while you’re working on
the text of your document, but they do appear in the printed version
(if you set them to). Use Preview to get a look at the header or footer
before you print your document. Just zoom in on that area of the page
to take a closer look; make any desired changes within the application
that created the file.
Check out the Preview program’s View menu and its toolbar. Here you can
zoom in or out, rotate your document, move forward or backward (through
multipage documents), and other stuff. So I urge you to pull down the View
menu and check it out. If you have a multipage document (or multiple docu-
ments) open, a drawer pops out of the side of the window to let you move
through the pages.
To hide and show the drawer, click the Drawer button, choose View➪Drawer,
or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Ô+D.
Just the Fax . . .
OS X includes the capability to fax a document right from the Print sheet.
Just choose Fax from the PDF pop-up menu button at the bottom of every
Print sheet and the sheet becomes the Fax sheet, as shown in Figure 10-9.
To fax a document, choose Fax from the menu that appears when you press
and hold the PDF pop-up menu button on the Print sheet and then type the
fax phone number of the recipient in the To field.
218
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

If you click the button with the silhouette on the right of the To field, you can
select a recipient from the OS X Address Book.
Type a subject name in the Subject field if you so desire, add a dialing prefix if
your phone requires one (such as 1, which most U.S. phones require to dial a
ten-digit, long-distance phone number). Select your modem from the modem
pop-up menu if it’s not already selected (as mine is in Figure 10-9).
Everything else in the Fax sheet is just the same as in the Print sheet, which
you can read all about in the previous sections. Just click the Fax button, and
your fax will be sent.
Before you try to fax something out into the world, make sure you have a
functioning modem — and that it’s configured, set up properly, connected
to a phone line, and turned on. If you don’t, this whole faxing process will
(of course) fail.
Font Mania
Jazz up your documents — or make them a little more serious — with different
fonts. To a computer user, font means typeface — what the characters look
like. Although professional typographers will scream at my generalization, I’ll
go with that definition for now.

In Tiger,
faxing is just
as easy as
printing.

Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

Tens of thousands of different fonts are available for the Macintosh. You
don’t want to use the same font that you’d use for a garage-sale flyer as you
would for a résumé, right? Lucky for you, Mac OS X comes with a bunch of
fonts, as shown in Figure 10-10. Some are pretty predictable, such as Times
New Roman (it’s the font of this paragraph), but OS X gives you some artsy
ones, too, such as Brush Script. If you really get into fonts, you can buy single
fonts and font collections anywhere you can buy software. Plenty of share-
ware and public-domain fonts are also available from online services and
user groups. Some people have thousands of fonts. (Maybe they need to get
out more.)
The pre-installed fonts live in two different folders, both called Fonts. One is
in the Library folder at root level on your hard disk; the other is in the Library
subfolder within the System folder. Both are shown in Figure 10-10.
Figure 10-10:
Mac OS X
includes
these fonts
and plenty
more.
220
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

OS X actually has four different Font folders. A third one, also called Fonts,
is in the Library in your home directory. The upcoming section explains the
subtle distinctions among those three locations. The fourth one is in the
Network/Library folder, and you see it only when you’re connected to a net-
work server.
Installing new fonts
To install any new font, drag its icon into one of the two Fonts folders that
you have access to, as follows:
 If you want other users to be able to access the new font, drag the
font’s icon to the Fonts subfolder inside the Library folder, which is at
the root level of your hard drive. This Fonts folder has universal access.
(The two Library folders are covered in Chapter 6.)
 If you want to limit access to the new font solely to yourself, drag the
font’s icon to the Fonts subfolder (located in the Library folder inside
your home folder — just keep digging and you’ll get there).
The Fonts folder on the right in Figure 10-10 — the one in the Library inside
the System folder — is reserved for OS X and can’t easily be modified. If you
try to remove a font from it — or add one, for that matter — you’ll first have
to “authenticate” yourself as an Administrator.
If you’ve designated a Classic System Folder, OS X will also load any fonts
in its Fonts folder, for a total of five different folders named Fonts. (Some
applications — in particular, high-end design applications like Adobe Illustrator
and Adobe InDesign — add yet another Fonts folder to the mix: the Application
Support folder within the Library folder at the root level of your hard drive.)
You can access any fonts in these out-of the-way-places only when you’re run-
ning the program that installed them.
Types of fonts
There are many font formats with names like OpenType, Mac TrueType,
Windows TrueType, PostScript Type 1, bitmap, and dfont. No problem —
Mac OS X supports them all. In fact, the only font format I know of that OS X
doesn’t support is PostScript Type 3.
221
Chapter 10: Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing

That said, the three most common formats for Macs are TrueType, PostScript
Type 1, and OpenType.
 TrueType fonts: These standard-issue Apple fonts come with Mac OS X.
They’re in common use on Macs as well as on Windows machines. That’s
partly because these fonts are scaleable: They use only a single outline
per font, and your Mac can make their characters bigger or smaller when
you choose a font size in a program.
 Type 1 fonts: These fonts are often referred to as PostScript Type 1 fonts,
and they are the standard for desktop publishing on the Mac (as well
as Windows and UNIX). Tens of thousands of Type 1 fonts are available.
(Not nearly as many high-quality TrueType fonts exist.)
Type 1 fonts come in two pieces: a suitcase to hold the bitmap that tells
the computer how to draw the font on your screen, and a second piece
(called a printer font) that tells the printer how to print the font on a page.
Some Type 1 fonts come with two, three, or four printer fonts, which usu-
ally have related names. Just toss all the parts in the appropriate library
folder, and you’ll have those fonts available in every program you use.
 OpenType fonts: OpenType fonts are really TrueType fonts where
PostScript information is embedded. This gives you the greater typo-
graphic control that high-end typesetters require — while still keeping
the one-file convenience of TrueType.
And that’s about it for printing and fonts. Onward!

Application Overload
In This Chapter
 Checking out applications included with Mac OS X
 Tips for getting the most out of some of them
 A folder chock-full of useful utilities
M
ac OS X comes with a whole folder full of applications — software you
can use to do everything from surfing the Internet to capturing an
image of your Mac’s screen to playing QuickTime movies to checking the
time. In this chapter, I give you a thumbnail view of each application — the
ones I don’t cover here get their due in other chapters — and tell you a bit
about working with applications in Mac OS X.
As is often the case with feature-rich tech, you could write a whole book
about many of the applications I’m about to mention. And once again, space
considerations forbid me to offer more than a brief description of each.
Technically, most of these applications aren’t even part of Mac OS X. Rather,
the vast majority of them are what are known as bundled apps — programs
that come with the operating system but are unrelated to its function. Readers
(bless them) tend to complain when I skip over these goodies, so I mention
them all — but only provide details on those I consider a vital part of the
operating system. Programs that have little or nothing to do with the operat-
ing system (such as TextEdit, iCal, and iTunes) are described only briefly;
programs I consider joined at the hip to Mac OS X Tiger (such as Automator,
AppleScript, Font Book, and many items in the Utilities folder) get the lion’s
share of the ink.
Many software developers often get ideas for cool shareware and commercial
applications from what they find in the Mac OS Applications or Utilities folders.
They look at what Apple has provided for free and say, “Hey, I can add some
cool features to that!” The next thing you know, you have new and improved
versions of Mail, Terminal, Grab, TextEdit, and others. If you use an Apple-
supplied application but find it lacking, check your favorite shareware archive
(www.versiontracker.com or www.macupdate.com are my two favorites)
for a better mousetrap.

Shareware, for those of you who haven’t experienced the joy, is freely distrib-
uted try-before-you-buy software. There’s a lot of it written for Tiger, much of
which is as good as (or better than) commercial software.
Folder Full of Apps
The applications that you get with Mac OS X are all stored in (where else?)
the Applications folder. Hang with me as I run ’em down!
If you want to see them, though, first you need to open the Applications
folder. You can get there in three ways:
 Click the Applications folder in the Places sidebar in any Finder window
 Choose Go➪Applications
 Use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Shift+A
Address Book
Just what you’d expect: The Address Book is the place to store contact infor-
mation for your family, friends, and anyone else of whom you want to keep
track. It works with the Mail application, enabling you to quickly look up e-mail
addresses when you’re ready to send a message. Use it with iChat, too, to
help you quickly chat with your online friends. It can also work with any
other application whose programmers choose to make the connection.
For example, my Sony Ericsson wireless phone can obtain my contact infor-
mation (wirelessly!) from Address Book (through the magic of Bluetooth).
I talk about the Address Book a bit in Chapter 9. For more on Bluetooth, see
the sidebar entitled “Whither Bluetooth?” elsewhere in this chapter.
Apple Graphing Calculator
This venerable piece of visual eye-candy showing off the PowerPCs compu-
tational power disappeared when Apple introduced OS X. But, it has now
returned, better than ever. A quick, visual math instructor, Apple Graphing
Calculator can graph equations in two or three dimensions. You can even plot
out and analyze linear and differential equations, compute integrals, and then
create and save the result.
224
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

AppleScript
AppleScript is “programming for the rest of us.” It can record and play back
things that you do (if the application was written to allow the recording —
Finder, for example, was), such as opening an application or clicking a button.
You can use it to record a script for tasks that you often perform and then
have your Mac perform those tasks for you later. You can write your own
AppleScripts, use those that come with your Mac, or download still others
from the Web. The following sections should give you some indication as to
how much — or how little — you care about AppleScript.
Discovering whether you give a hoot about AppleScript
Describing AppleScript to a Mac beginner is a bit like three blind men describing
an elephant. One man may describe it as the Macintosh’s built-in automation
tool. Another may describe it as an interesting but often-overlooked piece of
enabling technology. The third may liken it to a cassette recorder, recording
and playing back your actions at the keyboard. A fourth (if there were a fourth
in the story) would assure you that it looked like computer code written in a
high-level language.
They would all be correct. AppleScript, a built-in Mac automation tool, is a
little known (at least until recently) enabling technology that works like a cas-
sette recorder for programs that support AppleScript recording. And scripts
do look like computer programs (could that be because they are computer
programs? Hmm . . . ).
If you’re the kind of person who likes to automate as many things as possible,
you may just love AppleScript because it’s a simple programming language
that you can use to create programs that give instructions to your Mac and the
applications running on your Mac. For example, you can create an AppleScript
that launches Mail, checks for new messages, and then quits Mail. The script
could even transfer your mail to a folder of your choice. Of course, Tiger also
introduces Automator, which includes a whole lot of preprogrammed actions
that makes a task like the one just described even easier.
I call AppleScript a time-and-effort enhancer. If you just spend the time and
effort it takes to understand it, using AppleScript will save you oodles of time
and effort down the road.
Therein lies the rub. This stuff is far from simple — entire books have been
written on the subject. So it’s far beyond the purview of a 408-page For Dummies
book. Still, it’s worth learning about if you’d like to script repetitive actions
for future use.
225
Chapter 11: Application Overload

You can put frequently used AppleScripts on the Dock or on your Desktop for
easy access. Apple also provides a script-menu extra that you can install in
your menu bar by double-clicking the AppleScript Utility — along with a
number of free scripts to automate common tasks, many of which are in the
Example Scripts folder. (An alias to that folder is present in the AppleScript
folder.) Furthermore, additional scripts can always be downloaded from
www.apple.com/applescript. Many AppleScripts are designed for use in
the Toolbar of Finder windows, where you can drag and drop items onto
them quickly and easily. There are even more available to enhance your use
of iTunes, iPhoto, and iDVD.
Checking out AppleScript
The Applications folder contains an AppleScript folder, which in turn con-
tains the Script Editor program (plus an alias that takes you to a folder full
of sample AppleScripts).
Script Editor is the application you use to view and edit AppleScripts. Although
more information on Script Editor is beyond the scope of this book, it’s a lot
of fun. And the cool thing is that you can create many AppleScripts without
knowing a thing about programming. Just record a series of actions you want
to repeat — and use Script Editor to save them as a script. If you save your
script as an application (by selecting Application from the Format menu in the
Save sheet), you’ll be able to run that script by just double-clicking its icon.
If the concept of scripting intrigues you, I suggest that you open the Example
Scripts folder and rummage through it to check out the scripts available at
www.apple.com/applescript. When you find a script that looks interesting,
double-click it to launch the Script Editor program where you can examine it
more closely.
Automator
Programming without coding, putting prefabricated activities (known as
actions) together to automate repetitive or scheduled tasks — how cool is that?
Well, if you agree that it’s cool, you’ll want to know more about Automator.
Automator does just what you’d expect: It enables you to automate many
common tasks on your Mac. If it sounds a little like AppleScript to you
(which I discuss in the preceding section), you’re not mistaken — the two
share a common heritage. But this all-new tool (in Tiger) is a lot simpler to
use (albeit less flexible) than AppleScript.
For example, in AppleScript you can have conditionals (if this is true, do that,
otherwise do something else), but Automator is purely sequential (take this,
do that, then do the next thing, and then . . .). 
226
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

The big difference is that conditionals allow AppleScripts to do things involving
decision-making and iteration (while this is true, do these things); Automator
Workflows can’t make decisions or iterate.
The upside to Automator is that you don’t have to know anything about 
programming and you don’t have to type any archaic code. Instead, if you
understand the process you want to automate, you can just drag and drop
Automator’s prefab “Actions” into place and build a Workflow (Automator’s
name for a series of Actions).
There is one thing you do need to know about programming (or computers),
though: Computers are stupid! You heard me right — even your top-of-the-line
dual processor G5 is dumb as a post. Computers only do what you tell them
to do, though they can do it faster and more precisely than you can. But all
computers run on the G.I.G.O. principle — Garbage In/Garbage Out — so if
your instructions are flawed, you’re almost certain to get flawed results.
Another similarity between Automator and AppleScript is that it’s up to the
developers of the applications you want to automate to provide you with the
actions or with scripting support. Not all developers do so. For example, in
Apple’s wonderful iLife ’05 suite of multimedia applications, iTunes, iPhoto,
and iDVD are all AppleScriptable — and they’ve supplied actions for Automator
users. Neither iMovie nor GarageBand, however, support AppleScript or
Automator at this time.
When you launch the Automator application, you see the window in Figure 11-1.
The Library list on the left contains all the applications Automator knows
about which have actions defined for them. It also contains some example
Workflows and any Workflows you’ve created. Select an application or
Workflow on the left and its related actions appear in the Action list. When
you select an action the pane at the bottom of the window (Ask for
Confirmation in Figure 11-1) explains what that action does, what input it
expects, and what result it produces. Just drag actions from the Action list
into the pane on the right to build your workflow.
The Workflow shown in Figure 11-1 is one I created and tested in less than 10
minutes, and it works! Plus, it’s a useful shortcut I use a lot and one I suspect
you may like and use, too. I call it Scale & Mail because that’s what it does —
it takes a selected image file, shrinks it to 25 percent of its original size, opens
the Mail application, creates a new message, and inserts the shrunken image
as an enclosure/attachment. And it all happens automatically, with no human
intervention.
To create this Workflow, I dragged the seven items you see in Figure 11-1 from
the Actions list on the left to the Workflow pane on the right. I clicked the
Run button to test it and it worked. I wanted to make using it easy, so I chose
File➪Save As and saved the Workflow as an Application (by choosing
Application instead of Workflow in the Save As dialog’s File Format menu). 
227
Chapter 11: Application Overload

I saved the application to a convenient location (my desktop) and gave it a
try by dragging and dropping a picture onto it (as shown in Figure 11-2): I
dragged and dropped Picture 9 onto the Scale & Mail Workflow application
icon (top left); the Ask for Confirmation dialog appeared and I clicked OK
(top right); the picture was then reduced in size and enclosed in a new Mail
message (bottom center).
Now, any time I have a big digital picture on my hard disk and want to send it
someone via e-mail, I just drag it onto my handy little Scale & Mail icon and
it’s shrunken and attached in the blink of an eye. 
If you like this automation thing, I encourage you to spend some quality time
messing around with the Example Workflows included in your Automator
Library. They show you a lot about the cool things you can do with your
Automator Workflows.
If you use a Workflow often, you might want to add it to your Dock for even
easier access. (I discuss the Dock in Chapter 2.)
Automator is a very useful addition to Mac OS X; it’s deep, powerful, and
expandable, yet relatively easy to use and master. Do yourself a favor and
spend some time experimenting with ways Automator can save you time and
keystrokes. You won’t regret it.

Calculator
Need to do some quick math? The Calculator application gives you a simple
calculator, with all the basic number-crunching functions that your pocket
calculator has. To use it, you can either click the keys with the mouse or you
can use your numeric keypad (on your keyboard) to type numbers and opera-
tors (math symbols such as +, –, and =). Check out the Calculator in Figure 11-3. 
Calculator now has three modes, Basic, Scientific, and Programmer. Pressing
Ô+2 (View➪Scientific) turns the formerly anemic calculator into a power-
ful scientific calculator, and View➪Programmer (Ô+3) turns it into the

programmer’s friend, letting you display your data in binary, octal, hexadeci-
mal, ASCII, and Unicode as well as performing programming operations like
rotate, shifts, and byte-swaps (the programmers among you know what all
that means, and it really won’t matter to the rest of you). Calculator also offers
a paper tape (View➪Show Paper Tape) to track your computations and if you
want, provide a printed record. It can even speak numbers aloud (Speech➪
Speak Button Pressed and Speech➪Speak).
I find it interesting that until the advent of Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar, the
only thing that had changed about the Calculator since the Mac was invented
was the interface. Then, in Panther, Apple added the paper-tape-and-scientific
mode (called Advanced at the time); now, in Tiger, it’s called the Programmer
mode. No functionality had been added or removed in almost 20 years —
how many computer programs can say that? (For the curious: Calculator was
a Desk Accessory in early versions of the Mac OS and an Apple Menu Item in
versions 8 and 9.)
Chess
This is a visual implementation of the GNU (stands for Gnu’s Not UNIX, but
don’t ask me why) chess-playing game. You can play against the computer at
a variety of settings. Chess is a fairly strong player and should provide a good
contest for any chess player who has less than a master ranking. You can see
what it looks like in Figure 11-4.

Notice that in the figure, the Dock is hovering over the window. Don’t forget
that you can auto-hide the Dock by choosing Ú➪Dock➪Turn Hiding On/Off
(or by pressing Ô+Option+D).
To play a game, launch Chess and then choose Game➪New. If you’re playing
against the computer, you play as white — click a white piece and move it.
The computer responds by moving a black piece, making it your turn again.
Because this is Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies rather than Chess For Dummies,
I won’t even attempt to tell you how to improve your chess game here.
You can tinker with a couple of preferences in the Chess program. To make the
computer a more formidable opponent, choose Chess➪Preferences and drag
the Level slider toward the word Hard. You can also choose to play human-
versus-human or change the name that the computer uses from the rather
unimaginative Computer to something more evocative (maybe Kasparov).
The last option in the Preferences dialog lets you turn Voice Recognition on
or off. (The default is On, which is why you see the circular Speech Recognition
window on the right in Figure 11-4.) If you choose to use it, you press the Esc
key, and then speak your moves (“Knight G1 to F3,” and so on). It works pretty
well but, of course, requires that you have an appropriate microphone con-
nected to your Mac.
If you need a hint (as I often do) to make a good next move, choose Move➪
Hint or press Ô+Shift+H. The program shows you the move that it calculates
to be your best choice, blinking both the piece it thinks you should move and
the square to which you should move it. You don’t have to take the program’s
suggestion — just make a different move if you decide to decline the suggestion.
Dashboard
This is the application icon for Dashboard. You could double-click it to get
immediate access to Dashboard. You probably won’t use it much — clicking
its Dock icon or pressing its keyboard shortcut, F12 by default, are easier
ways to invoke Dashboard.
Dashboard is a way-cool set of widgets, which is what Apple calls mini-
applications that live inside the Dashboard layer. Dashboard takes over your
screen when invoked through any of the three possible ways (as shown in
Figure 11-5).
Widgets function much like desk accessories or Sherlock channels in earlier
versions of Mac OS. Some widgets talk to applications on your hard disk,
such as Address Book, iTunes, or iCal. Others, including Flight Tracker,
Stocks, and Weather, gather information for you via the Internet. 
When you activate Dashboard, your Widgets are displayed in a gray overlay
floating above the Finder and any open applications (iCal in Figure 11-5). 
231
Chapter 11: Application Overload

Each time you invoke Dashboard, widgets that were open last time you used
it will be on your screen. To use other widgets other than the four on your
screen by default, click the Open button (shown in the lower-left corner of
Figure 11-5) to open the Widget Bar, which is shown in Figure 11-6.

Widget Bar sounds like a trendy watering hole downtown, but I assure you
that’s the official, Apple-sanctioned name. Really.
By the way, you can’t remove widgets from the Widget Bar, nor can you
change their order, so don’t bother trying.
To place a widget on-screen, click its icon and it appears in the middle of
your screen, all set to do your bidding, as shown in Figure 11-6. Or, you can
click and drag a widget anywhere on your screen if you prefer.
Click almost anywhere on a widget to move it around on your screen. To put
a widget away, click its Close button — the large X at the upper-left corner of
the widgets in Figure 11-6. If you don’t see an X, press the Option key and
move the pointer over the widget and you will. Also, a close button appears
automatically on all widgets when the Widget Bar is open.
Note that the Dashboard Dock icon is slightly different from other Dock icon
menus. In addition to the familiar Remove from Dock item, you also find More
Widgets, Dashboard Preferences, and Show Dashboard:
 More Widgets launches your Web browser and shows you additional
widgets that you can download and use. (The More Widgets button in
Figure 11-6 does the same.) 
 Dashboard Preferences opens the Dashboard System Preference pane
(which I cover in Chapter 13) immediately.
 Show Dashboard is the same as clicking the Dock icon. Dashboard and
all your widgets appear on-screen.
Think of your Dashboard widgets as handy yet potent mini-programs avail-
able at any time with a keystroke or click. Widgets are just so danged cool, I
want to give a quick look at a couple I consider particularly useful before
moving along.
Translation
The Translation widget could be a lifesaver. You’ve been able to do this trick on
the Web for a while, but now you can do it right on your desktop. This widget
translates words from one language to another. It offers more than a dozen lan-
guage choices including French, German, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Chinese
(shown in Figure 11-7), and more, and can translate in either direction. 
I love the Translation widget so much sometimes, it hurts. 
It’s fun at parties, too. Try this: Type a paragraph or two of your purplest
prose into Translation. Now translate back and forth to any language a few
times. Howl when prose written as, “It was a dark and stormy night when our
heroine met her untimely demise,” turns into something like, “It was one
night dark and stormy where our heroin met an ugly transfer.” It doesn’t get
much better than this, folks. 
233
Chapter 11: Application Overload

I used to leave my PowerBook at home if I wasn’t going to absolutely need it.
But the Translation widget is so wicked-cool and useful, lately I’ve been
taking my PowerBook almost everywhere I go.
Flight Tracker
Flight Tracker, shown in Figure 11-8, can find flights on most airlines and
report the flight’s status in real time — a terrific timesaver when you’ve got
to meet a flight. 
This is a good one; you can open more than one instance of a widget. So if
you’re trying to track two flights, or want to know the weather in more than
one city, just click the appropriate widget in the Widget Bar and another
instance of it appears.
Phone Book
Phone Book (shown in Figure 11-9) is like a yellow page directory. It can
quickly find local (or not local) phone numbers.

Some widgets have More Info buttons, usually in the lower-right corner. Click
it and the widget appears to flip around, exposing its backside and additional
options (see Figure 11-9).
I expect to see lots of Dashboard widgets appear in fairly short order. They can
easily be written in JavaScript, making their development readily accessible
to any competent Web developer. Meanwhile, Figure 11-10 shows you all the
included Widgets at once. Enjoy!

Dictionary
An application version of the dictionary and thesaurus found in Dashboard,
Dictionary provides phonetic listings, definitions, and etymologies for the
words you type into the search box — as well as providing a set of synonyms
and, often, antonyms. The supplied reference works are The New Oxford
American Dictionary and The Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus.
DVD Player
This application is present only on Macs that have an Apple-recognized DVD
player or SuperDrive DVD burner installed. Inserting a DVD into such a Mac
automatically starts the DVD Player. You can then watch the movie on your
Mac, unless you’ve changed the default in the CDs & DVDs System Preferences
(which is to Open DVD Player when you insert a video DVD).
Many external DVD players aren’t recognized and you’ll need to use the soft-
ware that came with it or a tool like vlc (VideoLAN Client) to watch DVDs
inserted into those players.
The System Profiler application (in the Utilities folder) can tell you whether
you’ve got a DVD drive in your Mac. Just launch it and then click the IDE
(ATA) item in the contents column on the left; the details appear on the right.
If you choose Ú➪About this Mac in the Finder, there’s a More Info button.
Click it and System Profiler opens.
The DVD Player comes with a snazzy little on-screen remote control, as
shown in Figure 11-11.
To choose between the vertical (the two on top in Figure 11-11) and the hori-
zontal (bottom two) controllers, choose Controls➪Use Vertical/Horizontal
Controller or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+Option+C.
To open or close the little Controller drawer (as shown top right and bottom
in Figure 11-11), choose Controls➪Open/Close Control Drawer, use the key-
board shortcut Ô+], or click the little pull tab (where you see the arrow
cursor in Figure 11-11) and drag.
The controls themselves should be self-explanatory to anyone who has ever
used a set-top DVD player. If they’re not familiar to you, hover the cursor over
any control and a tool tip will pop up, as shown in Figure 11-12.

Font Book
Font Book lets you view your installed fonts, install new fonts, group your fonts
into collections, and enable and disable installed fonts. If you ever used the
commercial program Extensis Suitcase, Font Book does much the same job.
To install a new font, choose File➪Add Fonts or use the shortcut Ô+O. A stan-
dard Open dialog allows you to select a font or fonts to be installed. Previously
(that is, in Panther), you chose whether the font was to be installed for all
users, just you, or into the Classic environment’s Fonts folder in this Open
dialog. In Tiger, you install new fonts into your Home folder’s Library➪Fonts
folder. You can change the default installation location in the Font Book
Preferences dialog. As shown in Figure 11-13, you can select multiple fonts in
the Open dialog and install them all at once.

To view a font, click its name in the Font list. To change the size of the viewed
font, choose a new size from the drop-down menu in the upper-right corner
(it says “Fit” in Figure 11-14) or move the blue slider on the right side of the
window up or down.
To disable a font so it no longer appears in applications’ Font menus, choose
Edit➪Disable or click the Disable button (the check mark in a square button)
at the bottom of the window.

To enable a previously disabled font, choose Edit➪Enable or click the Enable
button (same as the Disable button) at the bottom of the window.
To create a new font collection, click the + button at the bottom of the
Collection pane, choose File➪New Collection, or use the keyboard shortcut
Ô+N. To add a font to a collection, first choose the All Fonts collection and
then drag the font from the Font list onto the collection in which you want it
placed. To remove a font from a collection, select the Collection, select the
font in the Font list, and choose File➪Remove Font. 
If you remove a font from the All Fonts collection, it disappears permanently.
This action cannot be undone, so be careful when you remove fonts.
iCal
iCal is a wonderful utility that’s a daily/weekly/monthly pocket and desktop
calendar equivalent. You can publish your calendar(s) to a .Mac account or
other compatible (WebDav) server as well as subscribe to calendars that
others publish. Integrated with the Address Book, you can select people who
you want to invite to a scheduled event. Figure 11-15 shows me inviting some
friends to a small shindig.

iChat
Text-based chatting on the Internet is an old and popular pastime. Numer-
ous protocols abound with names such as IRC (Internet Relay Chat), ICQ
(a mnemonic play on I Seek You), AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), and many
others. iChat supports AIM and lets you communicate with other Mac.com
members, Jabber chat users, and users on your local network via Bonjour. You
can even hook up online with anyone connected to AOL’s massive AIM net-
work, including joining AOL chat rooms, even if you aren’t an AOL subscriber.
(Note: You do have to know the chat room’s name.) Figure 11-16 shows me
having a brief conversation with someone we both know and love.
You can even drag and drop files (such as photos from iPhoto) onto the mes-
sage area when you’re chatting with someone, and the file will be sent right
to his or her iChat window! This is way easier than creating an e-mail to send
the file while you’re chatting.
Furthermore, if you have a FireWire DV camcorder or Apple’s iSight camera
connected, you can conduct video chats with iChat, and see and hear the
person on the other end.
Apple has really extended iChat’s AV features by adding conference-call sup-
port to audio and video chats. You can now video-chat with up to three other
users (as shown in Figure 11-17) and audio-chat with up to ten users at once. 
Online meetings: Blessing or curse?
That’s a serious, four-way video conference with me (bottom center, small),

Image Capture
Use this program to transfer images from your Universal Serial Bus (USB) dig-
ital camera, various SmartMedia readers, or from many supported scanners.
If you don’t have such a device, don’t worry about it. If you do have one — and
the software that came with it doesn’t work with OS X (or even if it does) —
try Image Capture.
I discuss Image Capture in a bit more detail in Chapter 19.
Internet Connect
This program replaces the old Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) application in
earlier versions of Mac OS. It is used to configure dial-up telephone modem
connections.
iSync
iSync is Apple’s hot synchronizing software that lets you synchronize your
Address Book entries and iCal calendars with over 20 cell phone models,
your iPod, and/or your PDA (such as Palm, Visor, and others). It also lets you
synchronize your Address Book entries, iCal calendars, and Safari Bookmarks
between multiple Macs in different locations via a .Mac account.

iTunes
iTunes is a great piece of multimedia software from Apple. It lets you play CDs,
create your own audio or MP3 CDs (assuming that you have a CD burner),
play MP3, AIFF, AAC, WAV, and Audible.com files, integrate with your iPod
or other MP3 player, listen to Internet radio stations, and view some rather
pretty visual displays. It is also your interface to the iTunes Music Store,
the world’s leading (legitimate) source of downloadable music. (Whew!)
Mail
Mail is the free e-mail program that comes with OS X. I cover Mail in Chapter 9.
Preview
You use Preview to open, view, and print PDFs as well as most graphics files
(TIFF, JPEG, PICT, and so on). PDF files are formatted documents that include
text and images. User manuals, books, and the like are often distributed as
PDF files. You can’t edit a PDF file with Preview, but you can leaf through its
pages or print it and you can select text and graphics from it, copy them to
the Clipboard, and paste them into documents in other applications. It’s also
the application that pops open when you click the Preview button in the Print
dialog, as described in Chapter 10.
Any OS X program that offers PDF as a file format is one you can print your
own documents from. You do so via the Output Settings pop-up menu choice,
or by using the Save As PDF button found in all OS X 10.2 (and later) Print
dialogs.
QuickTime Player
Use the QuickTime Player to view QuickTime movies or streaming audio and
video. The quickest way to launch it is by clicking its icon on the Dock. It also
opens automatically when you open any QuickTime movie document file.
Safari
Safari is Apple’s Web browser, discussed in some detail in Chapter 9.

Sherlock
I mention Sherlock — the cool search tool you can use to find Web sites,
people, software, stuff to buy, and lots more — in several chapters of this
book. (I will not say “Elementary.” Real Sherlock Holmes fans know he
didn’t either.)
Stickies
Stickies are electronic Post-it™Notes for your Mac. They’re a convenient place
to jot notes or phone numbers. Some Stickies are shown in Figure 11-18.
Stickies are supremely flexible. Move them around on-screen (just drag ’em
by their title bars) and change their text to any font and color you desire by
using the Note menu. Make your Stickies any color you like by using the Color
menu. You can collapse a Stickie by double-clicking its title bar, or print it and
import or export text files from the Stickies application.
If you hover the cursor over a Stickie note (but don’t click), the creation and
modification dates and times pop up in a little tool-tip-style window.
Figure 11-18:
Stickies —
Post-it™
Notes for

243
Chapter 11: Application Overload

Anything that you type on a Stickie is automatically saved as long as you keep
that note open. But when you close a note (by clicking its close box, choosing
File➪Close, or using the keyboard shortcut Ô+W), you lose its contents for-
ever. Fortunately, Stickies give you a warning and a second chance to save
the note in a separate file on your hard drive. You can also export Stickies
(choose File➪Export Text) and save Stickies as plain text, rich-text format
(RTF) files, or as rich-text format with attachments (RTFD) files. The last two
formats support fonts and other formatting that plain-text format does not.
Stickies have grown up in Mac OS X. They work pretty much as they always
have, but now you have more options available, such as a spell checker. You
can also import pre-Mac OS X Stickies and plain-text files. The old Stickies
application supported colors, but not fonts (as Mac OS X Stickies do).
System Preferences
I mention System Preferences throughout this book. For complete details on
setting them, though, check out Chapter 13.
You can open the System Preferences application in any of these three ways:
 Double-click its icon in the Applications folder.
 Click its icon on the Dock.
 Choose System Preferences from the Ú menu.
TextEdit
TextEdit is a word processor/text editor that you can use to write letters, scrib-
ble notes, or open Read Me files. Although it’s not as sophisticated as Apple-
Works, Pages, or Microsoft Word, you can use it for some text formatting and to
check your spelling. TextEdit supports images, too. (Just copy an image in
another program and paste it into a TextEdit document. Or you can use drag-
and-drop to drop an image into a TextEdit document from many applications.)
TextEdit can open Microsoft Word documents. This is fabulous if you don’t
happen to have a copy of Microsoft Word on your hard drive. Neat!
Utilities
Here’s another folder full of stuff. Most of the items in the Utilities folder work
with other applications to do some useful thing. You may never even open
a lot of these applications. The Utilities folder appears in Figure 11-19; stick
with me for a brief tour of each application you find there.
244
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Activity Monitor
In UNIX (the operating system behind Mac OS X), applications and other
things going on behind the scenes are called processes. Each application
(and the operating system itself) can run a number of processes at once.
Activity Monitor was introduced in Panther, but its capabilities will be familiar
to users of previous versions of OS X — it combined the functions of Process
Viewer and CPU Monitor (both discontinued in Panther) and a little bit more,
all in one convenient, easy-to-decipher application.
In Figure 11-20, you see 45 processes running. Interestingly, only four applica-
tions are open (the Finder, Snapz Pro X, Dashboard, and Activity Monitor itself).
To display the three CPU monitor windows on the right of the Activity Monitor
window in Figure 11-20, choose Monitor➪Show CPU Usage (keyboard shortcut
Ô+2), Floating CPU Window (no keyboard shortcut), and/or Show CPU History
(keyboard shortcut Ô+3).
You also select what appears in the Activity Monitor’s Dock icon — CPU Usage,
CPU History, Network Usage, Disk Activity, Memory Usage, or the Activity
Monitor icon — from the Dock Icon submenu in the Monitors menu. All but
the Activity Monitor icon appear “live,” meaning they update every few sec-
onds to reflect the current state of affairs. 
To choose how often these updates occur, use the Monitor➪Update Frequency
submenu.
Figure 11-19:
The Utilities
folder.
245
Chapter 11: Application Overload

But be careful — shorter durations cause Activity Monitor to use more CPU
cycles, which can decrease overall performance.
Finally, the bottom portion of the Activity Monitor window can display one
of five different monitors. Just click the appropriate tab — CPU, System
Memory, Disk Activity, Disk Usage, or Network — to see that particular 
monitor.
Geeks and troubleshooters can use Activity Monitor to identify what processes
are running, which user owns the process, and how much CPU capacity and
memory the process is using. You can even stop a process that you think may
be causing problems for you.
Messing around in Activity Monitor is not a good idea for most users. If you’re
having problems with an application or with Mac OS X, try quitting open
applications, force-quitting applications (press Ô+Option+Esc — the Mac
“three-finger salute”), or logging out and then logging back in again before
you start mucking around with processes.
AirPort Admin Utility
You use AirPort Admin Utility to change individual Internet settings of an
AirPort Base Station, such as the phone number of your Internet service
provider (ISP).

AirPort Setup Assistant
The name is pretty self-explanatory. You run this program to configure your
AirPort card for wireless networking.
Audio MIDI Setup
This program is the control center for any MIDI devices built into or con-
nected to your Mac.
Bluetooth File Exchange
If you have a Bluetooth device and your Mac has a Bluetooth adapter con-
nected to a USB port (or has Bluetooth built in, although no Mac has it at the
time of this writing), you can drag icons for Address Book items (vCard files),
iCal items (vCal files), and pictures (.gif files) onto the Bluetooth File Exchange
icon to copy the file from your Mac to the Bluetooth device — wirelessly —
via Bluetooth.
ColorSync Utility
This single-purpose program verifies the contents of the color-matching pro-
files installed on your Mac. If you don’t use ColorSync (Apple’s color-matching
technology to ensure what you see on-screen is the same as what you print
on any device), don’t worry about it.
247
Chapter 11: Application Overload
Whither Bluetooth?
Bluetooth is an upcoming standard for wireless
communication between intelligent devices over
short distances. At least that’s my definition.
One of the first devices that came on the market
is the Sony Ericsson T68i wireless phone I’ve
been using.
Bluetooth is a smart protocol. When two
Bluetooth devices have been prepared (actually,
paired), they recognize each other when they’re
within range — 20–30 feet — and then they
automatically perform whatever task they were
instructed to perform when they were paired.
My phone can receive calendar items, con-
tacts, and little pictures from my Mac. And I can
back up the phone’s memory to my Mac’s hard
disk as well. If I attach the Bluetooth adapter to
my PowerBook, I can use the phone as a wire-
less modem and surf the Internet or check my
e-mail from the beach if I want to, just like on TV.
(Now, where’s that cold beer?)
What AirPort is to wireless networking, Bluetooth
is to intelligent wireless peripheral connections.
Bluetooth isn’t very fast and has a limited range
(around 20–30 feet from your Mac). But it’s swell
for sending small amounts of data back and forth
between devices. Watch for devices that you
currently use via USB (digital cameras, printers,
and such) to offer Bluetooth connectivity soon.
Warning: If your Mac doesn’t have Bluetooth
built-in (or a Bluetooth adapter connected to it)
and you try to launch any of the three Bluetooth
utilities, they alert you that your Mac doesn’t
have the proper Bluetooth hardware connected
to it — and they refuse to launch.

Console
Mac OS X is based on an operating system called UNIX, a powerful operating
system with lots of incredibly geeky features and capabilities that most Mac
users don’t really want to know about (and that Apple hides from you unless
you want to work with them). But for those who want to find out what’s going
on under the hood of Mac OS X (or even to tinker around with the engine),
the Console application provides a window into the deep, dark world of UNIX.
Console displays system messages that can help you troubleshoot problems
with Mac OS X — provided you know how to interpret them. If you’ve never
learned conversational UNIX, don’t let it scare you — most folks never need
Console.
DigitalColor Meter
This is a little program that displays what’s on your screen as numerical
color values, according to two different systems: RGB (red-green-blue) or CIE
(the abbreviation for a chromaticity coordinate system developed by the
Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage, the international commission on
illumination). If you’re not a graphic artist or otherwise involved in the pro-
duction of high-end color documents, you’ll almost certainly never need it.
Directory Access
This little program is meant for system administrators on large networks. If
your computer is connected to a campus or corporate network, talk to your
network administrator about these settings.
If you’re a home user with no vast cube farm to manage, just ignore this 
program.
Disk Utility
If you’re having problems with your hard drive or need to make changes to it,
Disk Utility is a good place to start. This application has five active compo-
nents: First Aid, Erase, Partition, RAID, and Restore.
First Aid
If you suspect something’s not quite right with your Mac, the First Aid portion
of Disk Utility should be among your first stops. Use First Aid to verify and (if
necessary) repair an ailing drive. To use it, click the First Aid button on the left
side of the Disk Utility window. Click a volume’s icon and then click Verify. You
get information about any problems that the software finds. If First Aid doesn’t
find any problems, you can go on your merry way, secure in the knowledge
that your Mac is A-OK. If verification turns up trouble, click Repair to have the
problem fixed. You can also use First Aid to fix disk permission problems.
You won’t be able to use the copy of Disk Utility in your Applications/Utilities
folder to repair your OS X boot disk. To do that, you must reboot from the
Mac OS X CD and run the copy of Disk Utility found on that CD-ROM.
248
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

You can’t use Disk Utility First Aid to fix a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM disk, nor can
it fix most disk image files. These disks are read-only and can’t be altered.
You can fix Zip disks, SuperDisks, DVD-RAM discs, or any other writeable
media that can be mounted by your Mac.
Erase
Use Erase to format (completely erase) a disk. You can’t do this to the startup
disk — the one with Mac OS X on it.
When you format a disk, you erase all information on it, permanently. Format-
ting can’t be undone — unless you are absolutely sure this is what you want
to do, don’t do it. Unless you have no use for whatever’s currently on the disk,
make a complete backup of the disk before you format it. If the data is criti-
cal, you should have at least two (or even three) known-to-be-valid backup
copies of that disk before you reformat.
Partition
Use this tab to create disk partitions (multiple volumes on a single disk),
each of which is treated as a separate disk by OS X.
RAID
By using Redundant Array of Individual Disks (RAID), you can treat multiple
disks as a single volume, which is sort of the opposite of partitioning.
249
Chapter 11: Application Overload
Of partitions and volumes
Partitioning a drive lets you create multiple vol-
umes. A volume is a storage space that (from
the Mac’s point of view) looks and acts just like
a hard drive; a partition is simply a designated
volume on a drive, completely separate from all
other partitions (volumes). You can create any
number of partitions, but it’s a good idea to limit
yourself to no more than a small handful. Lots of
people, including me, use one partition for Mac
OS X and another for Mac OS 9.
You can only create drive partitions on a newly
formatted drive. So to partition a drive, first
format it in Drive Setup and then create parti-
tions. Before you do that, give some thought to
how large a partition you want to create. You
won’t be able to change your mind about it later.
I think that partitions should be no smaller than
2GB. You can get away with 1GB if you have a 6GB
or smaller drive, but you don’t need to create a lot
of little partitions just to store your stuff. Instead,
use folders: They work just great for organizing
things the way you like. The one exception to
this rule is if you burn a lot of CDs with your CD-
RW drive. In that case, a 650MB or 700MB (if
you use that size CD) partition lets you prototype
your CDs before you burn them — set up the
content and check to see just how much stuff will
fit on a single 650MB or 700MB disk. Of course,
creating disk-image files of those sizes would
leave the space free for other uses when you
aren’t prototyping.
By the same token, you should limit the number
of partitions you create. A PowerMac G4 with a
20GB drive does just fine with two (or maybe
three) partitions.

Restore
Use the Restore tab to restore your Mac to factory-fresh condition from a
CD-ROM or disk-image file.
Speaking of disk images (and I will be in a minute), Disk Utility contains the
functionality formerly found in the now-discontinued Disk Copy program.
In most cases, you install new software on your Mac from a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM,
or by downloading it from the Internet. Software vendors typically use an
installer program that decompresses and copies files to their proper places on
your hard drive. After you’ve installed the software, you’re back in business.
Apple’s variation on this theme is a humongous file called the disk image —
everything you’d normally find on a disk, without the disk. These days more
developers are adopting the disk-image format for their downloadable installers
and updaters. When mounted on your Desktop (more on what mounting means
in a minute), a disk image looks and acts just like a real disk. You can open it
and see its contents in a Finder window, copy files from its window to another
disk, drag it to the Eject button to remove it from your Desktop — go wild.
To make a disk image appear on your Desktop, you double-click the image
file. At that point, the Disk Utility application takes over and puts an icon
(which for all intents and purposes looks like a disk) on your Desktop.
Disk Utility not only mounts images when you double-click them, it can also
be used to create your own disk-image files and burn them onto CD-ROMs
and DVD-ROMs.
Because disk images can be transferred via the Internet — and because they
act just like disks — they’re a great substitute for a CD-ROM or other disk-
based software installer. A software maker can create both a CD version of
an installer and a disk image that can be downloaded.
Grab
Want to take a picture of your screen? I used to do this a lot so that I could
bring you the screen shots (what you see in the figures) in this book. You can
use Grab to take a picture of all or part of the screen, and then save that file
for printing or sending around (say, to all your screaming fans who want to
see your Desktop pattern or how you’ve organized your windows). The first
edition of this book used Grab, but I used the superb Snapz Pro X utility
(Ambrosia Software; www.ambrosiasw.com) for the figures in subsequent 
editions. It’s definitely worth the shareware fee.
Grab’s best feature is its capability to do a timed screen capture. Like those
cameras that let you start the timer and then run to get into the shot, Grab
gives you ten seconds to bring the window you want to the front, pull down
a menu, get the cursor out of the way, or whatever you need to do to get the
screen just right.
250
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Grab’s default behavior is to display no cursor. If you want to show a cursor
in your screen shots, choose Grab➪Preferences and then select a pointer
(from the ten choices in the Preference dialog) by clicking it. To have no
cursor, click the topmost, leftmost item, which is an empty box (that indi-
cates no cursor).
Installer
Here’s an application that you’ll never need to open yourself. But don’t get
rid of it — software developers, including Apple, write installer scripts that
automate the process of putting software on your Mac (that’s what all those
.pkg and .mpkg file extensions are about). These scripts know where every-
thing should go and in what order — and in order to run, those installer scripts
need to find this little program. If you simply leave this critter alone to snooze
in peace, everything will be hunky-dory.
Java
This folder contains three tools for using the versatile and powerful Java lan-
guage with your Mac:
 Input Method Hot Key: This is what you use to designate a hot key that
allows you to select from multiple input methods in a pop-up menu.
The hot key is available only while a Java application is the active 
application.
 Java Plugin Settings (one for version 1.3.1; another for version 1.4.2):
This is a control panel for Java and plug-ins that you may run in your
Web browser.
 Java Web Start: This nifty little tool lets you launch full-featured applica-
tions written in the Java language with a single click from within your
Web browser. One big advantage of an application written in Java is that
you don’t have to wait for the publisher to create a Mac OS X version.
The same Java code that runs on Windows or Linux or Solaris (Sun’s ver-
sion of UNIX) will run on Mac OS X and inherit the Mac OS X interface.
Keychain Access
A keychain is a way to consolidate all your passwords — the one you use to
log into your Mac, your e-mail password, and passwords required by any Web
sites. Here’s how it works: You use a single password to unlock your keychain
(which holds your various passwords) and then you don’t have to remember
all your other passwords. Rest assured that your passwords are secure because
only a user who has your keychain password can reach the other password-
protected applications.
To create a new keychain, choose File➪New Keychain.
To add passwords to the keychain, you must first create a keychain and a
password for it. Then you can add passwords to the chain.
251
Chapter 11: Application Overload

After you set up a keychain, you can just open Mail or another application that
supports the keychain. When the program asks for your password, supply it
and choose Yes to add the password to the keychain.
How do you know which programs support the Keychain utility? You don’t
until you’re prompted to save your password in a keychain in that Open dialog,
connect window, or so forth. If a program supports Keychain, it offers a check
box for it in the user ID/password dialog or window.
The Keychain utility is particularly cool if you have multiple e-mail accounts
and each one has a different password. Just add them all to your keychain,
and you can get all your mail at once with one password.
To add a Web site password to a keychain, open the Keychain Access applica-
tion and click the Password button. In the New Password Item window that
opens, type the URL of the site in the Keychain Item Name text field, type
your username in the Account Name field, and then type your password in
the Password text field, as shown in Figure 11-21.
To use the new URL password, double-click the URL in the Keychain Access
window. A small Get Info window will pop up. Click the Go There button to
launch your browser (if it isn’t already running) — you’re whisked away and
logged in to the Web site you choose.
Migration Assistant
This is pretty much a one-trick pony, but that pony is a prizewinner. You use
the Migration Assistant to transfer your account and other user information
from another Mac or another volume on the current Mac to this one. You need
to authenticate as an Administrator to use it, but it’s a pretty handy way to
transfer an account without having to recreate all the preferences and other
Figure 11-21:

252
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

settings. When you first installed Tiger (or when you booted your nice new
Tiger-based Mac for the first time), the setup utility asked you whether you
wanted to transfer your information from another Mac — if you answered in
the affirmative, it ran the Migration Assistant.
NetInfo Manager
Here’s another little program for system administrators on large networks or
power-user administrators of shared Macs. If you’re a home user who hasn’t
set up an empire yet, just ignore it.
Network Utility
And here is yet another little program for system administrators on large net-
works. But unlike the others (the ones I’ve told you to ignore if you’re a home
user), this one can come in handy if you’re a veteran Internet user. It offers
common Internet utility functions such as ping, traceroute, whois, finger,
and such. If those terms look like gibberish, you can ignore this program and
you’ll still be fine.
ODBC Administrator
If you have to access corporate databases using Open Database Connectivity
(ODBC), your database administrator will give you the settings that you need
to plug into this tool. If you’re not going to be doing that, skip this tool.
Printer Setup Utility
Printer Setup Utility is the program that you use to configure your Mac to use
printers and to manage print jobs. I discuss Print Center in Chapter 10.
System Profiler
System Profiler is a little program that gives you information about your Mac.
(What a concept!) If you’re curious about arcane questions such as what
processor your Mac has or what devices are currently connected to it, give
the Profiler a try. Poke around the Commands menu and check it out; this
little puppy is benign and won’t hurt anything.
If you ever have occasion to call for technical support for your Mac, software,
or peripherals, you’re probably going to be asked to provide information
from System Profiler. So don’t get rid of it just because you don’t care about
this kind of stuff.
Terminal
Mac OS X is based on UNIX. If you need proof — or if you actually want to oper-
ate your Mac as the UNIX machine that it is — Terminal is the place to start.
253
Chapter 11: Application Overload

Because UNIX is a command-line-based operating system, you use Terminal
to type in your commands. You can issue commands that show a directory
listing, copy and move files, search for filenames or contents, or establish or
change passwords. In short, if you know what you’re doing, you can do
everything on the command line that you can do in Mac OS X. For most
folks, that’s not a desirable alternative to the windows-and-icons of the
Finder window. But take my word for it; true geeks who are also Mac lovers
get all misty-eyed about the combination of a command line and a graphical
user interface.
If you do decide to tinker with Terminal and the UNIX-y innards of Mac OS X,
please take some time to bone up on UNIX itself. Everything you learn about
UNIX will work on your Mac OS X. A good book on the subject is Learning the
UNIX Operating System (Nutshell Handbook) by Jerry Peek, Grace Todino, and
John Strang. Or try UNIX Visual QuickStart Guide by Deborah S. Ray and Eric
J. Ray — the UNIX book I keep on my own desk, just in case.
VoiceOver Utility
The Mac, from its very introduction in 1984, has been vocal. Concurrent with
the Quadra line, Apple introduced text-to-speech capability — and Casper, its
voice-recognition software — back in 1991.
VoiceOver is the next evolutionary step for text-to-speech. In addition to read-
ing what’s on the screen to you, VoiceOver integrates with your keyboard so
you can navigate around the screen until you hear the item you’re looking for.
Once you’re there, you can use Keyboard Access to select list items, click
check boxes and radio buttons, move scrollbars and sliders, resize windows,
and so on — with a simple keypress or two. (I discuss this in Chapter 13 on
System Preferences.)
Apple considers the VoiceOver Utility so important that it received one of the
pre-canned keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Option+F8.
Rather than waste a bunch of words on a feature designed for those with
impaired vision, let me show you all the options in one picture, Figure 11-22.
It ought to be worth at least a thousand words.
I can only give you a hint of how cool this is; you can’t hear what’s happening
from reading this book. VoiceOver Utility Help is extensive, clear, and really
shows off the power-and-cool factor. Of course, you might get the machines-are-
taking-over willies when your Mac starts to talk to you or make sounds — but
if you give it a try, it could change your mind.

In This Chapter

M
ac OS X is capable of running two different operating systems. Mac OS X,
of course, runs your machine, but Mac OS 9.2.2 — the Mac OS version
that was in use just before Mac OS X — is available too, if you need it.
Why would Apple give you two operating systems, and what in the world do
you do with more than one? I explain this in the following section, and later I
explain how two operating systems on one computer work together, how you
can use them, and why you would want to.
Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger requires version 9.2.2 of Mac OS to provide the
Classic environment. But most (if not all) programs don’t distinguish between
Mac OS 9, 9.0.1, 9.0.2, 9.0.3, 9.0.4, 9.1, 9.2, 9.2.1, and 9.2.2. So when I call a pro-
gram a Mac OS 9 program, what I mean is that it’s not an OS X program and
that it will (usually) run under any version of Mac OS 9.
In essence, when I talk about stuff that works with (or appears in) all ver-
sions of Mac OS 9, I say Mac OS 9 or Mac OS 9.x. When I’m talking about
Classic — or another feature or program that requires OS 9 version 9.2.2 —
I say Mac OS 9.2.2.
If you’re not sure whether to — or how to — install Classic on your system, see
the Appendix of this book, where I discuss the different ways to install Classic.

You Can Call It Classic
Mac OS X is the software that controls your Mac (as I describe in Chapter 1) —
it’s the magic that starts your computer, displays the Desktop, and gives
you access to all the tools you use every day to work with your files and
applications.
Mac OS 9.2.2, called Classic when running under Mac OS X, actually runs
inside an operating system (OS) emulator — software that does most, but not
all, of what an operating system does by pretending to be one. When you
launch an older application, it’s as if you’ve booted a computer within your
computer; that is, Classic first emulates the OS 9 startup process, loading all
the extensions and control panels that it needs to mimic Mac OS 9.2.2 and
run the application.
Retail boxed copies of Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger don’t include a Mac OS 9
installation CD. Classic is supported fully, but you have to come up with your
own Mac OS 9 installation CD (or a copy of your Mac OS 9 System Folder) to
use Classic. Also, Macs sold after January 1, 2003 won’t be able to boot into
Mac OS 9, although they will still be able to run Mac OS 9 programs in Classic.
If your current hard disk has an OS 9 System Folder on it already, you’re
golden. If not, and you have access to a Mac with a Mac OS 9 System Folder
on it, you can copy that System Folder to a CD or DVD, and then copy it onto
your startup disk.
If you have an older Mac OS 9 installation CD (Version 9.0.x or 9.1.x) lying
around, you should be able to install that version and then use the OS 9
Software Update control panel to update it to 9.2.2. It’s worth trying if you
don’t have another way of getting an OS 9 System Folder on your Mac. And,
of course, you must have an OS 9 (9.2.2) System Folder on an attached hard
disk to use Classic.
Running under Mac OS X, Classic behaves like any other application, just like
AppleWorks, Internet Explorer, or TextEdit. With Classic running, you can use
Mac OS 9.2.2’s Apple menu (as long as at least one Classic program is running)
and you can run Mac OS 9 applications. 
You also have access (by switching to any OS X window) to your Mac OS X
Home, Desktop, and applications. Finally, you can switch to another program
(when a Classic program is active) by choosing it from the Application menu
at the far right of the Mac OS 9.2.2 (Classic) menu bar.
Most Macs sold after January 1, 2003 can’t start up in Mac OS 9. Which means
the only way to run older software on newer Macs is via Classic.
258
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

All currently open applications — including any Classic apps — appear in
your Dock for easy access.
What’s so great about Classic?
If you’re a Mac newbie or don’t have applications or other tools that work
with Mac OS 9, you may wonder why Apple would go to the trouble of includ-
ing Classic in Mac OS X and why you’d want to use it. Well, I think Classic
makes OS X a lot better by making available a panoply of older programs that
would otherwise be relegated to the slag heap. And long-time Mac users love
Classic because it provides access to programs that haven’t been updated for
Mac OS X. (The following section discusses this in much greater detail.)
Doin’ the Classic dance 
If you’re a former Mac OS 9 user, you probably have lots of applications and
documents that ran under Mac OS 9. For example, suppose that you have
Adobe’s Photoshop 6.5. You don’t have the Mac OS X-native version of
Photoshop (version 7, Photoshop CS, or Photoshop CS2) yet, but you do have
your copy of Photoshop 6.5, which worked perfectly with Mac OS 9. Classic
lets you use version 6.5 until you decide to upgrade to the OS X version of
Photoshop. Are you with me? Old software, old files, new operating system.
Although you certainly will want programs written for OS X (often called OS
X-native applications) rather than programs that run as Classic applications,
sometimes you have no choice: The program you want isn’t available as a
native OS X app — it either runs in Classic or not at all.
259
Chapter 12: The Classic Environment: Like Mac OS 9, Only Better
When emulation isn’t the sincerest form of flattery
Sometimes it’s the only way to go — and emula-
tors aren’t just for Mac OS 9/Classic. Some, like
Classic, do everything that an operating system
does except boot up the computer. Some bridge
the PC/Mac gap: With Pentium emulators (such
as Virtual PC) for Mac OS, for example, you run
Windows software on your Mac in a window
that looks like, well, Windows. Other kinds of
emulators — such as those used in companies
in which a Mac or PC needs to connect to a
mainframe or other big computer — run the
mainframe’s software in a window on your
desktop computer. Most emulators, including
Classic, enable you to use the keyboard short-
cuts and commands that the emulated system
(Mac OS 9, in the case of Classic) uses.

To make software work with Mac OS X, the folks who write it (developers)
have to rewrite (port) OS 9 programs for Mac OS X. Or they have to create
them from scratch by using special programming tools designed to create
native Mac OS X applications. Not all developers have done this yet — partly
because lots of people still use older Macs with older versions of Mac OS, and
because rewriting programs costs money and takes time.
But Apple has encouraged them, and they have responded. These days, there
are no new OS 9 (Classic) apps being released; 99.9 percent of software for
the Mac today is OS X-native.
Working with Classic
Frankly, there’s not much to working with Classic. If you launch an old pro-
gram, Classic launches itself and everything just works. But, in the inimitable
For Dummies tradition, I’m going to tell you all about it anyway. First I talk
about launching Classic, then I talk about opening Classic applications, then
I take a coffee break (kidding). Last but not least, I show you how to boot up
with OS 9.2.2 for those occasions where Classic just won’t do the job.
Launching Classic (or letting 
it launch itself)
You don’t really have to launch Classic, per se. It launches itself whenever
you open any Mac OS 9 application (or a document that belongs to that appli-
cation). When you do, your Mac figures out that the program or document is
a classic, and the Classic environment launches automatically.
That’s not exactly true. Although you can’t launch it in the traditional sense
(by opening its icon), you can make it launch from the Classic System
Preferences pane. In the upcoming “Setting Classic Preferences” section, I
show you how.
The first time that you launch Classic, a dialog appears, asking you to allow
Mac OS X to install some files in the Mac OS 9.2.2 System Folder (that’s the
folder that runs the Mac OS 9.2.2 environment). These files are needed to
bridge the gap between Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.2.2, so click OK when you
see the dialog.
After you launch Classic, you first see a small status window (shown in
Figure 12-1) with a progress bar and a Stop button . . . just in case you
change your mind and don’t want Classic to launch.
260
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

After you start Classic, you can watch the emulator load by clicking the 
right-pointing triangle below the progress bar (under the arrow cursor in
Figure 12-1). Clicking this triangle expands the window to show you the
progress of the startup process (as shown in Figure 12-2). If you’re a Mac OS 9
user, you’ll recognize the welcome screen.
If you don’t choose to view the startup process by expanding the Classic
window, just wait a bit and watch the progress bar inch its way along until
Mac OS 9.2.2 launches and is ready to use. At that point, the Classic window
disappears, your Classic application becomes active, and you see the Mac OS
9.2.2 menu bar. You can see it all in Figure 12-3; note the way the menu bar
changes to the old 9.2-style when Classic is active.

Chapter 12: The Classic Environment: Like Mac OS 9, Only Better

Opening a Classic app
With Classic, you can launch any pre-Mac OS X application by double-clicking
its icon. If Classic isn’t already running, double-clicking a Classic application
automatically launches both Classic and the application. When you double-
click a MacWrite (or other document) file associated with a Classic app, for
example, the Classic application launches — and so does MacWrite (or what-
ever Classic application created the file).
You can tell when you’re using a Classic program because when it’s active
(front-most on your screen), you see the old OS 9-style menu bar, complete
with a multi-colored Apple menu in the upper-left corner of your screen.
Figure 12-4 shows the old striped Apple menu and its blue OS X counterpart.
If you select the Graphite Appearance in the General System Preferences pane,
the OS X Apple icon will be gray instead of the default blue. In any event, it’s
always a solid color in the OS X menu bar — and always rainbow-colored in
the Classic menu bar.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Getting oriented (“Toto, we’re 
not in OS X, anymore . . .”)
Classic is a strange bird, combining things that are familiar from each of the
two operating systems on your Mac. In the following sections, I walk you
through what to expect when Classic is active.
Menu bar
The menu bar that you see when working in a Classic application is the Mac
OS 9.2.2 version. You’ll know it by the multi-hued Apple logo in the top-left
corner. Compare that with the Mac OS X Apple, which is a solid color (either
blue or gray, depending on your choice in the General System Preference Pane).
The Mac OS 9.2.2 menu bar appears when you have a Mac OS 9 application
open and active. If Classic has been launched but no Classic application is
running, you’ll see the Mac OS X menu bar.
Okay, space is limited here (and I can’t find my giant shoehorn), so instead
of going over all the features you can access from the Classic menu bar, I
point out just a few — and encourage you to explore them on your own.
Although most of the menus on the menu bar belong to the Classic applica-
tion that’s open (iCalc in Figure 12-3), a couple — sometimes more — are
part of Mac OS 9.2.2.
The first feature of the Mac OS 9.2.2 menu bar is the Apple menu (topped
by that rainbow Apple logo, as shown in Figure 12-4). The old customizable
Apple menu is among the coolest of all Mac OS 9 features — and one that lots
of Mac OS X users miss. This menu contains all sorts of goodies — such as
tools for working with parts of Mac OS 9 (control panels, the calculator, and
so forth), as well as aliases to folders (or files, if you’ve put them there). The
beauty of the Apple menu is that it’s available in all Classic Mac applications.
Figure 12-4:

Apple menu

263
Chapter 12: The Classic Environment: Like Mac OS 9, Only Better

Another menu I want to tell you about is the Application menu, located at the
top far-right corner of the OS 9.2.2 menu bar. You’ll know it by the applica-
tion’s name and icon — iCalc in Figure 12-5. The Application menu displays
a listing of all applications that are currently running, including both Classic
and Mac OS X applications.
Dock and icons
As in Mac OS X, the Finder’s Desktop and windows are visible when you’re
working in the Classic environment — that includes the Dock and any icons
you have on the Desktop. The Dock is pretty smart about Classic: When you
open a Classic application, the application’s icon appears on the Dock; the
icon disappears when you quit the application. In Figure 12-6, you can see
the Dock with one Classic application icon in the middle of some Mac OS X
application icons. Telling them apart is tricky — the Classic application
icons are, well, sometimes a little uglier than the Mac OS X ones. Where 
OS X icons have clean lines, OS 9 icons can look jaggy and . . . well . . . ugly.
(That’s because they’re old, lower-resolution icons.) Check out Figure 12-6
to see for yourself.
Finder windows
Whether a Classic application or the Mac OS X Finder is active, you might see
Mac OS X Finder windows (assuming that any are open and that your Classic
application isn’t blocking your view of them). You can use them to open or
move files as you normally would with Mac OS X alone. If you double-click a
file that belongs to a Mac OS 9 application, that program opens when you
launch the Classic application.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Getting back to OS X
To get out of Classic and back to OS X, just click the Desktop, any OS X icon
in the Dock, any OS X application in the Application menu, or any Finder
window, and you’re back to good ol’ Mac OS X as quick as a bunny.
To quit the Classic application, you’ll need to use the Classic System
Preference Pane as described in the next section.
Setting Classic preferences
In Chapter 13, I talk about System Preferences panes, but because the prefer-
ences for Classic are important to this discussion, I cover them here and now.
If you have multiple hard drives or partitions with Mac OS 9.2.2 installed on
them, you can choose which one to use as the operating system for the Classic
environment. You make that choice in the Classic pane of System Preferences.
(See Chapter 13 for more on System Preferences.) Just select the drive or par-
tition (mine is TigerDisk in Figure 12-7), and the next time that you launch
Classic, it uses that volume’s copy of Mac OS 9.2.2. Volumes that don’t include
Mac OS 9.2.2 appear dimmed in the Preferences window.
By selecting the Start Classic When You Log In check box, you tell Mac OS X
to do just that. The advantage is that you won’t have to wait a minute or two
for Classic to launch the first time you launch a Classic application. The dis-
advantage here is that Classic uses a hefty amount of RAM and other system
resources.

Chapter 12: The Classic Environment: Like Mac OS 9, Only Better

If you select the Warn Before Starting Classic check box, when you open a
Classic application or a document owned by a Classic application, OS X will
present a dialog warning you that Classic is about to start up and offers the
choice of starting or not starting it, as shown in Figure 12-8.
The third check box — Show Classic Status in Menu Bar — adds a useful
Classic status indicator and menu to the right side of your menu bar, as
shown in Figure 12-9.
Running Classic when you don’t need it can slow OS X’s performance, so I
prefer to keep Start Classic When You Log In disabled — and Warn Before
Starting Classic enabled. Classic then only runs when I’m sure I want and
need it — and never when I don’t.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Note the three buttons at the bottom of the System Preferences Classic pane’s
Start/Stop tab. (The last two are used mostly when the Classic environment
crashes, freezes, or otherwise acts improperly.)
 Stop/Start: Launches Classic without first launching a Classic program.
(If Classic is not running, this button toggles to Start.)
In the earlier section “Launching Classic (or letting it launch itself),” I
offer this tip: Although you can’t launch it (Classic) in the traditional sense
(by opening its icon), you can make it launch by using the Classic System
Preferences pane. The Start/Stop button is what I was talking about.
 Restart: Restarts Classic (big surprise), which is like rebooting OS 9.2.2
without having to reboot OS X.
You can continue to work in OS X — listen to iTunes, edit movies in iMovie,
surf the Web, get your mail, and so on — while Classic starts or restarts.
Which is just another reason OS X is better.
 Force Quit: Forces the Classic environment to quit, even if it’s crashed
or frozen.
Getting more info on Classic
To get the most from Classic, take a look at the version of this book that was
written especially for Mac OS 9: Mac OS 9 For Dummies (well, duh!). I’m very
proud of it. Read the chapters on the Apple menu and those that cover the
contents of the System Folder. You’ll discover a lot more about the wonders
available to you in the Classic environment.
Booting from Mac OS 9.2.2
Before I finish with Classic, here’s one more thing you may want to know —
how to boot your Mac so it runs OS 9.2.2 instead of OS X.
Figure 12-9:

Chapter 12: The Classic Environment: Like Mac OS 9, Only Better

As I mention earlier in the chapter, if you bought a Mac after January 1, 2003,
it may not be capable of booting OS 9 at all. If that’s the case, Classic is the
only way you can run OS 9 software.
And as I mention earlier in the chapter, some programs — mostly games —
just won’t work when you try to run them in the Classic environment under
OS X. When that happens, you’ll have to start up your Mac with OS 9.2.2 if
you want to use that program.
No problem; it’s a snap. Here’s how:
1. Open System Preferences by clicking its icon in the Dock or choosing
System Preferences from the Ú menu.
2. Click the Startup Disk icon to open the Startup Disk pane.
3. Click a Mac OS 9.2.2 icon to select it, as shown in Figure 12-10.
If you’ve installed OS 9.2.2 on two or more volumes, you’ll see two or
more OS 9 System Folders; select the one you want to boot from.
You can restart most Macs in Target Disk mode by holding down the T
key during startup. When your Mac is in Target Disk mode, it acts like a
FireWire hard drive — and can be connected to another computer via a
FireWire cable for fast file transfers. What’s new is that Mac OS X 10.4
has a button in the Startup Disk Preference pane that lets you restart
in Target Disk mode. I guess it’s there in case you forget the keyboard
shortcut (holding down the T key during startup). 
Figure 12-10:
Choose Mac
OS 9.2.2 to
start up your
Mac (while
running
Mac OS X).
268
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

4. Restart your Mac by choosing Restart from the Ú menu or by clicking
the Restart button.
That’s all there is to it. When your Mac comes back to life, you’ll be run-
ning Mac OS 9.2.2.
If you have both OS 9.2.2 and OS X on the same volume or disk, be careful not
to rename any of OS X’s folders or throw any of OS X’s folders in the Trash
while you’re running OS 9.2.2. The results could be catastrophic — you could
easily render OS X inoperable.
When your Mac runs OS 9.2.2 and you want to run OS X again, you can’t open
the Startup Disk System Preferences pane because it’s part of Mac OS X and it
isn’t available while running OS 9.2.2. Now what? Again, no problem. You do it
the old-fashioned way — by using the Startup Disk control panel; just follow
these steps:
1. Open the Startup Disk control panel by choosing Control
Panels➪Startup Disk from the Ú menu.
2. Click the folder representing Mac OS X, as shown in Figure 12-11.
3. Click the Restart button in the Startup Disk window.
That’s it. In a few moments, you’ll be up and running in Mac OS X.

E
veryone works a bit differently, and we all like to use our Macs in a cer-
tain way. System Preferences is the place in Mac OS X where you can set
options that are just right for you. You can set everything from the appear-
ance of your screen to the kind of network or Internet connection that you
have — and a whole lot more. In this chapter, I take you on a tour of all the
Mac OS X System Preferences panes. Hang on; it’s gonna be a long, but infor-
mative, ride — and you’ll end up with a Mac that works the way you want 
it to.
Introducing System Preferences
You find System Preferences on the Apple (Ú) menu and in the Dock. Choose
System Preferences from the Ú menu or click it in the Dock to get a look at all
the options that I discuss in this chapter. Check out all the features you can
change from the System Preferences window, as shown in Figure 13-1.
What you see in Figure 13-1 is the System Preferences window. But when you
click any of the icons here, the bottom part of the window changes to reflect
the options for the icon that you click. When this happens, I call the bottom
part of the window a pane. So, for example, when you click the Date & Time
icon in the System Preferences window, the bottom part of the window
becomes the Date & Time System Preference pane.

System Preferences are similar to those of the OS 9 (or — gasp — Windows)
Control Panels, but OS 9 Control Panels (for the most part) load at start up,
displaying an icon on the screen when they loaded. System Preference panes
don’t load at startup; they’re just there.
Just where? The actual files for Preference Panes are stored in the Preference
Panes folder, in the Library folder in the System folder. (Note: This is the 
OS X System folder, small f, not the OS 9 System Folder-with-a-capital-F.) If
you choose to install third-party preference panes, they can go either in the
Preference Panes folder in the Library folder at the top level of your startup
disk (if you want them to be available to all users) or in the Preference Panes
folder in the Library in your Home folder (if you want to keep them to 
yourself).
Some System Preferences relate to topics I cover in other chapters. I’ll let you
know any time I skip a preference that you can read about in another chapter.
In all previous versions of OS X, the System Preferences window had a cus-
tomizable toolbar, and I ranted about Apple’s choices in the default popula-
tion of said toolbar. Maybe they got tired of that rant, because they totally
eliminated the System Preferences toolbar in Tiger. Cool beans.
Using System Preferences
Before I examine the items in the System Preferences window, I need to
explain a couple of things about using them. This info applies to all System
Preferences, so listen up.
Figure 13-1:
The System
Preferences
window:
Change
your world.
272
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

To use a System Preference, just click it once to open its pane. You can
double-click if that habit is ingrained in your mouse finger, but there’s no
need.
Okay, so you’ve finished working with a System Preferences pane, but you
want to open another one. You could simply close the one that you’ve been
working on, or you could cut to the chase by clicking the Show All button,
located at the far left of the top row of icons on the System Preferences
window (as shown in Figure 13-1). Clicking the Show All button returns the
icons for all available System Preferences to view on the screen. You can 
also press Ô+L as a Show All Preferences keyboard shortcut.
Here’s an even more convenient way: Choose the System Preferences that
you want from the View menu. All the icons that you see in Figure 13-1 also
have an entry on this menu; choose one, and its System Preference pane
appears immediately.
Here’s another nifty tip: You can get rid of the categories altogether and 
display the icons in alphabetical order. As a bonus, it makes the System
Preferences window roughly 25 percent smaller on-screen.
When you choose View➪Organize Alphabetically, the categories disappear,
the window shrinks, and the icons are alphabetized, as shown in Figure 13-2.
To switch from alphabetical view back to category view, choose
View➪Organize by Categories.

Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Unlocking a preference
Many System Preferences have to be unlocked before you can use them.
That’s because some of these settings are applicable for all users — so they
require an Administrator password. After all, you can’t have just any user of
your Mac change the Network configuration and break it for everyone. See
Figure 13-3 to see what a locked preference looks like. Notice the locked lock
icon in the lower-left corner and that everything is grayed out and unavail-
able. Now compare that with Figure 13-4, where the lock has been unlocked
(by supplying an administrator user name and password) and all items are
enabled.
You don’t have to unlock all System Preferences to change them, just some of
them. When I come to a System Preference that must be unlocked before you
can use it, I’ll let you know up front. Deal? Good.
Only users with Administrator privileges can unlock some System Preferences.
(See Chapter 14 for more info on administrators and permissions.)
Figure 13-3:
A locked
System
Preferences
pane.
274
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

To unlock a preference, do the following:
1. Click the lock icon in the lower-left corner of the System Preferences
pane (also shown in the margin).
Mac OS X responds with an Authenticate dialog in which you enter your
user name and password.
The user name and password that you use here must be a user with
administrator privileges on this Mac. If your user account isn’t set up with
administrator privileges, you can’t unlock locked panes or change them.
You’ll need to supply an administrator’s user name and password — or
learn to live with it the way it is.
The first user that you create with OS X (when you first install it) is
always an administrator.
2. Enter this user information and then click OK.
Mac OS X unlocks the System Preference that you’re working with.
In Figure 13-4, you see the Sharing System Preferences pane after being
unlocked. Notice that you can now make changes to it; before it was
unlocked, all its options were grayed out and impossible to change.

Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Locking a preference
To relock a System Preferences pane (after you unlock it), simply click the
lock icon again. The pane locks itself instantly.
Setting Preferences
Ready to dig into each of the System Preferences? Great. I start with the first
category (Personal, as shown in Figure 13-1) and work from left to right
across the screen.
Personal preferences
The following preference panes are displayed in the Personal category.
Appearance
In the Appearance pane, you can choose specific aspects of how your Mac
looks and feels (see Figure 13-5).
Figure 13-5:
The
Appearance
System
Preferences
pane.
276
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Appearance options
Computers don’t care about appearances, but if you want your Mac to look a
bit more festive (or, for that matter, businesslike), you can use these menus:
 Appearance pop-up menu: Use choices from this menu to choose from
different appearances, changing the overall look of buttons and window
controls (the jellybeans in the scroll bars).
Apple, however, in its infinite wisdom, provides only two choices — Blue
and Graphite.
 Highlight Color pop-up menu: From here, you can choose the color that
text becomes surrounded by when you select it in a document or in an
icon’s name in a Finder window. This time Apple isn’t so restrictive. You
have seven highlight colors to choose from, plus Other, which brings up
a color picker from which you can choose almost any color.
Scroll bar behavior
The Place Scroll Arrows radio buttons let you choose whether you have the
traditional single arrow at either end or the default (introduced in OS 8) of
both arrows together at the bottom or to the right of the scroll bars.
Select from two radio buttons next to the Click in the Scroll Bar To heading to
move your view of a window either up or down by a page (the default behav-
ior for OS 9) or to the position in the document roughly proportionate to
where you clicked in the scroll bar.
Select the Jump to Here radio button if you often work with long (multi-page)
documents. You’ll find it quite handy for navigating long documents. And
don’t forget — the Page Down key on your keyboard does the same thing as
selecting the Jump to the Next Page choice, so you’ll lose nothing by select-
ing Jump to Here.
Using smooth scrolling makes documents more legible while you scroll. Give
it a try; if you think it’s making things feel sluggish, turn it off.
Minimize When Double-Clicking a Window Title Bar does just what it says —
it shrinks a window to the Dock when you double-click its title bar. And yes,
the yellow gumdrop button does the exact same thing.
The Number of Recent Items pop-up menus control how many applications,
documents, and servers are remembered in your Ú➪Recent Items submenu.
The Font Smoothing Style pop-up menu offers four settings for anti-aliasing
(smoothing) fonts on screen. The categories are
 Standard – Best for CRT: You know, your standard, clunky tube-type
monitor. If your monitor isn’t a flat-panel LCD, this is probably your 
best bet.
277
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

 Light: Just a hint of the essence of smoothing for your text.
 Medium – Best for Flat-Panel: For those sleek, flat-panel monitors and
notebooks, too.
 Strong: Mondo-smoothing. I happen to like it on my flat-panel display,
but you might not.
Ignore Apple’s editorial comments and try all four. Then choose the one that
looks best to your eyes.
The Turn off Text Smoothing for Font Sizes x and Smaller pop-up menu
(where x is the pop-up menu setting) does just what it says. Fonts that size
and smaller are no longer anti-aliased (smoothed) when displayed.
Dashboard & Exposé
Exposé is a cool feature, introduced with Panther (OS X 10.3). Dashboard 
is Tiger’s glitzy interface to the widgets I mention in Chapter 11 when dis-
cussing the Applications folder.
Exposé shows you all open windows (or all the windows open in the applica-
tion you’re currently using) by rearranging the windows on-screen and “gray-
ing out” everything else. It can also hide all windows so you can see your
desktop (what a concept). Both features can be controlled via keyboard or
mouse, and this preference pane (Figure 13-6) is where you tell Tiger how 
you want to access Dashboard and Exposé.
Figure 13-6:
The Dash-
board &
Exposé
preference
pane.
278
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

By default, you use the function keys to choose the way Exposé displays your
windows:
 To see all open windows, press F9.
 To see all open windows belonging to the current application, press F10.
 To hide all open windows and display the desktop, press F11.
 To summon forth the Dashboard, press F12.
A picture is worth a thousand words, so take a gander at Figure 13-7, where
I’ve got several applications running with multiple windows open in each of
them.
While using Exposé, if you point to a window but don’t click, the window’s
title appears. If you click any window — even one that’s grayed out — at any
time, Exposé deactivates and that window becomes active.
The four Active Screen Corners pop-up menus allow you to configure the cor-
ners of your screen to activate and deactivate Exposé and Dashboard features.
The four Keyboard pop-up menus let you change the keys Exposé and
Dashboard use from F9, 10, 11, and 12, or disable the keyboard commands
completely (by choosing the dash in any of the pop-up menus).

279
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

The four Mouse pop-up menus let you assign alternate mouse buttons to acti-
vate or deactivate Exposé and Dashboard features, for those of us who use
multibutton mice.
Desktop & Screen Saver
The Desktop & Screen Saver pane lets you set your Desktop color or picture,
as well as choose a screen saver for your Mac.
Desktop
Click the Desktop tab to specify a desktop picture or pattern. Apple provides a
number of collections; you choose one via the Collection pop-up menu, or you
can choose a different folder of images if you want. You can also drag an image
file into the well (that indented box in the upper-left corner of the pane).
When you choose a picture, from your Pictures folder or elsewhere, a pop-up
menu appears to the right of the well, allowing you to specify how you want
the picture displayed. You can
 Tile multiple copies of the image to fill the screen.
 Fill Screen enlarges the image, if necessary, until it fills the screen (this
might result in some clipping if the image and your screen don’t have
the same proportions).
 Stretch to fill screen keeps everything in view, but will distort the image
if the image and screen don’t have the same proportions.
 Center just places the image in the center of the screen and, if it is
smaller than the screen, provides it with a surrounding color that you
specify from the Color Picker.
When you select a folder of images, you can tell Tiger to change the desktop
picture at predefined intervals (Change Picture Every xx check box and pop-
up menu). You can even click the Random order check box so you won’t
always get the pictures in the same order.
Screen Saver
Click the Screen Saver tab to choose a screen-saver module.
Mac OS X comes with several screen-saver modules. To see what the selected
module looks like in action, click the Test button. Press any key to end the
test.
To set up the screen saver, first choose a screen saver from the list on the 
left side of the pane. Next, drag the Start Screen Saver slider to the number 
of minutes you want the Mac to wait before activating the screen saver.
280
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Click the Use Random Screen Saver check box to have your Mac choose a
new screen saver at random each time the screen saver kicks in.
You can require a password to wake your Mac from sleep or a screen saver.
This option appears in the Security System Preference pane as a check box:
Require a Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver. 
Finally, click the Hot Corners button to choose which corner(s) of your
screen activates the screen saver and which deactivates it. Now when you
move your mouse to a selected corner, you activate or deactivate the screen
saver.
That’s it. You’re done!
If you like Screen Savers/Effects, find plenty more available at your favorite
downloadable software repository (mine’s www.versiontracker.com).
Many are free, and some cost a few bucks. Some of those, like Marine
Aquarium in Figure 13-8 (from www.order-n-dev.com), are even worth
paying for.
I paid my $21.95, and it was worth every penny. It’s so lifelike, I sometimes
believe those are real fish in my monitor. Plus, unlike other fish I’ve owned,
these never float belly-up (or explode from overfeeding). I love this
saver/effect; it’s the only one I use anymore.

Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Dock
I cover the Dock and its preferences in great detail in Chapter 2. Rather than
waste any more trees, I’ll just move along to . . . .
International
If you’re in the U.S., you might assume that you don’t need to set anything in
the International System Preferences pane. After all, you chose to see your
Mac’s menus and commands in U.S. English when you first installed Mac OS
X, right? But wait — the International System Preferences pane has more in it
than just a choice of language. Here’s where you can set date and time for-
mats — probably the most useful feature for U.S. folks — and yes, you can
choose a new language here, too.
The International System Preferences pane has three tabs: Language,
Formats, and Input Menu. I describe each in the following sections.
Language
This is where you set your Mac’s order of preference for languages used in
applications. Choose the languages you want your Mac to use by clicking 
the Edit button and checking or unchecking check boxes; to organize your
choices, drag an entry up or down in the list on the left. If an application 
uses the first language you indicate in this list, you see the application’s 
commands and menus in that chosen language. If your first language choice
isn’t available, the next option is used, and so on.
The Order of Sorted Lists pop-up menu lets you select a language whose sort-
ing order will be used for lists.
The Word Break pop-up menu is where you specify the language whose rules
determine where words begin and end so your software knows (for example)
where to wrap a line of text.
Formats
First choose your present location from the Region pop-up menu. Then you
select a format for the way dates, times, and numbers are displayed by click-
ing appropriate Customize button. A sheet appears, showing all the options
available. Make your choices and click OK.
When specifying a date format, you can also choose which calendar system
to employ. Some of the supplied calendars include Gregorian (the one we
think of as standard in the U.S.), Hebrew, Japanese, and Islamic.
282
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Note that when you change an option in any of these sheets, the way it will
look if you click OK appears in a gray rectangle near the bottom of the sheet.
In the Numbers section, you’ll also see a drop-down list for specifying the
currency units you wish to employ by default, and it is quite a list. You can
easily find some crossword puzzle answers in this collection. Additionally,
there is a pop-up menu where you specify your preferred units of measure-
ment: U.S. and Metric are the choices. (What’s called U.S. used to be called
“English,” but the U.S. is the last holdout from the worldwide conversion to
the metric system.)
Input Menu
Use the Input Menu tab to select keyboard layouts, input methods, and
palettes that appear in the input menu, which you can display in the menu
bar by clicking the Show Input Menu in Menu Bar check box, as shown in
Figure 13-9.
While many users will never need an alternative keyboard layout, two of the
palettes — the Character and Keyboard Viewer — can be quite handy, as
shown in Figure 13-10.
Figure 13-9:
The Input
Menu tab 
in the
International
pane (left)
and the

283
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Do not under any circumstances click the Options button on the Input Menu
tab unless you have good reason to use foreign keyboard layouts on occasion.
The Ô+Option+spacebar keyboard shortcut, when turned on, can cause unpre-
dictable behavior if (later on) you forget that you turned it on. Use this thingy
with caution — especially if you use Photoshop (which uses Ô+Option+
spacebar as the shortcut for Zoom Out).
Security
At the top of the pane, you see the FileVault section. I really can’t explain
what FileVault does any more clearly than the expository text. If Apple
explained all their features as well as they do FileVault, I’d probably have to
look for other work — but they don’t (as can be seen even in the bottom half
of this pane).
In addition to FileVault, this pane offers five check box items that deal with
your Mac’s security:
 Require Password to Wake This Computer from Sleep or Screen Saver:
This item causes your Mac to require a password to wake it from sleep
or to dismiss the screen saver.
Turning this preference on won’t prevent another user from turning off
the computer, restarting it, and then logging into their account. If you
think this sort of thing could happen, be sure to save your work before
you leave your computer.
 Disable Automatic Login: This item causes your Mac to require every
user to provide a user name and password each time the Mac is started
up or restarted.

Palette

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

If you want your Mac to start up to the Finder without first asking for a
user name or password, select the Automatically Log In option in the
Accounts preference pane — and (of course) keep this item unchecked.
 Require Password to Unlock Each Secure System Preference: This
item locks all the System Preference panes that affect all users so they
cannot be changed without an administrator name and password.
 Log Out After __ Minutes of Inactivity: This item causes your Mac to log
out automatically after a set number of minutes pass without any key-
board or mouse activity.
 Use Secure Virtual Memory: This item encrypts your virtual-memory
storage and decrypts the data when it’s paged back into RAM.
Spotlight
This preference pane is your control center for the incredibly slick (and 
fast) searching technology that Apple has given the name Spotlight. Using
Spotlight, you can find anything on your Mac virtually instantaneously. 
Yep, this is a new feature. Because Apple has provided hooks to Spotlight,
applications also have access to the fast searching, as Apple shows off in the
Tiger versions of Mail, Address, iCal, and other applications. You can even
use Spotlight searches in Open dialogs and Save sheets.
The Spotlight pane’s two tabs (Figure 13-11) let you control which categories
are displayed and in what order (Search Results) and locations that aren’t to
be searched (Privacy).

Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Hardware preferences
Here’s where you teach your Mac to play nice with all the gadgets connected
to it. The following preference panes are displayed in the Hardware category.
CDs & DVDs
Introduced with Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar, this preference pane lets you
decide what your Mac should do when you insert a blank or pre-recorded CD
or DVD. Choose here from five pop-up menus; you can also set your Mac to
launch certain applications, run AppleScripts, or nothing at all.
Displays
This pane has two tabs — Display and Color — to set various options for
your monitor.
Display
The Colors pop-up menu lets you choose the number of colors your monitor
displays. 
The list of resolutions governs how much stuff you see on your monitor. The
smaller the numbers, the less you’ll see and the bigger you’ll see it. Bigger
numbers mean you see more, but it’s smaller. Got it? Most monitors and
video cards support multiple resolutions, and some also allow you to choose
from multiple refresh rates.
Many monitors offer settings to adjust their brightness; some also enable you
to adjust their gamma settings in this tab. If your monitor supports these fea-
tures, you will see Brightness and/or Gamma Control slide bars in this tab. If
you have these features, adjust them the way that looks best to your eyes.
The Show Displays in Menu Bar check box gives you the little menu that you
see at the upper-right of most of the figures in this book, so you can change
the resolution and color depth without opening the System Preferences 
application.
If you have a laptop, you see a Detect Displays button; if you have a desktop
Mac, you won’t have that button. It does just what its name implies: When
you connect an external display to your laptop Mac, if that display isn’t rec-
ognized automatically (which it usually is), you can click this button (or
choose Detect Displays from the Displays menu), and the monitor will be
instantly recognized without restarting!
This OS X-only detail is good to remember if you use several different exter-
nal displays or projection systems in different locations. It saves you from
shutting down/restarting and makes the whole process a little sweeter. Just
click and you’re done.

Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Color
Choose a pre-configured profile for your monitor (for Apple-brand monitors)
and calibrate your display (any brand, including Apple). To calibrate, click
the Calibrate button; an assistant will walk you through the process.
Arrange
Finally, if you have two video cards or are using a PowerBook and external
monitor together, you’ll see a third tab called Arrange. Drag the little pictures
that represent your monitors to arrange your screens. Make the on-screen
arrangement match the physical set up of your monitors as closely as possi-
ble. If you want to place the menu bar on the other screen, drag the little pic-
ture of the menu bar from one little screen to the other.
The Arrange tab appears only on PowerBooks with an external display con-
nected to them, and on desktop Macs with either more than one graphics
card installed or more than one monitor connected to a graphics card (lots of
G4 and G5 desktop Macs contain video cards that can support two monitors
simultaneously).
Energy Saver
All Macs are Energy Star-compliant (and have been for years), allowing you to
preset your machine to turn itself off at a specific time or after a specified
idle period. It offers three tabs: Sleep, Schedule, and Options.
If you have a battery-powered Mac, you’ll also have a check box to enable or
disable the battery-status indicator in the menu bar.
Sleep
To enable Sleep mode, move the slider to the desired amount of time. You
can choose any number between 1 minute and 3 hours, or turn Sleep off
entirely by moving the slider all the way to the right to Never.
You can also set separate sleep times for your Mac’s display and choose
whether to let your hard disk go to sleep if it supports sleep mode. Setting
the display to sleep might come in handy if you want your Mac to keep doing
what it’s doing and you don’t need to use the monitor. The hard drive’s sleep
option is less useful unless you’ve got a PowerBook or an iBook. Checking
this option forces your hard drive to sleep after a few minutes of inactivity,
which saves you some battery power.
To activate display sleep, select the Put the Display to Sleep when Computer
is Inactive for check box and then drag the slider to the idle-time interval you
want.
287
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

To wake up your Mac from its sleep, merely move your mouse or press any
key on the keyboard.
Drag the slider to 30 or 45 minutes for sleep; remember to turn off your Mac
manually when you’re not going to need it for a day or more.
Schedule
To start up, shut down, or put your Mac to sleep at a predetermined time,
check the appropriate check box and choose the appropriate choices from
the Schedule tab’s pop-up menus.
Options
The Options tab is home to a small collection of useful settings. On this tab,
you’ll find check boxes telling the Mac to wake up automatically when the
modem detects an incoming call (useful for fax software), to automatically
wake for Ethernet network administrative access (handy in a corporate set-
ting where an IT person maintains system configurations), and to restart
automatically after a power failure.
PowerBook and iBook users get additional Energy Saver options — including
whether to display a battery-status indicator in the menu bar near the clock,
as well as a pop-up menu called Processor Performance that offers two
options: Highest and Reduced.
Choose Highest when AC power is connected and Reduced when you need to
conserve battery power.
Keyboard & Mouse
This pane lets you modify how your keyboard and mouse respond. It offers
three tabs (plus a fourth tab — Trackpad — for iBooks and PowerBooks):
Keyboard
Drag the Key Repeat Rate slider to set how fast a key repeats when you hold
it down. This feature comes into play when (for example) you hold down the
dash (-) key to make a line or the asterisk (*) key to make a divider.
Drag the Delay Until Repeat slider to set how long you have to hold down a
key before it starts repeating.
You can type in the box at the bottom of the window to test your settings
before exiting this tab.
The Show Eject in Menu Bar check box lets you add an Eject menu to your
menu bar, which can come in handy when you’ve got a recalcitrant disk that
doesn’t want to come out of your CD or DVD drive.
288
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Mouse
The Mouse tab is where you set your mouse speed and double-click delays.
Move the Tracking Speed slider to change the relationship between hand
movement of the mouse and cursor movement on the screen. A faster track-
ing speed setting (moving the slider to the right) sends your cursor squirting
across the screen with a mere flick of the wrist; slower mouse speed settings
(moving the slider to the left) make the cursor crawl across in seemingly
slow motion, even when your hand is flying. Set this setting as fast as you can
stand it — I like the fastest speed. Try it: You might like it.
The Double-Click Speed setting determines how close together two clicks
must be for the Mac to interpret them as a double-click and not as two sepa-
rate clicks. Move the slider arrow to the leftmost setting (Very Slow) for the
slowest. With this setting, you can double-click at an almost leisurely pace.
The rightmost position (Fast) is the fastest setting, which I prefer. The middle
area of the slider represents a double-click speed somewhere in the middle.
Changes in the Mouse System Preferences pane take place immediately, so
you should definitely play around a little and see what settings feel best for
you. You can test the effect of your changes to the Double-Click Speed setting
in the Double-Click Here to Test text box at the bottom of the window before
you close this preference pane.
Trackpad
If you have a portable Mac with a trackpad (the mouse that is not a mouse) —
such as a PowerBook or iBook — you’ll see an additional tab — Trackpad —
where you can set the tracking speed and double-clicking behavior of your
trackpad.
Note: If you have a PowerBook or iBook, there will also be a tab for trackpad
settings with the same two settings and options to specify just what tasks the
trackpad can be used for, such as tapping it rather than pressing the button
when you want to click something. You can even tell OS X to ignore the track-
pad while you’re typing. But all these goodies are only for notebook Macs —
the only kind that include trackpads.
Keyboard Shortcuts
The Keyboard Shortcuts tab was a new feature in Panther and a welcome one
at that. Tiger evolves Keyboard Shortcuts to something even better and
brighter. It lets you add, delete, or change keyboard shortcuts for many oper-
ating system functions such as taking a picture of the screen and using the
keyboard to choose menu and dock items. It also allows you to add, delete,
or change keyboard shortcuts for your applications.
To change a shortcut, double-click it and then hold down the new shortcut
keys. To add a new shortcut, click the + button; to delete a shortcut, click 
the – button.
289
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

The Turn on Full Keyboard Access check box lets you use the keyboard to
access all the controls in a window or dialog, which lets you use the Tab key
to select buttons and check boxes, allowing you to avoid using the mouse for
the most part, if that’s your preference.
When Full Keyboard Access is enabled, you press the key combination speci-
fied to use the Tab and arrow keys to move among items in the menu bar,
Dock, any window’s toolbar, or most palettes (floating windows). If you really
hate to use your mouse or if your mouse is broken, these keyboard shortcuts
can come in really handy. I tend to use them more on my PowerBook when
I’m traveling and don’t have room to hook up a mouse because I really don’t
like using the built-in mouse-thing (technically called a trackpad).
Print & Fax
This pane lets you configure printers and the built-in Fax capability. It offers
three tabs: Printing, Faxing, and Sharing. Also see Chapter 10, which is all
about printing.
Printing
Click the Printer Setup button to launch the Printer Setup Utility and config-
ure a new printer. 
The Selected Printer in Print Dialog pop-up menu lets you choose which
printer is selected by default in Print dialogs and sheets.
The Default Paper Size in Page Setup pop-up menu lets you choose the
default paper size your Mac will use in Page Setup dialogs and sheets.
Faxing
Click the Receive Faxes on This Computer check box to enable faxing. Type
your fax line’s phone number into the My Fax Number field. Set the number of
rings you want the software to wait before answering a fax call in the Answer
after __ Rings field. Click the Save To check box to enable a pop-up menu that
lets you select which folder incoming faxes will be saved to. Click the Email
To check box to send an email to yourself (or anyone) when a fax arrives.
Click the Print on Printer check box to print incoming faxes automatically
(which you choose from the pop-up menu next to the check box).
Sharing
The Share These Printers with Other Computers check box allows printers
connected to this Mac to be made available to other Macs on the local-area
network. When you activate this check box, the printers directly connected
to this Mac are listed in the list box — and you can select other check boxes
for the ones you want to share.
290
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Finally, the Let Others Send Faxes through This Computer check box allows
other Macs on the local-area network to send faxes through this Mac.
Sound
This pane controls the way your Mac plays and records sound — and offers
three tabs: Sound Effects, Output, and Input.
To make your Mac’s volume louder or softer, use the Output Volume slider at
the bottom of the window. Select the Mute check box to turn off all sound.
Click the Show Volume in Menu Bar check box to add a volume control menu
to your menu bar.
These three items appear at the bottom of the Sound pane no matter which
of the three tabs is active.
Sound Effects
Choose an alert (beep) sound by clicking its name; set its volume using the
Alert Volume slider control.
You can also specify the output device through which they play (if you have
more than one) by selecting from the Play Alerts and Sound Effects Through
pop-up menu.
The Play User Interface Sound Effects check box turns on sound effects for
actions such as dragging a file to the Trash.
The Play Feedback When Volume Keys Are Pressed check box tells your Mac
to beep once for each press of the increase or decrease volume keys (usually
the volume keys on a standard Apple extended keyboard, but the F4 and F5
keys on laptops and other keyboards).
A shortcut to the Sound System Preference pane is to press Option while
pressing any of the volume keys.
You can find new sounds on the Internet at your favorite shareware archive
(www.versiontracker.com and www.macupdate.com are the two that I like
best).
To install new sounds, move them into the Sounds folder inside the Library
folder at root level on your hard drive if you want them to be available to all
users of this Mac. Or put them in the Sounds folder inside the Library folder
in your home folder if you want to be the only one that can use them. (See
Chapter 6 for more info on these two Library folders.)
291
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Output
Use the Balance slider in the Output tab to make either stereo speaker louder
than the other.
Two that won’t show (unless . . .)
Two more preference panes might appear in the Hardware section, but only if
your Mac has the appropriate hardware connected to it.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is wireless networking for low-bandwidth peripherals introduced 
in Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar. If your Mac is equipped with a Bluetooth
adapter, you can synchronize wirelessly with phones and Palm devices, 
print wirelessly to Bluetooth printers, and who knows what else (it’s very
new technology).
Bluetooth is designed to work with iSync — Apple’s synchronization 
technology — to let you synchronize your address book, calendar, and book-
marks wirelessly with Bluetooth phones such as the Sony Ericsson T68i.
Ink
Ink is Mac OS X’s built-in handwriting recognition engine, also introduced in
Version 10.2 Jaguar. If you have a stylus and tablet connected to your Mac,
just turn it on in this pane and you can write anywhere you can type with the
keyboard.
The Ink pane is another one you’ll only see if you have one of the handful of
tablets that Ink supports connected to your Mac.
All currently supported tablets come from Wacom (www.wacom.com) with
prices starting under $100 for a small wireless stylus and tablet.
Internet & Network preferences
The following preference panes are displayed in the Internet & Network cat-
egory. Also see Chapter 9, which covers networking and the Internet.
.Mac
The .Mac pane lets you configure your .Mac subscription and iDisk (if you
have them). It offers four tabs:
 Account: If you have a .Mac account, you can type your name and pass-
word here so that you don’t have to type them every time that you use
your iDisk or Mail. (See Chapter 9’s section on .Mac if you want to know
what that’s all about.)
292
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Click the Sign Up button, and your Web browser will open and take you
to the Apple .Mac Sign Up page.
 Sync: The Sync tab is where you can specify which synchronization ser-
vices you wish to employ. You can use iSync to manage Safari book-
marks, iCal calendars, Address Book information, keychains, mail
accounts, and Mail rules, signatures, and smart mailboxes.
 iDisk: This tab shows how much of your iDisk (your remote disk main-
tained on Apple’s servers for .Mac members) is used, how much is avail-
able, and how you have allocated space between disk storage and mail
storage. It also allows you to keep a local copy of your iDisk on your
hard disk and synchronize it automatically or manually, and make your
Public Folder Read/Write or Read-Only with or without a password.
 Advanced: Use this pane to register several Macs for synchronization
through your .Mac account.
Network
This pane offers options for connecting your Mac to the Internet or to a net-
work. Although I talk a little about this pane in Chapter 9, here’s some fast-
and-dirty detail to give you the gist.
If you’re part of a large office network, check with your System Administrator
before you change anything in this pane. If you ignore this advice, you run
the risk of losing your network connection completely.
At the top of this pane is the Location pop-up menu. If you use your Mac in
more than one place, you can set up a separate configuration for each loca-
tion and then choose it from this menu. A location, in this context, consists 
of all settings in all tabs in the Network System Preferences pane. After you
have this entire pane configured the way that you like, pull down this menu
and choose New Location. Type in a name for the new location and then click
OK. Then you can change all the settings in this pane at once by choosing
that location from the pop-up menu.
If your Mac has a single network or Internet connection (as most home users
have), just choose Automatic from the Location menu and be done with it.
Below the Location menu is the Show pop-up menu. Here you choose your
network status, Internet connectivity method, and port configuration. If you
use a modem to connect to the Internet, choose Internal Modem. If you have
another type of Internet access, such as ISDN, cable modem, or Digital
Subscriber Line (DSL), choose either Ethernet or Built-in Ethernet.
Depending on which type of connection you choose in the Show menu, you’ll
see four or five tabs. You’ll need to talk to your ISP or network administrator
to find out how to configure them; I can’t tell you how in this book (there are
293
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

just too many configurations that depend on your particular ISP and service).
But here’s a brief rundown on the most important ones:
 TCP/IP: TCP/IP is the language of the Internet. On this tab, you specify
things such as your IP Address, Domain Name Servers, and Search
Domains.
 PPP or PPPoE: These acronyms stand for Point-To-Point Protocol and
Point-To-Point Protocol over Ethernet. Which one you see depends on
what you’ve selected from the Show menu. All modems use PPP; some
cable and DSL modems use PPPoE. Your ISP will tell you whether you
need to do anything with this tab.
 AppleTalk: AppleTalk is a homegrown network protocol invented by
Apple. Some (but not all) networked printers require it to be turned on
for them to function. For more information about AppleTalk in general,
this tab in particular, and printers, see Chapter 10.
 Proxies: If you’re on a large network or your Mac is behind a firewall,
you might need to specify one or more proxy servers. If so, your net-
work administrator can help you with this tab’s settings. If you’re a
home user, you’ll probably never need to touch this tab. Finally, some
ISPs require you to specify proxy servers; if you need to do this, ask
your ISP what to do.
QuickTime
QuickTime is Apple’s multimedia technology for both Mac and Windows.
When you watch a movie on your Mac (unless you’re watching a DVD, of
course), chances are good that it’s a QuickTime file.
Chances are also good that QuickTime is already configured properly. 
The QuickTime pane has five tabs: Register, Browser, Update, Streaming, and
Advanced. Just check to make sure that QuickTime is set as follows and then
leave this preference alone.
Register
This is where you go to upgrade your copy of QuickTime to QuickTime Pro
(for $30). If you have a QuickTime Pro key, you can enter the information here
and unlock the Pro features. If you don’t already have a key, you can click the
Buy QuickTime Pro button, which transports you to the Apple Store where
you can stick a copy in your shopping cart.
Browser 
This tab deals with the way your Internet browser handles multimedia files; it
contains three check boxes:
 Select the Play Movies Automatically check box if it’s not already
checked if you want your browser to play movies when it encounters
them.
294
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

 Select the Save Movies in Disk Cache check box to save QuickTime
movies in the browser’s cache folder (in your Home/Library/Preferences
folder; if you use Internet Explorer, they’re in Explorer/Temporary
Items.)
Don’t rely on this feature. Some movies don’t download at all when you
view them in your browser; others only download the first frame. If you
need to harvest QuickTime movies from the Web, you’ll be better off
buying the $30 QuickTime Pro upgrade, which, among other things, lets
you save QuickTime movies from within your browser.
 Select the Enable Kiosk Mode check box to hide the QuickTime con-
troller (Play/Pause/Volume/and so on) within your browser.
The Allow Multiple Simultaneous Streams check box lets you have more than
one QuickTime movie or file streaming into your Mac over the Internet (or
local-area network) at a time.
If streaming movies or sounds are stuttering or not playing properly, try
unchecking this option.
Update
Change settings in the Update tab to update your QuickTime software auto-
matically (if you have an Internet connection). Because each successive ver-
sion of QuickTime has added cool and useful features, I suggest you select
the Check for Updates Automatically check box. After you do, your Mac will
check for new versions of QuickTime whenever you connect to the Internet.
As Martha Stewart says, “It’s a good thing.”
Streaming
This tab is where you select the speed of your Internet connection by choos-
ing the appropriate option from the Streaming Speed pop-up menu. If you’re
not sure what your connection speed is, ask your ISP. (If you’re not sure what
an ISP is, I suggest you give Chapter 9 a read.)
The Enable Instant On check box lets you adjust how quickly streaming
movies and sounds start playing. Alas, turning this feature on may degrade
streaming-media performance. 
Advanced
I strongly suggest you ignore the Advanced tab. I have yet to need the fea-
tures on it even though they’ve been available in QuickTime for years. If you
want to use a music synthesizer (other than the built-in QuickTime Music
Synthesizer) or if someone sends you a secured media file (or you download
one), you’ll have to play with these settings — but I’ve never had to touch
either one.
295
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

The Transport Setup pop-up menu offers advanced options for receiving files
over the Internet. I suggest you leave this alone unless you’re instructed to
change it by someone highly knowledgeable, such as your ISP.
The MIME settings button at the bottom of this pane offers advanced options
for receiving files over the Internet. I suggest you leave this alone unless
you’re instructed to change it by someone highly knowledgeable, such as
your ISP.
Sharing
This is another option that you’ll use when networking your Mac. There are
two facets of Sharing — sharing a single Mac with other users and sharing files
via an office network or the Internet. Read all the gory details in Chapter 14.
System System preferences 
(kind of redundant)
This section examines the preference panes displayed in the System category
for administering your, um, system. (That still sounds weird.)
Accounts (formerly Users)
This pane, which is only fully useful to users with Administrator access, is
where you create and administer user accounts on your Mac. About the only
actions those non-Admin users can take in the Accounts pane are to
 Change their passwords
 Change their login pictures
 Specify applications to run and documents to open when they log in
I cover administering user accounts in greater detail in Chapter 14, but (true
to my promise) here I show you how to get rid of logging in entirely if you
don’t like it. Here’s what to do: If you don’t have any reason to worry about
someone else logging on and making mischief (or if you don’t share your
Mac), you can disable the login screen by clicking the Login Options button
beneath the list of accounts.
When you disable logging in, you also affect all the preferences set by anyone
else who shares your Mac. (Yikes.) So, if your Desktop pattern, keyboard set-
tings, and so forth are different from those of someone else who uses your
machine, those preferences won’t be properly reflected unless each of you
has a separate, individual login account. Even if you’re not worried about
security, consider keeping logging in enabled if any other users have
accounts on your machine.
296
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

To disable the logging-in requirement, you may first need to unlock the
Accounts System Preference. (For more on unlocking a preference, see the
“Using System Preferences” section earlier in this chapter.)
To disable login, select yourself in the list of users, click the Login Options
button below the list, check the Log In Automatically As check box, and then
choose your account from the pop-up menu.
Note that only one account is allowed to use auto-login. If another user 
wants to use this Mac, you need to choose Log Out from the Ú menu or press
Ô+Shift+Q or have Fast User Switching enabled. And if you’ve disabled auto-
matic login in the Security System Preference pane, you can’t enable it here.
For non-automatic logins, the Login Options pane has additional choices. You
can choose to have your login window display just two fields — user name
and password — or show the flashier list of users of this Mac, complete with
those cute little pictures.
The Show Restart, Sleep, and Shut Down buttons and Show Password Hint
check boxes do just what their names imply.
The Show Input Menu in Login Window check box is handy if you’re using
non-Roman input methods, such as Japanese or Chinese. The Use VoiceOver
at Login check box turns on the new VoiceOver functionality (described later
in this chapter) at login.
One cool feature you’ll find in Login Options is the Enable Fast User Switching
check box. It lets you switch your Mac from one user to another without first
logging out. Just choose the account you want to switch to from the Fast User
Switching menu (which appears when this option is enabled, as shown in
Figure 13-12).
Figure 13-12:
Fast User
Switching is
much faster
than logging

account.
297
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Classic
Open the Classic System Preferences pane to choose the drive or drive parti-
tion that contains a Mac OS 9.2.2 System Folder to use when working in the
Classic environment. I dig deep into the Classic environment in Chapter 12.
Suffice to say that if you have Mac OS 9 applications (or if you’re nostalgic for
the way things were in Mac OS 9), you need to use the Classic System
Preferences pane.
Having multiple Mac OS operating systems isn’t quite as bewildering as
having multiple personalities, but I’ll repeat what I said in Chapter 12 about
version numbers to minimize confusion:
Mac OS X (10.3) requires version 9.2.2 of Mac OS, commonly referred to as
Mac OS 9.2.2, to provide the Classic environment. But most (if not all) pro-
grams don’t distinguish between different versions of Mac OS 9. So when I
call a program a Mac OS 9 program, what I mean is that it’s not an OS X pro-
gram and that it will run under any version of Mac OS 9. In other words, when
I talk about stuff that works with (or appears in) all versions of Mac OS 9, I
say Mac OS 9. When I’m talking about Classic or another feature or program
that requires OS 9.2.2, I say Mac OS 9.2.2.
Date & Time
Within the Date & Time System Preferences pane, you can configure your
Mac’s internal clock (which many programs use) and the clock that you see
in the menu bar. Three tabs appear: Date & Time, Time Zone, and Clock.
Date & Time
To change the date, click a day in the current month’s calendar (or click the
date field above the calendar and use the up- and down-arrows that appear to
the right of this field). 
To set the time, type in the correct values in the Current Time field that
appears above the clock face, or click the number that you want to change
and use the up- and down-arrows that appear to the right of this field.
You can also use the arrow keys on the keyboard to increase or decrease the
number. Or you can type a new number right over the selected number.
When you have the time set the way you want it, click the Save button. Or, if
you mess up, click the Revert button to return to the way it was before you
began.
Use the Tab key to move from number to number. The settings for the hour,
minute, and second are selected in sequence when you press the Tab key. If
you want to move backward through the sequence, press Shift+Tab. As long
as you hold the Shift key down, you cycle through the numbers in reverse
order when you press Tab.
298
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

You won’t be able to set the date or time if you’ve already checked the Set
Date & Time Automatically check box. 
Network time servers are very cool, enabling you to synchronize your Mac’s
clock to a super-accurate time server on the Internet. To use a time server,
however, you must be connected to the Internet when your Mac checks the
time.
To set up access to a time server, just click the Set Date & Time Automatically
check box, and then choose a network time server from the pop-up menu.
Apple’s Network Time Server is time.apple.com. You’re allowed to use it, of
course.
If you have trouble with the network time-server feature, Apple posts a tech-
nical note that lists dozens of alternative network time servers. You can find
this tech note (and several other tech notes you may find useful) by going to
the Apple Knowledge Base (http://kbase.info.apple.com) and searching
for network time server.
Time Zone
This tab lets you set your machine according to what time zone you’re in.
Click your part of the world on the map that appears or choose a time zone
from the pop-up menu. The map is updated to show your time zone when 
you do.
Clock
This tab controls the display of the clock in the right corner of your menu
bar. Each of the seven options in this tab has a check box to turn it on or off.
Those options are as follows:
 The Show the Date and Time in the Menu Bar or in a Window radio but-
tons let you choose to see a clock on the right side of the menu bar or in
a floating window.
 The View As radio buttons let you choose to see your clock (in the menu
bar or window) as an analog or digital version. (If you choose analog,
the next four options in this list aren’t available.)
 The Display the Time with Seconds check box determines whether the
time is displayed with seconds (04:20:45 ).
 The Show AM/PM check box determines whether you see AM or PM
after the time (4:20 PM ).
 The Show the Day of the Week check box determines whether the day is
included before the time (Monday 4:20 PM). If this check box is not
marked, all you see is the time (4:20 PM).
299
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

 The Flash the Time Separators check box determines whether the sepa-
rating colons (:) between the hours and minutes (and seconds if you
select the Display the Time with Seconds check box) blink on and off. If
you deselect this check box, you still see the colons but they don’t blink.
 The Use a 24-Hour Clock check box does what it says. If you’re military,
travel a lot, or have lived abroad, you may prefer the 24-hour clock
(which expresses 1:00 p.m. as 1300 hours and so on). If so, mark this
check box.
You can also have your Mac play town crier and announce the time at preset
intervals (quarter hour, half hour, or hour).
Software Update
Occasionally, Apple releases a new version of some of the software that’s part
of a Mac system. Such releases may be a patch for the system software, a bug
fix for a utility program, or even a new version of Safari, iTunes, iCal, or any
other Apple-labeled software. You can set Software Update to check for new
software, as well as to notify you of changes and download the fresh, hot files
to your Mac. (Note: You must have an Internet connection to use this fea-
ture.) Software Update has two tabs:
Update Software: Use this tab to choose to update your software auto-
matically by marking the check box on the Update Software tab in this
preference pane. If you do, you can choose how often your Mac checks
for updates from the pop-up menu. If you select the Check for Updates
check box, you can also select the Download Important Updates in the
Background check box. Checking this latter check box just downloads
the Installer file for the update, but doesn’t install it until you give
Software Update the go-ahead. Bottom line: You don’t have to wait while
a 30MB (or whatever) update downloads after you decide you want to
install it.
Click the Check Now button at the bottom of the window to check manu-
ally for updates any time you like, even if you’ve selected the
Automatically radio button.
Installed Updates: This tab shows which updates, if any, you’ve already
installed. Click the Open as Log File button, and the installed update log
will open in the Console application for you to review or save.
Speech
This pane lets you configure your desired Speech settings. It offers two tabs,
which I discuss following.
300
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Speech Recognition 
This is where you set up speech recognition — the capability to talk to your
Mac and have it understand you. Alas, I’m going to have to use another
weasel-out here — I just don’t have a chapter’s worth of space left to explain
all the other Speech goodies. Sigh. Well, okay, here are a few more tips, hints,
and rants.
You’ll need a decent microphone to use this feature. Unfortunately, Macs
don’t come with one, and (in my experience) the mike that’s built into iMacs
and some notebooks aren’t quite good enough. Even worse, many Mac
models, including some PowerBooks, don’t even have an audio-in port, so
you have to use a microphone that connects via your Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port. Luckily, USB microphones — and converters for connecting stan-
dard microphone connectors to USB — are fairly common these days.
Dr. Bott is a great little Mac-only company that specializes in little items 
like USB microphones and analog-to-USB converters. Its Web address is www.
drbott.com, or you can call 877-611-2688. Eric Prentice is the CEO; tell him
that Bob sent you.
You can’t use this feature to dictate text to your Mac — you’ll need Mac-
Speech’s iListen, or similar software to do that. But you can use it to launch
programs (“Computer, open Microsoft Word”) and other stuff, like emptying
the Trash, when you say to. Frankly, I haven’t used it for more than a few 
minutes — it just doesn’t work well enough yet. Still, it’s kind of neat — and
worth playing with, if you have the time and a decent Mac microphone.
Text to Speech
Use this tab to set the voice your Mac uses to communicate with you. Choose
from the list of voices on the left side of the pane to select the voice your Mac
uses when it reads to you. After you make a selection, you can click the Play
button to play a sample of the voice you selected.
Use the Rate slider (bottom-right of the window) to speed up or slow down
the voice. Then click the Play button to hear this voice at its new speed.
I like Fred, who says, “I sure like being inside this fancy computer.”
These options are where you choose to have your Mac speak the text in alert
boxes and dialogs, such as, “The application Microsoft Word has quit unex-
pectedly” or “The Finder requires your attention.”
Two additional (and quite useful) settings are the Announce when an applica-
tion requires your attention and the Speak Selected Text when the Key is
Pressed check boxes. You assign the key by clicking the Set Key button.
301
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

If you want to have the clock announce the time, click the Open Date & Time
Preferences button and you’ll be whisked to that preference pane (which I
describe earlier in this chapter).
If you want to change your VoiceOver settings, click the Open Universal
Access Preferences button.
Startup Disk
This pane lets you select which hard drive, server volume, or hard-drive
volume (if you’ve partitioned your single hard drive or have more than one)
should act as the startup disk when more than one drive with system soft-
ware is connected to the Mac. To use it, first unlock the Startup Disk prefer-
ence if you have to (for more on unlocking a preference, see the “Using
System Preferences” section earlier in this chapter) and then click the icon
for the drive that you want to start up the Mac the next time that you restart.
This feature is very useful if you have both a Mac OS X startup disk and a
startup disk with another version of Mac OS on it (such as Mac OS 9 or Mac
OS 8.6). If you want to start up with the older operating system, just click that
disk’s icon in the Startup Disk System Preferences pane and restart your Mac;
doing so makes it start up with the selected OS.
If you have OS 9.2.2 installed on the same volume as OS X, you can set this
preference to choose which OS you boot from. You see two System Folder
icons at the top of the pane — one with OS 9.2.2 and the other with OS X.
Click the one that you want to boot from and then restart.
When you’ve selected the OS with which you want to restart, click the
Restart button in the window.
For more information on using the Startup Disk System Preference pane, skip
to the end of my discussion of the Classic environment in Chapter 12.
As I mention elsewhere in this book, Macs sold after January 1, 2003 may not
be able to boot into OS 9. They will still run Classic, but won’t be capable of
booting into 9.
Making it easier than ever before to restart your Mac in FireWire Target Disk
Mode is the Target Disk Mode button. Now you don’t have to plant your
finger on the T key when rebooting if you want to be in Target Disk Mode.
Universal Access
Many years ago, Apple pioneered Easy Access to assist computer users who
had disabilities or difficulty in handling the keyboard and mouse. Universal
Access is the OS X implementation of that assistance. This pane has a check
box and four tabs.
302
Part III: Doing Stuff with Your Mac 

Mark the Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box to use special equip-
ment to control your computer.
The VoiceOver section lets you turn VoiceOver on and off via Ô+F5. It also
includes a button that will open the VoiceOver utility for you so that you 
can customize VoiceOver to your heart’s content. I discuss VoiceOver in
Chapter 11 — it’s a really cool new Tiger technology that provides a verbal
English interface to Mac OS X. When VoiceOver is on, your Mac tells you 
what you have selected, where the cursor is located, and a load of other
information about what is being done, including typing.
The Seeing tab also lets you turn on a terrific feature: hardware zoom. Turn 
it on and off with the shortcut Ô+Option+8. Zoom in and out using the short-
cuts Ô+Option+= (equals key) and Ô+Option+– (minus key), respectively. 
Try this feature even if you’re not disabled or challenged in any way; it’s a
great feature for everyone.
You can also display the screen as white-on-black (like a photographic nega-
tive), as shown in Figure 13-13. The shortcut is Ô+Option+Control+8; use the
same keyboard shortcut to toggle back to normal. If you’re in the normal black-
on-white mode, you can desaturate your screen into a grayscale display (so it
works like a black-and-white TV).
Figure 13-13:

303
Chapter 13: What Your Mac Prefers

Finally, the Zoom Options button lets you specify minimum and maximum
zoom levels, display a preview rectangle when zoomed out, and toggle image
smoothing on or off.
The Hearing tab lets you choose to flash the screen whenever an alert sound
occurs.
This feature, created for those with impaired hearing, is quite useful if you
have a PowerBook or iBook and want to use it where ambient noise levels 
are high.
The Keyboard tab offers two types of assistance: Sticky Keys and Slow Keys.
The Sticky Keys application treats a sequence of modifier keys as a key com-
bination. In other words, you don’t have to simultaneously hold down Ô
while pressing another key. For example, with Sticky Keys enabled, you can
do a standard keyboard shortcut by pressing Ô, releasing it, and then press-
ing the other key. There are check boxes to tell you (with a beep and/or an
on-screen display) what modifier keys have been pressed.
As useful as Sticky Keys can be, they’re really awkward in applications like
Photoshop that toggle a tool’s state when you press a modifier key. So if
you’re a big Photoshop user, you probably don’t want Sticky Keys enabled.
Slow Keys lets you adjust the delay between when a key is pressed and when
that keypress is accepted.
Finally, the Mouse tab lets you specify that you want to use the keys on the
numeric keypad instead of the mouse. In this situation, everything centers 
on the numeric keypad’s 5 key (which means clicking the mouse): 8 is up; 2 is
down; 4 is left; 6 is right; and 1, 3, 7, and 9 are diagonal movements. Pressing
0 (zero) is the same as holding down the mouse button so the other numeric
keys can now drag in the indicated directions. You can also increase the
cursor size from the normal setting (16×16) to about 64×64.

In this part, I cover semi-advanced topics — including

H
ave you ever wanted to grab a file from your Mac while you were
halfway around the world or even around the corner? If so, I’ve got good
news for you — it’s not difficult with OS X (believe it or not) even though com-
puter networking in general has a well-deserved reputation for being compli-
cated and nerve-wracking. The truth is, you won’t encounter anything scary
or complicated about sharing files, folders, and disks (and printers, for that
matter) among computers as long as the computers are Macintoshes. And, if
some of the computers are running Windows, Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger
even makes that (almost) painless. Your Macintosh includes everything that
you need to share files and printers. Everything, that is, except the printers
and the cables (and maybe a hub). So here’s the deal: You supply the hard-
ware, and this chapter will supply the rest. And when you’re done hooking it
all up, you can take a rest.
Mac OS X is a multiuser operating system. After you create a user account for
someone to share your Mac, that user can log in to your Mac two different
ways with the same username and password. They can log in while sitting 
at your Mac or they can log in to your Mac from a remote location via the
Internet or a local-area network (LAN).

The first sections of this chapter provide an overview and tell you everything
that you need to know to set up new user accounts and share files success-
fully. I won’t show you how to actually share a file, folder, or disk until the
“Consummating the Act of Sharing” section later in this chapter. Trust me,
there’s a method to my madness. If you try to share files without doing all the
required prep work, the whole mess becomes confusing and complicated —
kind of like networking a pair of PC clones.
One last thing: If you’re the only one who uses your Mac and you don’t intend
to share it or its files with anyone else, you can safely skip this whole chapter
if you like.
Introducing File Sharing
Macintosh file sharing enables you to use files, folders, and disks from other
Macs on a network — any network, including the Internet — as easily as if
they were on your own local hard drive. If you have more than one computer,
file sharing is a must. It’s fun, it’s easy, and it’s way better than SneakerNet
(an ancient technology that moved files from one computer to another via
floppy disk or other hand-carried media such as CD-R, DVD-R, USB Flash
drives, and so on, according to the unpublished epic, “The Dr. Macintosh
Unabridged Dictionary”).
Before diving in and actually sharing, first check out a few necessary terms:
 Network: For our purposes, a network is two or more Macs connected
by Ethernet cables or AirPort wireless networking.
 Ethernet: A network protocol and cabling scheme that lets you connect
two or more computers so they can share files, disks, printers, or 
whatever.
 Ethernet ports: Where you plug an Ethernet cable into your Mac.
Be careful. On your Mac and printer, the Ethernet ports look a lot like
phone jacks, and the connectors on each end of an Ethernet cable look 
a lot like phone cable connectors. But they aren’t the same. Ethernet
cables are typically thicker, and the connectors (RJ-45 connectors) are a
bit larger than the RJ-11 connectors that you use with telephones. (See
examples of both types of connector ends in the margin.) When you 
connect an Ethernet cable to your Mac, you won’t be able to put it into
your RJ-11-friendly modem port (and you shouldn’t try). Standard phone
cables fit (very loosely) into Ethernet ports, but you shouldn’t try that
either — they’ll probably fall out with the slightest vibration. It’s unlikely
that either mistake will cause any permanent damage, but it won’t work
and will frustrate you to no end.
308
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

 Local devices: Devices connected directly to your computers, such as
hard drives or CD-ROM drives. Your internal hard drive, for example, is a
local device.
 Remote devices: Devices you access (share) over the network. The hard
drive of a computer in the next room, for example, is a remote device.
 Protocols: Kinds of languages that networks speak. When you read or
hear about networks, you’re likely to hear the words AppleTalk, EtherTalk
(or Ethernet), SMB, and TCP/IP bandied about with great regularity. These
are all protocols. Macs can speak several different protocols, but every
device (Mac or printer) on a network needs to speak the same protocol at
the same time in order to communicate.
Support for the AppleTalk protocol is built into every Mac. Your Mac
includes all the software that you need to set up an AppleTalk network;
the hardware that you need to provide comprises Ethernet cables and 
a hub (unless you use crossover cables) or an AirPort base station. I’m
using hub here generically — its more powerful cousins, switches and
routers, will also work. The AirPort base station, by the way, is a
member of the router class.
Although you can use Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
(TCP/IP) to do a lot of the same things that you can with AppleTalk, I con-
centrate on Apple’s protocol, AppleTalk. By learning how to activate and
use it, you’ll master the basics that you need to dig into the language of
the Internet.
AppleTalk is particularly useful when you have all Macs on your net-
work. It’s the easiest to configure and doesn’t require additional informa-
tion such as IP addresses. If you want to use the Internet to connect to
another computer (or have it connect to yours), however, you have to
use TCP/IP.
Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar added support for a protocol called
Bluetooth, and this support was enhanced in OS X 10.3 Panther and
again in OS X 10.4 Tiger. Bluetooth offers wireless connectivity with
devices such as cell phones in addition to other computers; however, it
only works over very short ranges and at lower speeds than Ethernet or
AirPort. Unlike AppleTalk and TCP/IP, Bluetooth support is not included
with most Macs as standard equipment. You can order Bluetooth sup-
port as a build-to-order option on some Macs, and you can use a USB
adapter, known as a dongle, on Macs that don’t offer built-in Bluetooth
support. The bottom line is that while you could use Bluetooth for net-
working Macs, due to its slower speed and shorter range, I limit the rest
of this discussion to the protocols all Mac OS X users already have on
their Mac — AppleTalk and TCP/IP.
309
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

Portrait of home office networking
A typical Mac home office network consists of two Macintoshes, an Ethernet
hub, and a network printer (usually a laser printer, although networked inkjet
printers are becoming more common). Check out Figure 14-1 to see the con-
figuration of a simple network. In the figure, the black lines between the
devices are Ethernet cables; the rectangular device with those cables going
into it is a hub. (I tell you more about cables and hubs in the section “Three
ways to build a network” later in this chapter.) You need enough Ethernet
cable to run among all your devices.
With the setup shown in Figure 14-1, either Mac can use the other Mac’s files,
and both Macs can print to the same printer.
A network can and often does have, however, dozens or hundreds of users.
Regardless of whether your network has 2 nodes (machines) or 2,000, the
principles and techniques in this chapter apply.
Three ways to build a network
Back when you could connect a whole bunch of Macs and printers by simply
running cables among them, most small Mac networks were pretty much the
same. You attached a small device (a LocalTalk connector) to the first Mac,
and then ran plain old telephone cable to the next Mac, which also had a
LocalTalk connector. By stringing more phone cable and more LocalTalk con-
nectors, you had yourself a little network.
Today, building a Mac network is a little more complicated. Macs that sup-
port Mac OS X Tiger don’t include LocalTalk ports — and Ethernet and wire-
less networks require a little more setup.

Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

In this chapter, I assume that you’re working on a small network, the kind typ-
ically found in a home or small business. If you’re part of a mega-monstrous
corporate network and you have questions about your particular network,
talk to the PIC (person in charge, also known as your network administrator). 
If you’re trying to build one of these mega-networks, you’ll need a book a lot
thicker and harder to understand than this one.
The following list gives you three common ways to build a modern network:
 AirPort: If all your Macs are equipped with AirPort wireless cards and if
you have the AirPort Base Station, you don’t need cables at all. Just plug
in the base station, and Macs with AirPort cards can communicate with
each other. If you use an Ethernet printer (connected to your Mac by
Ethernet cable), you need to connect it to the base station before you
can print from your wireless Macs. Both the Base Station and printer
have Ethernet ports, so you can use a crossover cable to make the con-
nection.
Although this setup is more expensive than Ethernet cables and a hub,
it’s also more flexible because you can move your devices anywhere.
(Well, almost anywhere; you’re limited to 150 feet per AirPort and that’s
assuming that there’s nothing in the way to block your signal.)
For more information about wireless networking, check out the Apple
AirPort Web page at www.apple.com/airport/.
 Small Ethernet: If you have only two devices to network (two Macs, or a
Mac and an Ethernet printer, in most cases), you can use an Ethernet
crossover cable to connect them directly to one another via the
Ethernet ports. You can purchase a crossover cable (which looks just
311
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
To cross over, or not?
The type of Ethernet cable required to connect
two Macs without a hub or other middle-device
has changed over time. In the old days, you
absolutely had to have a crossover cable or the
Macs wouldn’t be able to see each other.
The basic rule had always been that to connect
two Macs, you had to use a crossover cable. And
if you had a hub or router or other intermediary
device, you had to use regular Ethernet cables.
That’s less true today because many Macs built
in the past couple years — and every Mac sold
today — has new and improved Ethernet that
can determine what type of cable (regular or
crossover) you’re using and then automatically
adjust itself so cable works properly.
These days, you may encounter three possibili-
ties: If you want to connect two older Macs, you
need a crossover cable. If you want to connect
an older Mac to a newer Mac, you may or may
not need a crossover cable. And if you want to
connect twolate-model Macs, you can use either
a regular Ethernet cable or a crossover cable.
When in doubt, check Mac OS Help in the Help
menu (press Ô+Shift+?).

like a standard Ethernet cable) at your local electronics store. Note: Be
sure to ask for a crossover cable, or your network might not work (see
the sidebar “To cross over, or not?”). Plug one end of the crossover
cable into one device, and the other end into the other device.
An Ethernet crossover cable won’t work with a hub; a regular Ethernet
cable won’t work without one in many Macs (as explained in the sidebar
“To cross over, or not?”). Therefore, it makes sense to label your crossover
cable(s) as such because they look exactly like regular Ethernet cables,
and it’s easy to become confused if you have a bunch of similar-looking
cables.
 Traditional Ethernet: All modern Macs have an Ethernet port. To con-
nect your Mac to a network, you need Ethernet cables for each Mac and
a little device called a hub. (A hub is like the center of a wagon wheel;
the wires coming out of it are the “spokes.”) A typical Ethernet hub
includes two to eight Ethernet ports. You plug the hub in to an electrical
outlet and then connect Ethernet cables from each of your Macs and
printers (from their Ethernet ports) to the hub. Voilà! — instant network.
Hubs are pretty cheap, starting below $10; cables start at a few bucks,
increasing in price as the length (and quality and shielding) of the cable
increases.
If you have a cable modem or Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) as your
Internet connection, you may need a router or switch instead of a hub.
They’re similar but cost a bit more and have additional features that you
may or may not need. Your ISP can tell you whether you’re going to need
one. For what it’s worth, I have a cable modem, but it works fine with a
cheap hub; I didn’t need a more expensive router until I wanted to have
more than one of the Macs talking to the Internet at the same time.
Setting Up File Sharing
Before I get into the nitty-gritty of sharing files, you must complete a few
housekeeping tasks, such as turning on file sharing, turning on AppleTalk 
(if you want to share files with an AppleTalk-enabled file server or print to 
an AppleTalk printer), and enabling sharing over TCP/IP (that is, over the
Internet) if you plan to share that way.
Turning on file sharing
Before you can share files, you have to turn on Mac OS X’s built-in File
Sharing feature. Follow these steps to do so:
312
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

1. From the Ú menu, choose System Preferences (or click the System
Preferences icon on the Dock) and then click the Sharing icon.
The System Preferences Sharing pane appears. Unless you’ve changed it,
your long user name appears by default as the Computer Name. 
2. If you want to change the computer name at this time, do so in the
Computer Name text field at the top of the Sharing pane.
In Figure 14-2, you can see that I named mine G4iMac. You can name
yours anything you like.
3. On the Services pane, mark the sharing services that you want to use
(such as Personal File Sharing) and then click the Start button
(beneath the heading Personal File Sharing Off).
Alternatively, you can just click inside the check box in the On column to
activate file sharing (see Figure 14-2).
Why does it say Personal File Sharing Off above the button?
Because it is off. After you click the Start button, the button name
changes from Start to Stop, and the text above the button changes to
Personal File Sharing On, indicating that file sharing is on.

Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

Starting AppleTalk
If you want to share files with an Apple file server or print to a networked
printer that requires AppleTalk, as many do, you have to enable AppleTalk.
(See the “Introducing File Sharing” section earlier in this chapter for a defini-
tion of AppleTalk.) Here’s how:
1. From the Ú menu, choose System Preferences (or click the System
Preferences icon on the Dock).
The System Preferences window appears.
2. In the System Preferences window, click the Network icon (located in
the toolbar and also in the main part of the window).
The Network System Preferences pane appears.
You can get here in one step by choosing Ú➪Location➪Network
Preferences.
3. If the pane is locked, click the lock icon (bottom-left corner) to unlock
the Network System Preferences, type an Administrator name and
password, and then click OK.
If your Mac is set up for multiple users, only users with administrative
privileges (or, at least, knowledge of the Administrator password) can
unlock these locks. Those with such privileges are the first user (created
when you installed OS X) and any other user to whom you’ve given
administrative privileges in the Accounts System Preferences pane
(which I discuss in the “Access and Privileges: Who Can Do What” sec-
tion later in this chapter).
4. Choose Built-in Ethernet or AirPort (whichever you use) from the
Show pop-up menu (if it isn’t already chosen) and then click the
AppleTalk tab.
The AppleTalk view of the Network System Preferences pane appears in
all its glory — on-screen and in Figure 14-3.
5. Mark the Make AppleTalk Active check box.
6. Click the Apply Now button in the lower-right corner of the AppleTalk
tab to confirm your action.
That’s it. You can quit the System Preferences application now.
Sharing with TCP/IP
TCP/IP is the network protocol used on the Internet. It’s also the protocol
used by OS X for sharing files. It enables Macs, PCs, and other computers to
communicate with each other (sometimes, but not always, via the Internet),
even if they’re running different operating systems. TCP/IP is always on, so
you don’t have to do anything further about it.
314
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

If you want remote users to be able to use an File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
client program (instead of using File Sharing on another Mac) to upload and
download files to and from this computer, mark the FTP Access check box in
the Sharing System Preferences pane’s Services pane. If you want to enable
Windows or Linux — or users of other operating systems to share files with
you — this check box needs to be marked. (I talk more about FTP and FTP
clients in Chapter 19.) Windows users can also share files if you turn on
Windows File Sharing in the Sharing pane’s Services pane. This feature, intro-
duced in Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar, takes most of the pain out of working
with people using Microsoft Windows systems.
Mac users could use an FTP client to access your Mac, but they’ll probably
want to use File Sharing instead because it’s easier.
Security risks are involved in allowing FTP access. I strongly suggest that you
go to Apple’s Web site (www.apple.com) and read about them before you
enable this feature.
Computers connect to one another by using a number-based addressing
system (an IP address) that’s standard all over the world. You can (and most
big companies do) use this system to communicate in offices and over the
Internet. If you need to know more about using TCP/IP to connect to comput-
ers on your network than I’ve told you here, talk to the system administrator
or the network geek in charge of these things where you work.

Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

I touch more on TCP/IP in the “Connecting to a shared disk or folder on a
remote” section later in this chapter where you can read how to use it to 
connect to a Mac or other server that’s running it.
Bonjour (previously known as Rendezvous), the relatively new, zero-
configuration network protocol included in Mac OS X version 10.2 Jaguar
(and later versions, of course) makes networking simple. If two devices (and
this includes all Macs running version 10.2 Jaguar or later) speak Bonjour,
you don’t have to do any configuration (besides turning on the sharing capa-
bility). Bonjour queries the other available networked devices to see what
services they offer and support and then configures the connections for you
automatically.
Access and Privileges: Who Can Do What
Before you can share your Mac with other users or share files over a network,
you need to tell your Mac who is allowed to do what. Luckily for you, this
process just happens to be what I cover in this section.
Users and groups and guests
Macintosh file sharing (and indeed, Mac OS X as well) is based on the con-
cept of users. Shared items — drives or folders — can be shared with no
users, one user, or many users, depending on your needs.
 Users: People who share folders and drives (or your Mac) are users. A
user’s access to items on your local hard drive is entirely at your discre-
tion. You can configure your Mac so only you can access its folders and
drives or so only one other person (or everyone) can share its folders
and drives.
When you first set up your Mac, you created your first user. This user
automatically has administrative powers, such as adding more users,
changing preferences, and having the clearance to see all folders on the
hard drive.
For the purposes of this book, I assume that some users for whom you
create identities won’t be folks who actually sit at your Mac, but rather
those who only connect to it from a remote location when they need to
give or get files. But they could use the same name and password to log
in while sitting at your desk.
For all intents and purposes, a remote user and a local user are the
same. In other words, after you create an account for a user, that user
can log in to this Mac while sitting in your chair in your office or log in to
this Mac from a remote location via AppleTalk/Ethernet or the Internet.
316
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

 Administrative users: Although a complete discussion of the special
privileges that a user with administrator privileges has on a Mac running
OS X is far beyond the scope of this book, note two important things:
• The first user created (usually when you install OS X for the first
time) is automatically granted administrator (admin) powers.
• Only an administrator can create new users, delete some (but not
all) files from folders that aren’t in his or her Home folder, lock and
unlock System Preference panes, and a bunch of other stuff. If you
try something and it doesn’t work, make sure you’re logged in as a
user with admin privileges.
You can give any user administrator privileges by selecting that user’s
account, clicking the Password tab, and then selecting the Allow User to
Administer This Computer check box in the Password pane. You can set
this check box when creating the user account or subsequently.
 Groups: Groups are UNIX-level designations for privilege consolidation.
For example, there are groups named staff and wheel (as well as a
bunch of others). Your main account, for example, is in the wheel group.
If you’re wondering whether you can create your own groups, as you
could under OS 9 and earlier Mac operating systems, the answer is, well,
yes and no. If you want to delve into the intricacies of the NetInfo
Manager application to do it yourself, then “Yes;” but if you don’t, then
the answer is “No, please don’t.” UNIX-related tasks such as this are far
beyond the scope of this book. Very far beyond. . . .
 Guests: Those who access public folders on your Mac via file sharing 
are guests. They don’t need a username or password. If they’re on your
network, they can see and use your public folder(s), unless you or the
public folder’s owner has altered the permissions on one or more public
folders. If they’re on the Internet and know your IP address, they can see
and use your Public folder(s). Public folders are all that guests can
access, luckily.
Creating users
Before users can share folders and drives (or share your computer for that
matter), you need to create user identities for them. You perform this little
task in the Accounts System Preferences pane.
Guests can use your public folder(s) — but no other folders — without
having a user account.
To create users for the purposes of file sharing, you need to add the user as 
a user of your computer, too. In other words, giving a user access to certain
folders on your system means that that user also has folders of his or her
own on the Mac. When you add (create) a user, you need to tell your Mac
317
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

who this person is. This is also the time to set passwords and administrative
powers of this new user. Here’s the drill:
1. From the Ú menu, choose System Preferences (or click the System
Preferences icon on the Dock), click the Accounts icon, and then
make sure that the Password pane is selected.
The Accounts System Preferences pane appears. In this pane (shown in
Figure 14-4), you can see the name of the first user (boblevitus) and
the administrative control that this user has (look beneath the user’s
name).
As I mention previously, the first user created (usually at the same time
you installed OS X) always has administrator privileges.
2. Click the + button beneath the list of users.
All the text fields in the Password pane empty out, waiting for you to fill
in the new user’s account information.
If the + button is dimmed, you’ll need to first click the lock (lower-
left), supply an admin user name and password in the resulting
dialog, and then click OK.
A sheet appears in which you enter the new user’s information.
3. In the Name text box, type the full name of a user you want to add.
In the Short Name text box, your Mac inserts a suggested abbreviated
name (or short name, as it’s called). Check out Figure 14-5 to see both.

Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

In Figure 14-5, I added Steve Jobs as a user, typing the full name in the
Name field. You don’t really need to type the user’s full name, but I do so
in this example to show you the difference between a name and a short
name.
The name of each user’s folder (in the Users folder) is taken from the
short name that you enter when you create a user.
4. Press the Tab key to move to the next field.
Mac OS X suggests an abbreviated version of the name in the Short
Name field (as shown in Figure 14-5). Because he’s the only Steve that
matters around here, I’ll change the suggested stevejobs to just plain
steve, which is shorter than the short name recommended by OS X. 
(In other words, I type steve into the Short Name field, replacing the 
suggested stevejobs.)
Users can connect to your Mac (or log in to their own Macs, for that
matter) by using the short name, rather than having to type their full
names. The short name is also used in environments in which user-
names can’t have spaces and are limited to eight or fewer characters.
Although OS X Panther allows longer user names (but no spaces), you
may be better off keeping your short name shorter than eight charac-
ters, just in case.
5. Tab to the New Password field and enter an initial password for this
user.
The small, square button with the key to the Password field’s right,
when clicked, displays the Password Assistant (Figure 14-6). You can 
use the Password Assistant to help generate a password that should 
be fairly easy to remember but hard for a cracking program to guess 
or meet other requirements.
Figure 14-5:

6. Press the Tab key on your keyboard to move your cursor to the Verify
text field.
7. In the Verify text box, type the password again to verify it.
8. (Optional) To help remember a password, type something to jog the
user’s memory in the Password Hint text box.
If a user forgets his or her password and asks for a hint, the text that you
type in the Password Hint field will pop up, hopefully causing the user 
to exclaim, “Oh yeah . . . now I remember!” A password hint should be
something simple enough to jog the user’s memory but not so simple
that an unauthorized person may guess. Perhaps something like “Your
first teddy bear’s name backwards” would be a good hint.
9. Click Create Account.
The sheet closes, returning you to the Password pane.
10. If you want this user to administer the Mac (that is, have access to
preferences, be able to create users, and so forth, select the Allow
User to Administer This Computer check box.
11. (Optional) Click the Picture Tab to assign a picture to the user.
OS X will suggest one from its default collection, but you can select a 
different one from the scrolling row, drag one in from the Finder (or
iPhoto), or take one with an attached camera (such as an iSight).
The new user now appears in the Accounts System Preferences pane’s
Users list.
Changing a user
Circumstances might dictate that you need to change a user’s identity, pass-
word, or accessibility, or perhaps delete a user. Follow these steps to change
a user’s name, password, or administration privileges:
1. From the Ú menu, choose System Preferences (or click the System
Preferences icon on the Dock).
The System Preferences window appears.
Figure 14-6:

2. In the System Preferences window, click the Accounts icon.
The Accounts System Preferences pane appears.
3. Click the user’s name in the scrolling list to select it.
The information for that person appears in the Password view.
4. Make your changes by selecting the existing username or short name
and then replacing the old with new text or a different setting.
• If you want to change the password, click the Change Password
button and make your changes in the sheet that appears. 
• To change the picture or other capabilities, click the Picture, Login
Items, or Parental Control tabs and make the appropriate changes.
In order to change a user, you must be logged in using an account that
has administrator powers.
5. Quit the System Preferences application or choose a different System
Preference pane. 
Your changes are saved when you leave the Accounts pane.
Removing a user
To delete a user — in effect, to deny that user access to your Mac — select
the user you want to delete in the list of accounts and then click the – button.
You will be asked to confirm that you really want to delete the user. Click OK
to delete the user but save their Home folder files in the Deleted Users folder
or click Delete Immediately to delete the user and his or her Home folder.
To remove a user from your Mac, you must be logged in using an account
that has administrator privileges. When you delete the user, the files and 
folders that user owned will now be in the Deleted Users folder in a Disk
Image file.
Limiting a user’s capabilities
Sometimes — especially with younger children or computer-phobic family
members — you want to limit what they can access. For example, you might
want to make certain programs off-limits. With Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger,
you do this via the Parental Controls tab in the Accounts System Preferences
pane.
1. From the Ú menu, choose System Preferences (or click the System
Preferences icon on the Dock).
The System Preferences window appears.
321
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

2. In the System Preferences window, click the Accounts icon.
The Accounts System Preferences pane appears.
3. Click the user’s name once to select it, and then click the Parental
Controls tab.
The access information for that person appears, as shown in Figure 14-7.
Note that you can’t limit an account with administrator privileges.
4. Select the check box corresponding to a user capability you want to
restrict, then click that capability’s Configure (or Info) button.
• Mail: Provide a list of approved mail correspondents.
• Finder and System: Determine which applications the user may
access, whether they can print, burn optical discs, modify the
Dock, access System Preferences, or be restricted to a very limited
and simplified Finder interface. Figure 14-8 shows the sheet where
you can limit access.
• iChat: Provide a list of approved iChat communicants.
• Safari: Limit the Web sites the user can visit.
• Dictionary: Limited Dictionary access reduces the number of
words that can be looked up, eliminating such things as profanity.
In order to change a user’s capabilities, you must be logged in using an
account that has Administrator powers.

Mac OS X knows best: Folders 
shared by default
When you add users in the Accounts System Preferences pane as I describe
earlier in this chapter, Mac OS X automatically does two things behind the
scenes to facilitate file sharing: It creates a set of folders, and it makes some
of them available for sharing.
Each time you add a user, Mac OS X creates a folder hierarchy for that user
on the Mac, as I describe in Chapter 6. The user can create more folders (if
necessary) and also add, remove, or move anything inside of these folders.
Even if you open a user account solely to allow him or her to exchange files
with you, your Mac automatically creates a folder for that user. Unless you, 
as the owner of your Mac, give permission, the user can’t see inside — or 
use folders outside the Home folder (which has the user’s name) — with only
three exceptions: the Shared folder in the Users folder, the top level of other
user account folders, and the Public and Shared folders in every other user’s
folder. A description of the latter follows:
Figure 14-8:

Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

 Public: A Public folder is located inside each user’s folder. That folder is
set up to be accessible (shared) by any user who can log in to the Mac.
Furthermore, any user can log in (as a guest) and copy things out of this
folder as long as he knows your Mac’s IP address, even if he doesn’t
have an account on this Mac at all. Files put into the Public folder can 
be opened or copied freely.
Inside each user’s Public folder is a Drop Box folder. Just like the name
implies, this folder is where others can drop a file or folder for you. Only
the owner can open the Drop Box to see what’s inside or to move or
copy the files that are in it. Imagine a street corner mailbox — after you
drop your letter in, it’s gone, and you can’t get it back out.
 Shared: In addition to a Public folder for each user, Mac OS X creates
one Shared folder on every Mac for all users of this Mac. The Shared
folder isn’t available to guests, but it’s available to every person who has
an account on this machine, when they’re logged in at the machine. You
find the Shared folder within the Users folder (the same folder where you
find folders for each user). The Shared folder is the right place to put stuff
that everyone with an account might want to use. In Figure 14-9, you can
see a Users folder where drc and spenser have user folders. You can also
see the Shared folder that both of them can use.
Here’s an example of how all this works. If Dennis R. Cohen (my rockin’ tech-
nical editor on this book) has a user account called drc on his Mac, he can
log in and work with any item in his user directory — the drc Home folder.
He can also put files in his Shared folder that he wants to share with others
users who sit at this particular Mac. Or he can put them in the Public folder if
he wants them available to everyone with an account as well as guests logged
in remotely via a LAN or the Internet. If drc wants to share a file with just
spenser, he can put it in the Public folder under the spenser user account;
or, if he wants to be sure that no one but spenser sees it, he can put it into
the Drop Box folder inside the Public folder for spenser. The privileges that
okay all this activity are set up when the user account is created — you don’t
have to lift a finger.
Sharing a folder or disk 
by setting privileges
As you might expect, access privileges control who can use a given folder or
any disk (or partition) other than the startup disk.
Why can’t you share the startup disk? Because OS X won’t let you. Why not?
Because it contains the operating system and other stuff that nobody else
should have access to.
324
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

Throughout the rest of this chapter, whenever I talk about sharing a folder, I
also mean sharing disks and disk partitions other than your startup disk (which,
when you think of it, are nothing more than big folders anyway). Why am I
telling you this? Because it’s awkward to keep typing “a folder or any disk (or
partition) other than your startup disk.” So anything that I say about sharing
a folder also applies to sharing any disk (or partition) other than your
startup disk. Got it?
You can set access privileges for the folder’s owner, for a subset of all the
people having accounts on the Mac (a group), or for everyone who has the
Mac’s address whether they have an account or not (guests). To help you 
get a better handle on these relationships, a closer look at privileges, owners,
and groups is coming right up.
Contemplating privileges
When you consider who can use which folders, there are three distinct kinds
of users on the network. I describe each of them in this section. Then, in the
“Useful settings for access privileges” section later in this chapter, I show you
how to share folders with each of them.
 Owner: The owner of a folder or disk can change the access privileges
to that folder or disk at any time. The name you enter when you log in 
to your Mac — or the name of your Home folder — is the default owner
of shared folders and drives on that machine. Ownership can be given
away (more on that in the “Useful settings for access privileges” section
later in this chapter). Even if you own the Mac, you can’t change access
privileges for a folder on it that belongs to another user (unless you get
UNIX-y and do so as root). The owner must be logged in to change privi-
leges on his or her folders.
Figure 14-9:

folder.
325
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

OS X is the owner of many folders outside the Users folder. If OS X owns
it, you’ll see that system is its owner, as shown in Figure 14-10. Folders
that aren’t in the User directories generally belong to System.
You can change those access privileges without resorting to third-party
utilities or using the Terminal (which I describe briefly in Chapter 11), 
as was necessary in OS X versions before Jaguar. But be careful: It’s not 
a good idea to change them unless you know exactly what you’re doing
and why. Unfortunately, that discussion is far beyond the purview of this
book.
 Group member: In UNIX systems, all users belong to one or more groups.
The group that includes everyone who has an account with administrator
privileges on your Mac is called admin. Everyone in the admin group has
access to Shared and Public folders over the network as well as to any
folder that the admin group has been granted access to by the folder’s
owner.
 Others: This category is an easy way to set access privileges for every-
one with an account on your Mac at once. Unlike the admin group, which
includes only users with administrative privileges, others includes, well,
everyone (everyone with an account on this Mac, that is).
If you want people without an account on this Mac to have access to a
file or folder, it needs to go in your Public folder, where they can log in 
as a guest.

Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

Sharing a folder
Suppose you have a folder you want to share but it has slightly different rules
than those set up for the Public folder, the Drop Box folder within, or for your
personal folders. These rules are privileges, and they tell you how much
access someone has to your stuff.
Actually, the rules governing Shared and Public folders are privileges, too,
but they’re set up for you when Mac OS X is installed.
I suggest that you only share folders located within your Home folder (or a
folder within it). Because of the way UNIX works, the UNIX permissions of 
the enclosing folder can prevent access to a folder for which you do have 
permissions. Trust me, if you only share folders in your Home folder, you’ll
never go wrong. If you don’t take this advice, you could wind up having fold-
ers that other users can’t access, even though you gave them the appropriate
permission.
You can set access privileges for folders within your Public folder (like the
Drop Box folder) that are different from those for the rest of the folder.
327
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It
Whatever happened to users and groups?
Mac OS X users who have used Mac OS 9 might
wonder what’s happened to the Users and
Groups feature, which enabled you to create any
number of user groups on a Mac. Because Mac
OS X is based on the UNIX operating system,
which deals very differently with permissions and
access privileges than older versions of Mac OS
did, it can’t support old-style users and groups.
If you’re brave or knowledgeable enough to dig
into UNIX, you can make your own groups in
Mac OS X. Creating a UNIX group confers iden-
tical access privileges and powers on all its
members. Although the process of creating a
group is beyond the scope of this book, the
process basically involves either gaining root
access to the UNIX system and working from
the Terminal command line or tinkering with the
groups directory by using NetInfo Manager
(which requires Administrator access).
If you feel adventurous and know a little UNIX,
try this: Open the Terminal program (in the
Utilities folder inside the Applications folder) and
type man group. Terminal will display the manual
pages for the topic group. Press Space as many
times as needed to scroll through the entire doc-
ument. It probably won’t help you create a group,
but reading it won’t hurt anything.
The admin group includes every user of a given
Mac who has administrative privileges. Although
it’s not as flexible as the old Users and Groups
feature (in OS 9 and earlier), it’s better than no
groups at all and is a lot more secure than the OS
9 group functionality.

I said this before, but it bears repeating: Whenever I talk about sharing a
folder, I also mean disks and disk partitions other than your startup disk
(which you just can’t share, period). So don’t forget that anything I say about
sharing a folder also applies to sharing any disk (or partition) other than
your startup disk. Though you can’t explicitly share your startup disk,
anyone with Administrator access can mount it for sharing from across the
network (or Internet).
To share a folder with another user, follow these steps:
1. Select (single-click) the folder or drive icon and then choose File➪
Get Info (or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+I).
The Info window for the selected item opens.
2. Click the triangle to the left of the Ownership & Permissions panel
near the bottom of the window, and then click the Details disclosure
triangle.
The privileges options appear, as you see in Figure 14-11.
3. Set access privileges for this folder by using the Access Privileges pop-
up menus to control how much access each type of user has to the
shared folder or drive.
When you click one of these pop-up menus, you see the privilege
description.
Figure 14-11:

Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

You can choose from three types of access for each user or group, as
shown in Table 14-1.
If you are the folder’s owner (or have Administrator access), you can
click the padlock icon and change the owner and/or group for the file 
or folder.
Table 14-1
Access Privileges
Access Privilege
What It Allows
Read & Write
A user with read-and-write access can see, add,
delete, move, and edit files just as if they were stored
on his or her own computer.
Read Only
A read-only user can see and use files that are stored in
a shared folder but can’t add, delete, move, or edit them.
Write Only (Drop Box)
Users can add files to this folder but can’t see what’s in
it. The user must have read access to the folder con-
taining a Write Only folder.
No Access
With no privileges, a user can neither see nor use your
shared folders or drives.
Useful settings for access privileges
The following sections show you just some of the more common ways that
you can combine access privileges for a folder. You’ll probably find one
option that fits the way you work and the people you want to share with.
Allow everyone access
In Figure 14-12, I configure settings that allow access for everyone on a net-
work. Everyone can open, read, and change the contents of this shared
folder. Do this by choosing Read & Write for Others in the Access pop-up
menu in the Ownership & Permissions section of the folder’s Get Info window.
Owner privileges must be at least as expansive as Group privileges and Group
privileges must be at least as expansive as Others privileges. So, to set Others
to Read & Write means that Group and Owner must also be set to Read &
Write.
Allow nobody but yourself access
The settings shown in Figure 14-13 reflect appropriate settings that allow
owner-only access. No one but me can see or use the contents of this shared
folder. Choose No Access in both the Group Access and the Others pop-up
menus to do it yourself.

Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

You need to change the Others pop-up menu to No Access first because
Group member privileges must be at least as broad as Others privileges.
Allow all administrative users of this Mac access
Check out Figure 14-14 to see settings that allow the group wheel (in addition
to the owner) access to see, use, or change the contents of the shared folder.
Choose Read & Write in the Group Access pop-up menu.
Allow others to deposit files and folders without 
giving them access (a Drop Box)
The settings in Figure 14-15 enable users to drop their own files or folders
without being able to see or use the contents of the shared folder. After a file
or folder is deposited in a drop folder, the dropper can’t retrieve it because
he or she doesn’t have access privileges to see the items in the drop folder.
To let everyone use this folder as a Drop Box, choose Write Only (Drop Box)
from both the Group Access and the Others pop-up menus.
Read-only bulletin boards
If you want everyone to be able to open and read the files and folders in this
shared folder, choose Read Only from the Group Access and the Others pop-
up menus. If you do this, however, only the owner can make changes to files
in this folder.
Figure 14-14:

331
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

One more privilege
The Apply to Enclosed Items button, at the bottom of the access privileges
section, does exactly what its name implies. This feature is a fast way to
assign the same privileges to many subfolders at once. After you set privi-
leges for the enclosing folder the way you like them, click this button to give
these same privileges to all folders inside it.
Be careful — there is no Undo for this action.
Consummating the Act of Sharing
After you set up sharing and assign access privileges, you can access folders
remotely from another computer. (Just make sure first that you have access
privileges to it.)
File sharing must be activated on the Mac where the shared files/folders
reside; it does not have to be activated on the Mac that’s accessing the
files/folders. When file sharing is turned off, you can still use that Mac to
access a remote shared folder on another machine as long as its owner has
granted you enough access privileges and has file sharing enabled on his or
her Mac.
Figure
14-15:
Everyone

332
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

If file sharing is turned off on your Mac, though, others won’t be able to
access your folders, even if you’ve assigned access privileges to them previ-
ously.
If you’re going to share files and you leave your Mac on and unattended for a
long time, logging out before you leave it is a very good idea. This prevents
anyone just walking up to your Mac from seeing your files, e-mail, applica-
tions, or anything else that’s yours — unless you have given them a user
account and granted them access privileges for your files.
Connecting to a shared disk 
or folder on a remote
On to how to access your Home folder from a remote Mac — a super-cool fea-
ture that’s only bound to get more popular as the Internet continues to
mature.
The following steps assume you’ve got an account on the remote Mac, which
means you have your own Home folder on that Mac.
To connect to a shared folder on a Mac other than the one you’re currently
on, follow these steps:
1. Make sure that you are already set up as a user on the computer that
you want to log in to (DoctorMacDualG5 in this example).
If you need to know how to create a new user, see the “Creating users”
section earlier in the chapter.
2. On the computer that you’re logging in from (TigerTiBook in this
example), choose Go➪Connect to Server.
The Connect to Server dialog appears.
3. Click the Browse button.
A Finder window opens, set to show (aliases to) all the computers avail-
able on your local network, as shown in Figure 14-16.
You can combine Steps 2 and 3 by clicking Network in a Finder window
sidebar.
4. Double-click the remote Mac’s name (DoctorMacDualG5) in the Finder
window.
If the Network window is in column view, you’ll also see a Connect
button in the column to the right of the remote Mac’s name, as shown in
Figure 14-15. Clicking the Connect button serves the same purpose as
double-clicking that remote Mac’s icon.
333
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

The Connect dialog appears. The name of the person logged in on
TigerTiBook automatically appears in the Name field (Bob LeVitus in
Figure 14-17). If that’s not you, type your username in the Name field.

You would mark the Guest radio button if you didn’t have an account on
DoctorMacDualG5. 
Pressing Ô+G is the same as marking the Guest radio button, and press-
ing Ô+R is the same as marking the Registered User radio button. 
As a guest user, you see only Drop Boxes for users who have accounts
on DoctorMacDualG5 but nothing else. A registered user (somebody like
me in this example) also sees his Home folder plus everyone else’s
Public folder.
If I check the Remember Password in Keychain check box in the Connect
dialog, Mac OS X will remember my password for me the next time I con-
nect to a server. Sweet!
TCP/IP must be active on TigerTiBook (the Mac I’m using in the exam-
ple). If it’s not, you won’t see any other machines on the network — nor
will you be able to use any remote shared folders. In other words, file
sharing doesn’t have to be turned on (on the computer you’re using),
but TCP/IP does.
5. Type your password into the Password field and then click the
Connect button.
When you log in to a Mac on which you have a user account, you see a
volume with your name representing your Home folder on the Mac you’re
logging into. If you have Administrator privileges on that Mac, you may
also see other hard drives connected to that Mac or an iDisk if one is in
use.
6. Select the volume that you want to use (such as bobl in Figure 14-18)
and then click OK.
An icon appears on your Desktop (the Desktop of TigerTiBook), as shown
in Figure 14-19. This icon represents a volume named bobl, which resides
on the computer DoctorMacDualG5. Notice that the icon for bobl doesn’t
look like a drive or folder icon. This icon is what you see whenever a
remote volume is mounted on your Desktop. You’ll also see it if you add 
a server to your Favorites folder (more on that later) or view a server in
the Finder window.
Open the volume icon, and its folder window appears (also called bobl),
as shown in Figure 14-19. 
Unsharing a folder
To unshare a folder that you own, change the Group Access and Others privi-
leges to None. After you do, nobody but you will have access to that folder.

Disconnecting from a shared volume
When you finish using the shared volume, disconnect by using one of these
methods:
 Drag the shared folder icon to the Eject icon in the dock.
When a disk or volume is selected (highlighted), the Trash icon turns
into a little arrow, which represents eject. Nice touch, eh?
 Hold down the Control key, click the volume, and then choose Eject from
the contextual menu that appears.
 Select the icon and choose File➪Eject.
 Select the icon and press Ô+E.
 In a Finder window Sidebar, click the little Eject symbol to the right of
the server’s name or select the server and choose Eject from the Action
pop-up.
 If you’ve finished working for the day, choose Shut Down or Log Out from
the Ú menu. Shutting down or logging out automatically disconnects you
from shared disks or folders. (Shut Down also turns off your Mac.)
Changing your password
You can change your password at any time. Changing your password is a
good idea if you’re concerned about security — for example, if there’s a
chance your password has been discovered by someone else.
You can change the password for your Mac, or you can change the password
you use to connect to your account on a remote user’s Mac. I show you how
to do both in the following sections.
Changing your Mac’s password
To change the password on your Mac, just follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Ú menu on the Finder’s menu
bar (or click the System Preferences icon in the Dock) and then click
the Accounts icon.
The Accounts System Preference pane appears.
2. Select your account in the list on the left.
Your account information appears in the area on the right.
337
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

3. Click the Change Password button.
A sheet drops down.
4. Type your current password into Old Password field.
This demonstrates that you are who you’re supposed to be and not
someone who just walked up to your unattended Mac.
5. Type your new password into the Password field in the Password
pane.
6. Retype your password in the Verify field.
7. Click the Change Password button.
Assuming you entered your old password correctly, the sheet disap-
pears.
8. Close the System Preferences window.
Changing the password for your account on someone else’s Mac
When you log in to a remote Mac, you can change your own password if you
like. Follow these steps to do so:
1. Log in to the remote computer on which you want to change your
password.
See the “Connecting to a shared disk or folder on a remote” section ear-
lier in this chapter if you don’t know how to log in to a remote computer.
The Connect to Server dialog appears.
2. Type your username into the Connect to Server dialog if it’s not
already there.
3. Click the Action button in the Connect to Server dialog and choose
Change Password from the pop-up menu.
A sheet for changing your password appears, as shown in Figure 14-20.
The other choice in the Actions pop-up is Options. The sheet that
appears includes several options for encrypting your password as it is
sent over the network.
4. Type your current password in the Old Password field.
5. Type your new password in the New Password and Verify fields.
6. Click OK.
Your password is changed, and you return to the Connect to Server
dialog.
338
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

7. (Optional) Type your new password and click then Connect to log in
to the other Mac.
You can skip this step by clicking the Cancel button in the Connect to
Server dialog if you don’t need to use anything on the remote Mac at this
time. Your password is still changed, and you’ll need to use the new
password the next time you log in to this Mac.
Mark the Add Password to Keychain check box in the Connect to Server
dialog to store your passwords in a single place on the Mac, meaning that
you don’t have to retype them each time you access a Mac or other
remote resource. (Read more about the keychain in Chapter 11.)
Setting up shortcuts to remote 
volumes (and folders)
Here are three ways you can make using remote volumes and folders easier.
The first is to use aliases, the second is to use OS X’s Sidebar, and the third
uses aliases and the Dock. The following sections describe each of these
methods.
Setting up a shortcut using aliases
After you’ve mounted a volume for the first time, you can make it easier to
use in the future by creating an alias for it. The next time you want to use that
volume, just opens the alias, and the Connect dialog appears. You type your
password, and the volume appears (is mounted) on the Desktop. No Connect
to Server; no other dialogs; no muss and no fuss.
Figure 14-20:
Enter your
old and new
passwords.
339
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

You can do this to any folder within the volume, too. It works just the same
with one minor difference: The alias opens that folder, but it also mounts the
volume that contains the folder — and opens it, too. If you find this bother-
some, just close the Home folder’s window. The folder within — the one for
which you made the alias — remains open, and you can continue working
with it.
Setting up a shortcut using the Sidebar
Here’s another easy way to mount a volume: Just click the remote volume’s
icon (or any folder icon within that volume), and then, while it’s selected
(highlighted), choose File➪Add to Sidebar (or press Ô+T) from the Finder’s
menu bar. An alias to the remote volume or folder appears in the Finder
Sidebar and Sidebars of all Open and Save dialogs.
Setting up shortcuts in the Dock (and on the Desktop)
If you use remote folders often, follow these steps to create a folder that sits
on your Dock, ready to call remote computers at your very whim:
1. Log in to each remote volume (or folder) you want included in the
shortcut folder on your Desktop.
2. Create an alias for each remote volume or folder to which you want
easy access.
3. Move the aliases that you created in Step 2 to a new folder on your
Desktop (call it Remote Folders or something equally obvious).
4. Drag the Remote Folders folder onto the Dock.
Here are two easy ways to open any volume or folder in the Remote
Folders folder:
• You can open the Remote Folders folder and double-click any of
the aliases in it.
• You can click and hold (or Control+click) the Remote Folders icon
in the Dock, which causes a menu to pop up that shows all the
aliases in the Remote Folders folder.
Either way, that volume or folder appears on your Desktop almost
instantly.
Connecting to your own computer 
from a remote computer
In this section, I show you several file-sharing tricks you can use on the road.
The first explains how to log in to your home Mac easily from anywhere in
the world by plugging into someone else’s network. The second is a trick I
340
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

call office-on-a-disk, which is a way to take your shortcuts (see the previous
section) with you, even when you use someone else’s Mac. Finally, I give you
a look at how to access your files remotely via modem connection.
These techniques are especially useful for iBook or PowerBook users, or if
you need to connect to your Mac from someplace other than your home or
office network. The only thing you have to remember is that your Mac must
be on and that you need File Sharing turned on as well.
Assume for the moment that you’re on a network, perhaps at a client’s office.
In this section, I show how you would make the connection with a modem.
For example, say you take a plane trip. You bring your PowerBook so you can
work on the plane. When you get to your destination, you want to copy the
files that you’ve been working on to your home Mac to back them up. Well,
you can do that with file sharing — which is easy if you’ve read about file
sharing in the earlier sections of this chapter and understand how to connect
to a remote Mac. (If you aren’t sure how to do that, please reread the previ-
ous sections of this chapter now. If you don’t, the following technique will
only confuse you.)
Because you are the owner of your home Mac, you have full access privileges
to both your Home folder and also to the rest of your Mac, just as you would
if you were working from home. Also, because you own your Mac, you don’t
need to make any changes to file sharing privileges in order to log in and use
your stuff.
You can connect to your home Mac via an Ethernet network or a modem. I’ll
talk about Ethernet first, and then the nifty office-on-a-disk, and finish up with
a rousing look at using a modem (screech optional).
Logging in remotely via Ethernet
Okay, so you’ve arrived at your destination. The first thing to do is plug your
PowerBook’s Ethernet cable into the network and find out what TCP/IP address
info you need to use this network (by asking the PIC, or person in charge; also
sometimes known as the network administrator, IT person, or resident geek).
With those tasks completed, you’re ready to do some sharing.
To connect to your home Mac from a remote computer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Go➪Connect to Server (on your PowerBook or other remote
Mac, of course).
2. Type in the TCP/IP address of your Mac at home in the Address field
and then click the Connect button.
The Connect to Server dialog appears.
341
Chapter 14: Mine! Miiiiine! Sharing Your Mac and Liking It

3. Type your username (it might be the same on the PowerBook as on
your home Mac) and password and then click the Connect button.
The Volume Selection dialog appears. You see your Home folder, your
startup hard drive, and any other disks or partitions that appear on the
Desktop of your home machine.
4. Choose a volume and then click OK.
The volume mounts on your PowerBook Desktop, and you’re in 
business!
Logging in remotely via office-on-a-disk
Here’s an even easier way to use your hard drive while working at someone
else’s Mac. Before leaving your computer, make an alias of your hard drive
and copy it to a USB Flash drive, put it on an iPod, burn it onto a CD-R, or
copy it to your PowerBook’s hard drive. At a remote computer, open the alias
of your hard drive. The Connect dialog appears, and as long as you type the
correct password and your Mac can be found through the network connec-
tion, your hard drive mounts on that Mac’s Desktop. Neat!
This technique is often called office-on-a-disk. If you work in a largish office
and find yourself trying to connect to your hard drive from someone else’s
computer, carry one of these office-on-a-disk, um, disks with you at all times.
And if you’re using a PowerBook, keep the aliases to your Mac (and any
others you use on the road) on the Desktop for quick access. You could also
put them in a folder and drag the folder to the Dock. Then all the aliases are
available in a pop-up menu when you click and hold (or Control+click) the
folder’s Dock icon.
If you have no USB Flash drive or other removable-media disk drive, don’t
despair — you can still use a disk alias. The first time you mount your hard
drive on a remote Mac (see the preceding section, “Logging in remotely via
Ethernet”), make an alias of the mounted drive. Leave it on the Desktop or
some other convenient location, and you can use it to mount the drive 
immediately.
Logging in remotely via a modem
Mac OS X includes Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) software — Internet 
Connect — that enables you to connect to another computer or the 
Internet by modem.
With Internet Connect, you can access your home hard drive from a remote
Mac when you’re at another location. You do need a modem — and you also
need to configure this modem for remote access (which luckily is a pretty
simple process). Because remote access uses the same Accounts and File
Sharing tools as network file sharing, you should probably bone up on file
sharing (in the sections earlier in this chapter) if you haven’t already.
342
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

To use a modem to log in remotely, follow these steps:
1. Choose System Preferences from the Ú menu or click the System
Preferences icon in the Dock.
2. Click the Network icon.
The Network pane appears.
You can consolidate Steps 1 and 2 by choosing Ú➪Location➪Network
Preferences.
3. Choose Internal Modem from the Show pop-up menu, unless you have
an external modem; in that case, choose that option.
If you’ve been using Ethernet rather than a modem, notice that two new
tabs appear after you choose Internal Modem from the menu: the PPP
tab and the Modem tab.
4. Click the PPP tab.
PPP options appear, as shown in Figure 14-21.
5. (Optional) Type a name for this connection in the Service Provider
field.
Doing so gives a name to the connection information you’re creating,
which enables you to reuse it easily later. It’s handy if you need to use
this modem connection again.
Figure 14-21:

tab of the
Network
pane is

343

6. Type your account name (Internet username) in the Account Name
field.
7. Type your password in the Password field.
8. Type the phone number that you want to dial (including any dialing
prefix and area code) into the Telephone Number field.
9. (Optional) Type an alternate phone number, if there is one, in the
Alternate Number field.
10. (Optional) If you want to log in without having to enter your password
each time, select the Save Password check box.
Selecting this check box means that someone with access to your Mac
can log in to your account, so be careful — especially if you’re working
on an iBook or PowerBook.
11. Click the PPP Options button to set preferences for how your connec-
tion is made and maintained.
The PPP Options sheet appears, as shown in Figure 14-22. Of the many
options you find here, I point out a few of the most useful in the follow-
ing list:
• Select the Connect Automatically When Needed check box if you
want your modem to connect to the Internet when you launch your
browser, connect to a remote server, or retrieve e-mail. This check
box must be marked, or your Mac won’t connect to the Internet
automatically when you choose Go➪Connect to Server.
Figure 14-22:

344
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

• Leave the Prompt Every x Minutes to Maintain Connection check
box selected if you’re paying long distance charges or Internet
access charges. If you don’t set this auto-disconnect timer, you
could rack up a lot of toll charges if you forget you’re connected
and online. If you choose this option, set the number of idle min-
utes by clicking within the number box and typing the number 
you want.
• Select the Redial If Busy check box to do just that. You can choose
the number of attempts that your modem will make and how long
it should wait between attempts if it gets a busy signal instead of
connecting.
12. When you’re done setting PPP options, click OK to close the PPP
Options sheet.
13. (Optional) Click the Modem tab in the Network pane.
Your modem should be selected in the Modem pop-up menu. If you’re
having problems connecting, use the menu to find your particular modem
and select it. You won’t need to do much with these settings unless you’re
having a problem connecting with the modem, but you can set little
options here, too. Some options of note are
• Some modems, such as the Apple 56K modems included in most
Macs, are capable of performing some error checking and data
compression. It’s not industrial-strength compression, but it can
speed up data transfer.
• You can tell the modem to wait until it detects a dial tone before
dialing. In less-friendly environs, you have to know to insert
commas into the phone number to get that pause.
• Choose whether to turn your speaker sound off (to rid yourself of
that horrid modem-screech).
• Choose tone or pulse dialing, if you need the latter for some
strange reason.
And that retires the side. Just choose Go➪Connect to Server and log in
to the remote machine. (If you don’t know how, read the “Connecting to
a shared disk or folder on a remote” section earlier in the chapter.)

In This Chapter
 Facing the dreaded Sad Mac
 Dealing with the flashing question mark
 Recovering from startup crashes
A
s a bleeding-edge Mac enthusiast with over 20 years of Mac experience
under my belt, I’ve had more than my share of Mac troubles. Over those
years I’ve developed an arsenal of surefire tips and tricks that I believe can
resolve more than 90 percent of Mac OS X problems without a trip to the
repair shop.
Alas, if your hardware is dead, then, sadly, neither you nor I can do anything
about it because this is now a job for your friendly Mac repairman and your
fat checkbook.
But if your hardware is okay, you have a fighting chance of using the sugges-
tions in this chapter to get your machine up and running.
Dem Ol’ Sad Mac Chimes of Doom Blues
Although you usually see a stylish Apple logo when you turn your computer
on, once in a blue moon you might see the dreaded Sad Mac icon (shown in
the left margin) and hear that melancholy arpeggio in G minor (better known
as the Chimes of Doom), or the sound of breaking glass or a car wreck, or any
of the other horrible sounds that Macs make when they’re dying.
The Sad Mac usually indicates that something very bad has happened to
your Mac; often some hardware component has bitten the dust. But Sad Macs
are rather uncommon — many Mac users go an entire lifetime without seeing
one. If you ever have a Sad Mac experience, don’t despair immediately.
Before you diagnose your Mac as terminally ill, disconnect any external
FireWire and USB devices (everything except your keyboard and mouse), and
try booting from CD-ROM to bring it back to life. If you’ve installed third-party
memory (RAM from a vendor other than Apple), remove all non-Apple RAM
chips and try booting from CD-ROM to bring it back to life.

If you have your OS X installation CD-ROM ready, you can skip to the section
“Booting from CD-ROM” later in this chapter. If you’re not sure about your OS
X installation CD-ROM, see the next section.
The ultimate startup disk: 
The OS X installation CD
I bet you have a copy of the ultimate startup disk right there on your com-
puter table — the installation CD that came with your computer or (if you
purchased a boxed retail copy of Tiger) Install Disk 1.
You see, in addition to the system software that you need to make your Mac
work, all OS X installation disks are bootable and include a working copy of
Disk Utility, which I discuss in the section “Step 1: Run First Aid” section later
in this chapter. 
If you see a flashing question-mark-on-a-folder (top left in Figure 15-1), pro-
hibitory sign (top center), a spinning-disk cursor (top right), or a kernel
panic alert (bottom) that doesn’t go away when you start up your Mac, the
first thing to do is attempt to repair hidden damage to your hard drive with
the Apple Disk Utility program’s First Aid feature. 
Another of Disk Utility’s features lets you verify and repair disk permissions,
which is a handy thing to do if your Mac is telling you that you don’t have the
correct permission to do things that you used to be able to do, such as move
a file or folder into the Applications (or other) folder, or move an icon to the
Trash.
Figure 15-1:
If you see
any of these
things at
startup, it’s
troubleshoot
ing time.
348
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

You get a brass-tacks view of using these utilities throughout the rest of this
chapter.
If you don’t have a bootable CD-ROM, preferably a Mac OS X Install CD-ROM,
you can’t do most of the rest of the stuff in this chapter. So if you don’t have
it handy, go find it now. If you really can’t find one, consider calling Apple or
your Apple dealer to arrange for a replacement — you really shouldn’t be
without it.
Booting from CD-ROM
To boot your Mac from a CD-ROM installation disk, follow these steps:
1. Insert a bootable CD-ROM (the Mac OS X installer CD is a good
choice).
If your Mac uses a tray to hold the CD, make sure that it retracts and
that the disk is in.
If you have a tray-loading CD-ROM drive and it’s closed, you can get it to
open by restarting (or starting up) your Mac while pressing the mouse
button. Continue pressing until the drive tray pops out; then release.
2. Shut down or restart your Mac.
If you shut it down, wait a few seconds and then start it up the usual way.
349
Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Mac OS X
Better safe than Mac-less
The bootable Mac OS X CD-ROM is soooo
important — try to have more than one copy
around. That way, if one gets misplaced, dam-
aged, eaten by the dog, scuffed, scratched, or
otherwise rendered useless, you won’t be out of
luck. I keep the Mac OS X CD in my middle desk
drawer and several other bootable CDs on the
bookshelf. An older version of Mac OS and the
CD that came with your computer are examples
of extra bootable CDs that you might have hang-
ing around. The Mac OS X installation CD is
bootable as well. All these will boot your Mac in
an emergency, which is why they’re so impor-
tant to have handy.
One thing I’d do — if I only had one of these
valuable CDs — is to use Apple’s Disk Utility (in
Applications/Utilities) to create a disk image of
the CD and then burn a copy or two as spares.
Don’t forget to test the burned disks to ensure
that they work and are bootable.

3. Press and hold down the C key immediately and keep it pressed until
your Mac either boots from the CD or doesn’t.
If it boots, you see a Welcome screen; if it doesn’t, you see a flashing
question mark, prohibitory sign, spinning wheel-of-death, anything but
the first screen of the OS X Installer, the login window, or the Finder.
If your Mac doesn’t boot from the CD when you hold down the C key,
hold down the Option key while booting to display the built-in Startup
Manager (Figure 15-2). It displays icons for any bootable disks that it
sees and allows you to select one (including the installation CD).
Click the CD-ROM icon to select it (on the right in Figure 15-2, unselected),
and then click the right-arrow button to boot from it.
This technique is quite useful if your usual boot disk is damaged or having an
identity crisis during startup.
If you can boot from CD-ROM . . .
If you see the Mac OS startup (Welcome) screen when you boot (start up)
from your CD-ROM, hope flickers for your Mac. The fact that you can boot
from another disk (a CD-ROM in this case) indicates that the problem lies in
one of two places: your hard drive and/or Mac OS X itself. Whatever the
tangle, it will probably respond to one of the techniques I discuss throughout
the rest of this chapter.
So your Mac boots from the installation CD-ROM, but you still have this little
problem: You prefer that your Mac boot from your (much faster) hard drive
than the system software CD-ROM. Not to worry. All you need to do is rein-
stall Mac OS X (as described in the Appendix at the end of this book).
If you can’t boot from CD-ROM . . .
If the techniques in this chapter don’t correct your Mac problem or you still
see the Sad Mac icon when you start up with the CD, your Mac is probably
toasted and needs to go in for repairs (usually to an Apple dealer).

Before you drag it down to the shop, however, try calling 1-800-SOS-APPL, the
Apple Tech Support hotline. The service representatives there may be able to
suggest something else that you can try. If your Mac is still under warranty,
it’s even free.
Another thing you might consider is contacting your local Macintosh user
group. You can find a group of Mac users near you by visiting Apple’s User
Group Web pages at www.apple.com/usergroups.
Or check out my new company, Doctor Mac Direct, at www.doctormac
direct.com or call us toll-free at 877-DrMac4U. Our team of Mac experts
does nothing but provide technical help and training to Mac users, via 
telephone, e-mail, and/or unique Internet-enabled remote control software, 
in real time and at reasonable prices.
If you get the Sad Mac immediately after installing random-access memory
(RAM) — and this is quite common — double-check that the RAM is properly
seated in its sockets. Don’t forget to power-down your Mac first.
Follow the installation instructions that came with the RAM chips or the ones
in the booklet that came with your Mac. But even if they don’t say to, you
should get rid of the spark, either by using an anti-static strap (available from
most RAM sellers) or by touching an appropriate surface (such as the power-
supply case inside your Mac) before you handle RAM chips.
If problems occur immediately after installing RAM (or any new hardware, for
that matter), remove and reinsert the RAM chips to make sure that they’re
seated properly. If you still have problems, remove the RAM temporarily and
see whether the problem still exists.
Question Mark and the Mysterians
When you turn on your Mac, the first thing that it does (after the hardware
tests) is to check for a startup disk with Mac OS 9 or X on it. If your system
doesn’t find such a disk on your internal hard drive, it begins looking else-
where — on a FireWire or Universal Serial Bus (USB) disk or on a CD or DVD.
If you have more than one startup disk attached to your Mac, as many users
do, you can choose which one your Mac boots from in the Startup Disk
System Preference pane. (See Chapter 13 for details.)
At this point, your Mac usually finds your hard drive, which contains your
operating system, and the startup process continues on its merry way with
the happy Mac and all the rest. If your Mac can’t find your hard drive (or
doesn’t find on it what it needs to boot OS X), you encounter a flashing-
question-mark icon or the prohibitory sign.
351
Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Mac OS X

Don’t go cryin’ 96 Tears. Those icons just mean that your Mac can’t find a
startup disk — a hard drive, or bootable CD-or-DVD-ROM disk with valid
system software (either Mac OS X or a previous version supported by your
particular Mac).
Think of the flashing question mark or prohibitory sign as your Mac’s way of
saying, “Please provide me with a startup disk.”
If Apple can figure out a way to put a flashing question mark or prohibitory
sign on the screen, why the heck can’t the software engineers find a way to
put the words Please insert a startup disk on the screen as well? 
The curtness of these icons is one of my pet peeves about the Macintosh. 
I know — you’re clever and smart (but of course — you’re reading Mac OS X
Tiger For Dummies, aren’t you?), so you know that a flashing question mark
or prohibitory sign means you should insert a startup disk. But what about
everyone else?
If you encounter any of these warning icons, go through the steps I outline
next in this chapter. There are different options you can try, such as using
Disk Tools and First Aid, zapping the parameter RAM (PRAM), and perform-
ing a Safe Boot. Try them in the order listed, starting with Step 1. Then, if 
one doesn’t work, move on to the next.
Step 1: Run First Aid
In most cases, after you’ve booted successfully from the OS X CD, the first
logical troubleshooting step is to use the First Aid option in the Disk Utility
application.
Every drive has several strangely named components such as B-trees, extent
files, catalog files, and other creatively named invisible files. They are all
involved in managing the data on your drives. Disk Utility’s First Aid feature
checks all those files and repairs the damaged ones.
Here’s how to make First Aid do its thing:
1. Boot from your Mac OS X CD by inserting the CD and restarting your
Mac while holding down the C key.
The OS X Installer appears on your screen.
2. Choose Installer➪Open Disk Utility to launch the Disk Utility applica-
tion that’s on the CD.
3. When the Disk Utility window appears, click the First Aid tab to select
that function of Disk Utility.
352
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

4. Click the icon for your boot hard drive at the left of the Disk Utility
window (Tiger in Figure 15-3).
Your boot drive is the one with OS X and your Home folder on it. I call
this one Tiger.
5. Click the Repair Disk button.
Your Mac whirs and hums for a few minutes, and the results window
tells you what’s going on. Ultimately, First Aid tells you (you hope) that
the drive has been repaired and is now okay, as shown in Figure 15-4. If
so, go back to work.
6. Quit Disk Utility by choosing Disk Utility➪Quit Disk Utility or by press-
ing Ô+Q.
7. Reboot without holding the C key down.
If First Aid finds damage that it can’t fix, a commercial disk-recovery tool,
such as Alsoft’s DiskWarrior or MicroMat’s TechTool Pro, may be able to
repair the damage. And even if First Aid gave you a clean bill of health, you
may want to run DiskWarrior anyway just to have a second opinion. Make
sure you’re running a current version; older versions were not Mac OS X-
compatible.
Figure 15-3:

353
Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Mac OS X

DiskWarrior has resurrected more dead and dying hard drives for me than
every other disk-repair utility I’ve ever tried, or all of them combined. If
you’re only going to buy one utility, make sure it’s DiskWarrior. It’s almost 
like magic.
If everything checks out with First Aid, eject the CD and try to boot from your
hard drive again. If you still get the flashing question mark or prohibitory
sign, proceed to the next section to try a little dance called zapping the
PRAM (coming up in Step 3).
Step 2: Safe Boot into Safe Mode
Booting your Mac in Safe Mode may help you resolve your startup issue by
not loading non-essential (and non-OS X) software at boot time. You do it by
holding down the Shift key during startup, as shown in Figure 15-5.
Keep holding down Shift until the Finder loads completely. If your Mac is set
up so you don’t have to log in, keep pressing the Shift key until the Finder
loads completely. If you do log in to your Mac, type your password as usual,
but before clicking the Log In button, press the Shift key again and hold it
until the Finder loads completely.

Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

You’ll know you held the Shift key long enough if your Startup Items don’t
load (assuming you have Startup Items; you can create them in the Accounts
System Preference pane, although some programs create them for you).
Booting in Safe Mode does three things to help you with troubleshooting:
 It forces a directory check of the startup (boot) volume.
 It loads only required kernel extensions (some of the items in /System/
Library/Extensions). 
 It runs only Apple-installed startup items (some of the items in /Library/
Startup Items and /System/Library/Startup items). Note that the startup
items in the Library folders are different from the Startup Items in the
Accounts System Preference pane.
Taken together, normally these changes can work around issues caused by
software or directory damage on the startup volume.
Some features do not work in Safe Mode. Among them are DVD Player, captur-
ing video (in iMovie or other video-editing software), using an AirPort card,
using some audio input or output devices, or using an internal or external
USB modem. Use Safe Mode only if you need to troubleshoot a startup issue.
If your Mac boots in Safe Mode, you may be able to determine what is causing
it — usually a damaged Preference file (in Home/Library/Preferences) or one
of your Startup Items (in the Accounts System Preference pane).
If your Mac still has problems, try Step 3.

Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Mac OS X

Step 3: Zapping the PRAM
Sometimes your parameter RAM (PRAM) becomes scrambled and needs to be
reset. PRAM is a small piece of memory that’s not erased or forgotten when
you shut down; it keeps track of things such as printer selection, sound level,
and monitor settings.
PRAM stores these settings:
 Time zone setting
 Startup volume choice
 Speaker volume
 Recent kernel panic information, if any
 DVD region setting
To reset (often called “zapping”) your PRAM, restart your Mac and press
Ô+Option+P+R (that’s four keys — good luck; it’s okay to use your nose) until
your Mac restarts itself. It’s kind of like a hiccup. You may see the flashing
question mark or spinning-disk cursor for a minute or two while your Mac
thinks about it — then the icon disappears, and your Mac chimes again and
restarts. Most power users believe you should zap it more than once, letting
it chime two, three, or even four times before releasing the keys and allowing
the startup process to proceed.
Now restart your Mac without holding down any keys.
If the PRAM zap didn’t fix your Mac, move on to Step 4.
Remember that your chosen startup disk, time zone, and sound volume are
reset to their default values when you zap your PRAM. So after zapping, open
the System Preferences application to reselect your usual boot disk and time
zone, and set the sound volume the way you like it.
Unlike prior versions of the Mac OS, Mac OS X does not store display or net-
work settings in PRAM. If you are having problems with video or networking,
resetting PRAM will not help.
Step 4: Reinstalling OS X
I present the procedure to reinstall the system software last in this section
because it takes the longest and is the biggest hassle. I detail this procedure
at great length in the Appendix.
356
Part IV: Networking and Troubleshooting 

Read the Appendix and follow the instructions. If you’re still unsuccessful
after that point, you’ll have no choice but to consider Step 5 . . .
Step 5: Take your Mac in for repair
If none of my suggestions work for you and you’re still seeing anything you
shouldn’t when you start up your Mac, you have big trouble.
You could have any one of the following problems:
 Your hard drive is dead.
 You have some other type of hardware failure.
 All your startup disks and your system-software CDs are defective
(unlikely).
The bottom line: If you still can’t start up normally after trying all the cures I
list in this chapter, you almost certainly need to have your Mac serviced by a
qualified technician.
If You Crash at Startup
Startup crashes are another bad thing that can happen to your Mac. These
crashes can be more of a hassle to resolve than flashing-question-mark prob-
lems, but are rarely fatal.
You know that a crash has happened when you see a System Error dialog, a
frozen cursor, a frozen screen, or any other disabling event. A startup crash
happens when your system shows a crash symptom any time between flick-
ing the power key or switch (or restarting) and having full use of the Desktop.
Try all the steps in the previous section before you panic. The easiest way to
fix startup crashes (in most cases) is to just reinstall OS X from the CD using
the Archive and Install option. I detail this procedure at great length in the
Appendix. Read the Appendix and follow the instructions. If you’re still
unsuccessful after that point, come back and reread the “Step 5: Take your
Mac in for repair” section.

Ten (Or So) Ways to Speed 
Up Your Mac Experience
T
his chapter is for speed demons only. At some time in their Mac lives,
most users have wished that their machines would work faster — even
those with Power Macintosh models or iMac G5s. I can’t help you make your
processor faster, but here I cover some ways to make your Mac at least seem
faster, and most of these tips won’t cost you a red cent.
Use Those Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts (see Table 16-1 for a way-groovy list of the more useful
ones) can make navigating your Mac a much faster experience compared to
constantly using the mouse, offering these benefits:
 By using keyboard shortcuts, your hands stay focused on the keyboard,
reducing the amount of time that you remove your hand from the key-
board to fiddle with the mouse.
 If you memorize keyboard shortcuts with your head, your fingers will
memorize them, too.
 The more keyboard shortcuts you use, the faster you can do what you’re
doing.
Trust me when I say that learning the keyboard shortcuts for commands that
you use often will save you a ton of time and effort.
Make a list of keyboard shortcuts and tape it to your monitor or somewhere
where you’ll see it all the time when using your Mac. (Heck, make a photo-
copy of Table 16-1!)

Pastes the contents of the Clipboard at the
spot where your cursor is. 
Ô+F
Find
Brings up a Find window in the Finder;
brings up a Find dialog in most programs.
Ô+A
Select All
Selects the entire contents of the active
window in many programs, including the
Finder.
Ô+Z
Undo
Undoes the last thing you did in many pro-
grams, including the Finder.
Ô+Shift+?
Help
Brings up the Mac Help window in the
Finder; usually the shortcut to summon Help
in other programs.
Ô+H
Hide
(Usually) Hides the current application. Use
the Application menu (the one that reads
Finder when you’re in the Finder) to Show All
applications again. Some applications, such
as BBEdit and Illustrator, have long used
Ô+H for something else — and hiding the
application would really confuse their long-
time users (so they don’t use this shortcut).

Learn to Type Better
One way to make your Mac seem faster is to make your fingers move faster.
The quicker you finish a task, the quicker you’re on to something else.
Keyboard shortcuts are nifty tools, and improving your typing speed and
accuracy will save you time. Plus, you’ll get stuff done faster if you’re not
always looking down at the keyboard or up at the screen when you type.
You’ll also find that as your typing skills improve, you spend less time cor-
recting errors or editing your work.

Chapter 16: Ten (Or So) Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience
The Mac is not a typewriter
The Macintosh is more of a typesetting machine
than a typewriter. So when you use a Macintosh,
you should follow the rules of good typography,
not the rules of good typewriting. If you want
your documents to look truly professional, you
need to understand the difference between inch
and foot marks (" and ') and typographer’s quota-
tion marks “ and “ or ‘ and ‘, in addition to putting
single spaces after punctuation. You also need
to know where and how to use a hyphen (-), an
en dash (–), and an em dash (—).
For more on making your documents look more
elegant and professional, get a hold of an excel-
lent book by Mac-goddess Robin Williams, The
Mac Is Not a Typewriter (published by Peachpit
Press).

The speed and accuracy that you gain has an added bonus: When you’re a
decent touch typist, your fingers fly even faster when you use those nifty key-
board shortcuts. (I list a gaggle of these in the preceding section, in Table 16-1.)
Resolution: It’s Not Just 
for New Year’s Anymore
A setting that you can change to potentially improve your Mac’s performance
is the resolution of your monitor. Most modern monitors and video cards (or
onboard video circuitry, depending on which Mac model you use) can display
multiple degrees of screen resolution. You change your monitor’s display reso-
lution in the same place where you choose the number of colors you want: 
the Display System Preference pane. Click your resolution choice from the
Resolutions list on the left side of this tab.
In Displays System Preferences, check the Show Displays in Menu Bar box to
change resolutions and color depth without opening System Preferences. You
can then select your resolution from the Displays menu that appears near the
right end of your menu bar, as shown in Figure 16-1.
Here’s the deal on display resolution: The smaller the numbers that you use
for your monitor’s resolution, the faster your screen refreshes. For a com-
puter monitor, resolution is expressed as a dimension-type set of numbers
(number x number). The first number is the number of pixels (color dots) that
run horizontally, and the second number is the number of lines running verti-
cally. Fewer pixels refresh faster. Therefore, a resolution of 640 x 480 updates
itself faster than a resolution of 832 x 624; 832 x 624 updates faster than 1,024
x 768; and so forth.
Figure 16-1:
Use the
handy
Displays
menu to

resolutions
right from
the menu

364
Part V: The Part of Tens 

This isn’t always true if you have an LCD (flat-panel) monitor or a PowerBook.
In that case, the native resolution is usually faster. Which is the native resolu-
tion? Depends on the monitor. For the Apple Studio Display 15-inch, and most
older iBooks and PowerBooks, it’s 1024 x 768. For newer PowerBooks, it’s usu-
ally 1280 x 854. And for my 22-inch Apple Cinema Display, it’s 1600 x 1024.
Check the documentation that came with your display to determine what 
resolution(s) the vendor recommends.
On the other hand, the speed difference between resolutions these days is
relatively minimal. In fact, I can almost never tell the difference between one
and the other. Furthermore, because you can see more onscreen at higher
resolutions, a higher resolution reduces the amount of scrolling that you
have to do and lets you have more open windows on the screen. Therefore,
you could say that higher resolutions can speed up your Mac as well.
Bottom line: Choose a resolution based on your preference, rather than one
you think might be faster. That said, if your Mac seems slow at a resolution
setting of 1,600 x 1024, try a lower resolution and see whether it feels faster.
Although you can use Mac OS X at resolutions of less than 1024 x 768, Apple
has designed the OS X windows and dialogs on the assumption that your res-
olution will be at least 1024 x 768. So if you choose a lower resolution, some
interface elements may be drawn partially or completely off-screen. Just keep
that in mind if you choose a resolution below 1024 x 768.
A Mac with a View — 
and Preferences, Too
The type of icon display and the Desktop background that you choose affect
how quickly your screen updates in the Finder. You can set and change these
choices in the View Options windows. From the Finder, choose View➪Show
View Options (or use the keyboard shortcut Ô+J).
The View Options window, like our old friend the contextual menu, is . . . 
well . . . contextual. Depending on what’s active when you choose it from 
the View menu, you see one of four similar versions (shown in Figure 16-2) —
from left to right: folders in Icon view, folders in List view, folders in Column
view, and the Desktop.
The All Windows and This Window Only radio buttons in the View Options
window display identical options. You choose the All Windows radio button
to set the default appearance for all your Finder windows, and you choose
the This Window Only radio button to set up just the current window. These
buttons appear only for the Icon and List view windows; Column windows are
one-size-fits-all.
365
Chapter 16: Ten (Or So) Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience

When bigger isn’t better
The smaller the icon, the faster the screen updates. In the Icon view of the
View Options windows, moving the Icon Size slider to the left makes icons
smaller (faster); moving it to the right makes them bigger (slower). In List
view, select one of the two Icon Size radio buttons to choose smaller (faster)
or larger (slower) icons. The difference is greater if you have an older Mac.
Calculated moves
I recommend that you deactivate Calculate All Sizes (that is, deselect, or
clear, its check box). If you activate this option, the Finder calculates the size
of every folder of every open window in List view and displays that number
in the Size column. At least to me, the screen feels as if it redraws faster with
this feature turned off. This feature is offered only for windows using the List
view.
The Finder is kind of smart about the Calculate All Sizes option. If you try to
do anything in the Finder while folder sizes are calculating — say, make a
menu selection, open an icon, or move a window, for example — the Finder
interrupts the calculation so you can complete your task before it resumes
calculating. So (in theory) you should never notice a delay when Calculate 
All Sizes is selected.
Try the Calculate All Sizes option both on and off. I don’t know about you, 
but I find any noticeable delay unacceptable, and I notice a delay when this
option is turned on, even on fast Macs. Maybe this feature is just annoying
and not actually slowing things down, but I can’t stand having it on. If you
want to know how big a folder is, just click it and choose File➪Get Info (or
use the keyboard shortcut, Ô+I).

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Getting ahead-er and other stuff
The Show Columns check boxes in the View Options window for List view —
Date Modified, Date Created, Size, Kind, Version, and Comments — have a
slight impact on screen update speed when you open a Finder window in List
view. The Finder has to draw everything that you select here: With fewer
items checked, the Finder updates windows faster.
The effect of these items on screen updating is pretty small, so your choice
should be made according to the specific information you want to see in
Finder windows, not on whether choosing them slows down your Mac. Play
around with these options if you like, but unless your Mac is very slow, you
probably won’t notice much (or any) difference between on and off.
Get a New, Faster Model 
or Upgrade Yours
Apple keeps putting out faster and faster Macs at lower and lower prices. But
many Mac models still ship with a paltry 256MB of RAM, not enough to run
Tiger at its best.
Check out the latest iMacs and eMacs — they’re an excellent value. Or, if you
crave portability, iBooks and PowerBooks are rocking good computers and
have never sold for less. You might even consider a used Mac that’s faster
than yours. The big-time honcho of auction Web sites, eBay (www.ebay.com),
has hundreds of used Macs up for auction at any given time. Shopping on
eBay might just get you a better Mac at an outstanding price. Give it a try!
Or, for a lot of bang for the buck, upgrade your Mac’s RAM. Get an additional
512MB, 768MB, heck, even a gigabyte or more of the stuff — you can never
have too much. Your Mac will run better with at least 512MB of RAM, which
will cost you well under $100 in most cases and can be installed by anyone.
Yes, anyone — the instructions are right there in your User Guide booklet 
or you can find them at Apple’s Technical Support pages (www.apple.com/
support/; search for RAM upgrade and your Mac model). 
Unless, that is, you own a Mac mini. The Mac mini, you see, is exceedingly 
difficult to open without the proper and very specialized tool (a putty knife).
And Apple frowns upon mere mortals applying such a tool to said Mac mini.
Therefore, those of you with a Mac mini might want to opt for the services of
an authorized, certified Mac cracker-opener to perform your RAM upgrade.

Chapter 16: Ten (Or So) Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience

Get an Accelerator
An accelerator is a card that replaces the processor (CPU) in your Mac with a
faster one. Even if you have a G4 in your Mac already, you might be able to
upgrade to a faster one.
But before you plunk down the cash for an upgrade, be sure that it’s 
compatible with Mac OS X. Some upgrades work only with older versions 
of Mac OS — and those won’t help you.
Visit www.macworld.com for information on the various upgrade options
available and how they compare with each other. Upgrades start at a few
hundred dollars and go up to more than a thousand clams. The older your
Mac, the more bang you’ll get for your G4 upgrade buck.
Get an Accelerated Graphics Card
An accelerated graphics card is designed to speed up one thing: the screen
update rate. Accelerated graphics cards blast pixels onto your screen at
amazing speeds. They’re extremely popular with graphic-arts professionals
who would otherwise suffer slower screen redraws while working with 24-bit
graphics. Most accelerators are also awesome for playing 3-D games. And
because OS X’s Quartz Extreme imaging architecture hands off part of its load
to the processor on an accelerated graphics card, it might even make other
tasks faster because it does some of the work that your Mac’s main processor
(CPU) used to do.
You can use a graphics accelerator only if your Mac has a slot for it; that’s
where you install one. Currently, you need a PowerMac G4 or G5 to use a
graphics accelerator with OS X.
Visit www.macworld.com for information on the various graphics cards avail-
able and how they compare with each other. Cards start at around a hundred
dollars and go up from there. And remember, the older your Mac, the more of
a performance boost you’ll see for your graphics-card-upgrade buck.
Get a New Hard Drive
Depending on how old your Mac is, a faster hard drive could provide a sub-
stantial speedup. If you have a relatively new Mac — any Mac with a G4 or G5
368
Part V: The Part of Tens 

processor — the internal hard drive that came with it is pretty fast already.
Unless you also need more storage space, a new hard drive may not be the
best way to spend your bucks. On the other hand, if you have an older G3
model, a faster (and larger) FireWire or USB 2 hard drive could be just the
ticket.
Add Storage with FireWire 
or USB 2 Drives
FireWire and USB 2 are the fastest busses (or data pathways) you can use for
external devices on most Macs.
FireWire, the current state of the art in connecting devices that need fast
transfer speeds, is used to connect devices that require high-speed communi-
cation with your Mac — hard drives, CD burners, scanners, camcorders, and
such.
FireWire is the fastest, easiest way to add storage to Macs that include it. 
If you must use USB, make sure you get USB 2 and not plain old USB
(Universal Serial Bus). Plain ol’ USB will work, of course, but it’s as slow as
molasses by comparison. (Plain ol’ USB runs at about three percent of the
speed of FireWire.)
USB 2, on the other hand, transfers data at roughly the same speed as
FireWire. So if you have the need for speed, be sure you opt for a FireWire or
USB 2 hard drive model and not a plain ol’ USB model. 
The good news is that whatever you choose, you can usually just plug it in
and start using it. Ninety-nine percent of the time, there’s nothing more to it!

Chapter 17
Ten (Or So) Ways to Make Your
Mac Better by Throwing 
Money at It
T
his is one of my favorite chapters. As you’ve probably figured out by now,
I love souping up my Macs. I live to find ways of working smarter, saving
time or hand motion, and coaxing my Mac to do more work in less time. So it
gives me great pleasure to share in this chapter my personal top ten things
that you can buy for your Mac to tweak it and make it faster, easier to use,
and (I hope) more fun.
The items listed in this chapter are things I have, use every day, love dearly,
and would (and probably will!) buy again.
RAM
RAM, or random-access memory, is your computer’s primary working
memory. The more you have, the smoother your Mac runs — period. If you
have anything less than 512MB in your Mac, you’ll like your Mac a lot better if
you upgrade to 512MB or more. If you like to do a few things at once, more
megabytes of RAM will make you a happier camper. (For what it’s worth, RAM
has never been cheaper than it is today — it’s worth every penny.)
It’s also easy as pie to install RAM into most Macs made this decade. Chances
are the manual that came with your Mac includes step-by-step instructions
simple enough for a nine-year-old to follow. I know because I once asked my
(then) nine-year-old son do it. Which he did — and with no trouble, either.

Backup Software
The only two kinds of Mac users are those who have lost data and those who
are going to. If your work means anything to you, get something that helps
automate the task of backing up your files. Retrospect Desktop, Workgroup,
or Server, all from Dantz Development (www.dantz.com), are the names to
trust. And please, please read Chapter 8, which is titled (appropriately) “Back
Up Now or Regret It Later.” It may well be the most important chapter in this
book.
A Better Monitor (or a Second One)
If you have a tiny monitor, get a bigger one. With a larger monitor, you spend
less time scrolling and rearranging windows and more of your time getting
actual work done — which is a good thing, right? For example, my main 
computer setup includes two monitors: a 22-inch Apple Cinema flat-panel LCD
display, and an old fashioned CRT display, a 24-inch NEC MultiSync. It’s an
awesome setup — one that I highly recommend. With two monitors, you can
have the menu bar and Finder windows on the first monitor, and document(s)
that you’re working on displayed on the second monitor. Or, when using a 
program like Photoshop (which has lots of floating palettes), you can put the
palettes on one monitor and a document that you’re working on can be dis-
played on the big one. And so on.
Flat-panel LCD displays, such as the Apple Studio and Cinema Displays, have
come down dramatically in price over the past year. In my humble opinion,
LCD displays are brighter and easier on the eyes than traditional CRT (glass
picture tube) monitors. Apple must agree, because they no longer sell CRTs
other than the ones built into eMacs. If you can afford one, that’s what you
really want. Alas, owners of older iMacs, as well as most iBook owners, are
out of luck on this tip — it’s not possible to add a second monitor to those
models. If you’ve got a more recent iMac that includes a video port, however,
you can get a bigger second monitor.
A Fast Internet Connection
High-bandwidth (that is, fast-Internet-access) connections just rock. By
adding a high-speed Internet connection, such as digital subscriber line (DSL)
or cable modem, your capacity to communicate electronically will increase
tenfold. With this add-on, you can join an online service, surf the Internet,
372
Part V: The Part of Tens 

e-mail your friends, and much, much more, at speeds ten or more times faster
than a 56Kbps modem. Web pages that once took minutes to load appear
onscreen almost instantly. And it’s fast enough that you can listen to stream-
ing audio or watch streaming video without (many) hiccups. If you can afford
cable/DSL ($25-$50/month in most places) and are in an area where you can
get cable modem or DSL (not all places can, yet), it will change the way you
view the Internet.
Additional Hard/Removable/Optical
Drive(s)
Apple stopped including floppy disk drives with new Macs long ago. So now
the only ways you can load new files (programs, documents, games, or what-
ever) onto your Mac are by copying files from some other kind of removable
medium (such as a Zip drive, CD, or DVD, as described in Chapter 7), or by
downloading from the Internet.
If you want to back up your Mac or hand your buddy a disk with files on it,
you’ll need some kind of external drive that uses removable media. 
The most common is a CD-R (recordable CD-ROM) drive — or a CD-RW drive
(with unlimited writing capabilities), like those built into almost every Mac,
which let you create CDs that contain files, music, or both! Both kinds of
drives let you burn CDs (CD-RWs just let you burn ’em again and again).
An even better choice (if you have the dough) is an Apple SuperDrive, which
not only burns CD and CD-RW discs, but also lets you burn DVDs with 4.7GB
of data (or video) each. If you don’t already have a burner, SuperDrive’s the
way to go; if you’re getting a new Mac soon, get one with a SuperDrive — you
won’t regret it. 
If you have a relatively new Mac, you may have a built-in CD-RW, or SuperDrive
drive. If you do (or if you get an external one), for goodness sake — use it to
back up your stuff!
Games
Gaming on the Mac has never been better, and the game developers are get-
ting better and better at coaxing even more performance out of OS X.
373
Chapter 17: Ten (Or So) Ways to Make Your Mac Better

Some of the games I love include Halo, Unreal Tournament 2004, and every
pinball game LittleWing (www.littlewingpinball.com/) has ever created.
Try one — you’ll be amazed at how far computer gaming has come.
Multimedia Titles
Many great games, references, and educational titles come on CD-ROM or
DVD-ROM these days. My favorite is World Book, which makes use of many
Mac features to deliver an encyclopedia that’s both authoritative and fun to
use. You’ll love it and so will your kids. Remember, your Mac is more than
just a computer — it’s a full-blown multimedia player. Enjoy it.
Don’t forget that most Macs can also play video DVDs like those you rent at
Blockbuster Video or NetFlix. . . .
Some Big Honking Speakers 
with a Subwoofer
Face it: Most Macs have crummy speakers (or worse, only one crummy
speaker). With a decent set of speakers, games are more fun, music sounds
like music instead of AM radio, and the voiceovers in your multimedia titles
suddenly become intelligible. If you’re into sound, you’ll enjoy your Mac much
more if you add a set of window-rattling speakers, preferably one with a mas-
sive subwoofer to provide that booming bass that sound lovers crave. So
crank it up! I’m partial to RSL Digital Fidelity One (www.rslspeakers.com),
which gives you killer sound for well under $100, but any good speakers kick
the stuffing out of the speakers built-into any Mac.
If you have a DVD-ROM drive, a killer set of speakers makes watching movies
on your Mac a zillion times better.
A New Mouse and/or Keyboard
If you’re still using that hockey-puck mouse that came with your iMac, G3, or
G4, do yourself a favor and beat it to death with a hammer. Then buy a real
mouse. You’ll be so much happier if you upgrade to a mouse that’s easier to
move around and maybe even has two or more buttons or a scroll wheel.
374
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You’ll be amazed at how much easier it is to work with a mouse that fits your
hand. OS X knows about multi-button mice and scroll wheels. With a two-
button mouse, you no longer have to hold down the Control key while click-
ing to display a contextual menu — just click with the right-hand button.
Also, consider ditching that silly Chiclet keyboard if you’re stuck with one
(you know, those curved, tiny-keyed annoyances that first came with iMacs
and that Apple continued to foist on users for many years). Third-party Mac
keyboards on the market today are also a huge improvement over what prob-
ably came with your Mac — and the new Apple Pro keyboard is an excellent
product.
I’m partial to so-called ergonomic keyboards, which I find more comfortable
for prolonged writing sessions. I also think I type faster with this kind of key-
board. My current axe is a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro. Even though it’s a
Windows keyboard and the modifier keys are mislabeled (the Command key
says Alt and the Option key has a Windows logo on it), Microsoft offers excel-
lent Mac drivers for OS X. Although this particular model has been discontin-
ued, sadly, Microsoft offers other ergonomic keyboards in the Natural line of
products. Shop around to find one that works for you.
Look into the clear Apple Pro keyboard and Pro Mouse if they didn’t come
with your Mac, or their wireless Bluetooth keyboard and mouse Both are cool
and have decent tactile response (but still only one button on the mice —
phooey).
A PowerBook or an iBook
You need a laptop because one Mac is never enough. With a portable Mac, you
can go anywhere and continue to compute. And both iBooks and PowerBooks
come with Apple’s AirPort wireless networking, so you can surf the Net, print,
and share files from the couch or pool, or the Airport (the kind with planes
and a small “p”) or Starbucks for that matter.
A New Mac
If you have any money left, consider upgrading to a newer, faster Mac. They’ve
never been faster, cheaper, or better equipped; if yours is getting a bit long at
the tooth, consider a newer, faster model. The iMac G5, for example, delivers a
ton of bang for the buck.

Chapter 17: Ten (Or So) Ways to Make Your Mac Better

Timing can be everything when shopping for a new Mac. Historically, new
models are announced at Macworld Expo in January (in San Francisco) and at
the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference in the summer (in San Francisco).
So it’s usually a bad idea to buy a new Mac in December or June because
chances are good that what you buy will be discontinued in a month or 
two. On the other hand, Apple occasionally lowers prices the month before
Macworld Expos to clear out old inventory before introducing new models.
Keeping that in mind, my advice is to wait until after a Macworld Expo to
choose your new Mac. But if a December or June deal is so good you can’t
pass it up, go for it. Bear in mind, however, that the model you’re buying might
be discontinued shortly and replaced with a faster, better model at around the
same price (especially if you’d have to upgrade last year’s model).
One great truth of computer shopping is that no matter when you hop on the
highway, a faster and less expensive ride will be along pretty soon. You just
have to realize that if you wait for the ultimate machine at the ultimate price,
you’re never going to have a computer or get anything done with it.
Caveat emptor.

Ten (Or So) Great Web 
Sites for Mac Freaks
A
s much as I would love to think that this book tells you everything you
need to know about using your Mac, I know better. You have a lot more
to discover about using your Mac, and new tools and products come out
almost daily.
The best way to gather more information than you could ever possibly soak
up about all things Macintosh is to hop onto the Web. There you’ll find news,
freeware and shareware software to download, troubleshooting sites, tons of
news and information about your new favorite OS, and lots of places to shop.
So make sure that you read Chapter 9 to get set up for the Internet — because
this chapter is all about finding cool stuff on the Web to help you use your
Mac better (while having lots of fun).
The sites in this chapter are the best, most chock-full-o’-stuff places on the
Web for Mac users. By the time you finish checking out these ten Web sites,
you’ll know so much about your Mac and Mac OS X that you’ll feel like your
brain is in danger of exploding. On the other hand, you may just feel a whole
lot smarter. Happy surfing!
MacFixIt: www.macfixit.com
Frequent Macworld contributor and consultant Ted Landau put together an
excellent troubleshooting site to help users solve common problems and keep
current on compatibility issues with new system software and third-party
products. 
Alas, Ted has taken a less active role in the site of late, and there is now a sur-
charge to search the archives. This site isn’t quite as useful as it once was if
you don’t purchase a Pro membership (currently $25 a year). But even without
paying, it’s worth checking this site when you have any problem with your Mac.
Chances are MacFixIt has a solution.

But I encourage you to go Pro if you can afford the $2 a month. It’s worth more
than that to have unlimited access to MacFixIt’s extensive troubleshooting
archives and special reports.
Don’t tell the MacFixIt gang, but I’d consider it a bargain at twice the price.
VersionTracker.com: www.versiontracker.com
For free or shareware stuff, try VersionTracker. It’s one of the best sites to
search for software — for any version of Mac OS — by keyword. And it’s terrific
for getting the latest version of any kind of software: commercial, shareware,
and/or freeware. It’s a virtual treasure trove of software and updates, and is
worth visiting even when you aren’t looking for anything in particular. So check
it out and download some useful utilities or games or something. I love this
site and visit daily.
MacInTouch: www.macintouch.com
For the latest in Mac news, updated every single day, check out MacInTouch.

newshounds, this site keeps you on the bleeding edge of Mac news, including
software updates, virus alerts, and Apple happenings. I consider this site
essential to keeping up with Mac OS X.
MacMinute: www.macminute.com
Here’s another great source of up-to-the-minute Macintosh news. It’s a great
site, updated many times a day with lots of useful stories, links, and other
Mac info.
Apple Knowledge Base: www.apple.com/support
Do you have a technical question about any version of Mac OS or any Apple
product — including OS X? March your question right over to the Knowledge
Base, Apple’s searchable archives of tech notes, software update information,
and documentation. The Knowledge Base is especially useful if you need info
about your old Mac — Apple archives all its info here. Choose from a preset
list of topics or products and type a keyword to research. You’re rewarded with
a list of helpful documents. Click any one of these entries (they’re all links)
to take you right to the info you seek. The site even has tools that can help
narrow your search.
The Mac OS X Home Page: www.apple.com/macosx

ramseeker: www.macseek.com
One of the best ways to make your Mac better is to buy more random-access
memory (RAM). RAM is the readily available memory that your computer uses;
the more you have, the smoother programs run. Although Mac OS X may run
on a Mac with only 128 MB of RAM, officially Tiger requires 256MB and works
even better and faster with more than that — at least 512MB in my opinion.
As cheap as RAM is, the price that you pay for it can vary quite a lot. The best
way I know to get the lowdown on RAM prices is using the ramseeker feature
of this site, which organizes memory prices by Mac type.
Outpost.com: www.outpost.com
Recently taken over by Fry’s (the great electronics retailer), Outpost.com is
all about buying stuff — and what big kid doesn’t love his toys? Here you can
find lots and lots and lots of Mac products, including Apple CPUs, memory,
drives, printers, scanners, and other miscellaneous accessories. You’ll love
the prices, as well as the massive selection of Mac and non-Mac electronics
products.
EveryMac.com: www.everymac.com
The author of this site claims that it is “the complete guide of every Macintosh,
Mac Compatible, and upgrade card in the world.” You can’t argue with that

too, for your Mac-related questions.
Inside Mac Games: www.imgmagazine.com
This is the best of the Mac gaming sites on the Web (at least in my humble
opinion). Order CDs of game demos, download shareware, check out game

Ten (Or So) Mac OS X Apps That
You Might Need Someday
D
ig around the Mac OS X Applications folder — or take a gander at the
System Preferences application’s main window — and you’ll run across
some programs and preferences that you may not use every day, but are still
kind of cool.
In this chapter, I tell you what some of these items do (and whether you’re
likely to get much from them). Space limitations forbid delving into these
potentially useful goodies elsewhere in this book — and they’d overflow that
space if I gave them the detailed how-to treatment here. So, to save space and
restore order in the galaxy, I briefly describe each one and then provide some
insights on whether you need it or not.
Almost everything I mention in this chapter includes a Mac OS Help feature.
Use it to discover more about how these goodies work. Just search Mac OS
Help for the item you’re interested in, and you’ll get an eyeful.
Web Sharing
Web Sharing enables others to share documents on your computer through the
Web. You can set up a Web site just by adding HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) pages and images to the Sites folder in your home folder, and then
activating Web Sharing in the Sharing pane of System Preferences.
Web Sharing works only while your Mac is connected to the Internet or an
internal network. In other words, if you use a modem and connect to the
Internet by dialing up, this application won’t be a lot of use to you because
your server (your Mac) will only be on the Internet when you’ve dialed up
and made a modem connection. When you’re not connected, your server won’t
be available, except to other computers on your local network. That’s not to
say that Web Sharing can’t be used this way, but you’ll have to tell remote users

when they’ll be able to find it — and then make sure you dial up and make a
connection at just that time. Another downside to this method is that almost
without exception, dial-up users will have a different IP address every time
they connect, so you would have to tell folks your new address every time.
Furthermore, even if you keep your modem connected to the Internet 24 hours
a day with a digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable-modem connection, using
this feature could violate your agreement with your Internet Service Provider
(ISP) because some ISPs prohibit you from running a Web site. Also, most cable
and DSL connections use dynamic IP address assignment through Dynamic
Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which means your IP address will change
from time to time.
On the other hand, some ISPs don’t care whether you run a Web site. Check
with yours if you’re concerned.
I do turn on this feature occasionally, but (because I don’t use it 24/7) I never
bothered to check with my ISP. Do me a favor and don’t rat me out.
FTP Access
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is kind of like Web Sharing: It allows folks on the
Internet to have access to files on your Mac. The difference is that FTP access
is specifically designed to let you make files available for download, and Web
Sharing is designed to let people view Web pages.
When you activate FTP by selecting the Allow FTP Access check box in the
Sharing pane of System Preferences, users on the Internet have the same
access to the contents of your Mac that they would if they were using file
sharing. (See Chapter 14 for more on file sharing.) People who don’t have
accounts on your Mac can access Public folders and Drop Boxes — or any
folder to which you grant everyone access, as I describe in Chapter 14.
Internet users can connect to your Mac with any FTP client application.
An FTP client is a program that offers FTP features — uploading files, down-
loading files, and so on. Better FTP clients can also do stuff like rename and
delete remote files. On the Mac, Transmit (my personal fave), Interarchy, and
Fetch are probably the best-known FTP clients. You can also find FTP clients
for Windows, Linux, and most other operating systems (but because I use
only Macs, I don’t know the names of the good ones).
382
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Most Internet browsers can serve as FTP clients as well as browsers (although
they’re mostly good only for downloading, and not much use for uploading,
deleting, renaming, and other such useful functions).
ColorSync Utility
ColorSync helps ensure color consistency when you’re scanning, printing,
and working with color images. This package includes ColorSync software as
well as pre-made ColorSync profiles for a variety of monitors, scanners, and
printers.
A ColorSync profile is a set of instructions for a monitor, scanner, or printer,
which tells the device how to deal with colors (and white) so the device’s
output is consistent with that of other devices (as determined by the ColorSync
profiles of the other devices). In theory, if two devices have ColorSync profiles,
their output (on-screen, on a printed page, or in a scanned image) should
match perfectly. Put another way, the red (or green or blue or white or any
other color) that you see on-screen should be exactly the same shade as the
red that you see on a printed page or in a scanned image.
383
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Mac OS X Apps That You Might Need Someday
To calibrate or not to calibrate?
One thing you might want to try, even if you never
plan to use ColorSync, is to calibrate your mon-
itor. This process adjusts the red, green, blue,
and white levels, and could make what you see
on your screen look better than it does now.
To calibrate your monitor, follow these steps:
1. Open the Displays System Preferences pane.
2. Click the Color tab and then write down the
Display Profile that your Mac is currently
using (it’s highlighted in the Display Profile
list).
3. Click the Calibrate button.
The Display Calibrator Assistant appears.
4. Follow the simple onscreen instructions to
calibrate your monitor and create a custom
display profile.
5. Give your profile a name and then click the
Continue button.
If you decide that you don’t like the results of your
calibration, just click the Display Profile that you
wrote down in Step 2 from the Display Profile list
in the Displays System Preference pane, and your
monitor will go back the way it was before you
calibrated it.

You’ll find the ColorSync Utility in /Applications/Utilities; use it to pick
a profile or check to see that the profile ColorSync is using is the right one for
your display, input, output, or proof device.
If you’re not a graphics artist working with color files and calibrating monitors
and printers to achieve accurate color matching, you probably don’t need
ColorSync (unless you’ve gotten hooked on iPhoto and want your printed
inkjet color pictures to match up correctly).
Image Capture
Image Capture is a nifty little application that you can use to download images
from a digital camera (or from a variety of scanners) to your Mac. You can
also use it to tell your Mac what program to launch when a digital camera or
scanner is connected to it. (It’s preset to open iPhoto unless you’ve told it
otherwise.) 
You’ll find it in your Applications folder. You can use it with many kinds of
digital cameras and a number of different scanner models, so if you have
more than one, you may be able to avoid having to install a separate applica-
tion for each.
Unfortunately, Image Capture doesn’t work with every digital camera. For
example, Image Capture did not recognize my relatively new Olympus digital
camera. To find out whether Image Capture works with your digital camera,
plug the camera into one of your Mac’s USB ports and open Image Capture.
If the Camera menu at the top of the window reads No devices found,
you’re out of luck. The same steps apply to your scanner, except that you’ll
be checking the Scanner menu.
Image Capture can automate some parts of the image-downloading process.
For example, you can set it up to download all images from the camera into a
preselected folder, or to open automatically when you connect your camera
to your Mac.
You may not want to use Image Capture if you prefer the program that came
with your digital camera (the program you use to import pictures from the
camera) or iPhoto. On the other hand, you may have to use Image Capture if
the program that came with your digital camera doesn’t work (or does work
but kinda sucks). And if your scanner lacks working software, Image Capture
might still work for you.
384
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If Image Capture doesn’t support your scanner, a shareware program for Mac
OS X called VueScan from Hamrick Software (www.hamrick.com) supports
scanning images with many different scanners, including ones that don’t
work with Image Capture. Its $60 price tag ($100 for the “Pro” version) is a
small price to pay if your scanner is just going to collect dust otherwise.
Finally, if the program that came with your camera doesn’t run under Classic
and Image Capture doesn’t work with your camera, you may have to reboot
with OS 9 to run the program. (For more info on running Classic and OS X,
and rebooting under OS 9.2.1, read through Chapter 12.)
Text to Speech
Use Text to Speech to convert on-screen text into spoken words from your
Mac. This application is pretty much unchanged from earlier versions of Mac
OS. With a whole slew of voices to choose from, you can have Text-to-Speech
read dialogs, or even documents, aloud.
Sometimes hearing is better than reading. For example, I sometimes use Text
to Speech to read a column or page to me before I submit it. If something
doesn’t sound right, I give it a final polish before sending it off to my editor.
You can activate this feature in the Speech System Preferences pane. Click
the Text to Speech tab to check it out.
VoiceOver
The camera pans back — a voice tells you what you’ve just seen, and suddenly
it all makes sense. Return with us now to those thrilling days of the off-camera
narrator. . . .
Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger introduces a new feature called VoiceOver, designed pri-
marily for the visually impaired. You’ll find it in the Universal Access System
Preferences pane, where it’s the first item in the Seeing tab. When it’s turned
on (keyboard shortcut: Ô+F5), your Mac talks to you about what is on your
screen. For example, if you clicked on the Desktop, your Mac might say some-
thing along the lines of, “Application, Finder; Column View; selected folder,
Desktop, contains 8 items.” It’s quite slick. For example, when you click a menu
or item in a menu, you hear its name spoken at once, and when you close a
menu you hear the words, “closing menu.” You even hear the spoken feedback
in the Print, Open, and Save (and other) dialogs.
385
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Mac OS X Apps That You Might Need Someday

VoiceOver is kind of cool (talking alerts are fun), but having dialogs actually
produce spoken text becomes annoying (real fast) for most folks. But check it
out! You might like it and find times when you want your Mac to read to you.
Speech Recognition
Speech Recognition enables your Mac to recognize and respond to human
speech. With this feature, you can issue verbal commands such as, “Get my
mail!” to your Mac and have it actually get your mail. You can also create
AppleScripts and then trigger them by voice.
An AppleScript is a series of commands, using the AppleScript language, that
tells the computer (and some applications) what to do.
You create AppleScripts with the Script Editor program, which you’ll find in
the AppleScript folder in the Applications folder.
You’ll need a microphone (some Macs have them built in) to use Speech
Recognition. And you’ll only be able to talk to your Mac when you’re using
applications that support Speech Recognition.
You’ll find the Speech Recognition tab to the Default Voice tab’s left in the
Speech pane of System Preferences.
This application is clever and kind of fun, but it’s also slow on all but the
fastest Macs, and requires a microphone. I’ve never been able to get Speech
Recognition to work well enough to continue using it beyond a few hours at
best. Still, it’s kind of neat (and it’s a freebie), and I’ve heard more than one
user profess love for it. So you might want to check it out.
NetInfo Manager
NetInfo is a hierarchical database that contains much of the configuration
information needed to manage what goes on behind the scenes of Mac OS X.
NetInfo knows all your settings, who has an account on your Mac, what network
addresses you’re using, and lots, lots more. With NetInfo Manager, which you’ll
find in Applications/Utilities, you can view and edit some of this information.
Although it has a Mac interface, the database info displayed there will be pretty
much incomprehensible to most folks.
386
Part V: The Part of Tens 

NetInfo is a central location for a lot of important information. With NetInfo
Manager, a savvy Mac user can do cool things that can’t be done with the
Network or Sharing System Preferences panes. But most average users won’t
want to play here. One suggestion: If you’re at all curious about the internals
of the UNIX operating system on which Mac OS X is based, start by learning a
bit about NetInfo before you dive into the hard-core UNIX stuff (see the next
section for a quick briefing).
UNIX Tools: Terminal, Console, 
and Activity Monitor
Mac OS X is based on the UNIX operating system, although its UNIX under-
pinnings are mostly hidden. While most Mac users are grateful that they can
ignore UNIX, you’ll find that if you know UNIX (or think you might like to), you
can do a lot of very geeky things with the UNIX tools included in Mac OS X.
You’ll find all three programs in the Utilities folder within your Applications
folder.
UNIX is not for the inexperienced or faint of heart. Before you even begin
experimenting with it, you should get yourself a good UNIX primer and learn
the ropes. And as usual, be very careful. Mucking around in the Mac OS X UNIX
files gives you access to lots of stuff that isn’t ordinarily available to you, which
can very quickly lead to major problems if you’re not absolutely sure what
you’re doing. If you want more info on UNIX, check out Unix Bible, 2nd Edition,
by Yves Lepage and Paul Iarrera (Wiley).
Terminal
Basically, UNIX is a command-line operating system: Instead of clicking buttons
and dragging icons around the Desktop, you type commands (not in English,
by the way) at a command line. To do this in Mac OS X, you use a program
called Terminal, which you’ll find in the Utilities folder in the Applications
folder.
Terminal is nothing more than a single window with a line (or many lines) of
very geeky-looking text — there are no menus or buttons to make your life
easier. So Terminal is mostly useless unless you speak a decent amount of UNIX.
387
Chapter 19: Ten (Or So) Mac OS X Apps That You Might Need Someday

Console
Console is another UNIX tool that’s used to show you technical messages from
Mac OS X — in UNIX-speak, of course. It shows what UNIX processes are run-
ning, what devices are in use, and logs messages from applications, processes,
and Mac OS X. Think of it as a UNIX troubleshooting and status-checking tool.
Unfortunately (as with Terminal), Console’s only window is a wall of super-
geeky-looking text — still no menus or buttons to make your life easier. Like
Terminal, Console is mostly useless unless you speak a decent amount of UNIX.
Activity Monitor
Activity Monitor might be more useful than Console for seeing what’s going on
under the hood, because it has a Mac interface (or at least it has some menus),
a Find text field, and columns that you can sort. Think of it as another, some-
what fancier, UNIX troubleshooting and status-checking tool. Unlike Terminal
and Console, which are entirely text-based, Activity Monitor gives you informa-
tion in an easier-to-digest and far more visual manner, as shown in Figure 19-1.

Appendix
Installing or Reinstalling 
Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger 
(Only If You Have To)
In This Chapter
 Installing (or reinstalling) Mac OS X Tiger
 Setting up OS X Tiger with Setup Assistant
 Running OS X Tiger and OS 9 on the same Mac
You’ll probably never need this Appendix. Some of you will get Mac OS X
10.4 Tiger pre-installed on a new Mac, and others will have installed it
long before buying this book. And so, I expect few of you will have to refer to
this Appendix to install OS X on your Mac for the very first time.
But (and there’s always a but, isn’t there?), someday something unexpected
might happen to your Mac. You could have a hard drive crash or a problem
starting up from your hard drive, or maybe you’ll see the prohibitory sign
when booting — all meaning that you’ll need to reinstall OS X. And so, I expect
some of you (I hope not many) will have to refer to this Appendix for instruc-
tions on reinstalling OS X.
A Mac OS X reinstallation is a pain-in-the-buttocks final step. Be sure you’ve
tried all the stuff in Chapter 15 before even thinking about reinstalling OS X.
If nothing else fixes your Mac, reinstalling Mac OS X could well be your final
option before invasive surgery (that is, trundling your Mac to a repair shop).
I save this solution for here at the very end of the book because it’s the
biggest hassle, and you don’t want to reinstall OS X if something easier can
correct the problem. So if you have to do a reinstallation, realize that this is
more or less your last hope (this side of the dreaded screwdriver, anyway).

In this Appendix, you’ll discover all you need to know to install or reinstall
OS X, if you should have to. I say reinstalling is a hassle because although you
won’t lose the contents of your Home folder, Applications you’ve installed, or
the stuff in your Documents folder (unless something goes horribly wrong or
you have to reformat your hard drive), you could lose the settings for some
System Preferences — which means you’ll have to reconfigure those panes
manually after you reinstall. And you may have to reinstall drivers for third-
party hardware such as mice, keyboards, tablets, and the like.
It’s not the end of the world, but it is almost always inconvenient. That said,
reinstalling OS X almost always corrects all but the most horrifying and
malignant of problems. And, as you’ll soon see, the process is (compared
to root-canal work or income taxes) relatively painless.
I’ll stay with you through it all, though; don’t you worry about a thing.
How to Install (or Reinstall) Mac OS X
In theory, you should have to install OS X only once. And in a perfect world,
that would be the case. But you may find occasions when you have to install/
reinstall it, such as
 If you get a new Mac that didn’t come with Mac OS X pre-installed
 If you have a catastrophic hard-drive crash that requires you to initialize
(format) your boot drive
 If any essential Mac OS X files become damaged, corrupted, or are
deleted, or renamed
The following instructions do double duty: They’re what you do to install OS X
for the first time on a Mac — and they’re also what you do if something hap-
pens to the copy of OS X that you boot your Mac from. That is, the following
describes both the process for installing and the process for reinstalling OS X.
The only difference is the choice you make in the Options window in Step 4.
If you’ve backed up or duplicated your entire hard drive, you might prefer to
reinstall from your backup disks, CDs, DVDs, or tapes rather than reinstalling
OS X from the Install Mac OS X DVD. That way, you’ll be certain that anything
you’ve tweaked on your Mac will be just the way you left it — your System
Preferences will be the way you like them and you won’t have to bother with
reinstalling drivers for your third-party hardware.
Here’s how to install (or reinstall) OS X, step by step:
1. Boot from your Install Mac OS X DVD by inserting the DVD into your
machine’s DVD drive and then restarting your Mac while holding

Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies 

When Mac OS X has finished booting your Mac, the Install program
launches automatically. Here is where you begin the process of installing
or reinstalling Mac OS X.
2. Unless you want to use a language other than English for the main lan-
guage of Mac OS X, click the Continue button (a blue arrow pointing
to the right) in the first screen you see.
If you do want to use another language, select the language by clicking
its name, and then click the Continue button.
3. Read the Welcome and Software License Agreement screens, clicking
the Continue button after each.
A sheet drops down, asking whether you agree to the terms of the
license agreement. If you don’t, you can’t go any farther, so I advise you
to go ahead and click the Agree button.
If you’re currently using any version of Mac OS except version 9.2.2,
you might next see a dialog with the warning that you can’t run Classic
applications unless you have Mac OS 9.2.2 or a later version installed. Of
course, you can’t install Mac OS 9.2.2 right now (you’re installing OS X!),
but you can click OK and install 9.2.2 later. (Mac OS X, version 10.4 Tiger
does not come with a Mac OS 9.2.2 Install CD, so you’re on your own here.)
If you have Mac OS 9.2.2 installed, you won’t see this dialog.
4. Choose the disk on which you want to install (or reinstall) Mac OS X
by clicking its icon once in the Select a Destination screen.
At the bottom of the Select a Destination screen is the Options button;
click it and a sheet drops down with three mutually exclusive choices:
a. Upgrade Mac OS X: Choose this option to upgrade an earlier ver-
sion of OS X installed on the disk you choose in Step 4. Your Home
and other files are left undisturbed; after the upgrade, things will
be (more or less) as they were before, except you’ll be running a
newer version of OS X.
b. Archive and Install: Choose this option to move all the System
components from your existing OS X installation into a folder
named Previous System and then install a fresh new copy of OS X.
The Previous System folder cannot be used to boot — but it does
contain any and all files that were in any of the OS X folders before
you upgraded.
If you select this option, a check box for a second option — Preserve
Users and Network Settings — becomes available. Mark it if you want
to import all the existing users of this Mac, their Home folders, and
their network settings — but still archive all the old System stuff
into the Previous System folder.
If you choose this option, you skip the Setup Assistant discussed
later in this Appendix.
391
Appendix: Installing or Reinstalling Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 (Only If You Have To)

c. Erase and Install: Choose this option if you want to completely
erase the disk that you selected in Step 4, starting completely from
scratch — which gives you a factory-fresh installation.
If you choose the Erase and Install option, the disk you selected in
Step 4 will be erased — and all your files will be deleted immediately!
You should only choose this option if you’ve backed up all your
documents and applications. In most cases, erasing the startup
disk is not necessary.
If you select this option, the Format Disk As pop-up menu appears.
Your choices are Mac OS Extended (Journaled), which is the one
you want, or Unix File System (the one you don’t want).
Unix File System is not a good choice for most OS X users. Suffice
it to say that 99.9 percent of you should absolutely and positively
avoid Unix File System like the proverbial plague (the other tenth-
of-one-percent know who they are — and why they need a UFS disk).
’Nuff said.
After you make your selection in this window, click OK to return to the
Select a Destination screen and then click Continue.
Now you have a choice of which installation to perform — easy or 
customized:
• Easy Install copies all Mac OS X onto your chosen hard drive
(as you choose in Step 4).
• Custom Install (click the Customize button at the bottom of the
screen) enables you choose to install only the items that you want
to install.
In almost all cases, whether you’re either doing a complete installation
or reinstallation, Easy Install is the right way to go — so that’s what I
assume you’ll choose for the rest of these steps.
5. To begin the installation, click the Install button.
The installer first checks your installation DVD for errors, and then
installs the operating system which takes 10 to 20 minutes. So now might
be a good time to take a coffee break (unless your machine is slow —
installation takes about an hour on a 400 MHz G4, and that’s enough for
lunch). When it’s done installing, your Mac will restart itself, and you can
begin using Mac OS X . . . hopefully trouble-free.
After your Mac reboots, the Setup Assistant appears, unless you’ve
chosen Archive and Install and also selected the Preserve Users and
Network Settings option, which would obviate the need for the Setup
Assistant (your settings from before the installation would be intact).
6. Work your way through all the Setup Assistant screens.
You have to do that housekeeping before you can begin working in OS X,
and I show you how in the next section.
392
Mac OS X Tiger For Dummies 

Getting Set Up with Setup Assistant
Assuming that your installation (or reinstallation) process goes well and your
Mac restarts itself, the next thing you should see (and hear) is a short, color-
ful movie that ends by transforming into the first Setup Assistant screen,
fetchingly named Welcome.
To tiptoe through the Setup Assistant, follow these steps:
1. When the Welcome screen appears, choose your country from the list
by clicking it once, and then click the Continue button.
If you need to hear instructions for setting up your Mac, press the
Escape key now to learn how to use VoiceOver to set up your computer.
If your country doesn’t appear in the list, select the Show All check box,
which causes a bunch of additional countries to appear in this list.
Choose yours by clicking it and then click the Continue button.
The Do You Already Own a Mac screen appears.
2. If you own another Mac, you can choose to transfer your date from it
to this Mac now by clicking the appropriate radio button — Transfer
My Information from Another Mac; Transfer My Information from
Another Partition on This Mac; or Do Not Transfer My Information —
and then clicking the Continue button.
If you choose to transfer your information, just follow the on-screen
instructions and wait for the transfer to complete — which could take an
hour or longer.
The Select Your Keyboard screen appears next. 
3. Choose a keyboard layout from the list by clicking it once; then click
the Continue button.
If you’re an American (or want to use an American keyboard setup),
click the U.S. listing. If you prefer a different country’s keyboard layout,
select the Show All check box, and a bunch of additional countries (as
well as a pair of Dvorak keyboard layouts) appears in the list. Choose
the one you prefer by clicking it — and then click the Continue button.
If the Setup Assistant detects more than one wireless network available,
you might see a screen enabling you to choose which one to use. If so,
choose the appropriate wireless network and then click the Continue
button.
The Enter Your Apple ID screen appears.
4. If you have an Apple ID, type your user name and password in the
appropriate fields and then click the Continue button. If you don’t
have an Apple ID or don’t want to provide yours at this time, leave
both fields blank and click the Continue button.
393
Appendix: Installing or Reinstalling Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 (Only If You Have To)

Click the Learn More button to find out more about an Apple ID and
what it can do for you. In a nutshell, it lets you make one-click purchases
at the iTunes Music Store, iPhoto, or the Apple Store. If you get one now,
you’ll also get a free, limited 60-day trial account with .Mac.
When you’re finished reading, click OK, and then click the Continue
button.
The Registration Information screen appears.
5. Fill out the fields (name, address, phone number, and so on) and then
click the Continue button.
If you’re interested in what Apple will and will not do with this informa-
tion, click the Privacy button on this screen and read the Privacy Policy.
The Thank You screen appears.
6. Click the Continue button.
The Create Your Account screen appears.
7. Fill in the Name, Short Name, Password, Verify, and Password Hint
fields, and then click the Continue button.
This first account that you create will automatically have administrator
privileges for this Mac.
Each of these fields has an explanation beneath it.
You can’t click the Continue button until you’ve filled in all five fields.
The Extend Your Mac Experience Online screen appears.
8. Select one of these four radio buttons and then click the Continue
button:
 I’ve Already Purchased a .Mac Box and Want to Enter the
Activation Key
 I Want to Purchase .Mac Online Now
 I’m Already a .Mac Member
 I Don’t Want to Purchase .Mac Right Now
When you’ve completed this selection, you’re essentially done though
you might see one or more of the following screens before you’re taken
to the OS X desktop. 
9. If you want to set up the Mail program now, click the appropriate radio
button — Use My Mac.com Account Only or Add My Existing Email
Account — fill in the blanks, and then click the Continue button.
The Select Time Zone screen appears.
10. Click your part of the world on the map, click to choose a city from
the pop-up menu, and then click the Continue button.
The Set the Date and Time screen appears.

Appendix: Installing or Reinstalling Mac OS X Tiger 10.4 (Only If You Have To)
Two ways to run two systems
Some folks have compelling enough reasons to
use older software that they’re willing to put up
with the extra complexity of running two oper-
ating systems — Mac OS X and Mac Classic. If
you’re planning on using Classic applications at
all, I need to tell you a little about how Mac OS X
and Classic (Mac OS 9.2.2) co-exist on the same
computer. (If you’d rather just learn how to use
Classic, you can skip this section and read Chap-
ter 12 instead.)
Both Mac OS 9.2.2 and OS X can either be
installed on the same volume — usually the
single hard drive in your Mac — or on separate
volumes. If they’re installed on a single volume,
as they would be if you got your Mac with Mac
OS X pre-installed, the files that make up Mac
OS 9.2.2 are buried within the complicated hier-
archy of Mac OS X components. You probably
won’t have much to do with them, other than
customizing some preferences. If you’ve used
any version of Mac OS 9 (9.0.1, 9.0.4, or even 9.1),
you won’t find the familiar System Folder or be
able to work with its files in the way that you’re
used to.
In some cases, Mac OS 9.2.2 and Mac OS X are
installed on separate volumes on your Mac.
Volumes can be individual hard drives, or they
can be partitions of a single hard drive. A parti-
tion looks and behaves like a hard drive, but it’s
actually just a section of the disk that is com-
pletely separate from the rest of the drive. In this
arrangement, Mac OS X and Mac OS 9.2.2 each
have their own partitions on the same hard drive.
That means that you can install and customize a
Mac OS 9.2.2 drive without affecting Mac OS X.
They behave as if they were completely separate
drives. When you launch Classic while running
Mac OS X, Mac OS 9.2.2 launches from the other
partition, and you have access to its System
Folder, just as you would on a Mac with Mac OS
9.2 as the primary operating system.
If you’re installing Mac OS X from scratch and
you’re comfortable with concepts such as drive
partitioning and the like, I recommend that you
install Mac OS 9.2.2 on two partitions or hard
drives. In other words, install 9.2.2 on both parti-
tions and then install OS X on one of them. Let the
copy of OS 9.2.2 on the same disk (or partition)
as OS X be the one that you use for Classic. Use
the other copy of OS 9.2.2 to boot from when you
need to run Classic apps or use Classic exten-
sions/control panels that aren’t supported by
Classic (such as DVD Player, CD Audio Player,
some CD burning software, full functionality for
iTunes, and so on). You’ll have more flexibility
when using Mac OS 9.2.2 if you follow this
advice, and you’ll be able to troubleshoot both
operating systems more easily if you keep them
on separate drives. You’ll also find that Classic
starts up faster because it won’t have all the
extra control panels and extensions to load. You
might also find it more convenient to store all
your Classic applications on the partition or drive
with OS 9.2.2 only rather on the OS X drive or par-
tition. That’s how I have the Mac I used for writ-
ing this book arranged (check the screen shots).
If you have multiple partitions or drives — each
of which has a copy of Mac OS 9.2.2 — you can
choose which copy to use when launching
Classic. Make this choice in the Classic pane of
System Preferences. (Read more about this in
Chapter 12.)
In addition to running Classic applications under
OS X, you can choose to boot from Mac OS 9.2.2
any time you like. After you’ve installed OS X, you
can switch between it and OS 9.2.2 quickly and
easily, assuming your Mac allows you to boot into
Mac OS 9. (Read about this process in detail at
the end of Chapter 12.)
If you’ve got two copies of OS 9.2.2, boot from
the one that’s not on the same drive or partition
as OS X.

11. Set today’s date and the current time, and then click the Continue
button.
12. When the next screen appears, click the Done button.
The assistant will quit and in a few moments, the Mac OS X Desktop will
appear. That’s it. You’re done.
For the very last time in this book (and it bears repeating): Don’t forget that
Macs sold after January 1, 2003 aren’t able to boot into Mac OS 9 at all. Classic
is the only option for running OS 9 software on Macs made in 2003 and beyond.
