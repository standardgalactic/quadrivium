PAINTING PROBLEMS 
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
To achieve top-quality painting results simply requires the 
use of good equipment and materials, meticulous 
preparation and careful application of the paint. 
  
 
 
Although painting is the most popular of all DIY tasks, it has 
its own real danger areas which can cause problems. These 
are all avoidable by taking simple, common-sense measures.
  
 
 
Basic skills and taking the time to work to simple guidelines 
are all that are needed to avoid painting problems. 
  
Most problems encountered in painting can be avoided 
simply by taking the time to prepare all surfaces, materials 
and equipment thoroughly. Never rush the job or attempt to 
cut corners - this will lead to problems and a disappointing 
finish, requiring costly and time-consuming remedial work to 
put things right. 
 
2  - Fault finder  
Painting problems arise from an error in preparation, poor 
working conditions, using low-grade equipment, or incorrect 
application of the paint. Using too much paint on the brush, 
and painting on a dirty, greasy or wet surface are typical 
mistakes. Here are some commonly found faults, and what 
you can do to prevent and rectify them.  
 
3  - Brushmarks 
Failing to rub smooth a poor surface or using a low-grade 
brush with an inadequate amount of bristles are basic faults. 
Wash surfaces thoroughly, rub down, then wipe with a lint-
free cloth dampened with white spirit.  
 
 
 
4  - Flaking 
Poor surface preparation can cause paint to flake away. On 
woodwork, painting over dust and grease is the likely cause. 
Remove wax polish from skirtings. On walls and ceilings, 
applying emulsion over an unclean surface, old distemper or 
dampness is the fault. 
 
 
 
If distemper is present it has to be removed or sealed. You 
will only find distemper in older houses which have not been 
decorated for many years. If you suspect it might be 
present, test by wetting it with water - if it's distemper, the 
water will dissolve it and it will come away. Wet and scrape 
away any loose distemper, then apply a plaster sealer 
 
5  - No hiding power 
If the previous coat is still visible, then it is likely that no 

undercoat has been used, or the undercoat was the wrong 
colour. Overthinning the paint, overbrushing, or 
understirring can also be the cause. Where necessary, use 
an extra undercoat.  
 
6  - Loss of gloss 
When gloss paint loses its shine, not allowing sufficient 
drying time between coats can be the problem. 
Overbrushing the paint or overthinning the paint may also 
be causes. Painting in very cold conditions is another factor. 
 
 
 
 
7  - Runs 
If the paint is applied too 
thickly or is not brushed out 
enough, then runs and 
wrinkles will result. A 
common cause is trying to 
paint around fittings such as 
door handles. Apart from the 
likelihood of smudging paint 
onto the fitting, it is far b
to remove all fittings before 
painting (1). 
etter 
 
 
 
The only remedy is to allow the paint to harden for a week, 
then rub down smooth with wet-and-dry paper before 
repainting. 
 
8  - Specks and pimples 
Caused by dust and specks getting into the paint. In outside 
work especially, wind-blown dust can get into the paint tin 
contaminating the whole batch. This can be avoided by 
transferring small amounts of paint into a paint kettle - so if 
dust does get in, only a little will be affected and this can be 
discarded. 
 
 
 
Remove dust from the lid of 
the paint tin (2). Dust on 
surfaces can also be picked 
up on the brush bristles and 
spread onto the work.  
 
 
 

Make certain that corners a

free cloth around a pointe
stick, dampening it with white
spirit and cleaning out the 
corner thoroughly (3).

Also make sure that 
keyholes, top edges of doors 
and other nooks and c
are cleaned (4). 
 
If a whole tin of paint is 
contaminated, then strain it 
into a clean container th
muslin stretched over the 
top. 
 
 
 
Treat the problem the same as for runs. 
 
9 - Blisters 
 
These are caused by painting on a wet surface, or onto old, 
soft or lifting paint. Again, treat the problem as for runs.  
 
 
 
 
10 - Yellow stains on gloss  
 
This happens when resin from a knot in the surface of wood 
starts to bleed through to the paint surface. This is 
prevented by coating the knots with a liquid called shellac 
knotting which is effectively a sealer. If staining occurs, you 
have to strip off the paint and redecorate.  
 
11 - Damp patches 
 
Where dampness caused by 
rainwater or a plumbing leak 
leaves a stain on a wall or 
ceiling, painting over it will 
not solve the problem as the 
patch will reappear. Large 
areas should be coated with 
aluminium primer sealer 
before using emulsion; for 
economy, where only a small 
area is concerned, you can 
use an aerosol (5). 
 
12 - Fluff on paint  
 
Usually the result of someone's fluffy clothes brushing 

against the wet paint. Typically, this happens when painting 
a door and leaning against a wet door frame. This can be 
avoided by painting the door and frame on different days. 
Proceed as for treating runs.  
 
1 3 - Equipment 
Buy good-quality brushes. These have long, densely packed 
bristles which hold the paint well and give good coverage. 
Poor-quality brushes have short, sparse bristles which give 
uneven coverage. 
 
 
 
A good-quality brush, if looked after, will last a long time 
and prove more economical in the end.  
 
 
 
Even a top-quality brush will 
shed a few bristles at first. 
So, before using it, dampen it
in clean water and run it over 
clean brickwork to get rid of 
dust and loose bristles (6).

poor-quality foam roller will 
give uneven coverage and tends to spatter the paint around.
