AP English Literature & Composition For Dummies 

Introduction
A
P English Literature & Composition For Dummies prepares you for — you guessed it —
the AP Literature and Composition Exam (not to be confused with the AP English
Language and Composition exam, which covers all-purpose, general writing on current
events, personal experience, and culture). This exam is a product of the College Board,
a not-for-profit outfit based in Princeton, New Jersey. The College Board is the group of edu-
cators and educational institutions that administers the SAT, the PSAT/NMSQT, and other
laugh-a-minute hurdles that you face before entering college. “AP” stands for “advanced
placement,” which means that anyone passing the exam has demonstrated college-level
achievement before actually entering an ivy-covered building. In other words, the AP label
is for serious brainwork.
Did I scare you? Calm down. AP material is tough, but it’s also teachable. You don’t have to
be a natural-born literary genius to score well on the AP English exam. You just have to
scrape the rust off your thinking cap and do some of the exercises in this book. In fact, you
don’t even have to go through all the exercises. (You’ll still have some time to download
some music and chat with your friends.) After you get acquainted with the AP exam format
and brush up on your reading and writing skills, you can score big on the AP English
Literature and Composition exam.
Most people taking an AP exam spend a year in an AP course, probably in a real classroom
but increasingly in virtual, online courses. However, you can take the exam even if you’ve
never taken an official AP course — the test is available to all those willing to glue them-
selves to uncomfortable chairs, spit out answers, and pay the exam fee. Homeschoolers and
people resuming their education after time away from school (welcome back!) can also take
the AP English Literature and Composition exam.
AP English courses are generally souped-up versions of regular junior or senior English
classes, with extra reading and writing assignments and perhaps tougher grading standards.
Again, not to worry. With AP English Literature & Composition For Dummies you can prepare
for both the course and the exam because most assignments and tests in the AP English
course closely resemble the work you have to do on the AP English exam.
If you’re a fairly good English student — and if you aren’t, this book will help you sharpen
your skills — you’ll find that the AP English Literature and Composition exam isn’t much
more difficult than the tests you’ve faced in English class before. In fact, in some ways it may
even be easier than the exams you’re used to. All AP exams are designed by experts with
tons of time to check the clarity of every question — not by the average classroom teacher
who has to create essay and multiple choice questions while doing the wash, finding a
renewable caffeine source, and walking the dog. Oh, and did I mention that classroom teach-
ers have to correct the tests and homework they gave last week too, even as they spin out
new questions? No wonder so many English tests are punctuated by announcements such as
“In section four, choice D should read “Homer’s Odyssey,” not “Homer’s Simpson.” The AP
English Literature and Composition exam taxes your brain, but at least it’s fair and accurate.

About This Book
After a quick overview of the exam and a crash course on timelines and strategies for test
preparation, this book hits each of the genres (types) of literature covered on the exam.
Within each genre, I review the basic elements and tell you what to look for when you’re read-
ing. I also show you how to keep track of what you found — important events, characters,
themes, and elements of style. To improve your literary skills — and grades! — even more,
I detail the easiest strategies for writing an essay about poetry, prose, and dramatic works.
I also explain the general format of the most common multiple-choice questions for each
genre. I give you a step-by-step method for approaching each type of multiple-choice ques-
tion and supply examples and explanations. Next I tackle the essays you may have to write
on a literary text from each genre. I help you decode the prompt — the English-teacher term
for the essay question you have to answer — and show you how to gather evidence and for-
mulate a thesis. After you’ve figured out how to approach multiple-choice and essay ques-
tions, I hit you with a practice chapter complete with answers and explanations. I also throw
in chapters on two types of AP questions that require special approaches: the paired-passages
essay and the open-ended essay. Finally, I offer two complete AP English tests, complete with
answers, explanations, and scoring guides, so you can see how you’re doing.
Conventions Used in This Book
In this book, I used the Auto-Parts Distributors Convention and the Flat-Earth Society
Convention to road-test the practice exams. No, not really. The conventions I used are fairly
simple to grasp:
 When I tell you about a Web site, I use monofont to indicate the address.
 Bold text highlights key words in bulleted lists and the action parts of numbered steps.
 Anytime I define a term, I set that term in italics. Literary terminology isn’t as prominent
on the AP as it used to be, but some words still appear, and you should know them.
What You’re Not To Read
As an English teacher I find it almost impossible to restrict anyone’s reading. But as a human
being who often needs 25 hours in a day, even without time for little luxuries such as eating
and sleeping, I understand that you may skip some things in this book. So if you need to skip
anything, jump over the sidebars. They contain interesting information, but you certainly
don’t need them in order to pass the test.
Foolish Assumptions
Years ago I taught a great kid named Ralph. Ralph, though only ten at the time, was smart,
creative, and skeptical. “Oh yeah? Show me!” was his basic attitude toward life. When I wrote
this book, I imagined Ralph, only older and wiser. These are the assumptions that I made
about Ralph and about you, the reader:

AP English Literature & Composition For Dummies 

 You plan to take the AP English Literature and Composition exam within a year, and
you want to be prepared.
 Even if you’re enrolled in an AP English course, you’d like a little extra practice or a
chance to refresh your reading comprehension and writing skills with this book.
 You have a life, so you have no time for longwinded, meaningless explanations.
 You have already read a lot of high-quality literature in your English classes, and you’ve
done some writing about these works.
 You have a reasonable grasp of English grammar.
How This Book Is Organized
To help you navigate through this book quickly and easily, I organized similar chapters into
parts — seven of them. Here’s a quick description of each.
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview
of the AP Lit Exam and Prep
You don’t want to walk into the AP English Literature and Composition exam and say the
equivalent of “Hi, my name is Fred and you are . . . ?” The exam should be an old friend, with
no surprises in store. This part explains everything: what the test looks like, how much time
you have, even how to sign up. I also tell you how to get ready no matter how much time you
have before the exam. And for you “I-work-only-under-pressure” types, I describe the best
way to spend the last weeks and the night before the exam. Finally, I give you some tips on
getting the most out of your English class. A good score on the AP exam is valuable, but so is
a high grade in your English course!
Part II: Poetry in Motion
I happen to have thousands of favorite poems, but I recognize that not every reader is as
nuts about verse as I am. Whether you like poetry or not, in this part I help you decode a
poem, dig for deeper meanings, and recognize elements of poetic style. I show you how to
ace multiple-choice poetry questions and how to compose a great essay on a poetry selec-
tion. Then I give you tons of practice questions, all with answers and explanations.
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama
The AP English exam throws bits of novels, memoirs, essays, and plays at you and then
asks you to figure out what’s what. So you won’t feel as if you’re being thrown to the wolves,
I tell you what kind of prose and drama passages you may meet on the exam and what sorts
of questions to expect. Then I take you through every type of passage, explain the best
approach to each one, and give you practice, practice, and then, for a change of pace, more
practice.

Introduction

Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay
Okay, I admit it: These two types of questions are together in this part because they don’t fit
anywhere else. They’re too weird, so I put them here so they can be weird together and find
happiness at last. Paired passages are two literary selections placed side by side in the same
question. You may have to write a compare/contrast essay about the duo. The open-ended
essay gives you some elbow room; you get to choose a work to write about. This part pro-
vides tips, strategies, and all kinds of helpful information about this fairly important chunk of
the test, along with sample questions and answers.
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams
Here you hit the big time — two full-length AP English Literature and Composition exams.
These tests aren’t from the College Board, which understandably is sitting on the rights to its
own material. I wrote these tests, but they’re close enough to the official exam to prepare
you well for test day, which surprisingly isn’t a national holiday. Each exam is accompanied
by a chapter of answers, explanations, and scoring guides.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without a part of tens. In this part, I explain the ten
ways to kill your essay score and the ten ways to improve your English skills without study-
ing. Even though these chapters are short, sweet, and to the point, they’re chock-full of
useful information.
Part VII: Appendixes
Which literary works should you choose for the open-ended essay? Which ones reward
you with great stories, amazingly beautiful writing, and incredible originality? Check out
Appendix A to find out. Nervous about your grammar skills? Check out Appendix B for a
lightning-fast review.
Icons Used in This Book
No, I didn’t design these cute little drawings myself, but I love them all the same. In this book
you find four icons, each of which functions like a tap on the shoulder, alerting you to an
important point. Here’s what they mean.
You can’t learn to ride a bike unless you actually have a bike. Similarly, you can’t learn to
answer questions or to recognize elements of literature unless you see some examples. This
icon alerts you to a sample question that resembles those on the actual exam.
The souvenir you take home is sometimes the best part of vacation. This icon identifies the
most essential ideas — the ones you want to “take home” and make a part of your life.

Check out this icon for a little grease to smooth the path to success.
Heading for a cliff? This icon tells you how to swerve and avoid a fall in your score.
Where to Go From Here
In writing this book, I cover all the bases — poetry, fiction and nonfiction prose, and drama.
I provide practice in both multiple-choice and essay questions. But you don’t have to touch
every base in order to hit a homerun on the AP English exam. So don’t feel like you have to
read chapters that contain info you already know. Think about your skills as an English stu-
dent, and then follow the table of contents to find guidance and practice for your weakest
points. For instance, if you aren’t sure what the test is like, check out Part I. If you need
more poetry experience, turn to Part II. Or, if everything’s a blur and you aren’t sure where
to begin, try Practice Exam 1 in Chapter 16. Score it with help from Chapter 17, analyze your
performance, and then hit the sections that address the topics that you didn’t know. And
remember: No matter what, June inevitably follows May, and the test will be over someday.

et ready to read this part like a racer. In Chapter 1,
you’re in the starting block, scanning the track,
checking out what’s where, and sneaking a glance at the
trophy awaiting you at the finish line. In other words,
Chapter 1 tells you everything you need to know about the
AP English Literature and Composition exam — what the
test is like, how to sign up, and whether you should take an
AP English Literature class. Chapter 2 is all about time and
is aimed at both marathoners and sprinters. It explains
how to hone your skills in reading and writing if you have a
few months or more to prepare for the AP exam, if you’re
reading this book only a week or so before the exam, or
even (gulp!) the night before. Chapter 3 addresses overall
fitness. I tell you how to get the most out of your English

I
t started in kindergarten, right? Someone pushed a pencil into your chubby little hand
and said, “This is a test.” All of a sudden you weren’t allowed to talk to your friends, ask a
handy grownup for help, or play with that interesting new purple crayon. You left the land
where learning was fun and entered Test Land. And you’re still in it! But now the stakes feel
higher, especially for the AP, which comes with its own shrink-wrap, barcode labels, student
packs, and color-coded sections. The only thing that remains the same is that you still
aren’t allowed to talk, ask for most types of help, or play with a cool new crayon.
Regardless of your situation, while you’re in AP English Exam Land you need a map. And
you’re in luck because in this chapter, I give you just that. I tell you what to expect — what
the test looks like, how long it takes, how to sign up, what it covers, and all sorts of un-fun
but useful things.
The Content and Structure of the Exam
When you walk into the test room on a lovely day in May, what kind of questions will you
face? Briefly, the College Board hits you with two sections, one for multiple-choice and one
for essays. Check out this chart for more details:

Two essay questions are based on a piece of
literature (a poem, a passage from a play or
novel, and so on) that’s provided on the exam;
the third is an open-ended essay based on a
work of literary quality that you choose

Literary selections on the exam may include anything from Tudor times (16th century)
onwards. The selections will most likely be American or British, though works from other
English-speaking countries may pop up as well. Literature translated into English from
another language is also fair game. One-third to slightly less than half of the literature is usu-
ally poetry.
In addition to the time it takes for you to complete the exam, tack on 45 minutes to an hour
for getting settled, listening to directions, taking a break, and having your paper collected at
the end. Expect to be at the test center for about four hours. (I recommend that you get there
30 to 45 minutes early just to make sure you’re registered on time and aren’t flustered as the
test begins.) When all is said and done, add about two weeks for screaming, “It’s over!”
Taking a Closer Look at Typical 
AP Exam Questions
Hamlet asks, “To be or not to be?” That’s probably the most famous question ever asked, but
you won’t find it on the AP English Literature and Composition exam. After all, who could
possibly know the right answer? But you will find questions — lots of them! — when you sit
down on AP exam day. This section gathers the usual suspects, the question types that
appear year after year, so you can make their acquaintance and ace the test.

Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 
What to expect if you take an AP English class
Every teacher of AP English has a certain degree of free-
dom in the design of the course. This is a very good idea,
too. In my experience, getting English teachers to agree
on something is a little harder than herding cats. Though
AP English Literature classes vary, some things remain
the same:
 An AP English Literature course must, according to
College Board rules, throw college-level work at
you. In other words, the course material has to be
difficult.
 The College Board doesn’t mandate a particular
reading list, but it does ask that students read a
wide variety of literature in the AP class. By the
time you finish your course, the College Board wants
you to have read something from every genre and
every time period from the 16th century through the
present day. Both British and American writers must
be on the reading list as well as some translated
works. (You don’t have to read everything in your AP
year; you just have to read it sometime.)
 All the material is supposed to be of good literary
quality, which means writing that rewards close
reading. If you read a work once and you get it all, it
isn’t AP material. However, if you find something
new to think about every time you read a particular
work, you’ve witnessed literary quality. (For more
detail on determining whether a work is of good lit-
erary quality, flip to Chapter 14.)
 Expect the amount of reading to equal or surpass
the amount you read in an honors English class. Ten
or 12 full-length works and a good fistful of poetry is
what you should expect.
 Some AP English teachers start you off with home-
work for the summer. You may have to read a couple
of books or write something to hand in on the first
day of school. Oh, joy!
 Expect to write a lot. In fact, expect to write every-
thing from informal journal entries to polished essays.
 The grading may be tougher in an AP class than in a
regular, non–AP English section. Evaluation of your
work in an AP course is more stringent because
teachers apply college-level standards.

The multiple-choice section
The multiple-choice questions, at their easiest, are standard reading comprehension queries.
At their most difficult, however, these questions are downright torturous. The exam writers
ask you to shoehorn your interpretation of the literary work into one of five choices, none of
which may be worded exactly the way you perceive the poem or passage. Somewhere in the
middle (in terms of difficulty) are questions that address how the piece is written or the way
in which the writing technique and meaning work together. The following sections go over
the most common types of multiple-choice questions. For more information on these ques-
tions, check out Chapters 6 (poetry) and 11 (prose and drama).
Vocabulary-in-context
The AP English selections are tough, and many times they come with tough vocabulary. Or
they may come with common vocabulary that has an obscure meaning. For example, you
may see a question like this one:
In the context of line 34, “fall” means
(A) autumn
(B) slip
(C) hit the deck
(D) attachment of fake hair
(E) loss of respect or approval
The tricky part here is deciding which meaning appears in line 34, because all of the answers
may be definitions of “fall.” Yes, even choice (D). Look it up if you don’t believe me!
Literal meaning
To see whether you can decode complex writing, the exam writers ask you what happened
on the simplest, literal level. However, because the exam is supposed to be difficult (and
because great writers often employ complex sentences), you may have to untangle compli-
cated syntax, the literary term for how the sentence is put together in order to unearth a
simple fact. Here’s a type of question you may come across from this category:
The actions of the shopkeeper include all of the following EXCEPT
(A) faking celebrity autographs
(B) inserting spinach leaves between chapters 28 and 29 of his rival’s autobiography
(C) charging a “shipping and handling” fee to customers in the store
(D) playing annoyingly soft versions of hard-rock classics
(E) hiring an indie band to promote his store
All you have to do to answer this sort of question is figure out what’s being asked (in this
case, the answer that does not appear), and then you simply have to go back to the passage
and check the facts. However, decoding the passage may turn your hair gray. For help with
reading comprehension, turn to Chapter 5 (for poetry) or 9 (for prose and drama).
11
Chapter 1: Flying Over the AP Lit Exam: An Overview

Tone and diction
Wow, do the exam writers love tone! I don’t know why they’re so stuck on this topic, but they
are. You have to determine whether the passage sounds sad, argumentative, sarcastic, or
ironic. Tone often depends partly on diction, or word choice (formal, colloquial, and so on).
Check out this example:
The tone of the passage may best be characterized as
(A) nostalgic
(B) ironic
(C) descriptive
(D) speculative
(E) respectful
As you’re reading a passage, hear it in your head and think about the author’s language to get
a head start on tone. Put those factors together with meaning, and you’ve got a winner.
Inference and attitude
Inference questions ask you to extend beyond what’s stated in the selection. They force you
to take the next logical step. You also may be asked to figure out the attitude of the author or
of a character or speaker toward a certain topic or issue, based on the clues in the selection.
Here’s what an inference question might look like:
The shopkeeper is never arrested most likely because
(A) the cop is involved in the spinach incident
(B) the cop has a deep-seated fear of spinach
(C) the shopkeeper’s humble assistant has super powers
(D) everyone in the village loves spinach leaves
(E) the shopkeeper becomes a superhero, stops time, and removes the evidence
Okay, I played around a little here, but I know you get the point. You have to leap beyond the
passage into the territory of probability, using the content of the passage as your guide.
Figurative language
Things aren’t always what they seem in literary works. After all, just to make things interest-
ing and to add meaning, authors often employ figurative language. For instance, symbols,
metaphors, and similes show up all over the place (including on the AP English exam). Check
out this sample question:
The spinach leaves in line 12 may symbolize
(A) the shopkeeper’s love of nature
(B) the rival’s lack of muscle tone
(C) an unhealthy attachment to vegetables
(D) death
(E) the gap between appearance and reality
12
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

I threw in choices (D) and (E) because those themes appear nearly everywhere in literature.
However, when you answer this sort of question, be sure to focus on the element of figurative
language (the symbol, metaphor, or simile, for example) that they’re asking about — not just
on the piece in general.
Form, structure, and style
Don’t expect a ton of multiple-choice questions filled with literary terms describing form,
structure, and style. Even though literary terms still appear here and there on the exam, they
seem to be falling out of favor in recent years. However, you’ll definitely see questions that
address how the piece is written. Even though you may not see a question about literary
terms, it never hurts to be prepared. Take a look at this example:
The style of the fourth paragraph differs from that of the first three paragraphs in that it is
(A) descriptive, not metaphorical
(B) argumentative, not descriptive
(C) symbolic, not literal
(D) analytical, not metaphorical
(E) expository, not analytical
Even without the fancy literary vocabulary, these kinds of questions can be tough because
you have only a couple of minutes to examine a paragraph or two and figure out which terms
apply. To answer this type of question, look at the section of text that the question focuses
on and try out the most likely candidates for Answer of the Year. See what fits the text.
The essay section
On the essay portion of the AP English exam, the College Board tests your skills, not your
ability to recall information. The questions are designed to determine whether you know
how to analyze a literary work and write about it, not to see whether you can name four
Romantic poets. Nor do you have to memorize dates or know the names and characteristics
of literary movements. In fact, you aren’t expected to have any factual stuff stored in your
memory except some literary terms. And even then, you don’t need to know many of them.
You do, however, need to prove that you can do the following:
 Relate the way a piece is written to its meaning and its effect on the audience. Even
though they aren’t as common in the multiple-choice section of the exam, form, struc-
ture, and style questions are frequent fliers on the essay portion. For instance, you may
see questions that ask you to comment on the poetic devices that the author employs
or to discuss the way in which one element of fiction (setting or characterization, per-
haps) contributes to the effect of the piece as a whole.
 Provide evidence for your assertions. Support for your claims is a key element of the
essay. When you write the first two essays, you’re expected to quote directly from
the literary selections provided. You can’t easily quote when you write the open-ended
essay (unless you have a very good memory), but you do need to use details from the
work that you’re discussing.
The essay questions have what are called prompts. These prompts provide a central idea that
your essay must address in the context of the literary selection provided or the literary work
you’ve chosen for the open-ended question. You’ve probably seen prompts in every English
class you’ve ever taken. Here are a few examples: “Discuss the role of friendship in . . .”;
13
Chapter 1: Flying Over the AP Lit Exam: An Overview

“Discuss loyalty to family or country conflicts with personal morality in . . .”; “Discuss the
role of figurative language in . . .”; We English teachers manufacture prompts even when
we’re sleeping. (Kinda creepy, huh?)
The open-ended essay has a prompt and then a list of suggested works. You can choose
one of those works to write about, or you can substitute something of similar quality. Just
remember that on the AP English exam, “quality” is not your call. The College Board graders
decide. Your best bet is to play it safe and choose a work that you studied in school. You can
write a winning Pulitzer Prize essay on your favorite Spiderman comic some other time.
Check out Chapter 14 for more tips on choosing works for the open-ended essay.
One weird breed of AP English essay is the paired selection. Not every exam has one of these
paired essay questions, but many do. The pairs may be two poems, two prose pieces, or one
of each genre. They address the same subject or consider the same themes. The prompt asks
you to compare and contrast the works. Nervous? Don’t be. Turn to Chapter 15 for help.
All Things Score-Related
When you finish the AP English exam, your job is over, but the scoring gnomes of the College
Board are just getting started. The multiple-choice sheets are bundled up and sent through a
scanner, and the essays are sent to hotels where they drink margaritas and eat macadamia
nuts from the minibar. Okay, I’m kidding about the margaritas and the macadamia nuts, but
not about the hotels. Here’s how it works: The College Board hires platoons of high school
and college English teachers and sends them, as well as the essays, to hotels. For one fun-
filled week, the teachers read and grade all those essays while ingesting vast amounts of caf-
feine. You knew you wanted to be an English teacher, didn’t you?
Multiple-choice scoring
During multiple-choice scoring, all those darkened ovals made with No. 2 pencil lead flash
through a scanning machine, and then out pops a number, which is determined this way:
 The multiple-choice counts as 45 percent of your final score.
 Each correct multiple-choice answer receives one point. Questions left blank receive
no points.
 Every wrong multiple-choice answer deducts 1⁄4 point. Therefore, it’s best to guess only
if you can eliminate a couple of choices.
 The raw multiple-choice score is converted with a complicated formula that varies
slightly from test to test. The College Board has platoons of statisticians who create
this formula based on the average number of students who chose the correct answer.
Most students panic a little the first time they try their hand at an AP multiple-choice sec-
tion. Even excellent readers who can crack a poem at first glance find the multiple-choice
questions difficult. Not to worry: Simply practice with this book and you won’t have that ini-
tial panic on exam day.
Also, calm your nerves with this information: You can get quite a few multiple-choice ques-
tions wrong (10 or even a few more) and still score a five overall, which is the highest score
you can get on the exam. Furthermore, the College Board expects that most students will
leave some questions blank. After all, the exams have approximately 55 multiple-choice ques-
tions, to be answered in 60 minutes. Plus you have to read the selections. Not surprisingly,
time is an issue. But remember that it’s an issue for everyone taking the test, and the scoring
allows for that fact.
14
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

Essay scoring
Scoring is always a touchy subject. In fact, fights sometimes break out about which multiple-
choice answer is better. Luckily, those fights take place secretly in the College Board head-
quarters while the exam is being written. Essay fights, on the other hand, occur in public
while the tests are being reviewed.
Here’s some background on the essay scoring process: The College Board runs workshops on
essay scoring for all the teachers hired to slap numbers on your brilliant writing. At those
workshops, teachers are given sample student essays to grade as well as a set of very specific
standards for grading. Then the fun begins! After they’ve graded their sample essays, the teach-
ers have to compare the scores that they awarded with the official College Board scores. You
probably can’t even imagine how passionate people get about one point! (Seriously, English
teachers — and I include myself — need to get a life.) After four or five rounds, most graders
see what the College Board is looking for, and the room begins to calm down.
Here’s the lowdown on essay scoring:
 Each essay is given a grade from 0–9. Nine is the highest score, but anything in the 
7-and-up range deserves a pat on the back.
 You’ll almost always receive at least one point on an essay, just for trying. The only
way to get a zero is to leave the essay blank or to ignore the prompt and write some-
thing completely different from what the question is actually asking.
 The scoring is holistic. In other words, the grader doesn’t award 10 percent for good
writing, 25 percent for evidence, 17 percent for originality, and so on. Instead, the
graders simply go through the whole thing once (okay, maybe twice) and select a score
they feel is appropriate. Because you can’t attend a workshop on grading — and
believe me, watching grass grow is more fun — in this book I’ve created grids to help
you arrive at a realistic number. The grids appear in Chapters 17 and 19.
 The graders consider the depth of your analysis and the amount and relevance of
the evidence that you’ve provided to back up your ideas. Basically, they want to
see that you can read beyond the literal level and that you can make and support a
case for your interpretation.
The graders also look at the quality of your writing. I hate to admit this fact, but grammar
and spelling count only if the errors seriously impede the reader from understanding what
the writer is trying to convey. The graders are much more interested in writing style —
whether your work reads fluently and shows a command of the language.
 You can get by in the essay section without using official lit-speak. All you really need
to do is to analyze the material in regular, everyday language. However, your graders
are English teachers, and their hearts beat a little faster when they see terms such as
assonance, protagonist, and so forth. Throw them in if you’re confident they make sense
and connect to a significant point about the literature; leave them out if they don’t.
Steer clear of the “laundry list” approach to literary terminology. In other words, don’t
just work your way through five or six terms, saying that they do or do not appear in
the selection. Also, don’t define the terms. Your graders are English teachers, so they
know what a simile is. Both of these practices waste time and result in lower scores.
 Each essay gets two readings by two different graders. Each grader assigns a number.
The two essay grades are averaged, and averages that end in 0.5 are rounded up. If the
numbers are more than two apart (one reader awards a 5 and the other awards an 8,
for example), a College Board expert steps in to render a final judgment. Essays good
enough to receive a 9 — the highest grade possible — are cause for celebration and
comments, such as “you have to read this one” and “here’s the next Shakespeare.” In fact,
the other graders usually pause to read the essay worthy of a 9 — even though they’ve
already read a zillion other essays and are propping their eyelids open with toothpicks.

Chapter 1: Flying Over the AP Lit Exam: An Overview

The envelope, please! Your final score
The multiple-choice and essay scores meet for a drink and . . . sorry, I got carried away with
the romance of it all. The scores from each part of the test are weighted so that the multiple-
choice counts for 45 percent of your final score and the essays for 55 percent.
Then the statisticians use complicated formulas to convert the multiple-choice and essay
scores into a number from 1–5. (I’ve supplied a version of this formula, adapted to the prac-
tice exams in this book, in Chapters 17 and 19.) These numbers, according to the College
Board, mean the following:
5 = extremely well qualified (equivalent to an A in a college course)
4 = well qualified (in the B range in a college course)
3 = qualified (a C in a college course)
2 = possibly qualified (a D in a college course)
1 = no recommendation (a failing grade)
As you can probably figure out, colleges don’t give you credit for a 1 or a 2. Even a score of 3
is iffy — some colleges are okay with it, and others aren’t. Some colleges award credit for
entry-level courses to those who scored four or five, and others bump you to a higher-level
course if you’re in that winning category. If you’re unsure about your prospective school’s
requirements, ask its admissions office.
Receiving your score
The minute I take a test I want to know how I’ve done, and I assume you feel the same way.
When you take the AP English exam, you have to wait a bit. The exam graders need time to
plow through your superlative literary essays. They don’t need too long, though. You take
the test in May, and in July the College Board mails your grade to you, to your high school,
and to the college of your choice. The first college report is free; if you want more than one,
you have to pay a fee. That fee is currently $15 — or $25 if you’re in a huge hurry and want
expedited service. You can also get your grade over the phone at the beginning of July for a
steep $8 a call.
Here are some important tips to keep in mind:
 If you had a headache, a breakup, or a crackup on the day of the exam, you can ask the
College Board to cancel your score, in which case it disappears forever. (Go to www.
collegeboard.com for instructions on how to cancel a score. Or, speak with your
school’s AP coordinator.) You have to make your request by mid-June, and you never
get to see your score. You don’t pay for score cancellation, but you aren’t reimbursed
for your exam fee either.
 If you want to withhold a score from a particular college, you pay about $10. Withheld
scores still go to your high school and to you, just not to a college. However, they don’t
disappear; your score can be sent to a college later if you change your mind — and, of
course, if you pay $15.
 You can take any AP exam more than once, though you have to wait an entire year to
do so because they’re given only in May. Both scores will be reported to your school
and to the college(s) you’ve selected. If your first score was pretty bad (say a 2), you
may want to withhold that score from prospective colleges.

For a fee (what else is new?) you can get your essay answer booklet back to review
with a teacher or tutor before you try the AP again. The booklet will have no teacher
comments on it, just a score. The deadline for this service is mid-September, and the
cost is currently $7.
Check out the College Board Web site (www.collegeboard.com) or call 888-225-5427 for
information, score reports, cancellations, and so forth.
Dealing with the Practical Stuff
If you’re taking an AP English course, your teacher will probably tell you everything you need
to do in order to sign up for the exam. However, if you’re home schooled or not in an AP
class (or if your English teacher has inhaled a little too much chalk dust), this section will
help you. Here I explain the practical aspects of the test, including registering, getting score
reports, fee waivers, accommodations for special needs, and so on. Because the AP exam has
stranger procedures than a super-secret spy agency, I also explain candidate packs, seals,
shrink wraps, and other annoying stuff so you won’t be surprised on test day.
Signing up
In the winter of the academic year in which you plan to take the exam, pick up a College
Board student bulletin. The College Board issues these pamphlets to give you the date of
the test, registration materials, deadlines, and information on fees. You can get the student
bulletin from your school’s AP Coordinator (who may be identified by the worried look
and hurried stride of someone who has way too much to do). In many schools, the AP
Coordinator is a college or guidance counselor. If you aren’t sure who has the student
bulletins, check with the principal or with your English teacher.
You can also find AP information, including a downloadable student bulletin, on the College
Board’s Web site, www.collegeboard.com/apstudents. You can’t sign up on line, but you
can find out where and how to register for the test. No Internet access? Not to worry. Call the
College Board at 888-225-5427 for registration information. As long as you’re on the Web site,
take a look at the practice exams and sample questions the test-writers provide.
AP exams aren’t cheap; currently you have to plunk down $83 for one test. You pay in
advance to the AP Coordinator at your school. You may also face extra fees if you want extra
score reports. (See the section “Receiving your score” earlier in this chapter for more details
on these extra fees.)
If the test fee is a stretch for your wallet, ask the AP Coordinator about reduced fees. In gen-
eral, the price drops to $53 for those in financial need. Sometimes the federal or state govern-
ment provides additional funds to defray the cost of the test.
If you aren’t currently attending a high school (you’re returning after time away or you’re
home-schooled), call the College Board AP Services no later than the end of February
(888-225-5427). They will put you in touch with the nearest AP Coordinator. Be sure to con-
tact the coordinator as soon as possible, and no later than mid-March. Tell the coordinator
that you want to take the AP English Literature and Composition exam, and notify him or her
of whether you have any special accommodations (more on accommodations later in this
chapter). The coordinator will give you a list of schools offering the AP English exam and will
17
Chapter 1: Flying Over the AP Lit Exam: An Overview

order an exam for you. The coordinator will also collect your fee and give you a code
number, which is different from the general number used by students attending the school
where the test is given. Be sure to bring a government-issued photo ID (passport, driver’s
license, or a similar official document) and your code number with you on test day. (See the
yellow tear-out card at the front of this book for a list of items to bring along on the big day.)
Being mindful of important deadlines
You can’t be late for a couple of very important dates in connection with the AP English
exam and still be sure that you have everything you need — permission to take the exam,
accommodation (if allowed), and so forth. Here are the basics:
 Early February: If you need accommodations on the exam (extra time, Braille or large-
type text, and so forth) and you haven’t yet been certified, need a change in certification,
or have changed schools, now is the time to submit documentation to the College Board.
 Late February: If you need accommodations and have been certified by your school
already, you still have to check that the correct forms have been sent to the College
Board. Ask your guidance counselor, principal, or AP coordinator whether the correct
forms have been mailed.
 Early March: If you’re a home-schooler or a student in a school that doesn’t offer the
AP program, you must contact the College Board for the name and phone number of an
AP Coordinator who can arrange the exam for you. Also, all test takers need to get a
government-issued photo ID. If you don’t have one, get one now.
 Beginning of April: If you’re enrolled in an AP English Lit course and you don’t need
accommodations, check with your teacher for the time and place of the exam. Find out
when the fee is due and determine which school official will collect it.
I can’t supply exact dates because they vary slightly from year to year. Check out www.
collegeboard.com/apstudents for more information. No Internet connection? Call
888-225-5427 for details.
Showing up: What to expect on test day
On test day, expect to have a nervous breakdown. Just kidding! If you’ve spent some quality
time with this book, you should be in great shape to do well on the exam. Here’s what to
expect.
Upon arrival
When you arrive at the test center, your teacher or a proctor (an adult who monitors the test)
will direct you to the correct room. You’ll be asked to leave everything in a locker or storage
area except for what you actually need for the test. (Check out the yellow tear-out sheet at
the beginning of this book for permitted items.) Usually exam-takers are asked to wait out-
side the testing room until the proctor is ready. Then you rush inside. Oops! I mean you
calmly, confidently stroll into the room. Allow about a half hour before the official start time
of the test for pre-exam visits to the restroom, locker room, padded room, and so forth.
In the classroom, before the exam
After you’re in the room, you have to be quiet. No last minute whispers about Emily Dickinson,
the Beatles, or the party next week. Any hint of cheating and you’re gone, so be careful to main-
tain silence and to limit your field of vision to the proctor, your watch, and the ceiling.
18
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

Before the exam begins, the proctor gives you a student pack. The student pack, also known
as the candidate pack, has bar-coded, self-stick labels that identify you and your test materi-
als. If you’re taking more than one AP exam, the proctor will take the student pack at the end
of every exam except the last, at which point you can take it home and frame it. Okay, well,
actually you use the ID number on that pack to get your scores over the phone. Don’t throw
it away until you know how you did.
The proctor also distributes answer sheets. At this point, you have to take an ID label from
your student pack and stick it on the answer sheet. Then you answer some easy questions,
such as your name, address, and so forth. (Some schools take care of these tasks ahead of
time, just to save test-day energy for the things that count. Others sweat you through it right
before the exam.)
At this time, the proctor will also distribute the exam, which is wrapped in clear plastic,
and he or she will read some legal notices. What these legal notices basically mean is that
when you open the plastic package you accept the College Board’s right to investigate if it
thinks you or anyone you know on this planet has cheated. You also give the College Board
the right to use your answers for any purpose it wants. No one will recite your essay on
American Idol, but your work may be used in one of the College Board’s publications as,
perhaps, a sample to train graders.
You’re getting closer to being ready to begin the exam, but you aren’t quite there yet. You
still need to copy the name of the test and the form number (it’s on the test booklet) onto
your answer sheet. You also have to read the legal stuff on the front and back covers of your
exam and then sign your name, indicating that you accept the terms. By accepting these
terms, you agree not to cheat, not to talk about the multiple-choice questions ever (they
reuse some), and not to divulge the essay questions for a few days.
During the exam
After you finish the multiple-choice section, you seal the question booklet with little stickers
that are in your student pack. The proctor then collects the question booklets and answer
sheets, and you get a ten-minute break (during which you’re pretty much in solitary confine-
ment, though you can sprint for a bathroom if necessary). You aren’t allowed phone calls or
conversation about the questions.
During the second part of the exam, you return and open the next plastic-wrapped package.
This pack contains a green question sheet and a pink answer sheet. Now you get to listen to
all the legal stuff again, write your name and stick a few more bar-coded labels on the book-
lets, and then compose your essays. Two hours later, you hand in the whole thing and begin
to breathe again. You’re done!
Life happens: What to do if you can’t take the exam
If you wind up sick on test day, chances are good that nothing terrible will happen if you
can’t take the exam. If you have the sniffles or a once-in-a-lifetime chance to play in the state
championship softball game, simply tell your AP Coordinator. He or she will arrange for an
exam during the makeup week, which is the first week following the usual AP period — in
other words, around the third week in May. If you’re out for more than that (you couldn’t
make bail, fell terribly ill, or got stranded on an island with polar bears and mysterious
hatches), you’re out of luck. You have to wait until next year, and you have to pay the fee all
over again.
Before you give up, however, check with your AP Coordinator. He or she may be able to
arrange a last-minute accommodation (perhaps extra time for someone with a sprained
wrist) that will save the day.
19
Chapter 1: Flying Over the AP Lit Exam: An Overview

Dealing with special needs
Students with special needs can take the AP English exam, and many do. Depending on your
situation, you may be entitled to extra time, a computer (for those with dysgraphia, which is
an impairment that causes you not to be able to write), large-type or Braille exams, a reader
for the questions, or a writer to take down your answers.
If you need accommodations, the AP Coordinator in your high school should take care of
everything; home-schoolers or those not enrolled in a school that has an AP program can get
help from the AP Coordinator in their area. (See the earlier section, “Signing up,” for more
information on finding an AP Coordinator.) The College Board’s Services for Students with
Disabilities Office is another good resource. Contact the office at 609-771-7137 (TTY
609-882-4118). You can also e-mail the office at ssd@collegeboard.org. Or, check the Web
site for more information (www.collegeboard.com/ssd/student/index.html).
The school has to fill out and submit a “Services for Students with Disabilities Eligibility” form,
affectionately known as the SSDE. In general, after the College Board has certified you as
needing accommodations on one of its exams (the SAT, for example), you’re certified for all.
However, if anything changes — your address, your school, your physical or mental ability —
you need a new form.
The school has to do the work here, but you’re the one who’s ultimately responsible for
making sure that the SSDE is in proper shape, in the proper hands, at the proper time. The
deadlines are in February or March before the exam, with the earlier date for students who
are being certified for the first time and the later date for those who have been through the
ordeal before. Check with your AP Coordinator well before that time to be sure everything’s
in order and to find out the exact dates.

Chapter 2
“The Readiness Is All”: 
Preparing for the Exam
In This Chapter
 Creating a schedule for test preparation
 Making good use of your time during the exam
W
illiam Shakespeare was a pretty smart guy. Consider, for example, the quotation in
the title of this chapter, a comment Hamlet makes when warned about a potentially
fatal fencing match. The AP English Literature and Composition exam has never, as far as I
know, done anything worse than provoke a few migraines and some nervous stomachs.
Nevertheless, as old Will wrote, “The readiness is all.”
This chapter is all about scheduling. It provides a countdown for the “I’m still in kindergarten
but I’ve got a retirement plan” types as well as for those who scratch their heads and ask,
“Oh, the test is tomorrow? Really?”
Many roads lead to Rome, according to the old saying, and many plans take you straight to
a five — the top score — on the AP exam. The schedule that I lay out in this chapter is just a
starting point. AP exams are given in early May; the date varies slightly from year to year.
Look at a calendar to find out when the exam is, and then look at your calendar. See where
you jump in. After you pick a spot — say, “September Preceding the Exam” — read all the
sections after that one for helpful suggestions taking you all the way to the morning of the
exam. Because the theme of this chapter is “it’s all in the timing,” I also throw in a section
showing you how to hit warp speed on the AP exam without sacrificing quality.
You can prepare for and take the AP English exam even if you aren’t in an AP English class.
Chances are your English or language arts class is laying a strong foundation of reading and
writing skills. If it isn’t and you still want to take the exam, fill the gap with some help from
Chapter 3, which explains how to strengthen reading comprehension and essay writing.
Chapter 3 can also help you with some of the many tasks that I suggest in this chapter,
such as planning your summer reading, annotating the texts that you read, starting a reading
notebook, and working on your vocabulary. Take the time to peruse Chapter 3 when you’re
tackling these helpful tasks.
When it comes to test preparation, one size doesn’t fit all. Tailor the schedule to fit your
learning style, your strengths and weaknesses, and your own particular daily grind.

Exam Minus One Year
Just so you know: Everyone who’s beginning AP exam prep at the last minute hates you. But
don’t pay them any mind. Instead, congratulate yourself. You’re in great shape if you have a
whole year to prepare for the AP English Literature and Composition exam. Here’s what you
need to do now:
 Confer with your English teacher or with a guidance counselor about whether you
should sign up for an AP English Literature course. (See Chapter 1 for more information
about these courses.)
 Plan some quality summer reading. (Appendix A has a list of great works of literature.)
 Annotate the books you read and begin keeping a reader’s notebook.
 Work on improving your vocabulary so that you’re prepared to decode the difficult
reading passages on the exam. I’m talking about regular words that people actually use,
not the terminology that English teachers throw around. Learning those words is help-
ful too, but those terms aren’t crucial to the AP exam.
 Gather and file corrected papers and notes from your most recent English classes.
When you have a moment — okay, a nanosecond, given your busy schedule — look
through the file and assess your work. You may discover areas to work on — thesis
statements or evidence, for example. Focus your energy on improving those skills.
I know you’re a paragon of organization, but I have one more task for you: Have some fun!
The summer’s a good time to get a head start on academics, but it’s also a good time. Period.
End of story. Take advantage of it.
September Preceding the Exam
Because you’re starting your AP preparations post–Labor Day, you obviously can’t take on
any summer reading (see the preceding section). But you still have a ton of time for some
great pre-exam preparation. Here are the most important tasks you should take care of 
right now:
 If you haven’t done so already, work on your vocabulary. The literature you read in AP
English classes and on the exam is filled with tough vocabulary, so increasing your
fund of words is a good strategy. You can also pick up some literary terminology,
though those words play a minimal role on the exam.
 Annotate the literary works you read, and continue or start a reader’s notebook.
 Start or add to a file of your writing assignments and tests from current and previous
English classes. From time to time browse through the file to see where your strengths
and weaknesses lie. This file also helps you remember details about works you’ve read —
a plus for the open-ended AP essay that allows you to choose what to write about.
 Keep a notebook or computer file of important points from the teacher and from student
discussions in your current English class.
 Read one critical essay about every major work that you’re currently studying in
English class, preferably just after you’ve completed the class-unit on the work. Don’t
let the critics’ views overpower your own interpretation. As you read a critical essay,
argue with “the expert” and assert your own ideas. Your own response, if you can sup-
port it with evidence from the text, is valid.
22
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

The first half of the school year can short-circuit fairly easily. After all you’re still figuring out
what each teacher wants from you — and that’s always a stressful task. (How do you deter-
mine the teacher’s non-negotiables? Read his or her handouts and listen to the assignments.
Note key words such as “must include” or “will not be accepted if.”) If you’re a senior, you’re
also probably obsessing over college applications. Take a deep breath each morning, face the
mirror, and say, “All I can do is my best.” That attitude is good for your blood pressure and
also for your grades. You can’t prepare for the AP English exam or do anything else properly
if you’re sizzling with tension.
January Preceding the Exam
January through March is a calmer portion of the academic year. By now you know your
teachers, and you probably have the lunch-table politics under control. And at last, seniors
have sent in all those angst-laden envelopes stuffed with college applications. Now you can
focus on enjoying yourself a little while you prepare for the AP exam (and don’t forget that I
said a little).
Once the New Year’s champagne goes flat, though, the AP test seems a lot more real; at this
point, you have a bit more than four months until the exam. Now’s the time to buckle down
and do some serious exam prep, including the following:
 Start or continue with the steps listed in the earlier section, “September Preceding the
Exam.”
 Set aside 30–45 minutes each week to read a chapter in Parts II through IV of this book.
If you’re unfamiliar with the exam format, turn to Chapter 1.
 Go through your tests, quizzes, and papers from your current and previous English
classes. Study the teachers’ comments and note where you lost points. Doing so helps
you figure out which skills you need to improve, and then you can carefully review the
chapters in this book that explain those points.
 If you aren’t sure what you need, take the practice exam in Chapter 16 and score it with
Chapter 17. Analyze your weaknesses and hit the corresponding chapters in this book.
23
Chapter 2: “The Readiness Is All”: Preparing for the Exam
Taking up speed-reading
When I was in high school, the dumbest thing I had on
my schedule (or so I thought at the time) was a three-
week course in speed-reading. Decades later I under-
stand that the ability to read fast is one of the best things
I ever learned. Why? Because no matter how hard I try,
I can’t seem to break the space-time continuum and
squeeze five extra hours into the day. Without speed-
reading, I’d never be able to get through all those stu-
dent papers, not to mention the boring faculty memos
that clutter my inbox.
With a minimum of effort you can read more quickly as
well. Think of yourself as an athlete, with your sport
being reading. When athletes are preparing for a race,
they build stamina by logging a certain number of miles.
Similarly, you “log miles” simply by reading a lot. But run-
ners also do wind-sprints when they train — short bursts
of the fastest pace they can manage. A reading wind-
sprint occurs when, for a few minutes, you consciously
zoom as quickly as possible down the page, without
passing the point where the words become meaning-
less. If you do one literary wind-sprint per day, after a
few weeks your reading speed will increase. Fast read-
ing is a great advantage on the AP exam because time is
very tight. Besides, after the AP exam, you can go to col-
lege and sprint through your homework, leaving you
much more time for . . . well, I’ll let you fill in that blank.

March Preceding the Exam
Spring break is a great time to catch up — with your social life and with AP test prep. As you
near exam day, you can probably glimpse the light at the end of the tunnel. Don’t worry: It
isn’t a train! You still have about two months to ready yourself for the exam; schedule an
hour or so a day of “AP” time and enjoy the rest. Here are some tasks you need to stay on top
of during this month:
 Start on or continue with the steps that I list in the previous sections.
 If you haven’t already done so, take the practice exam in Chapter 16 and score it with
Chapter 17. Go over any topics that tripped you up.
 Select and answer practice questions from the chapters addressing areas that worry
you (poetry, perhaps, or the open-ended essay).
 Seek out the help of a friendly English teacher (that’s all of us!) who can read one of
your practice essays and point out where you need to improve. Zoom through the table
of contents or the index to find sections in this book that address your weak spots.
Two Weeks before the Exam
All you long-rangers (those who started preparing a couple of months ago) can now lighten
up. Try not to brag about your foresight to anyone who’s beginning exam preparations at
this point. They’ll put toads in your locker or find some other way to express the overwhelm-
ing envy that they feel.
On the other hand, if you’re parachuting in at this point, you’re in damage-control mode
because 14 days for AP prep isn’t a lot. Drop everything from your social and academic life
that isn’t crucial. I don’t mean for you to skip your brother’s wedding or the history paper
that’s required to pass the course. But you should probably decline that tempting invitation to
your grandmother’s Ultimate Frisbee tournament. And it would help to ease up on the trips to
the mall or the paintball arena. You need to replace all this extra time with the following tasks:
 Review your class notes and papers on works you read in junior- or senior-level English
classes and skim through your reader’s notebook. The goal is to prepare four that are
suitable for the open-ended essay. (Chapter 14 explains how to choose works and what
you should know about each one.)
 Take the practice exam in either Chapter 16 or Chapter 18. For early birds, this is your
second round. For panic-planners, this is round one. You can score the exams with
Chapter 17 (for the exam in Chapter 16) or Chapter 19 (for the exam in Chapter 18).
 After taking the practice exam, make a list of things you have to watch out for. For
example, if you know that your essays seldom include enough support for your ideas,
put “evidence” on your “watch out” list. The simple act of writing this list will focus
your energy and help you remember what you need to do on exam day.
 Check out the later section “General Strategies for Saving Time on the Exam” for last
minute reminders on cramming four hours’ worth of thought into a three-hour test
period.
 Log on to www.collegeboard.com, register (it’s free!), and click on the AP English
Literature and Composition section. There you see recent essay questions and sample
responses.
24
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

 Locate everything you need for the exam, including a supply of No. 2 pencils, pens with
dark blue or black ink, photo identification, and an accommodation letter for special
needs. (I explain how to qualify for accommodations in Chapter 1.) Store everything in
one place.
 Determine how you will travel to the exam — school bus, family car, taxi, dog sled.
 If you’re taking the exam in a place that you aren’t familiar with, consider making a trip to
map out the route from your home to the test site. Nothing is worse than getting lost on
exam day (except maybe if you allot too little time for the journey to the testing center!).
Life being what it is, no matter how closely you follow the preceding suggestions, last-minute
disasters still occur. Be ready for them! For instance, find an alternate route to the test site
just in case the Highway Construction Authority decides that AP morning is a great time to
tear up asphalt on your primary route. And be sure that the dog, cat, piranha, or other house-
hold pet can’t get to your exam gear. (Can’t you just picture yourself explaining that the shred-
ded driver’s license really is your own, even though half the photo is now inside Fido’s belly?)
The Night before the Exam
If you just opened this book for the first time, go to Chapter 1 immediately. Read about the
format of the exam, and then turn to Chapter 16 or Chapter 18 for a practice exam. Don’t do
all the questions. Instead, hit the multiple-choice questions for one selection and check your
answers (in either Chapter 17 or Chapter 19). Then write one essay from either practice
exam and read the sample answers and criteria for grading. After grading your answers,
make a “watch out” list that includes the errors that show up most frequently, as well as the
correct answers. Then go on to the following list of tasks.
If you’ve been preparing for a while, you’re almost home free. You just need to take care of a
few more last-minute tasks:
 Read your “watch out” list and then stop studying. Anything you do now will only make
you more nervous.
 Do something that’s relaxing but not too strenuous. An hour or two of television, a chat
with a friend (who isn’t taking the exam), or an easy game of basketball are all good
activities. Cleaning out the attic, partying all night, and playing high-stakes poker aren’t
the best choices.
 After making sure that you have everything you need for the exam packed and ready,
(see the preceding section for a list) and after unearthing your car keys or rechecking
your travel arrangements, go to bed early. Set your alarm clock so that you won’t have
to rush in the morning. Sweet dreams!
Zero Hour: The Morning of the Test
Hamlet says, “If it be now, ‘tis not to come.” Although William Shakespeare himself never
took an AP exam, he obviously understood that one advantage of facing something horrible
(and three hours of testing certainly places the AP test in that category) is that at least you
can stop agonizing about it. On exam day morning, check out these tips for gliding smoothly
through your day:
 Get up early enough so that you don’t have to rush.
 Wear comfortable clothing. Layers are a good idea because you never know how warm
or cool the test room will be.
25
Chapter 2: “The Readiness Is All”: Preparing for the Exam

 Leave anything that you can’t bring into the test at home or in the car, which is pretty
much everything not required in the exam room, including electronic devices, bever-
ages, papers, and books. (And make sure that you bring everything you need! See the
earlier section, “Two Weeks before the Exam” and Chapter 1 for details.)
 Eat a real breakfast, even if you usually (gasp!) skip this all-important meal. Go heavy
on the protein (eggs, cheese, tofu, meat, and the like). Avoid sugary stuff, such as
doughnuts, pastries, and pancakes, because sugar gives you a spike of energy and then
a huge drop — which will likely be right around the middle of the exam.
 If you have time, skim your notes on the four works that you may write about for the
open-ended essay. (Check out Chapter 14 for details on selecting and preparing those
works.)
 To avoid nerves as much as possible, resolve to avoid fellow exam sufferers when you
arrive at the testing site. If you’re carpooling, make a strong effort to talk about base-
ball, who should have won American Idol, and any other non-test-related topics. Any
discussion of the exam at this point will only rev up your nervous system, which is
probably in high gear already.
 When you walk into the test room, choose a seat (if you’re allowed) with a good view
of the clock. However, if someone’s coughing, sniffling, burping, or otherwise making
annoying sounds, be sure to head for the other side of the room. Distractions will not
help you now.
 After you’re in your exam seat, indulge in a little desk yoga. Raise and lower your shoul-
ders a couple of times. Wiggle your feet. With your eyes closed, roll your neck in a
circle. Breathe deeply and feel your tension melt away. Tell yourself that you’re ready,
you’re set, and it’s time to produce your best test results ever.
Tucked into the legalese at the beginning of the test is the rule that you will not discuss the
multiple-choice questions at any time — during the exam, of course, but during the breaks
and even after the exam is over. Nor may you divulge the essay topics for a specified period
(usually a few days). The College Board is serious about security, and you should be too. If
you blab, the College Board may cancel your score.
General Strategies for Saving Time on the Exam
I’ve placed exam-strategy instructions throughout this book near relevant topics. For exam-
ple, I show you how to approach the poetry multiple-choice questions in Chapter 6, which is
devoted to that sort of question. But for now, here’s a lightning round of general strategy
points about saving time when it counts the most, during the exam itself.
Zooming through multiple-choice questions
The multiple-choice section asks you to read five or six passages or poems and answer
approximately 55 questions in 60 minutes. You don’t have to be a mathematician to figure out
that you need to hurry! Fortunately, a few time-saving techniques go a long way. For example,
be sure to do the following:
 Maximize your point total by concentrating on the genre that you know the most
about. For instance, tackle the poetry questions if that’s your thing or the drama set
if you’re a theater fan. Remember: You don’t have to do the questions in order!
Concentrating on what you do well increases the odds of answering correctly.
26
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

 If you read a passage that totally confuses you, skip the whole question set, regard-
less of genre. The torturers (oops, I mean the exam writers) don’t expect you to
answer every question. You can receive a five on the AP English exam without complet-
ing all the multiple-choice questions (because you don’t lose points for unanswered
questions). You can always go back to that passage if time permits. If you skip a ques-
tion, circle it in the test booklet so you can quickly locate it later.
Especially when you skip questions, be sure that you record your answers in the correct
answer bubbles. Remember that if you omit a question — but not a row of answers —
every succeeding answer will be wrong. (Makes your stomach flip-flop just contemplat-
ing that possibility, doesn’t it?) To avoid this nightmare, I recommend saying — with
your internal, noiseless voice — something like “I’m answering question 2, and this is
answer-slot 2” as you darken each oval.
 While reading a poem or passage, use the margin to jot down a word or two, noting
what’s going on at that spot in the selection. However, don’t write too much. Write
just enough to orient yourself when it’s time to answer the questions. Check out 
Figure 2-1 for a sample of these notes.
 Mark a slash through the obvious wrong answers in the test booklet right away. By
doing so, you allow yourself to concentrate on the two or three answers that may be
correct.
Speed-writing the essays
So many words, so little time. On the AP English exam, you have two measly hours to write
three essays. It doesn’t sound like much, does it? But when you think about it, you’re really
probably used to this pace. Sure, when you write a paper for English class the teacher may
give you a week or so to write, but we all know that the time period soon evaporates when
you subtract band practice, calculus homework, the cross-country meet, your Grandma
Ethel’s 80th birthday party, and all your other obligations. Thus you may have already mas-
tered a method for gathering your thoughts, putting them in order, and writing them down in
the shortest amount of time possible. If not, here’s a good way to divide the 40 minutes rec-
ommended for each essay. Just remember that the best essays come from planning, writing,
and revising.
The planning stage: The first 5 to 10 minutes
When beginning an AP essay, instinct probably tells you to grab your pen and begin writing
immediately. Bad idea. You should prepare for a couple of minutes first. To do so, follow
these steps:
1. Read the prompt carefully.
Prompts — the two- or three-sentence questions that you have to answer by writing an
essay — seem perfect for skim-reading, particularly when you’re under time pressure.
But that definitely isn’t the case! Here’s why: I can’t tell you how many great essays I’ve
read that reveal an understanding of the literary work, a good grasp of writing tech-
nique, and a complete misreading of the question. Sadly, this situation is the only one
(other than turning in a completely blank sheet of paper) that merits a zero on the AP
exam. Your classroom teacher knows and loves you and therefore may give you some
credit for an essay that ignores the question. But not the exam graders! Instead of
sprinting through a prompt, slow down.

Chapter 2: “The Readiness Is All”: Preparing for the Exam

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of 
having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister 
was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ëand what is the use 
of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversation?’
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day 
made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a 
daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, 
when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very 
much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall 
be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she 
ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but 
when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at 
it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind 
that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a 
watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after 
it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under 
the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the 
world she was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped 
suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about 
stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of 
time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to 
happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming 
to, but it was too dark to see anything, then she looked at the sides of the well, 
and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and 
there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from 
one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but 
to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for 
fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she 
fell past it.
‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of 
tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t 
say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very 
likely true.)
Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many 
miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere 
near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles 
down, I think —’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her 
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity 
for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was 
good practice to say it over) ‘— yes, that's about the right distance — but then 
I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what 
Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to 
say.)

2. Read the literary work, or think about it, with the question in mind.
You may be working from a poem or a prose or drama passage provided on the exam.
(Two of the three essays on the AP exam fall into this category). If so, read the literary
selection, underlining anything that seems relevant to the prompt and noting your
ideas in the margin. (Figure 2-1 is an example of an annotated selection.) If you’re work-
ing from memory (as you do in the third, open-ended essay on the AP exam), jot down
everything that comes to mind when you think of the question. Go through your notes
for a minute or so until you know what you want to write.
3. Create a thesis statement and locate evidence.
A thesis is the main idea of your essay. It’s the statement you’ll prove with evidence
from the literary work you’re writing about. AP thesis statements work from the
prompt, adding the original idea that “answers” the question posed by the prompt.
(Chapter 3 explains in detail how to create a thesis statement.) Once you know what
you’re proving, go back to the literary selection and select portions that support the
case you’re going to make.
4. Group your notes into subtopics.
When you’re grouping “like” things together, don’t rewrite anything; you have no time
to waste! Instead, simply draw circles around similar ideas or connect them with
arrows. Take a peek at Figure 2-2 for an example of notes that have been grouped into
subtopics. The question for this grouping concerns the characterization of the title
character of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland. The selection on which these notes
are based is shown in Figure 2-1.
5. Place the subtopics in order.
Sometimes the order of your subtopics doesn’t matter. But other times you’ll find that
one subtopic may lead to another in a logical progression. Again, don’t waste time writ-
ing a formal outline. Instead, just label your groupings #1, #2, #3, and so on. Check out
Figure 2-2 for an example.
Chapter 3 can help guide you through each of these steps in further detail, so be sure to give
it a read through before you take the exam.

Chapter 2: “The Readiness Is All”: Preparing for the Exam

Fleshing out your ideas in complete sentences: The next 25 to 28 minutes
Now, of course, you write the essay. Introduce the thesis and your supporting points in one or
two sentences. Next take each supporting point in turn, inserting evidence that makes an air-
tight case for your ideas. Hop right along from one brilliant idea to another. Because you have
little time, you want to make every word count. Don’t waste time repeating yourself or making
general statements that have nothing to do with the point that you’re trying to make. Also, be
sure that your final product is legible. No matter how brilliant you are, if the graders need an
electron microscope to decode your handwriting, you’re at a disadvantage. (Chapter 3 goes
into detail on essay structure, topic sentences, and all sorts of things you need to know about
writing an essay.)
When you’re preparing to write, you can save time by abbreviating character’s names (A for
“Alice,” for example) and by using shorthand (w/o for “without” or & for “and”). However,
when you’re actually writing an essay in the AP exam booklet, be sure to stay away from
abbreviations or other shortcuts. Especially avoid IM-speak (and I mean avoid it like the
plague). It isn’t that exam graders (a.k.a. English teachers) are in the dark ages in terms of
technology. It’s more that they loathe sentences such as “BTW, she 8 early.” They much
prefer “By the way, she ate early.”
Reviewing and polishing: The last 2 to 3 minutes
If you’re good at math (or maybe even if you’re awful at it), you’ve probably figured out by
now that approximately 10 minutes of the recommended 40-minute essay is not devoted to
writing. Yup. So you need to reread the essay quickly, fixing spelling and other errors and
tucking in the last-minute ideas with a neat caret (^). All in all, you just want to polish it up so
that it shines bright for the exam graders.
Polishing, you say? Isn’t it enough that you got the thing on the paper? Actually, under exam
conditions it probably is enough. But if you have even two minutes to reread what you wrote,
you can catch some glaring errors that mar the essay. Look for spelling and grammar mis-
takes, omitted words (especially when you move from one page to the next), and missing
punctuation or capital letters. If you think of an extra, amazingly insightful idea that will
improve your essay, try to squeeze it in too. I guarantee you that the final product will be
better if you take the time to spruce it up. (Chapter 3 provides some tips for effective polish-
ing, and Appendix B provides a whirlwind tour through Grammarland.)
Unless you’re allowed to type the essay on a computer as an accommodation for a special
need, you can’t easily insert an extra word or sentence into your written essay. And, although
essay-graders are fairly good at deciphering bad handwriting, even they can’t grade what they
can’t read. If you insert a word, be sure to do so neatly. Write the inserted word(s) above the
line, and insert a caret (^) under the line, indicating where the extra material should go.

W
hen my son returned from his first semester at college, he went on and on about 
his wonderful English teacher. “He wants us to call him ‘Hank,’” my son said. After 
a couple of minutes I asked whether “Hank” wore a flannel shirt or an old suit jacket with
patches on the elbows. Surprised, my son replied, “Flannel shirt.” How did I know? Because
I’ve spent a lot of time in English classes.
You’ve probably spent enough time in English classes to recognize the basic teacher
wardrobe too. In fact, you’re probably enrolled in one right now. And whether your English
class has the designation “AP” attached to its name or not, you’re still preparing for the AP
English Literature and Composition exam. What you learn in the class is important not only
when you take the exam but also when you receive a grade.
This chapter explains how to make better use of the information you learn and how to do so
more efficiently with a few simple techniques for note taking and reading comprehension. I
also throw in some tips on vocabulary-building and speed-reading techniques, and I explain
where to find good literary essays as supplements to your reading and as models for your
writing. Finally, I outline an effective method for writing a literary essay, a task you face in
class as well as on the AP exam.
Preparing for Class, Solo-Style: Working 
on Reading Comprehension
When I close up shop for the night and toss my books into the corner (or fling them if it’s
been a bad day), I almost always read another book purely for relaxation. I’m aware of the
contradiction, but here’s the thing: I love great literature. When I dive into a well-written
book, I lose myself and my world. (Okay, I admit it. Sometimes I watch junk television. Come
on, I’m not perfect.)

I hope you love the books you’re reading for English class, but even if you don’t, you can get
more out of them — and maybe even like them better — if you approach them properly. Plus,
reading with the techniques that I explain in this section helps you score well when the AP
exam comes around.
Beach books — the kind you pick up for a page-turning, mind-numbing experience — are
wonderful because they require no effort at all. Quality literature, on the other hand, asks
you to invest some brainpower, and then it rewards you tenfold by stimulating your thoughts
and emotions. Don’t bother with the techniques in this section if you’re reading feather-
weight stuff. And don’t even consider writing about beach books on the AP exam. For help
distinguishing AP from non–AP exam material, turn to Chapter 14.
Decoding and interpreting literature
Let’s say that your mission (and you have to choose to accept it or get an F for missing
homework) is to read Chapter 38 of Great Assigned Novel. How should you proceed? By read-
ing Chapter 38? Yes — and no. Of course you have to read the chapter, but a quick once-over
isn’t enough. You have to crack open the chapter like a walnut shell and digest the good stuff
inside. The same is true if your homework is to read poetry. In this section, I take you
through some techniques for solo work, also known as homework reading.
Curl up with the book you have to read for homework (or the one you’re reading just
because you want to). Because reading literature is intertwined with writing, also take out a
pen or a highlighter. Don’t write in the book unless you own it, of course. If you’re reading a
library or a school-owned text, confine your comments to a notebook instead. Or, if you find
typing easier than writing by hand, power up your computer.
I prefer to take notes on a computer, but I don’t like to read with my laptop on my lap. Here’s
my solution: I keep a pad of sticky notes nearby. When I come to a section that I want to write
more than a few words about, I slap a sticky note on that spot. When I finish reading, I turn to
the sticky note and type my thoughts. The sticky notes can be reused, too. That way you
save some money and the planet at the same time.
Grasping content
Your simplest task when you’re reading is to figure out what’s happening. Specifically, you
should do the following:
 As you’re reading, keep a “reader’s notebook” containing thoughts and information
about the works you read. I said “notebook,” but if you’re more comfortable at the
computer, keep a “reader’s file.” Every time you read, use the reader’s notebook or 
file to record what’s going through your head. Jot down plot points (for a novel, play,
or story) and important ideas (for any type of literature). Take note of symbols and
conflicts. Reflect on the writer’s style. Argue with the author or copy out passages that
you love. Review your reader’s notebook before the AP English exam and whenever
you have a class assignment and need a writing idea. Check out Figure 3-1 for a sample
from a reader’s notebook. Can you spot some potential essay topics? The treatment of
an outsider comes to my mind as well as the symbolism of the conch.
Figure 3-4 later in this chapter contains a form that shows you how to record key facts
about a literary work. It resembles a page from a reader’s notebook, but it’s just a skele-
ton. If you’re really pressed for time, this form may substitute for a reader’s notebook.
However, if you can find the extra minutes to create a true reader’s notebook, I highly
suggest that you do so.
32
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

 Take notes that help you create a skeletal outline of the chapter. This technique 
is called annotation, and it’s illustrated in Figure 3-2. Don’t write too much. If you 
own the book, jot down a couple of words in the margin that summarize the content 
of each part. For example, you might write: “party scene,” “Gregor wakes up,” 
“boss visits,” and so forth. If you’re reading a poem, you may not find a narrative.
Nevertheless, you should still note a couple of key points in the margin (“lover’s
description” or “compass comparison,” for example). If you don’t own the book 
that you’re reading, list the page or line number and content summary in your 
reader’s notebook (“line 12: lover’s description” or “p. 21: compass symbol,” for 
example).
 If you’re confused at any point, highlight or underline the difficult section or make 
a note of the page in your reader’s notebook. It may also be helpful to put a couple 
of question marks to indicate that you’re puzzled. After all, by the time you finish 
reading you may forget why you highlighted or underlined the text! Go back to that 
section later, and try to decipher it with the context you’ve gleaned from the rest of 
the chapter. If you’re still at sea, ask the teacher or do a little research. (You can read
more on researching in “Hearing Out the Critics: Reading Literary Essays” later in this
chapter.)
 If you come to a word that you don’t know, underline it or write it in your notebook
and keep going. Don’t stop reading unless that one unknown word greatly hinders
your reading. Later you can use a dictionary to check the definition, or you can ask a
handy adult for help. (I explain this vocabulary-building technique in more detail later
in this chapter.)
The dictionary built into your word processing program is too limited for serious litera-
ture. Instead, consult a printed dictionary, such as Webster’s New World Dictionary, or
turn to a good online source, such as www.answers.com or the dictionaries of the
Internet Public Library (www.ipl.org).
Lord of the Flies by William Golding
I  just read the scene where Ralph meets Piggy for the first time. Piggyís really 
smart, but he’s annoying. He’s the one who says that they can use the conch to 
call a meeting. The conch seems important — maybe it’s a sign of unity? But 
Piggy says, “My auntie wouldn’t let me blow [the conch] on account of my 
asthma.” Piggy’s always sick, and he wouldn’t be much fun to hang out with. 
Piggy is outside the group. Maybe that’s why he can’t blow on the conch, 
because the conch is a symbol of the group getting together, and Piggy is 
excluded as much as possible from the group. Ralph tolerates Piggy, but when 
Jack and the choir boys arrive, Ralph says, “His real name’s Piggy.” He sells out 
Piggy to get on Jack’s good side. Now that they have a common enemy, Ralph 
and Jack are united. Poor Piggy — “even the tiniest child” joined in the 
laughter. Piggy’s used to this treatment; he ‘bowed his head’ when they 
laughed. Piggy protests, but in the end he can’t do anything, and Ralph just 
tells him that “Piggy” is better than “Fatty.”

Chapter 3: Getting the Most Out of English Class

Figures 3-2 and 3-3 are examples of annotated texts. In Figure 3-2, which shows an excerpt
from Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, notice that two vocabulary words, reverie and 
conjecture, are underlined. An asterisk and a question accompany a puzzling statement 
from Elizabeth (“Mr. Darcy is all politeness.”). Marginal notes keep track of what’s going on
(“Miss B. disses E,” for example). As you see, abbreviations are fine, and you don’t have to be
formal. I use “dis” as shorthand for “disrespects,” just as my students do. (Who said English
teachers weren’t hip?)
In Figure 3-3, showing an excerpt from John Keats’s “Ode on a Grecian Urn,” sensual and
unweariéd are questioned, the first for vocabulary and the second because of the accent. 
(In case you’re curious, the accent is there to add an extra syllable, keeping the rhythm 
uniform.) Another annotation in this sample asks why the “love” is “more happy.” Other 
marginal notes summarize ideas (for example, “unheard = better” and “talks to lover 
under tree”).
 
“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow 
me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot 
refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.” And, taking her 
hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, 
was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with 
some discomposure to Sir William:
 
“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to 
suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
 
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of 
her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all 
shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
 
“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me 
the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the 
amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one 
half–hour.”
 
“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
 
“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Eliza, we 
cannot wonder at his complaisance — for who would object to such a partner?”
 
“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
 
“I should imagine not.”
 
 
“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many 
evenings in this manner — in such society; and indeed I am quite of your 
opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise — the 
nothingness, and yet the self–importance of all those people! What would I 
give to hear your strictures on them!”
 
“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more 
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a 
pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”

Excavating the subtext
In great literature, all the action is below the surface. Therefore, it’s time to dig a little deeper
and explore the subtext, the ideas that fall beyond the literal, “this-is-what-happened” level.
Here’s a map to guide you while you’re underground in Literature Land:
 As you read, think about the themes. Themes are those ideas that the author’s explor-
ing. For example, in Moby-Dick Herman Melville isn’t simply describing a whale hunt.
He’s pondering the nature of obsession, the drive to succeed at one particular task
regardless of the cost. Here’s another example: In Antigone, Sophocles tells the story of
one woman’s refusal to obey the law. But Antigone’s defiance is the platform for
Sophocles’ consideration of the nature of power and the conflict between religion and
the state, among other themes.
When you finish reading, slip on the author’s shoes and walk a couple of steps. Can you
figure out what ideas the author is grappling with? Jot down a few notes on the possi-
ble themes.
 Underline or highlight any sentence or phrase that intrigues you, even if you don’t
know why, and then take a moment to free-associate about a keyword or about the
whole thing. When free-associating, write down what comes to mind when you see
these words or sentences. Don’t censor yourself. Just record everything that pops 
into your head. These random notes sometimes reveal themes or symbols, elements 
Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
 
Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
 
Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:
Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave
 
Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare;
 
 
Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, 
Though winning near the goal — yet, do not grieve;
 
She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss,
For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair!
Ah, happy, happy boughs! that cannot shed
 
Your leaves, nor ever bid the Spring adieu;
And, happy melodist, unwearièd.
 
For ever piping songs for ever new;
More happy love! more happy, happy love!

don’t deface it! Instead, write the page numbers in your reader’s notebook or use a
sticky note.
Free association is especially productive when you’re reading poetry. After all, poets
seldom come right at you. They “tell all the Truth but tell it slant,” as the great
American writer Emily Dickinson put it. Free association is often the fastest way into a
poem. (Check out Part II for more tips on decoding poetry.)
Go back over Figures 3-2 and 3-3 to see how themes are noted. In Figure 3-2, for example, the
notation “D.’s manners” relates to the theme of appearance as a substitute for reality. The
statement “Lucas thinks he knows how E. feels” relates to assumptions. Figure 3-3 contains
the phrase “frozen in time,” which is an important theme of the poem.
Recognizing style
Every writer has a style, even if it’s a bad one. When you’re reading good stuff, you should
check out how something is written. In fine literature, style works hand in hand with mean-
ing, quietly pushing the reader to a particular reaction. If you pay attention to style, as a
bonus, you pick up some writing techniques to apply to your own work. Here’s how you can
get better acquainted with style:
 Pay close attention to language. Zero in on any word or phrase that catches your eye.
These words and phrases may catch your eye because they’re different or, conversely,
because they’re typical of the work. Why did the author choose that word or phrase?
Would the effect be different if the author had substituted another?
 Reread your notes and take a moment to consider structure, (how the piece is
organized). Does the structure relate to the meaning or affect the way the reader 
perceives the work? Why did the writer choose a particular structure?
For example, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein has a “frame” around the main plot, which is
the creation of the “monster.” The book begins and ends with a desperate man telling
his story after having been rescued from an icy sea. The entire middle section of the
novel is that man’s story. The narrator of the “frame” echoes the desperation of the
creature brought to life by Dr. Frankenstein. Therefore, before the creature enters the
story, the reader is prepared.
 Consider sentence length and the amount of space or emphasis given to various
events or ideas. Ask yourself why one event is emphasized and another is downplayed.
For instance, in To the Lighthouse Virginia Woolf places many important events in
brackets. A major character’s death is reported in one bracketed sentence, but a
simple walk through town consumes ten pages. This style reinforces Woolf’s belief in
the importance of everyday life and the limitations of human perception of time.
 Think about how the writer employs various elements of fiction. Does the author use
a lot of dialogue or a ton of description? How do these elements change the way you
perceive the work?
 Look for figurative language, which is the term for imaginative, non-literal expres-
sion. Examples of figurative language include metaphors, similes, personification, and
symbolism. (Check out Chapter 4 for more on these devices.) What effect does figura-
tive language have on the meaning of the work or on the reader’s reaction?
36

 In a poem, notice how the lines appear on the page and how the words sound. If you
happen to be alone, read the poem aloud. (If you’re in the library or in a crowd, hear it
in your inner voice.) Examine the poetic techniques that the poet employs to achieve a
certain sound or form.
These tasks sound like a lot of work, but they represent a change, not a huge addition, to the
way you read. The few extra minutes they subtract from your life add a great deal of informa-
tion to your head. Try them and see!
Taking Notes in Class
Consider this situation: You’re in the middle of a heated discussion about a poem in class,
and then the teacher throws out a probing question. Half a dozen students weigh in with
their opinions. The comments zing around the room until the period is over. That’s when you
look down at your notebook; it’s completely empty. Have you been there and done that?
How about this scenario: The teacher asks you to open to a page of James Joyce’s A Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man. She then begins to talk about the symbols tucked into each sen-
tence. She’s excited about the literature, so she’s talking fast. You scribble word after word in
your notebook, but at the end of the period you have 15 pages of notes, none of which make
much sense. I’m guessing you’ve been in this situation too.
Okay, maybe I’m exaggerating a little, but most students have trouble with notetaking. They
write too much or too little, or they write just the right amount in such a disorganized fash-
ion that the information isn’t accessible. Yet as you know, it’s crucial to extract the important
points of each literature lesson and to record those points clearly.
The next time you’re discussing a work of literature or are studying it on your own, try these
strategies to make your notetaking more effective:
 Dedicate one notebook or loose-leaf section of your binder to English notes and
nothing but English notes. Once every week or so, photocopy your handwritten notes
and store them away from your notebook or binder. Then if you lose one copy, you
won’t come up empty when a test or a paper deadline looms. Having everything in one
place allows for quick and efficient review of important points.
If you prefer computers, create a file called “English notes.” Save the file, and don’t
forget to back it up every day. Computer crashes are the 21st century edition of “the
dog ate my homework.” In other words, your teacher will not be happy to hear that 
you need a deadline extension because something’s wrong with your computer’s 
hard drive.
 Concentrate only on identifying the most important ideas, not on everything the
teacher says. Don’t try to write down everything — even if you’re a speed-writer. A
word-for-word transcript is a waste of time and energy. If the teacher is lecturing, he or
she may emphasize certain words or write a phrase or two on the board. Copy those
words into your notebook. Then record a few of the comments that the teacher makes
about those words or phrases.
During a lecture or a discussion class, most people aren’t fast enough to catch every
important point. Therefore, when you’re taking notes on paper, always leave a large
37
Chapter 3: Getting the Most Out of English Class

margin. During your next free moment, dig into your memory bank or consult a friend
and add what you missed. (Computer files, of course, are infinitely expandable.)
 Whenever the teacher says something that puzzles you, ask for clarification. The
best sort of learning is interactive for the same reason that makes playing a video game
more fun than watching one. You need to be involved in order to engage your brain
fully. When you get an answer, record the main idea and leave extra blank space. Later,
fill in the details.
 Don’t ignore other students. If someone brings up a point that really makes you
think, write the key words, just as you do when the teacher is speaking. However, 
be sure to listen to the teacher’s response. For instance, if you hear “interesting point,
but . . .” you need to qualify the student’s comment and not accept it as wholly on
target. On the other hand, pay special attention to remarks greeted by “great point” or
“excellent idea.”
 To wring the most literary knowledge out of your English class, find a study-buddy
who’s willing to read your notebook while you read his or hers. Each of you can then
add the notes that you missed the first time around. A short follow-up to class discus-
sion with a study-buddy goes a long way toward increasing your knowledge of English
literature. Two heads are always better than one!
Good notetaking doesn’t just help you study for tests. It also helps you with your class
essays. You probably have a hefty number of writing assignments to complete if you’re at the
AP level, and those assignments will be easier if you keep good notes. The notes provide fac-
tual information for your essays. Also, if the assignment requires you to come up with your
own topic, your notes may be a goldmine of ideas.
Reading the Extra Mile: Beyond 
Course Assignments
You’re probably already reading a pile of assigned texts that’s several inches thick, so it’s
pretty daring of me to suggest that you read even more. Consider this section a lit-lover’s
“dare-to-dream” moment, because I’m going to propose that you find a couple of poems a
week or one book a month that you read just for fun. Fun? Fun? I can hear your teeth grind-
ing. But the fact is that if you pick something you like, reading it actually will be fun. And if
you choose something you like that’s also of good literary quality, you can prepare for the AP
English exam without grinding even one tooth. (Chapter 14 includes standards for determin-
ing “good literary quality,” and Appendix A gives you a list of great works that you can con-
sider reading.)
After all that fun, keep the literary work fresh in your mind by recording a few facts about 
the work. You can use a form for all of your readings. Check out Figure 3-4 for a completed
sample form on Lord of the Flies. You can fill out such a form for each extra poem or book
you read. They’ll serve as a sort of deposit slip for your memory bank. (A blank form, suit-
able for photocopying, is on the back of the yellow tear-out card at the front of this book.) As
the AP exam nears, go through the forms and select a few works that you would feel comfort-
able writing about in the open-ended essay. Review those forms extra carefully. (Chapter 14
tells you everything you need to know about the open-ended essay.)

Hearing Out the Critics: Reading 
Literary Essays
Despite your best efforts, you may still be confused by what you’re reading for an AP English
class. The works of some of the very best writers, I have to admit, aren’t particularly easy to
figure out the first time you encounter them. I also have to admit that not every teacher is
crystal clear all the time. And even if you have your own interpretation of a work, you may
want to compare your thoughts to those of a literary scholar. Therefore, you should read
some critical essays, also known as “literary criticism,” on those works that you study.

Using criticism correctly, as a 
supplement to your reading
Literary criticism is essentially the printed version of the lectures or arguments you hear 
in English class. Studying literary criticism is most helpful after you’ve finished reading the
work itself. Why? If you read the critics first, your response to the author’s words is blunted
by someone else’s reaction. Your chance to see the work from a different angle may be lost.
Needless to say, you should never consider reading about the literary work as a substitute
for reading the work itself. Yes, plot summaries and interpretations exist on the Internet, in
bookstores, and in libraries. But these tools have their place, and that place is following your
completely thoughtful reading of the literature. Use these summaries and character lists to
help you remember or to clarify confusing points. See literary criticism as an aid, a supple-
ment to your own thoughts.
Guess what? Reading literary essays has an added benefit: A quality piece of writing may
serve as a model for your own work. Of course, some critics are better than others, both in
interpreting and writing about literature. But if you turn to a good source, you can probably
pick up some pointers. In fact, a bit of the critic’s style may rub off on your own prose. At the
very least, you’ll know what you’re aiming for.
After you read a literary essay, compare the author’s ideas to your own. Do you agree with
everything he or she says? If not, why not? Don’t give up on your own ideas too quickly. If
you hang out in the literary criticism world for a while, you discover that even the most
learned scholars fight with each other over the meaning of a line or over an entire work. 
Join the battle by testing your ideas against theirs.
With all this talk of using other people’s work as a guide, let me throw out this warning:
Plagiarism is one of the worst offenses in the academic world (and, well, it’s pretty bad in the
real world too). The word is derived from a Latin word for “kidnapping.” Literally, plagiarism
is kidnapping someone’s brainchild. I’m not exaggerating. When you’re writing a paper for
English class and you consult literary criticism in books or on the Internet, you must credit
the source if you use his or her idea. Otherwise you’re in big trouble, and you should be. If
you’re writing from memory — in a situation such as the AP exam — you probably won’t
remember where you found a particular idea. The graders understand this fact and therefore
don’t expect you to cite literary criticism. If you quote from a literary work provided on the
exam, however, they do want to see quotation marks and line numbers. I explain how to cite
works in Chapter 7 (poetry) and Chapter 12 (prose), both of which deal with writing essays.
Finding well-written criticism
After you’re convinced of the importance of studying literary criticism, the next issue you
have to tackle is where to find the best criticism. (Hint: You won’t find it in the communal try-
on room of your local clothing store. That’s where you hear criticism regarding whether that
purple-and-orange-striped bikini is really a good idea.) Try these sources:
 The “800” numbers of the Dewey Decimal System: This classification system is used
by nearly every library, so check the catalog in your school or public library. The
search term is the title or author of the work. You may find a whole book devoted to
the work that you’re reading, or you may stumble across a book of essays on various
works.
40
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

 Electronic databases: Some libraries subscribe to electronic databases to expand their
reference collection without building a bricks-and-mortar extension to the building. A
professional in the field generally screens the material before it’s accepted into the
electronic databases. Some good literary criticism can be found in the following elec-
tronic sources:
• Columbia Granger’s World of Poetry
• JStor
• Literature Resource Center
• ProQuest Learning
• Twayne’s Authors Series
 Critical editions: Some literary works are published in “critical editions,” which
include a literary work and a sampling of the most famous critical essays about the
work. The introduction or afterword of a literary text, which isn’t necessarily an official
literary essay, may also be a valuable source of ideas.
 The Internet: The Internet has some fine sites for literary criticism. Check out the
Internet Public Library at www.ipl.org. The stuff on the IPL site isn’t perfect, but
much of it has passed muster after being reviewed by reputable scholars. If you don’t
find what you’re looking for there, you can also try an all-purpose search engine, such
as Google. With the “advanced search” function, enter the title and author of the work
and the exact phrase “full text.” You may turn up some fine critical essays that way.
The minute you hit the Internet, you open yourself up to a million authors, some of
whom are wonderful scholars and some of whom are teens posting their homework
essays. I’m not trying to disparage the young folk, but they aren’t exactly the experts
you need. Always look at the Web address (the URL), and take a moment to evaluate
what you’re reading. If someone’s discussing “Mac Beth” and his wife, “Mrs. Beth,”
you’re in the wrong place. A good rule is to stay with sites that are sponsored by 
universities. Tip: To identify a university-sponsored site, look for “edu” in the Web
address.
If you run across any trouble with these literary criticism sources or you aren’t finding what
you’re looking for, be sure to consult your friendly librarian. They always love a good
research challenge and would be glad to help.
Building Vocabulary for Fun and Profit
Have you ever watched babies learn to talk? The little guys toddle around, pointing at every-
thing they see, asking the large creatures that supply food, diapers, and hugs to teach them
vocabulary lessons. And babies are so cute that anyone nearby immediately begins to coo,
“Tree. That’s a tree. Do you like the tree? Say hello to the tree,” and a bunch of silly sentences
like that.
Vocabulary building was simple in those days. It’s simple now, too, but different. You already
know the words you need to survive everyday life. Now you just have to learn the ones that
help you survive standardized tests. Granted, the AP English exam doesn’t include an official
“vocabulary section.” However, a few “vocabulary-in-context” questions pop up in the multiple-
choice section. (Flip to Chapter 1 for a sample “vocabulary-in-context” question.) A strong
vocabulary helps you understand the literary passages provided on the exam and gives you
a fund of words to pick from when you’re writing essays. Pretty good payoff for a wee bit 
of effort.
41
Chapter 3: Getting the Most Out of English Class

Happily, vocabulary building doesn’t have to be a big production. Just tweak the way you
read and, if you’re willing, add a bit of vocabulary study. At that point, the fund of words you
know will increase rapidly. Try these steps:
1. Underline or list unfamiliar words.
If you’re a reasonably good reader, you probably skip over words you don’t know when
you’re engrossed in a book. You do so because you’re looking for the main idea, and
you can usually grasp the meaning even if one or two words are strangers to you. Not a
bad technique, but a better way exists. Read with a pen and underline unfamiliar words
(if you own the book). You can also note them on scrap paper, indicating the page on
which you found them. Unless you’re completely at sea, don’t stop reading when you
find a word that puzzles you.
2. When you’re finished reading, write one of your unfamiliar words on an index card,
including the sentence or phrase in which the word appeared.
The context is crucial. Human beings don’t learn particularly well from lists. If you can
picture where you found a word and recreate its context, you have a much better
chance of remembering it.
3. Jot down the meaning of the word on the other side of the index card.
Be sure to select the definition of the word that fits the context of the sentence. You
can use a dictionary to figure out the appropriate meaning. If someone’s around who
might know the meaning (a teacher or a parent, perhaps), just ask. Their definitions are
just as good.
When you look up a word in the dictionary, you may find 20 or more meanings. Be sure
to select the definition that makes sense, given the meaning of the sentence or para-
graph in which the word appears. Otherwise your effort will be wasted.
4. Once a week, go through your index cards.
Read each word and the sentence you found it in. Try to remember the meaning. If you
can’t, turn the card over and check the definition.
5. Add to your index-card dictionary whenever you hear an unfamiliar word.
I learn new words all the time from television, radio, and movies. (Not all of them are
AP material, and some aren’t even printable in a family-friendly book. However, as an
English teacher, I’m always happy to expand my vocabulary.) If you hear an unfamiliar
word in the media or in class — any class, not just English — put it in your index-card
dictionary.
Hate index cards? Have handwriting that looks like a chicken walked through an ink puddle
and then onto your paper? No problem. You can do the vocabulary exercise described in the
preceding list on your PDA or on your computer. You obviously can’t put the meaning on the
other side of the card, because, well, you don’t have a card. However, you can number the
words and sentences. Number the definitions too, and place them at the bottom of the file.
When you go through your vocabulary file, quiz yourself. Then scroll down to check the
meaning.
The method described in this section may not be enough if vocabulary is really an issue for
you. In that case you may want to devote even more time to a systematic study. I recommend
Vocabulary For Dummies by Laurie Rozakis (Wiley, 2002).
Words have definitions, which are easy to find and memorize, but they also have connota-
tions, or extra baggage of attitude and emotion that they carry around. For example, 
“slender” and “emaciated” have similar dictionary meanings, but they have very different
connotations. Dieting to become slender is okay; moving on toward emaciated means you
need a doctor’s attention. Don’t throw a new vocabulary word into your AP essays (or into
your conversation, for that matter) until you’re sure of the word’s connotation. You pick up
connotations from context; every time you hear the word, note how it’s used.

Honing Your Essay-Writing Skills
AP essay writers usually are tripped up by four tasks:
 Getting all the words on the page before the time’s up
 Deciding what to write
 Constructing a sturdy framework to hold your ideas
 Writing with a mature style (what English teachers like to call a “command of language”)
In case you’re wondering whether the AP English exam has anything to do with real life, I’m
here to tell you that when I write a book, four things are difficult for me: getting all the words
to my editor before deadline, deciding what to write, creating a suitable structure, and writ-
ing with style. The AP English exam certainly has a lot to do with my real life.
In Chapter 2, I explain how to gather your thoughts and quickly put them on paper when
you’re under time pressure. This situation occurs during the school year when you’re writing
an essay in one class period or when essays are part of the tests that your English teacher
assigns you once a month or so. And of course, you have to produce three full-length essays
in two hours on the AP English exam. No pressure there.
In this section I tackle the other three issues — content, style, and structure — for essays
and English papers. Note: This section addresses essay-writing in general. For more detailed
suggestions about a specific genre, or type of literature, turn to Chapter 7 (poetry essays) or
Chapter 12 (prose and drama essays).
Deciding what to write
By the time you’re old enough to even think about taking the AP English exam, you’ve proba-
bly penned a zillion essays and papers. And I’m guessing that at least once in all that writing
you’ve hit the Wall. The Wall is tall, wide, and strong. It has question marks painted all over
it. Hence its official name: Writer’s Block. If your home address is on Writer’s Block, you’ve
got lots of company. However, you also have a way to move out. This section serves as your
moving van.
Writing assignments in English class may be sorted into two barrels:
 Assignments written in response to a specific question about a literary work. These
assignments are pretty straightforward (and sometimes downright stuffy!). The works
you may be asked to write about include poems, novels, stories, nonfiction works, or
plays.
 Essays you write when the teacher gives you more freedom. In this category, the
teacher may say the equivalent of “write anything you want,” or he or she may place
some limits (for example, “Write anything you want about A Tale of Two Cities” or
“Analyze how a character faces a moral dilemma in a literary work of your choice.”).
Surprisingly, both barrels require you to make some decisions — even the first one. For
instance, if you have a question and an assigned literary work, you still have to decode the
question and figure out what point you want to make, which is the thesis of your essay. If
you’re working on an open-ended assignment, the possibilities are infinite, and so obviously
you have to make some decisions to narrow them down.
43
Chapter 3: Getting the Most Out of English Class

When deciding what to write, you need a plan. Follow these steps:
1. Decipher what the prompt, or question, requires.
2. Narrow your focus.
3. Create a thesis statement.
4. Gather evidence from the literary work to support your ideas and arrange them as
subtopics under your thesis.
I explain each of these steps in the following sections. For specific instructions on selecting
evidence from literary works of each genre, turn to Chapter 7 (for poetry) and Chapter 12
(for prose and drama).
On the AP English Lit exam, you always work from a specific question, but sometimes you’re
given a passage or a poem to read, and sometimes you’re allowed to choose the literary
work. The information in the following sections helps you with both situations.
Scalpel, please! Dissecting an essay prompt
Half the battle in writing an essay in response to a specific question is figuring out what the
exam writers want from you. Prompts, the two- or three-sentence questions about literary
works, tell you what to do. (You may have some counter-suggestions for the College Board or
your teacher, but it’s probably better to keep them to yourself.) This section helps you deal
with the prompt, the all-important first step in writing a great AP-quality essay.
Follow these steps when dissecting your prompt:
1. Read the prompt carefully.
I can hear you now! You’re saying, “What does she think I’m going to do, write the
essay without reading the question?” But surprisingly, quite a few students read only
part of the prompt or slide over it too quickly for real understanding. Needless to say,
the resulting essay is a mess (and perhaps earns you nothing but a zero). Hence, I
repeat: Read the prompt.
2. Underline important words.
“The” doesn’t count. Look for literary terms (setting, metaphors, conflict, and so on).
Also check for the specific detail(s) you’re supposed to focus on — character, plot
point, theme, or whatever.
3. Restate the question.
Reduce the query to its simplest terms, as if a child were asking it. However, don’t
bother writing the restated question; just hear it in your head.
4. Write a couple of words to remind yourself of the focus.
Don’t spend a lot of time on this step. Even if you’re working at home, theoretically
without a time limit (you’ve decided to forgo eating, sleeping, and math in order to
maximize your English grade), you should keep written notes short and to the point.
Besides, you want to practice for the AP exam!
Time for some examples of this technique in action:
Prompt: After reading the following poem, explain in a well-organized essay how the
poet’s imagery conveys the complex attitude of the speaker toward her home.
Restated prompt: How does the speaker feel about her home? What do I see, hear, smell,
etc. in the poem that tells me how the speaker feels?
Notes: attitude of spkr → home, imagery
44
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

Now try another prompt:
Prompt: In a well-organized essay, explain the literary techniques Eleanor Howard uses
to contrast two stages of Oliver’s life, youth and old age, in her novel Against the Tide.
Restated prompt: What’s the difference between Oliver’s youth and old age? What liter-
ary techniques show the difference?
Notes: O’s youth/old age, lit tech → show difference
Narrowing your focus when you don’t have a prompt
If you’re allowed to write anything you want, an ocean of possibilities swamps you. You have
to turn that ocean into a small stream — one that’s easy to manage. In other words, you have
to narrow your focus. This section explains how to do so, by following these steps.
 Ask yourself what you don’t know about the text. Yes, I know this tactic runs counter
to your instinct to go with something you’re sure of. But writing is a form of thinking
that may help you discover something about the work. If you start with a puzzle and
note some possible interpretations, you generally come up with more original and 
creative ideas than a canned, “here’s-what-we-said-in-class” essay.
 Try a brain dump. For ten minutes or so, take everything in your head relating to the
assignment and pour it into your reader’s notebook. Don’t worry about paragraphs,
spelling, or grammar. Just pour. When you’re finished, reread what you wrote. You
probably have one or two ideas to work with. Now take another ten minutes to “brain
dump” about those possible ideas. Reread your writing. Chances are by now you have
a topic and some subtopics as well.
 Create a web of ideas. If you’re a visual person, forget about the lines on the paper. Jot
down the ideas in random spots on a sheet of paper. Next, connect those that seem to
belong together by enclosing them in a circle, square, or geometric figure of your
choice. Or use little lines and arrows to connect things. Don’t censor yourself, but do
try to stay on topic. After everything that comes to mind is on paper, you should have
at least one possible writing topic and several possible subtopics.
Creating a thesis statement
After you’ve decided what to write about — Iago’s jealousy, the identity of the “secret sharer”
in Joseph Conrad’s story by the same name, the figurative language of Gregory Corso’s poem
“Marriage,” for example — you’re almost at the starting line. But before you write the essay,
you still have to create a thesis statement and choose subtopics.
The thesis is the idea that you’re going to prove, and it’s written as one sentence. If you’re
working from a prompt, a good thesis may be a simple restatement of the question, with an
added bit of originality from you. If the prompt asks you how the figurative language conveys
the speaker’s attitude toward art, for instance, your thesis may be something like “The figura-
tive language in William Shakespeare’s “Sonnet 107” reveals the speaker’s belief that art con-
fers immortality.” The only new idea in this thesis statement is “art confers immortality.”
If you don’t have a prompt, you may have to dig through your notes a little until one idea
takes over. Look for an idea that can be discussed. In other words, make sure it has room for
analysis. Warning: Beware of creating a thesis statement that relies only on plot summary or
stays on the surface of the literary work that you’re writing about. For example, imagine that
you’re supposed to write about fate in Sophocles’ masterpiece, Oedipus the King, and you
come up with this thesis: “Oedipus meets his fate because he attempts to avoid it.” Yes, this
statement is true, but it doesn’t leave you much to say beyond recounting Oedipus’s flight
from his adoptive parents in Corinth and his subsequent, fated interactions with his biologi-
cal parents.

Also steer clear of thesis statements that are too broad or that contain too many ideas. You
don’t want to be in a situation where you have too much to prove. For example, a thesis
statement that declares “Oedipus suffers the worst fate in literature” involves a comparison
between Oedipus and every other character ever written. (I can’t even begin to calculate
how long the essay would be!) Here’s another clunker: “Oedipus fights with Tiresias because
Oedipus doesn’t like the prophecy, but he fights with all the other characters too, such as
Jocasta, Creon, and Laius, though he does get along fairly well with the chorus.” Again, you
would have to write all day to support that thesis. And even if you do take the time to write
all day, the essay will lack focus because the thesis is all over the place.
The following are some examples of good thesis statements:
In Edwidge Danticat’s story, “A Wall of Fire Rising,” the balloon symbolizes Guy’s 
unattainable goals.
Prospero, the main character in Shakespeare’s play The Tempest, must forgo his 
magical powers in order to reestablish normal human relationships.
Homer’s Odyssey establishes a higher standard of loyalty for Penelope than for
Odysseus.
Choosing subtopics
After your thesis statement is in place, zero in on subtopics, the supporting points or divi-
sions of the main idea that you’re discussing in the essay. The number and nature of the
subtopics depend on the question, so I can’t give you an all-purpose formula. However, do
look for logical divisions, or “baskets” into which you sort ideas. For example, if you’re writ-
ing an essay about diction, rhyme, and meter in a poem, you may have three baskets — one
for each of those poetic techniques.
Lots of people think that three subtopics — no more and no less — are mandatory. This
mythical requirement probably exists because a fine, sturdy structure for an essay is the five-
paragraph plan, which includes an introduction, a conclusion, and three body paragraphs.
You’ve probably been writing this sort of essay since elementary school. If what you want to
say in your AP essay breaks down into three subtopics, great. But don’t shoehorn four good
subtopics or expand two great subtopics into three. Let the content determine the number of
subtopics, not the reverse.
It’s tempting to throw in a great but irrelevant idea just because it’s, well, a great idea. Resist
that temptation. Your essay will turn out better if the subtopics support your thesis. After all,
you may love tuna salad and chocolate chip cookies, but I doubt that you’d appreciate tuna
mixed with chocolate chips.
Construction zone: Building the essay
I currently live next to a construction site, and though I’m not enjoying the mess, I am inter-
ested in the process. The builders’ first (and I imagine most crucial) job was to create a
sturdy framework. You face the same challenge in writing an essay. The only difference is 
in the materials that each of you use. My neighborhood builders construct with bricks and
steel; you work with an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion. I explain these
three literary building blocks in the following sections.
Introduction
In order to introduce the topic of introductions, I want to present three for your considera-
tion. Here’s the first one:
Mr. or Ms. Essay Grader, may I present Famous Poet and offspring, “Great Poem”?
46
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

Oops. Not the introduction you need. You’re in a literature exam, not a ballroom. Now take a
look at this one:
Poetry is a fine art, and everyone loves to read poems that deal with important issues.
Poets approach issues from unique points of view. In “Great Poem” by Famous Poet, sev-
eral important issues surface. One of these issues is . . .
Nope. Still not the introduction you need. As a matter of fact, the essay grader probably gave
up by the end of the second sentence. The introduction should focus on the literary work
you’re discussing, not on literature in general. Here’s one last example:
In Sylvia Plath’s poem “Tulips,” the speaker contrasts the red, vibrant flowers with the
stark whiteness of a hospital room. The imagery in the poem emphasizes the speaker’s
fragility.
Okay, third time’s the charm. This last example introduction contains all the essentials: the
name of the author, the title of the work, and the issues the essay will address (imagery and
the speaker’s condition). Notice how short this example is. I broke off after two and a half
sentences, but you can see how the stage is set for a full-scale analysis of the poem’s imagery
and the speaker’s mental and physical health.
Here are a couple of points to remember about introductions:
 In an essay that needs to be written in 40 minutes, such as those on the AP exam, get to
the point quickly and concisely. Think short, specific, and focused. If time isn’t a prob-
lem, you can throw in some fancy flourishes, such as an intriguing lead sentence or a
quotation.
 The title of a novel or a play is underlined (if you’re writing by hand) or italicized (if
you’re typing). The title of a poem usually appears in quotation marks, unless the
poem is book-length (such as Homer’s Odyssey).
 Avoid passive voice. For instance, refer to “Shakespeare’s Macbeth,” not “Macbeth 
written by William Shakespeare.”
 Talk about the literary work, not the essay. In other words, you don’t need to explain
that “in this essay I will. . . .” As the sneaker advertisement says, “Just do it.”
Body paragraphs
The body paragraphs are the meat of your essay. This is where you get the job done, actually
answering the question. When planning out your body paragraphs, remember that you
should devote one paragraph to each subtopic.
A topic sentence is the instant-message-length summary of a paragraph; it’s the statement
that orients the reader to the content. Think of the topic sentence as the kind of umbrella
you want to carry in a rainstorm. It has to be large enough to cover everything, but not so
huge that you knock out someone’s eye. You can place a topic sentence anywhere in the
paragraph, but the easiest spot is at the beginning. Here are a few examples:
The conflict between Guy and his wife is evident when they discuss their son’s future. (This
sentence begins a paragraph analyzing a conversation about whether to place the son
on the list for a factory job.)
Pronoun choices also emphasize the universality of the experience of “Diving into the
Wreck.” (The paragraph cites the pronouns, which are embedded in lines such as “I am
she I am he.”)
Many allusions to Thomas Jefferson further emphasize the irony of slavery. (This topic
sentence starts off a paragraph about Jefferson and slavery in the context of a memoir.)
47
Chapter 3: Getting the Most Out of English Class

The best essay writers knit body paragraphs together into a seamless whole by inserting
transitions. However, the AP exam doesn’t allow time for elegance; your goal is a simple tran-
sition that gets the job done. Think about the subtopic in the preceding paragraph and the
subtopic in the paragraph that you’re about to write. Build a short, logical bridge between
the two. (The later section “Writing with Flair: How to Take Your Prose Up a Notch” tackles
transitions in more detail.)
After the topic sentence is in place, insert evidence and analysis. I discuss evidence and
analysis for each genre in Chapter 7 (poetry) and Chapter 12 (prose and drama).
Throughout your essay (in the introduction, the body, and the conclusion), write in present
tense. For example, the speaker is, not was, in the hospital. The only time you move into past
tense is when you’re talking about a narrative (a literary work that tells a story). In that case,
you need to set one event before another, saying something like “The bell tower fell, and the
townspeople are collecting funds to restore it.”
Conclusion
Even though the conclusion is the cherry on top of the ice cream sundae, you may not have a
lot of time to formulate one if you’re writing under exam conditions. In fact, on the actual AP
exam you may not get to the conclusion at all. Don’t worry; you can still do well if your essay
stops abruptly. If you do have a moment, however, you can impress the exam grader with a
short but powerful conclusion.
When you’re writing a conclusion, here’s what to do and what to avoid:
 Do show what the reader gets from the literary work. In an essay about Chinua
Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, you may state that the reader sees the ignorance of the
colonial administration.
 Do emphasize the significance of the point you’ve made. If you wrote about the role of
the gods in Antigone, for instance, you might end with a statement about the inevitable
conflict between human and divine law.
 Do end with a quotation. This tactic’s a zinger if you do it right. In an essay about the
power of art expressed in a Shakespearean sonnet, you may conclude like this:
“Shakespeare’s figurative language expresses the transience of human life, in contrast
to art. The sonnet ends with a reference to the poem itself: ‘So long lives this, / And
this gives life to thee.’”
 Don’t repeat what you’ve already said. You’re writing a conclusion, not a summary.
 Don’t say, “In conclusion . . .” If you have to tell the reader that the paragraph is the
conclusion, you haven’t been clear enough.
 Don’t refer to the essay, saying, “In this essay I have proved that. . . .” Every English
teacher I know hates that sentence.
Writing with Flair: How to Take 
Your Prose Up a Notch
Anyone who sees the contents of my closet knows that I am not the most style-conscious
person on the planet (even though I live in Manhattan, one of the fashion centers of the coun-
try). However, I am very focused on writing style, and you should be also. Don’t forget that
your writing style develops as you read attentively. The section “Recognizing Style” earlier in
this chapter explains the best techniques for reading as a writer. Special attention to these
techniques will improve your style.
48
Part I: Hamlet Hits the Answer Grid: An Overview of the AP Lit Exam and Prep 

The easiest way to make writing more difficult for yourself is to aim for perfection. You want
a flawless piece of prose, but nobody starts at perfection. You have to work toward it. Give
yourself the freedom to write imperfectly, but leave time to fix your mistakes and add some
extra, late-but-brilliant ideas. If you tell yourself that you’re working on a rough draft that you
can edit, you’ll likely end up closer to perfection.
Choosing specific statements over general claims
A good rule to remember is that specific statements form the basis of your essay. Of course,
you may insert some general statements into an essay, but the ratio between specific and
general in your writing should resemble a nicely prepared steak dinner, with the specifics
being the steak and generalities the seasoning. Make sure you serve up enough specifics to
satisfy your reader.
Consider the following examples, drawn from an essay about Zora Neale Hurston’s novel
Their Eyes Were Watching God.
Bad general statement: Janie’s many exciting adventures help her to mature.
Why this statement is bad: Janie, the main character, does have an interesting life, but
this statement about her is boring! In fact, I nearly fell asleep writing it. Besides, “many
exciting adventures” may be applied to thousands of literary characters. You want
something that’s specific to Janie.
Better general statement: Janie’s three husbands, her flight with Teacake from
respectability, the flood that nearly drowns them, the rabid dog, and Janie’s shooting
Teacake are all steps in Janie’s journey to maturity.
Why this statement is better: This statement isn’t one-size-fits-all. Unlike the general
sentence about “many exciting adventures,” this one gets to the episodes that the writer
will discuss in his or her essay.
Expressing yourself clearly
The essay every teacher hates to grade is the one written by someone who spits out lofty
vocabulary left and right. To put this point another way: Don’t write sentences such as “The
interaction between filial personages led to Roger’s ultimate lack of approbation.” The only
way to respond to that sort of sentence is to skip over it and hope the essay improves. The
ideas are fine, but the style is so pretentious that readers flee for their lives.
New words enter your working vocabulary gradually. First you recognize them in someone
else’s writing. After you’ve “dated” a new word for a while, you’re ready to bring it home to
meet the parents and insert it into your own writing. Be patient, though. Don’t plop a word
that you’ve just learned into an essay. If you do, you may wind up using it inaccurately.
Another enemy of clarity is overly complicated sentence structure. Check out the following:
Bad sentence structure: On that day it was this perusal of the night sky, which was only
a morsel that had been strewn onto Henry’s path by his twin brother after a long day in
the windowless cubicle that was his life that led to his aspiration to become an
astronomer.
Why this structure is bad: Do I have to explain? Do you have any idea what that thing
calling itself a sentence is actually saying? If so, please report to Stockholm for the Nobel
Prize in Understanding Bad Writing.
49
Chapter 3: Getting the Most Out of English Class

Better sentence structure: One day, after Henry had spent a few years of work in a win-
dowless office cubicle, his twin brother insisted that they go to the park. The night sky
inspired Henry to study astronomy.
Why this structure is better: The preceding sentence may not earn you a trip to Sweden
to pick up the Nobel Prize for Literature, but at least the reader can decode it. Here’s the
bottom line: You don’t want to sound like a two-year-old, but you do want to write intelli-
gible prose.
Proceeding logically
Hopping around may be fun on the playground, but it’s deadly in an essay — your essay
reader is traveling with you from one idea to the next. Don’t skip around unnecessarily,
moving the reader from London to Topeka and back to Britain.
To help yourself proceed logically through your essay, spend a few minutes gathering ideas
before you write. After you know what you want to say, put the ideas in logical order. And
don’t forget to employ transitions to guide your reader smoothly from one thought to the
next. (For more details, check out the earlier section “Honing Your Essay-Writing Skills.”)
Suppose you’re writing about Franz Kafka’s masterpiece, The Metamorphosis, which is the
story of a man named Gregor Samsa who wakes up one day and discovers that he has turned
into a giant bug. (And you think your morning is bad when the coffeemaker breaks!) Suppose
you include in your essay one paragraph that describes the way that Gregor’s father takes
advantage of his son and another paragraph regarding the harshness of Gregor’s employer.
The transition may be something like the italicized sentence in this excerpt:
Mr. Samsa lives off Gregor’s income and does not attempt to find work himself until
forced to do so by Gregor’s metamorphosis. After Gregor changes, Mr. Samsa beats
Gregor with a stick and confines him to a bedroom.
The parents are not the only characters who exploit Gregor. Despite Gregor’s unblemished
record, the chief clerk comes to Gregor’s house to complain that Gregor missed the
early train and soon accuses Gregor of financial impropriety.
Notice that the transition sentence nods toward the discussion of Gregor’s father in the pre-
ceding paragraph. The phrase “not the only characters” sets the stage for the next idea, the
discussion of Gregor’s employer.
Spicing up your writing with variety
Little kids like to hear the same story over and over, read in exactly the same way, just before
bedtime. Why? Because monotony leads to sleep. Think about that fact when you write an
AP essay. Do you really want to buy a ticket to the Land of Nod for your exam grader? Keep
in mind that exam graders get the equivalent of a half-price ticket. After all, they’re already
tired from reading a few hundred essays when they open your pink AP answer booklet. The
same warning applies to essays written for your English teacher. Do us all a favor and spice
up your writing by
 Avoiding repetition
 Varying sentence length and structure

Here are a few examples:
Bad statement: Telemachus matures and grows up as he searches for his father,
Odysseus.
Why this statement is bad: Pardon my snoring. A dictionary writer may certainly find a
tiny distinction between “matures” and “grows up,” but in this sentence they refer to the
same process.
Better statement: Telemachus matures as he searches for his father, Odysseus.
Why this statement is better: This statement gets straight to the point without repeti-
tion. The bottom line here: Say it once and move on.
Bad statement: Penelope remains faithful to her absent husband. Penelope never gives
in to the suitors. Penelope tells her suitors why she cannot marry. Penelope must weave
a shroud first. Penelope fools the suitors by unraveling her weaving each night.
Why this statement is bad: Five sentences in a row begin with “Penelope.” Each is of a
similar length (around seven words) and has the same structure (subject-verb). Time 
to kick it up, as the television chef says.
Better statement: Faithful to her absent husband, Penelope resists the suitors. After
telling them that she cannot marry until the shroud is completed, she unravels her
weaving each night.
Why this statement is better: The choppiness is gone, and the two sentences have 
different patterns.

Poetry in Motion

In this part . . .
W
hat’s it to you? Poetry, I mean. Do you think of it as
“Ooh, I get to read all this great stuff and maybe
change everything I think about life?” Or is your response
something more like “if that’s what they mean, why don’t
poets just say it?” Regardless of which category you fall
into — and I’m planted firmly in the first one — Part II
holds something for you. Chapters 4 and 5 refresh your
memory of poetry basics and provide a can opener so you
can extract the meaning of a poem and appreciate the
techniques poets use to convey that meaning. Chapter 6
enters multiple-choice territory, surveying common types
of questions and explaining the best approach to each.
Chapters 7 and 8 let you practice both multiple-choice and
essay questions on poetry.

Chapter 4
Sorting Out Poetic Devices
In This Chapter
 Understanding the literary terms used in poetry
 Appreciating how sound and form influence poetry
A
merican novelist Ernest Hemingway was once asked why it took him so long to write
just a few pages. The hard part, said Hemingway, is “getting the words right.” Poets
spend even more time than novelists on “the hard part,” mostly because a poem’s word
choice can add, subtract, or change meaning. And so can word order, punctuation, capital-
ization, the appearance of the words on the page, the sound of the poem, figurative lan-
guage, and other similar elements. In this chapter, I review some of the poetic techniques
that poets employ to carry meaning to their audiences. On the AP English Literature and
Composition exam, you’ll likely be asked about poetic elements in the multiple-choice sec-
tion. Skill in recognizing these elements and their effect on the poem can also improve your
essay on a poetry selection.
Your Link to a Poem’s World: Imagery
The five senses — sight, smell, hearing, touch, and taste — connect human beings to the real
world. In a poem, sensory details, or imagery, may link readers to the imaginary world cre-
ated by the poet. For example, Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem “The Rime of the Ancient
Mariner” takes you into a fantastic, perfect for a dark-and-spooky-night situation. How fantas-
tic? Death plays dice in one stanza, and dead seamen sail a ship in another. (And you thought
the dead pirates’ tale started with Johnny Depp!) The sensory details of this poem take you
into the Ancient Mariner’s world. Here are a couple of samples:
Sight:
“Her lips were red, her looks were free,
Her locks were yellow as gold.
Her skin was as white as leprosy.”
Taste and hearing:
“With throats unslaked, with black lips baked,
We could nor laugh nor wail;
Through utter drought all dumb we stood!
I bit my arm, I sucked the blood,
And cried, A sail! a sail!”

56
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
Touch:
“I closed my lids, and kept them close,
And the balls like pulses beat,
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
Lay like a load on my weary eye . . .”
Smell:
“. . . the rotting deck
The cold sweat melted from their limbs,
Nor rot nor reek did they . . .”
Poets have an unlimited number of sensory details to choose from when they’re writing. The
key consideration for you, then, is to determine why the poet has selected or left out particu-
lar details. Consider both of these categories when you’re analyzing a poem. Figure out the
overall impression created by the details included. Imagine additional, missing details. How
would that extra information change the effect of the poem?
Expressing Creativity with Figurative Language
A very large portion of the official poet’s toolkit is devoted to figurative language, the overall
term for figures of speech. Figurative language, in the English-teacher world, refers to lan-
guage that leaves the literal and hits the realm of imagination. My own theory, which I can’t
prove, is that figurative language is attractive to poets because they have only words to
express the ideas that reside in the preverbal level. The only way out of this paradoxical situ-
ation is imagination, the lifeblood of figurative language. When you’re reading a poem, pay
special attention to the figures of speech explained here.
Similes and metaphors
Similes and metaphors probably first showed up in your English class years ago. They’re ele-
mentary, in both academia and real life, because people use them every day to express com-
parisons. Similes are explicit comparisons using “like” or “as,” and metaphors are implied
comparisons without “like” or “as.” Sometimes these comparisons are clichéd (“pretty as a
picture” or “life is not a bowl of cherries”), but in quality poems they’re creative and original.
Here are some examples:
Similes:
“We harden like trees, and like rivers are cold.” (from “The Lover” by Lady Mary Wortley
Montague)
“Like a fawn from the arrow, startled and wild, / A woman swept by us, bearing a 
child . . .” (from “Eliza Harris” by Frances E. W. Harper)
“He watches from his mountain walls, / And like a thunderbolt he falls.” (from “The
Eagle” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson)

57
Chapter 4: Sorting Out Poetic Devices
Metaphors:
“A mother’s love! deep grows / That plant of Heaven . . .” (from “Lines Suggested 
on Reading ‘An Appeal to Christian Women of the South’ by A.E. Grimke” by Ada, 
Sarah L. Forten)
“. . . these boughs which shake against the cold, / Bare ruined choirs, where late the
sweet birds sang.” (from Sonnet 73 by William Shakespeare)
“Thy rights are empire. . . .” (from “The Rights of Women” by Anna Laetitia Barbauld)
When you encounter a simile or a metaphor and want to find out what it’s supposed to mean,
examine the comparison. (Visualizing may help. For more on this technique, check out
Chapter 5.) Ask yourself what the comparison brings to the poem. For example, Barbauld’s
metaphor (the last example in the previous list) compares women’s rights to an empire.
Empires are usually large (bigger than countries) and powerful. Because they can be aggres-
sive, they must be defended. These ideas are folded into the poem by the metaphor, enrich-
ing the statement the poet makes about women.
Personification, apostrophe, synecdoche
Turning people into things and things into people is a poet’s right. So is raising the dead, or
at least talking to them. (Wouldn’t you love to have such power? You do. Just write a poem.)
Several figures of speech come from these poetic powers, including the following:
 Personification, a specialized type of metaphor in which you ascribe human traits to
nonhuman objects or ideas
 Apostrophe, which addresses an idea, an object, or a dead or absent person
 Synecdoche, which refers to a part as if it were the whole (or vice versa)
Here are some examples of each:
Personification:
“. . . but Patience to prevent / That murmur, soon replies. . . .” (from “When I Consider
How My Light Is Spent,” by John Milton)
“The river glideth at his own sweet will . . .” (from “Composed upon Westminster Bridge,
September 3, 1802,” by William Wordsworth)
“Because I could not stop for Death / He kindly stopped for me—” (from an untitled
poem by Emily Dickinson)
What do you call an extraordinarily clever metaphor?
Metaphors place two things (or people) together, letting
one describe the other. When metaphors stretch into
really strange and clever territory and compare two
things that are seemingly very dissimilar, they’re called
conceits. This sort of conceit has nothing to do with
snobbery but a lot to do with ingenuity and complex
meaning. Two of my favorite conceits are in John
Donne’s poem “A Valediction Forbidding Mourning.” The
speaker in the poem is going on a journey that will take
him away from his beloved for a long time. He tells her
not to worry about losing his love, which he compares
to gold that has been “to airy thinness beat.” It will
endure hammering by stretching, but it will not break. (All
the ladies can sigh and swoon now.) He also compares
himself and his lover to a compass, the mathematical
device that draws circles. His lover is the “fixed foot”
that “in the center sit[s]. / Yet when the other far doth
roam, / It leans and hearkens after it.” How clever!

58
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
Apostrophe:
“Imagination! who can sing thy force?” (from “On Imagination” by Phyllis Wheatley)
“With how sad steps, Oh Moon, thou climb’st the skies . . .” (from Astrophil and Stella by
Sir Philip Sidney)
“O wild West Wind, thou breath of Autumn’s being . . .” (from “Ode to the West Wind” by
Percy Bysshe Shelley)
Synecdoche:
“Till hearts shall relax their tension, / And careworn brows forget.” (from “Son for the
People” by Frances E. W. Harper)
“. . . I should have been a pair of ragged claws / Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.”
(from “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” by T.S. Eliot)
“Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears.” (from Julius Caesar by William
Shakespeare)
Do some arithmetic when you encounter these three figures of speech. Think about what
each adds or subtracts. If an object or a quality is personified, you relate to it on a more emo-
tional (or dare I say personal?) level. Thus feelings are added. If the part substitutes for the
whole, some humanity is subtracted. For instance, when “all hands are on deck,” the sailors
cease to be individuals and are reduced to their capacity to work.
Discovering Symbolism, Irony, and Allusion
American writer Dorothy Parker, famous for her cutting wit, wrote about receiving “one per-
fect rose” in her poem of the same name. Ever practical, Parker mused that a better present
would be “one perfect limousine.” The rose, of course, symbolizes romantic love. In real life
or in poetry, a symbol represents more than itself.
A metaphor is usually a one-liner, a single comparison in a poem. Kick it up a notch and you
have an extended metaphor — a comparison that’s explored in detail in perhaps an entire
stanza. In comparison, a symbol takes imaginative comparisons to the max, weaving extra
meaning into the entire work. The symbol may be a place (the setting), an object, or an
action.
Irony is easy to recognize but difficult to define. You’re in ironic territory when a dog bumps
into the dogcatcher, knocks him into a cage, and slams the door shut with a wagging tail.
You’re also in ironic territory when someone says the opposite of what he or she means. For
example, had Dorothy Parker been an ardent conservationist, the kind of person who would
rather walk 20 miles rather than burn carbon fuel, her comment about the limousine would
be ironic. Irony can be situational (the dog/dogcatcher example above) or verbal (the Parker
comment).
Allusion is a reference to something outside the literary work that brings everything associ-
ated with the allusion (literary, historic, biographical, and cultural) into the work. In his
poem “Marriage,” Gregory Corso alludes to “Flash Gordon,” a character from a sci-fi space
adventure. The allusion reinforces the idea that the speaker is entering unexplored territory
(married life).
Here are some examples of these three literary terms.

59
Chapter 4: Sorting Out Poetic Devices
Symbolism and irony:
“A Poison Tree” by William Blake
I was angry with my friend:
I told my wrath, my wrath did end.
I was angry with my foe:
I told it not, my wrath did grow.
And I waterd it in fears,
Night & morning with my tears;
And I sunnéd it with smiles,
And with soft deceitful wiles.
And it grew both day and night,
Till it bore an apple bright.
And my foe beheld it shine,
And he knew that it was mine,
And into my garden stole,
When the night had veild the pole;
In the morning glad I see
My foe outstretchd beneath the tree.
William Blake’s short poem packs as much of a wallop as the apple (line 10), which is
symbolic of the hidden wrath or anger that grows and grows in the speaker until it kills
the enemy who eats it. The tree (line 16) is also a symbol, representing the slow process
by which anger turns to vengeance and violence.
Not all symbols are as obvious as Blakes’s apple and tree or Dorothy Parker’s rose.
When you’re symbol-hunting, free-association is often the best technique to use. (Turn
to Chapter 5 for more information on this technique.)
Blake’s poem is also heavy with irony. The foe eats the apple because he knew that it
was the speaker’s (line 12). Therefore the foe’s attempt to hurt the speaker (by stealing
his apple) results, ironically, in death.
Allusion:
And that one talent which is death to hide
Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest he returning chide . . .
The preceding lines from John Milton’s poem, “When I Consider How My Light Is Spent,”
allude to a story in the Bible’s New Testament in which a servant is given a “talent” (a
coin) by his master. Rather than making use of the gift, the servant buries it. When the
master returns, he scolds the servant and banishes him “into outer darkness.” The bib-
lical allusion brings the idea of divine punishment and human accountability into the
poem, which is the speaker’s tortured reflection on how he uses his own poetic talent.

Talking the Talk: Understanding 
Diction and Tone
Excuse me, dearest reader. I humbly entreat you to eschew the latest news about Britney,
Brangelina, and Paris and instead to devote your attention to diction and tone. Your failure to
attend to this matter may result in irreparable harm. Do I sound funny talking like that?
Maybe this will sound a bit more commonplace: Listen up! Drop the gossip magazine, turn off
your PDA, and get with the diction/tone program! Or else . . . 
Why do these two comments sound different? Let me count the ways. The words come from
two separate planets. The first comment resides in formal territory, and the second comment
lives on the streets. Put the two side by side and you see contrasting diction, or the vocabu-
lary with which a writer expresses himself or herself.
I bet you were still in your cradle when you first understood tone, which is the way an author
communicates a feeling or attitude toward the subject he or she is writing about. For exam-
ple, in speaking terms, a sympathetic tone, as in “Oh, did you skin your knee? Poor baby!”
can be distinguished from “Take out the garbage now!” without any formal lessons. Tone in
writing is a little more difficult to determine, of course, because you can’t hear the author’s
words as the author intended them to be read. Instead, you have to pick up clues from the
text.
AP English Lit exam writers love to ask about tone, so be sure to get a good handle on it. To
determine tone in poetry (or in other writing), you have to consider diction and syntax, the
grammatical structure of the sentence. You also have to consider which details are included
and which are left out. A little common sense helps as well. For instance, if the author is list-
ing reasons and answering likely objections in advance, the tone is argumentative or persua-
sive. If the poet goes on and on about the snowy, picture-perfect holidays of childhood,
nostalgia is a good bet.
Here’s a poetic fragment written by John Keats entitled “This Living Hand”:
This living hand, now warm and capable
Of earnest grasping, would, if it were cold
And in the icy silence of the tomb,
So haunt thy days and chill thy dreaming nights
That thou wouldst wish thine own heart dry of blood
So in my veins red life might stream again.
And thou be conscience-calmed — see here it is —
I hold it towards you.
To figure out the tone of “This Living Hand,” you don’t have to know that these were probably
the last lines of poetry that Keats wrote before his death at age 26. Nor do you need to know
that Keats was aware that he was dying. Take away those biographical facts, and you still see
that this poetic fragment is both mournful and realistic in tone. The words are straightfor-
ward. For instance, the “icy silence” (line 3) contrasts with “red life” (line 6). The first five lines
are almost brutal: This hand would “haunt” and “chill” (line 4) you. Line 7 is a command. This
poet isn’t turning away in sentimentality. He’s facing death, and he’s making the reader face it
also, as he stretches out his still “living hand” — “I hold it towards you” (line 8).
When you’re determining tone, “hear” the poem in your head. Put yourself in the author’s
shoes and imagine what he or she feels. Examine the language closely, and bring your own
experience to the poem.

Chapter 4: Sorting Out Poetic Devices
Adding Meaning with Sound
The earliest poetry was an auditory experience only — no one wrote anything down, possi-
bly because no one could. Interestingly, lots of modern poetry isn’t written down either, as
anyone who’s attended a poetry slam knows. However, sound matters in poetry regardless of
whether written text is involved. Sometimes it matters a little and sometimes a lot.
Poets, like songwriters, manipulate sound in several ways. They play with rhythm and rhyme,
with patterns and pattern breaks, and with a few established forms. Tune your ears to “extra
sharp” and consider the elements of sound that are discussed in the following sections.
Rhyme
I imagine that the tendency to rhyme is hardwired into human brains. Rhyme is probably the
first element you notice when you hear poetry, and it’s also the element that little kids invari-
ably insert into the first poems they write. In the earliest, nonwritten poetry, rhyme probably
helped the poet or performer remember the poem. And even now, you can probably recall
song lyrics more easily than a nonrhymed poem. The most obvious rhymes occur at the end
of a line, but repetitive sounds may occur inside lines also.
End-of-line rhymes
End-of-line rhymes do some neat things. For instance, they create patterns, they tie particu-
lar lines together, and they separate some thoughts from others. You can name a rhyme
scheme (a rhyme pattern) with letters of the alphabet. The first sound is “a,” the second “b,”
and so forth. Here’s an example of one popular rhyme scheme:
a b b a a b b a a b b a c c
How would you expect the units of meaning to break down? How about three groups of four,
with a pair of lines for the final punch, like this:
a b b a
a b b a
a b b a
cc
The previous rhyme scheme belongs to an English sonnet. (I explain sonnets in more detail
later in the chapter.) It works together with meaning. The first four lines present an idea. The
second and third sets of lines elaborate on the idea. The last two lines, or couplet, present
the logical conclusion, an extension of the idea, or the moral of the story. In Shakespeare’s
“Sonnet 73,” for example, the poet presents three different images of aging — winter, sunset,
and a dying fire. The couplet hits hard: You love more intensely what you’re about to lose.
Poets have created thousands of standard rhyme schemes and about a million variations on
those standards. Therefore, when you’re analyzing a poem, don’t get hung up on the rhyme
scheme if you have letters all over the place — something resembling abcdbeccghij, for
example. That’s too weird to matter much. But if you see a simple pattern, check to see how
meaning and rhyme scheme relate to each other.
Internal rhymes
Sound patterns that don’t occur at the end of lines are also important. Look for repetition of
vowels, which is called assonance, or consonants, which is called alliteration). If you hear
repetition, examine the linked words for meaning.
Take a look at the following poem, “To Lucasta, Going to the Wars,” by Richard Lovelace, a
17th-century poet:

62
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
Tell me not, Sweet, I am unkind,
That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,
To war and arms I fly.
True, a new mistress now I chase,
The first foe in the field;
And with a stronger faith embrace
A sword, a horse, a shield.
Yet this inconstancy is such
As you too shall adore;
I could not love thee, dear, so much,
Loved I not honor more.
Check out the long “I” sounds: Besides the actual word “I,” which appears in several spots,
you have “unkind” (line 1), “quiet mind” (line 3), and “fly” (line 4). These words, linked
together, imply that the speaker is going to “fly” (escape) perhaps from “quiet,” which is in
the “mind” more than in reality. The speaker also worries about being thought “unkind.” Now
for the consonants: Search for the letter F and you turn up “fly” (line 4), “first foe” and “field”
(line 6), and “faith” (line 7). Here’s the meaning behind all this: The escape and the battle
with the enemy is a matter of faith.
Rhythm (meter)
In poetry, rhythm, also known as meter, comes from two factors: how long a poem’s lines are
and where the accents occur in a line. By accents, I don’t mean the tendency of New Yorkers
to refer to pasta’s favorite mate as “spaghetti source.” Instead, what I mean is that English
words have accented, or stressed, syllables. The word “syllable,” for example, is really three
sounds, with the first sound being the strongest, written in all capital letters here: SILL ah
bull. If you say, “sill AH bull,” no one will understand you. (Well, they’ll at least think you talk
funny.)
By manipulating line length and stressed and unstressed syllables, poets create patterns. The
most important element of a pattern isn’t its regularity, although the regularity can convey
important thematic meaning as well as imply harmony or unity. It’s the pattern breaks that
truly matter.
To understand this effect, think of the children’s game, Duck Duck Goose, in which one child
walks around a circle of kids, tapping each on the head and saying “duck” over and over,
finally declaring one of the children “goose.” The “goose” has to get up and chase the child
around the circle, racing for the empty spot. The word “goose” breaks the pattern and initi-
ates a response. Pattern breaks in poetry do the same thing.
Read aloud the following poem, “She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways,” by William
Wordsworth:
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove.
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love;

Chapter 4: Sorting Out Poetic Devices
A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye!
—Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.
She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
The difference to me!
The lines in the preceding poem have a heartbeat sound: da DUM, da DUM, da DUM.
Consider line 2, rewritten here with the stressed syllables capitalized:
be SIDE the SPRINGS of DOVE
Hear the pattern? Now consider line 1, which has the break underlined here:
she DWELT a MONG the un TROD en WAYS
The break here emphasizes “untrodden.” Other spots in this poem where the rhythm breaks
are at the words “violet” (line 5), “Half” (line 6), and “Fair” (line 7). All the qualities of Lucy
are emphasized with these breaks: she’s pretty, not usually noticed (if the path is untrodden,
people aren’t around), and mortal (flowers, such as violets, don’t last long). The “Half” break
is interesting: Not many people notice her, but the speaker does, so before her death she was
only “Half hidden.”
Poets sometimes cheat a little when they’re creating a rhythm. If they need an extra syllable,
for example, they add an accent, which of course stresses that letter. In “A Poison Tree,”
shown earlier in this chapter, Blake wrote “sunnéd” because he wanted two syllables, not the
single syllable that he would have had with “sunned.” In the same way, an apostrophe (the
punctuation mark that creates contractions) cuts out a syllable if the pattern demands a
shorter sound.
Because the literary world thrives on terminology, way too many names have been given to
various rhythms. You’ve probably heard of some, including iambic pentameter, the heartbeat
sound (da DUM) repeated five times per line. Sonnets and Shakespearean plays are written in
this rhythm. Another popular term is blank verse, which is unrhymed iambic pentameter. I
could add another 20 pages and give you a migraine by listing and explaining all the terms
that apply to rhythm, but I won’t. If you really want to know what a trochee is, check out a
poetry textbook. On the actual AP exam, you can score a five without knowing all that liter-
ary vocabulary. The important thing is to know that rhythms exist and affect the reader’s
perception of the poem.
Examining Form: Line Breaks, 
Stanzas, and Enjambment
How does the poem look on the page? Where do the lines and stanzas break? The answers to
these questions partly expose the form of a poem. Other elements of poetic technique also
contribute to form, such as rhythm and rhyme (discussed earlier in the chapter). Some
poetic forms are standard; these standard forms, such as ballads and epics, have names and
more requirements than an Ivy League college. You don’t need to know a lot about these
standard forms for the AP English Lit exam, so in this section I take you through only the
basic forms you may encounter.

Part II: Poetry in Motion 
You can impress the exam grader no end if you correctly identify the form of a poem that
you’re writing about. If you aren’t sure, however, don’t take a chance. You don’t want a
grader shouting, “Hey, everybody! This guy thinks that 42-line poem is a haiku!” Even if you
can’t name a particular form, you should consider the appearance of the poem and the line
and stanza breaks. Seeing how those elements relate to meaning takes you a step closer to a
great AP essay and to a higher score on the multiple-choice questions.
Appearance on the page
Poets in the old days before computers had to cross out and rewrite every time they
changed a line break. Today, poets get to play endlessly with the end of a line, the end of a
stanza, and the right and left margins.
Line breaks
Where a line breaks is a very big deal. Unconsciously, the reader sees a pause, which may or
may not be reinforced by a punctuation mark. Zoom your eyes over these two selections,
each from a separate poem:
There is a lady sweet and kind,
Was never face so pleased my mind;
I did but see her passing by,
And yet I love her till I die.
The time is come, I must depart
from thee, oh famous city;
I never yet to rue my smart,
did find that thou had’st pity.
The first selection, which is an excerpt from an anonymous, early-17th-century poem, has a
punctuation mark at the end of each line. This punctuation creates a double-whammy: The
end of the line signals the reader to stop and so does the punctuation. Each line comes
across as a forceful unit. You can almost imagine someone making a case: “Your honor, There
is a lady sweet and kind.” (Slap on witness stand.) “Was never face so pleased my mind.”
(Slap.) “I did but see her passing by.” (Stronger slap.) “And yet I love her till I die.” (Triple-
strength slap.)
Now check out the second selection. No punctuation mark appears at the end of the first
line. The line break ends with the word “depart,” which means “leave.” However, “depart”
also brings thoughts of death (the “dearly departed,” as the saying goes). The line break says
stop, and the reader thinks, at least subconsciously, “I must depart — I must die.” But
because there’s no punctuation, the reader continues: “I must depart / from thee, oh famous
city.” Now instead of death, the reader imagines the idea of a physical journey away from a
“famous city” or perhaps a permanent move.
The title of this poem, by the way, is “A Communication Which the Author Had to London,
Before She Made Her Will.” The author is Isabella Whitney, who in fact was leaving London to
escape mounting debts. The title shows you that the punctuation-free first line wasn’t an
accident. The poet actually wanted to bring up the idea of death. For those of you who are
addicted to literary terminology (perhaps you should join a support group), a line break
without punctuation, with the thought continuing into the next line or stanza, is called
enjambment.

65
Chapter 4: Sorting Out Poetic Devices
Stanza breaks
Stanzas, grouped lines in a poem, are analogous to paragraphs in a piece of prose or to
verses in a song. Stanzas may contain complete, separate thoughts. A stanza may also con-
nect to another stanza in the same way that a line may run into the next if no punctuation
stops the reader. However, a stanza break gives an extra forceful message, a kind of giant
stop sign. When that stop sign is contradicted by a line that runs on, the poet has probably
tucked a double meaning into the poem, much like the use of “depart” in Whitney’s poem.
Lines, of course, may be cut to create a regular pattern — a particular number of syllables or
a certain rhyme scheme. Ditto for stanzas, only now you’re looking at a particular number of
lines instead of syllables. When you’re reading a poem, notice where the lines and stanzas
break and, most importantly, why the lines and stanzas break where they do.
Margins
The well-dressed poem, conscious of its appearance, also has to manage its margins. The
simplest poems are flush left, with the right margin determined by the logical line break.
Consider this excerpt from “To the Right Honourable William” by Phyllis Wheatley:
I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate
Was snatch’d from Afric’s fancy’d happy seat:
What pangs excruciating must molest,
What sorrows labour in my parent’s breast?
Poets will often play with margins also, indenting lines to focus extra attention on them or to
separate them from the preceding or following lines, as in this excerpt from “In Memorium 
A. H. H. ” by Alfred, Lord Tennyson:
What are thou then? I cannot guess;
But though I seem in star and flower
To feel thee some diffusive power,
I do not therefore love thee less.
Notice that the first and last lines of this stanza make one complete thought: What are you? I
can’t guess, but that doesn’t mean I love you less. The second and third lines are also a unit
of thought: I feel something, some power, when I see a star or a flower. As you see from the
title, this poem is written in memory of “A. H. H.” Hence the stanza is a meditation on death
and the speaker’s relationship to the dead person. The margins reinforce the separation of
the two ideas that the stanza contains.
Margins can get even more creative. Lawrence Ferlinghetti’s poem “Constantly Risking
Absurdity,” for example, compares the poet’s art to a circus performer’s balancing on a high
wire. Some lines are flush left, some are flush right, and some are in the middle. Visually, the
poem appears to teeter-totter, striving for balance. That appearance matches the meaning of
the poem.
Some poets take special effects to the max and mold their words into a visual pattern. John
Hollander has a great poem shaped like a swan and another that resembles a key. The French
writer Apollonaire sends words about rain streaking in vertical columns down the page. You
probably won’t find any of these shape poems on the AP English Lit exam; the exam writers
avoid controversy, and shape poems are sometimes seen as gimmicks. They are, however,
lots of fun. After you’ve finished your exam, take a look at some shape poems and write one
yourself.

Standard forms
The AP English Literature and Composition exam won’t plop a lot of questions about stan-
dard forms in the multiple-choice portion of the test. And the literary selection you write
about in the first or second essays may or may not be an easily recognizable form. Because
you don’t need to know much about these standard forms, and because so many are out
there that a thorough discussion of the topic would make this book so thick that only a fork-
lift could pick it up, I’ll stick to the basics.
Here’s a list of the few poetry forms that you should keep in mind:
 Ballads: A ballad sounds like a song, and for very good reason: Lots of ballads were
originally sung, and a good ballad is musical even without an accompanying orchestra.
Ballads have regular rhythm and rhyme, four- or five-line stanzas, and lots of repetition.
They generally tell a story, complete with characters, dialogue, and description. Many
ballads have been passed down orally from generation to generation, and you often see
several versions of one ballad. My highly subjective list of great ballads includes “Sir
Patrick Spens,” “Bang the Drum Slowly,” and “The Streets of Laredo.”
 Epics: An epic is a long poem — book length! — that tells a story, usually about a hero
or heroine. Homer’s Odyssey is an epic, as is Omeros, which is Derek Walcott’s modern
take on the Odyssey. An epic generally has regular rhythm and may have rhyme as well.
 Odes: An ode praises or contemplates a person, an object, or a quality. Unlike some
standard forms, the form of an ode isn’t governed by a ton of rules. Many odes have
three stanzas, but some have two and some have four (or even more). An ode is seri-
ous and formal. Think of an ode as the poetic equivalent of an essay. Read “Ode on a
Grecian Urn” by John Keats and “Ode to the West Wind” by Percy Bysshe Shelley for
two fine examples of this form.
 Sonnets: A sonnet is a 14-line poem that has, in my mind, the tightest set of rules in
Poetry Land. I once asked a poet who was visiting my class why anyone would want to
be bound by the sonnet form. Her answer? She said that when her feelings were out of
control, the only way she could express them was by keeping them in a secure cage,
and the sonnet form was the strongest cage she could find.
Apart from the 14-line rule, sonnets must be written in iambic pentameter (which I
explain earlier in the chapter). Sonnets also have to follow a definite rhyme scheme. To
make things even more complicated, the divisions created by the rhyme scheme have
to relate to the content. Here are a couple types of sonnets you might come across:
• The English sonnet distinguishes three sets of four lines (four lines is a quatrain in
lit-speak) and one couplet (pair of lines). The rhyme scheme may be abab cdcd
efef gg or abba abba abba cc or another variation. In this sonnet, the first 12 lines
generally set out an idea that is restated three ways. The couplet is the “moral of
the story” or the logical conclusion.
• The Italian sonnet has a set of eight lines (an octave) and a set of six (a sestet). In
this type of sonnet, you may find a question or a problem in the octave and a
solution in the sestet.
Shakespeare wrote more than a hundred amazing sonnets. You may also enjoy the son-
nets of Elizabeth Barrett Browning and some modern sonnets by Claude McKay and
William Butler Yeats.
 Free verse: As opposed to blank verse, which I mention in the “Rhythm (meter)” sec-
tion earlier in this chapter, free verse has no set structure at all. Lots of modern poets
write in free verse, no doubt sighing with relief as they do so. Anything goes in this
form!

Unraveling Poetic Meaning
In This Chapter
 Identifying the literal and deeper meanings of a poem
 Using context and point of view to understand a poem
 Connecting your own experience to a poem
A
ccording to a famous but possibly untrue story, poet Robert Browning was once
stopped by a poetry-groupie (yes, they exist) and asked to explain a line from one of
his poems. After thinking for a few minutes, Browning supposedly said that when the line
was written, only God and Robert Browning understood what it meant. “And now, Madam,”
continued Browning, “only God knows.”
I doubt you’ll have to puzzle through anything as difficult as Browning’s poem when you take
the AP English Literature and Composition exam. However, you will have to read some compli-
cated works and nail both the literal and the deeper meanings. And don’t forget that poetry
accounts for anywhere from one third to one half of the exam. Poems appear in both the 
multiple-choice and the essay sections of the test. In this chapter, I refresh your memory of the
basics of poetry, explaining how to approach a poem and how to identify and appreciate poetic
techniques. I also take you on a test-drive of these techniques using some terrific poems.
Decoding Literal Meaning
The comment that most often makes me grind my teeth (and it’s made so frequently that
I’m chewing with little more than stubs) is “Poetry means whatever you think it means.”
I’ll unclench my jaw long enough to explain why this statement is not true.
Yes, you interpret a poem, and yes, you bring your own experience to bear on the text. And
yes, poets work from such a deep, intuitive level that sometimes even they don’t know what
themes and ideas they’re tucking into their poems. But the poem does have a text, and that
text isn’t infinite. You can’t, for example, turn “Mary Had a Little Lamb” into a poem about
the horrors of war. Therefore, before you dive into interpretation (covered later in this
chapter), you have to decode the literal meaning of the poem — what the poem actually
says. The exam-writers are wise to this point, and quite a few multiple-choice questions
examine your decoding skills.
Discovering poetic meaning 
with a simple set of steps
Chances are the first time you read a poem, you sense at least some of what the poet is
trying to convey. You may know right away, for example, that the poem is about war and its
tragic effects or about love and its tragic effects. However, if you stop after that first reading,
you miss most of the good stuff. Quality poetry packs a lot of meaning into a relatively small

68
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
space. To discover what’s really there on the literal level, you have to read the poem a couple
of times — not passively, but interactively. To do so, try these steps:
1. Zero in on unfamiliar words.
To a poet, words are the perfect pail and shovel in the world’s best sandbox. Some poets
delight in finding words that hardly anyone ever uses. Others specialize in the most
obscure definition of a common word. On the first read-through, underline any word that
you don’t understand. If you aren’t operating under test security conditions, haul out a
good dictionary or turn to a quality online source to check the definitions of the words
that you’ve underlined. If you’re taking an AP exam, dictionaries aren’t allowed. In this
situation, you have to work from context. Check out the later section “Considering
Context and Point of View” for strategies that help you answer “vocabulary-in-context”
questions.
When dictionaries are off-limits and a word totally stumps you, don’t give up on the
poem. You may still be able to understand the main idea and get most or all of the 
multiple-choice answers right. If the poem appears in the essay portion of the exam, you
probably have tons to write about, even without knowing one or two puzzling words.
2. Examine punctuation.
Punctuation helps you untangle one sentence from another. Look for periods, question
marks, or exclamation points that mark the end of a sentence. Also check for semi-
colons, colons, commas, dashes, and parentheses. A semicolon continues a sentence
and tells you that the words before the semicolon belong to one unit of thought and
the words after the semicolon belong to another unit. Whatever the semicolon con-
nects is closely related. A colon may precede an explanation, or it may introduce a list.
Commas and parentheses set off words that should be grouped together.
Poets are rebels, and they don’t always feel bound by the usual rules of punctuation
(or spelling, capitalization, the tax code, or anything else for that matter). When you
check punctuation, keep in mind that the poet may be bending or breaking rules. If so,
ask why he or she is breaking the rules, because chances are the change is intended to
make a point.
3. Check syntax.
Syntax is the English-teacher term for the way a sentence is put together grammatically.
Poets often fiddle with the usual subject-verb order, so you may need to rearrange
words or phrases in order to grasp what’s going on. Start by asking yourself which
ideas belong together. Then focus on the verb, the word that expresses action or state
of being. To determine the subject, ask who or what is doing the action or exists in that
state of being. Next, restate the subject-verb pair and ask “what?” The answer, if you
get one, is a complement.
You don’t need to memorize grammatical terms. What’s important is that once you
have the subject-verb-complement (or subject-verb, if there is no complement), you’ve
established the foundation of the sentence. Now turn to descriptive words or phrases.
Ask “where,” “how,” “what kind,” and similar questions to sort out what’s describing
what.
4. Paraphrase the poem.
If you haven’t done so already, read the poem a second time. Don’t forget the title! It
adds meaning also. After you’ve reread the poem, restate it in your own words. This
activity is called paraphrasing.
5. Identify the people in the poem.
If you have time, one more reading may be in order — unless, of course, you’re 100 per-
cent sure that you’ve grasped everything already. During this third reading, find out
who’s who. Also check on the speaker, or the “I” in the poem. (Remember, however,
that not every poem has a speaker.) What can you determine about the identity of the
speaker? Can you find any other people in the poem? What do you know about those
folks?

69
Chapter 5: Unraveling Poetic Meaning
Poets often write from personal experience, but they reserve the right to invent charac-
ters, even when they’re using first person (the “I, me, my” form). In other words, don’t
confuse the poet with the speaker.
6. Identify the setting and situation.
Not all poems have a distinct setting, but some do. To get a thorough understanding of
the poem, as you read, ask “where,” “when,” and “what’s going on.”
Applying the steps to a classic poem
Now that you know what steps to take, it’s time to see them in action. For starters, read the
following poem, “To Lucasta, Going to the Wars” by Richard Lovelace, a 17th-century poet:
Tell me not, Sweet, I am unkind,
That from the nunnery
Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind,
To war and arms I fly.
True, a new mistress now I chase,
The first foe in the field;
And with a stronger faith embrace
A sword, a horse, a shield.
Yet this inconstancy is such
As you too shall adore;
I could not love thee, dear, so much,
Loved I not honor more.
To analyze this poem, apply the steps I gave you earlier. Here’s a quick rundown of what to do:
1. Glance through the poem, searching for words that are new to you.
Some words that might be new to you include “inconstancy” (disloyalty), “nunnery” (a
place where nuns live), or “chaste” (pure). Now that you know the vocabulary in the
poem, you can proceed to Step 2.
2. Review punctuation and the breakup of text.
You can see that each stanza, or grouping of lines in a poem, is one complete sentence.
Now you know that you’re looking for a complete, separate thought in each stanza. The
semicolons in the second and third stanzas subdivide each of those complete thoughts
into two smaller units. To decode the poem, examine each separate thought in turn.
3. Consider the syntax in the poem.
Line 1, for example, is fairly conventional. The verb is “tell” and the subject is an implied
“you” because the sentence is giving a command. The only word in a strange spot is
“not,” but you can easily see that “tell me not” is the equivalent of “don’t tell me.”
After line 1, the syntax is more unusual but still accessible. Simply look for the next
verb, which is “fly” (line 4). The subject is “I.” Now you have a base (“I fly”) to hang the
other words on. Where do I fly? “To war and arms” (line 4). From where? “I fly from the
nunnery / Of thy chaste breast and quiet mind.” Now you’ve cracked the first stanza,
except for the word “That” (line 2). You may expect it to belong to the first line, which
would then read “Tell me not, Sweet, that I am unkind.” However, the comma after
“unkind” hints at a break. So, “That” belongs to lines 2–4, where it means “because.”

(05)
(10)

70
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
The first line of the second stanza contains the verb “chase,” which is easily paired
with the subject “I.” So what is the “I” chasing? A new mistress. The next verb in this
stanza is “embrace,” but no subject leaps into view. Reread the stanza. Who’s going to
embrace? The only possibility is the “I” of line 5. What does the “I” embrace? A sword,
a horse, a shield. (I hope the speaker has unusually long arms.) The only words left to
figure out in this stanza are in the phrase “the first foe in the field.” The semicolon tells
you that lines 5 and 6 are lumped together, so the first foe in the field must be the
speaker’s new mistress.
In the third stanza, the first subject-verb combo is “you shall adore.” What shall “you”
adore? Inconstancy. Why? The clue here is “such,” which means you should expect a
description or a qualifier for the meaning of inconstancy. Bringing it all home, the last
two lines explain the meaning of “such.” Start with the subject-verb combo in line 11: 
“I could not love.” (Grammatically speaking, “not” isn’t part of the verb, but don’t quib-
ble. It belongs with the verb to make the meaning clear.) The second verb, “loved,” is
missing a subject, but the “I” stretches to cover this verb too. The tricky word in the
last line is “not,” which isn’t in its usual spot before the verb. Unscramble the order
and add some implied words, and you see that the last line means “if I didn’t love.”
4. Bring everything together and paraphrase the poem.
Paraphrased, the poem says something like this:
• Stanza 1: Don’t tell me, sweetheart, that I am unkind because I am going away
from the nunnery of your pure breast and quiet mind. I am going to war.
• Stanza 2: True, I have a new mistress to chase now. The new mistress is the first
enemy I find in the field of battle. I am embracing a sword, a horse, and a shield
with a stronger faith.
• Stanza 3: However, you will appreciate my disloyalty because of what motivates
it. I could not love you the way I do if I didn’t love honor more.
5. Find out who’s present in the poem.
The speaker is a man who’s leaving the one he loves in order to go to war. The other
person in the poem is “Lucasta,” whose name appears only in the title.
6. Determine any facts about the setting and situation.
The poem doesn’t tell you much about the situation. You never find out which wars
he’s going to, where Lucasta lives, or how she reacts to her lover’s comments. But in
this situation, it’s okay because you already know the basic, literal meaning of “To
Lucasta, Going to the Wars.”
Not many poems yield their literal meaning on one reading. Look over the poem two or three
times until you’re sure you know what the poem says. Don’t give up if a portion of the poem
is unclear. You may be able to answer most exam questions even if you haven’t nailed every
single idea.
Unearthing Deeper Meanings in Poetry
The “poem” in the average greeting card may be touching in its sentiment. It may sound
pretty, and it will certainly look nice. However, I doubt that a greeting-card poem has any-
thing below its surface. What you see is what you get. The sort of poetry you encounter on
the AP exam, on the other hand, has a secret life. Poets work at least partly from their sub-
conscious, reaching into that magic spot that’s also home to dreams. Like dreams, poems
may contain symbols, odd juxtapositions, and strange images. And, like dreams, a poem
won’t yield its deeper meaning until you give up logic and allow yourself to make some intu-
itive leaps from one idea to another.

Don’t be dismayed. Unearthing the deeper meaning of a poem isn’t a nightmare. A couple of
simple techniques, which I explain in the following sections, serve as ladders to take you
down the hatch.
Some techniques work better than others, depending on the poem that you’re reading. Go
with whichever technique is most productive. And if you hit a dead end, try a different
approach.
Checking connotations and double meanings
Emotions, ideas, and attitudes latch onto words. If these qualities influence how the word is
understood, you’re talking about connotation. For instance, many people over 65 years old call
themselves “seniors” rather than “old” because for them “old” has negative connotations — a
sense of being irrelevant, physically impaired, or over the hill. (I’m not 65 yet, but when I get
there, I plan to use the term “experienced.”) To make your life even more miserable, connota-
tions may change over time. What was once a compliment or a neutral remark may now have
a negative connotation. For example, “gossip” originally meant a gathering of women. The
connotation was positive, in the sense of females helping each other (through childbirth, 
for example.) Nowadays, “gossip” carries another meaning, as in I heard that he said that she
liked . . . well, you know what I mean.
The easiest way to see what a connotation brings to the poem is to substitute other words
with the same definition or denotation. If the line reads, “this old pair,” think how the effect
would be different if it were “these two senior citizens.” 
Double meanings are important, also. The poem “To Lucasta, Going to Wars” that’s discussed
earlier in the chapter contains the word “arms.” Literally, the speaker is talking about arma-
ments (bows and arrows, swords, spit balls, water balloons, or whatever else they fought
with back then). However, “Lucasta” also has arms, and presumably she has used them to
hug her lover.
Applying free association
In my work as an English teacher, I probably do more with free association — a technique
borrowed from Freud, where random thoughts are linked and analyzed — than the average
psychoanalyst. Free association can tear down writer’s block (see Chapter 3) and can help
your reading by uncovering meaning in all sorts of writing. To that end, it’s especially helpful
when you’re reading poetry. Here’s how it works:
1. Select a couple of important words from the poem.
You know a word is important if it shows up several times, if it surprises you, or if it
occupies a key position (close to the beginning or the end of a line). On a piece of
scrap paper or in the margin of the test booklet, write the words you’ve chosen. Leave
some room around each.
2. Concentrate on the word and write down the ideas that pop into your mind.
When jotting down your ideas, don’t bother with sentences or punctuation. Keep your
comments short; write just enough to remind you of the thought.
3. Reread what you’ve written.
Do any of the ideas relate to the poem? If so, they become part of the meaning.

Chapter 5: Unraveling Poetic Meaning

Part II: Poetry in Motion 
Figure 5-1 is an example of a free association to the word “honor” from “To Lucasta, Going to
the Wars.” Here are some of the words that I jotted down around the word “honor,” along
with the reasons why:
 “Male and female roles”: I wrote this because way back when Lovelace wrote this
poem, honor had different implications for men and women. I wrote “virtue” to repre-
sent the association of honor with Lucasta’s purity and virginity, because in Lovelace’s
time much emphasis was placed on a woman’s virginal state. Therefore “honor” in line
12 relates to the words “nunnery” (line 2) and “chaste” (line 3). These ideas contrast
with “inconstancy” (line 9).
 “Religion”: When jotting down “religion,” I thought about the many religious rules that
govern sexuality. That idea led me to write “sex,” which relates to the word “breast”
(line 3). However, in the poem “breast” is paired with “chaste,” so the implication is
that the speaker has sought comfort with Lucasta, not sex.
 “Active/passive” and “defend honor”: When associated with men, honor links with
fighting because traditionally — and certainly in Lovelace’s era — it fell to the men to
defend their honor and the honor of their loved ones by fighting or “going to wars,”
(which is obviously a phrase found in the title of the poem). This association led me 
to think about how men took action to uphold their honor, in contrast to women, who
were to refrain from action; that is, they were obligated to remain virginal. Thus in this
poem, the speaker is going to war, and Lucasta is supposed to understand his actions
and remain pure, presumably waiting for him.
Figure 5-1 represents just one possible free association from “To Lucasta, Going to the Wars.”
Your free association to “honor” may be completely different from mine and still be valid.
You can extract even more from the poem by free-associating to other words. My choices for
the next most interesting and important words are “fly” (line 4) and “faith” (line 7). “Fly” may
open up the whole idea of freedom, and “faith” may deepen the religious parallels in the
poem. Free-associate and see what you come up with. The “big ideas” in the poem, by the
way, are themes. The speaker in Lovelace’s poem is saying goodbye to his lover, but the
poem deals with the themes of honor, freedom, and faithfulness.
Visualizing
When you’re reading a poem, you may visualize, or play a film clip in your head so that you
can “see” the poem. Don’t visualize only the “real” scenes described in the poem. Also visual-
ize the scenes evoked by comparisons, especially similes (comparisons with the words “like”
or “as”) and metaphors (comparisons without “like” or “as”). Add the sounds, smells, and tac-
tile sensations to your visualization. When you visualize the poem, its meaning may become
clearer to you.

ation.

Take a look at this William Wordsworth poem, “She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways,” while
you visualize what you read:
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove.
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love;
A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye!
Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky.
She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave, and, oh,
The difference to me!
This poem isn’t the most complicated one ever written, but even so Wordsworth packed
extra ideas into these 12 lines. After reading the poem, conjure up the scene in your imagina-
tion: Picture “untrodden ways” (line 1) — paths so remote that no one walks on them. See
the “springs of Dove” (line 2), perhaps some water bubbling nicely. (“Dove” is the name of a
couple of rivers in England, but you don’t need to worry about that fact.) Now add the “violet
by a mossy stone” (line 5). The stone’s been sitting there a long time, so in your mental pic-
ture, make the stone look untouched and permanent. Visualize the hard rock and the delicate
flowers next to each other. Then paint in a sky with just one star.
What does your whole mental picture now show you? You probably see a natural scene,
something pretty and fragile (like the violets), and something that will never change (like the
stone). You probably also see something that’s unique — the fact that there’s only one star in
the night sky.
At this point, you now know what this “Maid” (line 3) means to the speaker: Lucy is natural,
pretty, and unique. She’s also dead, because she’s “in her grave” (line 11), a permanent state
echoed by the “mossy stone” (line 5). Her life was fragile, as violets are. The nature images
reinforce the theme that life and death are natural elements of life. The single star (line 7) ele-
vates this simple girl; because she’s unique, Lucy can’t be replaced.
Listening
On the AP exam, you can’t read the poem aloud, but you can “hear” it in your head. Listen for
words that stand out. Determine why those words are important. Also, identify sound pat-
terns, if any are present. How does the pattern affect the reader/listener? Pay special atten-
tion to repeated sounds. Words that share sounds (rhymes or repeated letters) are linked.
Determine whether those links reinforce or change the meaning.

Read the poem “She Dwelt Among the Untrodden Ways,” which appears in the previous sec-
tion, aloud, or listen to it with your inner voice. The first thing you hear is that the poem has
a regular, not an erratic, sound. Each stanza has four lines, with rhymes in the first and third
lines and the second and fourth lines. In the first stanza, for example, “ways” (line 1) rhymes
with “praise” (line 3) and “Dove” (line 2) rhymes with “love” (line 4). The only variation is in
the second stanza, because “stone” isn’t a perfect match for “one,” but it’s close enough. You
may also notice that the first and third lines of each stanza are a bit longer than the second
and fourth. Taken all together, you hear a song-like quality. The poem sounds simple and nat-
ural, qualities that Lucy has. (Check out Chapter 4 for more details on how poets use sound
to manipulate their poems.)
Considering Context and Point of View
A good way to split the shell of a poem and allow more hidden meaning to spill forth is to
consider context and point of view. By context I mean when the poem was written and in
what situation. The AP exam writers are fairly discreet when it comes to context. They 
rarely tell you the name of the author or say anything about the selection other than “read
this poem carefully.” But, because you have reading experience, you may be able to infer
more or less when something was written, and some of the references in the poem may 
help you determine the situation surrounding the poem.
For example, earlier in this chapter, I consider the traditional male and female roles in inter-
preting “To Lucasta, Going to the Wars.” That context deepens the meaning of the poem.
Here’s another example: I know a thing or two about the Elizabethan era, when a big deal was
made of “courtly love” (an idealized relationship that was never meant to come down to who
does the dishes every night). Hence when I read an Elizabethan poem, I don’t assume that
lovers are married. In fact, I assume that they aren’t.
Context can help you understand what you’re reading, but unless you’re sure, don’t bring too
much to the poem. If you’re off by a hundred years or assume the wrong author, you may be
completely wrong in your reading of the poem.
Coming to terms with poetic language
English teachers are English teachers because they love
language. Is it any wonder that they’ve coined a few
words of their own? Literary terms abound when you’re
studying poetry, and if used properly, these terms warm
the hearts of AP essay graders. However, even the most
obsessed English teachers realize that students usually
don’t want to acquire a specialized vocabulary that’s
hardly ever useful at parties. After all, if you say, “Let me
tell you about that asyndeton I read yesterday,” the room
will clear more quickly than if you say, “A rabid dog just
walked in.”
Literary terminology is fading fast on the AP exam.
Therefore, I stick to the most common literary terms. 
Still, feel free to throw in words such as asyndeton
wherever you wish. You don’t know what asyndeton is?
Congratulations. You have a life. I don’t, so I can define it.
Asyndeton is the omission of conjunctions, words such
as “and” that traditionally tie ideas together. “I sweated,
I persevered, I scored a five on the AP exam” is an exam-
ple of asyndeton. Aren’t you sorry you asked?
Much more important than throwing around literary
vocabulary is understanding the poem and, in the essay,
communicating what you’ve gleaned from the text. In the
multiple-choice section, of course, the most important
thing to do is to come up with the right answer, which I can
pretty much guarantee will never be asyndeton. But, it may
be something more basic, such as personification, which
is the attribution of human traits to nonhuman elements.

Point of view in poetry is also important, and it usually shows up in the following ways:
 If the poem has a speaker, you get his or her point of view.
 If you encounter other characters whose points of view differ from that of the speaker,
you get their points of view.
 The poet may reveal his or her own point of view.
In Robert Browning’s “My Last Duchess,” for instance, the speaker is a Duke who had his
wife, the Duchess, murdered because she smiled at everyone equally and didn’t appreciate
his “nine-hundred-years-old name.” The poet conveys the Duke’s tone of jealousy and pride,
and you easily pick up the poet’s condemnation of the monstrous speaker. The other charac-
ters in the poem are the Duchess, who appears only in a portrait on the wall looking “as if
she were alive.” You also run across an implied listener, who’s visiting the Duke to make
arrangements for the Duke’s next marriage to the daughter of his employer, the Count. You
can infer much about the Duchess from the Duke’s comments, especially his criticisms of his
dead wife. However, you don’t get direct information about her point of view or the point of
view of the marriage emissary, which I hope for the sake of the Count’s daughter was highly
unfavorable.
Bringing Your Own Experience to the Poem
A poem, according to many poets, is only partly finished when it reaches the page. The
reader’s reaction, which includes everything in the reader’s life that helps him or her relate
to the poem, is also part of the meaning. Recalling similar experiences may help you under-
stand what the poet is getting at.
Going out on a limb, I’m going to guess that you’ve never hired a hit man or been murdered
by an ego-tripping Duke. Nevertheless, you’ve probably met a snob or encountered jealousy
at some point in your life. When you read Browning’s poem, “My Last Duchess” (see the dis-
cussion in the preceding section), you can bring that snobbery or jealousy into your reading
of the poem. You may, perhaps, have made a sarcastic comment about the Big Man on
Campus who wouldn’t shake hands because he didn’t want to ruin his manicure. Your per-
sonal experience with sarcasm can help you see that Browning isn’t presenting a grieving
husband and a pretty picture of his dead duchess. Instead, he’s showing you the nut case
who murdered her and the attitude of snobbery that nurtured the Duke’s egomania.
Be careful when you apply your own life experiences to a poem. Your experiences may be 
an entryway into the poem, but in the end, the work itself must contain enough evidence to
support your interpretation. Take care to differentiate what you’re bringing to the poem and
what the text actually says.

 Surveying multiple-choice poetry questions
 Creating a strategy for each type of question
I
n a perfect world, one where homework is illegal, the AP English Literature and
Composition exam wouldn’t contain even one multiple-choice poetry question. Instead,
test-takers would read beautiful poetry and write about it. The problem with multiple-
choice poetry questions is simple. It’s possible to come up with a great — and valid — 
interpretation of a poem and not find a single answer in the five choices that matches your
idea. Then what do you do?
Panic! No, just kidding. To avoid running into this problem on the test, you simply need to
read this chapter. It helps you examine the most common types of AP English multiple-choice
poetry questions, pick up on the College Board lingo, and acquire strategies that maximize
your score. (The basics — how many questions, how much time, and so on — are explained
in Chapter 1.)
One point to note before you dive in: If you’ve read ahead, you may notice that the terminol-
ogy that I use to describe the types of poetry questions in this chapter is the same as that in
Chapter 11, but I’ve placed some terms in different categories. The reason? The questions
that the College Board asks about poetry differ greatly from those that they ask about prose
and drama. For example, most poetry syntax questions query you about meaning, perhaps
because the meaning of poetry is sometimes difficult to grasp. In prose and drama, syntax
questions usually revolve around the reason an author chose a particular syntax. The defini-
tion of syntax doesn’t vary, but the questions about syntax do. 
The Devil’s in the Details: Factual Questions
Many of the poetry multiple-choice questions test simple reading comprehension and atten-
tion to detail, not interpretation. If you read carefully, the factual questions will breeze by as
you darken oval after oval, each with the correct answer. This section deals with how to
grasp the facts, all the facts, and nothing but the facts.
Reading comprehension: Extracting details
Lucky for you, quite a few questions on the AP English Lit exam ask nothing more than the
meaning of a particular line. Granted, sometimes that line is no picnic. After all, it may con-
tain hidden meanings (Chapter 5 helps you in this area) or weird vocabulary (see the next
section). But your normal, everyday reading ability will get you to the correct answer more

often than you think, because the questions are most times pretty straightforward; you just
need to know how to take them apart and examine all the pieces. Check out this excerpt from
Byron’s poem Don Juan:
Don José and his lady quarreled — why,
Not any of the many could divine,
Though several thousand people chose to try,
’Twas surely no concern of theirs nor mine;
I loath that low vice — curiosity;
But if there’s anything in which I shine,
’Tis in arranging all my friends’ affairs,
Not having, of my own, domestic cares.
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
Line 3 may be restated in which way?
(A) No one cared about the quarrel.
(B) The quarrel’s origins were well-known.
(C) The couple’s quarrel was the subject of much speculation.
(D) The couple confided in their friends.
(E) Everyone sided with either Don José or his wife.
Byron’s poem is proof that gossip didn’t begin with the Internet. Byron, who was as popular
with the media of his own time as Brad Pitt is with modern journalists, understood celebrity.
And this stanza of his poem mocks people who say they aren’t interested in gossip. Answer-
ing the sample question calls for basic decoding skills. Check out the details in line 3, which
tells you that “several thousand people” were discussing the couple and “chose to try” to
figure out why Don José had a fight with his wife. Therefore the quarrel was the subject of
“much speculation.” (For a thorough review of methods that help you grasp the literal mean-
ing of a poem, turn to Chapter 5.)
Decoding poems also goes hand in hand with vocabulary and syntax, which I discuss in the
next two sections.
Vocabulary: Examining individual words
Poets are like kids in a sandbox surrounded by toys, only the toys are words — big words,
little words, unusual words, and even made-up words. Maybe that’s the reason vocabulary is
often queried on the AP exam. The College Board wants to know that you can work your way
through a difficult text and grasp the meaning of a word in context.
Questions that quiz your knowledge of literary terminology are becoming quite rare on the
AP exam. However, they aren’t totally extinct yet, so keep your eyes peeled. You may see a
question asking which figure of speech appears in the poem or, more commonly, which figure
of speech does not appear. Either way, you have to know the vocabulary to answer the ques-
tion. (See Chapter 4 for a quick review of poetry-related vocab.)

Deciphering definitions in the context of a poem
One or two questions per selection generally ask for the meaning of a word in the context of a
particular line. I italicized the bit about context because, as Hamlet says, “There’s the rub”:
You may know a large percentage of the English language, but poets rejoice in bending lan-
guage into word pretzels. And, as you can guess, exam writers rejoice just as heartily in
bending answers (A) through (E) into word puzzles.
You have one point in your favor: Unusual or extremely difficult words are defined in foot-
notes, so you don’t have to know, for instance, what a zither is. (It’s a musical instrument, 
in case you’re curious.) The words that the AP exam asks about are easier, though the ques-
tions aren’t. Don’t assume that the first definition that pops into your mind is the correct
answer. The exam writers like to throw in five true definitions of the word they’re asking
about. The problem is that only one of those definitions is accurate in the context of the
poem. Substitution is a good strategy for these cases. Look at the indicated line and restate 
it in your own words, inserting your own definition. Then check the five possible choices 
and choose the one that comes closest to the word you selected when you paraphrased.
If nothing matches your first attempt at paraphrasing, turn to your fund of real-world knowl-
edge and try again. Suppose a line reads “gribbling in pain, her elbow was now in her eye and
then in her nose.” I made up the word gribbling, so don’t be shocked if it’s unfamiliar. Even
though you can’t know what gribbling means, you do know how people act when they’re in
pain. They may, for instance, groan, contort their bodies, or cry. If the elbow is moving
around, contorting (or twisting) is the probable definition. Look at the choices, and find one
that matches those ideas.
Check out this excerpt from Edward Arlington Robinson’s poem, “Credo”:
I cannot find my way: there is no star
In all the shrouded heavens anywhere;
And there is not a whisper in the air
Of any living voice but one so far
That I can hear it only as a bar
Of lost, imperial music, played when fair
And angel fingers wove, and unaware,
Dead garlands where no roses are.
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
The word “bar” in line 5 may best be defined as
(A) a place that serves drinks
(B) an impediment
(C) a musical measure
(D) a metal rod
(E) a stripe
All of the choices correctly define the word “bar,” but only choice (C) fits the context. You
may know nothing about music except how to download it, but the words surrounding “bar,”
such as “Of lost, imperial music,” take you to the correct answer. The real-world method also
helps in this case. For example, you’ve probably seen sheet music somewhere, even if only
on television or in the movies. And so, you probably know that the notes are divided into
sections, or bars, which you can measure.
79
Chapter 6: Acing Multiple-Choice Poetry Questions
(01)
(05)

A question may appear to address vocabulary but instead deal with another, completely dif-
ferent issue such as figurative language, tone, or attitude. For instance, suppose you see the
following question based on the previous poem “Credo.”
Which of the following best expresses the meaning of “shrouded” (line 2)?
(A) a cloth that covers the dead
(B) grief
(C) cloudy
(D) mysterious
(E) cotton
A “shroud” is a covering for the dead, but Arlington Robinson isn’t talking about a literal
shroud. If you chose (A) or (B), you fell into that trap. Choice (B) may entice you because the
poem is sad, but line 2 deals more directly with the appearance of the sky. (D) is tempting,
but the poem refers to an absence of stars, which makes the night dark but not necessarily
mysterious. (E) isn’t supported by any details in the poem. Go for (C), because Arlington
Robinson’s “shrouded heavens” is a figure of speech describing a cloudy, starless night.
(Check out “Finding value in figures of speech” later in this chapter for the best approach 
to these types of questions.)
Considering the meanings of the answer options
Some questions that challenge your vocabulary aren’t asking about words in the poem.
Instead, the question is worded simply and the answers contain the difficult vocabulary.
The mood of lines 1–8 is best described as
(A) elegiac
(B) optimistic
(C) aggressive
(D) nostalgic
(E) rueful
Okay, vocabulary fans, time to go to work. The best answer is (A). “Elegiac” comes from
elegy, a lament for the dead. When you read the complete poem, you grasp the speaker’s
grief easily, but you can’t answer the question unless you know the meaning of elegiac.
In this sort of question where the answers are more difficult to understand than the question,
context or real-world knowledge is no help. You either know the word or you don’t. Your best
strategy is to eliminate answers that are clearly wrong. If you can cross off two or three, take
a guess. Otherwise, skip the question entirely.
Syntax: Singling out grammatical structure
Syntax questions contain an element of revenge. Didn’t pay attention when your teacher was
droning on and on about pronouns? Wham! Here’s your punishment: Explain the meaning of
“that” in line 84. And that will teach you to call grammar irrelevant!
Okay, maybe the exam writers’ intentions aren’t exactly as I describe. In fact, the revenge may
be purely accidental. However, syntax, the grammatical structure of the writing, is most defi-
nitely relevant and important. If you don’t understand syntax, you may not be able to under-
stand a poem. However, if you can decode the poem, you can often answer a syntax question
with no trouble at all, simply by relying on your understanding of what the poem actually says.
80
Part II: Poetry in Motion 

Here’s the great secret about syntax: You don’t have to remember all the definitions that your
sixth-grade teacher threw at you. Syntax questions can be answered purely on the basis of
logic and reading comprehension. (For more help with decoding skills, flip to Chapter 5.)
Syntax questions tend to focus on a couple of grammatical principles that you can remember
without all the fancy terminology. Here’s a list of bare-bones examples showing common
types of questions and how to answer them:
 What is the subject of the verb _____ (line X)? Ask yourself who or what is doing the
action described by the verb in the blank. Or, in the case of a “be” verb (is, are, was,
were, has been, and so on), ask yourself who or what is in the state of being expressed
by the verb in the blank. The answer is the subject.
 The subject _____ (line X) may be paired with which verb? Ask yourself “What is the
word in the blank doing?” or “In what state of being is the word in the blank?” The
answer is the verb.
 What does the pronoun _____ (line X) refer to? Other versions of this question ask
about the pronouns “which,” “that,” or “who.” To answer this type of question, untan-
gle the units of thought in the sentence. Attention to punctuation, if the poet uses any,
pays off. Semicolons and periods divide major units from one another, and so the pro-
noun probably refers to something in the same unit. If the author of the selection is
playful with punctuation marks, try using logic. Figure out what statement is being
made about the pronoun and then find something in the poem that matches.
 The structure of the sentence in lines X–Y serves to . . . This sort of question pops up
when the structure is unusual. The subject may follow the verb, for instance. This pat-
tern stresses the importance of the subject (“arrived the honored guest” emphasizes
“guest,” for example). The sentence may include a number of similar structural ele-
ments. You may see something like “I sang and I danced and I ran away with the drum-
mer.” The repetition of “I-verb” elements may equate these actions, making each
equally important. Or, in another context, the repetition may create rising tension. 
 The statements beginning with _____ in lines X and Y describe . . . When you come
across these questions, you have another reading comprehension issue on your hands;
your best bet is to attack this type of question with logic. If the syntax is really compli-
cated, remember that punctuation helps. You may see a bunch of commas around
descriptions, and descriptions are usually in the same unit of thought as the word they
describe. Periods and semicolons separate major thoughts.
Read this excerpt, from an Emily Dickinson poem, and then try the sample syntax question:
I said, but just to be a bee
Upon a raft of air,
And row in nowhere all day long,
And anchor off the bar, —
What liberty! So captives deem
Who tight in dungeons are.
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
The word “So” (line 5) refers to
(A) dungeons
(B) the act of rowing
(C) the act of anchoring
(D) the way captives think about liberty
(E) a bee

If you’re grammar-savvy, you know that “so” is an adverb that describes the verb “deem,”
which means “think” or “consider.” (Fortunately, the terms “adverb” and “verb” aren’t essen-
tial for nailing this question!) The word “So” in this sentence means “in this way.” Therefore,
the last sentence may be restated more simply as “Captives who are tight in dungeons think
in this way.” Just before this last sentence is “What liberty!” (line 5). Put these two ideas
together and you know that choice (D) is the correct answer.
What Lies Beneath: Interpretation Questions
If AP English Lit multiple-choice questions stayed with the facts, the “what” and “who” of 
the poem, your life would be a lot simpler. Sadly, you also have to answer “why” and “how.”
These high-end questions move beyond fact into interpretation, querying the purpose, 
effect, and implied meaning created by poetic techniques such as imagery, diction, tone, 
and structure. These questions sound tough, but with the explanations of these techniques
in the following sections, you’ll be a pro in no time.
Considering the significance 
of sensations: Imagery
Imagery questions sit in the gap between literature and reality. In reality, thousands upon
thousands of sensory impressions fill every single second of our lives. No poet can — or
wants to — include them all. Instead, poets select the details that reinforce their meanings 
or themes (the ideas that a poet is pondering).
When you come across an imagery question, ask yourself “why.” Why, for instance, does the
poet use this detail and not another? Also ask yourself “how.” How would a poem be different
if a lion replaced the spider that’s currently discussed in the poem? After you understand
why and how the imagery functions, you can grasp the meaning that the imagery conveys.
Imagery questions resemble the following:
 The description in lines 14–18 serves to _____. Take the description out and read
what’s left. How has the meaning changed? Or consider substituting a different descrip-
tion. What else changes in the poem when you substitute descriptions? For example, a
description of the speaker’s ramshackle hut may emphasize poverty. If the poet had
omitted the hut and instead focused on a description of a modern school attended by
the speaker, the focus might shift to ambition or possibility.
 The shift in imagery between the second and third stanzas may be characterized 
by . . . Ah, shifts. The College Board exam writers love shifts! Here’s how to take care of
these questions: Take a look at the stanzas that you’re provided, and then underline
the imagery in the second stanza (or whatever stanza that you’re analyzing). What do
you see, hear, smell, and taste? Now underline the imagery in the third stanza (or the
next stanza that you’re supposed to be analyzing). What’s the difference between the
two sets of imagery? Has the author shifted from “ocean-clouds” to “clear blue sky”? If
so, then perhaps the poet is shifting from pessimism to optimism. Make two lists in
your head (you won’t have time to write much) and compare.
 Throughout the poem, the imagery suggests that . . . As you do for an imagery shift,
first pick out and underline the images. Substitute something different for the images
and see how the poem changes. Now you probably know what the original imagery
adds to the poem. You can also visualize or use free association (see Chapter 5) to
unpack the deeper meaning of the imagery.

Part II: Poetry in Motion 

 The _____ is characterized primarily by . . . Depending on the poem, the answer may
be imagery, dialogue, the speaker’s reaction to whatever’s in the blank, or any number
of things. Ask yourself what you know about the word in the blank and then ask how
you know it. If, for example, the blank contains the word “elephant” and the elephant’s
“rough gray skin,” “lumbering gait,” and “moist, prehensile trunk” dominate the poem,
the answer is imagery.
 The purpose of lines 20–23 is to . . . If the lines are filled with imagery, the purpose
may be simply to create a scene or to describe a person or object. However, even if
you’re dealing with straight description, the description may have another, deeper
reason for being there. In this case, look for answers such as “to show the value of the
vase” or “to create a sense of foreboding.”
Take a look at this excerpt from “Misgivings,” a poem by Herman Melville, and then try your
hand at the sample question following it:
When ocean-clouds over inland hills
Sweep storming in late autumn brown,
And horror the sodden valley fills,
And the spire falls crashing in the town,
I muse upon my country’s ills. . . .
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
The imagery in lines 1–3
(A) creates a sense of foreboding
(B) emphasizes the conflict between human beings and nature
(C) contrasts with the state of the nation
(D) heightens the drama of the spire’s crash
(E) creates a feeling of peace
The imagery in the first three lines is all about nature, but it isn’t the nature of a cheerful
child’s story or a rosy greeting card. After all, why have “ocean-clouds” (line 1) moved over
“inland hills” (line 1)? I’m not a meteorologist, but when clouds from the ocean hit land, I
know a storm is approaching. These clouds are a warning of bad weather to come. The next
image in the poem is “late autumn brown” (line 2). How would the poem be different if the
line read “early spring green”? Spring is associated with birth and with the beginning of the
growing cycle. Autumn, on the other hand, is associated with the end of the growing cycle
and the approach of winter, a symbol of death. This leads us to another negative image.
Finally, check out the last image regarding the “valley” (line 3). You don’t need to ask why 
the valley is “sodden” (line 3) because the “storming” (line 2) is clearly the cause. But why 
is it filled with “horror” (line 3)? If the valley had been filled with “joy” or “peace,” the poem
would have a very different meaning. All these factors add up to “foreboding,” which means
that choice (A) is the best.
Finding value in figures of speech
Figurative language, the parts of which are often called figures of speech, arises from the
poet’s imagination, so you need to employ your own imagination in answering questions
about these elements. The exam writers, for example, may ask the meaning, purpose, or
effect of a figure of speech — a simile, a metaphor, a symbol, personification, and the like.
However, don’t expect to see the term “figurative language” or the name of a particular figure
of speech in the question. Instead, the questions simply ask for an interpretation of a few
words from the poem.

Here are a few common figurative language questions and some info on what to do when you
run into one:
 Which poetic technique does NOT appear in the poem? This type of question throws
lots of terms at you. To answer one of these beauties, put on your catcher’s mitt and
work through the list of five, crossing off everything that you can find in the poem.
 The second stanza relies on which poetic technique to convey the solemnity of the
occasion? To figure out the answer to this tricky question, reread your stanza to deter-
mine what’s there. Then match your answer to the list of possible answers, which may
contain figures of speech (symbols, metaphors, and so on) or other poetic techniques.
(For more on figures of speech, see Chapter 4.)
 The poet’s attitude toward _____ is revealed primarily by . . . How does the poet 
feel about whatever is written in the blank, and how do you know what he or she feels? 
This is actually a question about tone (see the next section), but I’ve included it here
because your answer may be a figure of speech. (Your answer may be something 
else, of course — imagery, perhaps.)
 The expression _____ in line X refers to . . . This sort of question is easy because all
you have to do is untangle the simile.
 The speaker characterizes love as . . . You may be in figurative-language territory here
if the speaker has used figures of speech to convey a definition of love. Of course, the
speaker may have ranted on and on about love, in which case your best answer may be
“dialogue” or “dramatic monologue.” Regardless, dust off your reading comprehension
skills and you’re home free.
Check out the following lines from a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, and then try your
hand at the sample question:
Pride and humiliation hand in hand
Walked with them through the world where’er they went;
Trampled and beaten were they as the sand,
And yet unshaken as the continent.
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
The references to “sand” (line 3) and “continent” (line 4)
(A) express the suffering endured by “them” (line 2)
(B) contrast transience and permanence
(C) reveal the strength with which hardship was faced by “them” (line 2)
(D) emphasize a natural reaction to pride and humiliation
(E) create a setting for the events in the poem
Rearrange the words in line 3 to make the simile clear: They were as trampled and beaten as
the sand. It isn’t very difficult to see that the poet is talking about suffering. But before you
latch onto (A), keep reading. The sand simile also relates to the “hardship” mentioned in
choice (C). Now add the implied words to line 4 to check the other simile: They were as
“unshaken as the continent.” Here you find the “strength” of choice (C), which makes (C) the
winner over (A). Notice that nobody (except me) mentioned the word “simile,” and yet the
basic idea of comparison is used. Nevertheless, this is a question about figurative language.

It’s not just what you say, but how 
you say it: Tone and diction
The College Board is so hooked on how poets express themselves that it recently published
a booklet for educators explaining how to teach tone (the author’s attitude toward his or her
topic or theme) in various works of literature. The AP English Lit exam is also rife with ques-
tions about diction, or word choice, which conveniently helps you to determine the tone of a
selection. (Flip to Chapter 4 for a more detailed explanation of tone and diction.)
Tone and diction show up on the AP exam in questions such as these:
 What attitude does the poet display toward . . . To best answer this question, you
need to check diction and direct, literal statements. Also examine figures of speech.
(See the previous section for more info on how figures of speech help determine tone.)
 It can be inferred from the poem that the author . . . Inference questions like these
turn you into Sherlock Holmes. The answers to these questions shouldn’t be some-
thing that’s actually stated in the poem. Instead, they should be something that’s
hinted at — the logical conclusion that always makes the great detective exclaim,
“Elementary, my dear Watson.” Go for the clues in the usual way (visualize, employ
free-association, check connotation, and so forth), digging under the surface. 
(Chapter 5 explains in detail how to excavate for clues.)
Don’t confuse the poet with the speaker or the other characters (if any appear in the
poem). Tone questions are about the poet’s attitude, which may differ markedly from
the speaker’s or characters’.
 In line 9, the poem shifts from . . . Depending on what’s going on in line 9 and what
was going on in lines 1–8, this question may have all sorts of answers. Be sure to check
diction if you see an answer choice such as “formal to informal” or “colloquial to
pedantic” or any words that describe diction. (Pedantic, by the way, means “teacherly”
in the worst possible sense. A pedantic speaker wants to lecture you and impress you
with the number of books he or she has read.) Also check tone; you may detect a shift
from “I hate you for these reasons” to “we had some good times, didn’t we?” You can
have any number of possibilities.
 Lines 3–9 reveal . . . Again, the content of these lines tells you whether this question
deals with diction and tone. If you see words such as “ain’t,” “whassup,” and “gimme”
and one of your answer choices is “lack of education,” you know that you’re in diction
territory. And don’t forget that the reasons the author provides for why the character
speaks in a certain way may clue you in to the tone.
 In line 20, the author uses the word “anguish” to . . . Welcome to diction-land! To
breeze through these questions, simply substitute another word, and then examine the
way the poem changes. By substituting you determine what the word “anguish” accom-
plishes.
 The word “beloved” (line 3) is ironic because . . . With this type of question, you first
have to remind yourself that with irony, people don’t say what they mean. Therefore,
the word “beloved” establishes that whatever “beloved” refers to is really hated,
reviled, loathed, and . . . well, you get the point. Now search the poem for reasons, and
then compare those reasons to the choices provided to get your answer.

Chapter 6: Acing Multiple-Choice Poetry Questions

Scan these lines by George Moses Horton, and then try the sample question:
Ha! tott’ring Johnny strut and boast,
But think of what your feathers cost;
Your crowing days are short at most,
You bloom but soon to fade.
Surely you could not stand so wide,
If strictly to the bottom tried;
The wind would blow your plume aside,
If half your debts were paid.
Then boast and bear the crack,
With the Sheriff at your back . . .
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
The tone of this selection may be described as
(A) nostalgic
(B) admiring
(C) regretful
(D) reasonable
(E) critical
The author isn’t a big fan of “tott’ring Johnny” (line 1). How do you know? Look at the dic-
tion. “Strut and boast,” for example, aren’t activities to participate in if you want to have 
any friends. Also, look at the metaphor in line 3: “Your crowing days.” A rooster crows to
announce himself to the world, a kind of bragging. Now look at the poet’s direct statements:
“You bloom but soon to fade” (line 4) and even if you pay half of what you owe, you’ll still
have “the Sheriff at your back” (line 10). Bingo, choice (E) sums up the tone nicely, and dic-
tion helps get you to the correct answer. By the way, the answer makes even more sense
when you know the title of the poem: “The Creditor to His Proud Debtor.”
Reflecting on the whole enchilada: Structure
Structure questions require you to take a step back and consider the poem or the section
that you’re being asked about as a unit. Imagine that you have X-ray vision and are examining
the bones. What unifies the poem? Content? Does the poem tell a story in chronological
order or through flashbacks?
Consider whether the poem is organized by an element of style. For instance, does it present
an idea metaphorically and then restate the idea with additional metaphors? Perhaps you
can discern a rhyme scheme or a repetitious sentence pattern that holds everything
together.
Structure questions may appear in the following forms:
 Lines 5–8 are unified by . . . To get your answer, reread the lines that you’re being
asked about, and then figure out what they have in common. Your answer will be what-
ever it is that the lines share.

 The imagery in the fifth stanza serves to . . . This question is the reverse of the pre-
ceding one. The answer may be “organize” or “unify” or a similar word. If the fifth
stanza were altered, what would change in the poem? How would you perceive the
meaning differently? The answers to these questions help you understand what the
imagery in the fifth stanza accomplishes.
 The structure of the poem . . . This question has lots of possible answers. You may, for
example, see a choice that refers to the rhyme scheme, something such as “has three
quatrains and a couplet.” Or, you may also see an answer that relies on reading com-
prehension (“is based on the speaker’s journey away from his family,” perhaps). Look
for a pattern, and match the effect of that pattern to one of the answer choices.
Read the following part of Edward Arlington Robinson’s famous poem, “Richard Cory,” and
then tackle the sample question:
Whenever Richard Cory went down town,
We people on the pavement looked at him:
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,
Clean favored, and imperially slim.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And he was rich — yes, richer than a king
And admirably schooled in every grace:
In fine, we thought that he was everything
To make us wish that we were in his place.
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,
Went home and put a bullet through his head.
A sample question about a poem such as the preceding one may read like this:
Which best describes the way in which this poem is structured?
(A) It is a series of facts about Richard Cory.
(B) It is a narrative of Richard Cory’s life.
(C) It is a contrast between the attitude of the townspeople and Cory’s true situation.
(D) It is a series of metaphors about wealth.
(E) It is a straightforward assessment of Cory’s condition.
Talk about irony! The townspeople are envious, but apparently they don’t know how Richard
Cory’s life feels from the inside. The last two lines make (C) the only possible choice. Notice
the close-but-no-cigar answer: choice (A). It’s almost there, because a fact about Cory’s life is
the envy of the townspeople, and Cory’s suicide is also a fact about him. However, the poem
revolves around the contrast between the supposedly perfect life the townspeople imagine
for Cory and his despair. Remember: To answer a structure question, always go for the most
specific answer that addresses the big picture.

Getting into the groove (or lack 
thereof): Rhyme and rhythm
Rhyme and rhythm (meter) don’t really show up by themselves in multiple-choice poetry
questions. Like packs of wannabe’s trying to get into the hottest new club, these sound tech-
niques are too insecure to go out alone. Look for them, if they’re around at all, in questions
about structure. For example, the question may concern how a poem is organized, with
rhyme or rhythm (meter) as one of the answers. (Check out the structure discussion in the
preceding section.)
You may also find rhythm or rhyme as one of the possible answers for a question that says
something like “All of the following poetic techniques may be found in this poem EXCEPT. . . .”
Answering this question correctly depends on two things: listening to the poem and knowing
the literary terms that relate to sound. Chapter 4 helps you with both of these issues.
The sound qualities of poetry are especially important in the essay portion of the AP exam.
Most essay prompts based on poetry ask you to relate poetic techniques to content. Because
a lot of test-takers forget about rhythm and rhyme, you’ll stand out from the crowd when you
mention these elements.
Take a “listen” to this excerpt from a poem by Percy Bysshe Shelley:
Sometimes the living by the dead were hid.
Near the great fountain in the public square,
Where corpses made a crumbling pyramid
Under the sun, was heard one stifled prayer
For life, in the hot silence of the air;
And strange ‘twas, amid that hideous heap to see
Some shrouded in their long and golden hair,
As if not dead, but slumbering quietly
Like forms which sculptors carve, then love to agony.
A sample question regarding the sound elements may read like this:
The rhyme scheme of this poem creates a division between which two lines?
(A) 2 and 3
(B) 3 and 4
(C) 4 and 5
(D) 5 and 6
(E) 6 and 7
The answer, of course, depends on the poem’s rhyme scheme (pattern), which may be
expressed this way:
a b a b b c b c c
The sixth line introduces a new sound — “see,” which is repeated in lines 8 and 9 with “qui-
etly” and “agony.” The meaning of the poem also changes between lines 5 and 6. The first five
lines describe a battle scene with truly awful images. The last three lines are poignant, as the
corpses with “long and golden hair” (line 7) appear to be “slumbering quietly” (line 8). The
change of meaning and the change of rhyme show you that the division occurs between lines
5 and 6, which is answer (D).

magine the morning of the worst day ever — the kind of day when the alarm doesn’t go
off, your cat coughs up a hairball on your geometry homework, and you discover that
the last rinse-cycle turned your entire load of laundry the color of raw salmon.
In your imagination, your AP English Literature and Composition exam testing morning,
specifically the moment when you rip off the plastic wrap and open the green essay booklet,
may be just as bad. You don’t care that someone’s immortal poem containing deep and impor-
tant thoughts is sitting right in front of you. All you care about is getting the job done. The job,
in this case, is to read a poem and write an essay demonstrating that you understand the
meaning of the poem and the poetic techniques in it. And all this in 40 minutes or less.
Mission impossible? Nope. The disaster you envision doesn’t have to happen. In this chapter, I
zero in on poetry essays, explaining how to figure out the intention of a poetry prompt (the
two- or three-sentence questions that “prompt” you to write an essay). I discuss how to gather
and prioritize ideas and how to write an introduction, body, and conclusion for your essay. I
also explain how to insert quotations from the poem smoothly and how to punctuate them
properly. So that you can visualize the goal, I provide a sample poem and a polished essay.
Knowing What to Expect from Poetry Prompts
If you were to read a stack of AP poetry prompts, you would notice that the following two
standard elements appear in the prompt for just about every essay:
 “Read the poem.” There’s a shock. You were planning to guess the content of the
poem, right? The variation of this element is “read the poem carefully” or “read the fol-
lowing poem carefully.” Sometimes the exam writers are daring enough to say, “Read
the text carefully.” No matter how they word the prompt, read the entire poem at least
twice — once for an overview, and then again with your mind focused on the question.
As you gather material for the essay, you may read all or part of the poem several more
times. (The later section, “Making Notes and Preparing to Write,” goes into detail on
poetry reading, AP-exam style.)

90
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
 “In a well-organized essay . . .” And here you thought you should just randomly pour
out ideas! You may also see the variation “in a well-written essay . . .” This one makes
me wonder whether some future attorney once protested a grade because “no one ever
said it had to be well written.”
It’s easy to make fun of AP questions, but really, you can see why the exam writers include
this point in poetry prompts. After all, talking about a poem in class or answering a teacher’s
specific question about a poem is different from writing an essay about one. The exam tests
your ability to gather ideas and communicate them clearly in writing. Remember, the test is
called the AP English Literature and Composition exam.
One other item nearly always appears in prompts, and it’s a crucial one. (Look for it and file
it in the brain cell labeled “no-matter-what-don’t-forget-me.”) The basic phrase that I’m talk-
ing about is “poetic techniques” or “poetic elements.” The variations include “literary tech-
niques” or “literary elements.” Whatever the AP writers call them, poetic techniques include
rhyme, rhythm (meter), figurative language, imagery, and the like. (Turn to Chapter 4 for a
complete review of these techniques.) You may see this question in the following forms:
 “Analyze [or consider or discuss] techniques the poet uses in relation to . . .” These
words in the prompt are an open door to how the poem is written. Usually the rest of
the prompt will ask you to relate those techniques to what the poem means or to
something in the poem, such as the speaker’s attitude, the setting, and so on.
 “Consider [or discuss or analyze] the poetic techniques.” In this sort of question, go
for a connection between poetic techniques and meaning or between poetic tech-
niques and the effect on the reader.
In an open question like this, you may forget to look for an important element. So
before you start gathering ideas from the poem, jot down a list of poetic techniques in
the margin. As you read the poem, glance at the list so you don’t skip something useful.
Remember, however, that not every poetic technique is significant or even present in
one particular poem. Don’t be afraid to pick and choose.
 “Consider how [a particular poetic technique] affects . . .” This sort of question spec-
ifies only one particular technique that you’re supposed to discuss (imagery,
metaphor, or syntax, for example). In such a situation, hit that technique and nothing
else. However, don’t ignore the second half of the sentence — what the technique
affects. Be sure to focus on what the exam writers want you to analyze. In that slot, you
may see the following phrases (or any of the other million variations):
• “the reader’s perception of the speaker”
• “the meaning of the poem”
• “the contrast between the past and present”
 “Discuss rhyme, diction, syntax, and the other poetic [or literary] elements found in
the poem.” Certainly you should check for the listed elements, but don’t stop there if
you want your essay to stand out. When faced with this prompt, the vast majority of
test-takers talk about rhyme, diction, and syntax and nothing else. Reading a thousand
essays about the same three poetic elements isn’t the most exciting activity on the
planet. Therefore, if the prompt leaves the door open, for your grader’s sake, venture
into other territory (imagery, line breaks, and so forth). Your grader will be happy.
(Need I explain the advantages of a happy grader?) However, be sure the poetic ele-
ments you discuss are actually significant in the poem that you’re analyzing.
Poetry prompts nearly always require you to write something about how a poem is written.
Look for that idea somewhere in the prompt. As you read the prompt, underline key words
and restate the question in its simplest terms.

91
Chapter 7: Mastering Essay Questions on Poetic Passages
Making Notes and Preparing to Write
After carefully reading the poetry prompt, turn to the poem itself. Zoom through the poem
once without writing anything. The first reading should take no more than a couple of min-
utes, depending on the length of the poem. (Chapter 2 discusses how to budget essay-writing
time.) After you have an overview, reread the poem a bit more slowly, pen in hand. Underline
and annotate anything important. (Chapter 3 explains and gives examples of how to annotate
daily reading assignments for an English course.)
The definition of “anything important” when you’re in the heat of battle with the AP English
Lit exam is different from “anything important” when you’re doing homework. Under test
conditions, you have to concentrate and work as quickly as possible. Follow these steps:
1. Keep the key words of the prompt in your mind and use them to locate relevant
parts of the poem.
Return to those words again and again as you read, focusing your mind on what you’re
searching for. If the prompt asks you to consider diction, underline any words that
seem odd or, conversely, any words that are typical of the particular poem. If the
prompt queries you about imagery, underline all the sensory details.
2. Whenever you have a relevant idea, write a couple of words in the margin.
Allow yourself about 5–7 minutes for this step. Don’t waste time writing the whole idea,
however. Instead, write just enough to help you remember the point you want to make.
Your marginal notes should address both the meaning of the poem and the poetic tech-
niques in it. If the prompt is very general, write all your ideas. If the prompt is more
specific, on the other hand, concentrate only on that aspect of the poem (how the
speaker resolves a conflict, what statement is made about poverty, the relationship
between the speaker and her environment, or any of the gazillion other things prompts
ask about). The prompt may also narrow your focus to one, or perhaps two or three,
particular poetic techniques.
3. Create a thesis statement and subtopics and craft your essay’s introduction.
This step should take no more than 5 minutes. When you’re writing an AP-exam poetry
essay, the thesis statement is generally a restatement of the prompt, with an original
idea (perhaps your understanding of the major theme or meaning of the poem) thrown
in. The subtopics are usually the poetic techniques that you’re writing about or the
content points that you address in your essay. The thesis and subtopics then serve as
the introduction for your essay. Generally one or two sentences do the job, because
you need to get right to the point. Be specific so the reader knows right away what the
essay is about.
In your essay introduction, you must include the title of the poem (enclosed in quota-
tion marks) and the author’s name, if that information appears on the exam. Here are
two examples:
• Prompt: Carefully read the following poem, “The Thought Fox,” by Ted Hughes. In
a well-written essay, discuss how the speaker’s attitude toward art is revealed
through the poetic techniques in the poem.
Introduction: In Ted Hughes’ poem, “The Thought Fox,” the speaker’s attitude
toward art is revealed by diction, imagery, and figurative language. As the
speaker imagines the animal, he creates both the fox and the poem.
• Prompt: Read this poem and analyze how the poetic techniques unify the poem.
Introduction: This sonnet has only one simple message that is reinforced by the
poetic techniques that the author employs. The speaker “count[s] the ways” she
loves. The rhyme scheme, meter, form, and figurative language unify the poem.

92
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
In the preceding examples, both introductions include a reworded version of the
prompt and one extra, original idea (the creation of the fox and the poem and the
single message of love). These introductions get the job done without wasting time.
4. Put the ideas in order.
Decide what topics you want to touch on and in what order. To help yourself organize
your thoughts, go back and put a number on each underlined section of the poem 
(1 for something pertaining to the first subtopic, 2 for anything to do with the second
subtopic, and so on down the line). Do the same thing for your marginal notes. Several
items will have the same number; include all those ideas in the same paragraph of the
essay.
5. Choose quotations that support your main ideas.
When you select a quotation for your essay, take care not to write too many or too few
words. Find the key phrase and leave out the rest.
Here’s what I mean, with a couple of examples in Goldilocks format:
• Example #1:
A Moment — We uncertain step
For newness of the night —
Poor response, too much excerpted: In this poem the images of “A Moment — We
uncertain step / For newness of the night —” lead the reader to think of children. In
this sentence, “A Moment” and “of the night” don’t relate to the point at hand, so
you shouldn’t include them.
Poor response, too little excerpted: In this poem “step” and “newness” lead the
reader to think of children. In this sentence, “step” proves nothing. The important
part is how the subject steps. The link to children is embodied in “uncertain step” —
the way a toddler walks.
Good response: In this poem the images of “uncertain step” and “newness” lead the
reader to think of children. This response is strong because the writer is simply
tying imagery to the idea of youth.
• Example #2:
Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadful, for thou are not so;
For those whom thou think’st thou dost overthrow
Die not, poor Death, nor cans’t thou kill me.
Poor response, too much excerpted: The speaker addresses Death directly, in a
way that diminishes Death’s power, saying, “Death be not proud, though some have
called thee / Mighty and dreadful, for thou are not so; / For those whom thou think’st
thou dost overthrow / Die not, poor Death, nor cans’t thou kill me.” This response
contains every word from four lines, which is way more than necessary.
Poor response, too little excerpted: The speaker diminishes the power of Death,
saying that death shouldn’t be “proud” and “cans’t thou kill me.” This response
leaves out so much that the last point (“cans’t thou kill me”) actually says the
opposite of the point that the writer is trying to make.
Good response: The speaker diminishes the power of Death by addressing “poor
Death” and commanding, “Death, be not proud.” Death is not “Mighty and dreadful”
as people think and does not actually “overthrow” anyone, nor, as the speaker says,
“cans’t thou kill me.” Although the quotations in the preceding responses serve
the same purpose as this one — to show that the speaker thinks Death is vastly
overrated — this response is strong because it adequately supports the point
without dribbling on and on.

Chapter 7: Mastering Essay Questions on Poetic Passages
I want to let you in on a secret of the AP English Lit exam: Most graders spend only two or
three minutes per essay. They read with a mental notepad, on which they place a check
every time you make a point. Here’s what might go through a grader’s mind as she reads: “He
talked about the house image — check. He included a sentence about the window’s symbolic
importance — check. He mentioned a point about the open window — check.” A test-taker
who makes seven points about a poem isn’t necessarily going to score more points than
someone who makes only two points. However, in a speed-grading situation (which the AP
definitely is), the odds favor those who include more ideas.
After you finish preparing to write (up to ten minutes that’s time very well spent, I might
add), slide the question booklet to one corner of your desk. Take out the answer sheet and
get ready to transfer all your brilliance from green (the question booklet) to pink (the answer
sheet). Remember that the graders won’t see the green booklet. None of your writing counts
until it hits the pink paper.
The Mechanics of Proving Your Case
Imagine, as you write your masterpiece, that the AP-grader is the jury and you’re the prose-
cuting attorney. The jury doesn’t need evidence of a crime (although some essays I’ve read
most definitely could be considered literary felonies). Instead, the exam-grader needs evi-
dence supporting the thesis statement that you set out in the introduction.
The evidence consists of quotations from the poem. And I won’t lie — quotations are easy to
find but difficult to insert correctly. Why? Because poetry is governed by some truly annoy-
ing punctuation rules (and that’s a complaint coming from an English teacher!). In this sec-
tion, I take you through the steps of inserting, punctuating, and citing evidence in a poetry
essay.
Inserting quotations
When you write your essay, you want to slip your quotations into it so smoothly that they
barely make a ripple. If possible, make the quoted words part of your sentence rather than a
clunky addition tacked onto the beginning or the end of your sentence.
Check out these clunky and smooth examples:
 Clunky insertion: The poet gives many descriptions of times when things are unclear.
One example of this kind of description is “those Evenings of the Brain.” On these
“Evenings,” you can’t see anything. “When not a Moon disclose a sign.” This last quotation
shows the night is dark.
How is this response clunky? Let me count the ways. For starters, the second and the
fifth sentences label the evidence (“One example of this kind of description is . . .” and
“This last quotation shows . . .”). If the reader can’t tell that you’ve provided an exam-
ple, the example is poorly chosen. Also, the quotation, “When not a Moon disclose a
sign,” is just sitting there all by itself. The quotation should be embedded in the pre-
ceding sentence instead.
 Smooth insertion: Hers is a description of “those Evenings of the Brain,” which the
reader comes to understand as simply times when something is unclear, or “When not a
Moon disclose a sign.”
You can probably tell that this quotation insertion is nice and smooth just by reading it
aloud. The quotations arise from the sentence. For example, the first is the object of
the preposition “of.” The second quotation restates “when something is unclear.” The
“or” links them without a fuss.

94
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
Because poetry is sometimes difficult to decode, you may be tempted to insert the quotation
and then restate it in your own words because you’re not sure the reader will understand it
without a “translation.” Bad idea! Assume that the reader knows what the words mean
(because the readers usually do). Adding a paraphrase wastes time and slows the flow of
argument.
Punctuating quotations
Poetry essays require some ordinary punctuation marks — quotation marks, for example —
and some that you hardly ever need in real-life writing. The oddballs include slashes,
ellipses, and brackets. In this section, I show you how to punctuate poetry quotations prop-
erly, and I also explain how to block a quotation.
Quotation marks
When you quote from a poem (or from anything else for that matter), place quotation marks
around the words that you’re quoting. If the quotation is followed by a period or a comma,
place the period or comma inside the closing quotation mark, unless you’re citing a line
number. (I explain how to cite quotations later in the chapter.) Here are examples of a line
from a Shakespearean sonnet, properly enclosed in quotation marks:
As Shakespeare writes, “You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes.”
Shakespeare’s line, “You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes,” recognizes the power of
art to confer immortality.
“You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes,” writes Shakespeare.
Notice that the speaker identification (“Shakespeare writes”) is followed by a comma when it
appears at the beginning of the sentence.
Slashes and blocks
Poets spend a lot of time deciding where a line ends, so when you quote more than one line
of poetry, you should indicate line breaks with a slash or with a blocked quotation. The slash
has a little space before and after it, as in this example:
Shakespeare writes, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? / Thou art more lovely
and more temperate.”
Another way to show line breaks is to block, or center, the quotation on separate lines.
Blocks are best if you’re quoting a large chunk of the poem, though strictly speaking, you can
use them for as few as two lines. The lines should be indented about ten spaces from the left
margin. However, remember that when you block a quotation, you don’t use quotation
marks. For example:
Nature appears often in this sonnet:
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.
Ellipses
If you drop any words from a poem, insert an ellipsis (the punctuation mark showing three
little dots) to show the reader that something’s missing. (Be very careful, however, not to
drop words that are essential to the meaning of a line. Be true to the author’s intentions.) If
the missing words follow a punctuation mark, leave the punctuation mark if it helps the
reader figure out the sense of the line. For instance, you might keep an exclamation point or
a question mark but usually not a comma or a period. You don’t need to place ellipses at the
beginning or the end of a quotation. The reader assumes that words may precede or follow

95
Chapter 7: Mastering Essay Questions on Poetic Passages
the quotation and that the words you’ve chosen don’t constitute the entire poem. Consider
the following lines from John Milton’s “How Soon Hath Time”:
How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stoln on his wing my three and twentieth year!
My hasting days fly on with full career,
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.
Here are some examples, based on the preceding lines, of ellipses in action:
Quoted with words missing from one line: The speaker acknowledges that Time has
“[s]toln . . . my three and twentieth year!” (Note: I explain later in the chapter the
instances when you should write “Stoln” with a lowercase “s” in brackets.)
Quoted with words missing from two lines: The speaker laments, “How soon hath 
Time . . . Stoln on his wing my three and twentieth year!”
Quoted with a complete line missing: The speaker laments,
How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth,
Stoln on his wing my three and twentieth year!
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
But my late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.
A better way to handle a long quotation with an entire line missing is to take small sections
of the quotation and insert them into your own sentence, paraphrasing where necessary. For
example, the preceding sample may be presented this way: The speaker calls time “the subtle
thief of youth,” and laments that his “late spring no bud or blossom shew’th.”
Brackets
Most of the time you chop words from a quotation, but occasionally you have to add or
change something for the sake of clarity or to avoid breaking the usual capitalization rules.
(However, if the poet is playing with the capitalization rules to make a point, don’t change
anything.) You can avoid these confusing situations by using brackets (the things that look
like squared-off parentheses). Brackets tell the reader that the quotation no longer appears
as the writer intended. Check out these examples of brackets in action, based on the Milton
lines in the preceding section on ellipses:
Referring to the loss of his youth, the speaker says, it that was “[s]toln on his wing.”
The speaker regrets that his twenty-third year was taken “on [Time’s] wing.”
In the first example, the capital “S” changes to a lowercase “s” because the word appears in
the middle of a sentence. In the second example, “his” has been changed to “Time’s” because
“his” is too vague.
Citing quotations
Citing sources is usually the bane of a student’s existence. So before you run screaming from
the room, let me explain that on the AP English exam citations aren’t as big of a deal as they
are in a research paper. (After all, with research papers, you have to indicate the source in a
bibliography or source list and follow about a thousand rules for footnotes or parenthetical
citations. Talk about instant headache material.) The English prof who slaps a grade on your
work knows the source because the poem is right there on the exam. The only things you
need to cite in an AP poetry essay are the line numbers. And of course, if you know the title
and author of the poem, that information belongs in the introduction.

96
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
You aren’t actually required to cite line numbers on the AP English exam. The graders have
read the poem, and they know where everything is. However, I was once sitting in a room full
of AP English teachers for a practice grading session (which was just slightly less enjoyable
than a visit to my dentist). One of the four essays we read, graded, and discussed included
line-number citations, and the other three didn’t. Not only did the essay with citations score
better than the other three, but nearly every teacher mentioned the fact that citations were
included. What can I say? English teachers are suckers for stuff like that.
To insert a line-number citation, use parentheses, and don’t worry about writing anything
but the line number (the word “line” is unnecessary). The citation isn’t part of the quotation,
so it should follow the closing quotation mark. It precedes the period or comma or whatever
punctuation mark that the sentence requires, as you see here:
As Shakespeare writes, “You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes” (14).
Shakespeare’s line, “You live in this, and dwell in lovers’ eyes” (14), recognizes the
power of art to confer immortality.
Shakespeare writes, “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day? / Thou art more lovely
and more temperate” (1–2).
In a blocked quotation, place the citation after the last word:
Nature appears often in this sonnet:
Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate. (1–2)
Knowing how to cite is important whether for an AP English Lit class or for any other class
requiring research and writing. I cover citations in detail in Webster’s New World Punctuation:
Simplified and Applied (Wiley, 2006).
Adding Your Commentary: Analysis 
without the Couch
Believe it or not, analysis in a poetry essay actually has a lot to do with the kind of analysis
associated with Sigmund Freud, who’s the boss when it comes to psychology. Freud listened
to what his patients said, and then he interpreted the hidden meanings. You do the same
thing when you write a poetry essay, except that you’re “listening” to the poem and interpret-
ing the words in the context of the prompt.
All the skills I review in Chapters 4 and 5 — decoding the literal level and unearthing deeper
meanings — make up the “toolkit” for poetry analysis. I can’t cover every situation, because
prompts vary. However, these guidelines will help you analyze an AP poetry selection:
 If the prompt queries you about content, figure out what the poem means and deter-
mine your answer. For example, suppose the prompt asks you about the speaker’s 
attitude toward rural life. Well, what is the speaker’s attitude toward rural life? Does
she love it, hate it, or sit on the fence? Extract details from the poem that prove your
point. Don’t just list the details, however. Look for connotation, associations, allusions,
and so forth. State what you find.
 If the prompt focuses on specific poetic devices, start by listing all you find in the
poem. For instance, if the prompt queries you about the effect of figurative language,
begin by locating these metaphors, similes, personification, and similar devices. Then
ask yourself how the poem would be different if, for example, autumn were not personi-
fied. Now you know what the personification does to and for the reader. Declare that
fact in your essay. Bingo! You’ve got an analytical statement.

97
Chapter 7: Mastering Essay Questions on Poetic Passages
 If the prompt requires you to link technique and meaning, as most prompts do, deter-
mine the meaning and then look for poetic elements such as rhythm (meter), rhyme,
figurative language, imagery, diction, tone, and so on. Make as many statements as pos-
sible tying a particular poetic device to the ideas in the poem.
The most important word in analysis is why. Ask yourself why a particular word appears
where it does, or why the speaker describes herself in a certain way. The answer to the ques-
tion why is your analysis.
The following examples illustrate good and bad analytical technique. In the good ones, the
writers examine the words and put them under a microscope to make a point. Yup — Freud
would have been proud!
Bad analysis: The poem has assonance in line 14. The words “live,” “in,” and “this” all
have short “i” vowel sounds.
Why it’s bad: The writer has simply listed examples of assonance without explaining
why anyone should care that these words share a vowel sound.
Good analysis: The short vowel sound of the letter “i” in line 14 (“You live in this, and
dwell in lovers’ eyes”) links three words: “live,” “this,” and “in.” The pronoun “this” refers
to the poem. The repeated vowel sounds emphasize that the lover lives in the poem.
Why it’s good: Now the assonance means something: a link between three words that
serve to declare the main idea of the poem.
Bad analysis: The speaker uses a metaphor of “my late spring.” The metaphor shows
that the speaker is getting old.
Why it’s bad: Yes, the metaphor does express the concept of aging. But why use a
metaphor? Why not simply say, “I’m getting old”? The essay writer hasn’t delved into
the metaphor.
Good analysis: The speaker’s metaphor, “my late spring” (4), expresses his frustration.
Spring is a time of new life; nature comes into bloom in that season. However, the
speaker says that “no bud or blossom shew’th” (4). He’s barren, lacking even a little sign
of productivity. However, there is hope because his spring is “late” (4). Perhaps the
flower of creativity will come eventually.
Why it’s good: Now the metaphor makes sense. The analysis brings in the idea of
nature, seasons, barrenness, and lack of productivity. The speaker has gone way beyond
saying that the speaker is getting old.
Wrapping Up with a Quick Conclusion
You have no time for a long, drawn-out conclusion when you’re writing an AP essay. All you
can do is hit one idea hard, perhaps in just one sentence. Take care not to repeat yourself
and summarize your thoughts. Essay graders don’t consider summaries proper conclusions.
Instead, simply extend what you’ve already said.
Here are two conclusion samples, including some information about the essay so you can put
them into context:
Essay content: Discussion of how the imagery in Nicholas Christopher’s poem “The
Palm Reader” reveals the author’s attitude toward the title character, who lives in a 
cluttered room with a family that is alienated from her. The Palm Reader is a pathetic
character.
Conclusion: The future is called “inescapable” and it “jumps out / at her from every
stranger’s hand.” The Palm Reader may or may not be able to tell the future, but she
must live it.

98
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
Essay content: Analysis of the poetic techniques that are used to characterize the
speaker in Dylan Thomas’s “Fern Hill.” The speaker is an older person looking back at a
seemingly idyllic boyhood that was lost as he aged.
Conclusion: The speaker concludes by stating, “I sang in my chains like the sea.” The
“sea” is natural, as is the speaker’s loss of innocence and youth.
Notice that each conclusion adds just one tiny idea. Both of these examples refer to the end
of the poem, which is a good spot to find a conclusion. After all, that’s where the poet con-
cluded! (I explain more about conclusions in Chapter 3.)
Aiming Your Ballpoint at the Goal: 
A Sample Poetry Essay
Your aim is always better when you can see the target, so here I provide a glimpse of the
bull’s-eye. I include Wilfred Owen’s poem “Arms and the Boy,” a sample prompt, a reasonably
good essay, and commentary on the essay’s merits and faults. (You can write your own prac-
tice essays with the prompts in Chapter 8.)
Sample poem and prompt: Wilfred Owen’s 
“Arms and the Boy”
Carefully read the following poem “Arms and the Boy” by Wilfred Owen. In a well-written
essay, discuss how the poetic techniques convey the poet’s view of warfare.
Let the boy try along this bayonet-blade
How cold steel is, and keen with hunger of blood;
Blue with all malice, like a madman’s flash;
And thinly drawn with famishing for flesh.
Lend him to stroke these blind, blunt bullet-heads
Which long to muzzle in the hearts of lads.
Or give him cartridges of fine zinc teeth,
Sharp with the sharpness of grief and death.
For his teeth seem for laughing round an apple.
There lurk no claws behind his fingers supple;
And God will grow no talons at his heels,
Nor antlers through the thickness of his curls.

Chapter 7: Mastering Essay Questions on Poetic Passages
In Wilfred Owen’s “Arms and the Boy,” the poet’s view of war is at first hidden from the
reader. The boy of the title is introduced to weapons, presumably to become a good sol-
dier. However, as the poem goes on, the weapons are associated with grief and destruc-
tion. Owen ultimately concludes that war is not natural and that young men must be
brought to it against their nature. Owen’s viewpoint towards war is conveyed through
imagery, figurative language, syntax, and diction.
The first and second stanzas include several images of armaments: “bayonet-blade” (1),
“cold steel” (2), “blunt bullet-heads” (5), and “cartridges of fine zinc teeth” (7). The
reader sees the tools of war, the “arms” of the title. Owen begins these two stanzas with
commands: “Let the boy try” (1) and “Lend him” (5). Because of these commands, the
reader is led to believe that the poet wants the boy to become accustomed to war and
armaments. However, the diction implies the opposite. The steel is “cold” (2), without
human feelings. The blade is “keen” (2), which means “sharp,” literally. However, “keen”
may also mean “eager,” and the blade is “keen with hunger of blood” (2). In other words,
the blade is bloodthirsty. The bayonet is described with a simile, “like a madman’s flash”
(3) and is personified by “famishing for flesh” (4). The bullets are “blind” and “blunt” (5),
so they do not see the damage they do. The dark side of war comes through.
At the end of stanza two, the poet’s condemnation of war emerges clearly. The “fine zinc
teeth” (7) have “the sharpness of grief and death” (8). Now the reader sees the conse-
quences of these arms; they do harm. The third stanza begins with an innocent nature
image of teeth “laughing round an apple” (9). The boy’s natural innocence is emphasized
by the fact that his fingers are “supple” (10) and have “no claws” (10). The verb “lurk”
(10) is associated with claws and implies the secret behavior of a hunter or a criminal.
The boy is the opposite. He is meant to laugh: “For his teeth seem for laughing round an
apple” (9). Owen brings God into the poem in favor of innocence. God “will grow no
talons” (11) or “antlers” (12). These are an animal’s weapons, and the implication is
clear. Animals hunt and kill and maim by instinct. Human beings, specifically the boy in
this poem, must be taught to “try . . . this bayonet-blade” (1) and learn “to stroke these
blind, blunt bullet-heads” (5).
The poet’s tone is ironic. Young men will go to war, but they will not mature there.
Instead, they will betray both God’s plan and their own nature. They will be changed by
the “arms” they are given.
Evaluation of the sample essay
This essay isn’t perfect, but for a 40-minute effort, it’s very good indeed. Here’s an analysis of
its virtues and flaws. Overall, this writer did a fine job. If I were grading this essay, I’d award it
an 8 out of a possible 9 points.
Here are the good points of the essay:
 The main ideas are all there. The prompt asks about Owen’s attitude toward war, and
the essay states what that attitude is (that war is an unnatural act that’s harmful to
young men). The prompt also requires a discussion of literary techniques, and the
writer mentions diction, tone, syntax, imagery, and figurative language.
 The essay has a fairly sturdy structure. The writer includes an introduction with all the
necessary elements, body paragraphs with evidence and line numbers, and a strong
conclusion.
 Some of the analysis is fairly sophisticated. The word “keen,” for instance, is discussed
on the literal and figurative level.
 The essay is filled with good quotations from the poem, so every point is well 
supported by evidence.

100
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
 The writing is fluid. In other words, when you read it aloud, it flows. The quotations are
tucked smoothly into the text.
 The essay has good mechanics. The spelling, grammar, and punctuation are all on
target.
Here are the points of the essay that could use improvement:
 The body paragraphs are a little disorganized. The writer could have placed all the
points about diction in one paragraph, everything about imagery in another, and so
forth. Alternatively, the writer could have used the poem itself as an organizer, saying
everything about the first stanza in the first body paragraph, everything about the
second stanza in the second body paragraph, and everything about the third stanza in
the last body paragraph.
 Here and there the writer repeats himself or herself or elaborates unnecessarily. For
instance, the last sentence of the second paragraph isn’t necessary. I’d also drop “In
other words, the blade is bloodthirsty” from the second paragraph.

ot quite ready for opening night on Broadway — er, I mean, the AP English Literature
and Composition exam? Consider this chapter a dress rehearsal for the poetry act.
First up is everyone’s favorite: multiple-choice questions. Next are the essay prompts. (Go
ahead, throw tomatoes.) Both are accompanied by answers and explanations, so you’ll be
ready to face the AP exam graders. Sharpen your pencil and take out some lined paper. It’s
almost show time.
Selecting an Answer from Multiple Options
If a mere glance at a multiple-choice poetry question makes you break out in hives, you’re in
the right spot. Also, you have a lot of company. Multiple-choice poetry questions are some-
times difficult, but with practice, you can face them with confidence. And that’s what this
section provides: four practice poems of varying styles and accompanying questions. (I tell
you the title, author, and date of each poem to follow the publisher’s citation style, but the
real AP exam may not provide that information.) Take advantage of the wide margins in this
chapter to annotate the questions and the poems. After you have an answer, write it on a
sheet of lined paper.
I provide the answer and explanation for each question immediately after the multiple-choice
options so you can have immediate feedback. When you’ve done the practice questions,
study your mistakes and review as needed in Chapter 4 (poetry basics) or Chapter 5 (strat-
egy for the test itself). If you’re an early bird and the test is a couple of months away, you can
address any areas of weakness with help from Chapter 3. For example, if you trip over vocab-
ulary questions, Chapter 3 explains how to beef up your stock of words.
Practice set 1
Read the following poem, “Renters,” by John Allman, and then answer the questions that
follow. The poem is reprinted from Lowcountry (New Directions, 2007).

The egret’s1 platform of sticks no more permanent
than my furnished room on West 58th Street —
that shared toilet a marsh creek or slough2
rich in mice. Think how all the wading birds
like to breed near each other, regurgitating night
and day into the maws3 of their young. Think of
the apartments we inhabited on busy avenues,
the honking of cars trapped by double parkers,
the attic rooms with low dormers we hit our heads on,
the ghastly abstract mural a tenant painted on the green wall,
its pretension of vitality and swirl and soft mire
where the bittern4 coughs. Think how the ring-billed
gull5 returns north, replenishing itself on farmers’ pests,
how we abandoned the Bronx to arrive on a snow-filled
midnight in Syracuse, our goods on the sidewalk like twigs
for the picking.
1. Long-necked bird.
2. A marsh or swamp.
3. Animal’s mouth.
4. Marsh bird.
5. Type of seagull.
1. The phrase “no more permanent” (line 1) compares
(A) sticks and houses
(B) birds and people
(C) the speaker and a bird
(D) a bird’s nest and the speaker
(E) a bird’s nest and the speaker’s rented room
The first two lines begin a lengthy comparison between the many rooms or apartments the
speaker has inhabited and the “platform of sticks” that serves as a temporary home for the
egret. Therefore, choice (E) is the correct answer.
2. Lines 3 and 4 imply that the “shared toilet” was
(A) infested with mice
(B) located near a marsh
(C) used by both the speaker and the birds
(D) wet
(E) dirty
Lines 3 and 4 continue to compare the marsh birds’ nests to the speaker’s living conditions, a
“furnished room on West 58th Street” (line 2) — which, by the way, probably rents for several
thousand dollars a minute in today’s overheated Manhattan real estate market. But I digress.
As the “shared toilet” (line 3) is in Manhattan, not in a marshy area, (B) and (C) aren’t the
answers you want. The birds’ toilet is probably wet and dirty — (D) and (E) — but you can’t
tell from the poem whether the speaker’s toilet was in a similar state. All you know for sure is
that it was “rich in mice,” making (A) the answer you seek.
102
Part II: Poetry in Motion 
(01)

(10)
(15)

3. According to the poem, all of the following characteristics apply to both marsh birds and the
speaker EXCEPT
(A) living in close quarters
(B) transience
(C) a need to create a home
(D) resistance to change
(E) the ability to live in difficult conditions
The birds “like to breed near each other” (line 5) and the people live on “busy avenues” 
(line 7), so (A) is out. The egret’s nest is “no more permanent” than the speaker’s “furnished
room” (line 2), so (B) bites the dust. Choice (C) doesn’t make the grade because the birds are
creating homes (“platform of sticks” in line 1) and so are people. Choice (E) appears in the
poem in the “mire” (line 11) the birds live in and the many details of apartment life, including
“low dormers we hit our heads on” (line 9) and the shared toilet (line 3). You’re left with (D),
a good choice because the birds move north (line 13) and so does the speaker (lines 14–15).
4. The predominant literary technique in lines 7–10 is
(A) figurative language
(B) imagery
(C) narrative
(D) monologue
(E) alliteration
Imagery is lit-speak for description that appeals to the five senses (taste, touch, sight, hear-
ing, and smell). Lines 7–10 cover most of those: “honking” (line 8) assaults the ear, the
“ghastly abstract mural” (line 10) assaults the eye, and whacking one’s head on the dormer
(line 9) certainly relates to touch. The correct answer is (B). The other answers don’t appear
in lines 7–10. Figurative language includes metaphors, similes, personification, and the like. 
A narrative is a story. A monologue is one person speaking, but this term refers to a dramatic,
“I-hear-your-voice” speech, not the plain comments of the speaker in this poem. Alliteration
refers to sound, specifically the repetition of consonants, which occurs but doesn’t dominate
these lines.
5. The repetition of “Think” (lines 4, 6, and 12)
(A) emphasizes the importance of an analytical approach to nature
(B) reminds the speaker of the past
(C) shows the reader how nature and human behavior are related
(D) commands the speaker to pay attention to the similarities between human and avian
behavior
(E) reveals the speaker’s desperation
The devilish part of this question is that many of the answers are true of the poem in general:
the speaker is analyzing nature (A) and thinking of the past (B). Choice (E) is the only answer
residing on Planet Wrong. Now you’re left with (C) and (D). Both deal with the relationship
between nature and human behavior. The key here, then, is to consider which answer relates
to the word “Think.” Each time the word appears, it’s a command the speaker gives. The first
time you see the word (line 4) it begins a statement about birds. The second time (line 6) it
introduces a description of the speaker’s living conditions. The last time the word is men-
tioned (line 12), it begins a sentence that includes both birds and people. (D) is best because
it indicates the command, rather than the more general “show” of choice (C).

6. The primary purpose of line 11 is to
(A) link the birds’ habitat to the speaker’s
(B) emphasize the speaker’s dislike of the mural
(C) disconnect the speaker from nature
(D) reveal the artist’s lack of talent
(E) show how nature and art are related
Line 11 contains three descriptions, “pretension of vitality,” “swirl,” and “mire.” Line 10
describes the speaker’s living conditions, and line 12 states, “where the bittern coughs.”
Therefore, line 11 is a link between the two, making (A) the best choice.
7. The “farmers’ pests” (line 13) are analogous to
(A) “platform of sticks” (line 1)
(B) “that shared toilet” (line 3)
(C) “regurgitating night” (line 5)
(D) the mural (line 10)
(E) “our goods on the sidewalk” (line 15)
Pests aren’t valued and the “goods on the sidewalk” (line 15) are there “for the picking” 
(line 16), like garbage. Both are unwanted in some sense, but are valuable in another sense.
The pest that the farmer wants to get rid of feeds the birds. And the goods that appear to be
throwaways are the speaker’s possessions. Therefore choice (E) is the answer that you’re
looking for.
8. The phrase “rich in mice” (line 4)
(A) creates a distinction between the birds and the speaker
(B) is an oxymoron
(C) reveals the poet’s cynicism
(D) emphasizes the bounty of nature
(E) is sarcastic
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as the saying goes, and so is the desirability of mice. You
don’t want them in your home, I imagine, unless you have a great love for little furry crea-
tures. (If so, good for you. But I like mice in the field, not in the kitchen.) For the birds in the
poem, however, a mouse might be dinner. Choice (A) expresses this distinction between
human and avian life. An oxymoron, by the way, is not that meathead who failed math 12
times. It’s an expression that seems to contradict itself, such as “jumbo shrimp.”
9. The tone of this poem may be described as
(A) argumentative
(B) reflective
(C) ironic
(D) nostalgic
(E) forceful
You can rule out (A) and (E) because the speaker isn’t arguing about which is better, birds or
people; nor is the speaker stating the opposite of what he or she means, placing the state-
ment in ironic territory. You can therefore drop (C). That leaves you with reflective or nostal-
gic. Nostalgia has a bit of sweetness in it, and this poem doesn’t. Go for the more neutral
choice, (B).
104
Part II: Poetry in Motion 

10. The title of this poem is significant because it
I.
expresses the transience of the birds’ and the speaker’s homes
II.
reveals the poverty renters face
III. conveys a sense of powerlessness
(A) I only
(B) I and II
(C) II and III
(D) none of the above
(E) all of the above
A renter may move at any time, and in this poem both the birds and the speaker move north.
The speaker also moves at other times, as the poem refers to “apartments” (line 7). The
second statement is only partly true; the speaker doesn’t live in luxury, but some renters do.
A renter is subject to a landlord, but “powerlessness” is too extreme. Go for (A), because
only the first statement is justified.
Practice set 2
Carefully read the following poem, “Inland” by Edna St. Vincent Millay, and answer the 
questions that follow.
People that build their houses inland,
People that buy a plot of ground
Shaped like a house, and build a house there,
Far from the sea-board, far from the sound
Of water sucking the hollow ledges,
Tons of water striking the shore, —
What do they long for, as I long for
One salt smell of the sea once more?
People the waves have not awakened,
Spanking the boats at the harbor’s head,
What do they long for, as I long for, —
Starting up in my inland bed,
Beating the narrow walls, and finding
Neither a window nor a door,
Screaming to God for death by drowning, —
One salt taste of the sea once more?
11. In the context of this poem, “plot” (line 2)
(A) indicates that the speaker is scheming to return to the sea.
(B) compares an area of land to a cemetery plot.
(C) shows the narrowness of inland lives.
(D) conveys stability.
(E) reveals the uniformity of people’s lives.
Literally the “plot” (line 2) is a parcel of land on which houses are built. However, the same
word is used for a cemetery plot, the sliver of land that’s your last address. Both meanings
apply in this poem because the first stanza talks about “houses” and the last stanza refers to
“[n]either a window nor a door” (line 14) and “death by drowning” (line 15). Choice (B) is
therefore the best answer.

12. The poem compares
I.
life on the sea and life on land
II.
a sailor’s life before and after the sailor’s return to land
III. death by drowning to death on land
(A) all of the above
(B) none of the above
(C) I and II
(D) II and III
(E) I and III
The speaker wonders about “People that build their houses inland” (line 1) and speaks of 
his or her own feelings about the sea: “as I long for / One salt smell of the sea once more?”
(lines 7–8). Therefore, the first statement is valid. The speaker also talks about “[s]tarting up
in my inland bed” (line 12), longing for the sea. Bingo: Statement II makes the cut. The third is
tempting, because the poem mentions “death by drowning” (line 15). However, nothing in the
poem speaks of death on land. The third statement drops out, and you’re left with choice (C).
13. The lack of punctuation at the end of line 4
(A) creates an incomplete sentence.
(B) makes the first stanza more important.
(C) weakens the beginning of the second stanza.
(D) cuts the first stanza off from the second stanza.
(E) allows “sound” to refer to an auditory sensation and to a body of water.
A line ending with no punctuation (which is called enjambment in literary terminology), both
cuts and joins. The line break says stop, but the sentence continues. Poets get two meanings
from this sort of trick. On the one hand, if you stop at the end of line 4, it reads “Far from the
sea-board, far from the sound,” with “sound” being a body of water. If you keep going, how-
ever, you have “far from the sound / Of water” (lines 4–5). Now “sound” means noise. As you
see, choice (E) works nicely.
14. All of the following are found in the first stanza (lines 1–4) EXCEPT
(A) parallel structure
(B) enjambment
(C) rhyme
(D) metaphor
(E) simile
Parallels in poetry are patterns that repeat. You can cross off choice (A) because the first
stanza has two parallels (“People that . . .” and “Far from . . .”). You can also dump (B)
because you see enjambment in lines 2 and 4. Rhyme occurs in lines 2 and 4, and a simile
shows up in line 3 (“Shaped like a house”). Okay, you’re left with (D), an implied comparison,
which isn’t in this poem.
15. Line 9 may be interpreted to mean that
(A) some people are heavy sleepers.
(B) anyone who lives inland hasn’t truly lived.
(C) inland life is less peaceful than life on the sea.
(D) it is better not to experience life on the sea.
(E) inland life is preferable to life on the sea.
106
Part II: Poetry in Motion 

Throughout the poem the speaker wonders what inland life is like. However, the speaker isn’t
neutral. By the fourth stanza the speaker is “[s]creaming to God” (line 15) for a “salt taste of
the sea once more” (line 16). Keep that stanza in mind as you look back at “awakened” (line
9). The word has a double meaning — roused from sleep and opened to the fullness of life.
Choice (B) fits both of these definitions.
16. Line 11 marks a shift between
(A) formal and informal diction
(B) a regular and an irregular rhyme scheme
(C) analysis and opinion
(D) relative detachment and increased emotion
(E) vehemence and detachment
In the first ten lines of the poem, the speaker wonders about life inland but gives only one
emotional clue: “as I long for / One salt smell of the sea once more” (lines 7–8). From line 11
onward, however, the emotion builds. The speaker would rather drown than die inland. The
speaker is “beating” (line 13) and “screaming” (line 15). The other choices fall apart for vari-
ous reasons. Choice (A) is out because the diction, or word choice, doesn’t change. Nor does
the rhyme scheme. The first ten lines speculate about those who live “inland”; no analysis
appears, so (C) isn’t a good answer. Choice (E) would be fine if it were reversed, with the
detachment moving to vehemence — the pattern described by the correct answer, (D).
17. The “inland bed” (line 12) may be
(A) a narrow cot
(B) a grave
(C) a sleeping bag
(D) a jail cell
(E) a shared accommodation
This poem is full of double meanings. If the speaker is “inland” (the title of the poem), he or
she may actually be “in the land” as in “in the earth” or in a grave. That meaning fits the
“narrow walls” (line 13) without windows and doors (line 14) and the reference to death in
line 15. Now you’ve arrived at (B) as the best answer.
18. The speaker is probably
(A) a former sailor
(B) someone who has always longed to go to sea
(C) someone who has always lived inland
(D) a homeowner
(E) on a ship
The speaker is longing to go to sea “once more” (lines 8 and 16), so choices (C) and (E) are
easy to eliminate. You know the speaker wants to go to the sea now, but you don’t know if
that same wish was always present; drop (B). The speaker muses about people “that buy a
plot of ground” (line 2), but you can’t tell whether the speaker is in that category, and some
lines suggest otherwise. All you can be sure of is (A), someone who once sailed and would
like to do so again.
107
Chapter 8: Flexing Your Poetry Muscles: Practice Questions

19. The dominant technique in the second stanza (lines 5–8) is
(A) internal monologue
(B) dialogue
(C) narration
(D) figurative language
(E) imagery
The second stanza is all sensory description — the “water sucking the hollow ledges” (line
5), the “tons of water striking the shore” (line 6), and the “salt smell” (line 8). As you may
know, imagery is defined as sensory description, so choice (E) is the one you’re looking for.
20. In the context of line 12, “starting” may be defined as
(A) beginning
(B) opening
(C) sudden awakening
(D) originating
(E) establishing
The speaker is “starting up” in an “inland bed” (line 12). What do you do in a bed? You wake
up! The other choices all address the “moving to something new” definition of “starting.”
Because the speaker is in a bed, the only definition that fits is (C).
Practice set 3
Read the following poem, “The World Is Too Much with Us” by William Wordsworth, and
answer the questions that follow.
The world is too much with us; late and soon,
Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers:
Little we see in nature that is ours;
We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!
This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;
The Winds that will be howling at all hours
And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;
For this, for every thing, we are out of tune;
It moves us not — Great God! I’d rather be
A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;
So might I, standing on this pleasant lea1,
Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;
Have sight of Proteus2 coming from the sea;
Or hear old Triton3 blow his wreathèd horn.
1. Meadow.
2. In Greek mythology, the “Old Man of the Sea.”
3. In Greek mythology, a sea god.

21. The tone of this poem may be described as
(A) passionate
(B) humorous
(C) detached
(D) sarcastic
(E) ironic
Tone describes the attitude of the author, and (A) is a perfect fit. Wordsworth doesn’t hold
back here. He’s got a cause (people have lost touch with nature because they’re too busy
using it to make money), and he’s screaming at the reader. Just look at the punctuation —
two exclamation points in 14 lines. He’s angry, not funny or calm, so you can drop (B) and
(C). He’s also straightforward, telling it like it is. Clearly, choices (D) and (E) don’t do the job
either.
22. Which statement best expresses the meaning of lines 1 and 2?
(A) It is too late to change the way we relate to commerce.
(B) We have ruined the natural world by our industry.
(C) We waste time and energy making and spending money.
(D) It is never too late to think about the world’s welfare.
(E) We do not take advantage of the power we have to change the world.
This question is straight reading comprehension. These lines are easier to decode if you
change the sentence pattern into one resembling normal speech. The key words, for
instance, are at the end of line 2: “We lay waste our powers.” If you move “getting and spend-
ing,” you have “We lay waste our powers getting and spending.” The expression “lay waste”
(line 2) means spoil or ruin, but you can still arrive at the correct answer is you go for the
simpler meaning, “waste.” From there it’s a short hop to choice (C). Line 1 reinforces the
meaning: “The world is too much with us” may be interpreted as “We think too much about
worldly things, as opposed to spiritual or natural things.” The punctuation of line 2 also
helps you arrive at the correct answer. Line 2 ends with a colon, so the next statement must
be either a list or an explanation of the preceding statement. Here, in line 3, you have an
explanation, and that explanation is a statement that supports choice (C).
23. The shift in line 9 may be characterized as
(A) idealistic to realistic
(B) literal to figurative
(C) descriptive to interpretive
(D) scientific to artistic
(E) universal to personal
The first eight lines employ first person plural (the we/our/us form), but halfway through line
9 the first person singular (the I/my/me form) appears. Clearly (E) is the best choice. The
other answers don’t come close. Choice (A) is out because the whole poem is idealistic, and
(B) bombs because figurative language appears throughout the poem. (Figurative language is
the literary term for similes, metaphors, personification, and other imaginative expressions.)
The poem is neither descriptive nor scientific, so you’re left with (E).
109
Chapter 8: Flexing Your Poetry Muscles: Practice Questions

24. In the context of the poem, “creed outworn” (line 10) may be defined as
(A) beliefs shown openly
(B) prayers in archaic language
(C) beliefs that have outlived their usefulness
(D) religion no longer practiced
(E) religion that is practiced publicly
The speaker in the poem wishes to return to an earlier time, when the connection with
nature, expressed in mythology, was closer and more personal. The tricky part of this answer
set is that some of the answers fit the meaning of “creed” (a statement or prayer of belief),
and some attempt to trap you into thinking that “outworn” means “public,” or “worn on the
outside.” In fact, “outworn” means “worn out.” Choice (B) is tempting because an archaic lan-
guage is one that is no longer spoken, but “prayers” and “creed” aren’t exactly the same.
Choice (C) doesn’t work because the speaker thinks that such a creed would be useful.
You’re left with (D), the correct answer.
25. The allusions to Greek mythology in lines 13 and 14
(A) emphasize the close connection of the speaker with the natural world
(B) idealize the past
(C) show how much progress has been made in the modern world
(D) express the speaker’s religious views
(E) dismiss the speaker’s views as fantasy
The speaker sees the past, represented by a “creed outworn” (line 10) as well as by the allu-
sions to ancient Greek mythology as a better, purer time when the world wasn’t “too much
with us” (line 1). Just a quick glimpse of the old gods would make the speaker “less forlorn”
(line 12). Choice (B) is the answer that you’re looking for.
26. The dominant literary technique in lines 5–8 is
(A) repetition of syntactic patterns
(B) internal rhyme
(C) figurative language
(D) irregular meter
(E) unusual word choice
Figurative language is all over lines 5–8, so (C) is the correct answer. The sea and the winds
are personified (the sea bares her bosom, and the winds howl). The winds are also “up-gath-
ered now like sleeping flowers” (line 7), a simile. In line 8, we’re “out of tune,” an implicit
comparison between human beings and musical instruments. Figurative language rules! The
only other answer that comes close is (E), because “up-gathered” seldom appears in every-
day conversation. Neither does “bosom,” unless you’re reading a lingerie catalogue. No
matter how you calculate, however, figurative language dominates.
110
Part II: Poetry in Motion 

27. The speaker would “rather be / A Pagan” (lines 9–10) because he or she would then
(A) value “getting and spending” (line 2) more.
(B) relate better to modern business.
(C) consider religion more important.
(D) be connected spiritually to nature.
(E) have more control over nature.
The first part of the poem, which by the way is a sonnet, describes the disconnect between
nature and human beings. The last bit (from “Great God!” to the end) shows what was lost
according to the speaker — an intimate, spiritual connection to nature. Without a doubt,
choice (D) is the best answer.
28. Which two lines are the closest in meaning?
(A) 3 and 4
(B) 3 and 8
(C) 11 and 12
(D) 11 and 13
(E) 13 and 14
According to line 3, we see little in nature “that is ours,” which is the equivalent of the state-
ment in line 8 that “we are out of tune” with the sea and the winds. Line 4 concerns the waste
of human energy and passion, because “[w]e have given our hearts away.” These two mean-
ings don’t match, so you can rule out (A). Lines 11 and 12 tell a story. In line 11 the speaker is
standing in a meadow, and in line 12 he or she is less sad. Because lines 11 and 12 aren’t the
same, (C) drops out. Line 13 also describes something the speaker sees (at least in his or her
imagination!), so line 13 pairs with 12 (not an answer choice), not with line 11. You can also
rule out 13 and 14, because each tells of a different thing the speaker might see. The correct
answer is (B).
29. The attitude of the speaker toward nature is
(A) utilitarian
(B) practical
(C) idealistic
(D) realistic
(E) uninformed
Nature in this poem has no mosquitoes sending you running for the bug spray. Instead, you
see a sea baring her breasts to the moon (line 5), howling winds compared to “sleeping flow-
ers” (line 7), and a “pleasant lea” (line 11). The only other answer remotely in the running is
(E), because you may conclude that the speaker is uninformed if he or she doesn’t take wet
feet, biting bugs, and other such annoyances into account. However, choice (C) fits best.
30. The rhyme scheme of the poem
(A) divides the poem in half
(B) unifies the first four lines and the last two
(C) creates a divide between the first eight lines and the last six
(D) is not related to meaning
(E) works contrary to the syntax
The rhyme scheme is abbaabbacdcdcd. (For more information on rhyme scheme, turn to
Chapter 4.) The break occurs after line 8, so (C) is the correct answer.

Crafting Solid Poetry Essays
Most people find writing an essay about a poem much easier than cracking the multiple-
choice code. (If you aren’t one of those people, turn to Chapter 7 for help.) No one ever said
that writing essays was easy, so in this section I provide some great poems and some sug-
gested essays. Before you start, take out a supply of lined paper. Just as you will on test day,
use the margins in this book for scrap and the lined paper for the answer you would submit
for grading.
The College Board suggests that you spend 40 minutes on each essay. To determine how
close you come to that goal, keep a clock in front of you as you work.

Read “After Apple-Picking” by Robert Frost. In a well-written essay, consider how the poet
uses diction, figurative language, and other poetic techniques to convey meaning(s) beyond
physical labor.
My long two-pointed ladder’s sticking through a tree
Toward heaven still,
And there’s a barrel that I didn’t fill
Beside it, and there may be two or three
Apples I didn’t pick upon some bough.
But I am done with apple-picking now.
Essence of winter sleep is on the night,
The scent of apples: I am drowsing off.
I cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
I got from looking through a pane of glass
I skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
And held against the world of hoary grass.
It melted, and I let it fall and break.
But I was well
Upon my way to sleep before it fell,
And I could tell
What form my dreaming was about to take.
Magnified apples appear and disappear,
Stem end and blossom end,
And every fleck of russet showing clear.
My instep arch not only keeps the ache,
It keeps the pressure of a ladder-round.
I feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend.
And I keep hearing from the cellar bin
The rumbling sound
Of load on load of apples coming in.
For I have had too much
Of apple-picking: I am overtired
Of the great harvest I myself desired.
There were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,
Cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall.
For all
That struck the earth,
No matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,
Went surely to the cider-apple heap
As of no worth.
One can see what will trouble
This sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is.
Were he not gone,
The woodchuck could say whether it’s like his
Long sleep, as I describe its coming on,
Or just some human sleep.

Read Sonnet 56 by William Shakespeare. In a well-organized critical essay, analyze how the
poet conveys his attitude toward love.
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
Which but today by feeling is allay’d,
Tomorrow sharpened in his former might:
So, love, be thou, although today thou fill
Thy hungry eyes, even till they wink with fullness,
Tomorrow see again, and do not kill
The spirit of love, with a perpetual dullness.
Let this sad interim like the ocean be
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
Come daily to the banks, that when they see
Return of love, more blest may be the view;
As call it winter, which being full of care,
Makes summer’s welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.
Answer Guide for Poetry Essays
If 100,000 people buy this book and write these essays (oh, may that be true!), about 99,999
different answers will appear. (I’m allowing for one “I practiced, Mom, honest! The video
game? Oh, that’s just background noise.”) Needless to say, I can’t print — or even imagine —
all possible answers. So here’s the deal: For each poetry prompt, I provide a list of points
that you might make about each poem, assuming you were working in an ideal world with no
time limit. On the real AP exam, you can score a five without including everything on my list.
My suggestions are simply there to help you see the possibilities. You may also come up with
an idea that I haven’t thought of. In that case, check to see whether you can justify your idea
with evidence from the poem. If so, count your idea as correct and give yourself a gold star.
General essay requirements
Before I go into specifics on each individual poem, I want to give you a checklist for the ele-
ments that should be in every good AP essay. Reread your work and decide whether you’ve
covered the basics. If not, try again. Here’s what you need to strive for:
 The essay needs an introduction containing the title of the poem enclosed in quotation
marks, the author’s name, and a thesis statement.
 The essay should be organized logically. You may proceed through the poem in line
order, making a point about each significant item. Or, you may group similar ideas into
different paragraphs. For example, you may place everything about figurative language
in one paragraph and everything about imagery in another.
 Ideally the essay should have a conclusion, not a summary or an abrupt stop.
 The essay must include evidence from the poem. Usually this evidence is given in the
form of quotations, which need to be punctuated properly. You may cite line numbers
in parentheses after the quotations.
 The essay should be written in present tense.
 You should have few grammar and spelling errors. Be sure to use complete sentences,
each ending with a period or a question mark. (Exclamation points are okay grammati-
cally but rarely justified in a formal essay.)

 You should check, check, and then recheck that you’re answering the question from
the prompt. Off-topic remarks should be crossed out.
Potential points for essay 1
I chose Dave Johnson’s wonderful poem for two reasons: It’s deceptively simple, and it gives
you practice in looking below the surface. And the humor in it doesn’t hurt either. Because
English teachers tend to fill their reading lists with tragedy, you’ve probably had more experi-
ence with sad pieces than with humor. And believe it or not, many AP exams include humor-
ous selections. This first essay gives you a chance to smile!
Main points
The crucial task, as explained in the prompt, is to decide how to characterize the mood of
the poem. At first the scene is comical, almost as if you were watching a reality-show prank.
By the end of the poem, however, you realize that the poet is working with more than humor.
The speaker follows the student out of the store, knowing that the student received a bad
lesson in dishonesty. Insisting that the student pay for the candy bar and the gum may have
counteracted the initial lesson, but the poem ends without an answer. The dominant mood is
uncertainty.
As long as you support your answer with evidence, you may be able to characterize the
mood differently and still do well on your essay. I can imagine a fairly good case for a “seri-
ous,” a “moral,” or a didactic mood. (Didactic means that someone’s teaching a lesson.) The
points that I list later can be tweaked to support any of these answers. However, if you stay
on the surface and say that the mood is “funny” or “comical,” you’ll likely write a fair essay
but not a good one.
Evidence
An essay about the poem “You Get What You Pay For” may include these points about poetic
technique and the mood of uncertainty:
 A few first-person narrative lines describe the situation, but the poem is mostly dia-
logue between the speaker and the student. By relying on dialogue, the poet stays on
the surface, thereby increasing the uncertainty.
 The margins seesaw between the speaker and the student, reflecting the two paths —
honesty and dishonesty. The seesaw emphasizes that the situation could go either way.
Again, this pattern reinforces the mood of uncertainty.
 The diction is colloquial (the way people really talk). Examples of this colloquial diction
include “That’s cool” (line 8) and “Geez” (line 14). The diction makes the situation
seem more real, as if the characters were actual people. With real people, the stakes
seem higher.
 The dialogue consists of short, staccato lines, which add a sense of urgency. One exam-
ple is “Out. Now.” (line 13). Reinforcing the uncertain mood, much of the dialogue is in
the form of questions (“Hey, don’t I know you?” and “What are you doing? / What does
it look like?” for example) Other dialogue expresses doubt: “I don’t know” (line 26).
 Syntax is also important in this poem. The narrative in line 28 employs a repetitive pat-
tern: I-verb. This pattern gives a sense of firmness and control. For example, consider
this statement: “I pull out my wallet. I take out two singles. I give them to the kid.” The
individual sentences are short, and nearly every word is a single syllable, implying that
the speaker is resolved; the student must be honest.
 The last line is very simple: “The kid gives the owner the money. The kid leaves. And so
do I.” The last bit — “And so do I” — isn’t a complete sentence. This fragment implies
that the speaker is now following the kid, who has been forced into honesty, but nothing
is certain. The story is incomplete, just as one’s decisions about life are often incomplete.

Organization
An essay about “You Get What You Pay For” may be organized in several different ways,
including these:
 An introduction may identify the mood of the poem. Then you can devote one body
paragraph for each poetic element (dialogue, diction, margins). The conclusion
addresses why this mood is effective for the topic of honesty. This structure is proba-
bly the best, though you have to sort your information quickly in order to place it in
the right paragraph.
 After an introduction identifying the mood of the poem, devote a body paragraph to
the teacher and another to the student. The conclusion explains how the interplay
between the two characters creates the mood. This structure is effective, but you have
to be careful not to repeat information, a real pitfall because the two characters con-
stantly interact.
 The quickest and simplest structure works through the poem, line by line, in order,
commenting on the poetic devices employed in each line.
Overall assessment
If I were an exam grader, I would expect to see the first three points because they’re the most
obvious and also the most important. If you include only those points, your essay should
score in the middle range. If you add two or three of the other ideas, your essay moves into
the highest-scoring slot. Of course, the exam graders also take into account how well you’ve
organized and presented the information. (For more details on scoring an essay, take a look
at Chapter 17 or Chapter 19, where I present scoring grids for essay questions.)
Potential points for essay 2
The prompt for the second sample essay asks you to figure out what apple-picking symbol-
izes, taking into consideration diction and figurative language. However, the prompt also adds
the phrase “and other poetic techniques.” This phrase means that you must make sure that
your answer includes more than diction and figurative language. If you stick with only those
two poetic techniques, your essay will probably rise no higher than the mid-range of scores.
Main points
First you have to decide what apple-picking represents. Yes, the poem is about a tiring physi-
cal activity, but the story doesn’t end there. The task of apple-picking also symbolizes the
way a person views life — the choices made and things left undone — as death approaches.
To use one of Frost’s most famous lines, the poem also considers “the road not taken” and
refers to the entire cycle of life.
You don’t have to cover every point I mention in order to do well. An excellent AP essay on
“After Apple-Picking” may focus on any single symbolic meaning cited in the preceding para-
graph, assuming that you make a strong case with ample evidence for your assertions.
Evidence
Now for some specifics, which are divided according to the poetic technique that they 
represent.
Following are points about imagery:
 The ladder is “two-pointed” (line 1), and the two points may be life and death or
heaven and hell. The ladder is reaching “[t]oward heaven” (line 2). This reference to
heaven implies that the speaker has left the world. In other words, the speaker has
died and is hoping to reach heaven.
116
Part II: Poetry in Motion 

 The speaker says “I am done with apple-picking” (line 6), a statement which is clearly
another reference to death. The barrel “I didn’t fill” (line 3) and the apples “I didn’t
pick” (line 5) symbolize tasks left undone. Life will continue without his presence.
 The reference to “hoary grass” (line 12) literally refers to ice upon the grass, probably
frozen dew. However, “hoary” is also used to refer to gray hair and the age at which one
gets gray hair — my age, which is old. Here you have yet another reference to the end
of life.
 The extended description of the apples (lines 18–20) represents the clarity one has as
death approaches. The moments of one’s life and the relative importance of each
become clear.
 The “rumbling sound” (line 25) has a link to thunder. Thunder alerts you to the fact
that trouble — lightning — is coming. Here it may be a sign of death’s approach.
Following are some points about diction:
 The vocabulary in the poem is quite simple, emphasizing the common, everyday aspect
of the experience of apple-picking. Everyone works, and everyone eventually dies.
 “[S]till” (line 2) means “even now,” but the word also means “motionless,” which (you
guessed it!) is an image of death. (Could this poem be any more of a downer?)
 The rhyme scheme is irregular, so the poet had no need to find a rhyme for “overtired”
(line 28). Therefore, “desired” (line 29) catches the reader’s attention, hinting at life’s
temptations and the way in which getting what one wants isn’t always satisfying. The
irregular rhyme scheme may also emphasize the unpredictability of life.
 The word “keep” is repeated twice (lines 22 and 24), emphasizing the dilemma — what
in life is worth keeping, and what should be given up?
Following are some points about figurative language:
 “[W]inter sleep” (line 7) is a metaphor for death or for the last period of one’s life.
 Many other references to sleep support the idea of death, including “I am drowsing off”
(line 8) and “I was well / Upon my way to sleep” (lines 14–15).
 The final reference to sleep asks whether “this sleep of mine” (line 38) is “like his /
Long sleep . . . [o]r just some human sleep” (lines 40–42). The speaker refers to the
woodchuck but actually wonders what death will be like.
 The morning and night — which symbolize the life cycle — are both mentioned. In the
morning, the ice sheet on the drinking water gives the speaker a “strangeness” (line 9)
in his or her sight, which the speaker “cannot rub” (line 9) away. Only when the
speaker is “[u]pon my way to sleep” (line 15) does the strangeness melt away. The
implication is that death clarifies one’s ideas.
 The “pane” of ice (line 10) represents a separation, perhaps the barrier between life
and death.
 The “ten thousand thousand” (line 30) apples, clearly an exaggeration (which is a
hyperbole in literary terminology), represent the events in the speaker’s life or the
tasks he or she had to accomplish. Each of the apples (tasks or moments) is something
to “[c]herish in hand . . . and not let fall” (line 31).
 Any apple that “struck the earth” (line 33), even if undamaged, is dumped into the
“cider-apple heap” (line 35), and is therefore worth less than the others. This tracks
the idea that in death, one’s value is diminished.
Following are some points about sound:
 The poem has no regular rhyme scheme, but some lines are grouped by similar words
at their ends. For example, line 2 ends with “still” and line 3 with “didn’t fill.” When you
link these words, you see that the poem is about what’s left unfinished.
117
Chapter 8: Flexing Your Poetry Muscles: Practice Questions

 Many of the words in the poem have just one syllable, giving the poem a simple beat. In
the same way, the poet is declaring a simple truth: At the end of life, you evaluate what
you’ve accomplished.
Organization
With so much material, this essay presents you with several potential structures. Here are
three:
 An introduction may explain several possible meanings for “apple-picking.” Then one
body paragraph may be devoted to each meaning, supported by an analysis of poetic
devices. The conclusion could address which meaning is most important. This struc-
ture calls on your organizational skills, because you have to pick apart the poem and
sort the points you want to make to support each meaning.
 An introduction may identify one possible meaning for “apple-picking.” Then you can
discuss each poetic device (one for figurative language, one for sound, and so forth) in
a separate body paragraph. The conclusion might step back and look at the poem as a
whole, explaining which technique is most important in creating meaning for “apple-
picking.” Like the preceding structure, you have to decide what goes where before writ-
ing. (Pre-writing is always a good idea, as I explain in Chapter 7. However, some struc-
tures are more forgiving than others when it comes to last minute decisions.)
 An essay may work through the poem, line by line, in order, commenting on the poetic
devices employed in each line and exploring possible meanings for “apple-picking.”
This structure allows you to make decisions as you write, so it’s fast and easy. It’s a
little less sophisticated than the other two I explain, but it’s still acceptable.
Overall assessment
After reviewing the previous lists, you may think that I’ve gone overboard in listing way too
many ideas about “After Apple-Picking” — and you’re right! I listed everything I could think
of in order to increase the chances of covering what you may have noticed. If you made one
or two points in each category or four or five points in just one category, you’ve done well.
If you came up with something I missed, it may be valid. Just be sure to support your ideas
with evidence from the poem — not from your own experience picking apples or doing some
other form of hard labor.
Potential points for essay 3
I couldn’t resist throwing in a Shakespearean sonnet, because (a) I love Shakespeare and (b)
so do the AP exam writers. Be grateful that the AP likes Shakespeare. Because just about
every English class covers Shakespearean sonnets, you have a fund of knowledge to draw
upon.
Main points
This beautiful Shakespearean sonnet begins with a plea to “Sweet love” (line 1). The speaker
may be addressing a real person (the beloved) or the love that the speaker has inside himself
for his beloved. Or, the speaker may be talking to love itself. These three meanings float
around the poem. The best essays take all three meanings into account, because each
reveals something different about the speaker’s attitude toward love.
The basic idea of the poem is that the lovers aren’t together — physically or emotionally.
The break will be temporary, however. The lovers will reunite, and their love will be renewed
and better. The speaker compares love to appetite; one may be hungry and eat, but the
appetite always returns. The speaker also envisions the lovers parted by the ocean, with
each of them on a different shore. Finally, the speaker sees the lover’s return as summer,
which is greeted with even more happiness after the iciness of the winter.
118
Part II: Poetry in Motion 

The ideas I provide in the preceding paragraphs, or at least most of them, should appear in
your essay. And as always in an AP English poetry essay, you have to relate how the poem is
written to what the poem means. The prompt asks you to convey the speaker’s attitude
toward love, so there’s your focus.
Evidence
Specific points you may make include:
 As mentioned earlier, “Sweet love” (line 1) may be the beloved or it may be love itself.
The technique used is called apostrophe. Apostrophe in a literary sense (not punctua-
tion) is a direct address to an idea or to a person who isn’t present. (You don’t need to
know the term apostrophe to receive a high score on the essay, but your grader will be
very impressed if you do.)
 Syntax is important in line 1 also. (Syntax is the grammatical identity of words in a sen-
tence.) First you have a command (“renew thy force”) and then a decree (“be it not
said”). You may expect the line to read, “renew . . . don’t allow our love to decay.”
Instead, the strong command is followed by something more passive. The speaker has
removed himself a little; he has placed a little space between himself and his desire.
 In line 2, love is compared to an edge, which may be blunt or sharp. This metaphor has
a whiff of danger in it. You can get hurt (perhaps cut or stabbed) if you fall in love. This
metaphor gives another hint that the relationship between the speaker and his beloved
isn’t going well.
 In line 6, the speaker mentions “hungry eyes” and a “wink.” Your eyes may appear to
wink when you’re falling asleep. In other words, the literal meaning of this line refers to
sleep. However, a wink may also be flirtatious, and the “hungry eyes” may be looking
for nonfood sustenance (think sex). And if the hunger is satisfied, it still returns. The
speaker assumes that love’s (or his lover’s) hunger, once fulfilled, will still return.
 Line 9 introduces the idea of “interim,” which is a temporary period. However, the com-
parison with the ocean makes that interim awfully large! The speaker returns to the
shore over and over again, waiting for love to return. While the poem expresses hope,
it also contains an element of despair. After all, ocean travel, particularly in
Shakespeare’s time, was dangerous. The ocean metaphor suggests the possibility that
the lover or the feeling of love will never return.
 Line 10 refers to “two contracted new.” In other words, the speaker is referring to new
lovers in the first flush of romance. They may be parted and do nothing more than
return to the shore, waiting to see each other again. The word “contracted” implies a
commitment, and “interim” (line 9) implies a temporary break. Both words add hope to
the poem.
 The syntax is a bit odd in line 13, but the phrase “As call it winter” actually belongs to a
sentence that was begun in line 9. The full sentence, paraphrased, is “This interim is
like the ocean or like winter.” Because summer always follows winter, the speaker is
expressing hope (or at least more hope than the ocean metaphor).
 “More rare” (line 14) means “more valuable,” as in the sense of a rare painting.
Therefore, “summer’s welcome” (line 14) will be more valuable because of the harsh
winter or ocean that has parted the lovers.
 The poem is a sonnet, with three groups of four lines (a quatrain, in lit-speak) and a
concluding couplet, or pair of lines. The rhyme scheme supports this division of the
poem. Because the couplet contains the reference to summer and winter, the poem
ends with hope, because seasons follow each other naturally. In other words, summer
must happen; the lover or the love must return.
119
Chapter 8: Flexing Your Poetry Muscles: Practice Questions

Organization
Sonnets are short, but as the list of points shows, you can say a lot about only 14 lines.
Therefore, structure is still important in a sonnet essay. Any of these organizational patterns
work well:
 The introduction states the poet’s attitude toward love and identifies the nature of love
in the poem — the beloved, the lover (speaker), and the emotion of love itself. Three
body paragraphs discuss each of those aspects of love. The conclusion compares the
human beloved to the abstract emotion, love. This structure follows the prompt
closely and is easy to organize.
 The introduction identifies the poet’s attitude toward love and then names the poetic
devices that the poet employs. One body paragraph explains each poetic device. The
conclusion identifies the most effective poetic device, the one that affects the reader
most intensely. As always when you’re sorting by poetic elements, you must take care
to decide before writing exactly what you want to say. This structure allows little room
for thinking as you write, unless you’re very good at tucking in extra ideas. (If you do
so, be neat and use a caret (^) for each insertion.)
 Follow the sonnet’s organizational pattern. After identifying the poet’s attitude, devote
one paragraph to each of the three quatrains and one to the couplet. The couplet para-
graph may serve as a conclusion, because that’s its role in the sonnet. (Convenient,
right?)
Overall assessment
As you rate your essay for the third sample prompt, consider yourself in great shape if
you’ve identified all three aspects of love and made four or five points, including an analysis
of the ocean/summer metaphors. If you found only two aspects of love, your grade may be a
point lower — but only if you have provided ample evidence. An essay considering only a
lover and his/her beloved would receive only a mid-range score, as would an essay relying
only on one poetic element.

Getting the Story from 
Prose and Drama

In this part . . .
I
magine a campfire in the days when campfires were the
latest discovery. What do you see? I see a bunch of
people sitting around telling stories — or, perhaps, acting
out stories, particularly the one about the wooly mam-
moth that got away. “Honest, I was so close! If Akakak over
there hadn’t sneezed . . . ” Then everyone chimes in: “We
should hunt earlier in the day . . . when I was a kid the
mammoths were bigger and woolier . . . ” In other words,
what I imagine is fiction (the stories), drama (acting out
stories), and nonfiction (essays and memoirs). These
types of writings are as old as humanity and as new as
the AP English exam you’re preparing to take.
In this part, I review the basics of prose and drama,
telling you what to look for in each. I also explain what
the College Board likes to test and how to approach each
multiple-choice and essay question. Finally, I provide a
wooly-mammoth-sized portion of practice.

M
eet Mr. Fiction and Ms. Drama, the fraternal twins of literature. On the outside, fiction
and drama appear completely different, but inwardly, they’re a lot alike. This chapter
is a reconnaissance mission through their home territory, explaining the basic elements of
each genre. The spotlight is on the twins as they usually appear on the AP English Literature
and Composition exam. Note: Nearly every point about prose fiction in this chapter also
applies to drama, with occasional, common-sense modifications.
Tell Me a Story: Fiction and Drama 
in the AP Exam
Prose fiction has a starring role on the AP English Literature and Composition exam, and
drama makes cameo appearances fairly often. Here’s what to expect:
 From a half to two thirds of the AP exam tests your ability to read fiction and drama.
That’s good news for those of you who break out in hives when you see a poem. (If you
get poetry hives, you may want to spend some quality time in Part II.)
 Literary selections usually include slices of novels and plays or whole (but very short)
stories.
 Most passages are about 800 words long, give or take a few paragraphs.
 Fiction and drama selections appear in both the multiple-choice and essay sections.
(You may also encounter a nonfiction selection. Chapter 10 tackles that topic.)
 Fiction and drama are always the basis for the third essay on the exam, which is the
open-ended one. What this means is that you get a prompt (a question), but no pas-
sage. Instead, the testers ask you to write about a novel or play of your own choice,
from memory. (You can find more information on this particular form of torture in
Chapter 14.)
Now that you know what’s coming your way, you can follow the Boy Scout motto and be 
prepared.

What’s Going On? Plot and Conflict
Short stories and novels are fueled by plot, or the set of events that propels the work for-
ward. Not many people care to read a story without a plot, and it’s also difficult to imagine a
bestseller wholly lacking in conflict, which is the fight or dilemma that characters face. I
explain both of these elements in detail in the following sections.
Plot: It’s not just a piece of land
When you’re writing an open-ended essay where you choose the literary work, plot is a big
deal. Without a text in front of you, incidents in the story become Exhibit A, basic evidence
for the case that you’re trying to prove. On the other hand, when a passage is provided (in
one of the other essays or in the multiple-choice section, for instance), plot sinks in impor-
tance. After all, unless the passage is a complete story, you see only a bit of the plot because
you’re reading less than a chapter’s worth of material. However, you still have to answer a
couple of questions or make some points based on plot. So you should have a solid under-
standing of how an author constructs a plot as well as how to locate those landmarks when
all you have is a snippet of the story to go by — I cover both in this section.
Recalling plot structure
Years ago a television show about New York City began with these lines: “There are 8 million
stories in the Naked City. This is one of them.” In the world of literature, 8 million is a conser-
vative estimate of the number of stories, or plots. Nevertheless, most fall into one classic pat-
tern, illustrated here:
1. The story begins with what English teachers call an initiating incident, the spark
that ignites the flame.
In Toni Morrison’s Beloved, for example, the attempted recapture of an escaped slave
and her children provokes a murder. The murder and its consequences propel the
action of the novel.
2. After the initiating incident, authors may throw in some background information, or
exposition.
For example, in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Mark Twain begins with a quick
summary of the events in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, the earlier novel that intro-
duced Huck and his surroundings.
124
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 
Prose, not cons
You may hear the term prose in English class or when
you’re discussing the AP exam. Prose is easy to recog-
nize, but difficult to define. Except for the bits of poetry
tucked here and there, most of this book is written in
prose. But the definition of prose is more than “anything
that’s not poetry.” Prose is ordinary writing — the kind
that has sentences and paragraphs. However, even that
definition needs more explanation. After all, some poems
are called prose poems. They look like run-of-the-mill
paragraphs, but when you read them, you enter a dense,
figurative world of meaning. (Chapter 18 contains a
prose poem.) Prose may also shed its paragraphs and
show up in drama; though some plays — Shakespeare’s,
for example — are written in verse. To make a long story
short (if it’s not too late for that already!), prose is a com-
plicated term for simple writing.

3. At this point, the events of the story move along, gathering importance. In lit-speak,
this progression is called rising action.
At some point the plot reaches its highest point of tension, where situations estab-
lished in the story have to come to some sort of resolution, which is referred to as the
climax. Herman Melville’s novel Moby-Dick reaches its climax when the crew of the
whaling ship Pequod battles the title character, a white whale.
4. The climax is followed by falling action, also known as the denouement, a long
word for the “how-it-all-worked-out” portion of the story.
Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park has a very short denouement. For 300 pages the heroine,
Fanny, has been pining away for this guy who thinks he’s in love with someone else. The
denouement simply tells the reader that in exactly the right amount of time, the guy
realizes that he never loved Miss Wrong and turns his attention to Fanny, who agrees to
marry him. This denouement takes about three paragraphs, tops. Other novelists — and
even other Austen novels — devote a chapter or two to the denouement.
Not every plot proceeds in chronological order. The story may begin in the middle and then
flash back to earlier events. You may also encounter foreshadowing, hints of future events, or
a frame story that “bookends” another plot. Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, for
example, has a frame story in which a university professor lectures on a manuscript (the
diary of the “handmaid” that forms the primary narrative). The lecturer’s comments begin
and end the novel.
If you’re faced with a non-chronological plot, think about why the author has messed with
the timeline. The reason may be relevant to your essay or may help you figure out a multiple-
choice question.
Plots are often accompanied by subplots as well. Subplots are minor stories that weave
around and through the main story line. In Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, for example,
Miss Havisham’s life story — and the reason she wears the same dress and only one shoe for
decades — is only one of many intriguing subplots.
Pinpointing plot landmarks in an excerpted passage
Recognizing plot points in AP exam passages may be easy, especially if the information is
presented in a straightforward manner. But don’t expect to see too many paragraphs in a
here’s-what-happened format, because those would be way too easy for an AP test. The evil
exam writers are more likely to choose their 800 words from a part of a novel or play that
doesn’t include background information. Without background, the task of answering ques-
tions becomes all the more difficult.
Don’t worry. I’m here to arm you with some tips that will make detecting the plot points a bit
easier. For instance, when reading fiction passages, be sure to ask yourself these questions
about plot:
 What happened? Check the passage and make a mental list of events.
 What events does the author leave out? The AP exam tests your ability to “read
between the lines” and make inferences. Reach beyond stated information into the
realm of probability, always grounding your guesswork firmly in the passage.
 What’s the timeline? In life, events happen one after another, but in fiction anything
goes. Information may be revealed out of chronological order. Mentally reconstruct the
order of events, and determine why the author may have chosen to structure the plot
this way.
125
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

More likely than not, you’ll see selections like the following one (albeit much longer) from
Louisa May Alcott’s novel Jo’s Boys:
Rob laughed, and, cheered by that unexpected sound, Nan bound up the wound with
hands that never trembled, though great drops stood on her forehead; and she shared
the water with patient number one before she turned to patient number two. Ted was
much ashamed, and quite broken in spirit, when he found how he had failed at the criti-
cal moment, and begged them not to tell, as he really could not help it; then by way of
finishing his utter humiliation, a burst of hysterical tears disgraced his manly soul, and
did him a world of good.
The passage isn’t impossible to read, but you have to fire up some brain cells to figure out
what’s going on. First, the basics: Rob laughs, and the sound makes Nan feel better. Nan
seems to have acted as a doctor, but nervously. Ted faints, cries, and begs the others not to
tell. Now you have to put on your Sherlock Holmes hat and stretch the basic plot points with
an educated guess: Rob was hurt, and Nan came to help. The injury has to be serious,
because Nan has “great drops” on her forehead. (She’s so scared she’s sweating.) Ted,
instead of making himself useful, must have fallen apart, and so he became “patient number
two,” which appears to be a sarcastic title. And if you stretch a little further, you see that Ted
is “ashamed” and the tears are “finishing his utter humiliation.” In the end, something hap-
pened beyond the fainting and the tears. You don’t know what, but you can guess that it was
something serious.
Conflict: The element that brings in 
all the dra-ma!
Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy once commented that all happy families resemble each other,
but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own unique way. Tolstoy’s observation may be the
reason why no one writes stories about perfect harmony. Conflict is simply easier to
scrounge up, and it’s almost always more interesting.
Conflict is essential to fiction, and so even a short AP passage generally depicts at least one
instance of unrest. The characters’ approach to the conflict, as well as its origin and resolu-
tion, may be the subject of AP questions.
Highlighting the conflict(s)
In a complicated work, some or even all of these conflicts may appear and interrelate:
 One character against another: This type of conflict is straightforward: One character
in a story has a grievance against another, and a battle ensues. A variation of this con-
flict sets one character against a few others. For example, Ralph, the leader of the
“good guys” in William Golding’s The Lord of the Flies, gradually comes into conflict
with Jack and later with Jack’s “tribe” of hunters.
 A character or group against society: This kind of plot pits a character against society
or a dominant group with a different agenda or values. In Harper Lee’s To Kill a
Mockingbird, lawyer Atticus Finch opposes the racist society in which he lives. Atticus
has several sympathizers, but many in the town condemn his defense of a falsely-
accused black man, Tom Robinson.
 A character against nature: Mother Nature, when she’s having a temper tantrum, plays
a central or supporting role in many novels and plays. Zora Neale Hurston’s novel Their
Eyes Were Watching God, for example, depicts horrors that the main character, Janie,
endures as she struggles to survive a fierce hurricane and subsequent flood.
126
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

 A character against himself or herself: Centuries before Freud invited the first patient
to lie down on the couch, psychology was already a part of literature. Writers have
always been aware of the contradictory inner emotions and impulses everyone experi-
ences. In Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Mrs. Ramsay struggles to preserve an
authentic self in the context of marriage and motherhood.
Conflict is most often expressed through action (see the preceding section on plot) or dia-
logue and description (discussed later in this chapter). The best writers can inject lots of
conflict into just a few words. Check out the technique in this tiny slice from At the Cross, a
novel by Dana Crum (© Dana Crum, reprinted with permission), which communicates con-
flict in several different ways:
“Affirmative action was never justified,” snapped the thin pale girl with red hair.
Sidney turned to the teaching assistant for help, but she was leaning forward, listening
with apparent interest, nodding with apparent commiseration.
The pale girl was looking right at Sidney now. “It’s just not fair that some people have it
easy while others are made to suffer. I’m from Scarsdale, New York, and some of my
friends from Exeter couldn’t even get into Princeton because the school lowered its
standards to let minorities in. It’s not my friends’ fault they’re White. Why should they
lose out just because minorities can’t score high enough?
Beneath Sidney’s shirt a trickle of sweat streaked from his armpit to his stomach. His
lips fell apart. But no words came out. He wanted to say that standards weren’t as high
when it came to White athletes like the husky football player, who’d so far misspoken
twice . . . 
Several events set up the conflict in the preceding excerpt: The pale girl’s comment and
Sidney’s silent glance at the teaching assistant, his physical reaction, and his thoughts. The
conflict? Sidney’s discomfort and disagreement with the pale girl and her views.
Looking at the conflict in its context
It isn’t enough to know who’s fighting whom or what. You also need to understand the con-
text of the conflict — what caused or solved the fight and how the conflict affects the plot.
Answering these questions helps you understand why the conflict is important in the novel,
play, or story.
Ask yourself these questions to identify and determine the significance of conflict:
 Has the question directed me toward one type of conflict? If so, zero in on the con-
flict that the question asks about. If the prompt queries you about nature, you obvi-
ously don’t want to write about a character pitted against society. Not addressing the
question earns you a zero on an essay (no matter how well written your essay is).
 Which characters are uneasy, angry, or fearful? Find the unhappy camper, and
chances are the conflict isn’t far behind.
 What caused the problem? In a short selection, information regarding the problem
may not appear, but you should always search for background information. Or, if you’re
desperate, you’ll have to read between the lines and make an educated guess. (I dis-
cuss this tactic earlier in the chapter.)
 What has to change in order to restore harmony or peace? Answering this question
helps you define the conflict.
 Is the conflict resolved? Not all stories have happy endings; many hinge on a charac-
ter’s unwillingness to change. In an AP passage, however, you may not find out the 
resolution.
 What effect does the conflict have? The easiest way to answer this question is to
imagine the story without the conflict. What changes? Now you know the effect of the
conflict.

Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

Where It’s At: Setting
Stories don’t take place in a vacuum. They’re embedded in a particular time and place, or set-
ting. (Okay, maybe a couple of science fiction tales do take place in the vacuum of Outer
Space, but in that situation the vacuum is part of the setting.) A surprising number of AP
exam questions address setting, so you need to be aware of all the ways in which this literary
element manifests itself. Keep the following points in mind:
 Some settings are so specific that you know the date and place. For instance, Arthur
Miller’s play The Crucible is set in Salem, Massachusetts, during the witch trials of 1692.
The setting of the literary work may symbolize another era or situation entirely. For
example, The Crucible deals with Salem, but Arthur Miller wrote the play to protest the
actions of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which investigated
Communism in American society during the 1950s.
 Some settings may be quite general. Perhaps the author indicates that the action
occurs in modern times — a period that includes anything from the early 20th century
through the present day. Or, the action may occur in an unnamed small town or large
city. William Golding’s The Lord of the Flies, for example, takes place on a deserted
island sometime in the modern era. No other details are supplied. The vagueness of the
setting, by the way, emphasizes the author’s point, which is that every society is vul-
nerable to cruelty and inhuman behavior.
 Much of the setting is created by description. The author may not tell you where and
when the scene takes place, but descriptive details often take the place of facts. In
James Fennimore Cooper’s novel The Deerslayer, Natty Bumppo journeys through the
wooded, sparsely inhabited Northeastern United States. Eloquent descriptions of the
forest and Glimmerglass Lake place you right there with Natty.
 Events and dialogue may contain clues regarding the setting, but these clues may be
tough to interpret if you aren’t knowledgeable about the time and place. For exam-
ple, characters who talk about “the bee’s knees” (meaning “the height of fashion”)
probably inhabit the 1920s. However, you may not know that fact if you haven’t read
much about that time period. If you don’t know the significance of a particular detail,
don’t guess. Rely on the information you understand to make your point.
It’s nice to know when and where the story takes place, but it’s much more important to con-
sider how the setting affects the story’s meaning. Ask yourself these questions:
 Why here? If the story were moved to another country or to a rural area rather than
an urban area (or vice versa), what would change?
 Why then? If the story were moved to an earlier or a later time, how would the story
be different?
 How do the characters fit into the setting? Are they in opposition to the setting — fish
out of water — or are they well situated?
 How does the action relate to the time and place? Could these events happen at any
time or just at one point in history? Similarly, could they happen in any place? Or is the
story universal?
 How do details of setting contribute to character development and/or theme? The
way a character’s room or house looks may tell you quite a bit about his or her person-
ality. Similarly, at times the setting may emphasize a theme. Again, the best way to see
the effect of a setting is to imagine the story moved to a different time or place.

Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Be wary of bringing history to bear on an AP exam question. I once read an essay about
Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre in which the writer discussed “Ms. Eyre’s job opportunities.”
The writer knew very little about the early 19th century, including the fact that the term
“Ms.” didn’t exist in that period. The essay, which advocated a career for Jane, made little
sense because becoming an attorney wasn’t an option for a woman of that era. Stay in the
world of the literary work as much as possible, and venture into history only if you’re
absolutely sure of the facts.
Who’s There? Characterization
I once attended an AP conference at which the presenter asked each of us to name a literary
character that we identified with. What people said was interesting, but the way they spoke
was amazing. Passion radiated from each speaker. Yes, everyone in the room was an English
teacher, and yes, as a group we’re nuts about literature. But ask the same question at other
gatherings, and I believe you’ll spark a similar amount of passion.
Why all this emotion? Because characters are people on paper, and people are interested in
people. That’s why characterization (the development of characters in a work) adds so much
to fiction; it’s the way writers manufacture fictional people. Recognizing the importance of
characterization, the AP exam hits this topic hard, questioning you about all the approaches
authors have at their disposal, including dialogue, description, actions, relationships with
other characters, and the like.
Overarching questions to consider
When you’re studying characterization and trying to figure out its effect on the story, ask
yourself these questions:
 Who’s the most important character? How do you know? After you examine your
answer, you’ll likely see the underpinnings of the characterization — the tools that the
author used to create the character.
 Which traits dominate? Some characters are flat; you see one or two personality traits
and nothing more. Other characters are more complicated, meaning that they’re gener-
ally more important. Look for dominant characteristics and for contradictory or minor
traits. For example, take note of a generous moment from a character that usually acts
like a miser. The brief change may be important.
 Does the character change? Static characters stay the same, and they generally act as
a background or foil for other characters. Dynamic characters are on the move, at least
in terms of personality. If you note changes in a character, chances are those changes
(and the character) are important.
 How would the story be different if a character were altered? The easiest way to
determine a character’s significance is to change the character’s personality or atti-
tude. Think of the effect that the change may have on the story. By working backward,
you can figure out the character’s role in the story as written.
What the characters look like
Looks can be deceiving. (Just ask smart, beautiful blondes how often they have to dispel the
impression that their brains focus only on surfing.) However, authors aren’t presenting real-
ity in their descriptions; instead, they’re stacking the deck by carefully selecting precisely
the right details. The type of clothing, the hairstyle, and even footwear can signal economic
level, insecurities, values, or personality.
129
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

Mrs. Joe in Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations, for instance, wears a stiff apron with pins
stuck into the bib. She’s resentful of her position as a blacksmith’s wife, and she’s stricter
than the teacher in your worst nightmare. The pin-filled apron perfectly mirrors her sharp
tongue, prickly personality, and resentful attitude. Her husband, on the other hand, has blue
eyes so light that they almost blend into the white surrounding them. Joe, as you may have
guessed, likes to be as inconspicuous as possible.
What the characters say . . .
As you read a piece of prose or drama, be sure to listen closely to the character(s). The level
of education, the age of the character, and the geographical home base of the character may
be revealed by his or her manner of speaking. And of course, the content may tell you about
the character’s preoccupations and relationships. However, be aware that as you determine
characterization the author may create a character who says one thing and means another
or who is self-deluded. Pretend that you’re listening to a real person, and then judge his or
her character as you do in real life.
In poetry, the “I” voice you hear is called the speaker. In prose, the “I” is the narrator, and the
main character is the protagonist. English teachers are picky about stuff like this, so don’t
confuse these terms.
. . . About themselves and to each other
Authors use dialogue to create a personality and background for their characters.
Characterization lays the backdrop for a story, just as every storyteller uses personality to
make a plot convincing and enticing. Here are some key points to remember:
 The main character may narrate the story. The first-person point of view is fun to
write, because you enter the mind of one character and create the world seen through
that character’s eyes. For example, check out this excerpt from a Sherlock Holmes’
story by Arthur Conan Doyle. The narrator is Dr. Watson:
My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness,
and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who first finds
himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my 
attention . . . 
Watson’s comments reveal that he’s an educated man — a doctor, in fact. He also
values proper behavior, as you see in his formal speech and his assumption that
“home-centered interests” rise up around married men.
 The characters may participate in dialogue. If you’ve ever eavesdropped in a restau-
rant or elsewhere, you know how much you can learn from other people’s conversa-
tions. Dialogue creates a literary “eavesdropping” opportunity. For instance, consider
what Sherlock Holmes says to Watson in the same story as the previous excerpt:
[M]y eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight
strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have
been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the
sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
Sherlock Holmes’ comments to Watson reveal his intelligence, logic, and sharp percep-
tion. The word “obviously” shows you that he thinks observation is easy, and he may
look down on those who aren’t able to match his own ability.
130
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Notice the formal, correct diction in the preceding Sherlock Holmes examples. It’s easy to
perceive Watson’s attachment to his home life and Holmes’ analytical mind. Contrast these
characters with Huck Finn, who’s the narrator in the following passage:
You don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures
of Tom Sawyer; but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he
told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the
truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was
Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.
Huck’s lack of education and straightforward, pull-no-punches manner come through clearly,
as does his cynicism about human nature.
. . . About each other
The information one character gives about another is a gold mine when you’re defining a
character. A character may provide background information, description, or an assessment
of another character’s life or personality. However, be sure to filter out the character’s bias.
For example, a poverty-stricken character may refer to another character as snobbish, listing
designer labels as proof. The assessment may be colored by the jealousy of the impover-
ished character.
Here’s Dr. Watson, discussing his friend Sherlock, in which he tells about Sherlock’s love life
(actually, lack of love life), his unease with emotion, and his intelligence:
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her
under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It
was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one
particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind.
The narrator or character giving you information may not be reliable. Unreliable narrators
are a lot of fun, and very popular on AP English exams. You know a narrator isn’t trustworthy
the same way that you know an acquaintance isn’t; something the narrator says doesn’t
mesh with the reality you observe. For example, in Dorothy Parker’s story, “You Were
Perfectly Fine,” a young woman reassures a very hung-over young man that he was “perfectly
fine” the night before, even as she describes the many ways in which he made a fool of him-
self, such as pouring clam juice down a friend’s back and greeting the waiter as a long lost
relation. (And, of course, he can’t remember any of these classy things that he did.)
How the characters behave and interact
Take note of the small, seemingly unimportant details when you’re trying to figure out a char-
acter. Anything a character does — or fails to do — contributes to his or her characteriza-
tion. Here’s what I mean: When a character picks up a check in a restaurant or heads for the
restroom just as the bill arrives, you learn something about that character’s attitude toward
money. When a character contemplates an action — to attend a party, perhaps — whether 
or not the character follows through reveals the character’s strength, determination, and 
priorities.
Noticing important actions
AP exam writers include passages that cover life’s major events — birth, death, freedom or
captivity, and so forth. Just as you pay attention to the big stuff in real life, you should note it
in literature as well. The way a character acts or reacts when the stakes are high reveals the
essential nature of the character.
131
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

For example, in Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer’s thoughtlessness and immaturity
are revealed when Tom allows the escaped slave Jim to believe that he’s been recaptured.
(Jim is unaware that he was set free months before.)
Here’s a passage (from Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility) that allows you a glimpse at
another important moment, a marriage proposal:
“Mrs. Robert Ferrars!” was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the
utmost amazement; and though Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes were fixed on
him with the same impatient wonder. [Edward] rose from his seat, and walked to the
window, apparently from not knowing what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay
there, and while spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as he
spoke, said, in a hurried voice, “Perhaps you do not know — you may not have heard
that my brother is lately married to — to the youngest — to Miss Lucy Steele.”
You don’t have to know much about Edward to grasp the fact that he’s nervous. (He’s about
to propose to Elinor, having narrowly escaped marriage to Lucy Steele.) After all, anyone who
cuts a scissor case into little pieces — when the case doesn’t even belong to him! — is not
exactly calm.
Being perceptive about body language
The response of one or more characters to another isn’t always verbal. These responses can
manifest themselves as body language as well. Therefore, you need to pay attention to the
interplay between characters for clues to their personalities. Although crossing one’s arms
or planting one’s feet firmly on the ground don’t qualify as earth-shaking events, these
actions tell you about emotions and personality.
Scan this excerpt from Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility to see how interactions can help
you glean clues about a character’s personality:
Marianne moved to the window. “It is Colonel Brandon!” said she, with vexation. “We are
never safe from HIM.”
“He will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home.”
“I will not trust to THAT,” retreating to her own room. “A man who has nothing to do
with his own time has no conscience in his intrusion on that of others.”
The event proved her conjecture right, though it was founded on injustice and error; 
for Colonel Brandon DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced that solicitude for
Marianne brought him thither, and who saw THAT solicitude in his disturbed and 
melancholy look, and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her, could not forgive 
her sister for esteeming him so lightly.
Marianne feels vexation (annoyance) at Colonel Brandon’s visit and views him as someone
“who has nothing to do.” These two reactions may lead you to dismiss Colonel Brandon as a
pest. However, Elinor’s reaction counters Marianne’s: Elinor sees the Colonel as “anxious”
about Marianne, and she “could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly.” Who’s
right about Colonel Brandon? Actually, Elinor is, but the AP exam will never ask you some-
thing that requires knowledge beyond the passage. Questions on the preceding example
would address the sisters’ differing views, not the correctness of their opinions.
A subset of “body language” is facial expression. When you’re answering questions about
characterization (what mood the character is in, for example), take note of smiles, frowns,
eyebrow lifting, forehead wrinkling, and all sorts of physical reactions. In the preceding
example, for instance, Colonel Brandon has a “disturbed and melancholy” look.
132
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Significant objects associated with the character
Hester Prynne wears a red “A” as punishment for her sin of adultery in Nathaniel
Hawthorne’s classic The Scarlet Letter. The future King Arthur proves his royalty by extract-
ing the sword Excalibur in T.H. White’s The Sword in the Stone. And of course, Harry Potter is
marked by his lightning bolt scar. These objects are forever associated with their characters
and affect the reader’s perceptions of them.
An author doesn’t need to be super-dramatic when employing objects as a means of charac-
terization. Something as small as a wallet or as commonplace as a hat may reveal a charac-
ter’s taste, income level, or aspirations. As an example, enter the dining room of Captain
Nemo’s submarine, as described in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne:
The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and we took our places.
Undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people, and, had it not been for the electric
light which flooded us, I could have fancied I was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel
at Liverpool, or at the Grand Hotel in Paris. . . . As to the dinner-service, it was elegant,
and in perfect taste. Each utensil — spoon, fork, knife, plate — had a letter engraved on
it, with a motto above it, of which this is an exact facsimile:
MOBILIS IN MOBILI N
The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical person who com-
manded at the bottom of the seas.
What can you tell about Captain Nemo from the plates and silverware? Well, for one, he’s a
stickler for the niceties. Who has ever heard of a five-star dining room on a sub! He’s also
proud (his initial is on every utensil), and he values movement (the motto means “Mobile in
the mobile element [water]”). That’s quite a bit of information from a dinner table.
What’s in Style? Tone, Diction, 
and Point of View
Every novel (and every story) has a style created by many elements of writing. Chief among
them are the author’s tone and diction and the point of view that he or she adopts. At a lec-
ture on grammar (yes, I’m nerdy enough to go to things like that), the speaker explained that
in the English language, double negatives make positive statements. He commented that “I
didn’t do no homework” actually means “I did some homework.” (In my opinion, however, it
means, “You have detention today.”) The lecturer added that double positives add emphasis
and are never negative. “Yeah, right!” commented someone in the audience.
I probably don’t need to explain that the tone of “Yeah, right” is sarcastic. Someone learning
English may need a little help decoding the expression, but most people catch the tone
immediately, especially when they hear the words spoken. Tone in literature functions much
the same as tone in an oral comment. The attitudes of both the characters and the author
come through. However, because you can’t actually hear the characters or talk with the
author, you have to gather clues from the text in order to determine tone. One of the most
important clues is diction, the particular words the author chooses.
The point of view of a story basically determines which demands the story places on the
reader. For example, in the first-person point of view (when the narrator speaks directly to
the reader), you must evaluate the narrator’s biases. You see the other characters from the
narrator’s point of view.
133
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

Tone and diction
In a story or novel, both tone and diction are usually more complex than they are in a poem.
(I discuss poetic devices in Chapter 4 — some of those ideas apply to fiction as well.) For one
thing, generally prose and drama have more characters than a poem (which may have no
characters at all). The diction and tone may differ for each character, and the author’s imper-
sonal descriptions may have still another tone or diction. All these factors complicate your
life, but when you untangle the various voices in a literary passage, you learn more about the
characters’ personality and the author’s views of his or her subject.
Knowing what’s worth noting
Some questions worth asking when assessing tone and diction include the following:
 How many narrators and characters does the text have? In a short AP selection,
chances are you’ll hear the voice of only one narrator. Full-length novels, which you
may discuss for the open-ended essay, may employ more than one narrator, and you
need to keep tabs on who’s saying what in the story. Tracking characters, of course, is
also essential, because you need to know the people who propel the story forward.
Tone and diction often differentiate one character from another. A dockworker sounds
different from an attorney, for example.
 Does a character’s tone shift? Particularly in a novel, but even in a short story, a char-
acter’s tone may shift from, say, nostalgic to analytical to depressed. The shift often
signals a plot development or adds depth to the characterization, as the character
evolves personally or reacts to events.
 Does the author’s tone or diction differ from that of the characters? The author’s
tone and diction may create a gap between what the characters say and do and the
point the author is making. For example, the author’s description may reveal the sad-
ness beneath a character’s sarcasm.
 If any words were changed, how would the story be affected? This question relates
directly to diction. Try rewording a sentence or two and watch what changes.
Figures of speech — similes, metaphors, personification, and a bunch of other imaginative
devices — are the building blocks of creative writing. And, creative writing, especially of the
AP variety, requires close reading, which is the English teacher term for “pay careful atten-
tion to language.” As you investigate diction, keep your eyes open for symbolism and nonlit-
eral expressions. (For a complete discussion of figurative language, turn to Chapter 4.)
Practice take #1 on noting tone and diction
The easiest way to understand tone and diction is to note them as they appear in a literary
work. Take a look at this excerpt from Oscar Wilde’s short story, “The Canterville Ghost.” As
you read, ask yourself how the narrative voice of the author and the language of each charac-
ter affect your perception of the work:
Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in black silk,
with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at
Lady Canterville’s earnest request, had consented to keep in her former position. She
made them each a low curtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned
manner, “I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.” Following her, they passed through
the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, paneled in black oak, at the end of
which was a large stained glass window. Here they found tea laid out for them, and, after
taking off their wraps, they sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited
on them.
Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace, and,
quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs. Umney, “I am afraid something
has been spilt there.”
134
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

“Yes, madam,” replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, “blood has been spilt on that
spot.”
“How horrid!” cried Mrs. Otis; “I don’t at all care for blood-stains in a sitting-room. It
must be removed at once.”
The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, “It is the blood
of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own hus-
band, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575. Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disap-
peared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been
discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much
admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.”
“That is all nonsense,” cried Washington Otis; “Pinkerton’s Champion Stain Remover and
Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,” and before the terrified housekeeper
could interfere, he had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a
small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the blood-
stain could be seen.
“I knew Pinkerton would do it,” he exclaimed, triumphantly, as he looked round at his
admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning
lit up the sombre room, a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and
Mrs. Umney fainted.
How many tones can you identify throughout this passage? Make your way through the fol-
lowing list to see whether you found the ones that I did:
1. First, check out the housekeeper, Mrs. Umney.
She speaks in a “low voice” and a “low, mysterious voice” about blood from a centuries-
old murder. Her tone is serious, slightly spooky, and self-important, as is her diction.
Only she can give the vital information about the “guilty spirit” that “still haunts” the
house — and she “smiled” while giving this information. (Talk about spooky!)
2. Next up is Mrs. Otis.
This lady doesn’t “care for blood-stains in a sitting-room.” She’s used to getting her
way: “It must be removed at once.” Her tone is commanding. She speaks, as does her
husband, with formal diction, and she knows her power. Notice that she says, “I don’t
at all care for blood-stains in a sitting-room.” What Mrs. Otis cares about is obviously
vitally important (in Mrs. Otis’s view).
3. Now look at Washington Otis.
His tone is completely different from Mrs. Umney’s. “That is all nonsense,” he declares
and praises “Pinkerton’s Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent.” His remark,
“I knew Pinkerton would do it,” is said “triumphantly.” Otis is a man of action, a
believer in his own ability to get things done, a believer in progress. His tone is confi-
dent, and his diction is plain and straightforward. No fancy words for him! And no hints
of underlying meanings.
4. Finally, what about the author? Step back and look at the passage as a whole.
Can you see the humor in the interplay between Mrs. Umney and the Otis family?
Notice how the passage begins like a classic gothic novel, with an aged housekeeper
“neatly dressed in black silk” leading the family into a library paneled in dark oak,
where tea is laid out. How many horror stories have begun this way? Lots! And how
many of these stories have Pinkerton’s Champion Stain Remover and Paragon
Detergent”? Only this one. These two facts clue you in to Wilde’s mocking tone. He
inserts practical Americans into an English manor and, more importantly, into a gothic
story, which includes supernatural elements, mysteries, old houses, scary housekeep-
ers, and the like. He especially has fun in the long last sentence, which forms one para-
graph: Just as Otis erases the stain, “a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room
. . . and Mrs. Umney fainted.”
135
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

Practice take #2 on noting tone and diction
Now take a crack at determining the tone and diction of another literary passage. Here’s an
excerpt from “A Scandal in Bohemia,” a Sherlock Holmes story narrated by Dr. Watson:
One night — it was on the twentieth of March, 1888 — I was returning from a journey to
a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker
Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my
mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized
with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraor-
dinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall,
spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room
swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him.
What tone do you “hear” in Watson’s narration? I hear precision; Watson takes care to specify
the date. I also hear fussiness; he backtracks to insert information (his return to civil prac-
tice, the associations of the “well-remembered door,” and so on). Finally, I hear admiration.
Watson describes Holmes’ rooms as “brilliantly lit.” His choice of words echoes the doctor’s
admiration for Sherlock Holmes’ “extraordinary powers.” Watson’s diction is formal, edu-
cated, but a bit fussy. He speaks of “wooing” and “dark incidents.”
Point of view
Literature provides a lens through which readers look at the world. Skillful authors can fix
their readers’ attention on exactly the detail, opinion, or emotion the author wants to empha-
size by manipulating the point of view of the story. Point of view is the way the author allows
you to “see” and “hear” what’s going on.
Point of view comes in three varieties, which the English scholars have handily numbered for
your convenience:
 First-person point of view is in use when a character narrates the story with “I-me-my-
mine” in his or her speech. The advantage of this point of view is that you get to hear
the thoughts of the narrator and see the world depicted in the story through his or her
eyes. However, remember that no narrator, like no human being, has complete self-
knowledge or, for that matter, complete knowledge of anything. Therefore, the reader’s
role is to go beyond what the narrator says.
For example, Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird is told from the point of view of Scout,
a young child. She doesn’t grasp the complex racial and socioeconomic relations of her
town — but the reader does, because Scout gives information that the reader can inter-
pret. Also, Scout’s innocence reminds the reader of a simple, “it’s-not-fair” attitude that
contrasts with the rationalizations of other characters.
 Second-person point of view, in which the author uses “you” or “your,” is rare; authors
seldom speak directly to the reader. When you encounter this point of view, pay atten-
tion. Why? The author has made a daring choice, probably with a specific purpose in
mind. Most times, second-person point of view draws the reader into the story, almost
making the reader a participant in the action.
Here’s an example: Desperate Characters is a book-length poem by Nicholas
Christopher in which all sorts of magical events occur — libraries appear and disap-
pear, characters sort out karma from another life, and Thomas Jefferson makes a
cameo appearance in the 20th century. Christopher said that he chose the second-
person point of view because that’s how most people explain their dreams.
136
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

 Third-person point of view is that of an outsider looking at the action. The writer may
choose third-person omniscient, in which the thoughts of every character are open to
the reader, or third-person limited, in which the reader enters only one character’s
mind, either throughout the entire work or in a specific section. Third-person limited
differs from first-person because the author’s voice, not the character’s voice, is what
you hear in the descriptive passages.
In Virginia Woolf’s wonderful novel, Mrs. Dalloway, you’re in one character’s mind at a
time. You know the title character’s thoughts about Peter, the great love of her youth,
for example, and then a few pages later, you hear Peter’s thoughts about Mrs. Dalloway.
Fascinating! When you’re reading a third-person selection, either limited or omniscient,
you’re watching the story unfold as an outsider. Remember that most writers choose
this point of view.
Consider these issues when you discuss point of view in an AP essay:
 What does the point of view add to the story? Do you get to know one character
extremely well? Has the author created a unique voice? Is the author’s attention fairly
divided among several characters?
 What are the limitations of the point of view? Are you getting only part of the story?
What must you add, as the reader? Be alert to the details you can’t get from the point
of view that the author chose. Spend a moment considering what you aren’t being told.
What’s the Big Idea? Themes
When you read great literature, you come away from it with deep thoughts about The
Meaning of Life. In other words, literature explores themes, the big ideas that philosophers
contemplate for a living. Regular books, such as this one, don’t. A theme is different from a
subject, however. The subject is what the book is actually about — the people or events in
the story. The theme is the idea expressed by means of the subject.
Consider Miguel de Cervantes’ novel Don Quixote, for example. The subject of the novel is a
crazy old man’s quest for the ideal of knighthood. On the other hand, the themes of Don
Quixote include the nature of reality, the extent to which human beings need illusions to get
through life, and other important issues. I first read Don Quixote four decades ago, and I still
revisit it from time to time. With each reading, I wonder again: Is it better to work toward an
impossible goal or to give up and take life as it is? In other words, I ponder the book’s theme.
AP literary selections, not surprisingly, are dense with themes. The exam usually includes at
least one or two multiple-choice questions addressing theme, and it may be an element to
include in one of your essays.
To identify the theme(s) of a work, ask these questions:
 Why should I read this literary work? You aren’t allowed to answer, “Because it’s on
the test.” Instead, think about why a literary work has value. What can you learn from
it? Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, for instance, has lasted for more than 200 years —
and not just because it’s funny. The lovers’ struggle to grow up and to give up their pre-
conceived ideas strikes a chord in readers, as does the characters’ belief that they’re
smart enough to know what they’re doing — even when they aren’t! Modern readers
can identify with the themes of pride and prejudice.
The title of a work is often a clue to its theme. (Pride and Prejudice is a case in point.)
137
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

 What does the story reveal about life? Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the
Western Front follows troops in the trenches of World War I. This specific situation is
interesting and historically important, but the book also reveals how people behave
when they’re in mortal danger; it surveys their courage and concerns. It also shows the
callousness of people on the home front who don’t really want to know what the sol-
diers are going through. The novel addresses the themes of honor, cowardice, violence,
and willful ignorance.
 What will you be thinking about after you read the book? Ten years later, what will
matter? That Elizabeth marries Darcy or that prejudice gets in the way of a good rela-
tionship? Chances are that when the details of the plot fade, the ideas — the themes —
remain.
The Play’s the Thing: Drama Particularities
Your AP English exam (three hours of nonstop fun!) may include a drama passage that’s writ-
ten in either prose or verse (poetry). Even though some exams have no drama passages,
every exam gives you the option of writing about drama when you answer the third, open-
ended essay question.
Theater is a collaborative art, and playwrights must resign themselves to the fact that human
actors will inhabit the characters, giving a physical body and a unique interpretation to the
dialogue. Set designers, directors, costume designers, and many others have roles in the cre-
ation of a play.
On the AP English Lit exam, however, you don’t see a play. You read one. You have to work
from the script provided (or remember the play, in the case of the open-ended essay). With
drama passages, you have three elements to help you: set description, stage directions, and
lines of dialogue. Not a lot! Plus, at times you may find that one of the three elements is miss-
ing. From such minimal material you have to deal with questions about plot, conflict, charac-
terization, theme, and so forth.
Treat a dramatic selection as you would any piece of fiction, but pay special attention to
what the characters say (dialogue), how they say it (tone), and what they do (plot). Also,
take note of any directions from the playwright about setting, movement, and so forth.
Plot, conflict, and theme
Plot, conflict, and theme are present in plays as well as in novels and stories. The difference
between these elements in prose and in drama is that you have to flesh out the skeleton of a
dramatic script by imagining the play on a stage. As with prose AP questions, expect to find
slices of a play that leave you with some plot points to figure out.
Plays often begin with heavy doses of exposition, the background information that helps you
understand the scene in front of you. If you’re writing about a play, you don’t need to provide
that exposition in your essay, however. You can assume that the readers know the back-
ground of the classic, taught-everywhere works. (If you’re writing about a lesser known work,
a bit of exposition is a good idea. Check out Chapter 14 for instructions about how to include
background material on open-ended essays concerning non-classic literature.)
138
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

The same conflicts outlined earlier in this chapter show up in plays. However, the limitations
of performance decrease the instances of the “character versus nature” conflict (though I did
once get soaked at a too-realistic performance of the storm scene from Shakespeare’s The
Tempest.)
One element of theater lends itself nicely to the depiction of internal conflict: the dramatic
monologue. In a dramatic monologue, a character speaks at length to an implied listener. The
character may be alone on stage or in the presence of other, silent observers. When the char-
acter is strictly alone and is simply voicing his or her thoughts, the speech picks up another
title: soliloquy. Shakespearean tragedies are filled with wonderful monologues and solilo-
quies; Prince Hamlet alone recites four soliloquies. Because the plays are written in verse,
you may see a Shakespearean soliloquy and assume that you’re reading a poem. And you’re
sort of correct: You’re in drama-land, but all the techniques for decoding poetry apply. (See
Chapter 4 for the lowdown on poetic devices.)
Themes, the ideas that the playwright considers, are every bit as important in dramatic
works as they are in novels and stories. As in prose fiction, plot and dialogue help you figure
out the themes of a work. And because you have little more than dialogue to work from on
the AP English exam, you need to turn a microscope on the words in a drama passage.
Consider not only a character’s particular situation but also the broader level beneath his or
her words.
In Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, for example, Willy Loman’s long-suffering wife 
makes a passionate case that “attention must be paid” to Willy. The specifics of Willy’s
predicament — that he has lost his job, he’s heavily in debt, and he’s losing his grip on 
reality — are important. The theme, however, is universal: the common or “low man” (notice
how the name relates?) is just as valuable as someone with a prominent position in society.
As another example, here’s a bit of Oscar Wilde’s comedy The Importance of Being Ernest:
ALGERNON — You have invented a very useful younger brother called Ernest, in order
that you may be able to come up to town as often as you like. I have invented an invalu-
able permanent invalid called Bunbury, in order that I may be able to go down into the
country whenever I choose. Bunbury is perfectly invaluable. If it wasn’t for Bunbury’s
extraordinary bad health, for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dine with you at Willis’s
tonight, for I have been really engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a week.
JACK — I haven’t asked you to dine with me anywhere tonight.
ALGERNON — I know. You are absurdly careless about sending out invitations. It is very
foolish of you. Nothing annoys people so much as not receiving invitations.
The plot of Wilde’s play revolves around these two bachelors, Algernon and Jack, and their
social obligations and relationships. However, even if you aren’t familiar with the work, you
can still get a lot from this short excerpt. Algernon and Jack excuse themselves from undesir-
able social invitations by pleading other obligations. Jack uses a fictitious younger brother,
“Ernest,” and Algernon tends to an imaginary sick friend, “Bunbury.” Algernon has accepted
an invitation to dine with his Aunt Augusta, but he will cancel because “Bunbury” needs him.
Setting: The fine print
If you see a play performed, the stage set literally shows where the characters are. If you’re
reading a dramatic selection, you have to rely on stage directions or author’s notes to clue
you in, so don’t — I repeat, do not — breeze past them! If you do, you’ll likely miss some very
important information.
139
Chapter 9: Reading Fiction and Drama Passages

Even without a description of the stage set, you may still be able to determine when and
where the action happens. How? From the dialogue and plot. (The section “Where It’s At:
Setting” earlier in this chapter explains how.)
Here are Eugene O’Neill’s notes about the setting of Anna Christie:
SCENE — “Johnny-The-Priest’s” saloon near South Street, New York City. The stage 
is divided into two sections, showing a small back room on the right. On the left, for-
ward, of the barroom, a large window looking out on the street. Beyond it, the main
entrance — a double swinging door. Farther back, another window. The bar runs from
left to right nearly the whole length of the rear wall. In back of the bar, a small showcase
displaying a few bottles of case goods, for which there is evidently little call. The remain-
der of the rear space in front of the large mirrors is occupied by half-barrels of cheap
whiskey of the “nickel-a-shot” variety, from which the liquor is drawn by means of spig-
ots. On the right is an open doorway leading to the back room. In the back room are four
round wooden tables with five chairs grouped about each. In the rear, a family entrance
opening on a side street.
It doesn’t matter where the bar is or how long it is, but if you see information like this on the
exam, you can pick up some details to help you interpret the scene. Notice, for example, that
there is “little call” for the more expensive “case goods” and that the “half-barrels of cheap
whiskey of the ‘nickel-a-shot’ variety” occupy a lot of space. These are all indications that the
patrons of the bar have little money.
Characterization: Monologue, dialogue, 
and brackets tell all
The playwright may tuck in a few stage directions, which are usually placed in square brack-
ets, about the character’s mood, actions, or tone of voice. However, you’re mostly working
from dialogue in determining characterization. Therefore diction (word choice) and syntax
(the way the words are put together grammatically) deserve special attention because
they’re the most important clues to the character’s ideas, values, background, and emotions.
(See the earlier section “What’s in Style? Tone, Diction, and Point of View” for a discussion of
tone and diction in prose. The information there also applies to dramatic passages.)
Check out this excerpt from Eugene O’Neill’s play Anna Christie, in which two longshoremen
(dockworkers) enter a bar:
FIRST LONGSHOREMAN — [As they range themselves at the bar.] Gimme a shock.
Number Two. [He tosses a coin on the bar.]
SECOND LONGSHOREMAN — Same here. [Johnny sets two glasses of barrel whiskey
before them.]
FIRST LONGSHOREMAN — Here’s luck! [The other nods. They gulp down their whiskey.]
SECOND LONGSHOREMAN — [Putting money on the bar.] Give us another.
FIRST LONGSHOREMAN — Gimme a scoop this time — lager and porter. I’m dry.
The dialogue here is minimal; these guys want to drink, and they aren’t interested in socializ-
ing or etiquette. The stage directions indicate actions (tossing a coin, gulping the whiskey),
but you get just as much information from the slang “gimme” as you do from the author’s
comments. And look at the difference between the two men: The first is interested only in
himself (“gimme”), but the second says, “Give us another.”

. . . And Nothing but the Truth: 
Reading Nonfiction Passages
In This Chapter
 Exploring nonfiction AP passages
 Identifying nonfiction literary techniques
 Analyzing selections from essays, memoirs, and biographies
A
lthough nonfiction (my favorite genre!) is defined mostly by what it is not — made-up
stories such as those found in novels and plays — it has its own set of defining charac-
teristics: Nonfiction is argument, discussion, life stories, instruction, and more. It’s creative,
because although you can’t mess with the subject matter, you do have to come up with an
effective and interesting way to get your message across to the reader. You won’t see many
nonfiction passages on the AP English Literature and Composition exam, but you still need
to be prepared just in case. You don’t want to be caught unaware. This chapter whisks you
through the types of nonfiction that the AP exam writers favor. Read on for the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth about AP English nonfiction.
A Preview of Nonfiction on the Exam
Once in a blue moon — that’s how often to expect a nonfiction passage on the AP English
exam. Not often, but more importantly, not never either. When nonfiction shows up, you
should be prepared to tackle it. Remember that the AP exam includes only seven or eight lit-
erary selections. Do you really want to risk one seventh or one eighth of your points? I didn’t
think so.
If you see nonfiction on the exam at all, you’ll have just one passage, usually of 800 words or
less. Here are the types of excerpted nonfiction passages you may see on the exam:
 Essays: An essay may discuss an idea without taking a stand or may advocate a partic-
ular viewpoint, which you have to identify.
 Autobiographies, memoirs, or biographies: Real events told by real people about their
own or others’ lives. What could be more interesting? Expect to see one “episode” in
someone’s life or perhaps an overview.
With these types of passages, the exams usually pose questions about content and tech-
nique. Literal questions test your ability to decode the text, which may be on a difficult read-
ing level. Interpretive questions address your ability to infer information that isn’t stated
directly. The AP writers also want to know why a particular writing technique appears and
how the style affects the readers’ perception of the text.

In what are called paired-passage questions, you may see a nonfiction passage coupled with
another nonfiction passage or with a fiction selection. In this situation you have to compare
and contrast information, purpose, tone, and so forth. (See Chapter 15 for more information
on this two-for-the-price-of-one deal.)
Because you’ve been reading and writing nonfiction all your life, you probably know a lot
about this genre already. But to improve your score on AP nonfiction questions, you need to
bone up on a few terms — what various techniques are called — and pay attention to how a
piece of writing is constructed. Then you’re on the way to a high score. I explain everything
you need to know in this chapter.
Arguing and Exploring Ideas: The Essay
It seems strange to explain how to read and analyze an essay to someone who’s preparing to
write three of them on the AP exam. After all, at this point in your academic career you’ve
probably written enough homework and test essays to wallpaper your room. The essays you
write and the ones you have to read on the AP exam are related, but not closely. Think of
them as second cousins once removed. AP exam essays are dense with ideas, and they gen-
erally feature difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences. Nevertheless, with the right
approach, you can crack the code.
When you’re reading an AP exam essay selection, you need to pay attention to structure.
Also take note of diction, syntax, and tone. As a bonus, besides preparing you for AP ques-
tions, a close reading of sample essay selections teaches you a couple of writer’s tricks to
improve your own creations.
College admissions essays, those delightful tasks facing high school seniors every autumn,
are generally quite different from the essays you read and write on the AP English exam.
College essays have one goal: to reveal more about you to the admissions office. (I know, you
have one goal too: to get in.) College admissions essays include statements about your ideas
and beliefs, but they mostly resemble short narratives. They usually fall closer to the cate-
gory of memoir or autobiography. By the way, if you’re having trouble writing your college
essays, feel free to boost my ego by consulting my book on the subject, College Admissions
Essays For Dummies (Wiley, 2003).
Finding meaning in essay structures
An essay is an exploration of ideas. The author is often arguing — and sometimes screaming —
a point of view. A few basic structures dominate essays. After you identify the structure, you
can usually follow the logical thread of the author’s discussion fairly easily. Here are the most
common structures, with some examples:
 Problem and solution: This type of essay is heavy with evidence — supporting facts
for both the problem and the solution. For example: The high cost of radishes has ruined
the world (or the nation, the kitchen, the dog, or whatever). Strict price controls will solve
the problem.
 Cause and effect: The conclusion of this kind of essay generally evaluates the effect. It
comes to the conclusion that a particular result is the best outcome ever or that it will
lead to the end of the world, the galaxy, and quite possibly the universe. For example:
You slapped me, so I’m aiming my supercharged blaster ray at you.
A variation of “cause and effect” is “effect and cause”: I blasted you with my super-
charged blaster ray because you slapped me. The order of the essay is different, but the
content is the same.
142
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

 Compare and contrast: Similarities and differences are the meat of this kind of essay.
For example: Potato chips were better in the old days. They’re still salty, but they’re not as
crispy because now they’re fried in spring water.
 Assertion and defense: You write this sort of essay in school all the time; you state a
thesis and then support it with evidence. For example: The best things in life aren’t free!
Cable TV is expensive.
 Anecdote and interpretation: This type of essay tells a story and explains its signifi-
cance. For example: One day Boris tripped on a crack in the sidewalk. That trip changed
his life because . . . . Everyone else should trip on the sidewalk too.
 Question and answer: This essay poses a question and then answers, or attempts to
answer, it. For example: Why do fools fall in love? They need a date for the prom, a
reason to fail math, and so on. Another example: What’s the basis of existence? Library
books, watermelons, the Yankees, and similar stuff.
Care to test-drive your structural skills? Here’s a paragraph by one of the most famous essay-
ists in the English literary tradition, Francis Bacon. Read the excerpt and determine how it’s
structured.
TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of education, in the elder, a part of experience. He
that travelleth into a country, before he hath some entrance into the language, goeth to
school, and not to travel. That young men travel under some tutor, or grave servant, I
allow well; so that he be such a one that hath the language, and hath been in the coun-
try before; whereby he may be able to tell them what things are worthy to be seen, in
the country where they go; what acquaintances they are to seek; what exercises, or dis-
cipline, the place yieldeth. For else, young men shall go hooded, and look abroad little.
Even in this short passage, you can detect the author’s structure: assertion and defense.
Bacon is famous for packing a whole lot of ideas into a small space, as you see in the preced-
ing sample, so he isn’t always easy to decode. He doesn’t bother with stories (for example:
Mike went to Antarctica alone and did nothing but chase penguins.). Nor does Bacon spend a
lot of time elaborating. After he has the idea on paper, he moves on. In this slice of his essay
entitled “Of Travel,” the point he’s asserting is simple: Because travel is educational for
young people, “the younger sort” should travel with a “tutor” or “grave servant” who “hath
the language” of the country being visited. He backs up this assertion with reasons: The
tutor/servant “may be able to tell [the youngster] what things are worthy to be seen . . . what
acquaintances . . . to seek” and what may be learned there (“what exercises, or discipline, the
place yieldeth”). His punch line may be restated this way: If young travelers don’t travel as
he suggests, they may as well “go hooded” because they’re flying blind.
Here’s another example. This time the excerpt comes from American essayist Ralph Waldo
Emerson. Again, read the passage and then check out the structure:
It has been said that “common souls pay with what they do, nobler souls with that
which they are.” And why? Because a profound nature awakens in us by its actions and
words, by its very looks and manners, the same power and beauty that a gallery of
sculpture or of pictures addresses. Civil and natural history, the history of art and of 
literature, must be explained from individual history, or must remain words. There is
nothing but is related to us, nothing that does not interest us, — kingdom, college, tree,
horse, or iron shoe, — the roots of all things are in man. Santa Croce and the Dome of St.
Peter’s are lame copies after a divine model. Strasburg Cathedral is a material counter-
part of the soul of Erwin of Steinbach. The true poem is the poet’s mind; the true ship is
the ship-builder. In the man, could we lay him open, we should see the reason for the
last flourish and tendril of his work. . . .
143
Chapter 10: . . . And Nothing but the Truth: Reading Nonfiction Passages

As you may have guessed, this excerpt rests on a question-and-answer structure. Emerson
takes his time, so his style differs from the text-message effect Bacon achieves in the previ-
ous example. The question is why do “common souls” matter because of “what they do” and
“nobler souls” because of “that which they are”? The answer is that once you’re “nobler” or
“profound,” you radiate “power and beauty” just as art does. The rest of the excerpt equates
art with the artist, who presumably is as profound as possible, whether designing a cathe-
dral or writing a poem.
If you’re writing an essay about an essay (for some reason I love saying that) or answering
multiple-choice questions about an essay, X-ray the passage until you detect the structure.
Understanding how the piece is organized helps you decode its meaning more efficiently and
accurately. Working from an understanding of the structure, you can break down the many
parts and analyze each.
Paying attention to rhetorical techniques
In the old days — the very old days, as in ancient Greece and Rome — students practiced
rhetoric, the art of persuasive speaking. The students’ goals were to become orators who
were capable of convincing and thrilling their audiences. More recent writers have employed
many of the same techniques to get their messages across. (Then they take jobs in advertis-
ing.) Many rhetorical techniques, especially those tested on the AP exam, relate to diction
(word choice) and syntax (the grammatical design of a sentence). Diction and syntax help
you identify the tone of the essay — the attitude the author takes toward the subject.
A few hundred terms describe rhetorical techniques, and a few thousand more relate to
grammar. Fortunately for you, almost none of this specialized vocabulary shows up on the
exam. You just have to dissect the essay and characterize what you find there.
Close reading of an essay pays off. Going through the following points when you’re answering
questions about an essay will force you to take the time to read a passage closely:
 What overall impression does the language make? Is it formal or informal?
Conversational? Observational? Detached? Judgmental? Are the words simple or
unusual? Relate the diction to the content, if possible.
 Why did the essayist choose this particular word or phrase? To find out, substitute
another word and see what changes.
 What is the sentence pattern? In other words, are the sentences long or short? Do you
see repetition? Does the sentence follow the usual subject-verb order, or do you detect
a different pattern? After you’ve answered these questions, try to link the answers to
the content of the essay.
 What does the author think about the subject? Identifying the author’s attitude helps
you understand the points that he or she makes in the essay.
The easiest way to understand diction, syntax, and tone is to observe them in action. Read
this passage, excerpted from an essay by Leslie Stephen, and consider the rhetorical tech-
niques he uses:
Goethe says somewhere, that as soon as a man has done any thing remarkable, there
seems to be a general conspiracy to prevent him from doing it again. He is feasted, fêted,
caressed; his time is stolen from him by breakfasts, dinners, societies, idle businesses of
a thousand kinds. Mr. Buckle had his share of all this; but there are also more dangerous
enemies that wait upon success like his. He had scarcely won for himself the place
which he deserved, than his health was found shattered by his labors. He had but time
to show us how large a man he was, time just to sketch the outlines of his philosophy,
144
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

and he passed away as suddenly as he appeared. He went abroad to recover strength for
his work, but his work was done with and over. He died of a fever at Damascus, vexed
only that he was compelled to leave it uncompleted. Almost his last conscious words
were: “My book, my book! I shall never finish my book!” He went away as he had lived,
nobly careless of himself, and thinking only of the thing which he had undertaken to do.
To crack this passage, you need to examine diction, syntax, and tone. Use the guidelines I
provide earlier in the section to come up with your own analysis, and then compare your
observations to what I discovered when I dissected Stephen’s prose:
 Note observations about diction. The first thing that hits you in the preceding essay is
the formality; Stephen discusses “Mr. Buckle,” not simply “Buckle.” And a first name is
never mentioned. You probably noticed that some words are unusual, such as “fêted”
and “vexed.” However, many of the words also are quite simple. For example, Buckle
“had his share of all this” and had “time just to sketch the outlines of his philosophy.”
The mixture of commonplace and unusual words implies complexity; therefore, the
ideas here may not be as straightforward as they seem.
In this particular passage, you need to dig a bit deeper into the diction to grasp
Stephen’s subtle message. Time “is stolen,” not “taken up by” or “spent on.” The impli-
cation is that the time belonged to the man who did something remarkable, and “idle
businesses” committed a crime. The word “idle” tells you that “breakfasts, dinners,
societies” are a waste of time. The word “businesses” as Stephen uses it here suggests
“keeping busy,” not “making money.”
Take a look at the description of Buckle’s illness and death. As you can see, even when
mortally ill, he’s still in work mode. Buckle was “compelled” to leave his work “uncom-
pleted,” and he died “thinking only of the thing which he had undertaken to do.” The
word “compelled” here is a strong one. Imagine that sentence without it: Buckle was
“vexed only that he left it [the work] uncompleted.” In this alternate version, Buckle is
less attached to his work. With “compelled” in the sentence, the reader senses that
Buckle was wrenched forcibly from his book.
 Examine the syntax of the passage. The second sentence of the passage contains two
lists. This structure emphasizes the disadvantages that come with fame. The passage
also includes many he/verb combinations: “He is feasted . . . He had scarcely won . . .
He had but time . . . he passed . . . he appeared . . . He went abroad . . . He died . . . He
went away . . . he had undertaken.” This repetitive sentence structure places the focus
on Buckle’s actions; it helps you focus on what he did and not on what he was. The
syntax of the last sentence reiterates this idea by ending with the word “do.”
Other, subtle syntactical touches reinforce Stephen’s idea about “man” and “his work.”
Most of the sentences in this essay are quite long. The long sentences give a sense of
urgency; the reader has few places to stop and catch a breath. In the same way, Buckle
was driven by an urgent desire to complete his work.
 Consider the author’s tone. When you put diction and syntax together, what do you
get? The author’s tone, of course! In this passage, the tone is complicated, as are the
sentences (syntax) and the vocabulary (a mix of ordinary and unusual words). The
overall tone is approving, but before you settle on that verdict, check out the last sen-
tence. Buckle “went away as he had lived, nobly careless of himself.” The word “nobly”
implies approval, but a hint of disapproval remains. True, Buckle had “more dangerous
enemies,” such as too great a devotion to his work. Stephen trivializes the illness at
Damascus; after all, overwork, not an illness, was the true cause of Buckle’s death.
However, society’s tendency to celebrate great work (those “idle businesses of a thou-
sand kinds”) and Buckle’s participation in that tendency played a role in his early
death and his failure to complete “that which he had undertaken to do.” In other
words, here’s the disapproval: Buckle didn’t fulfill his commitment.

Chapter 10: . . . And Nothing but the Truth: Reading Nonfiction Passages

 Pay attention to figurative language. No, I’m not talking about language that describes
figures — slender, athletic, bikini-challenged. I’m talking about the imaginative figures of
speech that spice up writing: personification, metaphor, hyperbole, and so forth. I go
into this topic in greater detail in Chapter 4, because figurative language is plastered all
over poetry. However, plenty of figurative language shows up in nonfiction too. In fact,
it’s a favorite AP exam topic, so be on the lookout when you’re reading nonfiction.
Here are a couple of examples, drawn from a variety of authors:
• Metaphor: “[Woman] was created to be the toy of man, his rattle, and it must
jingle in his ears, whenever, dismissing reason, he chooses to be amused.” (Mary
Wollstonecraft)
• Simile: “[The slave’s] going out into the world [being sold], is like a living man
going into the tomb, who, with open eyes, sees himself buried out of sight and
hearing of wife, children and friends of kindred tie.” (Frederick Douglass)
• Personification: “Nature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her works,
and delights in startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected quarters.”
(Ralph Waldo Emerson)
Once in a Lifetime: Memoir and Biography
Everybody has a life, and therefore we all have lots to write about. (Okay, I admit that some
folks’ lives are more interesting than others.) And because we all have stuff to write about,
that’s how we get biographies, memoirs, and autobiographies. A biography is about someone
else, and a memoir or autobiography is about the author. All of these occasionally provide 
AP material.
As with all nonfiction, you’re searching for structure and style, and you want to relate those
elements to meaning. You should also pay extra attention to the details that the author
includes and those that he or she omits. The following sections guide you in these tasks.
Clocks and calendars: Chronological structure
Biography and memoir usually punch a time clock, and you should always keep your eye on
the clock or calendar when you’re reading one of these selections. Every deviation from
strict chronological order has meaning. Chronological structure comes in the following 
varieties:
 Strict chronological order: The most obvious and therefore most common way to
structure a life story is to start at the beginning, move through the middle, and then 
hit the end. For example: I was born, I lived and did some things along the way, and then
I died.
Because AP-exam excerpts are just that — excerpts — you obviously won’t see the
whole thing. But you should be able to tell more or less where you are in someone’s
life. Furthermore, within the excerpt you normally see straight chronological order.
 Flashback: AP passages are generally too short for fully developed flashbacks, but you
may find one. More likely to appear are brief references to earlier events — just a sen-
tence or two about the past plopped into the story. For example: An equally horrible
thing happened to my neighbor’s dog once. He got attacked by a cat and then he fell in the
neighborhood hot tub. But anyway, now back to my original story. However, remember
that the essayist won’t be so blunt as to say “Now back to my original story.” The exam
passages shift time frames more subtly.
146
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

 Flash-forward: Lots of memoirs are written from the point of view of an older person
reflecting on his or her life. As older writers look back, they tend to evaluate earlier
events. Sometimes this “now I get it” point of view leads the writer to explain, out of
order, what happened after the life-changing event. In other words, the writer moves
forward in time for a bit and then returns to the main narrative. For example: So I was
elected Dog-Catcher-in-Chief, a position which led, fifty years later, to my being named
“Cat-Napper-in-Chief.”
When you encounter a passage from a memoir or a biography, follow these steps:
1. Construct a timeline of the events described in the passage.
Insert information that’s stated and add what you infer. However, don’t waste time
actually writing or drawing the timeline; just keep it in your head or jot down a couple
of words to remind you what happened when.
2. Consider the order of events.
Authors move things out of sequence on purpose. If you find a flashback or a flash-for-
ward, analyze the effect on the story. A flashback may deepen your knowledge of the
motivations or experiences of the subject. A flash-forward may create a tone of irony or
a sense of inevitability.
Here’s a bit from Frederick Douglass’s autobiography that begins when the slave owner dies.
Douglass, along with other slaves, is waiting to hear his fate. Read the passage, make a time-
line, and then decide why some of the events are out of chronological order:
In contemplating the likelihoods and possibilities of our circumstances, I probably suf-
fered more than most of my fellow servants. I had known what it was to experience kind,
and even tender treatment; they had known nothing of the sort. Life, to them, had been
rough and thorny, as well as dark. They had — most of them — lived on my old master’s
farm in Tuckahoe, and had felt the reign of Mr. Plummer’s rule. The overseer had written
his character on the living parchment of most of their backs, and left them callous; my
back (thanks to my early removal from the plantation to Baltimore) was yet tender. I had
left a kind mistress at Baltimore, who was almost a mother to me. She was in tears when
we parted, and the probabilities of ever seeing her again, trembling in the balance as
they did, could not be viewed without alarm and agony. The thought of leaving that kind
mistress forever, and, worse still, of being the slave of Andrew Anthony — a man who,
but a few days before the division of the property, had, in my presence, seized my
brother Perry by the throat, dashed him on the ground, and with the heel of his boot
stamped him on the head, until the blood gushed from his nose and ears — was terrible!
This fiendish proceeding had no better apology than the fact, that Perry had gone to
play, when Master Andrew wanted him for some trifling service. This cruelty, too, was of
a piece with his general character. After inflicting his heavy blows on my brother, on
observing me looking at him with intense astonishment, he said, “That is the way I will
serve you, one of these days;” meaning, no doubt, when I should come into his posses-
sion. This threat, the reader may well suppose, was not very tranquilizing to my feelings.
I could see that he really thirsted to get hold of me. But I was there only for a few days. I
had not received any orders, and had violated none, and there was, therefore, no excuse
for flogging me.
At last, the anxiety and suspense were ended; and they ended, thanks to a kind
Providence, in accordance with my wishes. I fell to the portion of Mrs. Lucretia — the
dear lady who bound up my head, when the savage Aunt Katy was adding to my suffer-
ings her bitterest maledictions.
Capt. Thomas Auld and Mrs. Lucretia at once decided on my return to Baltimore. They
knew how sincerely and warmly Mrs. Hugh Auld was attached to me, and how delighted
Mr. Hugh’s son would be to have me back; and, withal, having no immediate use for one
so young, they willingly let me off to Baltimore.
I need not stop here to narrate my joy on returning to Baltimore.
147
Chapter 10: . . . And Nothing but the Truth: Reading Nonfiction Passages

The passage begins with a moment in the “present” during which Douglass is thinking about
the future that awaits him and his fellow slaves. Douglass describes several events that hap-
pened before that moment and a few that happened after. The following events occurred
prior to the “present moment” in the passage:
 Douglass experienced “kind . . . treatment.” He wasn’t whipped. He left “a kind mistress
at Baltimore.”
 Douglass visited the home of Andrew Anthony. During this visit, Anthony wanted some
small service from Perry (who had been out playing), and Anthony “stamped” on
Perry’s head because the boy wasn’t immediately available.
 Anthony told Douglass that the same thing would happen to Douglass “one of these
days.”
 Douglass left Anthony’s home and returned to the “kind mistress.”
 At some time (not specified), “savage Aunt Katy” hurt Douglass’s head and 
“Mrs. Lucretia” dressed the wound.
 Other slaves lived in Tuckahoe with a cruel overseer who whipped them.
Now that you’ve defined the past, turn to the future. The following events occurred after the
“present moment” in the passage:
 The decision on Douglass is made: He goes to Mrs. Lucretia.
 Mrs. Lucretia and Thomas Auld decide that Douglass should return to Baltimore.
 Douglass returns to Baltimore.
Getting the timeline is fairly easy, but figuring out its significance is a bit tougher. However,
it’s certainly possible to determine the significance of a time change if you think about why
Douglass inserted these specific events from the past, just at the moment when he’s contem-
plating the future. For instance, you may have noticed that nearly everything Douglass men-
tions is terrible: He’s thinking about the hard lives of other slaves, whose backs are
“parchment” and are written on with scars from a slavemaster’s whip. He’s thinking about
Perry, who was “stamped” in the head simply for playing. He remembers Anthony’s threat
during Douglass’s brief time with Anthony. All these references deepen the reader’s sense of
Douglass’s peril. His relative happiness with a “kind mistress” could be transformed into a
nightmare. The events that Douglass reports stress the horrible possibilities that Douglass
faces. The events that follow the flashback feel like a reprieve, but the reader and Douglass
know that nothing is certain or permanent for a slave — exactly the point that Douglass
emphasizes with this structure.
Rhetorical techniques
The points about diction, syntax, and tone in essays (which I discuss earlier in this chapter)
hold true for memoir and biography as well. However, when you’re reading an excerpt from
someone’s life story, you have to check for another element of style: how the information is
conveyed. Here are some things to look for, each with an example:
 Direct statements by the subject about the subject: Most people describe themselves
when they’re writing a memoir, and biographers often quote the subject they’re writing
about. For example: I’m very musical, though my musical education was cut short the day
I threw my violin out of the window after my teacher instructed me to play the same piece
yet again. (The person quoted may believe that he or she is speaking only of music, but
the reader easily gleans the fact that the speaker has a problem with authority.) Look
for these statements, and take care to evaluate them. You may see qualities that the
writer didn’t mean to reveal. This extra information helps you understand the person
who’s the subject of the memoir or biography.
148
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

 Quoted statements from others about the subject: As you can imagine, it’s also impor-
tant to evaluate what other people say about the subject of a memoir or biography. For
example: He was always concerned about my welfare. That push in front of the bus was a
complete accident. Honestly!
 Summary and narrative: Every author has a ton of material to choose from when writ-
ing a life story. Thus the choices are important. What’s glossed over quickly? What gets
full detail (dialogue, action, description)? Even in a short AP passage, you still see
some of each. For example: Mort never shopped at the same place twice, except for the
hot day in June when . . . This sort of sentence signals that “the hot day in June” is par-
ticularly important, either because it breaks Mort’s pattern or because of some event
that occurred then. Either way, you know that “the hot day in June” has significance.
The proportion of summary to narrative and the events the author emphasizes slant
the work in a particular direction. After you know the slant, you can easily grasp the
author’s purpose.
When you’re reading memoir or biography, keep these questions in mind:
 Who’s telling you the story? If you know who’s talking, you know how to evaluate the
information. For example, if a fired employee is talking, you can assume that at least
some of the information may be influenced by whatever bitterness accompanied the
employee’s exit.
 How’s the story told? Summary, narrative, dialogue, and thoughts all have different
effects on the reader. For example, summary glosses over long periods of time, but nar-
rative nails your attention to one specific scene. You can assume that the scene is cru-
cial to the life story you’re reading.
 Where’s the emphasis? Some ideas or events get more attention than others. Why?
The answer to that little question tells you a lot about the author, the subject, and the
author’s attitude.
 Which details stand out? If you know very little about the subject of the memoir other
than the fact that his parakeet flew away, chances are that the parakeet is pretty gosh
darn important. So examine the parakeet to determine its significance.
Read the following passage from Frederick Douglass and consider what’s summarized and
what’s described in detail. Then think about the author’s reasons for these style choices:
Now all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands of strangers —
strangers who had nothing to do in accumulating it. Not a slave was left free. All
remained slaves, from youngest to oldest. If any one thing in my experience, more than
another, served to deepen my conviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill
me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor
old grandmother. She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age. She
had been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she
had become a great-grandmother in his service. She had rocked him in infancy, attended
him in childhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow the
cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was nevertheless left a slave — a
slave for life — a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands she saw her chil-
dren, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep, with-
out being gratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her own
destiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my
grandmother, who was now very old, having outlived my old master and all his children,
having seen the beginning and end of all of them, and her present owners finding she
was of but little value, her frame already racked with the pains of old age, and complete
helplessness fast stealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built
her a little hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege
of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die!
149
Chapter 10: . . . And Nothing but the Truth: Reading Nonfiction Passages

The advantages the slave owner and his family received from the author’s grandmother are
summarized. For instance, he notes her cradle-to-grave service to the slave owner and the
children she gave birth to and their descendents (all “property” of the slave owner and thus
an increase in his wealth). The family’s treatment of the grandmother, on the other hand, is
given much more detail. You hear of “her frame racked with the pains of old age,” “her once
active limbs” that can’t function well now, and her “little hut” in the woods. Douglass even
includes the fact that the chimney was made of mud. The effect of this division of summary
and narrative is to focus on the ill-treatment the grandmother received and her virtual aban-
donment by the family she had served.

Conquering Multiple-Choice Prose 
and Drama Questions
In This Chapter
 Surveying multiple-choice prose and drama questions
 Creating a strategy for each type of question
S
ometime in elementary school, you probably opened a book and encountered an
intriguing story, interesting characters, and a stirring climax. But just as your imagina-
tion went into high gear — wham! — down came a worksheet. There went the fun.
If I’ve described your experience, I’d like to apologize on behalf of every single teacher in the
entire world, including myself. And if the educational establishment hasn’t yet succeeded in
ruining good books for you, I’m hopeful that the AP English Literature and Composition
exam, which in part resembles a giant worksheet, won’t do so either. Regardless, keep in
mind that on the exam, you should be thinking about strategy, not the beauty or wisdom of
the works that you read. (However, those last two qualities are, I believe, what you get from
literature in its natural, untested state.) This chapter focuses on effective approaches to the
most common types of AP multiple-choice prose and drama questions, which fall into two
broad categories: what the passage means and how the passage is constructed.
You may notice that the terminology that’s in this chapter matches the terminology in
Chapter 6. However, questions about literary technique in poetry differ from questions about
prose or drama technique. Poetry questions tend to query how literary devices uncover
meaning, whereas prose and drama questions tend to focus on the effects that the writer
achieves by using various techniques. Don’t skip a section here just because you read about
the same technique in Chapter 6!
Attacking a Prose or Drama Passage: 
A Quick How-To
The AP exam is a war, and every multiple-choice passage is a different battle. Your army of
brain cells needs orders. Here’s your plan of attack:
1. Read the entire passage quickly.
Don’t underline or take notes the first time, because frankly, you probably won’t know
on the first read-through what’s important and what isn’t.
If you read the passage once and find that you’re totally at sea, don’t give up the ship.
The wisest course may be to skip the whole passage. Later, if you have time, you can
paddle back and have another go at it. But if you skip the section, be sure to slot your
remaining answers into the right line of ovals.

2. After the first read-through, skim the questions.
Don’t read all the choices; just get a general idea of what they want to know.
3. Read the passage again, but this time more slowly.
Annotate the passage as you read. Underline a couple of phrases that stand out or
impress you. Jot down words in the margin, identifying what’s going on in that para-
graph (“conflict with Katy,” for example) or ideas that occur to you (“theme = loneli-
ness” perhaps). You won’t have time to write much, but those few words will help you
with the whole question set.
The most common mistake is to underline and write too much, not too little. Keep it
short! (For more help with annotation, see Chapter 3.)
4. Begin to answer the questions.
Every question — both easy and difficult — is worth one point. If a question stumps 
you, circle it in the question booklet and move on. Return later to anything that 
puzzled you.
Testing Your Observation: Basic Reading
Comprehension Questions
Quite a few multiple-choice questions based on prose and drama passages measure basic
reading comprehension skills and vocabulary. You’ve probably been answering this sort of
question for years. Before you breathe a sigh of relief, however, remember that AP selections
tend to be tough compared to the ones you may have seen on other standardized tests. To
discover the best strategy for each type of question, read on.
Pointing out the “obvious”: Literal questions
Gleaning information from an AP prose or drama selection has one huge advantage: You
don’t have to search for or remember the facts. Being the merciful people that they are, the
exam writers even supply line numbers with most questions. When you’re facing a question
about Roger’s flight from home, for example, you don’t have to comb the passage looking for
the spot describing his departure. Instead, the question says something like “Roger leaves
(line 44) because . . .”
Sadly, the exam writers’ compassion has limits; for instance, they don’t tell you which line
contains the reason Roger went out for the newspaper one morning and didn’t return until 
20 years had elapsed. Roger’s motive may appear in line 12 or in line 51 — or nowhere, in
which case you have to infer the answer. (Later in this chapter, I explain more about beefing
up your inference skills.)
Paying attention to straightforward facts
Some (though admittedly not many) AP questions stay on the surface. The key to answering
straightforward factual questions is to examine the entire sentence or paragraph referred to
in the question. You may even need to review more of the text if the answer isn’t obvious.
The question may address the setting or the personality of a particular character or a similar
issue. You may be asked to clarify the meaning of something in the paragraph.
It’s time to test-drive a simple fact question. Read this passage and answer the question that
follows it:
152
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

There was until last winter a doorway in Chatham Square, that of the old Barnum cloth-
ing store, which I could never pass without recalling those nights of hopeless misery
with the policeman’s periodic “Get up there! Move on!” reinforced by a prod of his club
or the toe of his boot. I slept there, or tried to when crowded out of the tenements in the
Bend by their utter nastiness. Cold and wet weather had set in, and a linen duster was
all that covered my back. There was a woolen blanket in my trunk which I had from
home — the one, my mother had told me, in which I was wrapped when I was born; but
the trunk was in the “hotel” as security for money I owed for board, and I asked for it in
vain. I was now too shabby to get work, even if there had been any to get. I had letters
still to friends of my family in New York who might have helped me, but hunger and
want had not conquered my pride. I would come to them, if at all, as their equal, and,
lest I fall into temptation, I destroyed the letters. So, having burned my bridges behind
me, I was finally and utterly alone in the city, with the winter approaching and every
shivering night in the streets reminding me that a time was rapidly coming when such a
life as I led could no longer be endured.
According to the narrator, the “tenements in the Bend” (lines 4-5) are
(A) where he keeps a special woolen blanket
(B) in terrible condition
(C) overpopulated
(D) likely to turn him away
(E) located near Chatham Square
As you know, the question helpfully points you to lines 4-5. Reread lines 4 and 5. The 
narrator sleeps in the doorway when he’s “crowded out of the tenements in the Bend by
their utter nastiness.” The nastiness isn’t described, but you do know that the doorway is
cold, wet, and public. Plus, the police aren’t exactly sleeper-friendly. Hence, the tenements
must be even worse. They must be “in terrible condition,” so choice (B) is the one you’re
looking for.
A favorite trick of the AP exam writers is to supply a wrong answer that snags test takers
who read only part of a passage. In the preceding question, for example, the narrator says
that he sleeps in the doorway when “crowded out of the tenements in the Bend” (lines 4–5).
If you stop reading at that point, you think “too many people,” so you end up opening door
(C). And by choosing that answer, you lose a quarter point because the narrator is “crowded
out . . . by their utter nastiness” (lines 4-5). In other words, the conditions “crowded” him
out, not the number of people.
Practicing the process of elimination: What’s missing?
Another type of question zeroes in on what’s absent from the passage rather than what’s
present. To help you, AP exam writers capitalize the crucial word. For example, look for key
phrases such as “all of the following EXCEPT . . .” or “reasons for Roger’s flight do NOT
include . . .”. The best approach to this question is the process of elimination. Cross off
everything that is included and bingo, you’ve got the answer. 
Here’s a sample question based on an excerpt from Susan Glaspell’s play Trifles. In this
scene, two women are in the kitchen of the Wright home. Mr. Wright was murdered, and his
wife is a suspect. Read this passage, and then answer the question that follows:
153
Chapter 11: Conquering Multiple-Choice Prose and Drama Questions
(01)
(05)
(10)
(15)

MRS. HALE — [examining the skirt] Wright was close. I think maybe that’s why she kept
so much to herself. She didn’t even belong to the Ladies Aid. I suppose she felt she
couldn’t do her part, and then you don’t enjoy things when you feel shabby. She used to
wear pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster, one of the town girls
singing in the choir. But that — oh, that was thirty years ago. This all you was to take in?
MRS. PETERS — She said she wanted an apron. Funny thing to want, for there isn’t much
to get you dirty in jail, goodness knows. But I suppose just to make her feel more natu-
ral. She said they was in the top drawer in this cupboard. Yes, here. And then her little
shawl that always hung behind the door. [opens stair door and looks] Yes, here it is.
[quickly shuts door leading upstairs.]
MRS. HALE — [abruptly moving toward her] Mrs. Peters?
MRS. PETERS — Yes, Mrs. Hale?
MRS. HALE — Do you think she did it?
MRS. PETERS — [in a frightened voice] Oh, I don’t know.
MRS. HALE — Well, I don’t think she did. Asking for an apron and her little shawl.
Worrying about her fruit.
MRS. PETERS — [starts to speak, glances up, where footsteps are heard in the room
above. In a low voice] Mr. Peters says it looks bad for her. Mr. Henderson is awful sarcas-
tic in a speech and he’ll make fun of her sayin’ she didn’t wake up.
MRS. HALE — Well, I guess John Wright didn’t wake when they was slipping that rope
under his neck.
Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters know all of the following EXCEPT
(A) Mr. Wright’s attitude toward money
(B) Mrs. Wright’s social life
(C) the identity of Mrs. Wright’s lawyer
(D) the murder method
(E) Mrs. Wright’s habits prior to marriage
Let the cross-out process begin! Line 3 tells you that Mrs. Wright “couldn’t do her part” in the
local “Ladies Aid” (line 2) and probably felt “shabby” (line 3). Line 1 explains that Mr. Wright
was “close”; he didn’t like to spend money. Therefore, you can cross out (A). The same
speech tells you that Mrs. Wright “kept so much to herself” (lines 1–2) and that “when she
was Minnie Foster” (line 4), she wore “pretty clothes” (line 4) and was “lively” (line 4). Now
you can rule out (B) and (E). The last comment by Mrs. Hale (lines 20–21) indicates that Mr.
Wright was strangled. Now you can eliminate choice (D). The only choice left is (C). You can
infer the identity of the prosecutor from lines 18–19, but no information about her lawyer
appears in the passage. Thus choice (C) is your answer.
Understanding vocabulary in context
If you’re taking an AP English Lit course (and even if you aren’t), you probably have a good
stock of words in your vocabulary. However, vocabulary-in-context questions may still stump
you if you ignore the “in-context” part of the question. The exam writers like to choose a
simple word used in an unusual way, and then they list all the ordinary meanings as options.
Pretty evil, huh? Don’t worry. Your strategy is simple:
1. Read the sentence in which the word appears.
As best as you can, figure out what the sentence says. If it’s a tough sentence, restate it
in your own words.
154
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 
(01)
(05)
(10)
(15)
(20)

2. Look for clues that signal the meaning of the word.
Suppose I tell you that at the grocery store I bought “oranges, melons, and other globu-
lar fruit.” You may not be familiar with the word “globular,” but you know that oranges
and melons are shaped like balls. (You may also detect a resemblance to the word
“globe.”) Now you have a clue (or two).
3. Insert a possible synonym into the sentence.
For instance, in your head say, “I bought oranges, melons, and other ball-shaped fruit.”
4. Find a matching choice within the list of answers.
“Ball-shaped” may not appear, but you may find “round” or something similar.
Some “vocabulary” questions actually test your ability to interpret figurative language
(metaphors, symbols, and so forth). When you answer a question about the meaning of a
particular word or phrase, consider this level of meaning as well as the literal level of mean-
ing. (For help with figurative language, check out Chapter 4, which reviews figurative lan-
guage in poetry. Figurative language appears most often in poetry, but it can show up in
prose and drama too.)
Now you can try your hand at a vocabulary-in-context question. Refer to the preceding pas-
sage from Trifles (see the earlier section “Practicing the process of elimination: What’s miss-
ing?”) to answer this question. Reread the passage and then answer the following question.
In the context of line 1, “close” may be defined as
(A) near
(B) intimate
(C) aware
(D) shut
(E) miserly
“Close” may be defined in general by (A), (B), (D), and (E). Stretching the point a bit, even
choice (C) can define “close” if the context is “close to understanding.” However, the sen-
tences following the word “close” talk about Mrs. Wright’s inability to spend money. You can
substitute “tightwad,” “penny-pincher,” or something similar. Check out the five choices, and
you see that (E) is the answer that fits the context.
Matching twin to twin: Equivalent statements
Another “more-fun-than-a-barrel-of-piranhas” question asks you to find something in the pas-
sage that says exactly the same thing as another part of the passage. When seeking out these
types of questions, look for expressions such as “the same meaning is expressed by” or
“states a similar sentiment.” Your approach with these questions is simple:
1. Go back to the passage and read the line referred to in the question.
2. Restate it in your own words.
3. Check each of the choices offered.
4. As soon as you find one that’s a good match, darken the oval and move on.
Read this passage and answer the question following it:

Chapter 11: Conquering Multiple-Choice Prose and Drama Questions

Square and triangular houses are not allowed, and for this reason. The angles of a
Square (and still more those of an equilateral Triangle,) being much more pointed than
those of a Pentagon, and the lines of inanimate objects (such as houses) being dimmer
than the lines of Men and Women, it follows that there is no little danger lest the points
of a square or of a triangular house might do serious injury to an inconsiderate or per-
haps absentminded traveler suddenly running against them; and therefore, as early as
the eleventh century of our era, triangular houses were universally forbidden by Law,
the only exceptions being fortifications, powder-magazines, barracks, and other state
buildings, which is not desirable that the general public should approach without 
circumspection.
At this period, square houses were still everywhere permitted, though discouraged 
by a special tax. But, about three centuries afterwards, the Law decided that in all towns
containing a population above ten thousand, the angle of a Pentagon was the smallest
house-angle that could be allowed consistently with the public safety.
Which statement most closely expresses the same idea as “there is no little danger lest the
points of a square or of a triangular house might do serious injury” (lines 4–5)?
(A) Square and triangular houses are not allowed (line 1)
(B) [T]riangular houses were universally forbidden (line 7)
(C) [T]he only exceptions being fortifications (line 8)
(D) [T]he general public should approach without circumspection (line 9–10)
(E) [T]he angle of a Pentagon was the smallest house-angle that could be allowed consis-
tently with public safety (lines 13–14)
This passage speaks of the danger of running into sharp angles, such as those of triangles
and squares. A triangle has three corners, a square four. The next shape has to be a penta-
gon, which has five corners. The statement in the question says that the triangle and the
square are dangerous. The pentagon is therefore “the smallest house-angle that could be
allowed” safely, which means the statement in (E) is correct.
Say again? Interpretation questions
Oh, if interpretation questions were only as simple as moving from one language to another.
¡Sí, sí! (Sorry. I got carried away. That’s just Spanish for “Yes, yes!”) To interpret an AP English
Lit passage is a bit complicated, but it isn’t impossible.
Identifying the main idea
Main-idea questions may cover the entire passage or a portion of the passage (one para-
graph, perhaps). The question may be worded in several ways:
 The passage as a whole indicates . . . The key words in this question are “as a whole.”
If you choose an answer that applies to only one paragraph, you’re going to come up
with the wrong answer.
 Taken as a whole, the passage is . . . The answers here may fall into several categories.
You may see five terms that refer to how the passage is written (more on technique
appears later in this chapter) or five words that refer to content (an apology, a request,
a rebuttal, and so forth).
 The main idea asserted in lines 12–23 is . . . Be careful with the line numbers. Choose
an answer that fits only that portion of the passage.

When you’re answering a main-idea question, imagine an umbrella. The umbrella must be
large enough to ensure that your shoulders don’t get soaked, but not so large that you put
someone’s eye out with a spoke. Similarly, the main-idea statement must cover all the crucial
points in the designated passage, but it can’t be so broad that it covers everything in the
printed universe. The best strategy for a main-idea question is a simple one: Imagine a title
for the designated lines. Check your imagined title for fit. Is it too tight (doesn’t cover impor-
tant ideas), too loose (goes way beyond the passage), or just right? Then look at the answers
for one that matches your title.
A variation of the usual main-idea question asks for a word that sums up a situation or a
character. To answer this sort of question, follow the umbrella method, but concentrate only
on the designated situation or character.
Practice makes perfect, so have a go at this main-idea question, which is based on the follow-
ing excerpt. The narrator of this passage is named Aronnax.
My two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet, and were soon sound
asleep. For my own part, too many thoughts crowded my brain, too many insoluble
questions pressed upon me, too many fancies kept my eyes half open. Where were we?
What strange power carried us on? I felt — or rather fancied I felt — the machine sinking
down to the lowest beds of the sea. Dreadful nightmares beset me; I saw in these myste-
rious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this submarine boat seemed
to be of the same kind, living, moving, and formidable as they. Then my brain grew
calmer, my imagination wandered into vague unconsciousness, and I soon fell into a
deep sleep.
Which of the following most closely expresses the main idea of lines 1–9?
(A) sinking under the sea
(B) worries about safety under the sea
(C) dreams of unknown animals
(D) ocean travel
(E) Arronax’s worries
This passage comes from Jules Verne’s sci-fi masterpiece, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
the Sea. The title of the novel, however, is too general for this passage; anyway, it’s not one of
the choices. Choice (E) expresses the “fancies” (lines 3–5) that worry Arronax when he’s
awake. It also covers the “nightmares” (lines 5–7) that hit him when he’s asleep. Line 1 also
relates to (E); the companions can sleep and Arronax can’t. The only lines left out of (E) are
the last two — when Arronax finally calms down and gets some rest — but they aren’t cru-
cial. Choices (A) and (C) are too narrow; (B) and (D) are too broad. Therefore, (E) is the cor-
rect answer.
Reading between the lines: Inference
Inference is what your brain does when it builds a bridge between what actually appears in
the passage and what’s probably true. Acting like Sherlock Holmes, you put on your detec-
tive hat and work from clues when you solve — er, answer — an inference question. For
example, if the passage features an irate parent, shards of glass, and a muddy baseball,
chances are someone was playing baseball in a wet yard — and that someone who hit the
unfortunately aimed ball is probably now grounded for two weeks.
Inference questions show up in several different formats, including these:
 Lines 12–18 imply that . . . “Imply” is a fancy way to say “hint,” and hints are the foun-
dation on which inference rests.
 The description of sewing class suggests that . . . “Suggest” is another synonym for
“hint.”
157
Chapter 11: Conquering Multiple-Choice Prose and Drama Questions

 The sewing class probably meets frequently because . . . When you’re in “probably”
territory you’re rubbing shoulders with inference.
 The most likely reason Hilda drops a stitch is . . . “Most likely” means that you have
to stretch further than what the passage actually says.
 Hilda may have taken the class because . . . The verb “may” opens the door to inter-
pretation based on the passage. Not just any interpretation will do!
One type of inference question that shows up quite often asks you what probably precedes
or follows the excerpt on the exam. In this case, just imagine the excerpt in a larger context
and work from the clues, as you do with any other inference question.
The best approach to an inference question is to follow these steps:
1. Look for what’s actually stated in the selection.
2. Underline information that appears relevant, and then call on your knowledge of
human nature.
3. Rearrange the evidence from the passage until it fits a plausible theory.
When answering inference questions, take care not to extend yourself too far. Make a logical
step forward, not a long jump into imagination territory.
Check out this passage and take a stab at the inference question following it:
The superintendent of Lowood (for such was this lady) having taken her seat before a
pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her, and com-
menced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers:
repetitions in history, grammar, etc., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic suc-
ceeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls. The
duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The
superintendent rose. “I have a word to address to the pupils,” said she. The tumult of
cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice. She went on.
“You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry: I have
ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all.”
The teachers looked at her with a sort of surprise.
“It is to be done on my responsibility,” she added, in an explanatory tone to them, and
immediately afterwards left the room.
The reaction of the students and teachers to the superintendent indicates which of the 
following?
I. The students respect the superintendent.
II. Bread and cheese is a luxury at the school.
III. The teachers do not agree with the superintendent’s plan.
(A) All of the above
(B) None of the above
(C) I only
(D) I and II only
(E) III only

Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama

This passage comes from Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. The format of this question appears
from time to time on the AP exam. It’s no more difficult than any other format; just check the
validity of each statement and then choose the letter that corresponds to your opinion.
Statement I is easily inferred; the moment the superintendent begins to speak (line 7), the
“tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her voice.” Such
instant obedience indicates respect. Statement II is probably true because the teachers
“looked at her with a sort of surprise” (line 11) when the superintendent announced the
lunch menu. She explains that the menu “is to be done on my responsibility” (line 12). From
the surprise and the “I’ll-take the-blame” comment, you have to assume that the students
don’t usually get bread and cheese. It’s likely that such a meal is a luxury. Statement III goes a
little too far. After all, the teachers show “a sort of surprise” (line 11), but they don’t show
disapproval. Because I and II are correct, the best choice is (D).
Sizing up attitude and tone
A reputable site on the Internet lists 76 different tones that may be discerned in literature.
That’s a lot, but really I’m surprised that the number isn’t even higher. Tone, a term that may
be applied to the attitude of the author or characters, is a popular AP-exam topic. (Chapter 9
goes into more detail on tone in prose and drama.)
Approach a question on tone or attitude with these steps:
1. Read the question carefully, and be sure you know what it asks.
The attitude of the author or of a specific character may be quite different, and you can
be sure that the exam writers will include words that apply to both. In other words,
don’t answer the wrong question!
2. “Hear” the relevant portion of the passage in your head as you read.
Can you identify the emotions you hear? Does the passage sound playful or sad, sarcas-
tic or admiring, regretful or analytical?
3. Look closely at the words.
Does the diction (word choice) slant toward a particular attitude?
4. Check the content.
Can you imagine a fit between what’s being said and the tone you’ve selected? Jane
Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, for example, begins with a famous sentence: “It is a truth
universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a large fortune, must be
in want of a wife.” Can anyone say that sentence with a straight face? I don’t think so!
Clearly Austen’s tone here isn’t serious. If this sentence appeared in a tone question,
you’d look for “mocking” or a similar answer.
Test your attitude-detector by reading this passage and answering the tone question that 
follows:
There only remain an hundred and twenty thousand children of poor parents annually
born. The question therefore is, How this number shall be reared, and provided for?
which, as I have already said, under the present situation of affairs, is utterly impossible
by all the methods hitherto proposed. For we can neither employ them in handicraft or
agriculture; we neither build houses, (I mean in the country) nor cultivate land: they can
very seldom pick up a livelihood by stealing till they arrive at six years old; except where
they are of towardly parts, although I confess they learn the rudiments much earlier;
during which time they can however be properly looked upon only as probationers. . . . 
I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to
the least objection.
I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a
young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and whole-
some food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will
equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout.

The author’s tone may be described as
(A) ironic
(B) argumentative
(C) detached
(D) sincere
(E) sympathetic
This passage comes from Jonathan Swift’s famous work, “A Modest Proposal,” and is one of
the best examples of irony in English literature. You find irony when a gap yawns between
what the author or character says and what he or she means. In this excerpt, Swift pretends
to offer a solution to the problem of poverty in Ireland. His answer? The Irish should eat their
children. What?! You can’t get much more ironic that that! Look at the evidence. The first
paragraph explains that children can’t “pick up a livelihood by stealing” (line 6) until they’re
6 years old. For a moment, perhaps, you may think that Swift is serious. But only for a
moment, because as soon as you think a bit more, you know that theft will not be offered as a
serious career option. The next clue is the author’s declaration that he will now “humbly pro-
pose [his] thoughts” (line 9), which he hopes “will not be liable to the least objection” (lines
9–10). If the author actually intended to encourage cannibalism, he would have expected
some objections (okay, quite a lot of objections!). Obviously, the answer is (A).
Assessing the Role of Style and Technique
Writing a piece of literature is easy. As the great sportswriter Red Smith once said, “All you
have to do is sit down at a typewriter and open a vein.” (These days, of course, a computer
has replaced the typewriter.) Smith’s remark captures the emotional investment writers
make in their work, but it omits an important factor: technique.
Each page of prose represents hundreds of decisions. What should I put in? What should I
leave out? In what order should the information be presented? Should I use dialogue or
description? This word or that one? All these decisions add up to writing style or technique,
which are major categories tested by AP multiple-choice questions.
Identifying the author’s purpose 
in choosing elements of style
A slew of multiple-choice questions ask the purpose or effect of some lines or paragraphs.
And sometimes questions address the type of writing involved (dialogue, description,
thoughts, and so on). Look for questions resembling these:
 The description of the 
(lines 2–7) serves primarily to . . . In
other words, the exam writer wants you to think about why the author wants you to
know what the element identified in the blank looks like.

is quoted in line 4 in order to . . . Why not give the information
another way? What happens when the reader knows the exact words of the character
named in the blank?
 What is the function of paragraph 
? A variation of this question
asks about the “purpose” of the paragraph specified in the question.
160
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

To answer these types of questions, follow these steps:
1. Reread the portion of the passage referred to in the question.
Be sure you know what it says, and then determine what it is: description, dialogue,
argument, objection, and so forth.
2. Imagine a change in the passage.
Take out the designated lines or alter them in some other way. However, don’t take the
time to write down the alternate-universe passages you create. Just think about the
changes.
3. Determine how the passage is affected by the alteration.
After you know how the passage comes across in the alternate-universe version, you
know why the writer made the original choice. You know the purpose, the function, the
effect, and anything else the AP writers throw at you!
Rev up your brain, read this selection, and answer the question that follows:
FIRST LONGSHOREMAN — [Abruptly.] Let’s drink up and get back to it. [They finish
their drinks and go out left. The POSTMAN enters as they leave. He exchanges nods with
JOHNNY and throws a letter on the bar.]
THE POSTMAN — Addressed care of you, Johnny. Know him?
JOHNNY — [Picks up the letter, adjusting his spectacles. LARRY comes and peers over
his shoulders. JOHNNY reads very slowly.] Christopher Christopherson.
THE POSTMAN — [Helpfully.] Square-head name.
LARRY — Old Chris — that’s who.
JOHNNY — Oh, sure. I was forgetting Chris carried a hell of a name like that. Letters
come here for him sometimes before, I remember now. Long time ago, though.
THE POSTMAN — It’ll get him all right then?
JOHNNY — Sure thing. He comes here whenever he’s in port.
THE POSTMAN — [Turning to go.] Sailor, eh?
The postman’s conversation with Johnny serves to
(A) introduce the character “Christopher Christopherson”
(B) show that Johnny is unfamiliar with his customers
(C) create an atmosphere of uncertainty
(D) prepare the way for a confrontation between Larry and Johnny
(E) indicate the informality of the bar
This passage from Eugene O’Neill’s play Anna Christie gives quite a bit of data about Chris:
he’s a sailor, he received letters a “long time ago” (line 10), and he visits the bar when he’s in
port. The implication is that Chris has no fixed address on land and that he has few ties to
others, as the bar is his only point of contact. What a great, economical introduction to this
character. Choice (A), then, is the correct answer.

Pondering the order of events: Structure questions
Structure questions ask you to consider location — where everything is in the passage — and
why the author chose that order of events. Structure questions also require you to note
when something changes and, of course, what effect the change has on a reader’s perception
of the passage. Some common structure questions include the following:
 The passage as a whole moves from . . . The answers to this type of question will be
something like these: From description to narration? From present to past — and back?
From argument to resolution?
 The shift to first-person point of view (lines 8–10) . . . The exam writers love shifts —
changes in point of view, tone, and so forth. Sometimes they ask you to describe the
change (from happy to sad or from past to present, perhaps). Other times they want to
know the purpose or effect of a shift.
A variation of the “shift” question asks about juxtaposition, placing two things next to
each other. Why these two, and why together?
 The last paragraph (lines 50–66) primarily serves to . . . To answer this question cor-
rectly you need to think about why that paragraph is at the end of the passage. What
does it do in this position?
Solving structural puzzles is easy. Just follow these steps:
1. Take a close look at the designated lines.
What do they add to the passage? What do they accomplish?
2. Check out the lines or paragraphs before and after the designated lines.
Context is everything! Step back from the passage and consider the big picture.
3. Decide how the designated lines relate to neighboring paragraphs or lines.
Does the third paragraph, for example, serve as a bridge between the discussion of the
past (the second paragraph) and the future (the fourth paragraph)? Does it set the
scene for the dialogue that follows? Does it explain what happened after the events of
the second paragraph?
4. Look for a matching answer.
If you don’t find one that fits your theory, test out the answers provided. You may not
find an identical twin, but a second cousin may pop in for a visit.
Read this passage and answer the question following it:
There was even an ease and cheerfulness about her air and manner that I made no pre-
tension to; but there was a depth of malice in her too expressive eye that plainly told me
I was not forgiven; for, though she no longer hoped to win me to herself, she still hated
her rival, and evidently delighted to wreak her spite on me. On the other hand, Miss
Wilson was as affable and courteous as heart could wish, and though I was in no very
conversable humor myself, the two ladies between them managed to keep up a pretty
continuous fire of small talk. But Eliza took advantage of the first convenient pause to
ask if I had lately seen Mrs. Graham, in a tone of merely casual inquiry, but with a side-
long glance — intended to be playfully mischievous — really, brimful and running over
with malice.
“Not lately,” I replied, in a careless tone, but sternly repelling her odious glances with my
eyes; for I was vexed to feel the color mounting to my forehead, despite my strenuous
efforts to appear unmoved.
“What! Are you beginning to tire already? I thought so noble a creature would have
power to attach you for a year at least!”
“I would rather not speak of her now.”

Overall, the passage shifts from
(A) first to third person
(B) description to narration
(C) narration to dialogue
(D) action to narration
(E) conflict to resolution
This excerpt from Anne Bronte’s The Tenant of Wildfell Hall portrays a vicious fight that’s
conducted in the super-polite setting of a drawing room. The first paragraph summarizes
what’s going on — the attitude of the ladies, their motives, their methods of attack. Then the
fight begins. As this is a verbal, not a physical fight, the characters talk. There you have your
answer: The first paragraph is narration, (“here’s-what-happened” statements). Then the 
dialogue (characters’ speech) begins. Clearly, (C) is the best choice.
Questioning word choice and arrangement: 
Syntax questions
Syntax refers to the grammatical structure of a sentence. The AP English exam tests your
understanding of syntax in questions such as these:
 The introductory clauses (lines 2–6) act as . . . This kind of question names a gram-
matical element and asks you to figure out why the author chose that particular gram-
matical element.
 The repetition of 
in lines 12 and 55 suggests that . . . With this
question, the exam writers want to know why the author repeated this word. What’s
being tied together?
 The structure of the last sentence serves to . . . This question asks you to determine
why the sentence is put together in this particular way.
Questions about the sentence structure sometimes revolve around emphasis — what’s
stressed or what’s downplayed. Look for parts of the sentence that can stand alone,
and then look for parts that are dependent (incomplete ideas that rely on the rest of
the sentence in order to make sense). The stand-alone portions generally draw the
reader’s attention.
 In line 12, “that” refers to . . . This question addresses pronoun reference; it asks you
to determine what word a pronoun replaces. A variation of this question may look like
this: The antecedent of “that” (line 12) is . . .
If you’re grammar-challenged, don’t panic. Usually, syntax questions can be answered with-
out much knowledge of grammar terminology. The following steps should get you through
most syntax questions:
1. Reread the designated lines.
Be careful to focus on the portion that the exam writers are questioning you about.
2. With your best reading comprehension skills, determine what the lines mean.
Don’t worry about whether “that” is a pronoun, an adverb, an astronaut, or a water-
melon. Just figure out which other word in the paragraph “that” represents.
163
Chapter 11: Conquering Multiple-Choice Prose and Drama Questions

3. Restate the exam question in your own words.
The question “The introductory clauses (lines 2–6) act as . . .” would be reworded to
sound something like this: “What purpose do the introductory words serve?” The ques-
tion “The repetition of 
in lines 12 and 55 suggests that . . .” would
become “Why did he say 
two times?”
4. Answer the question in your own words, and look for a choice that comes close to
your own.
If nothing matches, test likely candidates from the five choices offered.
A syntax question — just what you need to complete your day! Answer the following ques-
tion after reading this bit of nonfiction, which may ring a (Liberty) bell:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,
Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are
instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That
whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of
the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its founda-
tion on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem
most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.
The successive clauses beginning with “that” serve to
(A) de-emphasize each individual clause
(B) create a sense of uncertainty
(C) stress logical reasoning
(D) prepare the way for more important ideas
(E) focus on the “Right of the People to . . . institute a new Government” (line 6)
This excerpt comes from the Declaration of Independence. You won’t find the Declaration on
the AP exam, but you may find similar syntax, and similar questions about syntax, in nonfic-
tion passages. The term, clause, is nice to know, but not crucial. (A clause, by the way, is a
subject-verb statement.) To answer this question, read the paragraph “aloud” in your inner
voice. Can you hear how each “that” goes back to the “truths” that are “self-evident” (line 1)?
No clause beginning with “that” stands alone; it’s dependent on another statement. Each
“that” clause adds a link to the chain of logic. That means (C) is the answer that you’re 
looking for.

W
riting an AP English Literature and Composition exam essay on a prose or drama
selection is both easier and harder than writing one in response to a poem. Most
people feel more comfortable with prose and drama selections than they do with poetry.
Plus, prose or drama passages are generally longer, and on first reading they appear to offer
more points to include in an essay. However, the length of the material may create a time
problem. You have to read the passage, gather ideas, and slide a polished essay into the
booklet in less than three quarters of an hour. The great thing about poems, on the other
hand, is that they’re short. (For more on poetry essays, see Chapter 7.)
In this chapter, I explain how to approach prose and drama passages and write about them
with ease and intelligence while under a time crunch.
Cracking Open the Essay Prompt
Like poetry prompts, prose and drama questions usually contain some standard elements.
Thus, you should read every word of an essay prompt and underline key words, because you
don’t want to risk missing something that you need to include. However, don’t waste pre-
cious seconds pondering the following phrases:
 “Read the passage below.” Yawn. How else can you write the essay? Often, the prompt
orders you to “read the passage carefully.” Good thing they reminded you not to skim.
 “In a well-written essay . . . ” I’m sure without this reminder you’d write a terrible
essay on purpose or skip around just to keep the grader guessing about what comes
next.
Also like poetry prompts, prose and drama prompts usually — but not always — specifically
ask you to relate meaning (what’s going on in the passage) to writing style (how the meaning
is conveyed). Aspects of meaning queried in prose and drama prompts include plot, conflict,
setting, characterization, attitude, purpose, and theme. The elements of style (which are also
known as “literary elements,” “literary devices,” or “stylistic devices,”) include dialogue,
description, diction, syntax, tone, point of view, selection of detail, and figurative language.
(Turn to Chapter 9 for a review of these prose and drama terms.) In short, these prompts ask
how technique conveys meaning/theme.

Even though you have a chance to see just about any of the preceding elements in an essay
prompt, a survey of the last two decades of prose and drama essay prompts shows that the
most commonly asked questions concern attitude and characterization. The exam writers
like to query you about a character’s attitude (especially if that character is the narrator) or
about a change in attitude. For instance, the attitude of the author toward his or her charac-
ters, the author’s viewpoint on a social or political issue, or the way an author views an event
have all made appearances on the AP English exam. 
Characterization — how a character is portrayed — pops up so often that I imagine the
College Board has a special computer command for it (control+A or F5 or something like
that). For example, the AP has asked about techniques that define so-and-so’s character, how
narrative techniques create characterization, and which literary techniques characterize
such-and-such a character. (For more on characterization, turn to Chapter 9.)
Even if a prose or drama essay prompt on your AP exam doesn’t mention literary technique,
you should incorporate references to style in your essay anyway. The graders expect you to
pick apart the passage and to read below the surface. If you’re asked about the characteriza-
tion of Emily, write about Emily’s characterization and then write about how you determined
Emily’s characterization.
This style portion of the question may be worded in many ways, including these:
 Analyze how point of view and diction affect . . . I used “point of view and diction”
here, but you may encounter any literary technique. And in some prompts, the word
“affect” may be replaced with “produce” or “reveal.” How does this question end? The
possibilities for prose and drama prompts are more varied than those for poetry, and
they depend on what’s in the passage. You may find a general category (“the comic
effect” or “the reader’s perception,” for example) or something more specific (perhaps
“the impact of the experience on Jamie” or “the dramatization of the conflict between
the father and the son”).
 Discuss how literary devices convey . . . The verb in this sort of prompt may also be
“analyze,” “consider,” or “discuss.” Also, “reveal” or “express” show up fairly often as
synonyms for “convey.” The prompt may ask how the stylistic devices convey an
event, a conflict, a relationship, an attitude, a comparison, the author’s purpose, or
something else. The key here is to comb through the passage with style in mind.
 Consider selection of detail, point of view, and other such elements . . . I’ve chosen
three elements of style for this sample prompt, but you may see two, four, or even
more than that. The important part of this prompt, however, isn’t the stylistic devices
mentioned (though you should pay extra attention to anything listed). Instead, the cru-
cial phrase is “other such elements,” which asks you to go beyond what the prompt
specifies.
The trend in recent AP English exams is toward more general questions that mention a
couple of literary elements plus “other techniques” or “similar literary devices.” When
the door is open in this way, don’t slam it shut and discuss only the one or two things
asked about in the prompt. The graders look kindly upon essays that discuss items not
mentioned in the question because variety is the spice of life — especially in lives that
are spent grading tons of papers that pretty much say the same thing.
It’s important to know upfront that AP prose and drama essay prompts sometimes break
from tradition. (Poetry prompts seldom bust loose. They’re more predictable than prose and
drama prompts.) One AP exam, for example, presented two versions of the same prose pas-
sage and asked for an essay commenting on the author’s reasons for revision. (That one
must have been fun to write.) Another prompt asked the test taker to explain how comic,
grotesque, and pathetic aspects of a selection were blended. (Also fun to write, I’m sure.)
Prompts have queried satirical effects and how they’re created, a heroine’s adventures 
and how they’re dramatized, and the relationship between narrative voice and social 
commentary.

If you get an unusual question, don’t panic. Chances are the graders will read your response
with an open mind. If you make a point and back it up with evidence from the selection, you
should be fine. Graders also look kindly upon those who know what they’re talking about
when they use literary terminology, and they’re checking to see whether you’ve really
thought about what you’re writing and have support for your assessment. (For more infor-
mation, see the later section “Choosing Your Evidence.”)
No matter what kind of prompt you face, follow the dissecting procedure I outline in Chap-
ter 3. In this procedure, you briefly underline key words in the prompt, restate the question
in your own words, and concentrate on what the exam writers want you to do.
Digesting the Passage and Deciding on a Focus
You read novels, stories, and plays all the time, but during the AP English exam, you have to
do more than just read. You have to chew up the passage and digest its contents, and you
have to work fast. (Then you have to spit it back, in new and improved form, onto the pink
answer booklet.)
Don’t even think about reading an essay passage until you’ve spent a couple of minutes
reviewing the prompt. Understanding the prompt allows you to read with purpose, to focus
on what you need to unearth from the passage.
You’re not required to write the essays in order. The best tactic, therefore, is to start with the
essay that’s easiest for you. If you’re a poetry fan, write about the poetry selection first. If
you spend half your life in the theater (and if your exam includes a drama passage), start
with the drama essay. Leave the most difficult essay for last.
Here’s a plan for reading prose and drama passages when the time clock is ticking:
1. Read and annotate right away.
When you first read a poem, you probably shouldn’t take notes because you’ll likely
need to use every available brain cell simply to decode the meaning. The surface mean-
ing of a prose or drama passage, on the other hand, is generally easier to grasp the first
time through. Just pick up a pen and underline as you read through the first time. Jot
down your notes in the margin. For instance, if you’re queried about a relationship
between two characters, note their interactions. If the question asks about the tech-
niques that create a comic effect, pay attention to every sentence that makes you
smile.
If you find yourself underlining too much or taking too many notes, you need to narrow
your focus. Suppose the prompt asks you to define the narrator’s attitude toward
Reverend Hilton and to discuss the literary devices that convey that attitude to the
reader. You begin to read, and every time the narrator says something about Reverend
Hilton, you underline the comment. The only problem with this tactic is that the entire
passage is narrated, and the whole thing is about Reverend Hilton. What do you do?
No, you don’t throw the booklet at the ceiling fan. You think about the available literary
devices. In fact, you may even make a list in the margin to help you remember what
you’re looking for: diction, syntax, figurative language, description, dialogue, and so
forth. Then you read the passage looking for those literary devices, noting each device
you find.
2. Read what you’ve underlined or noted.
By reading your initial notes, you can get an idea of what’s in the passage and which
parts relate to the essay that you have to write.
167
Chapter 12: Writing Stellar Essays on Prose and Drama Passages

3. Reread the passage.
Go through the whole thing again, but this time read more slowly. Add to your notes 
or underline anything useful, always keeping the prompt in mind. If you realize that
something you wrote the first time isn’t helpful, put a single vertical line through it.
However, don’t obliterate the text. You still want to be able to read what you wrote or
underlined, in case you later change your mind and decide it’s relevant after all.
Two readings ought to be enough. If at that point you still feel like you don’t have
enough to write about, consider going through the passage a third time. Timing, of
course, is the deciding factor here. The third read may be the charm. However, if you’re
a fairly slow reader and the clock is running faster than an Olympic sprinter, cut your
losses. Fashion the best essay possible from what you’ve gleaned so far. Or, hit another
essay and return to this one later. The short break may make all the difference.
4. Construct a thesis statement and subtopics and craft your introduction.
Your introduction should be a separate paragraph and must contain the title and
author of the passage (if you know these facts) and a thesis statement. Remember: The
title of a full-length work (a play or a novel) should be underlined. The title of a short
story is placed in quotation marks and not underlined. The thesis statement — the main
point you set out prove in the essay — is easy to create on the AP English exam. In fact,
usually all you have to do is restate the prompt, inserting specifics where the prompt
remains in general territory. (For a complete explanation of how to write a thesis state-
ment, turn to Chapter 3.)
168
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 
Putting your funny bone to the test
The common wisdom — Jane Austen’s “truth univer-
sally acknowledged” — is that the worst AP essays are
written about comedy. The theory is that English teach-
ers tend to overload their classes with tragedy, so test
takers are less prepared to read something lighter. If you
encounter a comic selection, loosen up as you read.
Allow the author’s sense of humor to reach you through
the fog of anxiety that permeates an AP test room. Then
look for all the things that make comedy. Here’s a list of
the most common comedy elements:
 Hyperbole: Hyperbole is a fancy term for overstate-
ment, such as American humorist Heywood Broun’s
comment that a censor “is a man who . . . believes
that he can hold back the mighty traffic of life with a
tin whistle and a raised right hand.”
 Understatement: Understatement is the opposite of
hyperbole, when you play down the importance,
size, or intensity of an event. Here’s an example from
Beowulf — an Old English hero versus monster
story with surprising touches of comedy: “The
[sword] was not useless to the warrior now.” In case
you haven’t read this story, the warrior is facing a
gruesome monster and definitely needs his sword.
 Incongruity: Incongruity occurs when something is
wildly out of place or weird things show up together.
For example, in James Thurber’s story, “The
Macbeth Murders,” an American tourist reads
Macbeth, the famous Shakespearean play, as if it
were a detective novel. She applies the usual detec-
tive-story methods to the play, and of course they
don’t fit at all. In this case, the incongruity creates
the humor. (She decides that Macbeth and his wife
were innocent because they appear to be guilty!)
 Irony: Irony arises from a gap between what is said
and what is meant. Consider Alexander Woollcott’s
comment on his childhood visits to the theater:
“[S]ome of our classmates not only avoided these
orgies, but sincerely believed that we, who indulged
in them, were simply courting Hell’s fire.” Woolcott,
a playwright, employs irony when he calls the shows
“orgies.”
Also look for witty dialogue, silly situations, and the like.
And smile! Not only will you feel better, you’ll write a
better essay too.

Consider two examples of effective introductions:
In this passage from Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, Lily is painting an
abstract portrait of Mrs. Ramsay and her son James. Through dialogue, Lily’s
thoughts, and the description of her painting, Lily’s attitude toward art becomes
clear.
Willy Loman, of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, is a quintessential tragic
hero. Much like a doomed character in a Greek tragedy, Willy slowly destroys his
career, his family, and eventually himself due to hubris over which he has no con-
trol: the infinite power of his crippling self-delusion.
The thesis statement in each of these examples is the last sentence of the paragraph. In
the first example, the thesis statement sets the stage for a discussion of Lily’s view of
art. In the second, the reader knows that the essay will analyze how Willy deludes him-
self. These introductions are short, but they accomplish their goals.
When my brain is fried and my inspiration has taken a vacation, physical activity often helps
me. You obviously can’t go for a bike ride during the AP exam, but you can drop your head
and roll it in a circle or wriggle your toes. (However, if you’re moving your head around, be
sure to keep your eyes closed. You don’t want to risk a cheating charge.) Even a minute’s
break may open a pathway through your head that originally had been blocked. Then you
can return to the problem essay and charge ahead.
Choosing Your Evidence
Much trickier than creating a thesis statement is selecting the best evidence. See yourself as
a literary crime scene investigator, with the passage as the murder site. When you’re working
on a poetry passage, nearly all your evidence takes the form of quotations from the poem,
because every word in a poem is dripping with meaning. However, prose and drama are dif-
ferent. The evidence for essays about these passages comes in two forms: non-quoted refer-
ences to the passage and quotations.
In most prose and drama selections, stuff happens. A story (or, more likely, a slice of a story)
is told. People converse or do things — wipe sweaty brows, throw shoes at each other, over-
throw the government, and so forth. Or, in a nonfiction passage, the writer strings together a
logical train of thought, taking the reader from problem to solution, from cause to effect,
from similarities to differences. The point is that prose and drama passages contain readily
identifiable content. Just to be clear: I’m not saying that poetry is content-free. Poetic con-
tent, however, is different. Poetry usually works on a more imaginative, thematic level. Prose
and drama passages, on the other hand, tend to give you more literal content to work with as
you write an essay.
Deciding whether to quote or summarize
When you’re writing about fiction or drama, the key to success is to avoid summarizing the
plot or quoting content unless you have a good reason to do so. The College Board frowns so
deeply on irrelevant plot summary that sometimes the prompt explicitly tells you to avoid it.
Similarly, when you’re writing about an essay or another nonfiction piece, don’t waste time
summarizing or quoting content unless doing so helps answer the question posed by the
prompt. The goal: Choose whatever supports your assertions and ignore the rest of the 
passage.
169
Chapter 12: Writing Stellar Essays on Prose and Drama Passages

If you’re describing a literary device (an element of style) and if you’re going to explore how
that device contributes to the piece, you should quote directly from the passage. However, at
times quotations aren’t important, and inserting them only slows you down. I explain specifi-
cally when and when not to quote in the following sections.
Knowing when you can get away without quoting
Keep these guidelines in mind when identifying what you don’t need to quote:
 It’s seldom worth the trouble to quote plot points. If a character shows up, you don’t
need a quotation giving that information — unless, of course, the diction (word choice)
affects the way you perceive the arrival. For instance, if the passage says, “Godfrey slid
into town” or “Godfrey stomped up Main Street,” a quotation is justified. The first sen-
tence sounds sneaky, and the second sounds aggressive. But don’t bother quoting,
“Godfrey came to town.” Just refer, if need be, to Godfrey’s arrival.
 You can often summarize dialogue, unless you want to make a point about diction
and syntax or characterization. Imagine this conversation, which is all too common in
the school lunchrooms of America: Mary declares, “I hate this food.” Her friend Sally
answers, “Me too.” You can state in your essay that Mary and her friend hate cafeteria
food without going into more detail. The exception, of course, is when even common-
place dialogue reveals character. If you’re writing about Mary’s domination of Sally, for
example, Sally’s response (“Me too”) may bolster your case.
 If you need background information for your essay, you can often summarize it.
Perhaps the passage tells you that Mary and Sally attend elementary school and that
they’re best friends. Unless the diction slants that information in a certain direction
(for example, “Mary and Sally had been stuck with each other since kindergarten” or
“Sally glued herself to Mary on the first day of kindergarten”), simply state the facts
and move on.
 If you’re writing about a nonfiction passage, you can sometimes paraphrase the
author’s arguments without quoting. As always, restate material only if it’s needed for
your essay, and quote whenever the exact words affect the reader’s perception.
Don’t quote simply to show that a particular literary element exists in the passage. The AP-
graders hate laundry lists and will likely downgrade you if they see one. Quote only words or
phrases that you’re going to interpret or analyze.
Take a look at this passage from “Over Tilly,” a story by F. Scott Fitzgerald (in it, Jim is also
known as “Jelly-bean”):
Clark took out his handkerchief and wiped his damp brow. “Reckon you’re not the only
one it shook up,” he admitted gloomily. “All this thing of girls going round like they do is
going to stop right quick. Too bad, too, but everybody’ll have to see it thataway.”
“Do you mean,” demanded Jim in surprise, “that all that’s leaked out?”
“Leaked out? How on earth could they keep it secret. It’ll be announced in the papers to-
night. Doctor Lamar’s got to save his name somehow.”
Jim put his hands on the sides of the car and tightened his long fingers on the metal. “Do
you mean Taylor investigated those checks?”
It was Clark’s turn to be surprised. “Haven’t you heard what happened?” Jim’s startled
eyes were answer enough. “Why,” announced Clark dramatically, “those four got another
bottle of corn, got tight and decided to shock the town — so Nancy and that fella Merritt
were married in Rockville at seven o’clock this morning.”
A tiny indentation appeared in the metal under the Jelly-bean’s fingers. “Married?”
“Sure enough. Nancy sobered up and rushed back into town, crying and frightened to
death — claimed it’d all been a mistake. First Doctor Lamar went wild and was going to
kill Merritt, but finally they got it patched up some way, and Nancy and Merritt went to
Savannah on the two-thirty train.”

Imagine that you’re writing in response to a prompt about the characterization of Jim. These
points can probably be mentioned in your essay without direct quotations:
 Any statement about Clark
 Jim’s surprise that information has leaked out
 His worry about the town’s finding out about the checks
 The tightening of Jim’s fingers on the metal of the car when he asks about the checks
 His learning of Nancy’s marriage in conversation with Clark
The fact that you aren’t quoting doesn’t give you license to make vague references to the 
passage. Specifics nearly always top generalities in literary essays. For example, write that
“Jim is surprised to hear of Nancy’s marriage” — not that “Jim is surprised at Clark’s news.”
Recognizing when quotations are essential
“Use a quotation!” That’s the neon sign that should blink on and off in your brain whenever
you face prompts about the following factors:
 Attitude: Attitude is a common AP topic. Because the author’s voice is heard most
directly there, quoting from the narrative portions of a prose piece (when no character
is speaking) is often the easiest way to establish the author’s attitude. You can also
quote from the playwright’s stage directions and character descriptions. When writing
about a character’s attitude, look closely at the dialogue and actions of the character
and quote relevant words.
 Characterization: Some characters are educated, and some aren’t. Some are angry, 
and others are elated. The way a character is described, the way he or she speaks, and
the comments others make about him or her may all be important enough to quote. In
the F. Scott Fitzgerald passage earlier in this chapter, for instance, this quotation from
Clark reveals his lack of education and his views of women’s roles: “Reckon you’re not
the only one it shook up . . . this thing of girls going round like they do is going to stop
right quick. Too bad, too, but everybody’ll have to see it thataway.”
 Diction: Anytime that you’re analyzing diction (word choice), you have to quote the
words that the author has selected. This point holds true when you’re discussing
either the author’s or a character’s diction. Take a look at this excerpt from Emily
Bronte’s Wuthering Heights:
The nearer I got to the house the more agitated I grew; and on catching sight of 
it I trembled in every limb. The apparition had outstripped me: it stood looking
through the gate.
You may state that the author’s word choice reinforces the extreme emotions of the
person in this passage, but without quoting “agitated,” “trembled,” and “outstripped,”
you haven’t made your case.
 Literary techniques: If, for example, you’re writing about the impact of figurative lan-
guage, you need to quote the similes or metaphors that you’re analyzing. However, be
sure you’re analyzing these devices and not simply stating that a particular literary
technique is present in the passage.
 Mood: Emily Bronte’s masterpiece, Wuthering Heights, is set in the moors of England.
Her descriptions in this story are heavy with words establishing the somber mood of
the moors: “On that bleak hill-top the earth was hard with a black frost, and the air
made me shiver through every limb.” Had I not inserted the quotation showing
Bronte’s exact descriptions (“bleak,” “hard with a black frost,” “air [that] made me
shiver”), you would have had to take my word for it when I declared that the moors 
are gloomy. The quotation proves my point.
171
Chapter 12: Writing Stellar Essays on Prose and Drama Passages

 Motivation, emotion, or state of mind: You may mention (without quoting) what a
character does, but once you get into why the character acts in a certain way or how a
character feels or thinks, you’re almost always in quotable territory. For example, the
title character of Shakespeare’s tragedy Macbeth defends himself after his wife attacks
his manhood: “I dare do all that may become a man. / Who dares do more is none.”
This quotation shows Macbeth’s ideas about masculinity and bravery in a way that 
an unquoted reference to his actions can’t.
 Selection of detail: A fair number of AP prompts mention the author’s “selection of
detail.” You should quote details the author includes as you discuss them. Otherwise,
your comments will be too general.
For example, in your essay, don’t write that the den is described meticulously. Instead,
state that the author mentions “the dusty television that hasn’t worked for years,” the
“slightly puckered wallpaper,” and the “bowl of stale potato chips next to crusted,
moldy onion dip.”
 Shifts: The AP loves shifts — shifts in point of view, shifts in tone, shifts in attitude,
shifts in technique, and so on. If you claim that something in the passage has shifted,
you sometimes have to quote to prove your point. When? If the shift is simple, say,
from one narrator to another, just mention the change. If the shift is more complex —
from sarcastic to sincere, perhaps — you may need to quote.
 Symbols: If you’re interpreting a symbol, chances are the text reveals the meaning of
the symbol. Therefore, quotations are particularly important. For instance, in Virginia
Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, the lighthouse represents (depending on the literary critic
you consult) God, Mrs. Ramsay, death, adulthood, and maybe a dozen other things. To
make a case of any of these meanings, you have to dig into the text and quote from it.
 Syntax: If you’re making a point about how a sentence is put together, you probably
need to quote the sentence. Exceptions, of course, exist. For instance, you may say
something like “Every sentence in the second paragraph is a command” without writ-
ing every word in the paragraph in the answer booklet.
 Tone: Is the author sarcastic, depressed, optimistic, or aggressive? The only way you
can support a statement about tone is by quoting, because diction and syntax are so
closely related to tone.
Selecting and inserting appropriate quotations
Reading on the AP level requires that you dig into the text, analyzing not only what the pas-
sage says but how the passage says it. Thus the words in the passage remain the best source
of evidence, and you won’t end up with a good essay unless you insert quotations into your
essay (if they’re appropriate; see the earlier section “Knowing when you can get away with-
out quoting” for more on when quotations aren’t necessary). The key is selecting the best
quotations and using them properly.
You probably already know the basics of quotation punctuation and citation (and if you
don’t, Chapter 7 explains them). But a couple of points about quoting prose and drama can
be tricky. Because prose and drama passages offer so much potential evidence, you may be
tempted to quote too often or at too great a length. So how many quotations do you need?
Here’s my answer: As many as it takes to make your point clear, and as many as you have
time to insert. Don’t leave any point unsupported by evidence of some kind. However, don’t
throw five quotations into a paragraph as support for just one assertion, unless that asser-
tion is really important.
172
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

When you do choose to quote, grab the best words and leave out the rest. Insert ellipses
(three spaced dots) wherever you’ve cut something from within one sentence. Four spaced
dots do the job when more than one sentence is missing. The first dot is the period, and the
other three dots show the omission. If you’re chopping off the end of a sentence that has a
question mark or an exclamation point, think twice before sharpening your ax. Why? The
reader should be able to tell that the words belong to a question or to an emphatic state-
ment. In other words, don’t take out anything that changes the meaning of the quotation.
If you’re quoting more than three lines (measured by your own handwriting in the answer
booklet), you should block the quotation by centering it on the page and indenting both the
right and left margins. In a blocked quotation, omit quotation marks unless you’re quoting
dialogue embedded in the narrative, as in this example from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Over Tilly”:
The Jelly-bean hesitated. “I don’t know,” he began slowly, “somethin’ about — about
that girl last night talkin’ about a lady named Diana Manners — an English lady, sorta
got me thinkin’!” He drew himself up and looked oddly at Clark, “I had a family once,”
he said defiantly.
If you’re quoting an exchange between characters in a play, you also can block the dialogue.
Here’s an example from Eugene O’Neill’s Anna Christie:
ANNA — [half-frightenedly — trying to laugh it off] You have? When? I thought you
was saying —
BURKE — [boldly and forcefully] This night. [hanging his head — humbly] If she’ll
be having me. [Then raising his eyes to hers — simply] ‘Tis you I mean.
If you leave a line or more of dialogue out of a blocked quotation, insert a line of dots to show
the omission:
ANNA — [half-frightenedly — trying to laugh it off] You have? When? I thought you
was saying—
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
CHRIS — Anna! [he comes toward them, raging, his fists clenched.] Anna, you gat in
cabin, you hear!
If you’re blocking a quotation, however, you may be writing too much. After all, remember
that the clock is always ticking your exam minutes away. Instead of blocking, try selecting 
relevant words from the text and tucking them into your own sentence, like so:
Anna’s confusion is evident when she asks Burke, “You have? When?” He replies, “If she’ll be
having me.”
Building on the Intro: Organizing 
and Discussing Your Ideas
AP English exam graders don’t expect you to wow them with an original, never-before-seen
organizational pattern. They do love to see creativity, but they also know that you’re under
pressure. And face the facts: In 40 minutes, you don’t have time to reinvent the wheel. Save
your experiments in structure for take-home papers! Go with the traditional introduction,
body paragraphs, and conclusion for your prose or drama essay.
173
Chapter 12: Writing Stellar Essays on Prose and Drama Passages

The grand presentation: Body paragraphs
The body paragraphs of an essay on prose and drama may be organized in several different
ways, such as the following:
 One paragraph for each literary device (element of style) that you’re discussing.
For example, your essay may be divided into three body paragraphs: one for dialogue,
one for a character’s thoughts, and one for a description of an important topic from 
the story.
 One paragraph for each subtopic. If you’re writing about a character’s conflict with
her mother, for example, you may have subtopics about the origin of the fight, the 
way the mother and daughter communicate, and the effects of their struggle on other 
characters. The literary devices may be placed in each body paragraph as needed. 
For instance, if the origin of the fight is explained metaphorically, discuss that tech-
nique in the paragraph devoted to the initial stage of their conflict.
 In a compare and contrast essay (a format often useful for nonfiction selections),
one paragraph may address similarities and another one may discuss differences.
Or, one paragraph may be devoted to the first element that you’re comparing and
another to the second element. This structure is particularly helpful for an essay about
two different attitudes or characters or for some sort of shift.
 Body paragraphs may follow the organizational pattern of the passage. With this
structure, you work your way through the passage, making every point possible along
the way. Whenever you find a natural break (say, a shift in emphasis or tone), start a
new paragraph.
If you have 15 minutes left and one whole essay is incomplete, try this structure. It’s
made for speed. You think as you write, recording what you see. Of course, budgeting
your time to allow the full 40 minutes is a better strategy, but if you get caught short, 
at least you’ll rescue some credit.
Regardless of how you structure the essay, be sure to analyze the text in relation to the
prompt. Don’t simply retell the story or list literary techniques. Take a peek at this example
illustrating both good and bad analysis in a prose or drama essay:
Bad analysis: The scene between Jane and Mrs. Reed is composed almost entirely of
dialogue, so dialogue is the dominant technique here.
Why it’s bad: The writer has simply mentioned the technique, not discussed its effect
on the reader. Also, the writer has said the same thing twice! Repetition wastes time —
yours and the graders’.
Good analysis: Because the scene between Jane and Mrs. Reed is composed almost
entirely of dialogue, the reader has little information about their appearance or location.
The struggle between the two is highlighted; nothing distracts the reader from their con-
flict, just as nothing distracts the characters from their fight.
Why it’s good: Now the essay explains why dialogue is important in this scene.
Making a statement based on your 
evidence: The conclusion
In Chapter 3, I explain in detail how to come to a conclusion in an AP essay, and I tell you
what to avoid (“In this essay I have proved,” summaries, repetitive remarks, and so forth). In
this section, I simply illustrate a couple of good conclusions for prose and drama essays:
174
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Essay content: A discussion of Thomas Friedman’s essay on American values.
Conclusion: Friedman’s description of the graduation at Eastern Middle School, where
children from every ethnicity, religion, and race are in harmony, creates a striking con-
trast to the single-minded intolerance of the September 11th terrorists.
Essay content: Analysis of Willy Loman as a tragic hero whose downfall arises from his
inability to face reality.
Conclusion: Willy’s suicide at the end of the play is tempered with a sense of inevitabil-
ity. Like an animal that cannot adapt to a new environment, his shortcomings were
bound to his downfall. The hope, then, is that the others who were affected will be able
to overcome the challenges that ruined Willy — that they will not be tragic figures as he
was. “We are free,” sobs Linda at Willy’s funeral — the ultimate acceptance of reality.
Notice that both conclusions are quite short, but each packs a punch. The second conclu-
sion is particularly effective because the final quotation sums up the play, Willy’s relation-
ship with his family, and the possible future of the remaining characters — quite an
accomplishment for four sentences!
On Your Mark, Get Set, Go! 
A Sample Prose Essay
I couldn’t possibly publish this essay chapter without showing you a complete essay based
on a prose passage, complete with an evaluation of its strengths and weaknesses. Check out
the following sections, which give you just that.
Sample excerpt and prompt
Read this excerpt from Joseph Conrad’s novella, The Secret Sharer. In a well-organized essay,
discuss the stylistic devices Conrad uses to reveal the relationship between the captain and
Leggatt.
“What’s the matter?” I asked in my ordinary tone, speaking down to the face upturned
exactly under mine.
“Cramp,” it answered, no louder. Then slightly anxious, “I say, no need to call anyone.”
“I was not going to,” I said.
“Are you alone on deck?”
“Yes.”
I had somehow the impression that he was on the point of letting go the ladder to swim
away beyond my ken — mysterious as he came. But, for the moment, this being appear-
ing as if he had risen from the bottom of the sea (it was certainly the nearest land to the
ship) wanted only to know the time. I told him. And he, down there, tentatively:
“I suppose your captain’s turned in?”
“I am sure he isn’t,” I said.
He seemed to struggle with himself, for I heard something like the low, bitter murmur of
doubt. “What’s the good?” His next words came out with a hesitating effort.
“Look here, my man. Could you call him out quietly?”

I thought the time had come to declare myself. “I am the captain.”
I heard a “By Jove!” whispered at the level of the water. The phosphorescence flashed in
the swirl of the water all about his limbs, his other hand seized the ladder.
“My name’s Leggatt.”
The voice was calm and resolute. A good voice. The self-possession of that man had
somehow induced a corresponding state in myself. It was very quietly that I remarked:
“You must be a good swimmer.”
“Yes. I’ve been in the water practically since nine o’clock. The question for me now is
whether I am to let go this ladder and go on swimming till I sink from exhaustion, or —
to come on board here.”
I felt this was no mere formula of desperate speech, but a real alternative in the view of a
strong soul. I should have gathered from this that he was young; indeed, it is only the
young who are ever confronted by such clear issues. But at the time it was pure intuition
on my part. A mysterious communication was established already between us two — in
the face of that silent, darkened tropical sea. I was young, too; young enough to make no
comment. The man in the water began suddenly to climb up the ladder, and I hastened
away from the rail to fetch some clothes.
Before entering the cabin I stood still, listening in the lobby at the foot of the stairs. A
faint snore came through the closed door of the chief mate’s room. The second mate’s
door was on the hook, but the darkness in there was absolutely soundless. He, too, was
young and could sleep like a stone. There remained the steward, but he was not likely to
wake up before he was called. I got a sleeping suit out of my room and, coming back on
deck, saw the naked man from the sea sitting on the main hatch, glimmering white in the
darkness, his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands. In a moment he had con-
cealed his damp body in a sleeping suit of the same gray-stripe pattern as the one I was
wearing and followed me like my double on the poop1. Together we moved right aft2,
barefooted, silent.
“What is it?” I asked in a deadened voice, taking the lighted lamp out of the binnacle, and
raising it to his face.
“An ugly business.”
He had rather regular features; a good mouth; light eyes under somewhat heavy, dark
eyebrows; a smooth, square forehead; no growth on his cheeks; a small, brown mus-
tache, and a well-shaped, round chin. His expression was concentrated, meditative,
under the inspecting light of the lamp I held up to his face; such as a man thinking hard
in solitude might wear. My sleeping suit was just right for his size. A well-knit young
fellow of twenty-five at most. He caught his lower lip with the edge of white, even teeth.
1. A deck.
2. Toward the rear of the ship.
Sample essay
Here’s a sample essay written in response to the prompt shown in the previous section:
This excerpt from Joseph Conrad’s The Secret Sharer describes an encounter between
two men, one the captain of a ship and the other a desperate, naked man in the water.
Through dialogue, description, and the narrator’s evaluation of the swimmer, the men
become mirror images of each other.
176

The identification between the two is made immediately when the narrator says that the
swimmer’s face was “upturned exactly under mine.” Water reflects light, and it is as if
the captain were looking in a mirror. The identification continues when the narrator
hears the swimmer’s voice, which is “calm and resolute.” The tone of the swimmer’s
voice brings about “a corresponding state in myself.” The swimmer is naked, and 
when he boards the ship, the captain gives him a “sleeping suit of the same gray-stripe
pattern as the one I was wearing” and which is “just right for his size.” Once again, the
two characters are equated. Also, it’s important that the characters are identified with
each other by means of a sleeping suit because in dreams, peoples’ true selves come out
and daytime facades drop away.
The swimmer, whose name is Leggatt, “followed me [the captain] like a double.” The
captain says that he is young, and later refers to Leggatt as young also. When Leggatt
follows the captain, the captain says that they moved toward the back of the boat
together.
When the two men converse, they are both terse. The captain’s “I am the captain” is
answered by “By Jove” and “My name’s Leggatt.” Later the captain asks, “What is it?”
and Leggatt replies, “An ugly business.” Neither goes into detail, and both are surpris-
ingly calm, despite Leggatt’s situation, even though the captain speaks of Leggatt’s 
“desperate speech.”
The fact that the two men are alone is also significant. The rest of the sailors are asleep,
and the solitude of the men binds them. They are, as the title implies, “secret sharers” 
in each other’s life. When the captain holds a lamp up to Leggatt’s face, the captain sees
“a man thinking hard in solitude,” which is what the captain was doing on deck.
Finally, the captain explains that “a mysterious communication was established already
between us two.” These characters are connected, as Conrad makes clear.
Evaluation of the sample essay
The sample essay has its flaws, but it accomplishes its basic task — to define the relation-
ship between the men and to explain how that relationship is conveyed. If I were grading this
essay, I would award it an 8, which is close to the highest mark and generally in “5” territory
when it comes to the overall exam grade. (For more information on how the exam is scored,
see Chapter 1.)
Here are the good points of the sample essay:
 The essay addresses the prompt, stating correctly that the captain and Leggatt mirror
each other.
 The essay quotes frequently from the text, supporting the mirror-image assertion with
quite a bit of evidence.
 The quotations are well chosen and snipped down to just what’s needed. The writer
has included no unnecessary words.
 The quotations are inserted smoothly into the text and punctuated properly.
 The essay addresses literary technique fairly well, pointing out dialogue and the 
narrator’s description.
 The essay is reasonably well organized. It has a good introduction and, for the most
part, has logical body-paragraph divisions.
177
Chapter 12: Writing Stellar Essays on Prose and Drama Passages

The following are points for improvement:
 The introduction is a bit fuzzy when it comes to correctly identifying the literary tech-
niques that Conrad employs. Dialogue and description are, in fact, literary techniques.
What the writer calls “the narrator’s evaluation of the swimmer” would be better
described as “narrative” or “the narrator’s point of view.”
 The organization isn’t bad, but the second and third paragraphs are divided without
good reason. They would be better combined into one paragraph.
 The conclusion is weak, probably because the writer ran out of time. The last sentence
is repetitive and general.
 The quotations aren’t cited by line number. (Strictly speaking, you don’t absolutely
have to cite line numbers, but if you have time, go for it.)

 Sharpening skills with multiple-choice sample questions
 Writing practice essays on prose and drama selections
 Analyzing your strengths and weaknesses
You can’t learn to ride a bike by reading an instruction manual. You have to hit the road
and start peddling. Similarly, you can’t perfect your prose- and drama-question skills
until you go around the block a couple of times, answering multiple-choice questions and
writing practice essays. Conveniently, this chapter contains samples of both types of ques-
tions. Try some, check your answers, and read the explanations. If you come across any
wrong answers or any essays that miss the target, review the basic concepts in Chapter 9 
(fiction and drama) or Chapter 10 (nonfiction). If the problem you’re having concerns 
the format of the questions, head for Chapter 11 (multiple-choice strategy) or Chapter 12
(essay instructions). Then go out for a real bike ride; you deserve a break!
Choosing an Answer from Multiple Options
The dreaded letters A–E stub the toes of many a fine English student. But don’t worry. Your
toes are safe because in this section, I’m going to make sure that you can sprint through
prose and drama multiple-choice questions. On the actual exam, you’ll see excerpts of novels
or stories, and you’ll probably encounter a nonfiction selection. Drama has a cameo role
every once in a while. I’ve labeled the practice sets in this chapter as nonfiction, fiction, or
drama so that later you can figure out where your strengths and weaknesses lie. The AP
exam writers generally aren’t as nice. The only information they might give you is the title
and author of a passage (and that’s usually only when there are copyright requirements).
Practice set 1 (nonfiction)
Carefully read the following essay by Henry David Thoreau and answer the questions that
follow.
I, who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring some rust, and
when sometimes I have stolen forth for a walk at the eleventh hour, or four o’clock 
in the afternoon, too late to redeem the day, when the shades of night were already
beginning to be mingled with the daylight, have felt as if I had committed some sin to be
atoned for — I confess that I am astonished at the power of endurance, to say nothing of
(01)
(05)

the moral insensibility, of my neighbors who confine themselves to shops and offices
the whole day for weeks and months, aye, and years almost together. I know not what
manner of stuff they are of — sitting there now at three o’clock in the afternoon, as if it
were three o’clock in the morning. Bonaparte1 may talk of the three-o’clock-in-the-morn-
ing courage, but it is nothing to the courage which can sit down cheerfully at this hour
in the afternoon over against one’s self whom you have known all the morning, to starve
out a garrison to whom you are bound by such strong ties of sympathy. I wonder that
about this time, or say between four and five o’clock in the afternoon, too late for the
morning papers and too early for the evening ones, there is not a general explosion
heard up and down the street, scattering a legion of antiquated and house-bred notions
and whims to the four winds for an airing — and so the evil cure itself.
How womankind, who are confined to the house still more than men, stand it I do not
know; but I have ground to suspect that most of them do not STAND it at all. When, early
in a summer afternoon, we have been shaking the dust of the village from the skirts of
our garments, making haste past those houses with purely Doric or Gothic2 fronts,
which have such an air of repose about them, my companion whispers that probably
about these times their occupants are all gone to bed. Then it is that I appreciate the
beauty and the glory of architecture, which itself never turns in, but forever stands out
and erect, keeping watch over the slumberers.
No doubt temperament, and, above all, age, have a good deal to do with it. As a man
grows older, his ability to sit still and follow indoor occupations increases. He grows ves-
pertinal3 in his habits as the evening of life approaches, till at last he comes forth only
just before sundown, and gets all the walk that he requires in half an hour.
But the walking of which I speak has nothing in it akin to taking exercise, as it is called,
as the sick take medicine at stated hours — as the Swinging of dumb-bells or chairs; but
is itself the enterprise and adventure of the day. If you would get exercise, go in search
of the springs of life. Think of a man’s swinging dumbbells for his health, when those
springs are bubbling up in far-off pastures unsought by him!
Moreover, you must walk like a camel, which is said to be the only beast which rumi-
nates when walking. When a traveler asked Wordsworth’s servant to show him her
master’s study, she answered, “Here is his library, but his study is out of doors.”
Living much out of doors, in the sun and wind, will no doubt produce a certain rough-
ness of character — will cause a thicker cuticle to grow over some of the finer qualities
of our nature, as on the face and hands, or as severe manual labor robs the hands of
some of their delicacy of touch. So staying in the house, on the other hand, may pro-
duce a softness and smoothness, not to say thinness of skin, accompanied by an
increased sensibility to certain impressions. Perhaps we should be more susceptible to
some influences important to our intellectual and moral growth, if the sun had shone
and the wind blown on us a little less; and no doubt it is a nice matter to proportion
rightly the thick and thin skin.
1. Napoleon Bonaparte, famous general and Emperor of France.
2. Architectural styles.
3. Referring to the late afternoon.
1. In the context of line 1, the “rust” that the narrator acquires may be defined as
(A) mental illness
(B) metallic corrosion
(C) ill-effects of inactivity
(D) physical weakness
(E) emotional disturbance

The narrator can’t stay inside “without acquiring some rust” (line 1). The remedy is to go out
for a walk. Therefore, you can assume that he feels the ill-effects of sitting inside all day, a
concept best expressed by choice (C). Did (D) tempt you? Old, creaky joints (I have some!)
may certainly indicate “physical weakness,” but you don’t get them in one day, the length of
time specified in the passage. Because of this fact, (C) is a better answer.
2. The purpose of lines 1–7 (“I, who cannot . . . years almost together”) is to
(A) describe the late afternoon hours
(B) equate indoor inactivity with moral failing
(C) explain the narrator’s habits
(D) compare the narrator to shop and office workers
(E) establish the context of the narrator’s remarks
The passage opens by informing you that the narrator gets ants in his pants if he doesn’t go
outside for a walk at least once. Then the narrator thinks about the “endurance” (line 5) and
“moral insensibility” (line 6) of those who are stuck inside all day, every day — the shop and
office workers. These lines establish a comparison, as (D) specifies.
3. In the context of line 8, “stuff” may best be defined as
(A) character
(B) physical properties
(C) material goods
(D) personal possessions
(E) habits
The narrator harshly judges those who work in shops and offices. He even speculates that
they’re less moral because they’re alienated from nature, and he wonders how they can
stand their lives. He wonders what stuff, or character, allows them to stay inside for years on
end. Choice (A) wins the prize.
4. The purpose of the allusion to Bonaparte in line 9 is to
(A) imply that people all over the world feel the same as the narrator does
(B) make the reader consider the nature of courage
(C) establish that the narrator is an insomniac
(D) emphasize the courage needed to forgo outdoor activity
(E) belittle the courage of indoor workers
An allusion refers to an element outside the literary work that brings into the work all the
associations, information, and emotions attached to that element. In lines 9–10, Thoreau
alludes to a statement by Napoleon Bonaparte, and the notes tell you that Napoleon was
both a general and an emperor. The courage Napoleon needed to go into battle was consider-
able. By alluding to Napoleon’s comment, Thoreau emphasizes that “three-o’clock-in-the-
morning” courage pales in comparison to the courage of those who stay in at three in the
afternoon. You may have been tempted by choice (E). The paragraph does contain a compar-
ison, but some key words are omitted. In fact, Thoreau is employing irony by saying the
opposite of (E), that Napoleon’s courage “is nothing [when compared] to the courage” 
(line 10) of those who “can sit down cheerfully” (line 10) at 3 p.m.
181
Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

5. The “garrison to whom you are bound by such strong ties of sympathy” (line 12)
most likely refers to
(A) ideas
(B) the townspeople
(C) shop and office workers
(D) Napoleon’s soldiers
(E) walkers
The “garrison” of line 12 (another military image), refers to brain cells or the ideas they gen-
erate. Because only the second of those two items appears in the multiple-choice list, go with
(A). The key to figuring out this question is the reference in line 11 to “one’s self whom you
have known all the morning” and the reference in line 15 to “antiquated and house-bred
notions.” “Notions” are ideas, and philosophically, your “self.” As the French philosopher
Descartes put it, “I think; therefore I am.”
6. What is the narrator’s attitude toward the “general explosion” (line 14)?
(A) He is surprised that it takes place.
(B) He fears it.
(C) He cannot understand why it occurs.
(D) He thinks it would be a positive event.
(E) He sees it as evil.
The narrator says “I wonder” (line 12), not in the sense of speculation but more along 
the lines of Alice in Wonderland; he’s surprised and awed that “there is not” (line 14) an
explosion, which would have a positive effect, “scattering a legion of antiquated and house-
bred notions and whims” (lines 15–16) and bringing about a “cure” (line 16). Thus, (D) is the
correct answer.
7. Overall, the second paragraph (lines 17–24) marks a shift from
(A) a male to a female narrator
(B) a light to a serious tone
(C) indoors to outdoors
(D) military to religious metaphors
(E) personal to universal
The first paragraph talks about how terrible it is to be inside all day. True, it ends with a 
reference to “the street” (line 15), but the question says “overall,” and the bulk of the first
paragraph concerns indoor life. The second paragraph begins with a reference to women,
whom the narrator views as even more housebound than men. However, the narrator doesn’t
change, so you have to rule out choice (A). The second paragraph goes outside, when you’re
“making haste past those houses” (line 20) and have been “shaking the dust of the village” off
(line 19). Clearly, (C) is the answer you want. Were you fooled by (D)? True, the first para-
graph is army-oriented; Thoreau alludes to Napoleon (a general) and talks about a “garrison”
(line 12), an “explosion” (line 14), and a “legion” (line 15). The second paragraph, however,
doesn’t venture into religious territory.
8. The pronoun “it” (line 17) refers to
(A) temperament
(B) confinement
(C) the ability to walk
(D) age
(E) the advantages of walking
182
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Womankind, the narrator says, “are confined to the house” (line 17) but, he suspects, do not
“stand it” (line 18). Hence “it” refers to confinement, choice (B).
9. The purpose of the fourth paragraph (lines 29–33) is to
(A) emphasize the importance of mental exercise
(B) explain the physical benefits of exercise
(C) discuss the value of exercise
(D) persuade the reader to exercise in varied ways
(E) emphasize the superiority of walking to other forms of exercise
Thoreau, I think it’s safe to say, would not join a gym and settle in on a treadmill. For him,
outdoors is the place to be, walking and thinking at the same time. The fourth paragraph
belittles the fitness crowd, referring to “the Swinging of dumb-bells or chairs” (line 30) as
inferior to walking, which is the “adventure of the day” (line 31). Therefore, choice (E) is the
answer you’re looking for.
10. The comment from Wordsworth’s servant (line 36)
(A) implies that Wordsworth thinks less in his library than outdoors
(B) implies that Wordsworth studies nature
(C) disparages Wordsworth’s connection with books
(D) emphasizes Wordsworth’s appreciation of nature
(E) criticizes Wordsworth’s study habits
Wordsworth’s “study” is the place where he thinks. The comment stands by itself, but it’s
reinforced by the reference to a camel, “which is said to be the only beast which ruminates
[thinks] when walking” (lines 34–35). True, Wordsworth did appreciate nature. His poetry is
filled with flowers, oceans, rocks, and everything else under the sun. (The sun’s in his poetry
too.) However, the servant’s comment isn’t about Wordsworth’s views on nature but rather
about what he does when he’s in contact with nature. And like a camel, he thinks when he’s
walking. Choice (A) is the correct answer.
11. The “cuticle” (line 38) is most likely meant to be interpreted as a
(A) physical barrier
(B) natural process
(C) deadening of physical sensation
(D) sign of honest labor
(E) lessening of moral and intellectual sensibility
The cuticle is a metaphor, not a physical reality. Thoreau cautions that too much time 
outdoors can have an effect on “the finer qualities of our nature” (lines 38–39). Later in that 
paragraph, the finer qualities are described as “intellectual and moral growth” (line 43). Go
for (E) as your answer.
12. Which of the following is the best interpretation of “it is a nice matter to proportion
rightly the thick and thin skin” (lines 44–45)?
(A) Care is needed to find the correct balance between indoor and outdoor activity.
(B) Kind, friendly people balance indoor and outdoor activity.
(C) Sensitivity and roughness must be in balance.
(D) You control the amount of sensitivity in your life.
(E) Physical activity has unpredictable results.
183
Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

The word “nice” has come to mean “friendly” or “good-natured,” but it also means “neatly” or
“with precision,” which is the definition that’s operating in this passage. The “thick and thin
skin” are metaphors for too much time outdoors (thick) and indoors (thin). Thoreau advo-
cates a balance, so (A) is the best choice.
Practice set 2 (fiction)
Carefully read the following passage, which is an excerpt from a comic novel written in the
late 18th century, and answer the questions that follow.
No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed
her born to be an heroine. Her situation in life, the character of her father and mother,
her own person and disposition, were all equally against her. Her father was a clergy-
man, without being neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his name
was Richard — and he had never been handsome. He had a considerable independence
besides two good livings — and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his
daughters. Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense, with a good temper, and,
what is more remarkable, with a good constitution. She had three sons before Catherine
was born; and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody might
expect, she still lived on — lived to have six children more — to see them growing up
around her, and to enjoy excellent health herself. A family of ten children will be always
called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number;
but the Morlands had little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain,
and Catherine, for many years of her life, as plain as any. She had a thin awkward figure,
a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and strong features — so much for her
person; and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind. She was fond of all
boy’s plays, and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic
enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-
bush. Indeed she had no taste for a garden; and if she gathered flowers at all, it was
chiefly for the pleasure of mischief — at least so it was conjectured from her always pre-
ferring those which she was forbidden to take. Such were her propensities — her abili-
ties were quite as extraordinary. She never could learn or understand anything before
she was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she was often inattentive, and occa-
sionally stupid. Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the “Beggar’s
Petition”; and after all, her next sister, Sally, could say it better than she did. Not that
Catherine was always stupid — by no means; she learnt the fable of “The Hare and
Many Friends” as quickly as any girl in England. Her mother wished her to learn music;
and Catherine was sure she should like it, for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of
the old forlorn spinner; so, at eight years old she began. She learnt a year, and could not
bear it; and Mrs. Morland, who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in
spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her to leave off. The day which dismissed the
music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine’s life. Her taste for drawing was not
superior; though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or
seize upon any other odd piece of paper, she did what she could in that way, by drawing
houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like one another. Writing and
accounts she was taught by her father; French by her mother: her proficiency in either
was not remarkable, and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could. What a
strange, unaccountable character! — for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten
years old, she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely
ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones, with few interruptions of tyranny; she
was moreover noisy and wild, hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so
well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.
Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were mending; she
began to curl her hair and long for balls; her complexion improved, her features were
softened by plumpness and colour, her eyes gained more animation, and her figure

more consequence. Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she grew
clean as she grew smart; she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and
mother remark on her personal improvement. “Catherine grows quite a good-looking
girl — she is almost pretty today,” were words which caught her ears now and then; and
how welcome were the sounds! To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight
to a girl who has been looking plain the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from
her cradle can ever receive.
13. One can infer from the passage that the traditional characteristics of a heroine include
all of the following EXCEPT
(A) being born into an impoverished family
(B) ill-treatment from family members
(C) being orphaned or left motherless
(D) great beauty
(E) average intelligence
This wonderful excerpt from Northanger Abbey, a novel by Jane Austen, begins with an 
explanation of why it was unlikely that Catherine Morland would be considered a heroine. 
All the things that Catherine lacks are listed, and by implication, those qualities are assigned
to heroines. The only thing she does have is average — or even at times below-average — 
intelligence. Hence (E) is the answer you seek.
14. The passage as a whole may be characterized as
(A) vicious sarcasm
(B) straightforward exposition
(C) gentle mockery
(D) sentimental reflection
(E) incisive analysis
This question addresses tone, and Austen’s tone is mocking, but not vicious, as indicated in
choice (A). Therefore, (C) is the best answer. Can’t you hear the little laughter at such
tongue-in-cheek comments as “instead of dying in bringing the latter [Catherine] into the
world, as anybody might expect, she still lived on” (lines 9–10)? By the way, the exposition
referred to in (B) is background information, the explanation that sets up the story. This pas-
sage tells a lot about Catherine, but it doesn’t begin a story. Nor do (D) and (E) make the cut.
This author is anything but sentimental, as Catherine is evaluated critically in the passage.
Nor does the passage delve into the reasons for Catherine’s behavior, so “incisive analysis”
doesn’t fit.
15. The characterization of Catherine Morland is achieved primarily by
(A) a recital of what she is not
(B) a description of her family
(C) a list of her pastimes
(D) an account of her accomplishments
(E) an explanation of her mother’s point of view
The whole first paragraph is negative and describes what Catherine is not: She was not 
poor, her parents weren’t cruel, her mother didn’t die when Catherine was born, and
Catherine wasn’t pretty. True, some of her accomplishments are listed (she learned a fable
and, eventually, a poem), but they also illustrate her lack of brain power and talent. Thus, go
with choice (A).
185
Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions
(50)

16. The statement that Catherine’s father was named Richard (line 5) implies that
(A) Richard is not a suitable name for the father of a heroine.
(B) The fathers of other heroines have that name.
(C) Men named Richard are generally not respectable.
(D) Men named Richard are generally respectable.
(E) The father’s name should be unusual.
The fact that Catherine’s father is named Richard (line 5) is introduced by the word
“though.” Just before that statement, Catherine’s father is described as “respectable” (line 4).
The implication is that men named Richard aren’t usually respectable. (Don’t blame me. I like
the name Richard.) Clearly (C) is the best answer.
17. Which of the following statements is closest in meaning to “a family of ten children will
always be called a fine family, where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the
number” (lines 11–12)?
(A) The label “fine family” is frequently applied without much thought.
(B) Any family with ten children is fine.
(C) The criteria for the label “a fine family” are very strict.
(D) The label “fine family” is usually applied inappropriately.
(E) People who say that a family is “fine” are generally lying.
The key to this answer is tone and context. For instance, if you’re counting fingers, you may
miss one and not suffer a huge deficit. However, if you’re counting heads, the proper number
is a lot more important. The author’s tone is mocking, and she implies that the label “fine
family” is slapped on without much consideration of the family’s quality. You should choose
(A) as your answer.
18. The author mentions “the Beggar’s Petition” (lines 24–25) and “The Hare and Many
Friends” 
(lines 26–27) probably to show
(A) that children in England were required to memorize literary works
(B) Catherine’s inconsistent efforts in learning
(C) Mrs. Morland’s inadequate teaching ability
(D) that poems are easier to learn than fables
(E) Catherine’s dislike of literature
Catherine can learn, but sometimes she learns slowly and sometimes “as quickly as any girl
in England” (line 27). Thus she’s inconsistent, and choice (B) is the winner.
19. “The day which dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest of Catherine’s life” 
(lines 31–32) is an example of
(A) hyperbole
(B) exposition
(C) irony
(D) characterization
(E) dramatization
Okay, maybe Catherine was happy, but “one of the happiest” days of her life? You’re in exag-
geration territory here, which, in lit-speak, is hyperbole, or choice (A). Just for the record,
however, exposition occurs when the author gives background information that’s necessary
186
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

to understand the plot. Irony shows up when you say the opposite of what you mean, and
characterization is everything the author does to illustrate character. Choice (E), dramatiza-
tion, isn’t really a literary term. You dramatize a novel by turning it into a play, a meaning
that doesn’t apply here.
20. According to the passage, why is Catherine’s character deemed “strange” (line 38) and
“unaccountable” (line 38)?
(A) She has “interruptions of tyranny” (line 40).
(B) Catherine refuses to conform to gender roles.
(C) Catherine does not live up to her potential.
(D) Her character is unnaturally consistent.
(E) Her failings are not accompanied by antisocial tendencies.
The crucial word here is “for” (line 38), which in this sentence means “because.” After you
crack that definition in context, you’re home free, because the second half of the sentence
explains exactly why Catherine’s character was “strange” and “unaccountable”: She “had 
neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, 
and very kind to the little ones” (lines 39–40). In other words, she was a normal girl with
some failings and inconsistencies. Therefore, choice (E) is the winner here.
21. The change in Catherine at fifteen (lines 43–52)
(A) marks a shift in point of view
(B) places Catherine in the context of her society
(C) is consistent with the tone of the rest of the passage
(D) marks a shift in tone
(E) implies that Catherine will never be as beautiful as a girl who has been “a beauty
from her cradle” (lines 51–52)
The gentle mockery of the rest of the passage continues when Catherine matures. She’s less
happy to be dirty and loves to hear that she’s “almost pretty today” (line 49). Without a
doubt, (C) is the best answer.
22. The word “mending” in the context of line 43 may best be defined as
(A) sewing
(B) improving
(C) reconciling
(D) altering
(E) healing
Catherine’s appearance has improved; her hair, figure, features, and habits are all “mending.”
True, choice (D) is a possibility, because Catherine is in fact changing, and “alter” does mean
“change.” However, (B) is more specific and thus a better choice.

Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

“Where you want this stuff!” Joe asked.
“Anywhere,” Sidney said.
The boxes clunked as Joe knelt and dropped them beside Sidney’s portable stereo.
Mr. Lewis and his potential fiancée slogged up the stairs, the things they carried clatter-
ing against the banister.
“There you are,” she said, looking at Sidney as she stepped inside the room. “It’s a
good thing you got the door open. ‘Cause we wouldn’t have known what room to come to.”
“Sorry about that,” Sidney said.
Against a wall she and Mr. Lewis placed luggage and boxes.
She exhaled deeply. “I must be getting old.” She smiled and caressed her flaccid
biceps. “That one little suitcase had my arms hurting.”
“Mom, this is Brian, one of my roommates.”
“Nice to meet you.”
Brian shook her hand. “It’s nice to meet you, too.”
“And this is Mr. Lewis,” Sidney said with all the courtesy he could muster but with-
out looking at the man.
“Call me ‘William,’ Mr. Lewis said, shaking Brian’s hand. “I’ve been trying to get
Sidney to do the same, but he insists on calling me by my last name. Like I’m his boss or
something.”
Sidney knew he should banter with Mr. Lewis to show there were no hard feelings.
But he said nothing.
“So, Brian,” Sidney’s mom began and Sidney wondered if she was intentionally
relieving the mounting tension, “I see you’re an early riser. I thought we were early. But
you beat us here.”
“Yeah, I don’t think my parents could have waited another moment to get me out of
the house.”
“We heard that, Brian,” a baritone voice said, its Boston accent even sharper and
swifter than Brian’s. At the bottom of the stairs appeared a man with a bald, perfectly
round head and a short, stocky body. He took two steps at a time, a glass coffee table in
his hands and a stuffed backpack over one shoulder. Behind him trailed a woman with
bright eyes and red wavy hair, which she wore in a bob. She carried a lamp. . . in both
hands.
“Dad, did you get lost?” Brian asked, in the doorway now.
“Only in conversation,” his father said, pausing on the landing and facing Brian, who
was much taller. Brian’s father hadn’t made room for his wife, so she stood behind him
and beneath him, on the top stair. “We met some fellow parents outside. It seems they
— unlike your mother and I, of course — were at first glad to be rid of their daughter. All
summer she worried them to no end, anxious, able to think and talk about nothing but
how fun and challenging Princeton would be. She and her parents couldn’t wait for the
fall. But now that the moment of parting has come, neither the parents nor the child
wants to say goodbye. Typical, isn’t it, dear?” he asked, turning to his wife.
“It is,” she said and beamed.
“I know what you mean,” Sidney’s mom began, and Brian stepped out of the door-
way, apparently so that his parents could see who was talking. “A lot of times this week,
I caught Sidney here just sitting on the couch, lost in thought.”
Sidney’s skin flushed hot.
He and his mom exchanged a look that communicated their acknowledgement of
what he’d really been thinking about last week, that communicated their ready agree-
ment to make no mention of the subject here.
“At first, I was worried,” she continued, still watching him. “Then I realized. . . he’s
just got school on his mind. It’s a big step. The biggest they’ve taken so far.”
Sidney exhaled and realized he hadn’t been breathing at all. And now to inhale and
exhale was so soothing to his body it seemed he’d discovered life’s greatest luxury.
As he watched his mom talk, watched her lips move and her hands gesticulate, it
seemed he was meeting her for the very first time. He’d never known she was capable of
such subtlety: just now, while making small talk with Brian’s parents, she’d managed to
simultaneously carry on an inaudible conversation with him. This was the second time
today she’d surprised him. First, his realization of why she’d dyed her hair and always
wore trendy clothes. Now, this. And why did she tacitly broach the events and near-
events of that hot August night? Probably to reprimand him yet again.

23. The “potential fiancée” (line 4) refers to
(A) Mrs. Lewis
(B) Brian’s mother
(C) Mr. Lewis
(D) the woman Joe intends to marry
(E) Sidney’s mother
Sidney’s mother accompanies Mr. Lewis into the room, and shortly thereafter Sidney calls
her “Mom.” Bingo: (E) is the answer.
24. In this passage, Sidney’s relationship with Mr. Lewis is portrayed as
(A) close
(B) antagonistic
(C) professional
(D) discourteous
(E) filial
“Antagonistic” means “hostile.” Sidney answers Mr. Lewis “with all the courtesy he could
muster but without looking at the man” (lines 15–16), a statement implying trouble between
the two, or at least trouble from Sidney’s point of view. Did I stump you with choice (E)?
“Filial” is the term for “son-to-father” sentiments and carries a connotation of respect and
obligation. Sidney’s behavior — not looking at Mr. Lewis, not bantering with him — may cer-
tainly characterize some filial relationships, but in this case, “antagonistic,” choice (B), is a
better fit.
25. In this scene, Sidney reevaluates his mother in terms of which of the following?
I.
Her understanding of what he’s thinking.
II.
Her social skills.
III. Her choice of clothing.
(A) I only.
(B) I and II.
(C) II and III.
(D) I and III.
(E) All of the above.
Sidney isn’t surprised that his mother knows what he’s thinking. The look that they exchange
in line 47 implies that she has been aware of his concerns before. However, the passage
states that Sidney had “never known she was capable of such subtlety” (lines 55–56) and he 
marvels at her ability to make small talk, a social skill. The passage also refers to Sidney’s
understanding of “why she’d dyed her hair and always wore trendy clothes” (lines 58–59).
Therefore, II and III are correct, but I isn’t. Go for (C).
26. The characterization of Brian’s mother implies that she
(A) takes a subservient role
(B) dominates her son
(C) feels superior to Sidney’s mother
(D) is too attached to her son
(E) is happy to be parted from her son
189
Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

Brian’s mother stands “behind and beneath” (lines 35–36) her husband and says very little. 
In fact, her only lines are a short statement agreeing with her husband’s comment. Sounds
subservient to me! You may have been tempted by choice (E), because Brian says that his
parents were glad to get rid of him. However, Brian’s statement is contradicted by his father,
who says “unlike your mother and I” (line 37), the other parents they met were glad to part
from their child. The reader has no way of knowing whether Brian or his father is more accu-
rate, so (E) is at best a guess, making choice (A) the winner.
27. Sidney’s character is revealed by all of the following EXCEPT
(A) reactions of other characters to him
(B) his surroundings
(C) physical description
(D) thoughts
(E) actions
Sidney doesn’t do anything in this passage; he doesn’t even talk much. Therefore, choice (E)
is the winner. You can also arrive at the correct answer by eliminating the losers. The other
characters react to Sidney, so (A) is out. Sidney has just arrived at his dorm room, which
doesn’t yet reflect his personality, so you can drop (B). On the other hand, you see quite a 
bit of physical description, including the fact that his skin “flushed hot” (line 46), eliminating
(C). The entire passage is written from Sidney’s point of view, so choice (D) — thoughts —
isn’t the one you want. That leaves you with (E), which is the correct answer.
28. “[W]hat he’d really been thinking about” (line 48) and “their ready agreement to make
no mention of the subject here” (lines 48–49) suggest that
(A) Sidney is ashamed of his upbringing.
(B) Sidney chooses not to reveal something from his past.
(C) Sidney’s mother does not understand her son.
(D) Sidney’s mother does not understand his new environment.
(E) Sidney is uncomfortable with his mother.
Whatever past event Sidney was worrying about, as well as the tacit agreement between
Sidney and his mother not to speak of it, implies that Sidney doesn’t trust that his new room-
mate will accept some aspect of Sidney’s past. Sidney feels the need to hide something,
which his mother apparently knows about. But the relationship between Sidney and his
mother is close. He admires her social skills and isn’t ashamed of his upbringing. Thus
choice (B) is a better answer than (A). The other choices aren’t even close.
29. The tone of the passage is
(A) judgmental
(B) critical
(C) nostalgic
(D) sarcastic
(E) ironic
The passage is written from Sidney’s point of view, and Sidney makes quite a few judgments
about those around him; he doesn’t approve of Mr. Lewis, for example, and he raises his
opinion of his mother as he sees her handle a totally new situation. Sidney isn’t nostalgic or
critical. Sarcasm and irony arise from a gap between what’s said and what’s meant, and these
elements aren’t present here. Thus, the correct answer is (A).
190
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

30. The phrase “Sidney exhaled and realized he hadn’t been breathing at all” (line 52)
implies that he
(A) is nervous in his new surroundings
(B) trusts his mother
(C) is embarrassed by his mother
(D) assumes his mother may reveal a secret
(E) believes that Brian will not like him
Sidney’s rediscovery of breathing shows the tension and worry that he experiences as his
mother speaks about his “sitting on the couch, lost in thought” (line 45). He thinks she may
spill the beans about something, though the reader doesn’t know what. Bingo, choice (D) is
the one you want.

Essay prompt 1 (drama)
The following passage is from Henrik Ibsen’s play An Enemy of the People. In it, Dr.
Stockmann has just discovered that the water in the town spa is tainted. His brother, Peter
Stockmann, is the mayor. Petra is Dr. Stockmann’s daughter. Katherine Stockmann is the
doctor’s wife. After reading the passage carefully, write a well-organized essay exploring how
Ibsen conveys the ethical stance of the characters in this excerpt.
PETRA — Uncle, that is a shameful way to treat a man like father!
MRS. STOCKMANN — Do hold your tongue, Petra!
PETER STOCKMANN [looking at PETRA] — Oh, so we volunteer our opinions
already, do we? Of course. [to MRS STOCKMANN] Katherine, I imagine you are the most
sensible person in this house. Use any influence you may have over your husband, and
make him see what this will entail for his family as well as —
DR. STOCKMANN — My family is my own concern and nobody else’s!
PETER STOCKMANN — for his own family, as I was saying, as well as for the town
he lives in.
DR. STOCKMANN — It is I who have the real good of the town at heart! I want to lay
bare the defects that sooner or later must come to the light of day. I will show whether I
love my native town.
PETER STOCKMANN — You, who in your blind obstinacy want to cut off the most
important source of the town’s welfare?
DR. STOCKMANN — The source is poisoned, man! Are you mad? We are making our
living by retailing filth and corruption! The whole of our flourishing municipal life
derives its sustenance from a lie!
PETER STOCKMANN — All imagination — or something even worse. The man who
can throw out such offensive insinuations about his native town must be an enemy to
our community.
DR. STOCKMANN [going up to him] — Do you dare to — !
MRS. STOCKMANN [throwing herself between them] — Thomas!
PETRA [catching her father by the arm] — Don’t lose your temper, father!

PETER STOCKMANN — I will not expose myself to violence. Now you have had a
warning; so reflect on what you owe to yourself and your family. Goodbye. [goes out]
DR. STOCKMANN [walking up and down] — Am I to put up with such treatment as
this? In my own house, Katherine! What do you think of that!
MRS. STOCKMANN — Indeed it is both shameful and absurd, Thomas —
PETRA — If only I could give uncle a piece of my mind —
DR. STOCKMANN — It is my own fault. I ought to have flown out at him long ago! —
shown my teeth! — bitten! To hear him call me an enemy to our community! Me! I shall
not take that lying down, upon my soul!
MRS. STOCKMANN — But, dear Thomas, your brother has power on his side.
DR. STOCKMANN — Yes, but I have right on mine, I tell you.
MRS. STOCKMANN — Oh yes, right — right. What is the use of having right on your
side if you have not got might?
PETRA — Oh, mother! — how can you say such a thing!
DR. STOCKMANN — Do you imagine that in a free country it is no use having right
on your side? You are absurd, Katherine. Besides, haven’t I got the liberal-minded, inde-
pendent press to lead the way, and the compact majority behind me? That is might
enough, I should think!
MRS. STOCKMANN — But, good heavens, Thomas, you don’t mean to?
DR. STOCKMANN — Don’t mean to what?
MRS. STOCKMANN — To set yourself up in opposition to your brother.
DR. STOCKMANN — In God’s name, what else do you suppose I should do but take
my stand on right and truth?
PETRA — Yes, I was just going to say that.
MRS. STOCKMANN — But it won’t do you any earthly good. If they won’t do it, they
won’t.
DR. STOCKMANN — Oh no, Katherine! Just give me time, and you will see how I will
carry the war into their camp.
MRS. STOCKMANN — Yes, you carry the war into their camp, and you get your 
dismissal — that is what you will do.
DR. STOCKMANN — In any case I shall have done my duty towards the public —
towards the community, I, who am called its enemy!
MRS. STOCKMANN — But towards your family, Thomas? Towards your own home!
Do you think that is doing your duty towards those you have to provide for?
PETRA — Ah, don’t think always first of us, mother.
MRS. STOCKMANN — Oh, it is easy for you to talk; you are able to shift for yourself, if
need be. But remember the boys, Thomas; and think a little of yourself too, and of me —
Essay prompt 2 (nonfiction)
Read this passage carefully and, in a well-organized essay, analyze the literary devices the
author employs to make the setting both reflect and emphasize the changes in the family.
The next morning we made the last stage of our journey, our hearts filled with the
joy of nearing our new home. We all had an idea that we were going to a farm, and we
expected some resemblance at least to the prosperous farms we had seen in New
England. My mother’s mental picture was, naturally, of an English farm. Possibly she had
visions of red barns and deep meadows, sunny skies and daisies. What we found await-
ing us were the four walls and the roof of a good-sized log-house, standing in a small
cleared strip of the wilderness, its doors and windows represented by square holes, its
floor also a thing of the future, its whole effect achingly forlorn and desolate. It was late
in the afternoon when we drove up to the opening that was its front entrance, and I shall
never forget the look my mother turned upon the place. Without a word she crossed its
threshold, and, standing very still, looked slowly around her. Then something within her
seemed to give way, and she sank upon the ground. She could not realize even then, I
think, that this was really the place father had prepared for us, that here he expected us
to live. When she finally took it in she buried her face in her hands, and in that way she

sat for hours without moving or speaking. For the first time in her life she had forgotten
us; and we, for our part, dared not speak to her. We stood around her in a frightened
group, talking to one another in whispers. Our little world had crumbled under our feet.
Never before had we seen our mother give way to despair.
Night began to fall. The woods became alive with night creatures, and the most
harmless made the most noise. The owls began to hoot, and soon we heard the wildcat,
whose cry — a screech like that of a lost and panic-stricken child — is one of the most
appalling sounds of the forest. Later the wolves added their howls to the uproar, but
though darkness came and we children whimpered around her, our mother still sat in
her strange lethargy.
At last my brother brought the horses close to the cabin and built fires to protect
them and us. He was only twenty, but he showed himself a man during those early pio-
neer days. While he was picketing the horses and building his protecting fires my
mother came to herself, but her face when she raised it was worse than her silence had
been. She seemed to have died and to have returned to us from the grave, and I am sure
she felt that she had done so. From that moment she took up again the burden of her
life, a burden she did not lay down until she passed away; but her face never lost the
deep lines those first hours of her pioneer life had cut upon it.
That night we slept on boughs spread on the earth inside the cabin walls, and we
put blankets before the holes which represented our doors and windows, and kept our
watch-fires burning. Soon the other children fell asleep, but there was no sleep for me. I
was only twelve years old, but my mind was full of fancies. Behind our blankets, swaying
in the night wind, I thought I saw the heads and pushing shoulders of animals and heard
their padded footfalls. Later years brought familiarity with wild things, and with worse
things than they. But tonight that which I most feared was within, not outside of, the
cabin. In some way which I did not understand the one sure refuge in our new world had
been taken from us. I hardly knew the silent woman who lay near me, tossing from side
to side and staring into the darkness; I felt that we had lost our mother.
Essay prompt 3 (fiction)
Read this excerpt from Sinclair Lewis’s novel Main Street. In a well-written essay, discuss how
this scene reveals societal norms. Do not limit yourself to plot summary.
Even while they were removing their overshoes they were peeping at the new deco-
rations. Carol saw Dave Dyer secretively turn over the gold pillows to find a price-tag,
and heard Mr. Julius Flickerbaugh, the attorney, gasp, “Well, I’ll be switched,” as he
viewed the vermilion print hanging against the Japanese obi. She was amused. But her
high spirits slackened as she beheld them form in dress parade, in a long, silent, uneasy
circle clear round the living-room. She felt that she had been magically whisked back to
her first party, at Sam Clark’s.
“Have I got to lift them, like so many pigs of iron? I don’t know that I can make them
happy, but I’ll make them hectic.”
A silver flame in the darkling circle, she whirled around, drew them with her smile,
and sang, “I want my party to be noisy and undignified! This is the christening of my
house, and I want you to help me have a bad influence on it, so that it will be a giddy
house. For me, won’t you all join in an old-fashioned square dance? And Mr. Dyer will call.”
She had a record on the phonograph; Dave Dyer was capering in the center of the
floor, loose-jointed, lean, small, rusty headed, pointed of nose, clapping his hands and
shouting, “Swing y’ pardners — alamun lef!”
Even the millionaire Dawsons and Ezra Stowbody and “Professor” George Edwin
Mott danced, looking only slightly foolish; and by rushing about the room and being coy
and coaxing to all persons over forty-five, Carol got them into a waltz and a Virginia
Reel. But when she left them to disenjoy themselves in their own way Harry Haydock
put a one-step record on the phonograph, the younger people took the floor, and all the
elders sneaked back to their chairs, with crystallized smiles which meant, “Don’t believe
I’ll try this one myself, but I do enjoy watching the youngsters dance.”

Half of them were silent; half resumed the discussions of that afternoon in the store.
Ezra Stowbody hunted for something to say, hid a yawn, and offered to Lyman Cass, 
the owner of the flour-mill, “How’d you folks like the new furnace, Lym? Huh? So.”
“Oh, let them alone. Don’t pester them. They must like it, or they wouldn’t do it.”
Carol warned herself. But they gazed at her so expectantly when she flickered past that
she was reconvinced that in their debauches of respectability they had lost the power
of play as well as the power of impersonal thought. Even the dancers were gradually
crushed by the invisible force of fifty perfectly pure and well-behaved and negative
minds; and they sat down, two by two. In twenty minutes the party was again elevated
to the decorum of a prayer-meeting.
“We’re going to do something exciting,” Carol exclaimed to her new confidante, 
Vida Sherwin. She saw that in the growing quiet her voice had carried across the room.
Nat Hicks, Ella Stowbody, and Dave Dyer were abstracted, fingers and lips slightly
moving. She knew with a cold certainty that Dave was rehearsing his “stunt” about the
Norwegian catching the hen, Ella running over the first lines of “An Old Sweetheart of
Mine,” and Nat thinking of his popular parody on Mark Antony’s oration.
“But I will not have anybody use the word ‘stunt’ in my house,” she whispered to
Miss Sherwin.
“That’s good. I tell you: why not have Raymond Wutherspoon sing?”
“Raymie? Why, my dear, he’s the most sentimental yearner in town!”
“See here, child! Your opinions on house-decorating are sound, but your opinions of
people are rotten! Raymie does wag his tail. But the poor dear’ — ‘Longing for what he
calls ‘self-expression’ and no training in anything except selling shoes. But he can sing.
And some day when he gets away from Harry Haydock’s patronage and ridicule, he’ll do
something fine.”
Carol apologized for her superciliousness. She urged Raymie, and warned the plan-
ners of “stunts,” “We all want you to sing, Mr. Wutherspoon. You’re the only famous
actor I’m going to let appear on the stage tonight.”
While Raymie blushed and admitted, “Oh, they don’t want to hear me,” he was
clearing his throat, pulling his clean handkerchief farther out of his breast pocket, and
thrusting his fingers between the buttons of his vest.
Answer Guide for Prose and Drama Essays
Hello, all you creative people out there! How do I know you’re creative? Because you’re read-
ing a For Dummies book and not some other boring AP practice volume. I can’t come to your
house to read your essay (though if you offer me an ice cream sundae with caramel sauce, I’ll
make an effort). So in this answer guide, I explain the basic elements that every grader looks
for. Then I provide a list of points you might make about each selection, which is pretty much
everything I can think of about each passage. When you take the AP English exam, you can
score a five without including all the ideas on my list. Also, you may come up with something
I neglected to include. Good for you! Just be sure you can justify your idea with evidence
from the passage.
General essay requirements
Here are the basic elements that every AP essay grader looks for:
 The essay needs an introduction containing the name of the author and the title of the
literary work (assuming you have that information). The title of a novel or a play
should be underlined. Story titles are enclosed in quotation marks.
The essay prompt helps you deal with the punctuation needed for a title. If the AP writ-
ers used quotation marks, so should you. If the title is italicized, you should underline it.
194

 The introductory paragraph should contain a thesis statement. (Chapter 3 explains
how to create a thesis statement.)
 The essay needs to be organized logically. You can proceed through the passage in line
order, making a point about each significant item. Or, you can group similar ideas, with
everything about a particular character in one paragraph, for example.
 Ideally the essay should have a conclusion, not a summary or an abrupt stop.
 The essay must include evidence, in the form of quotations, from the selection. The
quotations should be punctuated properly. You can cite line numbers in parentheses
after the quotations, but you don’t have to do so.
 The essay should be written in present tense, unless you need to indicate an order of
events. Here’s an example: “As the play begins, Macbeth is praised for his courage. The
captain describes how Macbeth defeated the rebels.” “Defeated” is in past tense to
show that the praise takes place after the battle.
 You should have a minimum number of grammar and spelling errors. Be sure to use
complete sentences, each ending with a period or a question mark. Stay away from
exclamation points, which are out of place in a literary essay.
 You should check, check, and then recheck that you’re answering the question the
prompt asks. Off-topic remarks should be crossed out. Stay focused!
Potential points for essay 1
I chose Ibsen’s play because it’s often cited on the AP exam as one of the works to analyze in
the third, open-ended essay question. The AP writers like this play for very good reason: The
characters’ interactions are more subtle than they first appear, and the overall conflict is
compelling and relevant to current issues. It’s a great play; I suggest that you read all of it
when you have some extra time.
Main points
The prompt asks you to analyze “how Ibsen conveys the ethical stance of the characters.”
Therefore, your first task is to define each character’s views of right and wrong. Here are
some of the general ideas:
 Peter Stockmann is pragmatic, and if he has any ethics, he’s willing to ignore them
because he wants the town’s economy to survive. He doesn’t care that the water may
be dangerous in the long run. He’s thinking about the here and now. Lying isn’t a prob-
lem for Peter.
 Dr. Stockmann sees the world in absolute terms. The water is tainted, and therefore he
has to disclose that fact, regardless of personal cost.
 Petra backs her father. Right is right and wrong is wrong. End of story.
 Katherine Stockmann’s primary concern is her family’s welfare. She’s practical rather
than idealistic. She thinks that Dr. Stockmann will lose if he battles the mayor. She also
thinks that her husband should be loyal to the mayor because the mayor is family. For
her, “family values” isn’t a cliché but an ethical imperative.
Evidence
After you understand who believes what, zero in on how those beliefs are portrayed, the
most important part of the prompt. Simply reporting the basic ethical stance of each charac-
ter won’t earn you much credit. Identifying the way in which Ibsen conveys each character’s
ethical stances is more impressive, but it’s also tougher. You can’t just note that he uses dia-
logue. After all, it’s a play! But analyzing the stage directions and the punctuation in this
selection turns an okay-but-not-great essay into a wow-listen-to-this-answer essay.

Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

Here’s the evidence dealing with dialogue:
 Peter Stockmann acknowledges the doctor’s duty to his family (“see what this will
entail for his family,” line 6), but his attention is focused on the town (“for the town he
lives in,” lines 8–9). He adds that his brother’s “blind obstinacy” (line 13) will “cut off
the most important source of the town’s welfare” (lines 13–14). He condemns his
brother as “an enemy to our community” (lines 19–20).
 Dr. Stockmann is repelled by the fact that “our flourishing municipal life derives its sus-
tenance from a lie!” (lines 16–17). However, his comments also show that his ethical
stance is mixed with something else — competition with his brother. Dr. Stockmann
says, “Am I to put up with such treatment as this?” (lines 26–27) and challenges his
brother: “Do you dare to — ” (line 21). Dr. Stockmann tells his wife that he should have
“shown [his] teeth” (line 31) long ago. Mostly, however, he rests on moral certainty: “I
have right on [my side]” (line 34). He believes that the press and the majority will back
him as he says, “That is might enough” (lines 40–41). He declares, “[I] take my stand on
right and truth” (lines 45–46).
 Katherine Stockmann challenges her daughter, trying to keep peace in the family: “Do
hold your tongue, Petra” (line 2). She also supports her husband when he complains
that he has been attacked in his own home: “Indeed it is both shameful and absurd”
(line 28). However, she fears the consequences of her husband’s stance (“What is the
use of having right on your side if you have not got might?” lines 35–36, and “you get
your dismissal,” lines 52–53). She emphasizes family: “To set yourself up in opposition
to your brother” (line 44) and “towards your family . . . your own home!” (line 56). She
reminds her husband that he must think of “the boys . . . and of me” (line 60).
 Petra berates her uncle, saying her uncle’s treatment of her father is “shameful” (line
1). She dismisses her mother: “[H]ow can you say such a thing?” (line 37) and “[D]on’t
always think of us first, Mother” (line 58). She praises her father: “I was just going to
say that” (line 47).
Here are some lines of evidence you might use regarding the stage directions:
 The mayor appeals to the women, looking at Petra and Mrs. Stockmann (lines 3–4).
 The doctor confronts his brother physically, “going up to him” (line 21).
 Mrs. Stockmann is so anxious to make peace that she is described as “throwing herself
between” the men (line 22).
Here are some ideas you can bring up regarding punctuation:
 All the dashes, indicating unfinished thoughts, are important. An unfinished thought
may show hesitation or conflict. Or, if another character jumps in, the dash may dis-
play the unity between two characters or their impatience.
 The mayor, interrupted in line 6, goes back to his original thought in line 8 as if the
interruption had not happened. The dashes indicate here that he’s obstinate; the 
interruption won’t slow him down.
 The dashes show changes of thought or increased emotion. In lines 30–31, for example,
the doctor says “I ought to have flown out at him long ago! — shown my teeth! — bitten!”
 The dash in line 35 between “right” and “right” reveals Mrs. Stockmann’s ambivalence.
She wants to support her husband’s views, but she questions his definition of right
because it may hurt her family.
 The many exclamation points throughout the passage intensify the emotions of the
characters. Petra, for example, says, “Oh, mother! — how can you say such a thing!”
(line 37).

Organization
The essay may be organized in a couple of ways. You can devote one paragraph to each char-
acter, perhaps combining Petra and her father, as their views are similar. Or, you can devote
one paragraph to dialogue, one to stage directions, and one to punctuation.
Overall assessment
Overall, rate your essay as “poor’ if all you did was identify the main ethical stance of each
character. Move yourself to “fair” if you captured the complexity of Mrs. Stockmann’s and 
Dr. Stockmann’s views. These ideas, of course, have to be supported by quotations from the
dialogue. Step into the “good” category if you mentioned stage directions and punctuation,
perhaps making two or three points about these elements. The exam graders will also take
into account how well you’ve organized and presented the information, so be sure your
essay is logical and well written. (For more details on scoring an essay, take a look at 
Chapter 17 or Chapter 19, where I present scoring grids for essay questions.
Potential points for essay 2
This selection describes the brutal homecoming of a pioneer family to a homestead prepared
by the father. The details of the family’s living conditions and reactions take you right into
this scene. As soon as you’re immersed in the scene, you realize that the setting is only a 
way to tell you what’s going on in the family.
Main points
The prompt asks you to explain how the setting works to “reflect and emphasize the changes
in the family.” You can make several points about the setting and the family:
 The setting is a wilderness in which the father of the family has built a cabin. No spe-
cific time period is identified, though the family is clearly in the “pioneer” category.
 The mother experiences a mini–nervous breakdown in this scene. Her strength and
confidence seem to desert her as she views her new living conditions. Eventually, she
accepts her fate.
 The brother rises to a new level of maturity and responsibility as the mother becomes
incapacitated.
 The narrator loses her innocence, realizing that her mother doesn’t have all the
answers. This new idea makes the narrator fearful.
Evidence
This prompt is a complicated one because it requires you to deal with three elements: the
changes in the family, the setting, and the literary devices that convey the setting. To write a
really good essay, you also have to link these three elements and use evidence to prove how
the setting mirrors the changes in the family.
Here’s evidence you can use regarding changes in the family:
 The mother breaks down by “standing very still” (line 11) as she first enters her new
home and having “something within her . . . give way” (lines 11–12) as she collapses.
She sits “for hours” (line 15) and “buried her face in her hands” (line 14). The narrator
says that “[f]or the first time in her life she had forgotten us” (line 15). When the
mother begins to function again, she “seemed to have died and to have returned to us
from the grave” (line 29). She now carries “a burden she did not lay down until she
passed away” (line 31), and her face “never lost the deep lines those first hours of pio-
neer life had cut upon it” (lines 31–32).
197
Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

 The children change also. At first, they “stood around her in a frightened group, talking
to one another in whispers” (lines 16–17). The children’s “little world had crumbled”
(line 17) from the sight of their mother’s despair, and they “whimpered around her” at
nightfall (line 23). However, the brother finally takes charge, bringing the horses closer
to the house; he “showed himself a man during those early pioneer days” (lines 26–27).
The narrator is sleepless, explaining that “we had lost our mother” (line 42).
You can use the following ideas as evidence for showing how the author conveys the setting:
 The events take place during “pioneer days” in a wilderness setting. The location is 
not disclosed, but the house is contrasted with “prosperous farms . . . in New England”
(lines 3–4) and “an English farm” (line 4). It’s late afternoon when the family arrives
(lines 8–9).
 The “good-sized log-house” (line 6) has only walls and a roof. The windows are open
“square holes” and the floor is “a thing of the future” (line 8). The family sleeps on
“boughs spread on the earth” (line 33) with blankets over the windows and door.
 The natural world is threatening. The “woods became alive with night creatures” 
(line 19), with owls and wildcats and wolves crying in the night.
The following are lines of evidence regarding literary devices:
 In describing the imagined setting, the author selects details that create an idyllic
scene — “red barns and deep meadows, sunny skies and daisies” (line 5). These details
emphasize the idyllic view the children have of their mother. She’s strong and unbreak-
able, they think. That strength means that her breakdown is all the more shocking 
to them.
 The hyperbole in line 17 (“our little world had crumbled under our feet”) matches the
earthen floor of the house.
 The diction is plain; all the words are simple and the syntax is natural. The diction 
and syntax emphasize the plainness of the house and the naturalness of the change in
the family. All children, at some point, realize that their parents aren’t all-powerful.
 The simile in line 21 (“a screech like that of a lost and panic-stricken child”) expresses
what the children are going through. Also, the wolves howl, just as the children 
whimper.
 The boughs (line 33) symbolize the family’s entry into nature. They’re in the wilder-
ness, and again, the children realize that their mother isn’t the rock they thought she
was — a natural part of their maturation process.
Organization
Putting all the necessary information together into one essay isn’t easy. You can structure
the essay by devoting one paragraph to family changes, one to setting, and one to literary
devices. Or, you can split the essay into two sections, devoting one part to the mother and
her changes and another to the children and their maturation. In each of these sections you
would include the literary devices and refer to elements of the setting that you encounter,
taking care to relate those elements and devices to each other and to the characters’
changes.
Overall assessment
A good essay in response to this prompt should include comments about the mother, the
children, and the setting, plus at least two or three points about literary devices (all with
supporting evidence from the passage). A fair or poor essay lacks some of these elements
and fails to support the main ideas. I’ve included a ton of quotations, but if you have half as
many as I do, you’ve written a good response. And of course, don’t forget that you need to
express yourself clearly and fluently to impress an AP grader.

Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Potential points for essay 3
This prompt is your invitation to Carol’s party, and what a drag that party appears to be! The
prompt sends you inside the society, where your mission is to figure out what the norms are.
As usual in an AP exam prompt, a super-important word here is “how.” When you’re in “how”
territory, you’re looking for writing techniques, the infamous literary devices.
This prompt, like many AP prompts, specifically tells you to avoid plot summary. Why? The
exam graders don’t want to read that Carol gave a party at which the guests danced, sneaked
looks at price tags, had boring conversations, and then listened to somebody perform
karaoke without the music. The graders know all that. Instead, they want you to use the
information from the passage to answer the question.
Main points
An essay in response to this prompt should deal with individual characterization (action, dia-
logue, thoughts, description, diction, figurative language, point of view, and so forth), espe-
cially of Carol, who’s the most important character. She’s set up in opposition to the group;
she’s the punk rocker of her society. (Okay, maybe not a punk, but she is a rebel.) The party
guests, in turn, serve as a foil for Carol; they have different values and traditions. Analyze the
way in which the characters interact, and take a long look at the few, but important, physical
details of the setting. (And they say the AP exam is no fun . . .)
Evidence
Now for some specifics. I’ve divided these points into two camps — one for Carol and one for
everyone else. Interspersed are some specific literary devices you may mention.
Here are the points of evidence for Carol’s characterization:
 Carol sees herself as superior to her guests, but she feels responsible for changing
their behavior — a heavy burden. “Have I got to lift them, like so many pigs of iron?”
she asks (line 8). She whirls around and demands that her party be “undignified” 
(line 11), implying that serious behavior is the norm.
 Carol “sang” (line 11) and “exclaimed” (line 34) rather than “said” or “spoke.” This
word choice contrasts her liveliness with the dullness of the other people. Her varia-
tion from the norm helps indentify rules that the others obey.
 Carol is described as a “silver flame in a darkling circle” (line 10). The circle is dark and
joyless; again, this metaphor indicates that having fun is the exception, not the rule in
this society. “Darkling” implies nightfall, the end of something. The society is on its way
out; it’s already dead in some ways, and Carol is trying to liven it up.
 She asks her guests to be “a bad influence” on her house (line 12). The house is sym-
bolically tied to Carol, who wants to be “bad” but with group support.
 Carol “flickered past” the guests (line 28). The word choice (diction) here depicts her
as a flame (fire flickers), dangerous but also bringing light and heat to the town.
The following is evidence for the characterization of other characters:
 Discretion seems to be important in this society. The guests are “peeping at the new
decorations” (lines 1–2), and Dave Dyer “secretively” looks for price tags (line 2).
 Money is a big deal; people want to know how much you’re worth. For example, Dave
Dyer tries to find out how much Carol spent on her pillows, and the Dawsons are
described as “millionaires” (line 17).
199
Chapter 13: Practice Makes Perfect: Prose and Drama Questions

 Conformity rules. The decorations feature a “vermilion print” (line 4) and a “Japanese
obi” (line 4). The obi, a sash, shocks the guests; Mr. Julius Flickerbaugh gasps when he
sees it and says, “Well, I’ll be switched” (line 3). Obviously anything new is a surprise in
this social group. “Switched” is an interesting word choice. He’s almost saying that the
surprise makes him become someone else.
The guests enter in “dress parade” (line 5) and form a “long, silent, uneasy circle” 
(lines 5–-6). The military metaphor and the description of the seating arrangement 
reinforce the conformity of this society.
 When Carol leaves, the guests “disenjoy themselves” (line 20). Later the guests are 
said to have “lost the power of play as well as the power of impersonal thought” 
(lines 29–30). In this group, fun is off limits, as are new ideas.
 Carol sees her guests as having “debauches of respectability” (line 29). A “debauch” 
is usually an out-of-control event such as a keg party or an orgy. Here the debauch is
respectable. In other words, frat-party guests get drunk on beer; these guests get drunk
on “respectability,” which appears to be a synonym for their nearly joyless lives.
 The dancers are gradually crushed by “the invisible force of fifty perfectly pure and
well-behaved and negative minds” (lines 31–32), and the party becomes a “prayer-
meeting” (line 33). “Pure,” “well-behaved,” and “prayer-meeting” are normally good
labels, but here they’re linked with “negative” (line 31). These people are pure because
they won’t allow anything to happen.
 Appearances are important among this conservative crowd. The dancers are said to 
be “looking only slightly foolish” (line 18), but the guests have “crystallized smiles”
(line 22). That metaphor emphasizes the unchanging, stolid character of the group. 
In the same vein, the guests talk with “lips slightly moving” (lines 36–37).
 The guests value conformity to the unvarying rituals and conversations they’re used
to. Ezra Stowbody “hunted for something to say” (line 25), and many guests resume
conversations they had started earlier in the day.
 Self-expression and individuality are no-nos. Vida Sherwin tells Carol that Raymie is
“longing for what he calls ‘self-expression’” (lines 45–46). The quotation marks around 
“self-expression” distance Raymie from that sentiment. She’s more likely to see “self-
expression” as “self-indulgence.” However, Vida has some affection for Raymie, expect-
ing him to “do something fine” (lines 47–48) when he’s removed from the bad influence
of another member of the group.
Organization
This prompt asks for a lot of information, and so organizing all of it — or even some of it! —
is tough. To make the task easier, you can divide the essay in these ways:
 One body paragraph for Carol and one for everyone else. This structure is easy, but
you have a lot to cram into two paragraphs. Still, it could work.
 One body paragraph for each norm you identify: conformity, respectability, money,
appearances, and so forth. (There are a lot of possibilities; you may find only three or
four depending on how you define the categories.) This structure is more sophisticated
and therefore more impressive, but you have to get organized fast to place everything
in the right spot.
 The fastest way to tackle this prompt is to devote one body paragraph to each section
of the story. The first body paragraph covers the guests’ arrival, the second discusses
the dancing, and the third handles the conversation (or lack thereof) and singing. The
problem with this organizational structure is that you have to keep moving back and
forth between Carol and the others. Plus, you have to find a way to include evidence
for the same societal norm without repeating yourself.
200
Part III: Getting the Story from Prose and Drama 

Avoid repetition not only because you lack time but also because reading the same
thing twice is B-O-R-I-N-G. If you discuss money in the first body paragraph, when Dave
turns the pillows over, don’t say the same thing about money later, when the Dawsons
are described as millionaires.
Overall assessment
If you recognized all the points that I listed for this essay, you should drop out of school and
take my job. I spent a long time gathering these points — far longer than those measly 40
minutes you have on the AP exam. If you correctly characterized three or four of the societal
norms (conformity, deadening respectability, money, appearances, and all other possibili-
ties) and if you made six or seven supporting points, you’re in good shape. You don’t need
fancy labels (metaphor, diction, and the like), but literary terminology does enhance your
essay. However, it’s only a positive addition if you analyze the impact of each element that
you identify.

F
igure skating routines are designed by the contes-
tants, who skate to music of their choice. This aspect
of skating is similar to the open-ended question, the third
and last AP English Literature and Composition exam
essay. The open-ended question comes without a literary
passage. You choose a work to write about in response to
a question that the College Board supplies.
Another aspect of figure skating is the pairs competition,
in which twirling couples compete with gravity-defying
leaps and tight spins. Sometimes the AP English exam has
a pairs competition too. In this case, the trophy is a 9 (the
highest essay score). The slippery surface you’re working
on consists of two literary selections, side by side, and a
prompt that asks you to compare and contrast them in
a well-written essay. Let me guess! You’d probably rather
slide into the wall of the rink than work on such an essay?
Never fear. In this part, I show you how to train for these

magine how it feels to loosen your tie or slip out of your high heels. That’s what the
open-ended essay feels like: a bit of sweet freedom. Only a bit, though! You’re still taking
an exam. But after you arrive at the third, open-ended essay question, you’re free from the
literary passages that the College Board plopped in front of you for the first and second
essay questions. Instead, the open-ended essay hits you with a prompt and a list of perhaps
30 titles. You respond to the prompt by discussing a work from the list or something “of
comparable quality.” Ah, the sweet freedom of choice.
However, not so fast. Freedom isn’t all fun and games. As philosophers have often pointed
out, with freedom comes responsibility. Choosing the right text can be a make-or-break deci-
sion. Also, analyzing a literary work that isn’t in front of you presents unique challenges.
Not to worry, though. In this chapter, I explain everything you need to know about the open-
ended essay, from prompt decoding and text selection to evidence collection. I also go into
detail on how to arm yourself for AP English Literature and Composition exam with prepared
material — enough information on four or five literary works to cover nearly all possible
prompts. (Just for the record, I’m talking about mental preparation, not notes etched on your
contact lenses.) I also show you a good open-ended essay, so you can visualize the goal.
Preparing Literary Works for AP Use
Put yourself in this scene: You’re sitting in a classroom, sweat dripping slowly onto a desk,
working your way through the two-hour endurance test known as the essay section of the AP
English Literature and Composition exam. You turn to the open-ended prompt. You read it,
figure out what the exam writers actually want to know, and search your memory bank and
the list of suggested works for something suitable to write about. You come up with
absolutely nothing. Nada. Zippo.
Nightmare time, right? Fortunately, it’s a scenario that never has to happen. Why? Because
before exam day arrives, you can prepare four or five literary works that ride to your rescue
no matter what questions the AP writers dream up. Here’s the secret: AP open-ended ques-
tions tend to focus on large, somewhat hazy (though still important) ideas. Handily, great
works of literature also tend to deal with large, somewhat hazy (though still important)
ideas. So the odds are one or more of your prepared works will make a match.

Adhering to standards of literary quality
No, you can’t get credit for writing about your favorite Dr. Seuss book, as one daring but mis-
guided student tried to do a few years ago. The College Board wants to evaluate how well
you understand and write about serious literature. Therefore they expect you to analyze a
full-length, unified work that contains these elements:
 Layers of meaning: Not every idea in the work comes across after a brief skim-read.
Good literature rewards attention and offers something new every time you read it.
 Important issues: If the only topic covered in the work is whether the ideal prom date
is available, you can be sure that you’re not in serious literature territory. Important
issues include art, war, love, mortality, truth, and other such topics.
Sometimes a book that appears to deal only with trivial issues actually addresses univer-
sal human situations. Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse, for example, contains a scene 
in which the characters eat dinner and chat about nothing. In one corner of the table,
however, a young woman moves a salt shaker and silverware. The character’s thoughts
roam from the role of art to the pressure on an artist to conform to society’s expectations
to gender roles and a lot more. Don’t shy away from works that seem to tackle everyday
life. Just be sure that the work addresses important issues on some level.
 Fully-developed characters: The minor characters may display only one personality
trait, but the important characters need to embody complexity, as real people do.
 Adult-level vocabulary and sentence structure: The AP program offers college 
credit, so not surprisingly it expects you to read college-level material. Unless the
writer has created a narrator who speaks simply, look for difficult words and compli-
cated sentences.
The full-length-only rule has one advantage: it takes the mystery away from title punctuation.
The titles of full-length works — novels, plays, book-sized poems — are underlined, not placed
inside quotation marks. However, if you merit special accommodations and are typing your AP
essay (see Chapter 1 for more information), you may italicize the title instead of underlining it.
Staying on the safe side
If you don’t enjoy gambling, which is probably the best attitude for an AP exam, you can feel
safe and confident when you choose one of the following types of works for your essay:
 Anything you studied in English class: If you spent six weeks on a particular work in a
high-level English class (11th or 12th grade), it’s a good bet that you can use that work
on the AP exam. However, proceed at your own risk if it’s something you read in tenth
grade or earlier.
 Classics: These are the titles you’ve heard a million times (Pride and Prejudice, Moby-
Dick, or King Lear). They come in special editions with plain but dignified covers. Not
sure if the one you’ve chosen is a classic? Check Appendix A for a list of classics and
worthy newer works.
 Anything from the list provided on the exam: If the exam writers tell you that
Important Novel or Classic Play is a possible choice, you can be sure that it’s super-safe.
As my students put it, duh!
If you’re writing about a book that has been made into a movie, be extremely careful to write
only about the book. Ignore the movie completely! Hollywood often destroys (sorry, adapts)
literature. One horrifying example is Bernard Malamud’s novel The Natural, which concerns 
a baseball player. The book is serious; the player is a flawed hero who often makes poor
choices and has to suffer the consequences. At the end of the book (spoiler alert here!), the
baseball player strikes out at a crucial moment. In the movie, however, he hits a home run,
which is filmed in slow motion with inspiring background music. Writing about that (inaccu-
rate) cinematic moment — as a student of mine once did — can seriously annoy any teacher
or AP exam grader who expects you to read and write about the text, not the film.
206
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

Taking a chance
Are you the creative type who would rather score a low grade than compromise your
integrity? Okay, I’m not going to argue with you. Just remember that you may be able to do
well with one of the following types of literature, but these choices are definitely risky:
 Recent books or plays: It takes a while for literature to work its way into what teacher-
types call “the canon” of English literature. After all, when a new work appears, some
people like it, some love it, some are indifferent, and some ignore it completely
because they refuse to read anything published after the 19th century. (A couple of
people I know are in that category.) Thus, even if the book was published to “critical
acclaim,” as the jacket blurb brags, the grader may not consider it a worthy choice.
If you do go off the beaten path, you risk writing about a work that the grader hasn’t
read. The AP Graders-in-Chief have a strategy for such cases; they try to give that exam
to someone who’s familiar with the work. I have a strategy for you also; read the later
section “Detecting and Selecting Evidence” for information on how to deal with plot
points in an essay about lesser-known literature.
 Young adult works: An unfair fact of life is that books perceived as children’s or
“young adult” literature seldom get the respect they deserve (despite the fact that
quite a few books devoured by not-old-enough-to-vote people are worthy of your atten-
tion and analysis). On the AP exam, however, such titles as Alice in Wonderland and
The Secret Garden may not make the cut.
 Graphic novels: I’m not a particularly visual person, but I appreciate serious graphic
novels, which convey meaning through drawings and text. For instance, I loved reading
Art Spiegelman’s Maus, an account of a Holocaust survivor and his son, as well as
Marjane Satrapi’s Persepolis, which deals with her childhood in Iran. However, some
English teachers look down on graphic novels, mistakenly viewing them as souped-up
comic books. Also, because you’re proving that you can handle text, not pictures, you
may not be able to discuss the work adequately in the context of an AP exam.
 Novellas: A novella is shorter than a novel but generally just as complex as the longer
work. You’re in a gray area if you opt for a novella because the essay prompt generally
asks you to write about a novel or play. However, the AP often lists a few novellas, such
as Franz Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, so sometimes the graders do approve of these
shorter works.
Don’t go there
A few types of writing send your essay right off a cliff (without a parachute). Avoid these
works at all cost:
 Short stories: Even a collection of short stories is a bad idea for the open-ended essay.
The exam writers are looking for analysis of a full-length, unified work. In fact, the
prompt often specifically rules out short stories.
 Poems: In general you aren’t allowed to write about poems in response to the open-
ended question. The prompt sometimes states that poems should be avoided. One
exception: You may write about a book-length poem or a play written in verse, such 
as Homer’s Odyssey or Dante’s Divine Comedy. As long as you choose a classic, book-
length poems or verse plays are great subjects for the open-ended essay.
 Non-print works: No films, no television shows, no song lyrics, no operas, and no blogs.
 Non-published works: If your Uncle Oscar wrote the best play ever, you can’t write
about it unless it’s in print. How would the graders evaluate your work? You can’t rely

English teacher or two in the audience.

Choosing works to prepare
When choosing works to prepare for the AP exam, your goal is to have four or five arrows
ready to fire. (Each arrow is one literary work, either a novel or a play or a book-length
poem.) The basic principle is simple: Go for variety.
If your favorite books are Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, and Persuasion, you can claim
membership in the Jane Austen fan club. (I’m a life member.) And with these three works pre-
pared, you’re all set if the open-ended prompt concerns societal norms, male-female or parent-
child conflicts, comedy, or coming-of-age stories. But if the prompt asks you to consider the
effect of a tragic hero on the people surrounding him or her — a real AP question one year —
you’re in trouble if you have nothing prepared other than these novels. As much as I love Jane,
even I have to admit that she was right when she called her writing “a little bit . . . of Ivory, on
which I work with so fine a Brush.” In other words, her scope was definitely narrow.
Variety, in literary terms, means works containing different issues, types of characters, situa-
tions, and themes. (Turn to Appendix A for a list of great literary works and some informa-
tion on their content and themes.) When choosing four or five works to prepare, I suggest
that you have at least one from each of the following categories:
 Tragedy: This work may be either a play or a novel or a book-length poem, but it
should be a tragedy in the classical sense, featuring a flawed hero or heroine who suf-
fers partly through his or her own actions.
 Comedy: Comedy doesn’t always get the attention it deserves, but it may deal as seri-
ously with the human condition as tragedy does. Sometimes it’s the best choice for an
open-ended essay question.
 One novel and one play: Frequently the same question may be answered by either a
prose or a dramatic work, but if you have one of each ready to go, you won’t be caught
short.
 Works not written by a dead white male (DWM): Okay, before you start screaming at
me, let me admit that Shakespeare’s work includes just about any issue you can think
of, and old Will is one of the deadest, whitest, male writers you can find. Plenty of other
DWMs are amazing also. However, diversity in your reading and in your AP preparation
is still a good idea. Why? Well, for one, you encounter some great literature if you move
beyond DWMs, and you also may find some AP questions easier to answer with works
not from the DWM category. For example, in recent years, many AP questions have
dealt with a character who’s outside of mainstream society, either for cultural or per-
sonal reasons. Other open-ended questions have addressed stereotypes, opposition to
society, and social or political change.
 A work that you love: Every once in a while you fall under the spell of a book, and it
becomes part of who you are. If a work makes you passionate, you can write about it
with passion too. Keep in mind this well-known formula: passion equals a good essay.
Some of these categories overlap. A tragedy may also be a play, for example. Just be sure you
end up with four or five varied, ready-to-rumble works. Then you’re all set. Turn to Chapter 3
for an explanation of how to keep track of works that might be suitable for the open-ended
essay.
Compiling notes on your chosen works
Unless you have a photographic memory, you’ve probably forgotten a lot of details from the
books you read in previous school years or even from the current year. Luckily for the non-
memorizers out there, notes help you keep track of Mr. Darcy, Celie, Fortinbras, Estella, and
all the other wonderful characters in literature, along with their exploits. This section
explains how to compile notes that will help you on the exam.

Recording the must-have info
When recording the important information from a work, your goal is to know the following
specifics cold:
 Title, author, names of all major characters and some significant minor characters
 Setting
 Important events in the plot
 Themes and symbols
 Significant quotations
Don’t try to memorize a ton of quotations. Aim for one or two quotations from each work or
none at all if you have a lot of trouble memorizing. It’s better to paraphrase than to quote
badly. The graders don’t want to read your thoughts on “Hamlet’s soliloquy about ‘being or
not being.’”
Flip to Chapter 3 for guidance on preparing good notes, and see the yellow tear-out card at
the front of the book for a blank note-taking form.
No shortcuts! Don’t read an online or printed summary of a book rather than the book itself.
It’s fairly easy for an experienced English teacher — a category that includes all AP exam
graders — to differentiate between canned analysis and the real thing, which arises from a
reader’s unique interaction with a text.
Adapting your notes to answer several question types
In his famous poem, “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,” Wallace Stevens constantly
shifts the reader’s reality. One moment you’re looking at the contrast between the blackbird’s
eye and a snowy landscape, the next you see the bird in relation to human watchers. Stevens
gets a lot of mileage out of that feathered fellow because he understands that the blackbird’s
meaning changes, depending on how you look at it. So too with other literary works. If you
prepare a novel or a play by reviewing character, plot, and theme, you’re ready for any
number of prompts.

Free verse!
In general, you aren’t allowed to write about poems in
response to the open-ended question. However, writing
about a book-length poem or a play written in verse is
fine. If you do write about a poetic work for the third
essay, keep these ideas in mind when you’re recording
the must-have info for your work:
 Pick and choose plot points to support your thesis,
just as you do when writing about prose literature.
Most book-length poems and all plays written in
verse have some sort of plot, even if it’s one of those
avant-garde works where the actor eats his socks
or the poet creates words that have no formal mean-
ing. (Call me old-fashioned, but I’m much happier
when I can make sense of what’s going on.)
 If you remember anything about the poet’s tech-
nique, by all means feel free to mention it, as long
as it relates to the prompt that you’re answering. I
doubt that you’ve memorized many lines from a
book-length poem or a verse play, so you can’t dig
into the text in the same way you do when you’re
dealing with a poem printed on the exam. You can,
however, discuss a literary technique in general,
with few or no quotations.
For example, much of the figurative language in
Shakespeare’s Macbeth deals with sight, eyes, and
morality. In your essay, you might mention that
Macbeth asks the stars in the sky to “hide [their]
fires” so they won’t see his desire to kill the king.
Similarly, you might note that after the murder,
Macbeth is afraid to return to the murder scene
because he doesn’t want to look at what he’s done.
 If you do insert a quotation into the essay, punctuate
it correctly. The line break should be signaled with a
forward slash ( / ), or you can block the quotation.
(Chapter 7 explains in detail how to punctuate poetry
quotations.)

William Shakespeare’s Hamlet is a staple of high school English courses — and for good
reason! Not only does it represent one of the greatest writers at the height of his powers, it
also provides tons of discussion material. It’s stuffed with themes! In this section, I show you
how to record notes on that play (see Figure 14-1) and how to slice and dice the notes to fit
many prompts.
Title: Hamlet
Author: Shakespeare

Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

If you’ve prepared Hamlet with a form like the one in Figure 14-1 and have reviewed your
notes, you should be ready to attack any number of prompts. In the following lists, I show
you some points that you can extract to answer four different questions. (However, I don’t
answer the questions for you; I just get you started.)
If the prompt asks how the theme of appearance and reality relates to the work, you could
mention any of the following points:
 Hamlet isn’t really mad (or is he?).
 Ophelia only pretends to read a book so that Hamlet will reveal his true feelings to
hidden observers.
 Claudius appears to repent when he kneels to pray but actually refuses to change 
his ways.
 The play contains much discussion of prostitutes who cover their faces with makeup.
Similarly, the skull (death) that the gravediggers unearth is covered during life by
smiles.
If the prompt asks how parallel characters or situations affect the readers’ reactions, you
could mention any of the following points:
 Laertes loves his father Polonius.
 Hamlet loves his father, the late king.
 Laertes rushes to vengeance, but Hamlet stalls.
 King Hamlet has a talk with his son (the two ghost appearances).
 Polonius gives Laertes advice.
 Fortinbras of Norway attacks Denmark to avenge his father’s defeat and death in battle.
If the prompt asks how parent-child relationships are depicted, you could mention any of
the following points:
 Hamlet idealizes his father (“Hyperion to a satyr”) and displays anger toward his
mother. He berates her for having sex with Claudius.
 Laertes accepts his father’s advice respectfully.
 Fortinbras attempts to avenge his father’s death in battle by invading Denmark.
If the prompt asks how minor characters affect your view of a major character, you could
mention any of the following points:
 Ophelia reveals Hamlet’s cruelty; he calls her a prostitute and frightens her. She allows
herself to be used by her father and the king; when Hamlet suspects that she’s deceiv-
ing him, he becomes enraged.
 Horatio, Hamlet’s best friend, shows Hamlet’s appreciation of sincerity and loyalty.
Hamlet is natural and unforced in his conversations with Horatio. Horatio admires
Hamlet and thinks Hamlet would have made a good king.
I haven’t created thesis statements for these four potential essays, but you can do so easily
from the information on the form and from data in your memory bank. Notice that the points
for each prompt are slightly different, but each set could support a good essay.

Familiarizing Yourself with Open-Ended 
Essay Prompts
Creating essay prompts is one of those nerdy activities that English teachers love to do. We
find interesting quotations and insert them into our questions. We ponder timeless ideas and
ask students to relate them to the works that they’re writing about. We even throw in things
that puzzle us. The sky’s the limit, because we don’t have to answer the prompt. Sadly, you
do. This section gives you an overview of open-ended essay prompts so the territory will be
familiar on exam day. (For detailed instructions on decoding prompts, turn to Chapter 3.)
Standard elements of open-ended prompts
When you write an essay, half the battle is figuring out what the exam writer (or teacher) is
asking. Unfortunately, open-ended prompts tend to be longer than passage-based prompts,
making open-ended prompts not only a battle, but an uphill one. However, the basic format is
simple:
Famous person once said, “Important philosophical-sounding statement.” Select a liter-
ary work illustrating “important philosophical-sounding statement.” In a well-organized
essay, apply “important philosophical-sounding statement” to [a specified aspect of the
literary work]. Show how this aspect of the literary work contributes to the work as a
whole. Select a title from the list below or choose a work of similar quality. Avoid mere
plot summary.
Got the general idea? Good. Now I can dive into the specifics. Here are the standard ingredi-
ents of an open-ended essay prompt:
 A statement about life or literature: This statement may be a quotation from a literary
critic or an author. I always picture the exam writers hunched over a computer when I
see a quotation in an essay prompt. They’re typing “literature,” “life,” “war,” “peanut
butter,” or whatever into a search engine and then cutting and pasting the result.
However, sometimes the life/lit statement is a simple sentence from the exam writers
themselves. Maybe the search engine turned up nothing interesting?
The quotation or statement is included only to start you off. The important information
generally follows it. Take a look at this example, which is a product of my fevered imag-
ination and not a quotation from a real person:
Critic Alden Birch once remarked, “Literature creates relentless and inevitable
confusion.” Choose a work from the list below or another work of recognized lit-
erary merit in which a character or an event creates “relentless and inevitable
confusion.” Discuss how this confusion contributes to the work as a whole.
All the action is in the second sentence, which contains the assigned task. In this 
case, the second sentence instructs you to describe a character or an event that cre-
ates confusion.
 A list of literary works: On this list of works, expect to see novels and plays and an
occasional book-length poem drawn from works taught in high school or college
English courses. Unless your school is located on the planet Mars, you’ll likely run into
a couple of works that you have read in your own classes. Note: Once or twice a
decade, the AP doesn’t supply a list of works. If that sort of exam appears in front of
you, don’t panic. Just turn to your prepared works!
212
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

 The words “. . . or a work of similar literary merit [or quality or value]” or “a work
of recognized literary value”: These phrases mean that you get to pick any work that
you want as long as it ranks high in the literary world. How do you know which works
make the cut? Check out the earlier section “Adhering to standards of literary quality”
for details.
 The statement “. . . relates [or contributes] to the work as a whole”: This statement,
which nearly always appears in some form or another in open-ended essay prompts, is
about context. In fact, it’s so important that I devote a whole section of this chapter to
this part of the prompt. Flip to the later section “Relating the Part to the Whole” for
more information.
 The phrase “Avoid mere plot summary” or “Do not limit yourself to plot summary”:
This part of the prompt represents the exam graders’ defense against reading Hamlet
Lite instead of a true literary essay on Hamlet. Because this statement is important
enough to warrant its own sentence in an AP prompt, I comment on using, not summa-
rizing, plot in “Detecting and Selecting Evidence” later in this chapter.
The variable elements of open-ended prompts
The ideas that exam writers want you to discuss vary enormously, but some large categories
show up regularly. The open-ended essay prompt has to contain an idea that’s broad enough
to apply to many literary works. As the following list illustrates, the prompts address univer-
sal issues:
 Characterization: Good, evil, or some of both? Mad, irrational, or just eccentric?
Sidekick or star?
 Conflict: Internal or external? What’s the solution or response?
 Genre: Mystery, comedy, or tragedy? How do the mysterious, comic, or tragic ele-
ments affect the reader?
 Parts of the work: What does the setting, the opening scene or line, the climax, or the
title accomplish?
 Social norms: Upheld or betrayed? How does an individual or a society respond to
pressure?
 Identity, culture, or memory: What’s the influence of the past on the present? On a
particular character?
 Appearance and reality: Do appearance and reality differ? Why?
Detecting and Selecting Evidence
After you understand the prompt and have chosen a literary work to write about, you need
to create a thesis statement — the point you’re going to prove in your essay — and select evi-
dence to support your case. Then, of course, you have to write the essay. I discuss thesis
statements and general essay-writing in Chapter 3. This section concentrates on evidence.
When choosing evidence for an open-ended essay, you have to decide how to focus your
energy. You have two choices:
 You can make your coverage broad. If you “go wide” (as they say in football), you
cover a lot of ground. You may, for example, write about four characters from a novel.
The downside of this approach is that you can’t delve into each point you make
because you have too many. As a result, this sort of essay often feels like an overview,
and it can come across as shallow in the eyes of the essay grader.
213
Chapter 14: Free at Last: The Open-Ended Essay

 You can narrow the scope of your essay. The benefit of this approach is that you 
have time to analyze every subtopic in depth. For instance, you may discuss, say, two
characters. Then you have time to dig into the pair, giving lots of information about
each and providing many insightful comments and bits of evidence to support your
assertions. This approach also has its problems, though. The grader may say, “Where’s
character X or protagonist Y?” And if your luck goes sour, you may end up leaving out
the grader’s all-time favorite character.
What’s a harried — and hurried — AP essay-writer to do? Well, unfortunately, I can’t give you
an ironclad rule. My own preference is to keep essays narrow and deep, but I also know
teachers who prefer to see a wider range. You just have to decide for yourself. However,
whatever you do, take care to distribute your attention more or less evenly. Don’t end up
with a lopsided essay, with a long discussion of two subtopics and only two sentences about
a third. In that situation, it’s best to drop the third and use the extra time to polish what
you’ve written about the other two.
As you select evidence, remember that you’re writing an analytical essay, not a book report
that rehashes the story. Because exam graders hate unnecessary plot summary, you face the
tricky task of deciding how much to include about the plot and how much to leave out. Use
these guidelines to decide:
 If you choose a work from the list provided on the exam or another well-known
work, assume that the exam graders know the story. Trust me: they do. In fact, each
of them has probably taught the book at one point or another.
 If the work that you’re writing about isn’t on the list or isn’t well known, you can
add an introductory paragraph summarizing the plot. One paragraph. That’s it! And
don’t make it a ten-page paragraph, either. Simply write enough to keep the grader in
the loop. Here’s an example of an appropriate summary:
Zora Neale Hurston’s novel Jonah’s Gourd Vine traces the life story of John, a
character based on the author’s father. Set during Reconstruction, the novel
begins when John leaves his stepfather’s house and takes a job at the plantation
where his mother had been enslaved. John doesn’t realize that his employer is
his biological father. John’s charisma earns him a career as a preacher and a loyal
wife, Lucy. However, John’s infidelity to Lucy and his lack of self knowledge lead
to her death and his expulsion from his church.
See what I mean? Short but comprehensive — that’s exactly what you want. Now the
stage is set for whatever the prompt requires, and you can proceed as if you were writ-
ing about a more famous work.
 Imagine that the exam grader doesn’t agree with you. Every time you assert a point,
picture the grader’s wagging finger signaling “No, you’re wrong!” Your job is to argue,
changing that wagging finger to a nodding head that says, “Yes, you’ve convinced me.”
 Choose bits and pieces of the story that make your point, but try to be global with
your consideration of the text by showing textual knowledge of the entire work. The
most difficult aspect of writing an open-ended essay is that the text isn’t available to
you during the test. (No matter how good you are at stuffing books into your socks,
stay on the right side of the academic law. Nobody likes a cheater!) And because you
don’t have the text in front of you, you can’t quote much unless you have a terrific
memory. Therefore, you have to bolster your case with references to events in the plot
or to characters’ interactions.
Suppose, for example, that you’re writing about Lily, a character in Virginia Woolf’s To
the Lighthouse. Your point is that as a young woman she bows to societal pressure.
Even though you can’t quote the text, you can still support your point. For instance,
simply refer to the dinner-party scene, in which Lily asks Mr. Tansley silly questions,
just because this politeness is expected of her. You can also note that as he replies, Lily
seethes with anger at her own weakness, thinking that she should have stayed silent.
All she really wants to do is think about a picture that she’s painting.
214
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

Not all of your supporting events must fall into the once-in-a-character’s-lifetime, never-
to-be-forgotten category. In fact, sometimes a small (yet important) detail sticks in your
mind and is just what you need for your essay. For example, in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s
novel The Great Gatsby, Daisy looks at Jay Gatsby’s shirts. Her resistance to his love
begins to melt as she notes their many colors and soft cloth. This supporting point
may be evidence for any number of ideas: Daisy’s materialism or Gatsby’s momentary
success in erasing his humble origins, perhaps.
If you refer to the plot, be sure to focus on specifics and not generalizations. This
bullet, for example, gives details about Lily’s reaction to societal pressure in one partic-
ular situation. It isn’t enough to say that she caves in. You have to show that she caves
in by providing specific examples.
Relating the Part to the Whole
Nearly every open-ended essay prompt asks you to discuss the selected topic in the context
of the entire work. To answer this part of the question, imagine that the topic is a piece from
a jigsaw puzzle. How does it contribute to the big picture? To put it another way, how is the
work changed if that puzzle piece is missing? You don’t have to write a lot when responding
to this part of the essay prompt. One or two ideas, each described in four or five sentences,
should suffice.
When the prompt asks you to relate the topic to the work as a whole, consider how the
aspect of the work you’ve discussed changes the way the reader perceives the novel or play
or book-length poem.
Suppose, for example, a prompt asks you to discuss a clash of cultures (which was a real AP
question one year). You dig into a literary work — say, Shakespeare’s Othello. Here are a few
paragraphs that you might include to discuss the culture clash:
The title character is a Moor (a North African), a minority in white Venetian society.
Even though Othello is accepted for his skills as a military leader, he isn’t accepted
socially. In fact, when he marries a white woman, Desdemona, her father accuses
Othello of winning her love through witchcraft. Othello defends himself, explaining that
he wooed Desdemona with accounts of his adventures in the army.
Othello’s identity as a military man also leads to a culture clash. He’s straightforward,
honest, and naive; he’s also a man of action. Shortly after his marriage to Desdemona, 
he’s sent to defend the island of Cyprus from an invasion by Turkish forces. He’s ready for
battle, but he’s not ready for the romantic world (his relationship with Desdemona), or for
the political world, as represented by Iago. Iago, one of the great villains in literature, was
passed over as Othello’s lieutenant. He gets his revenge through an elaborate plot to make
Othello doubt Desdemona’s fidelity. Iago twists and manipulates every situation.
The preceding paragraphs explain the culture clash. Now it’s time to relate that clash to the
work as a whole. You can say, for instance, something like this:
Othello’s straight-shooting style makes him more vulnerable to Iago’s plots. The military
is all about giving and receiving orders: attack, retreat, clean your rifle, and so on.
Political or personal manipulation of that sort practiced by Iago is exactly the opposite.
Iago never says what he means; he says what he thinks will ruin Othello’s life.
Another possible part/whole relation comes from the fact that Othello’s military mindset
places him at a disadvantage in dealing with women and contributes to his tendency to deal
with problems violently. Othello’s all-male army experience didn’t exactly prepare him for
love and marriage. This aspect of the culture clash arouses the reader’s sympathy, even after
Othello murders his wife in a fit of jealous rage.

Aiming for a Bull’s Eye
You can’t hit an invisible target (unless you get super-lucky), so in this section I provide a
sample essay written in response to an open-ended prompt. I also include an evaluation of
that essay.
An open-ended essay example
The following essay was written by a student practicing for the AP exam in response to a
prompt that asked how a tragic hero caused others to suffer and how that suffering affects
the tragedy as a whole.
In Beloved by Toni Morrison, the tragic character of Sethe is the cause of much of the
unhappiness in the book. She is the main catalyst for action and is portrayed as slightly
scary. However, the book is also a historical novel and as such, the tragedy that sur-
rounds her leads the reader to a greater understanding of the tragedy of slavery as a
whole. The way that Sethe treats Paul D., Denver, and the community as represented by
Stamp Paid shows both how she creates suffering in others and how the tragedy inher-
ent in any story about slavery actually exists.
In her interactions with Paul D., Sethe brings him suffering, even though he loves her.
Although at first Paul D. appears to be happy with Sethe, eventually he becomes
unhappy because he is seduced by Beloved and feels unmanned. While Paul D. was a
slave, he couldn’t love anything too much, so metaphorically he put his heart in a tin
can so that it wouldn’t have to hurt. After Beloved and Sethe become close with him, his
tin can is broken and all of the emotions that Paul D. has kept inside come out. The self-
loathing that Paul D. feels because he was a slave and not fully a man are finally
revealed. Through the pain that Paul D. feels from finding that Sethe, the woman he
loves, killed her baby and from the way that Beloved emasculates him, we see not only
the tragedy of Paul and Sethe’s relationship but also the tragedy of the book as a whole
in how it deals with the corruption of society and people caused by slavery.
Sethe’s relationship to Denver has similar problems. The stories that Denver has been
told about her childhood lead her to be scared of her mother. Since Sethe broke the rule
of not loving things as a slave and she loved her children too much, she had to kill her
daughter. The pain that Sethe has caused Denver shows us again just how much slavery
has disturbed society. Even the scars on Sethe’s back, where the schoolteacher’s
nephews beat her after they took her milk, have led to Sethe’s corrupt love for her chil-
dren. Sethe felt an incredibly strong need to give her children milk after that incident,
another example of the way Sethe loved her children so much that she killed one of
them. The tragedy of a child’s being afraid that her mother will kill her shows just what
the experience of slavery can do to family relationships.
Sethe also brings tragedy to the community at large and to Stamp Paid, the symbolic
leader of the community. The way that she breaks down and murders her child ruins
their vision of happiness. Stamp Paid and the community are horrified at the way Sethe
has acted because she is an example of a woman following animal instincts, which is
something the ex-slaves are very anxious to prove they do not follow. Sethe ruins their
vision of themselves also, since they feel partly to blame for not warning her. This
tragedy of misunderstanding and pride shows us just how much the African American
community as a whole has lost to slavery.
All of the tragedy that happens to Sethe and that is caused by Sethe contributes to our
understanding of the novel as a whole. Toni Morrison wrote a work dealing with the
utter tragedy of slavery, and she succeeds in that task admirably. Each individual
tragedy is a piece of the whole tragedy of the historical period the novel captures.

Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

Evaluation of the open-ended essay example
The example essay makes many good points, though it isn’t perfect. It accomplishes the 
task — to show how Sethe causes others to suffer and to relate that suffering to the novel 
as a whole. If I were grading this essay, I’d give it 7 or 8 points out of a possible 9.
Here are the good points of this essay example:
 The essay addresses the question, stating correctly that Sethe hurts Paul D., Denver,
and the larger community represented by Stamp Paid.
 The essay places the individual events (Sethe’s murder of her baby, Paul D.’s fears
about his masculinity, Denver’s traumatic childhood, and the community’s flawed
sense of itself) in the context of slavery and its aftermath.
 The references to the text are, for the most part, specific and clear.
 For the most part the essay is written in a mature style, with good command of language.
 The writing is grammatically correct, with proper spelling.
 The essay is reasonably well organized, with a good introduction, logical body para-
graph divisions, and a fairly strong conclusion.
Here are the areas for improvement:
 The essay includes some repetitive statements.
 A few sentences are worded awkwardly.
 Though Stamp Paid is mentioned, the evidence and analysis relating to him is short.
More could be said about his situation. One solution is to drop him from the essay and
use the extra time to discuss Denver or Paul D. in greater depth.
 Sethe’s suffering is alluded to, but her status as a tragic hero isn’t supported by evi-
dence. A couple of sentences about her beating and degradation while enslaved and
her desperate murder of her baby just as the slave catchers appear should be included
in the essay.
 The evaluative statement in the last paragraph could be cut. The graders don’t want to
know whether you like or dislike a work. They want you to analyze it!

In This Chapter
 Understanding paired-passage prompts

 Examining effective structures for paired-passage essays
 Practicing and evaluating paired-passage essays
L
ife, especially AP life, is unfair. Consider this fact: Paired-passage questions force you to
read two literary works and then compare and contrast specific elements in them. After
you’re finished writing, however, you get credit for only one essay. Fortunately, paired-pas-
sages are like Category 5 hurricanes: They don’t appear often, but they seem to show up
more and more frequently these days. Nearly all paired-passage essays on the AP English
Literature and Composition exam are based on poetry. But a handful have addressed prose,
and so you should be ready for those passages also. (Thus far, the exam writers haven’t
paired drama passages. Stay tuned, though. They could be coming around the bend.)
In this chapter, I show you the quickest, most effective way to deal with paired-passage ques-
tions on the AP exam. I also provide some sample questions and evaluation guidelines so
that you’re prepared if your very own AP exam contains double trouble. As a bonus, the
strategies outlined in this chapter work well for the compare and contrast essays that you
write for homework or tests during the school year.
Seeing Double: Paired-Passage Prompts
They look different from the other AP essay prompts, but at heart, paired-passage prompts
require you to write an essay, and you already know how to tackle that task. However, paired-
passage essays differ from single-work essays just enough to make your life interesting:
Paired-passage prompts ask you to compare and contrast two works. Sometimes the prompt
specifies a particular literary element, and sometimes the question is more general. (Feeling
shaky about the single-work essays? Turn to Chapter 3 for essay basics. Chapter 7 zeroes in
on poetry essays, and Chapter 12 focuses on prose and drama essays.)
Here are some of the most common types of paired-passage prompts:
 Comparison of the speakers’ attitudes and the poets’ techniques: For example, 
consider this prompt:
Read the following two poems carefully. Then, in a well-organized essay, compare
the speakers’ attitudes toward dreams and the techniques the poets use to
convey the speakers’ views.
As you can see, this sample prompt focuses on the attitude of each speaker and allows
you to choose the poetic devices that you want to analyze.

 Significance of an image and a comparison of poetic technique: Here’s an example of
this type of prompt:
Read these poems, taking note of the significance of the color red. Then write a
well-organized essay comparing and contrasting the color red in the poems, dis-
cussing such literary techniques as imagery, figurative language, and diction.
This prompt zeroes in on the color red, specifying three literary elements — imagery,
figurative language, and diction — but allows you to expand beyond those literary ele-
ments.
Whenever the door is open, walk through it! Discuss imagery, figurative language, and
diction, but add something else if you can. That way your essay will stand out from the
crowd.
 Comparison of two poems by one author and the literary elements in them: Take a
look at this example prompt:
The following two poems by William Wordsworth were published in 1800 and
1810. In a well-organized essay, compare and contrast the two poems, taking into
account the literary devices used in each.
This prompt leaves everything up to you. You get to choose the literary devices you
want to mention and how much consideration to give the content.
When you’re faced with a general prompt that allows you to choose what to write about,
spend most of your energy and time commenting on how the poem or passage is writ-
ten. The AP exam is a test of your ability to analyze literature, so content plays a sec-
ondary role while literary technique is the star.
Twice in the last 30 years, AP test takers have faced “wildcard” prompts — strange, paired-
passage questions that break the mold. One wildcard, vintage 1977, displayed two poems by
D.H. Lawrence and asked for an essay explaining why the second poem was better. Another
wildcard prompt showed up in 1985. This time test takers were asked to compare two drafts
of one prose passage, suggesting reasons for the changes and explaining the effect of the
writer’s revisions. Nothing like these two prompts has ever appeared again, I suspect
because the graders vetoed a repeat performance.
Annotating and Gathering Ideas from Pairs
When two literary works appear on an exam, a reader’s instinctive reaction is to compare
and contrast one to the other. And that instinct guides you to the correct path! In fact, you
should follow that instinct even if the words “compare and contrast” don’t appear in the
prompt. The basic technique is to zigzag between one passage or poem and the other. Here
are some steps you can follow to gather your thoughts:
1. Read both selections.
Don’t write anything the first time through. Just read, keeping in mind what the prompt
asks you to address.
2. Read the first selection again, annotating as you read.
With the second selection in the back of your mind, reread the first. Underline every-
thing in the first passage that stands out, particularly anything that seems different
from the second passage. In the margin, note possible effects for each difference that
you spot. (Check out Chapter 3 for more details on annotating text as you read.)
3. Read the second selection again, annotating as you read.
Let the first passage be your background music as you read the second passage.
Consider how key elements in this passage differ from those in the first passage; also
consider how the passage would change if those key elements were removed.
220
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

4. Create a thesis statement that responds to the prompt and takes both selections into
account.
A thesis statement is generally confined to one sentence, but paired-passage essays
sometimes call for a two-sentence thesis. In either case, start on the road to a thesis by
making a statement about each passage or poem. Combine the statements if you can. If
not, leave them as separate sentences.
5. Gather supporting evidence.
Read the passages or poems once more, looking for significant details in each that sup-
port your thesis.
The appearance of the words “juxtapose” or “juxtaposition” in an AP English essay sets off
flutters in graders’ hearts. “Juxtapose,” the verb, means to place two things next to each
other. “Juxtaposition” is the noun. For reasons unknown, these words make your essay
sound more mature and thoughtful — but only if you use them correctly and only if you actu-
ally have something to say about the effect of the juxtaposition. In paired-passage essays,
you might consider how the reader’s reaction to each selection changes because of the juxta-
position of the two. The literary analysis should center on the way the pair works as a unit in
the reader’s mind.
Building for Two: Structuring 
Paired-Passage Essays
When you’re writing about a pair of literary works, you resemble the parents-to-be of twins.
The happy-but-terrified future mom and dad have to decide how to preserve the individual
identity of each sibling and how to deal with the fact that twins naturally form a unique part-
nership. Similarly, you, the lucky AP test taker facing a paired-passage essay, have to divide
the essay so that each literary selection gets the attention it’s due without forgetting the fact
that the pair is, in fact, a pair. Creating a sturdy structure to hold your ideas is the key to han-
dling paired passages.
One size doesn’t always fit all, especially on the AP exam. In the following sections, I present
a couple of possible structures for paired-passage essays. Depending on the literature and
prompt you must respond to, you may find one easier to use than another. You may even
come up with something unique. No problem. As long as you have a logical path that the
grader can walk on, you’re fine.
The half-and-half approach: 
Dividing the essay in two
The easiest structure for a paired-passage is one that divides the essay into two large
chunks. One chunk discusses the first literary selection, and the other analyzes the second.
The strength of this design lies in its simplicity. You don’t have to make many decisions
about where each supporting point belongs, and you can practically fly through the body
paragraphs.
Here’s a bare bones outline of the different paragraphs in an essay written with the half-and-
half approach:
221
Chapter 15: Double Trouble: Paired-Passage Essays

Introduction: Titles and authors of both works, if known, and a thesis statement
First body paragraph: Analysis and evidence for the first passage
Second body paragraph: Analysis and evidence for the second passage
Conclusion: Statement about the pair, relating one to the other or building on what you
said in the body of the essay
The conclusion to this sort of essay can make or break your score, because this paragraph is
where you tie the two selections together. You have to end with a punch or your reader (who
is — need I point out? — the exam grader) will feel that you honored the individuality of the
selections but didn’t really deal with them as a pair.
Here are a couple of good, bring-it-all-together conclusions:
Smyth’s ironic tone makes the naïveté of the speaker in Adamson’s poem all the more
poignant. The world-weary Smyth seems centuries older than Adamson’s speaker,
despite abundant imagery indicating that Smyth is relatively young. These poems illus-
trate that age is partly a matter of experience and one’s unique reactions, not simply a
matter of the calendar.
William Tenger glorifies winter with a series of idealized metaphors and formal, almost
elegiac diction, while Olivia May presents a more realistic view through choice of her
detail and her natural, unforced word choices.
Notice that both of these sample conclusions make one statement about each separate selec-
tion, relating them to each other.
If you select the half-and-half structure for your essay, take care that your “twins” don’t
resemble Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger in terms of height. In other words, your
essay should give equal attention to each selection. If you write three pages on one selection
and a quarter page on the other, your essay will be lopsided, and your score will suffer. You
don’t need an exact 50/50 divide, but stay as close as you can to this proportion.
The thematic approach: Sorting by ideas
With the thematic approach, you structure your essay by sorting your information according
to the different ideas derived from each of the selections. The ideas, or subtopics, vary
depending on the selections and the prompt. Each body paragraph discusses both selections.
The advantage of this structure is that it forces you to consider the works as a pair. And by
constantly moving from one work to another, you discover more about the relationship
between the two as you plan the content of each body paragraph.
The thematic essay looks like this:
Introduction: Titles and authors of both works, if known, and a thesis statement
First body paragraph: Analysis of one literary element or aspect of meaning, along with
evidence from each work
Second body paragraph: Analysis of a second literary element or aspect of meaning,
along with evidence from each work
Additional body paragraphs: Analysis of any additional literary elements or aspects of
meaning, along with evidence from each work, with as many additional paragraphs as
needed
Conclusion: Final thoughts about the overall effect of each work, perhaps how they’re
similar and how they’re different
222
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

The drawback of this approach is that you have to organize your thoughts very quickly. And
if you aren’t well prepared before you begin to write on the answer sheet, this structure can
sink you. True, you can always tuck in one or two extra thoughts — neatly! — with a caret
symbol (^). However, graders may tolerate only a few insertions and a bit of rearrangement.
Simply remember that a standard element of an AP prompt is the phrase “in a well-organized
essay.”
The similarities-and-differences approach:
Grouping like and unlike
On the second read-through of a paired-passage question, you may begin to see a pattern of
similarities and differences emerging. If you’d like, you can go with the pattern and organize
your essay around these two categories. The benefit of this structure is its simplicity. You
probably make a same/different list automatically. Perhaps these classifications are hard-
wired into the human brain!
The similarities-and-differences structure looks like this:
Introduction: Titles and authors of both works, if known, and a thesis statement
First body paragraph: Discussion of the way in which the two selections are similar,
with supporting evidence from each work
Second body paragraph: Discussion of the way in which the two selections are differ-
ent, with supporting evidence from each work
Conclusion: Final thoughts about the overall similarities and differences of each work,
perhaps speculating about the intentions of the authors and about the effect that each
work has on the reader
The pitfall of a similarities-and-differences essay is that this structure may ping-pong the
grader. You may end up with sentences like “Poem A relies on imagery to create an ominous
mood, as the speaker describes . . . and poem B creates the same mood through diction. . . .
Poem A’s speaker appreciates the spring, calling it . . . in the same way that poem B’s speaker
finds the season. . . .” The back and forth is inevitable with this structure, but it’s a little less
annoying if you make substantial statements — a couple of sentences, perhaps — about one
selection before turning to the other. With a little more to chew on, the grader is less likely to
experience whiplash.
Practicing Effective Compare/Contrast Essays
I’m guessing that every New Yorker is familiar with the old joke in which a tourist asks how
to get to the famous concert venue, Carnegie Hall. The answer: “Practice!” That’s the answer
for you, too, if your destination is a good grade on the AP English exam. In this section, you
have three chances to prove your brilliance. Write one, two, or all three essays, and then
check your work using the evaluation guide at the end of the chapter.
Essay prompt 1
The following poems, “Civil War” by Hettie Jones and “Returning” by Abby Wender, both deal
with family visits. In “Civil War,” the speaker visits her sister. In “Returning,” the speaker and
her husband visit the husband’s ancestral home in Sri Lanka. Read the poems carefully. In a
well-written essay, compare and contrast each speaker’s attitude and the poetic devices used
to convey it.

“Civil War” by Hettie Jones (Reprinted from Drive, ©1998, by Hettie Jones, by permission
of Hanging Loose Press)
Into my sister’s kitchen
light pours
across the patio
of American dreams
outside
a bird calls
sometimes
you can hear him
as I hear my indefatigable sister
bounding through
her dream house
where the jungle waits
twenty feet
away
lush  impenetrable
the bird is loud
I have come
into the sun
to be with him
and when I hear his long and varied
riff against the background
of air conditioners
how easy it is for me to imagine
that he is singing to me
or to my sister
my indefatigable sister
against whose screen
lizards run
against whose heart
I hold no weapon
against whose dream
I am forever
committed

“Returning” by Abby Wender
The armoire opens: I smell mildew.
It’s the salt in the air,” my husband says.
Hair plump as a watered bush, he paces
the house he was born in,
reacquainting himself as if a part of him
had been left here,
unsuitable for the cold climate of an immigrant’s life,
and so that part is stored
in the cabinet alongside his batik1 shirts and sandals.
What do I make of him?
He wraps an orange and black sarong2 around his waist,
struts the garden. He is the son of kings.
A sari3 halves my stride, I’m hobbled.
Baby Hamu, the servants call, as in Baby Master.
I am Suddu Hamu, Ghost Mistress.
His feet absorb the dark polish of the old stone floors.
On the veranda, squatting like an old pelican, a palm reader trills,
“No master! Believe me, your time is good, very good. The bad time is over!”
From Galle and Kandy4, aunties and uncles arrive
with packages of tea and teardrop-shaped ashtrays
of pounded silver, each engraved From Sri Lanka.
“We don’t smoke,” I say. They nod yes, meaning no.
At 3 a.m., tripping over a servant asleep at our door,
I mumble, “Workers of the world unite!”
and walk past shelves of National Geographic, circa 1950,
flakes of gold crumble to the floor.
My husband’s reading old letters.
On the desk a typewriter sits open, no new fingerprints on its keys.
On the wall, his father stares from a black and white photo,
arm raised: A son could do so much for his country.
Yes, I say, meaning no.
1. Printed fabric.
2. A garment tied around the waist.
3. A traditional dress.

Essay prompt 2
Carefully read each of the following poems, “Sunset in the Tropics” by James Weldon
Johnson and “A London Thoroughfare. 2 A.M.” by Amy Lowell. In a well-organized essay, 
analyze how each poet depicts the night.
“Sunset in the Tropics” by James Weldon Johnson
A silver flash from the sinking sun,
Then a shot of crimson across the sky
That, bursting, lets a thousand colors fly
And riot among the clouds; they run,
Deepening in purple, flaming in gold,
Changing, and opening fold after fold,
Then fading through all of the tints of the rose into gray,
Till, taking quick fright at the coming night,
They rush out down the west,
In hurried quest
Of the fleeing day.
Now above where the tardiest color flares a moment yet,
One point of light, now two, now three are set
To form the starry stairs, —
And, in her fire-fly crown,
Queen Night, on velvet slippered feet, comes softly down.
“A London Thoroughfare. 2 A.M.” by Amy Lowell
They have watered the street,
It shines in the glare of lamps,
Cold, white lamps,
And lies
Like a slow-moving river,
Barred with silver and black.
Cabs go down it,
One,
And then another.
Between them I hear the shuffling of feet.
Tramps doze on the window-ledges,
Night-walkers pass along the sidewalks.
The city is squalid and sinister,
With the silver-barred street in the midst,
Slow-moving,
A river leading nowhere.

Opposite my window,
The moon cuts,
Clear and round,
Through the plum-coloured night.
She cannot light the city;
It is too bright.
It has white lamps,
And glitters coldly.
I stand in the window and watch the moon.
She is thin and lustreless,
But I love her.
I know the moon,
And this is an alien city.
Essay prompt 3
In the following passages, Heywood Broun and Alexander Woollcott express their views on
the origins of moral behavior. In a well-written essay, compare and contrast their views and
discuss the literary devices each writer employs.
Selection 1 by Heywood Broun
The guardians of morals hold that if the spectator sees a picture of a man robbing a safe
he will thereby be moved to want to rob a safe himself. In rebuttal we offer the testi-
mony of a gentleman much wiser in the knowledge of human conduct than any censor.
Writing in The New Republic, George Bernard Shaw advocated that hereafter public read-
ing-rooms supply their patrons only with books about evil characters. For, he argued,
after reading about evil deeds our longings for wickedness are satisfied vicariously. On
the other hand there is the danger that the public may read about saints and heroes and
drain off its aspirations in such directions without actions.
We believe this is true. We once saw a picture about a highwayman (that was in the days
before censorship was as strict as it is now) and it convinced us that the profession
would not suit us. We had not realized the amount of compulsory riding entailed. The
particular highwayman whom we saw dined hurriedly, slept infrequently, and invariably
had his boots on. Mostly he was being pursued and hurdling over hedges. It left us sore
in every muscle to watch him. At the end of the eighth reel every bit of longing in our
soul to be a swashbuckler had abated. The man in the picture had done the adventuring
for us and we could return in comfort to a peaceful existence.
Selection 2 by Alexander Woollcott
A cigarette addict who, in a spartan moment, swears off smoke, is familiar enough with
the inner gnaw that robs him of his sleep and roils his dinner for days and days. His
body, long habituated to the tobacco, had dutifully taken on the business of manufactur-
ing its antidote. When the tobacco is abruptly removed, the body continues for a while
to turn out the antidote as usual and during that while, that antidote goes roaming
angrily through the system seeking something to oppose and destroy.

A somewhat analogous condition has agitated the body politic ever since the late Fall of
1918. The passage of the Eighteenth Amendment1 had robbed the prohibitionists of their
chief excitement; then the signing of the Armistice2 took away the glamor of public-
spiritedness from all those good people who had had such a splendid time keeping an
eye on their presumably treasonable neighbors. Behold, then, the Busy Body (which is
in every one of us) all dressed up and nowhere to go. The itch became tremendous. The
moving pictures caught it first. No wonder the American playwright is uneasy. He ought
to be.
He dreads a censorship of the theatre because he suspects (not without reason) that it
will be corrupt, that it will work foolishly, and that, having taken and relished an inch, it
will take an ell.3

Answer Guide for Compare/Contrast Essays
All done? Great! Now it’s time to see how your efforts rate on the AP grading scale. In this
section, I provide a list of possible points to make about each set of literary works and a dis-
cussion of the suitable structures for each essay.
General essay requirements
Before I get to the specifics, I want to go over the basics that are important to your success.
Be sure to read your essay with these general standards in mind:
 Your essay should deal with each of the two selections.
 Your essay should relate one selection to the other, comparing and contrasting content
and literary technique as specified by the prompt.
 The essay should be organized in a logical way with an introduction, body, and 
conclusion.
 You should support your assertions with evidence (quotations or references to the
texts).
 The essay should display good grammar and spelling and a mature writing style.
Potential points for essay 1
Both poems referred to by essay prompt 1 express affection and frustration, understanding
and miscommunication — the staples of family life. In the following sections, I list the ways
that the poems are alike and different, and then I show you the evidence that you can use to
support your statements about similarities and differences. Finally, I discuss the best organi-
zational structures for your essay.
Main points
The similarities and differences between “Civil War” and “Returning” include the following:
 Both poems express uneasiness; these aren’t purely joyous visits. Neither poem
expresses open anger or disagreement, however. The war is “civil” in the first poem,
and the speaker in “Returning” says “yes,” though she means “no.”
228
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 
(10)
(15)

 Both poems rely on description of the setting to represent the human relationship.
 “Civil War” is more visual; the margins echo the conflict (see Chapter 4 for more on
how a poem’s form can affect meaning). Wender’s poem includes more details, such as
the National Geographic magazines and the photo of the father. She uses dialogue and
description to get her point across. Jones, on the other hand, is more indirect; the bird
and screen represent the barrier between the sisters.
Evidence
Here’s some evidence from “Civil War” that you can use as support in your essay:
 The speaker visits her sister, who’s in her “dream house” (line 11). The allusion in line
4 to “American dreams” calls to mind picket fences, apple pie, two-car garages, and all
the other staples of the traditional American image of happiness.
 The sister is “bounding through” (line 10) her house, but the speaker has “come / into
the sun” (lines 17–18) to be with the bird. In lines 23–24, the bird symbolizes the
speaker: “how easy it is for me to imagine / that he [the bird] is singing to me.” “Bird”
calls to mind “free as a bird,” and the speaker is outside, associated with nature. But
the sister is inside, where the air conditioner attempts to control nature. The house is
walled off from nature; the lizard (a part of nature) runs against a screen of the house.
The “jungle waits” (line 12) outside; this line links the speaker to wild and untamed
nature.
 The title of the poem has several meanings: A “civil war” takes place within a family
unit, and the sisters are part of that unit. The last lines “against whose dream / I am for-
ever / committed” (lines 31–33) plainly state the speaker’s opposition to her sister’s
aspirations. The speaker’s dream is different from her sibling’s “American dreams”
(line 4). “Civil” also means “polite,” and the speaker “hold[s] no weapon” (line 30)
against her sister’s heart. In other words, even though they don’t agree, they don’t fight
either.
 Line 30 in the poem shows that the speaker is vulnerable to her sister, because she
can’t fight her sister’s love; the speaker is defenseless when it comes to her sister. The
fact that the sister is “indefatigable” (lines 9 and 26) reveals that she never stops trying
to achieve her dream or to convince her sister of the rightness of “American dreams”
(line 4).
 The speaker’s attitude is revealed through figurative language — the symbols of the
bird, lizard, jungle, and air conditioner — and allusion (“American dreams” in line 4).
The margins also seesaw, visually representing the back-and-forth of a “civil war”
between sisters.
If you need a refresher course on figurative language, symbolism, and allusion, flip to
Chapter 4.
Here’s supporting evidence for the second poem, “Returning”:
 The poem contrasts the experiences of the husband and wife during their visit to the
husband’s childhood home. The husband expands; he’s described as having “[h]air
plump as a watered bush” (line 3). He regains “that part” (line 8) of himself that’s
“stored / in the cabinet alongside his batik shirts and sandals” (lines 8–9). He “struts . . .
the son of kings” (line 12).
On the other hand, the speaker, his wife, contracts. She is “hobbled” (line 13) by the
sari that “halves” (line 13) her stride. He becomes “Baby Master” (line 14), but she
turns into a “Ghost Mistress” (line 15). In other words, he gains the power that a baby
has over a family. The wife, instead, loses herself and becomes a ghost.
229
Chapter 15: Double Trouble: Paired-Passage Essays

 The speaker is exasperated during the trip. She wakes “tripping over a servant asleep
at our door” (line 23) and mutters a pro-workers’-rights slogan (line 24). She also states
a fact to the relatives — “We don’t smoke” (line 22) — but they don’t really listen:
“They nod yes, meaning no” (line 22). In line 10, she’s also surprised at the change in
her husband. She wonders, “What do I make of him?”
 The last few lines illustrate the speaker’s urge to rebel. While her husband reads “old
letters” (line 27), she interprets the photo of her father-in-law as a call to come back
home — “A son could do so much for his country” (line 30) — but rejects that comment
with an ironic reference to the relatives’ statement: “Yes, I say, meaning no” (line 31).
 The imagery and choice of detail reveal the speaker’s belief that her husband has
gained importance during the visit. Figurative language is also important. Notice the
simile in line 3 (“plump as a watered bush”) and the metaphor in line 12 (“He is the son
of kings”).
 The title of the poem, “Returning,” may signify that the husband is “returning” to
former prominence. If he’s “returning,” he must be in a different state outside of the
ancestral home, so the implication is that the husband-wife relationship is more bal-
anced when they aren’t in Sri Lanka.
Organization
You can structure essay 1 in several different ways. One possibility is to devote a body para-
graph to each poem and then to compare and contrast the works in the conclusion.
You could also devote one body paragraph to imagery, another to figurative language, and
another to allusion, margins, and dialogue. The downside of this structure is the awkward-
ness of that third group; the literary elements don’t easily fit together. However, you can
make this structure work by specifically stating that the two poems are alike in employing
imagery and figurative language (body paragraphs one and two) and differ in other ways
(body paragraph three). In body paragraph three, explain that Jones employs allusions and
visual arrangement of lines to make her point and Wender relies more on dialogue and
description.
Overall assessment
I’ve listed a lot of points you may make about these two wonderful poems. If you got every
single one, consider applying for my job. In 40 minutes, however, it’s likely that you had time
to state each speaker’s attitude and mention perhaps three supporting points, with evidence,
from each poem. Consider yourself in great shape if you identified those six. If you analyzed
only one literary technique for each poem but correctly identified the speakers’ attitudes,
you have probably written a fair but not great essay.
Potential points for essay 2
Setting is important in both poems. Johnson’s poem is set in “the tropics,” though the reader
doesn’t know exactly where. The time is dusk, as night arrives. Lowell’s poem describes a
London street at 2 a.m. In the following sections, I list the ways that the poems are alike and
different, and then I show you the evidence you can use as support for your statements
about those similarities and differences. Finally, I discuss the best organizational structures
for your essay.

Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

 Both poems depict night as separate from human experience. For instance, in
Johnson’s poem, night is personified and replaces the human element. In Lowell’s
poem, the city fights against the night.
 Johnson’s poem sees night as powerful and victorious; Lowell’s poem sees night as
unable to dominate the city.
 Johnson relies on figurative language and color imagery; Lowell also employs figurative
language, but line breaks and sound also play a role.
Evidence
Here’s some evidence from “Sunset in the Tropics” that you can use as support in your
essay:
 This poem’s depiction of night is generally positive. The color imagery is beautiful 
and lively. However, notice the hint of danger: “silver flash” (line 1), “shot of crimson”
(line 2), and colors that “riot” (line 4) and “flam[e]” (line 5). The colors also flee in
“quick fright” (line 8).
 The colors are personified. For instance, they “run” (line 4) and “rush out” (line 9).
Because they’ve become “human,” the colors may have human emotions.
 The night is personified as “Queen Night” (line 16).
 The order in the poem suggests a royal court; the colors precede the arrival of the
“Queen Night” (line 16) in “her fire-fly crown” (line 15).
 The poet also employs other types of figurative language that glorify night, such 
as metaphor. These metaphors include “starry stairs” (line 14) and “fire-fly crown” 
(line 15).
 One pattern emerges when you examine the rhyme scheme: You see couplets (pairs of
lines), each separated by either one or two lines. The couplets suggest that the events
are predictable; order exists in this poem.
Check Chapter 4 for details regarding imagery, personification, and rhyme scheme.
Here’s supporting evidence for the second poem, “A London Thoroughfare. 2 A.M.”:
 Unlike “Sunset in the Tropics,” this poem is set in the city of London, where night
arrived some hours earlier. Here night isn’t a beautiful arrival; it’s something to fight.
The “cold, white lamps” (line 3) battle the darkness. “The moon cuts” (line 18) but
“[s]he cannot light the city” (line 21). The city is alienated from night, which is
depicted almost as an occupying power.
 Night in the city isn’t pleasant. The street is like “a slow moving river” (line 5) that’s later
deemed to be “leading nowhere” (line 16). Feet are “shuffling” (line 10) and “[t]ramps
doze on the window-ledges” (line 11) while prostitutes, or “Night-walkers” (line 12), pass.
The speaker makes a judgment: “The city is squalid and sinister” (line 13).
 The speaker says, “I know the moon” (line 28), and sees the city as “alien” (line 29).
Thus the speaker allies herself with nature and against the city. The implication is that
the city, which represents the majority of human beings, is alienated from nature.
 Diction is particularly effective in this poem. The fact that the lamps are “cold” (line 3)
and feet are “shuffling” (line 10) evokes old age, sickness, and death. Adding to this
impression is the personification of the moon, which is “thin and lustreless” (line 26).
The street is “silver-barred” (line 14), which is a description suggesting confinement.
231
Chapter 15: Double Trouble: Paired-Passage Essays

 Sound patterns link ideas in this poem as well. Listen to the long “I” sounds at the
beginning of the poem in “shines” (line 2), “white” (line 3), and “lies” (line 4). The moon
looks beautiful, but that impression is false — a lie. Similarly, take note of the “S”
sounds: “squalid and sinister” (line 13), “silver-barred” (line 14), “Slow” (line 15). All of
these words have negative connotations.
 The sense of alienation is emphasized by line breaks. The cabs travel “One, / And then
another” (lines 8 and 9). The break after “one” implies disconnection.
For information regarding how diction and sound can affect poetry, flip to Chapter 4.
Organization
The easiest way to organize the information in your essay is to write a paragraph about simi-
larities and a paragraph about differences in the depiction of night, using the bullets in the
“Main points” section. Another simple plan is to devote a paragraph to each poem and then
sum up the differences and similarities in the conclusion.
Overall assessment
A very good AP essay correctly identifies the depiction of night in each poem. Supporting
points should include at least three ideas about each poem, identifying at least two of the
poetic techniques that each poet employs and relating these techniques to the way in which
the night is depicted. If you had time to make only one or two points about each poem, or if
you didn’t address the literary techniques, your essay is only fair.
Potential points for essay 3
The selections for essay 3 are excerpted from Noncensorship, a volume of essays protesting
censorship. In the following sections, I list the ways that the essays are alike and different,
and then I show you the evidence you can use as support for your statements about those
similarities and differences. Finally, I discuss the best organizational structures for your
essay.
Main points
The similarities and differences between Broun’s and Woollcott’s passages include the 
following:
 Both writers employ irony. The writers, acclaimed American humorists, question moral
crusades. In general, they mean the opposite of what they say.
 Broun’s tone is less bitter than Woollcott’s. Woollcott sees the end of World War I pri-
marily as depriving moralists of their favorite pastime — spying on the neighbors to
root out treasonable behavior. Broun’s remarks about the highwayman mock his own
love of ease and comfort. It’s significant that Broun uses first person plural point of
view (the “we” form) and that Woollcott uses third person (the “he” form). By using
these points of view, Broun includes himself in the group to be mocked, but Woollcott
places himself in a superior position.
Evidence
Here’s supporting evidence from Broun’s passage that you can use in your essay:
 Broun says, tongue-in-cheek, that movies should feature villains because doing so dis-
courages immoral behavior and promotes morality. His long description of the high-
wayman is comical, as in this sentence: “We had not realized the amount of
compulsory riding entailed” (line 11) in this profession.
232
Part IV: Paired Passages and the Open-Ended Essay 

 Broun relies on hyperbole to create humor: “At the end of the eighth reel every bit of
longing in our soul to be a swashbuckler had abated” (lines 14–15).
 The super-formal (and at times antiquated) diction also creates humor. Broun writes of
“evil deeds” (line 6), “wickedness” (line 6), and “swashbucklers” (line 15).
Here’s evidence from Woollcott’s passage:
 Woollcott sees the crusade against drinking and draft-evasion as fulfilling a need 
to find “something to oppose and destroy” (line 6) after being deprived. Morality, in
Woollcott’s view, is a hammer that disappointed or bored people use to club someone
else.
 Woollcott’s critique of moralists comes through clearly when he refers to “the Busy
Body (which is in every one of us) all dressed up and nowhere to go” (lines 11–12). His
irony is evident when he cites “all those good people who had had such a splendid
time keeping an eye on their presumably treasonable neighbors” (lines 10–11).
 Woollcott alludes to several common sayings, changing the wording just a bit to make a
satiric point. These sayings include “all dressed up and nowhere to go” (line 12) and
“having taken and relished an inch, it will take an ell” (lines 16–17). These allusions
emphasize that this “moral” stance is commonplace. And of course, Woollcott doesn’t
see this stance as moral at all.
Organization
This essay nicely fits a compare-and-contrast format. The introduction may cite each author
and explain his view of morality, perhaps in one or two sentences. One body paragraph tack-
les similarities (irony, diction, and use of examples, for example) and one tackles differences
(point of view and attitude). Or, you can devote one body paragraph to diction, one to tone,
and one to attitude. The conclusion in either format could address point of view, as
described in the earlier “Main points” section.
Overall assessment
The point that each of these passages makes is simple: Censorship is bad. (It isn’t exactly a
huge surprise that Broun and Woollcott feel this way. They’re writers, and they don’t like lim-
itations on their freedom of expression.) Because the content is relatively simple, most AP
essay writers will get it right. Therefore, the best way to stand out from the crowd is to do a
good job analyzing the techniques each writer employs to make his point. Specifically, a
good essay should discuss diction and tone. A fair essay hits only one of these two literary
elements, and a great essay delves into irony and hyperbole.

Killing Three Perfectly Innocent Hours:
Practice Exam 1
P
ut the cat in the yard and turn off your phone. Lock the door and throw away the key.
In this chapter, I’ve got you — or more accurately, the AP’s got you — for three whole
hours, plus one 15-minute break. Aren’t you thrilled? Okay, if you’re a normal person, you’re
not thrilled. But remember that these three hours, plus some time for checking your
answers, may make the difference between a good score and a great score on the AP
Literature and Composition exam. As someone in corporate America once said, “No bore-
dom, no gain.” Or something like that . . . 
This test consists of two sections:
Section 1: Multiple-choice — one hour. This section has a total of 55 questions and
counts as 45% of the exam score.
Section 2: Three essays — two hours. This section counts as 55% of the exam score.
Some last-minute instructions:
1. Make sure that anyone who’s likely to interrupt you (parental unit, friend, parole
officer) has been warned that you are not available until the test is completed.
2. Place a timer or a watch on the desk or table where you’re working. Set the timer
for one hour, the time allotted for the multiple-choice section.
No timer? Write the start and end time on a piece of paper and tape the paper to the
side of the clock. When wrestling a poem to the mat, you may forget exactly when
you’re supposed to stop.
3. Carefully tear out the multiple-choice answer sheet that precedes this chapter. Grab
a No. 2 pencil and indicate your answers by filling in the ovals that correspond to
your choices.
You may write in the margins of the exam, annotating as you wish. However, nothing
but the scoring grid and the essay forms will be graded. Answers or remarks written
next to the question will receive no credit.
4. After you’ve completed the multiple-choice section, get up and stretch for 15 minutes.
5. When your break is over, set the timer or check the clock for two hours, the time
you have to write three essays. Write your essays on loose-leaf paper.
On the real test day, you have to take the entire exam in one horrible morning or afternoon.
Resist the urge to chop this sample exam into bite-sized pieces: multiple-choice on Friday
night, one essay on Saturday morning, and the last two essays on Monday. You won’t have
the luxury of that kind of schedule when it counts! Face the AP grind as it truly is now so that
you’ll be better prepared later.

Five years have past; five summers, with the length
Of five long winters! And again I hear
These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs
With a soft inland murmur. — Once again
Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,
That on a wild secluded scene impress
Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect
The landscape with the quiet of the sky.
The day is come when I again repose
Here, under this dark sycamore, and view
These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,
Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,
Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves
’Mid groves and copses. Once again I see
These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines
Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,
Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke
Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!
With some uncertain notice, as might seem
Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,
Or of some Hermit’s cave, where by his fire
The Hermit sits alone.
These beauteous forms,
Through a long absence, have not been to me
As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye:
But oft, in lonely rooms, and ’mid the din
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;
And passing even into my purer mind,
With tranquil restoration: — feelings too
Of unremembered pleasure, such, perhaps,
As have no slight or trivial influence
On that best portion of a good man’s life,
His little, nameless, unremembered acts
Of kindness and of love. . . .

Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 
On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king
and queen of that country elevated in two arm-
chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The
whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance;
consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather
boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with
a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the
people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a
comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and
presenting on the whole a feminine appearance.
My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with
folded arms, and I could have wished that his
curls and forehead had been more probable.
Several curious little circumstances tran-
spired as the action proceeded. The late king of
the country not only appeared to have been trou-
bled with a cough at the time of his decease, but
to have taken it with him to the tomb, and to
have brought it back. The royal phantom also
carried a ghostly manuscript round its trun-
cheon, to which it had the appearance of occa-
sionally referring, and that, too, with an air of
anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of refer-
ence which were suggestive of a state of mortal-
ity. It was this, I conceive, which led to the
Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn
over!” — a recommendation which it took
extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted of this
majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared
with an air of having been out a long time and
walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came
from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned
its terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of
Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt
historically brazen, was considered by the public
to have too much brass about her; her chin being
attached to her diadem by a broad band of that
metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her
waist being encircled by another, and each of her
arms by another, so that she was openly men-
tioned as “the kettledrum.” The noble boy in the
ancestral boots, was inconsistent; representing
himself, as it were in one breath, as an able
seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergy-
man, and a person of the utmost importance at a
Court fencing-match, on the authority of whose
practised eye and nice discrimination the finest
strokes were judged. This gradually led to a want
of toleration for him, and even — on his being
detected in holy orders, and declining to perform
the funeral service — to the general indignation
taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a
prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in
course of time, she had taken off her white
muslin scarf, folded it up, and bried it, a sulky
man who had been long cooling his impatient
nose against an iron bar in the front row of the
gallery growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s
have supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was
out of keeping.
Upon my unfortunate townsman all these
incidents accumulated with playful effect.
Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a
question or state a doubt, the public helped him
out with it. As for example; on the question
whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some
roared yes, and some no, and some inclining to
both opinions said “toss up for it;” and quite a
Debating Society arose. When he asked what
should such fellows as he do crawling between
earth and heaven, he was encouraged with loud
cries of “Hear, hear!” When he appeared with his
stocking disordered (its disorder expressed,
according to usage, by one very neat fold in the
top, which I suppose to be always got up with a
flat iron), a conversation took place in the gallery
respecting the paleness of his leg, and whether it
was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given
him. On his taking the recorders — very like a
little black flute that had just been played in the
orchestra and handed out at the door — he was
called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia.
When he recommended the player not to saw the
air thus, the sulky man said, “And don’t you do it,
neither; you’re a deal worse than him!”

Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;
Nothing will know that you are gone,
Saving alone some sullen plough-land
None but yourself sets foot upon;
Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed
Nothing will know that you are dead,--
These, and perhaps a useless wagon
Standing beside some tumbled shed.
Oh, there will pass with your great passing
Little of beauty not your own,--
Only the light from common water,
Only the grace from simple stone!

Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 
I was born, I have lived, and I have been
made over. Is it not time to write my life’s story? I
am just as much out of the way as if I were dead,
for I am absolutely other than the person whose
story I have to tell. Physical continuity with my
earlier self is no disadvantage. I could speak in
the third person and not feel that I was mas-
querading. I can analyze my subject, I can reveal
everything; for she, and not I, is my real heroine.
My life I have still to live; her life ended when
mine began.
A generation is sometimes a more satisfac-
tory unit for the study of humanity than a life-
time; and spiritual generations are as easy to
demark as physical ones. Now I am the spiritual
offspring of the marriage within my conscious
experience of the Past and the Present. My
second birth was no less a birth because there
was no distinct incarnation. Surely it has hap-
pened before that one body served more than
one spiritual organization. Nor am I disowning my
father and mother of the flesh, for they were also
partners in the generation of my second self;
copartners with my entire line of ancestors. They
gave me body, so that I have eyes like my father’s
and hair like my mother’s. The spirit also they
gave me, so that I reason like my father and
endure like my mother. But did they set me down
in a sheltered garden, where the sun should
warm me, and no winter should hurt, while they
fed me from their hands? No; they early let me
run in the fields — perhaps because I would not
be held — and eat of the wild fruits and drink of
the dew. Did they teach me from books, and tell
me what to believe? I soon chose my own books,
and built me a world of my own.
In these discriminations I emerged, a new
being, something that had not been before. And
when I discovered my own friends, and ran home
with them to convert my parents to a belief in
their excellence, did I not begin to make my
father and mother, as truly as they had ever
made me? Did I not become the parent and they
the children, in those relations of teacher and
learner? And so I can say that there has been
more than one birth of myself, and I can regard
my earlier self as a separate being, and make it a
subject of study.
A proper autobiography is a death-bed con-
fession. A true man finds so much work to do that
he has no time to contemplate his yesterdays; for
to-day and to-morrow are here, with their impa-
tient tasks. The world is so busy, too, that it
cannot afford to study any man’s unfinished work;
for the end may prove it a failure, and the world
needs masterpieces. Still there are circumstances
by which a man is justified in pausing in the
middle of his life to contemplate the years already
passed. One who has completed early in life a dis-
tinct task may stop to give an account of it. One
who has encountered unusual adventures under
vanishing conditions may pause to describe them
before passing into the stable world. And perhaps
he also might be given an early hearing, who,
without having ventured out of the familiar paths,
without having achieved any signal triumph, has
lived his simple life so intensely, so thoughtfully,
as to have discovered in his own experience an
interpretation of the universal life.
I am not yet thirty, counting in years, and I
am writing my life history. Under which of the
above categories do I find my justification? I have
not accomplished anything, I have not discov-
ered anything, not even by accident, as
Columbus discovered America. My life has been
unusual, but by no means unique. And this is the
very core of the matter. It is because I understand
my history, in its larger outlines, to be typical of
many, that I consider it worth recording. My life is
a concrete illustration of a multitude of statistical
facts. Although I have written a genuine personal
memoir, I believe that its chief interest lies in the
fact that it is illustrative of scores of unwritten
lives. I am only one of many whose fate it has
been to live a page of modern history. We are the
strands of the cable that binds the Old World to
the New. As the ships that brought us link the
shores of Europe and America, so our lives span
the bitter sea of racial differences and misunder-
standings. Before we came, the New World knew
not the Old; but since we have begun to come,
the Young World has taken the Old by the hand,
and the two are learning to march side by side,
seeking a common destiny.

Chapter 16: Killing Three Perfectly Innocent Hours: Practice Exam 1
Eternities before the first-born day,
Or ere the first sun fledged his wings of flame,
Calm Night, the everlasting and the same,
A brooding mother over chaos lay.
And whirling suns shall blaze and then decay,
Shall run their fiery courses and then claim
The haven of the darkness whence they came;
Back to Nirvanic peace shall grope their way.
So when my feeble sun of life burns out,
And sounded is the hour for my long sleep,
I shall, full weary of the feverish light,
Welcome the darkness without fear or doubt,
And heavy-lidded, I shall softly creep
Into the quiet bosom of the Night.

Two of the three essays in this section are based on a literature selection supplied here; the other is
based on a literary work of your own choice. You may annotate the selections in this booklet, but
only what is written on your loose-leaf paper will be graded.
Essay 1
The following passage is excerpted from George Bernard Shaw’s play Major Barbara. In a well-devel-
oped essay, discuss how Shaw establishes the family relationships and conflicts in this, the opening
scene between Lady Britomart and her son Stephen.
Suggested time you should devote to this essay: 40 minutes.
STEPHEN. What’s the matter?
LADY BRITOMART. Presently, Stephen.
[Stephen submissively walks to the settee and sits down. He takes up The Speaker.]
LADY BRITOMART. Don’t begin to read, Stephen. I shall require all your attention.
STEPHEN. It was only while I was waiting —
LADY BRITOMART. Don’t make excuses, Stephen. [He puts down The Speaker.] Now! [She 
finishes her writing; rises; and comes to the settee.] I have not kept you waiting very long, 
I think.
STEPHEN. Not at all, mother.
LADY BRITOMART. Bring me my cushion. [He takes the cushion from the chair at the desk and 
arranges it for her as she sits down on the settee.] Sit down. [He sits down and fingers his tie 
nervously.] Don’t fiddle with your tie, Stephen: there is nothing the matter with it.
STEPHEN. I beg your pardon. [He fiddles with his watch chain instead.]
LADY BRITOMART. Now are you attending to me, Stephen?
STEPHEN. Of course, mother.
LADY BRITOMART. No: it’s not of course. I want something much more than your 
everyday matter-of-course attention. I am going to speak to you very seriously, Stephen. I
wish you would let that chain alone.
STEPHEN [hastily relinquishing the chain]. Have I done anything to annoy you, mother? If so, 
it was quite unintentional.
LADY BRITOMART [astonished]. Nonsense! [with some remorse] My poor boy, did you think 
I was angry with you?
STEPHEN. What is it, then, mother? You are making me very uneasy.
LADY BRITOMART [squaring herself at him rather aggressively]. Stephen: may I ask how 
soon you intend to realize that you are a grown-up man, and that I am only a woman?
STEPHEN [amazed]. Only a —
LADY BRITOMART. Don’t repeat my words, please: It is a most aggravating habit. You 
must learn to face life seriously, Stephen. I really cannot bear the whole burden 
of our family affairs any longer. You must advise me: you must assume the 
responsibility.

STEPHEN. I!
LADY BRITOMART. Yes, you, of course. You were 24 last June. You’ve been at Harrow and 
Cambridge. You’ve been to India and Japan. You must know a lot of things now; unless you 
have wasted your time most scandalously. Well, advise me.
STEPHEN [much perplexed]. You know I have never interfered in the household —
LADY BRITOMART. No: I should think not. I don’t want you to order the dinner.
STEPHEN. I mean in our family affairs.
LADY BRITOMART. Well, you must interfere now; for they are getting quite beyond me.
STEPHEN [troubled]. I have thought sometimes that perhaps I ought; but really, mother, I know 
so little about them; and what I do know is so painful — it is so impossible to mention some 
things to you — [he stops, ashamed].
LADY BRITOMART. I suppose you mean your father.
STEPHEN [almost inaudibly]. Yes.
LADY BRITOMART. My dear: we can’t go on all our lives not mentioning him. Of course
you were quite right not to open the subject until I asked you to; but you are old enough now
to be taken into my confidence, and to help me to deal with him about the girls.

Following these instructions are two poems, “Success,” by Emily Dickinson and “Not They Who
Soar,” by Paul Laurence Dunbar. Read both poems carefully. Then, in a well-organized essay, discuss
the attitude of each poet to success and the techniques the poet employs to convey that attitude.
Suggested time you should devote to this essay: 40 minutes.
Success
Success is counted sweetest
By those who ne’er succeed.
To comprehend a nectar
Requires sorest need.
Not one of all the purple host
Who took the flag to-day
Can tell the definition,
So clear, of victory,
As he, defeated, dying,
On whose forbidden ear
The distant strains of triumph
Break, agonized and clear!
Not They Who Soar
Not they who soar, but they who plod
Their rugged way, unhelped, to God
Are heroes; they who higher fare,
And flying, fan the upper air,
Miss all the toil that hugs the sod.
‘Tis they whose backs have felt the rod,
Whose feet have pressed the path unshod,
May smile upon defeated care,
Not they who soar.
High up there are no thorns to prod,
Nor boulders lurking ‘neath the clod
To turn the keenness of the share,
For flight is ever free and rare;
But heroes they the soil who’ve trod,
Not they who soar!

The Moment of Truth: 
Scoring Practice Exam 1
E
verything’s filled in and correct on your Practice Exam 1, right? Good. Close the book
and pull out the scuba gear. Take a swim and refresh your mind. Now you’re ready to
read the answers and explanations for Practice Exam 1.
Resist the temptation to cut corners when you check your answers. Read all the explanations,
even for the questions that you answered correctly. I’ve tucked some great information into
this chapter that will help you with the real AP exam.
First go through the exam, marking the multiple choice questions you answered wrong. Once
you’ve scored (stop snickering — I’m talking about the multiple-choice questions), use the
formula at the end of this chapter to convert your raw score into an AP grade. Take a good
look at the multiple-choice questions that you answered wrong. See if you can figure out
what types of questions trip you up (inference, vocabulary, tone, or literary terminology,
for example). Then go back to Parts II or III for extra practice in those areas. Next, read the
instructions for evaluating AP essays, and take a look at the sample answers and scores.
Now grade your own.
After you have a score for the multiple-choice section as well as for each of the three essays,
enter the scores on the conversion chart in the last section of this chapter to get your final
AP exam score.
Almost Like Drawing Lines in the Sand:
Scoring the Multiple-Choice Questions
This section has 55 questions. Check your answers, tallying the total you got right and the
total you got wrong (ignore the ones you left blank), and follow the steps for calculating your
multiple-choice score at the end of this section. (You should of course read the answer and
explanation for anything you left blank.) Then record your multiple-choice score in the sec-
tion “Putting It All Together: Calculating Your Composite Score” at the end of this chapter.
Individual answers
1. (B). Check out the meaning and the language of the poem (the diction) to figure out the tone.
The scene is “wild” (line 16) and the speaker refers to “deep seclusion” (line 7). Not exactly
Friday night at the local bowling alley, so choice (A) bites the dust. Nor is the speaker making
a case against a vacation at Disneyland in favor of a camping trip; therefore, no opposing
point of view leads you to choice (C). Choice (D) is out because even though the speaker is

thinking about quality of life, no detached, analytical point of view emerges. What’s left?
Nostalgic and regretful. The speaker tells you in lines 27–28 that “sensations sweet” have been
“felt in the blood.” Regretful is now out the door. Nostalgic, however, fits nicely with the look-
ing-back feel of the opening lines, “Five years have past . . . five long winters . . .” (lines 1–2).
Note: This excerpt from William Wordsworth’s poem “Tintern Abbey” is officially (and long-
windedly) called “Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey, on Revisiting the Banks of
the Wye During a Tour.” You don’t have to know the poet, the poem, or the artistic period
during which the poem was written (Romanticism) to answer an AP question. All the evi-
dence you need is in the poem.
2. (D). Here you’re looking for something that isn’t in the poem, and that something is apostro-
phe. In grammar, an apostrophe is the little hook that shows possession or fills in for miss-
ing letters. In poetry, however, apostrophe indicates words directed at someone who isn’t
in the poem (“O, Georgina, why did you dump me?”) or to an idea (“Loyalty, you never met
Georgina!”). Apostrophe, when used for an idea, overlaps with another poetic device, per-
sonification, when a nonhuman takes on human qualities. However, choice (D) wins out
over (B) because although the “plots of cottage-ground” (line 11) are “clad” (line 13) or
dressed, as people are dressed, the plots aren’t spoken to directly. Hence you have personi-
fication but not apostrophe.
To find the correct answer, you can also eliminate the two sound choices, (A) and (E).
The “murmur” in line 4 gives you onomatopoeia, the term for a word that sounds like its
meaning, and “little lines” (line 15) is one of many instances in the poem of alliteration, or
repetition of consonant sounds. Metaphor, a description created when one thing is equated
with another, appears in line 15 when the “hedge-rows” are called “little lines.”
3. (D). Lines 28–29 refer to the speaker’s feelings. The feelings are “unremembered,” implying
that the literal memories are absent. Choices (A) and (E) are out because nowhere does the
poem mention the willingness to remember or explain. Choices (B) and (C) are close, but
because neither mentions feelings, choice (D) is best.
4. (E). The syntax in the second stanza begins with a statement, that the “beauteous forms”
(line 22) haven’t been away from the speaker, as a landscape may be to “a blind man’s eye”
(line 24). The speaker has felt “sensations sweet” (line 27) because of the memory of those
forms. The long introductory statement in lines 25–26 (“But oft, in lonely rooms, and ’mid
the din / Of towns and cities”) simply clues you in to the time and place but tells you noth-
ing about “them.” Choice (C), nature, is too general.
5. (A). You can dump choices (B), (D), and (E) because the nature described in the poem is
ideal. You’re not going to swat a fly or step into a patch of poison ivy in this poem. Instead,
you’re watching “orchard-tufts” (line 11) and hearing “the quiet of the sky” (line 8). No criti-
cism anywhere! And choice (C) is out because an elegy memorializes something dead and
gone — not the case in this poem.
6. (C). Check out the first stanza. The whole thing takes you into a description of nature, minus
the mosquitoes that always seem to find me whenever I leave Manhattan. The second stanza
hits a high note: What the speaker saw in the natural setting helps when “weariness” (line 27)
hits in “lonely rooms” (line 25) in the noise (“din,” line 25) of urban areas. Furthermore,
nature influences the “best portion of a good man’s life” (line 33). The shift is clearly from
description to interpretation. Choice (A) is out because the first stanza isn’t melancholy, and
you can dump choice (B) because the whole poem is in first person. The diction doesn’t
shift, and the past and present tenses appear in both stanzas.
7. (D). The setting of the first stanza is a “wild secluded scene” (line 6). So who lives there? The
speaker mentions the possibility of “some Hermit’s cave” (line 21) where the imagined charac-
ter of the Hermit “sits alone” (line 22). Backtrack to the verb in this sentence (“might seem”
in line 19) and choice (D) becomes the best choice. Choice (A) fails because of that verb,
“seems,” and because you have no way of knowing anything about the poet’s experience.
Choice (C) is out because the poet says nothing about God, and choice (E) is eliminated
because the hermit is in nature, not a stand-in for nature. The most difficult answer to
254

eliminate is choice (B). The speaker clearly admires the rural setting and credits it with
improving human nature, but making the Hermit a symbol of the speaker’s desire is stretching
the point a little too far.
8. (E). Leave baseball bats and good sportsmanship alone here; in other words, drop choices
(B) and (C). Choices (A) and (D) are tempting, because the “sportive wood” (line 16) does
“run wild” (line 16). But if you choose (A) or (D), you’re saying that the “wild wood runs
wild.” Poets do repeat themselves at times, but in this case, “playful” gives a sense of child-
like innocence that’s more than justified by the idealized natural setting the poet presents.
9. (A). Blank verse isn’t, as its name implies, a series of empty spaces. Rather it’s the form of
unrhymed poetry that has ten syllables per line in an unstressed-stressed pattern known as
iambic pentameter. Here are the reasons why choices (B) through (E) don’t make the grade:
Free verse lacks regular rhythm, and this poem has ten syllables per line. A sonnet has 14
lines and all sorts of other features, including snow tires, which this poem doesn’t have.
(Check out Chapter 4 if you want to know the characteristics of a sonnet.) Ballads have
rhyme, and heroic couplets are rhymed pairs of iambic pentameter lines. Because this poem
isn’t rhymed, you can immediately rule out choices (D) and (E).
10. (A). Repetition always emphasizes an idea. The words “length” (line 1) and “long” (line 2)
add to the emphasis and also steer you toward statement I. How do you know how old the
speaker is? You don’t, so drop statement II. Statement III is tempting, but wrong because
there’s no indication of what the speaker has been doing in those five years that may have
caused regret or frustration about lost time. So you’re left with (A) as the best answer.
11. (B). All five answers are definitions of “slight.” In context, however, the word means insub-
stantial or “unimportant.” The word “trivial” (line 32) is a clue; you’re looking for a synonym.
Something “trivial” has little substance and is therefore “insubstantial.”
12. (E). The idealized natural setting rules out choice (A). The speaker does remember the past
and even reexperiences it in line 2 (“And again I hear . . .”). Therefore, choices (B) and (C)
are out. The poem refers to “vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods” (line 20) only to
make a point about the isolation of the area, not to press a social agenda.
13. (E). The “I” in the passage can be identified as the lucky ticket holder by the narrator’s close
observation of the actors’ performances. Choice (B) is a dud for exactly that reason. After
all, no one could quote the audience (line 26) without having attended the performance.
The Danish Court is clearly in the play, not at the play, so (C) bites the dust. The justified
criticism reveals that the narrator does understand Shakespeare and how the play should
(and should not) be performed. That leaves (A), but because the narrator says nothing
about wanting a role, (A) isn’t a good choice.
14. (A). Those born into the upper class, a category that includes Peers (nobles), aren’t likely to
have dirty faces unless they’ve just hopped off a polo pony after a particularly muddy after-
noon. “Risen from the people” (lines 7–8) means that the character gained nobility, instead
of being born in the right place at the right time. The other choices aren’t supported by the
passage, though I’m always willing to vote for a man (or a woman) “of the people.”
15. (C). I’m not sure what this actor did to his hair and face, but the narrator sees the effect as
unnatural (not “probable”) and wishes that the “curls and forehead” were more realistic
(“probable”). The unusual verbs in this sentence (lines 11–13) may have fooled you; the
second (“could have wished”) is a way of toning down the narrator’s criticism, and the
third (“had been”) expresses a condition that’s contrary to fact. Three answers — (A), (B),
and (D) — are wrong because they say the opposite, that the hair and forehead are good.
Choice (E) is far too general and isn’t supported in the passage.
16. (A). Process of elimination helps you with this question. Choices (C) and (E) aren’t in the
running because the narrator doesn’t like the performance. Choice (D) is out because the
passage doesn’t present you with a disconnect. (With irony you’re expecting one thing and
the opposite happens, such as when a letter carrier bites a dog.) Choice (B) is a possibility,
but the gentle criticisms of the narrator (“a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigan-
tic ancestor,” for example) make (A) the better answer.
255
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

17. (B). To succeed here you need to know some literary terms. You know that you’re in the ter-
ritory of symbolism when something in the story represents more than itself. Hyperbole is
exaggeration, as in “I spent a million hours studying for this dumb test.” Lines 3–4 claim that
“the whole of Danish nobility were in attendance,” which is clearly an overstatement. In this
passage, several things happen, including the spectators’ debate on Hamlet’s famous ques-
tion, “To be or not to be.” Choice (C) is voted off the island. Dialogue quotes what people
say, as in lines 58–59 (“Now the baby’s put to bed let’s have supper!”). Imagery appeals to
the senses. When authors describe information that you pick up through the senses (sight,
hearing, touch, and so on), they’re using imagery. This passage is filled with such details.
18. (B). A favorite trick of those who write the AP English exam is to ask for the meaning of a
word in context and then supply lots of other legitimate meanings of the same word as
camouflage. This question is a great example of this type of trickery. Everyone knows that
“nice” (line 47) may mean “friendly” (“she’s nice because she didn’t tell the teacher that
I ate her homework”) or “good,” “enjoyable,” or “admirable” (“nice to hear about your
nuclear fusion experiment”). However, few people these days know that “nice” may also
mean “neat or precise,” exactly the definition called for in this passage.
19. (E). The first paragraph of the passage describes the people on stage. The second includes
details about the actors, such as the late king’s cough (line 17), and comments about the
audience, such as the fact that they threw nuts at the stage (line 52). (These must have
been the same people who saw the latest James Bond movie with me.) The last paragraph
refers to one actor, but the concentration is on the audience’s reaction to his performance.
20. (E). This production relies on “two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table” (lines 2–3) to represent
the thrones of the King and Queen of Denmark. Not exactly Hollywood or even Indie-film
quality! Go for (E), the cheapest answer, and stay away from (A) and (B) because they 
suggest good financing. The boots appear to have belonged to an “ancestor” (line 6), so 
(E) wins out over (D).
21. (C). The queen is described as “a very buxom lady” (line 34), indicating that the actor shops
in the XXL department. The broad metal bands of the queen’s costume also appear in the
passage (lines 37–39) and are directly linked to the musical instrument. True, music shows
up in line 82, but it’s not directly related to the queen. The best answer is (C), which selects
statements II and III.
22. (B). The fact that the audience obviously isn’t very polite knocks out choice (D). Because
they’re throwing nuts at the stage and yelling at the actors, you can eliminate choices 
(C) and (D). They’re debating with each other and with Hamlet, so there goes choice (E).
Granted, they are certainly involved — referring to choice (A). The one thing the audience
can’t be called is well educated, as witnessed by their speech in lines 84–85 (“And don’t
you do it, neither.”)
23. (A). The narrator refers to “my gifted townsman” (line 11) and “my unfortunate townsman”
(line 61), so (A) is your best choice. No evidence for the other answers appears in the 
passage.
24. (E). Grammarians can have fun with this one (if they ever actually have any fun). They get
the correct answer by asking, “What or who will be heard?” The answer: “Sound” will be
heard. Yes, the subject here is after the verb — not the usual order of an English sentence,
but poets (who definitely have fun) like to play around with word order.
25. (B). All of the devices show up to the party except allusion, which is a reference to a work of
art, popular culture, or history that’s outside the poem. See Chapter 4 for more on allusion.
Enjambment, running lines of poetry together without punctuation, occurs at the end of lines
1 and 3, among many other spots. Personification, giving human qualities to a nonhuman,
shows up in the third stanza when “Spring will not ail nor autumn falter” (line 9). Assonance is
the repetition of vowel sounds (“Saving the may-weed” in line 13, for example). Alliteration is
the repetition of consonants (“rose and rhododendron” in line 1).
26. (A). The word “still” in this poem means, in a literal sense, remaining or continuing. But
“still” also means “silent,” and death is the ultimate silence. Finally, “still” means “not
moving,” again a characteristic of death. The poem is about death, so all three meanings
apply. Don’t you love poetry? One little word does so much work!
256
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

27. (D). The whole poem — a real jolly experience, isn’t it? — deals with death. The poem
addresses someone (“you” in line 2) and, in line 17, contemplates “your” death. Yup. Real
jolly.
28. (B). The poem deals with what happens “when you are dead” (line 2). Placing natural
images before and after those words emphasizes the naturalness of death. Choice (A) is out
because the plants are simply mentioned, not glorified. This fact also rules out choice (D),
because gardeners would want to hear something about how beautiful the flowers are.
Choice (C) is out because although plants are, by definition, fragile, the poem states that
the “rose and rhododendron” will still be around. (Clearly this poet hasn’t seen my house-
plants!) Choice (E) is out for the opposite reason: True, the plants endure, but their names
surround a statement of loss, so a sense of permanence isn’t what the poet is going for here.
29. (E). The fourth stanza says that when you’re outta here, only weeds, a “useless wagon”
(line 15), and a ruined shed will know. What do these items have in common? They’re all
undervalued. This stanza isn’t about ecology — choice (A) — or personal problems —
choice (D). The stanza contradicts (B) and (C) because the weeds will know you’re gone,
and if they know, nature is somehow affected by your death, so “uncaring” is wrong.
30. (C). The shed has “tumbled,” meaning that it’s in ruins. Choices (A) and (B) are alternate
meanings of “tumbled,” but in this context those definitions don’t fit. Choices (D) and (E)
make sense in the context of the poem, but unfortunately “rustic” and “natural” aren’t defi-
nitions of “tumbled.”
31. (A). The first four stanzas set up a number of situations in which the death being discussed
sounds like no big deal — it will still rain, the roses will still bloom, and only some weeds will
notice. Then whammo, the fifth stanza hits with the knockout punch: The death will take
“little of beauty” (line 18) away except “your own” (line 18), just “the light from common
water” (line 19) and the “grace from simple stone” (line 20). These references are to pretty
important stuff. After all, no one can live without water, and stone makes up the earth itself.
Both of these are natural, so stay away from choices (D) and (E). And time, or choice (C),
isn’t a factor.
32. (E). To answer this question you have to untangle the sentence in the last stanza. To state
the meaning simply: Little will pass when you die except the beauty of light from “common
water” (line 19) and “the grace from simple stone” (line 20). Water and stone, as explained
in the preceding question, are essential elements.
33. (C). Edna St. Vincent Millay, the author of this poem, called it “Elegy Before Death.” An elegy
is a lament for the dead, which this poem clearly is, even though the death hasn’t occurred
yet. A ballad has short stanzas with regular rhythm and rhyme, but a ballad needs a story,
and this poem doesn’t have one. A dramatic monologue presents a character — not the case
here. Sonnets have 14 lines and follow all sorts of strange rules — also not true of this poem.
Free verse has no regular pattern of rhythm and rhyme, and this poem does.
34. (B). This question gives you another chance to show off your knowledge of the fancy terms
English teachers (and AP exam writers) love. Figurative language departs from what’s real or
literal (“Helena was barefoot”) and moves into interpretation territory (“Helena’s feet wore
their birth shoes”). The first paragraph stays on the literal level, with straightforward state-
ments about the narrator. First person is the “I” voice, as in “I was born” (line 1). A rhetorical
question, one that no one is supposed to answer, shows up in line 2 (“Is it not time to write
my life’s story?”). A sentence with inverted structure flips the usual subject-verb-object order,
as in “My life I have still to live” (line 10). Parallel structure presents a series of sentences or
clauses with a repeated pattern. The first sentence in this passage (“I was born, I have lived,
and I have been made over”) is an example of parallel structure.
35. (E). The second sentence makes it clear that you’re getting “my life’s story” (line 2), so
choices (B) and (D) don’t make the cut. Nor does choice (C), because the subject — the
author’s life — is given. Choice (A) is a good one because the writer says she could speak
“in the third person” (lines 6–7), about the subject instead of as the subject, implying some
degree of objectivity. However, the winner is choice (E) because “her life ended when mine
began” (line 10–11), indicating that the writer has changed totally.
257
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

36. (C). The writer says her parents “gave me body” (line 25), a much more positive statement
than the I-didn’t-ask-to-be-born statement kids sometimes scream when their parental units
are being particularly annoying. Therefore, statement I is correct. The writer also claims
that her parents were “partners in the generation of my second self” (line 23), so statement
II stays in the game as well. Statement III is a dud, however, because lines 28–29 declare that
they didn’t set her down “in a sheltered garden.”
37. (D). Lines 34–37 show that the writer was given a great deal of freedom to explore and
choose her own path. Choice (A) isn’t supported by the passage; the writer may have had
more freedom than the kid whose parents sign up for a GPS tracking system, but a family
structure, even an unconventional one, may still exist. Similarly, you can’t assume that the
writer is challenging society. In fact, the “wild fruit” line implies that she’s ignoring society,
because “wild” is associated with untamed and uncivilized territory. Diet and poverty,
choices (C) and (E), are literal readings, and a symbol extends way beyond the literal into
imagination territory.
38. (A). At the end of the second paragraph, the narrator claims to have “built me a world of my
own” (line 36) after choosing “her own books” (line 35). In other contexts, “discriminations”
may refer to prejudices, injustices, perceptions, and differences. Here “choices” fits best.
39. (D). In lines 43–45, the narrator asks, “Did I not become the parent and they the children, in
those relations of teacher and learner?” This is a rhetorical question, one that has an implied
answer embedded within it, as in “Do you have time to take out the garbage?” In both cases,
yes is the only possible reply. Rather than criticizing her parents (choice A), the narrator
makes several positive statements, such as “The spirit also they gave me” (lines 26–27). 
The same line rules out choice (E). Choice (B) bites the dust because the fifth paragraph
(lines 70–94) justifies writing an autobiography before the major part of one’s life is over.
The same paragraph also declares that the narrator hasn’t done anything particularly
remarkable, so you can cross out choice (C).
40. (D). In the third paragraph, the author speaks almost exclusively about herself. In the fourth
paragraph, the author considers what constitutes a “proper autobiography” (line 49), a
much more universal concept. Incidentally, the author is a woman (Mary Antin, who wrote
about her life as an immigrant in the early 20th century). True to the customs of that time
period, she uses “man” and “he” to represent everyone, including females.
41. (E). Ah, grammar. Everyone hates it, including me (and I write grammar books!). But it does
come in handy from time to time. This question asks you to name the antecedent, a gram-
matical term for the word replaced by a pronoun. Read lines 76–79 and fill in the implied
word, and you’ll immediately see the antecedent: the author’s “history” is typical of “many”
histories. Bingo, choice (E) wins the prize.
42. (B). A metaphor is an implied comparison. It describes something by equating it with
another. The author states that “We are the strands of the cable” (lines 85–86) because 
“we” link the Old and New Worlds. Choice (A) would have been okay if the comparison 
had contained “like” or “as.” A symbol occurs within a piece of literature and adds meaning
from outside the work. Had the author been discussing an actual cable between, say, Europe
and North America, the cable might have been a symbol of unity. In this case, however, the
cable isn’t real. Personification occurs when something nonhuman is given human qualities.
Hyperbole is exaggeration.
43. (A). To figure out the purpose, you have to look at the entire passage, not just one section.
Most of this passage explains how the author views herself — as a person with two distinct
lives and as someone linked to her parents and to two worlds. The fourth paragraph dis-
cusses why someone may write an autobiography at a young age, but the fifth paragraph
comes back with a reason not stated in the fourth — that one life may represent the experi-
ences of many. The whole passage is clearly trying to tell the reader why the author is justi-
fied in writing about herself.
258
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

44. (D). This short but beautiful poem by Hettie Jones has personification, which is lit-speak for
giving human qualities to an inanimate object or any nonhuman entity. The “word,” which is
not a person, “dreams of leaving” (line 10). Hit the sound button for alliteration, the repeti-
tion of consonant sounds (“tip” and “tongue” in line 8). The whole first stanza (lines 1–3)
employs metaphor, an implied comparison. Equating “words” (the title) with “stones” 
(line 3) creates a metaphor. Choice (E) refers to the end of a line in which no punctuation
appears. The line break implies a pause, but the meaning runs into the next line or stanza.
Enjambment is everywhere. The only thing missing in this poem is onomatopoeia, the liter-
ary term for a word that sounds like its meaning.
45. (C). Here’s the thing about writing poetry: You get to break all sorts of grammar and punctu-
ation rules without penalty. In fact, poets often do so on purpose to create a specific effect.
In this poem the poet makes several distinct statements about words, but the lack of
punctuation causes the reader to run those ideas together and to ponder the connection
between them. Choice (A) is wrong because nothing in the poem denies meaning. Choice (B)
is a flop because the line breaks and the stanza separations tell the reader where a pause
is appropriate. Choice (D) drops out of the running because in line 9 the speaker does
acknowledge an inhibition, or self-censoring (“I hold it close”). Finally, choice (E) is tempt-
ing, but the line breaks, the stanza breaks, and even the hidden meanings of the poem may
all be seen as “barriers.”
46. (E). In this poem “change” (line 6) is a play on words, as in “here’s a dollar; you can keep the
change.” However, the poet isn’t really talking about money; therefore, choices (A) and (D)
aren’t appropriate. Nor does the poet refer to promises, so choice (C) is out as well. The
poet implies that giving “my word” (line 4) creates a change in the listener, a change that
the listener may “keep” (line 6). Choice (B) gets voted off the island and choice (E) wins.
47. (A). The third stanza (lines 7–8) talks about “a word” (line 7). The colon clearly identifies the
word as “love” (line 8). Therefore the “it” (line 9) that the speaker “holds close” (line 9) is love.
48. (D). One of the many wonderful things I love about poetry is its economy. A single word may
have several meanings, all of which add to the overall effect of the poem. In “Words,” author
Hettie Jones says that words “are keys” (line 1). Keys unlock or open, so you don’t have to
stretch too far to say that words may unlock or reveal mysteries. Therefore, statement I is
true. A “stanchion” (line 2) is an upright post, as in a fence, so words may confine. In the
second stanza (lines 4–6) a word is given away — a liberating act. That means statement II
is correct. Because words may be “stones” (line 3) and because at least one — love — may
be difficult to say, words may be a burden. Therefore statement III is fine. Choice (D) deems
all three statements correct.
49. (C). An important issue in the poem is the identity of “I” (lines 4 and 9 in this poem). The “I”
isn’t necessarily the poet. Lots of poets create a fictional persona, a character bearing the
pronoun “I” but distinct from the author. You can therefore immediately dump choices (D)
and (E). Choice (A) is tempting, because in a sense the “I” in the poem wants a change, and
change may certainly be an escape from a particular situation. However, choice (C) is more
directly supported by evidence in the poem. The speaker, for instance, keeps the word
“love” on “the tip of my tongue” (line 8). The love “dreams of leaving.” It has a desire to
declare “yes, yes, you’re the one I love.” Choice (B) has no support in the poem at all.
50. (C). Using metaphor, the first three lines of the poem define “words” (the title). The next
stanza (lines 4–6) cites a situation, as do the last two stanzas (lines 7–10).
51. (B). The “Calm Night” (line 3) is a “brooding mother” (line 4) and has a “bosom” (line 14),
which is a fancy word for chest. Thus night is personified, or given traits usually associated
with people.
52. (E). It’s yet again time to dust off your knowledge of poetic terminology, and this time, the
term is sonnet. A sonnet has 14 lines, an intricate rhyme scheme, and ten syllables per line
(though poets sometimes cheat a bit with the syllable count). If you take a close look at
James Weldon Johnson’s “Mother Night,” you notice 14 lines, an intricate rhyme scheme
(ABBA ABBA CDE CDE), and ten syllables per line. Sounds like a match!
259
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

53. (A). The first eight lines of this poem take place on a big stage, with “eternities” (line 1)
and “whirling suns” (line 5). You’re in the territory of the universe. The last six lines of the
poem are more personal, speaking of “my feeble sun of life” (line 9) and “I” (lines 11 and 13).
Choice (A) is the clear winner here. Choice (B) is bad because the whole poem uses figura-
tive language. Choice (C) doesn’t cut it either, because both parts of the poem deal with
death with more or less the same attitude. The poem’s diction, or word choice, is formal
throughout — ruling out choice (D). The first stanza contains visual imagery (“whirling
suns” in line 5), so choice (E) is out.
54. (E). Check out lines 11–12. The darkness in this poem is a stand-in for death. Choices (A)
and (B) are too extreme. The speaker doesn’t fear death, and so choices (C) and (D) aren’t
correct either.
55. (C). Did you notice all the positive references to death and all the equations between death
and sleep? In line 7, for example, death is a “haven,” and in line 8 it’s considered “peace.”
And, the speaker says he will “Welcome the darkness without fear or doubt” (line 12) and
hang out in the “quiet bosom of the Night” (line 14) when he dies. Maybe Johnson pulled an
all-nighter before writing this poem!
Multiple-choice conversion chart
To go from your raw multiple-choice score to a converted score, you have to subtract 1⁄4 of
the number of wrong answers from the number of correct answers. This process sounds
complicated, but it really isn’t that bad. Follow these steps to get it right:
1. Multiply the number of answers you got wrong by 1⁄4.
For example, if you got 8 answers wrong, your result for this step would be 2.
2. Subtract the result from Step 1 from the total number of answers you got right.
The answer is your converted multiple-choice score.
Continuing the example from Step 1, if you got 47 answers correct, your converted mul-
tiple-choice score would be 45.
Now that you have the converted multiple-choice score, enter it in the later section “Putting
It All Together: Calculating Your Composite Score.”
Clear as Mud: How to Score an Essay
The essays are trickier to score than the multiple-choice questions because you have to
make some judgment calls. But I know you’re up to the task, and in this section I give you
plenty of guidelines and samples to help you through the maze of AP-essay scoring. So
sharpen your pencil — and your brain — and get to work.
Before you score your essay, I recommend that you read the sample answers I provide in the
next sections — along with the explanations of the good and bad points of each — so that
you can have a clear path to follow when assessing the quality of your own work according
to AP standards.
When scoring the essays, use the following checklist to rate yourself according to AP
standards:
 Does the essay address the question?
 How in-depth is the literary analysis?
260
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

 Does the writer offer sufficient support for his/her analysis?
 What is the level of writing fluency shown in the essay?
Each item in the checklist has a range of scores. You have to pick one of the three numbers.
Here’s what to do:
 Give yourself the highest number in a scoring range if the answer almost, but not
quite, fits into the next higher category. In other words, if an essay just brushes the
7–9 slot, give yourself a 6.
 Likewise, award yourself the lowest number in a scoring range if an answer just
barely escapes the next lower category. Therefore, if you decide that one area
deserves a place in the 7–9 slot after toying with the 4–6 rung of the ladder, give
yourself a score of 7.
 If an essay appears to sit squarely in one category, go for the middle score. A solid
7–9 essay, in other words, gets an 8.
After assessing each aspect of an essay, add the scores for the four assessment questions
together and divide by four to calculate the raw score. An essay scores a zero only if it 
doesn’t address the question or if it’s left blank.
Only the lowest category (1–3) of the checklist for writing skills mentions what English teach-
ers call mechanics, or grammar and spelling errors. Dedicated grammarians (and I am one)
hate to admit that the College Board tells its exam graders to count grammar and spelling
errors only when the mistakes slap the reader in the face. (But of course, AP readers are high
school or college English teachers, so they’re going to notice when you make “missteaks.”)
The bottom line is this: Be careful with grammar and spelling. One more thing: Every English
teacher I’ve ever met gets grumpy when the characters’ names are misspelled. Check the
passage and your essay to be sure that you aren’t writing about Lady Britmart, Kmart,
Walmart, or any other mart. I guarantee that you don’t want a grouchy exam grader.
Essay 1: Family Relationships and Conflicts 
in Shaw’s “Major Barbara”
George Bernard Shaw, a British writer, was famous for dry wit and artful pokes at society’s
conventions. In this excerpt from Major Barbara, a family conflict is established in just a
few lines. Because this is a drama passage, you don’t have much beyond dialogue to work
from — just a couple of stage directions. However, the content and diction of each charac-
ter’s remarks offers a great deal of information.
Scoring grid for essay 1
Before you hit the following scoring grid, reread your essay. Underline spots where you might
have done better, and give yourself a star for sections where you excelled. Then work your
way through the categories in this scoring section, assigning yourself a number in each one.
Addresses the question: _____
The most important factor an AP grader looks for is, sadly, all too easy to overlook: address-
ing the question from the prompt. This prompt has three parts: the family relationships, the
261
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

conflict, and how Shaw reveals them to the reader. Choose the number from the following list
that best describes your essay:
0
The essay doesn’t answer the question or is left blank.
1–3
The essay merely summarizes the plot or meaning and contains only one or two
points that relate to family relationships and conflict or to Shaw’s writing style.
4–6
The essay contains some unnecessary plot summary but makes a few points that
relate to family relationships and conflict. The essay discusses one or two tech-
niques that Shaw uses to reveal the family dynamic. The essay may occasionally
stray from the topic.
7–9
The essay focuses on the relationship between Lady Britomart and her son and
the implied relationship of each to the father. The essay explores the conflict
between the mother and son and the implied problems with the father and the
girls. The essay analyzes Shaw’s writing style and avoids unnecessary plot sum-
mary and off-topic statements.
Literary analysis: _____
The College Board is testing your ability to pick apart a literary work and analyze its con-
tents. Scan your essay and then choose the number from this list that best represents your
analysis of Major Barbara:
1–3
The essay stays solely on the literal level, with no interpretation of the characters’
statements or actions. One or more statements about relationships and conflict
may be wrong.
4–6
The essay offers an interpretation of the characters’ statements or actions but
doesn’t go into depth. The family conflict is explained in simple terms.
7–9
The essay digs into the text, unearthing and exploring the interchange between
mother and son and their relationship to the father. The implied conflict with the
father and the problem with the girls are both included. The essay interprets the
dialogue and stage directions and also addresses what the characters don’t say,
as well as such elements of style as diction, syntax, punctuation, and so on.
Evidence/support: _____
No evidence, no case. That fact applies to the justice system and also to AP essay scores.
How much evidence have you supplied? Evaluate your response by choosing a number from
this list:
1–3
The writer makes only general statements with no or very few specific references
to the text.
4–6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The refer-
ences may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some quotations may
be overly long, too short, or not supportive of the writer’s point.
7–9
The writer provides strong support for his or her interpretations by choosing spe-
cific and relevant evidence from the text. Quotations are excerpted and analyzed
so that the idea the quotation communicates is made clearly and concisely.

Sample answer 1
Many playwrights show family conflicts and have various family members in several
types of relationships. George Bernard Shaw’s play “Major Barbara” is one play that reveals
family relationships. The family relationships and conflict between the two characters in this
scene, Lady Britomart and her son, are important.
Lady Britomart in this scene talks to her son Stephen. She tells him that it is time for
him to take a more active role in the family. She says that he must help her because she is a
woman and he is a man. Stephen is nervous during this conversation, which is shown when
he plays with his tie and then with his watch. Stephen doesn’t want to help his mother with
the housework, showing that he is in conflict with her. “You know I have never interfered in
the household —” Stephen is a man, and years ago men did not get involved with housework.
However, Stephen does not use this to argue with his mother. He seems willing to try, if she
wants him to, but that’s not what he wants. Although Lady Britomart says that she is only a
woman, she seems more powerful than Stephen, a man.
Lady Britomart is worried about her relationship with her husband. She asks Stephen to
help her with him. “My dear, we can’t go on all our lives not mentioning him. Of course you
were quite right not to open the subject until I asked you to; but you are old enough now to be
taken into my confidence, and to help me to deal with him about the girls.” She never says
what is wrong with the girls, but she wants Stephen’s help in some specific way. This is another
conflict in the story. Stephen, in the part on the exam, doesn’t ask how he is supposed to help.
The audience senses that Stephen will probably not know how to help.
George Bernard Shaw uses dialogue and stage directions to show the relationship
between Stephen and Lady Britomart. Stephen’s lines of dialogue are much shorter than
Lady Britomart’s. He says less because she is in control of him. Lady Britomart appears to
be a woman used to getting her way. She dominates Stephen by talking a lot. Lady Britomart
orders Stephen around when she tells him to put down The Speaker and listen to her. She
tells him to stop playing with his tie. She also says he has to interfere. “Stephen: may I ask
how soon you intend to realize that you are a grown-up man, and that I am only a woman?”
Stephen also walks “submissively” to a settee and sits down, showing that she is the boss of
him, even though the characters seem traditional, and the tradition is that the male charac-
ter will have more power than the female character.
Family conflicts are in every family, and the Britomarts are no exception. In the play
George Bernard Shaw uses dialogue and stage directions to show how the mother and the
son are in conflict and to show how they are worried about the father.

Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

Analysis of sample answer 1
In this section, I explain how I would score the preceding essay in each of four categories.
Addresses the question: 5
This essay does address the question; it stays mostly on topic, but it also includes some
repetitive or general statements. The introductory paragraph wastes a whole sentence on a
vague comment about literature: “Many playwrights show family conflicts and have various
family members in several types of relationships.” A better essay gets to the point about
Lady Britomart and her son and husband. Also, the sentences about male and female roles
aren’t tied to the question of family conflict and only vaguely show the relationship between
Lady Britomart and her son.
Literary analysis: 4
This essay makes a couple of good points: Lady Britomart is in control of the conversation,
and her son is nervous around her. (Can you blame him? As I read this dialogue, even I find
myself feeling guilty about fiddling with my tie — and I don’t even have a tie!) The writer also
notes that both characters are worried about the father. However, the writer stays on a fairly
basic level, mentioning these ideas without exploring deeper levels. Shaw’s writing technique
is mentioned, but the writer doesn’t dig into diction, pauses, or other details.
Evidence/support: 5
The essay pulls in some evidence in the form of quotations, but they’re simply plopped into
the paragraphs without any link to the preceding or following sentences. The quotations also
aren’t excerpted well. Unnecessary words such as “My dear” should be cut. The writer cor-
rectly makes some concrete references to the text, such as the tie and the watch and the fact
that Lady Britomart orders her son to sit down.
Writing skills: 5
A couple of mechanical errors show up in this essay. For example, the title of the play should
be underlined, not enclosed in quotation marks, and the quotations from the play aren’t
cited by line number. However, these mechanical problems don’t inhibit the reader. A more
important problem is the structure of the essay. Ideas discussed in the second paragraph
show up again in the fourth paragraph. These ideas should be combined. Also, the essay has
a summary, not a real conclusion.
Overall score: 5
Here’s how you calculate the overall score for sample 1:
5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19
19÷4 = 4.75 (which rounds up to 5)
Sample answer 2
George Bernard Shaw’s Major Barbara begins with a conversation between Lady Britomart
and her son, who is afraid of her. This point is emphasized when the stage directions say that
Stephen walks “submissively” (line 3) to the settee. He also stops reading when his mother
asks him to and plays with his tie and watch chain, which also shows his fear of her. He even
asks, “Have I done anything to annoy you, mother?” and tells her that if he did, it was “quite
264
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

unintentional” (line 20). Some of his lines end with dashes, showing that he is afraid to say
things to her. It is interesting that the magazine Stephen is reading is called The Speaker. It is
almost as if Stephen has to read about speaking because he doesn’t know how to speak for
himself with any confidence.
Although Lady Britomart says that she is “only a woman” (lines 25–26) and that Stephen
is a “grown-up man” (line 25), she doesn’t act as if she felt that Stephen has more power than
she does. Lady Britomart’s first line, “Presently, Stephen” (line 2) shows that she is in con-
trol, not Stephen. Many of her lines are commands: “Bring me my cushion” (line 10), “Don’t
repeat my words” (line 27) and “Don’t make excuses” (line 6). Her stage directions say that
she is “squaring herself at him rather aggressively” (line 24). Her speeches are also longer
than Stephen’s, again showing that she dominates the relationship they have between them.
Also, Stephen’s answer when Lady Britomart asks for his help is just one word: “I!” and the
exclamation point says it all. He can’t believe that his mother needs anything from him.
The family has some conflicts besides the tension that Stephen feels when he is with 
his mother and the exasperation she feels when she is with him. As soon as Lady Britomart
explains that she doesn’t want help to “order the dinner” (line 36), Stephen thinks of his
father, but he has trouble talking about it. (And he has stopped reading The Speaker!) His
lines are “troubled” (line 39) and he is “ashamed” (line 41). He can’t even say what the prob-
lem is, simply referring to “it” (lines 25 and 45). Yet Lady Britomart knows right away what 
he means, saying, “I suppose you mean your father” (line 42). Though the problem with the
father is never specified in this excerpt, the last line says that Lady Britomart wants Stephen
to “help me to deal with him about the girls” (line 46). So another relationship in the
Britomart family is in trouble in some way.
Shaw’s characterization sets up first a triangle (mother-son-father) and then a more com-
plicated relationship (mother-son-father-girls). The fact that the dialogue doesn’t give all the
answers keeps the audience interested, and the stage directions help the actors realize what
sort of people they are playing.
Analysis of sample answer 2
If you read the first sample answer and then this one, you immediately see that this one is
superior. It digs more deeply into Shaw’s scene, working from nuances that the first writer
didn’t notice. The following sections show how I would grade this essay.
Addresses the question: 8
This essay does address the question; it stays on topic and goes right to the point about
Lady Britomart and her son and husband. The writer discusses three family relationships
and mentions a fourth (the girls), explains the conflicts, and takes a pretty good shot at the
crucial part of the question — how Shaw establishes these relationships and conflict.
Literary analysis: 7
This essay crams in quite a few good points: Lady Britomart does dominate her son, and her
son is nervous around her. After a false start in thinking about the dinner order (takeout
tonight or pizza?), Stephen’s thoughts go directly to his father, and his mother is keenly aware
of that fact. A few aspects of Shaw’s writing technique are explored, including the length of
lines, the dashes at the end of Stephen’s comments, and the commands that Lady Britomart
gives to her son. The writer makes a nice point about The Speaker but doesn’t deal with dic-
tion. And wouldn’t you say that the words in the excerpt are quite formal for a family argu-
ment? Nor does the writer address anything that these characters don’t say, such as all that
Stephen leaves out in lines 39–41. Still, in a 40-minute essay, this writer achieved a great deal.
265
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

Evidence/support: 8
The essay uses quotations effectively, choosing just the right sections to make the point and
leaving out irrelevant words. Every statement about the play (“Many of her lines are com-
mands,” for example), is backed up with a quotation. This writer (like the writer of sample 1)
also makes references to the tie and the watch.
Writing skills: 7
This writer created a logical structure and shows a good, though not excellent, command
of language. The introductory paragraph gets right to the point, but no overall statement
indicates what the essay is about. In other words, the writer didn’t include a thesis. The con-
clusion isn’t very sophisticated, but it is a real conclusion, not a summary. The essay has
very few mechanical problems.
Overall score: 8
Here’s how you calculate the overall score for sample 2:
8 + 7 + 8 + 7 = 30
30÷4 = 7.5 (which rounds up to 8)
Essay 2: Dickinson’s and Dunbar’s 
Attitudes toward Success
Paired poems appear fairly often on the AP English exam, and these two are a typical match
because each author has a distinct style and view of a common subject, in this case, the
meaning of success.
Scoring grid for essay 2
As real AP graders do, review the poems and your essay about them before hitting the follow-
ing scoring grid. If you’re starting the essay-grading process with this essay, read the general
instructions earlier in this chapter before evaluating essay 2.
Addresses the question: _____
The prompt calls for a comparison of two elements: the poets’ attitude toward success and
the poetic techniques each uses to convey those attitudes to the reader. Use these numbers
to measure your skill in addressing the question:
0
The essay doesn’t answer the question or is left blank.
1–3
The essay merely summarizes the literal meaning of each poem and contains
only one or two points relating to the poets’ attitudes toward success. The essay
makes very few references to the poets’ writing styles. No attempt is made to link
writing style to meaning.
4–6
The essay focuses on the poets’ attitudes toward success, both stated and implied.
The essay discusses three or four techniques the poets use to reveal the poets’
attitudes toward success. However, the essay doesn’t always link the ideas about
success to comments about the poets’ techniques.
266
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

7–9
The essay explores the literal and underlying meaning of each poem, clearly defin-
ing each poet’s attitude toward success. The essay analyzes each poet’s writing
style and relates those techniques to the poet’s attitude toward success.
Literary analysis: _____
Especially in this essay, digging under the surface level of the texts is important, because in
poetry, the deeper level is where all the action is. Examine the literary analysis in your essay
with the following standards, choosing the number that best represents your essay:
1–3
The essay stays solely on the literal level, with no interpretation of the figurative
language, diction, or imagery. One or more statements about meaning of the
poems may be wrong.
4–6
The essay offers an interpretation of the poets’ attitudes toward success but
doesn’t go into depth. The link between what the poem says about success and
how the poem is written is explained in simple terms.
7–9
The essay digs into the text, unearthing and exploring the subtleties of each
poet’s attitude toward success. The relationship between the poet’s technique
and meaning is clearly established. The essay addresses such elements of style
as diction, syntax, punctuation, figurative language, imagery, and so on.
Evidence/support: _____
Quotations from the poems are essential in this essay, because you can’t refer to events in
the poems as you can when you’re writing about a story or a dramatic scene. How well did
you do? Check your essay and give yourself one of these scores:
1–3
The writer makes only general statements with no or very few specific references
to the text.
4–6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The refer-
ences may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some quotations may
be overly long, too short, or not supportive of the writer’s point.
7–9
The writer provides strong support for his or her interpretations by choosing
specific and relevant evidence from the text. Quotations are excerpted so that
the point is made clearly and concisely.
Writing skills: _____
You don’t have to be a poet to write about poetry, but you do have to present your analysis
of these poems clearly and logically. Evaluate your writing style and pick a number that fits:
1–3
The essay is disorganized or filled with distracting grammar and spelling errors.
Transitions between one point and another are awkward or missing entirely.
4–6
The essay has a logical structure. The writer’s thesis (main idea) and supporting
points are easily defined. The writing doesn’t always flow smoothly or may con-
tain repetitive or wordy statements. Quotations are inserted awkwardly.
7–9
The essay demonstrates clear, fluid style with a good command of language. The
essay moves from a clear thesis through supporting points, each accompanied by
evidence, to a logical conclusion.

Sample answer 1
In “Not They Who Soar” Paul Lawrence Dunbar says that people who aren’t successful
but who work very hard are “heroes.” The ones who “soar” are usually the people we think
are the best, but Dunbar doesn’t see it that way. He sees the people who suffer as better off.
They can smile on “defeated care” even though they aren’t successful. The ones who are
“high up”, the successful people, haven’t learned very much. The people who plod are
probably farmers because the poem mentions “sod” and “thorns.” They may be slaves, too,
because the “backs have felt the rod.” Dunbar rhymes every two lines, creating rhyming
couplets. So the ideas in the two lines are closely related. Dunbar also makes an allusion to
thorns, which makes the reader think about thorns in the bible. He also uses a metaphor
when he talks about “boulders.”
Emily Dickenson, on the other hand, thinks that the sweetest victory comes when you
think you haven’t won anything. If you have lost, you are agonized and clear about what
victory or success means. She probably lived during a war or had soldiers in her family.
Dickinsen has a lot of alliteration in the first stanza, which has many words beginning with
the letter s. She uses a metaphor when she calls success a “nectar.”
In a way both poets agree with each other. Defeat is not such a bad idea because you
learn from your mistakes. Successful people haven’t learned much about life and don’t appre-
ciate what they have. The way each poem is written helps give this message.
Analysis of sample answer 1
This writer tried, but the results fall short of perfection. In this section, I explain what’s good
and bad about sample 1 and show you the grades I would have awarded in each category.
Addresses the question: 3
This essay does address the question; it stays mostly on topic (attitude toward success) but
includes some off-topic statements about farmers and slavery in the first paragraph and about
war in the second. The poetic techniques are mentioned, but the essay doesn’t make any con-
nection between the way the poem is written and the attitude of the poet toward success.
Literary analysis: 3
This essay gets the main idea: People who succeed don’t appreciate their victory as much as
those who go down in defeat. However, the writer includes very little analysis beyond this
main idea of each poem. The literary techniques that the writer mentions are simply dropped
in the essay almost like a shopping list. The writer doesn’t consider how those techniques
work in the poem or how they affect the reader.
268
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

One clue that the writer of this sample is in trouble is the length of the essay — 265 words, in
case you’re interested. A good AP essay averages 450 to 500 words. This writer has come up
short in words and, more importantly, in ideas.
Evidence/support: 2
The essay pulls in some evidence in the form of quotations, but they’re just single words. The
writer misses a couple of great opportunities to quote whole lines and explore their relation-
ship to the idea of success. Also, quite a few more literary techniques and examples could be
mentioned.
Writing skills: 3
A couple of mechanical errors show up in this essay. For example, the comma in the fifth line
of the first paragraph should be inside the closing quotation, not outside. The quotations
from the poems aren’t cited by line number. However, the mechanical problems don’t inhibit
the reader. The essay doesn’t flow smoothly, but it isn’t bad either.
This essay contains a big no-no: The authors’ names are misspelled, and, in the case of Emily
Dickinson, in two different ways! Remember that your essay will be graded by an English
teacher or professor, and we tend to get very possessive about authors. So be sure to spell
their names correctly!
Overall score: 3
Here’s how to calculate the overall score for sample 1:
3 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 11
11÷4 = 2.75 (which rounds up to 3)
Sample answer 2
Emily Dickinson and Paul Laurence Dunbar both explore success and the meaning
attached to it by contrasting those who experience success with those who taste defeat.
Both poets agree that you have to experience defeat to know the meaning of success.
In Dickinson’s poem Success it is described as a “nectar” (3) that you can “comprehend”
(3) only when you have “sorest need” (4). Success is taking “the flag” (6), but the ones who
most appreciate success hear the “distant strains of triumph” (11) and are “agonized” (12).
Dickinson’s metaphors make success sound wonderful, because nectar is sweet, a flag is usu-
ally respected, and triumph is enjoyable. By contrast, the “defeated” (9) person who hears
the “distant strains” (11) is nearly dead. Success is so far away and so closed to this person
that they hear the success with a “forbidden ear” (10). Dickinson’s word choice in this poem
is very simple. Most of the words are easy to understand, implying that the main idea is a
simple, natural concept — you appreciate success when you have been defeated. Two four-
line stanzas with the second and fourth line rhyming also create a simple pattern, reinforcing
the idea of naturalness. The “purple host” in line 5 makes the reader think of bruises or
wounds, so Dickinson is telling the reader that success has its price. The “host” is also a reli-
gious image, making the experience of success or defeat an almost holy quest.
Paul Laurence Dunbar compares success with soaring in the air and defeat with working
on the land below. Dunbar doesn’t think that soaring is a big accomplishment. The “flight is
ever free” (13) for someone who succeeds, and they don’t have to face “thorns” (10) and
“boulders” (11). Dunbar makes allusions to the Bible, the “thorns” (10) and “the rod” (6)
make you think of the death of Christ, who has to wear a crown of thorns and who is beaten
by Roman soldiers. The rod also brings slavery to mind, another allusion. Dunbar’s last
two lines make the point: real “heroes [are] they the soil who’ve trod, / Not they who soar!
(14–15). Dunbar uses formal words, and his sentences are complicated. By making his
269
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

sentences complicated, he shows that the two ideas, success and defeat, are not as simple as
they first appear.
Dunbar’s poem is also about freedom and slavery, but freedom is a kind of success.
Dickinson and Dunbar both understand that pain and suffering is worth something, that you
can learn from your sorrows and tragedies. Those “who soar,” as Dunbar says, may miss an
essential part of life because they never taste defeat or even face obstacles.
Analysis of sample answer 2
The writer of sample essay 2 was on a roll the day he or she tackled it. It’s a fine effort, one
I’d be happy to see from any AP student. The following sections go into the details.
Addresses the question: 8
This essay does address the question; it mostly stays on the idea of success, and the poetic
techniques cited are related to the idea of success. The writer of this sample makes a correct
point in the last sentence: the poem is also about freedom and slavery. However, the question
asks for an alternate reading of the poem — success and, by implication, defeat. Thus the
essay would be better without that last line.
Literary analysis: 8
This essay makes quite a few good points. The general idea of the two poems is easy to
grasp. The essay writer digs into the text, unearthing deeper meanings, such as the signifi-
cance of “purple” (5) and the “forbidden ear” (10), the Biblical allusions in Dunbar’s poem,
and Dickinson’s word choice.
Evidence/support: 8
The essay uses quotations from the poem effectively, giving examples for nearly every point
made. The quotations are cited by line number in proper MLA format.
Writing skills: 7
This sample shows an effective and fluid style. The introductory paragraph states the thesis
and names the authors. A few grammar problems show up (for example, in the last paragraph
“someone who succeeds” is referred to as “they” instead of “he or she”), but the reader will
have little difficulty sailing through this essay. The writer had a good structure. He or she
included an introduction, body paragraphs, and a conclusion.
Overall score: 8
Here’s how to calculate the overall score for sample 2:
8 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 31
31÷4 = 7.75 (which rounds up to 8)
Essay 3: The Open-Ended Essay
By now you’re probably tired of grading — a sentiment your teachers often feel. But muster
up a little more energy to evaluate your third essay. Reread your response and settle in for a
grading session according to the categories in the following sections.
270
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

Scoring grid for essay 3
The open-ended essay is probably the easiest to write because you can work from a piece of
literature that you’ve studied in school and are ready to write about. (See Chapter 14 for
information on preparing for the open-ended essay.) However, because you may select any of
thousands of novels or plays, I can’t be very specific in this scoring guide. So here’s the deal:
I give you the general standards, and I provide two graded essays and explanations. Apply
the general scoring principles to your own work.
Three situations give you a zero for the third, open-ended essay. The first is not addressing
the question. The second is omitting the essay. The third is writing about a work that isn’t of
good literary quality. A few (misguided) exam-takers have composed essays on children’s
books or songs. Dr. Seuss is great, but not in this context. And stay away from Bob Dylan, no
matter how many votes you’d give him for Artist of the Century. Films and popular literature
(bestsellers) are also off-limits.
Addresses the question: _____
Even though the AP exam writers don’t tell you which work to write about, they do ask a
question. In this case, they want to know how one character in a literary work helps to define
another. Grade your essay’s response to this question according to the following categories:
0
The essay doesn’t answer the question or is left blank. The subject of the essay
isn’t a work of literary quality.
1–3
The essay merely summarizes the plot or meaning and contains only one or two
points about how one character defines another.
4–6
The essay contains some unnecessary plot summary but makes a few points that
relate to the way one character is in conflict with or in contrast to another. The
essay may occasionally stray from the topic.
7–9
The essay focuses on the relationship between two characters, showing how the
reader’s view of one character is shaped by the other. The essay avoids unneces-
sary plot summary and off-topic statements.
Literary analysis: _____
I hope you chose a work that’s like sandy soil: easy to dig into. Review your essay’s literary
analysis and assign it one of the numbers listed here:
1–3
The essay stays solely on the literal level, with no interpretation of the characters’
statements or actions. One or more statements about the characters may be wrong.
4–6
The essay offers an interpretation of the characters but doesn’t go into depth. The
comparison, contrast, or interaction between the characters is explained in simple
terms.
7–9
The essay digs into the text, unearthing and exploring the interchange between
the two characters or, if the characters don’t interact, the essay explores the
juxtaposition of the characters.
Evidence/support: _____
The case you’re making for character definition depends on references to both characters —
the one being defined and the one doing the defining. Grade yourself according to the stan-
dards listed here:
1–3
The writer makes only general statements with no or very few specific references
to the text.
271
Chapter 17: The Moment of Truth: Scoring Practice Exam 1

4–6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The refer-
ences may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some references may
not support the writer’s point.
7–9
The writer provides strong support for his or her interpretations by choosing spe-
cific and relevant evidence from the text.
Because you aren’t writing about a selection that’s provided on the test, you can’t easily
quote from the work you’re discussing. However, if you do remember some important quota-
tions (lines from a Hamlet soliloquy, for example), you’ll impress the exam grader. Don’t risk
a mistake, however. Quote only if you’re sure that you know the words.
Writing skills: _____
How does your essay sound? Does it flow smoothly, or do you stumble through a set of
choppy, half-baked sentences? Score your work by assigning it one of the following numbers:
1–3
The essay is disorganized or filled with distracting grammar and spelling errors.
Transitions between one point and another are awkward or missing entirely.
4–6
The essay has a logical structure. The writer’s thesis (main idea) and supporting
points are easily defined. The writing doesn’t always flow smoothly or may con-
tain repetitive or wordy statements. Evidence is inserted awkwardly.
7–9
The essay demonstrates clear, fluid style with a good command of language. The
essay moves from a clear thesis through supporting points, each accompanied by
evidence, to a logical conclusion.

Sample answer 1
Virginia Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway transverses two worlds in post WWI England — that of
Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Warren Smith. Both present a disillusioned unsatisfied view
of the world, and yet Clarissa chooses to live in the society whose worth she is unsure of,
and Septimus chooses to commit suicide. Though Clarissa and Septimus are not directly
linked, Septimus’s suffering and ultimate death cause her to reevaluate her own situation and
choose life. In this way, Septimus defines Clarissa Dalloway.
Septimus was an idealistic young poet who enlisted in the army as a symbol of poetic
patriotism. He married a beautiful Italian woman named Lucrezia and was a lively soul. He
suffered from shell shock and returned from the war unable to function as a normal human
being. He was not sad or angry — he was numb. He watched his best friend Evan die and
claimed to not have felt much sadness because he was already numb. Back in England, he
272
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

hears and sees Evans. His wife is forced to deal with his mental instability alone, and her
dream of a perfect family is ruined. She and Septimus are sitting in a park one day and she
comments on how they must appear — like a happy couple, when in reality, they can barely
communicate, and she has to hold him back from screaming random phrases about “human
nature.”
Lucrezia tries to help Septimus and take him to see two doctors: Dr. Holmes and Sir
William — both of whom cannot help him and represent to Septimus all that is wrong with
English society and, perhaps, humankind. He refers to Dr. Holmes as “human nature” and
jumps out of a window when Holmes tries to take him to an asylum. Sir William says that
Septimus suffers from a “lack of proportion” and tells Lucrezia, the only person who truly
cares for Septimus, that Septimus must be away from her as if she were the problem. Right
after Septimus kills himself — in hopes of saving his soul and not having to live in the society
he abhors — the doctors give Lucrezia drugs to effectively numb her. The doctors have
replaced what the war did to Septimus. One doctor then attends Clarissa’s party immediately
afterward, which is when the two stories cross and Clarissa hears of Septimus’s death. The
two doctors represent the uncaring position-obsessed English society and do not think
another moment of Septimus’s death except when it seems an interesting piece of gossip.
Upon hearing of Septimus’s death, Clarissa leaves her party and retreats into a room of
her own. There she contemplates why Septimus killed himself and how she feels similarly
to what he must have felt when he made that choice. Like Septimus, she struggles with the
balance of privacy and outside communication. She also dislikes society but has, thus far,
conformed to it and chosen to live in it. She looks through her window and sees an old woman
living her life. Clarissa ultimately chooses to continue living — to continue communicating,
unlike Septimus, in addition to having her own private room, her own private life. Septimus
could not. Clarissa returns to her party.
Though Septimus is only one man, he represented many of the returning soldiers and
disillusioned men and women who lived during the war. Society had no place for them; it did
not know how to handle them and chose to ignore their problems. Woolf contrasts this disil-
lusionment with the money-obsessed society of the rich elite, where wanton luxury has
replaced feelings and emotions. Though Clarissa chooses life, Septimus is the most moral
character at Clarissa’s party, and he defines the compromises Clarissa has made.
Analysis of sample answer 1
I love this essay. It isn’t perfect, but it’s a very fine discussion of one of my all-time favorite
novels. Here’s how the essay rates, according to AP (and my) standards.
Addresses the question: 8
This essay does address the question; it stays on topic and shows how the juxtaposition of
Septimus and Clarissa serves to define Clarissa’s character. The information about Lucrezia
may be omitted as it does not directly relate to the two characters being discussed, Septimus
and Clarissa.
Literary analysis: 9
The writer understands Mrs. Dalloway, and her observations about the two main characters
are insightful. The second paragraph nails the characterization of Septimus, mentioning his
relationship with his wife and the appearance of a happy family that’s belied by Septimus’s
inner turmoil. The third paragraph explains the symbolic meanings of the doctors’ treatment
of Septimus. The fourth paragraph turns to Clarissa Dalloway, analyzing her in light of
Septimus’s suicide. The last paragraph beautifully explains that Clarissa’s choice of life is
made in the context of Septimus’s death.

Evidence/support: 8
Because the text isn’t available to the writer, the exam graders won’t expect quotations. They
will, however, expect specifics, and this essay includes quite a few, such as the condition of
Septimus after the war, his random statements, the values of society, the doctors’ treatment
of Septimus, the reaction of Clarissa to the death, the old woman that Clarissa sees, and
Clarissa’s eventual return to the party. These examples come from various spots in the novel,
not just one place. Thus the writer has demonstrated an understanding of the whole work, a
plus on the AP exam.
Writing skills: 8
This writer has a strong command of language, with very few mechanical errors. The essay
gets to the point, moves smoothly from one idea to another, and comes to a logical conclusion.
Overall score: 8
Here’s how to calculate the overall score for sample 1:
8 + 9 + 8 + 8 = 33
33÷4 = 8.25 (which rounds up to 8)
Sample answer 2
In the play, Hamlet, written by William Shakespeare, Hamlet is contrasted with
Fortinbras and Laertes. The people who see Hamlet understand that the character of Hamlet
is different than the other two sons in the play. All three lose fathers. Hamlet finds out in the
beginning of the play that his father was murdered by Claudius. Fortinbras, the guards and
Horatio explain, lost his father in a war. He was killed by the old king, also named Hamlet.
Laertes’s father is Polonius, and Hamlet stabs him.
The three characters react very differently to the deaths of their fathers. Hamlet spends
most of his time worrying about revenge and his mother’s marriage to Claudius, but he 
doesn’t do anything until his mother dies. Fortinbras begins to invade Denmark, but his
uncle (another parallel to Hamlet, because Denmark is ruled by Hamlet’s uncle) tells him to
stop, and he does. Laertes is the most active character. After his father is killed by Hamlet,
Laertes tries to kill Hamlet at the grave of Ophelia. Then, when he is stopped, he agrees to
kill Hamlet in a sneaky way, in a duel that Claudius sets up. The only character who goes
right to revenge and is not stopped is Laertes. Hamlet stops all the time, whenever he thinks
of an excuse. Laertes and Fortinbras define Hamlet by showing that a real man, who is sad
because of an unjust death, will act and Hamlet doesn’t.
The other two characters also contrast with Hamlet by the way they deal with power.
Laertes is respectful to Claudius and to his father, early in the play. After his father dies,
Laertes is willing to kill whoever did it, even if it was Claudius, and he speaks to Claudius
angrily. Fortinbras is only on stage for a little while, at the end, but he respects the dead
prince, Hamlet, and says that Hamlet would have been a good king. Hamlet, on the other
hand, is disrespectful to Claudius throughout the play. Hamlet looks more disrespectful
because the other two characters contrast with him.
Analysis of sample answer 2
Hamlet is a great work of literature, but sample 2 isn’t a great essay. The writer certainly read
the play, but he or she appears to have rested comfortably on the surface, following the plot
but not the essence of Shakespeare’s drama. Following are specifics on the essay’s merits
and weaknesses.
274
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

Addresses the question: 4
The writer of this sample makes a crucial and fairly common mistake. Instead of dealing with
two characters, as the question specifies, the writer can’t resist throwing in a third. Yes, the
essay discusses how Hamlet is defined by another character, but instead of sticking with
Laertes, the best foil for Hamlet, the writer plops Fortinbras into the mix. Bad idea. First of
all, exam writers — and exam graders — tell you what to do and then expect you to obey.
Not fair, perhaps, but true. Second, the writer’s points about Fortinbras aren’t great. How can
they be when the character shows up only in the last scene? Fortinbras is discussed by other
characters, but the limited time given for this essay would have been better spent analyzing
Laertes and Hamlet.
Literary analysis: 4
Sample 2 makes a couple of good points about Hamlet — his lack of action in comparison to
Laertes’s rush to vengeance and Hamlet’s disrespect for authority. However, this essay con-
veniently ignores the fact that the authority in question, Claudius, got there by murdering the
previous authority, Hamlet’s father. The information about Fortinbras, while not called for, is
accurate. The reader definitely won’t drown in the literary depth of this essay, even if he or
she wears lead weights and has no idea how to swim.
Evidence/support: 3
This essay has no quotations (not even “To be or not to be”!), but you can’t expect quota-
tions without a text to work from. However, the graders do expect some specific facts from
the work. Everything in sample 2 is general. The writer doesn’t speak about Laertes’s fight at
Ophelia’s grave, Hamlet’s chance to kill Claudius when Claudius is praying, or any other
events. The details just aren’t there.
Writing skills: 4
This writer hasn’t created a fluent, graceful sentence. Not even one! Just read the first sentence
aloud. Hear the choppiness? The essay is readable, but there are several grammar mistakes.
Overall score: 4
Here’s how to calculate the overall score for sample 2:
4 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 15
15÷4 = 3.75 (which rounds up to 4)
Putting It All Together: Calculating 
Your Composite Score
The AP exam is weighted: 45 percent of your score comes from the multiple-choice questions
and 55 percent from the three essays. The AP statistics experts take the overall scores from
each section and fiddle with them a bit more until they come up with five categories, which
are called (drum roll, please!) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Plug your numbers into the following formula.
Then add up the right-hand column to see how you rate:
Multiple-choice overall score _____ × 1.25 = _____
Essay 1 score _____ × 3.1 = _____
Essay 2 score _____ × 3.1 = _____
Essay 3 score _____ × 3.1 = _____

Practice Exam 2
B
ecause most people count up from one, I’m assuming that you’ve already taken the
practice exam in Chapter 16 and checked your results in Chapter 17. If you’re the
unconventional type, no worries. The practice exam in this chapter is equivalent to the one
in Chapter 16. It doesn’t matter which one you do first. Though if you count down from two
to one, I think I’ll pass on your offer to balance my checkbook.
If you have taken the first practice exam, you know the drill: simulate real test conditions and
follow the timing carefully. Also, be sure to look over the corrected first exam before starting
the second one. Figure out where you need improvement. As you work through this exam,
devote extra attention to those areas.
If this is your first attempt to take the AP exam, Chapter 16 begins with a list of pretest prepa-
rations. Check it out before you start this exam.

Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 
On day three forty-seven of Ellic Camel’s
sentence,
Miss Allie took me to see the opener at Camp
Field.
Four guards lined the outfield; one behind the
umpire, one by
the foul pole, one in the bird’s eye, one just over
the mound.
On the first base side was the Gibson drive-in,
where we got
hot dogs and cotton candy for a quarter. Free
colas
were given out after every home run. And just
behind
the backstop Roy Jowers sold corn liquor1 in Ball
fruit jars.2
The place was packed, kids and old folks. Adults
cost a dollar,
kids fifty cent. And if you wanted a spot in the
shade,
under the tin roof, it was two dollars. Most time
we sat
outside. Sometimes that hot silver tin would just
bake your head.
That day Ellic Camel got a big hit and everyone
cheered him on. He was barreling around second,
headed
for third, a standing triple, but he just kept on
running,
out of the base path, by the dugout, and through
the entrance.
Somebody left the gate open and Ellic just took
off.
The umpire called him out, but he just kept on.
And when he
was about ten yards outside the fence, the fans
all sucked air,
it sounded like the whole stadium was left on one
wing.
No one said anything and all the guards just
watched him go.
Like a match dropped in dry woods, the fans rose
up, one by one,
cheering till the whole place went up in flames.
Jack “the runner”
began taking bets and almost everyone took him
up.
We were glad. We forgot what he did and we did
not care.
From nowhere rang a hammer.3 He went down
wriggling, plucked
in half. His hands gripped dirt. The crowd was
dead. He was dead. I
died. And Jack “the runner” jingled change in a
coffee can.
1. An alcoholic beverage.
2. Jars used for home-canning.
3. The mechanism that causes a gun to fire.

was nothing short of a miracle to see one’s only
son safe past the Siren Isle and in the haven of a
blameless domesticity.
All this Mrs. Archer felt, and her son knew
she felt; but he knew also that she had been per-
turbed by the premature announcement of his
engagement, or rather by its cause; and it was
for that reason — because on the whole he was
a tender and indulgent master — that he had
stayed at home that evening. “It’s not that I don’t
approve of the Mingotts’ esprit de corps; but why
Newland’s engagement should be mixed up with
that Olenska woman’s comings and goings I don’t
see,” Mrs. Archer grumbled to Janey, the only wit-
ness of her slight lapses from perfect sweetness.
She had behaved beautifully — and in beauti-
ful behaviour she was unsurpassed — during the
call on Mrs. Welland; but Newland knew (and his
betrothed doubtless guessed) that all through
the visit she and Janey were nervously on the
watch for Madame Olenska’s possible intrusion;
and when they left the house together she had
permitted herself to say to her son: “I’m thankful
that Augusta Welland received us alone.”
These indications of inward disturbance
moved Archer the more that he too felt that the
Mingotts had gone a little too far. But, as it was
against all the rules of their code that the mother
and son should ever allude to what was upper-
most in their thoughts, he simply replied: “Oh,
well, there’s always a phase of family parties to
be gone through when one gets engaged, and the
sooner it’s over the better.” At which his mother
merely pursed her lips under the lace veil that
hung down from her grey velvet bonnet trimmed
with frosted grapes.
Her revenge, he felt — her lawful revenge —
would be to “draw” Mr. Jackson that evening on
the Countess Olenska; and, having publicly done
his duty as a future member of the Mingott clan,
the young man had no objection to hearing the
lady discussed in private — except that the sub-
ject was already beginning to bore him.
Mr. Jackson had helped himself to a slice of
the tepid filet which the mournful butler had
handed him with a look as skeptical as his own,
and had rejected the mushroom sauce after a
scarcely perceptible sniff. He looked baffled and
hungry, and Archer reflected that he would prob-
ably finish his meal on Ellen Olenska.
Mr. Jackson leaned back in his chair, and
glanced up at the candlelit Archers, Newlands
and Van der Luydens hanging in dark frames on
the dark walls.
“Ah, how your grandfather Archer loved a
good dinner, my dear Newland!” he said, his eyes

on the portrait of a plump full-chested young man
in a stock and a blue coat, with a view of a white-
columned country-house behind him. “Well —
well — well . . . I wonder what he would have said
to all these foreign marriages!”
Mrs. Archer ignored the allusion to the
ancestral cuisine and Mr. Jackson continued with
deliberation: “No, she was NOT at the ball.”
“Ah —” Mrs. Archer murmured, in a tone that
implied: “She had that decency.”
“Perhaps the Beauforts don’t know her,”
Janey suggested, with her artless malice.
Mr. Jackson gave a faint sip, as if he had
been tasting invisible Madeira. “Mrs. Beaufort
may not — but Beaufort certainly does, for she
was seen walking up Fifth Avenue this afternoon
with him by the whole of New York.”
“Mercy —” moaned Mrs. Archer, evidently
perceiving the uselessness of trying to ascribe
the actions of foreigners to a sense of delicacy.
“I wonder if she wears a round hat or a
bonnet in the afternoon,” Janey speculated. “At
the Opera I know she had on dark blue velvet,
perfectly plain and flat — like a night-gown.”
“Janey!” said her mother; and Miss Archer
blushed and tried to look audacious.
“It was, at any rate, in better taste not to go
to the ball,” Mrs. Archer continued.
A spirit of perversity moved her son to rejoin:
“I don’t think it was a question of taste with her.
May said she meant to go, and then decided that
the dress in question wasn’t smart enough.”
Mrs. Archer smiled at this confirmation of
her inference. “Poor Ellen,” she simply remarked;
adding compassionately: “We must always bear
in mind what an eccentric bringing-up Medora
Manson gave her. What can you expect of a girl
who was allowed to wear black satin at her
coming-out ball?”
“Ah — don’t I remember her in it!” said
Mr. Jackson; adding: “Poor girl!” in the tone of
one who, while enjoying the memory, had fully
understood at the time what the sight portended.

Questions 23–30 are based on the following
poem, entitled “Good Hours,” by Robert Frost.
I had for my winter evening walk —
No one at all with whom to talk,
But I had the cottages in a row
Up to their shining eyes in snow.
And I thought I had the folk within:
I had the sound of a violin;
I had a glimpse through curtain laces
Of youthful forms and youthful faces.
I had such company outward bound.
I went till there were no cottages found.
I turned and repented, but coming back
I saw no window but that was black.
Over the snow my creaking feet
Disturbed the slumbering village street
Like profanation, by your leave,
At ten o’clock of a winter eve.

Questions 31–35 are based on the poem
“Aphasia” by Abby Wender. Note: “Aphasia”
is a condition in which a person is unable to
speak.
Like a worm in a robin’s beak,
today a word in my mouth squiggled away.
My student’s eyes were brown
with gold and green flecks
and the lashes
precise strokes of black paint,
like a portrait in a quiet, empty gallery.
I stood before her face
and the word would not come back,
it seemed to spiral
the way a twig does
when you throw it off a little bridge,
the gulf between us growing faster and faster,
the twig rushing away from me.
Questions 36-46 are based on the following
excerpt from Jacob’s Room by Virginia Woolf.
Mrs. Jarvis walked on the moor when she
was unhappy, going as far as a certain saucer-
shaped hollow, though she always meant to go to
a more distant ridge; and there she sat down, and
took out the little book hidden beneath her cloak
and read a few lines of poetry, and looked about
her. She was not very unhappy, and, seeing that
she was forty-five, never perhaps would be very
unhappy, desperately unhappy that is, and leave
her husband, and ruin a good man’s career, as
she sometimes threatened.

Still there is no need to say what risks a cler-
gyman’s wife runs when she walks on the moor.
Short, dark, with kindling eyes, a pheasant’s
feather in her hat, Mrs. Jarvis was just the sort of
woman to lose her faith upon the moors — to
confound her God with the universal that is —
but she did not lose her faith, did not leave her
husband, never read her poem through, and went
on walking the moors, looking at the moon
behind the elm trees, and feeling as she sat on
the grass high above Scarborough . . . Yes, yes,
when the lark soars; when the sheep, moving a
step or two onwards, crop the turf, and at the
same time set their bells tinkling; when the
breeze first blows, then dies down, leaving the
cheek kissed; when the ships on the sea below
seem to cross each other and pass on as if drawn
by an invisible hand; when there are distant con-
cussions in the air and phantom horsemen gal-
loping, ceasing; when the horizon swims blue,
green, emotional — then Mrs. Jarvis, heaving a
sigh, thinks to herself, “If only some one could
give me . . . if I could give some one . . . “ But she
does not know what she wants to give, nor who
could give it her.

My principal endeavour was to learn the lan-
guage, which my master (for so I shall henceforth
call him), and his children, and every servant of
his house, were desirous to teach me; for they
looked upon it as a prodigy, that a brute animal
should discover such marks of a rational crea-
ture. I pointed to every thing, and inquired the
name of it, which I wrote down in my journal-
book when I was alone, and corrected my bad
accent by desiring those of the family to pro-
nounce it often. In this employment, a sorrel nag,
one of the under-servants, was very ready to
assist me.
In speaking, they pronounced through the
nose and throat, and their language approaches
nearest to the High-Dutch, or German, of any I
know in Europe; but is much more graceful and
significant. The emperor Charles V made almost
the same observation, when he said “that if
he were to speak to his horse, it should be in
High-Dutch.”
The curiosity and impatience of my master
were so great, that he spent many hours of his
leisure to instruct me. He was convinced (as he
afterwards told me) that I must be a Yahoo; but
my teachableness, civility, and cleanliness, aston-
ished him; which were qualities altogether oppo-
site to those animals. He was most perplexed
about my clothes, reasoning sometimes with him-
self, whether they were a part of my body: for I
never pulled them off till the family were asleep,
and got them on before they waked in the morn-
ing. My master was eager to learn “whence I
came; how I acquired those appearances of
reason, which I discovered in all my actions; and
to know my story from my own mouth, which he
hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency
I made in learning and pronouncing their words
and sentences.” To help my memory, I formed all
I learned into the English alphabet, and writ the
words down, with the translations. This last, after
some time, I ventured to do in my master’s pres-
ence. It cost me much trouble to explain to him
what I was doing; for the inhabitants have not the
least idea of books or literature.
In about ten weeks’ time, I was able to under-
stand most of his questions; and in three months,
could give him some tolerable answers. He was
extremely curious to know “from what part of the
country I came, and how I was taught to imitate a
rational creature; because the Yahoos (whom he
saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands, and
face, that were only visible), with some appear-
ance of cunning, and the strongest disposition to
mischief, were observed to be the most unteach-
able of all brutes.” I answered, “that I came over

the sea, from a far place, with many others of my
own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the
bodies of trees: that my companions forced me to
land on this coast, and then left me to shift for
myself.” It was with some difficulty, and by the
help of many signs, that I brought him to under-
stand me. He replied, “that I must needs be mis-
taken, or that I said the thing which was not;” for
they have no word in their language to express
lying or falsehood. “He knew it was impossible
that there could be a country beyond the sea, or
that a parcel of brutes could move a wooden
vessel whither they pleased upon water. He was
sure no Houyhnhnm alive could make such a
vessel, nor would trust Yahoos to manage it.”
The word Houyhnhnm, in their tongue, signi-
fies a horse, and, in its etymology, the perfection
of nature. I told my master, “that I was at a loss
for expression, but would improve as fast as I
could; and hoped, in a short time, I should be
able to tell him wonders.” He was pleased to
direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the
servants of the family, to take all opportunities of
instructing me; and every day, for two or three
hours, he was at the same pains himself. Several
horses and mares of quality in the neighbour-
hood came often to our house, upon the report
spread of “a wonderful Yahoo, that could speak
like a Houyhnhnm, and seemed, in his words and
actions, to discover some glimmerings of
reason.” These delighted to converse with me:
they put many questions, and received such
answers as I was able to return. By all these
advantages I made so great a progress, that, in
five months from my arrival I understood what-
ever was spoken, and could express myself toler-
ably well.

only what is written on your loose-leaf paper.
Essay 1
The following passage is taken from Harriet Jacobs’s autobiography, Incidents in the Life of a Slave
Girl, Written by Herself. This excerpt takes place just after Jacobs was compelled to flee from her
owner, Dr. Flint. In it Jacobs describes her hiding place, a crawl-space in an attic, where she lived
for seven years before escaping to the North. In a well-developed essay, explain the techniques
Jacobs employs to further her cause, the abolition of slavery. In your answer, consider the intended
audience for this autobiography.
Suggested time you should devote to this essay: 40 minutes.
A small shed had been added to my grandmother’s house years ago. Some boards were laid
across the joists at the top, and between these boards and the roof was a very small garret, never
occupied by any thing but rats and mice. It was a pent roof, covered with nothing but shingles,
according to the southern custom for such buildings. The garret was only nine feet long and seven
wide. The highest part was three feet high, and sloped down abruptly to the loose board floor.
There was no admission for either light or air. My uncle Phillip, who was a carpenter, had very
skillfully made a concealed trap-door, which communicated with the storeroom. He had been
doing this while I was waiting in the swamp. The storeroom opened upon a piazza. To this hole I
was conveyed as soon as I entered the house. The air was stifling; the darkness total. A bed had
been spread on the floor. I could sleep quite comfortably on one side; but the slope was so
sudden that I could not turn on my other without hitting the roof. The rats and mice ran over my
bed; but I was weary, and I slept such sleep as the wretched may, when a tempest has passed over
them. Morning came. I knew it only by the noises I heard; for in my small den day and night were
all the same. I suffered for air even more than for light. But I was not comfortless. I heard the
voices of my children. There was joy and there was sadness in the sound. It made my tears flow.
How I longed to speak to them! I was eager to look on their faces; but there was no hole, no crack,
through which I could peep. This continued darkness was oppressive. It seemed horrible to sit or
lie in a cramped position day after day, without one gleam of light. Yet I would have chosen this,
rather than my lot as a slave, though white people considered it an easy one; and it was so com-
pared with the fate of others. I was never cruelly overworked; I was never lacerated with the whip
from head to foot; I was never so beaten and bruised that I could not turn from one side to the
other; I never had my heel-strings cut to prevent my running away; I was never chained to a log
and forced to drag it about, while I toiled in the fields from morning till night; I was never branded
with hot iron, or torn by bloodhounds. On the contrary, I had always been kindly treated, and ten-
derly cared for, until I came into the hands of Dr. Flint. I had never wished for freedom till then.
But though my life in slavery was comparatively devoid of hardships, God pity the woman who is
compelled to lead such a life!
My food was passed up to me through the trap-door my uncle had contrived; and my
grandmother, my uncle Phillip, and aunt Nancy would seize such opportunities as they
could, to mount up there and chat with me at the opening. But of course this was not safe
in the daytime. It must all be done in darkness. It was impossible for me to move in an
erect position, but I crawled about my den for exercise. One day I hit my head against
something, and found it was a gimlet. My uncle had left it sticking there when he made

It wasn’t necessary back when the hen kept her chicks close and they pecked at her
fecal droppings and they swallowed just the right kind of mother love, a touch of illness, a
taste of their own blood, and they trembled in sleep. Those days you could eat them with-
out a care. Maybe even find a dark spot near the pimply shoulder, a piece of quill, the
memory of a certain kind of flapping. The farmer’s wife wiped her hands on her apron
after she put the naked thing in the oven and she wiped the dirt off potatoes and she cut
the bread, and you were so happy and hungry you wanted to kiss her hands that kept
layer upon layer of so much world intact. And if something of that got into your mouth, it
was proof against the evil to come, the corruption of bodies. The cold touch of strangers.

the trap-door. I was as rejoiced as Robinson Crusoe could have been at finding such a
treasure. It put a lucky thought into my head. I said to myself, “Now I will have some light.
Now I will see my children.” I did not dare to begin my work during the daytime, for fear
of attracting attention. But I groped round; and having found the side next the street,
where I could frequently see my children, I stuck the gimlet in and waited for evening. I
bored three rows of holes, one above another; then I bored out the interstices between. I
thus succeeded in making one hole about an inch long and an inch broad. I sat by it till
late into the night, to enjoy the little whiff of air that floated in. In the morning I watched
for my children. The first person I saw in the street was Dr. Flint. I had a shuddering,
superstitious feeling that it was a bad omen. Several familiar faces passed by. At last I
heard the merry laugh of children, and presently two sweet little faces were looking up at
me, as though they knew I was there, and were conscious of the joy they imparted. How I
longed to tell them I was there!
My condition was now a little improved. But for weeks I was tormented by hundreds
of little red insects, fine as a needle’s point, that pierced through my skin, and produced an
intolerable burning. The good grandmother gave me herb teas and cooling medicines, and
finally I got rid of them. The heat of my den was intense, for nothing but thin shingles pro-
tected me from the scorching summer’s sun. But I had my consolations. Through my peep-
ing-hole I could watch the children, and when they were near enough, I could hear their
talk. Aunt Nancy brought me all the news she could hear at Dr. Flint’s. From her I learned
that the doctor had written to New York to a colored woman, who had been born and
raised in our neighborhood, and had breathed his contaminating atmosphere. He offered
her a reward if she could find out any thing about me. I know not what was the nature of
her reply; but he soon after started for New York in haste, saying to his family that he had
business of importance to transact. I peeped at him as he passed on his way to the steam-
boat. It was a satisfaction to have miles of land and water between us, even for a little
while; and it was a still greater satisfaction to know that he believed me to be in the Free
States. My little den seemed less dreary than it had done. He returned, as he did from his
former journey to New York, without obtaining any satisfactory information. When he
passed our house next morning, Benny was standing at the gate. He had heard them say
that he had gone to find me, and he called out, “Dr. Flint, did you bring my mother home? I
want to see her.” The doctor stamped his foot at him in a rage, and exclaimed, “Get out of
the way, you little damned rascal! If you don’t, I’ll cut off your head.”
Benny ran terrified into the house, saying, “You can’t put me in jail again. I don’t
belong to you now.”

Checking In: Scoring Practice Exam 2
I
n this chapter, you get to see how truly boring a teacher’s life can be. Take out your red
pen and get ready to score. Not the fun kind of score, such as in “the Dodgers win the
pennant!” but the annoying “is it right or not” kind of score. After you’ve checked your
answers, convert the raw scores into the proper AP form. This number tells you what score
you would have received had this been the real test. If you’re happy with your score, fine. If
you still have a micrometer’s room for improvement, turn back to the appropriate chapters
for a short, refreshing — okay, refresher — course.
Seeking Straight Answers: Scoring 
the Multiple-Choice Questions
This section has 56 questions. Check your answers and record the number of correct answers
in the “multiple-choice conversion formula” section. If you left any questions blank, simply
ignore them for scoring purposes. You should of course read the answer and explanation for
anything you left blank. If you answered any questions wrong (of course you didn’t!), enter
that number in the conversion section as well.
Individual answers
1. (C). Lines 1–26 describe the setting, Camp Field, with details such as the refreshments (“hot
dogs and cotton candy” in line 12) and the spectators’ accommodations (“hot silver tin”
roof in line 23). Though Ellic Camel is mentioned in line 1, his character doesn’t appear
again until the fourth stanza (line 27), so (A) is wrong. Ellic Camel’s character clearly isn’t
the primary purpose of the first three stanzas. Similarly, the guards lining the baseball field
are menacing figures, but they occupy only four lines of the first 26 in the poem. Therefore,
choice (B) doesn’t do the job either. Answers (D) and (E) are off base because urban base-
ball isn’t in the poem, and the conflict shows up a lot later, when the guards shoot the
escaping Ellic. Answer (C) is the best because the “unique event” — the shooting of Ellic
Camel — is firmly grounded in the setting established in the first three stanzas.
2. (B). Line 1 doesn’t give a lot away. For instance, you don’t know how long Ellic Camel is sup-
posed to be in jail, so answer (D) is out of the running. Nor do you have any idea why Ellic
Camel is doing time. Okay, you drop (C) too. Choice (A) is tempting, because someone has
been counting, but you can’t figure out whether Ellic, the spectators, or the speaker (“me”
in line 2) is keeping track of the days. Choice (E) strikes out — I know, I know, enough
already with the baseball puns — because line 1 gives you nothing but one fact: how long
Ellic has been in jail. Therefore, (B) is your answer, because line 1 focuses on Ellic and noth-
ing else.

3. (A). The corn-liquor business is illegal. However, (B) bows out because you can’t tell
whether it’s unfair that Jowers breaks the law and remains free while Ellic is imprisoned.
Why? Because you don’t know what Ellic’s crime is. Choice (C) is too extreme. The towns-
people may tolerate the corn-liquor trade, but to say that they have “no respect for the law”
isn’t supported by the poem. Choice (E) comes out of left field. (Sorry, I couldn’t resist one
more baseball joke. I’ll stop now. I promise.) Roy is selling, somebody’s probably buying,
and who’s to say he’s condemned? (D) doesn’t give credit to the one thing line 16 actually
does: show that the crowd is able to tolerate some illegal activity, an attitude that Ellic
Camel must share, given that he did something to wind up in jail. With this line, Camel and
the spectators are linked, and (A) wins.
4. (B). When Ellic goes down (line 56), he has been hit. So the “big hit” of line 28 — a double or
maybe a triple — foreshadows a fatal gunshot wound in lines 56–61. None of the other
answers are supported in the text. For example, you don’t know the score, so (A) is a dud,
and (C) is a loser because the crowd doesn’t cheer for Ellic in the same way until he heads
for the fence (lines 35–37). Choices (D) and (E) also aren’t supported in the text.
5. (E). Irony is easier to illustrate than define. When something turns out differently from what
you expect, yet there’s an element of “oh, that’s perfect” in it, you’re in ironic territory.
Think of a Web site condemning the Internet. (I actually saw one!) Ellic Camel is out —
out of the fenced-in field, out of the prison guards’ territory, and ultimately, out of his life.
However, the umpire’s statement refers only to the rules of baseball. How ironic. The other
choices aren’t a good fit. “Arbitrary” — choice (A) — means “because I said so” or “without
justifying reasons.” But the umpire does have a reason: Camel is out because he left the
base path. Nor is the umpire’s call “coincidental,” because his job is to make judgments
about the game. Hence (B) is a bad choice. The umpire also isn’t “critical” or “unfair”; he’s
just accurate in his call. That means choices (C) and (D) get eliminated as well.
6. (D). The fans don’t jump into the game, so (A) is out. You can’t make a case for (B) because
the townspeople were involved. After all, they’ve already “cheered him on” (line 29). Line 53
makes it clear that the fans do support Camel’s escape, so choice (C) strikes out. Nor can
you select (E), because no one showed “despair” in the first 42 lines of the poem. Bingo, (D)
wins. The phrase “the fans all sucked air” (in line 40) indicates a collective hush and a
sudden, serious mood.
7. (D). A bird can’t fly on only one wing, so the statement implies a handicap or a lack of bal-
ance. The fans are shocked by Ellic Camel’s run out of the stadium; in other words, they’re
“off-balance,” as (D) states. Choice (A) isn’t supported by the text because the fans only
“sucked air” (line 40); no one actually moves. Line 53 states that the fans were “glad,” so (B)
is out. The escape attempt is futile, so choice (C) is tempting, but line 41 specifically refers
to “the stadium,” which in this line is a stand-in for the crowd. Choice (D) is therefore the
better answer because it mentions the fans. (E) is from some other universe entirely — or at
least from some other poem.
8. (E). The “match dropped in dry woods” quickly starts a fire because the “woods” are ready
to burn. In other words, the fans are ready — but for what? The poem clearly shows that
the fans are on Camel’s side (“We were glad,” line 53). Statements I and III make the cut,
but II is a dud because the “match dropped in dry woods” addresses process, from readi-
ness to full fire, not the feelings themselves.
9. (A). In lines 56–58, Camel goes down wriggling, plucked / in half”; obviously he’s mortally
wounded. The three statements about death place Camel’s death between the death of the
“crowd” and the death of the speaker (“I / died,” lines 59–60). The identification of (A) is
supported by the crowd’s cheers (line 48).
10. (B). Jack’s taking bets (line 50), so (A) is A-OK. The fact that Jack can take bets in the pres-
ence of the guards strongly implies that he isn’t a convict, though perhaps he should be,
depending on the gambling laws of that particular location. However, because the gambling
laws don’t appear in the poem (and because no one arrests Jack), (B) is false (and is there-
fore your answer). Choice (C) comes across in the last line of the poem: Everyone’s dead, at
296
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

least metaphorically, but Jack is jingling his profits. (D) is also true because while the
escape costs Ellic Camel his life, Jack sees a chance to make money. The fans seem to know
and tolerate Jack, and he’s using a coffee can for his business — not exactly Wall Street or
Las Vegas! Therefore, choice (E) also is true.
11. (A). The coins, or change, are confined in a coffee can. Also, Ellic Camel dies in a futile
attempt to change his life. Put these two statements together and they justify statement I.
The crowd bets when Ellic takes off. Yes, some of the people may have bet against Camel,
but the fact that the fans cheer him on shows that the crowd ultimately wants Ellic Camel to
get out, to change his circumstances. All these ideas add up to statement II. The jingling
(line 60) represents the temptation. Because the “change” is “jingled,” and because Camel
dies, III makes the cut. Bingo! That means (A) is your answer.
12. (D). Ellic Camel gets two hits: one with his bat and one with a bullet. These two events anchor
the poem. First, Camel hits the ball and sets the stage for his escape. Then, the guards fire and
“hit” him. Thus, (D) is clearly the best answer. Did I catch you on (A)? “Simplistic” means
“overly simple.” The title is simple, but not simplistic. You can vote (B) off the island because
the poem isn’t really about “country baseball” (even though it is technically set at a country
baseball game). Choice (E) fails for the same reason, and (C) is just way too general.
13. (D). Dust off the brain cells that carry your literary definitions, and you’ll see that “Siren
Isle” (line 8) is an allusion, or a reference to something outside the literary work that brings
all of its meaning into the work. Here Mrs. Archer is alluding to an episode in Homer’s
Odyssey about the Sirens, magical creatures whose singing entices and entraps men (the
ancient version of a pop vocalist whose talent is slightly smaller than the tiny amount of
clothing she wears).
14. (A). The word “master” appears in a sentence implying that Mrs. Archer’s son decided to
humor his mother because she was “perturbed by the premature announcement of his
engagement” (lines 11–13). The key is that the son had the power to make the decision, not
Mrs. Archer.
Question 14 contains a typical AP trick; it includes statements that are true (choice D, for
example) but not relevant to the question, which is asking for the meaning of the word
“master” in the context of this passage. Be sure you know what question you’re answering.
15. (B). Mrs. Archer’s thoughts, such as her idea that “young men are so foolish and incalcula-
ble” (line 5), and the description of her “slight lapses from perfect sweetness” (line 21)
immediately establish a mocking tone. Choice (D) is true in the sense that the passage is
critical of the society depicted, but mockery better captures the author’s gentle humor.
Choices (C) and (E) are too harsh. (A) implies an element of surprise, something unex-
pected. Unless you were raised by wolves, you’ve met someone resembling Mrs. Archer
and Mr. Jackson, so choice (B) is best.
16. (C). The characters in this passage emphasize outward appearances and behavior. Mrs.
Archer and her son never “allude to what was uppermost in their thoughts” (lines 35–36),
so (A) is out. Mrs. Archer “had behaved beautifully” (line 22), clearly part of the social con-
tract as expressed by (B), and she understood the “Mingotts’ esprit de corps” (line 17), a
reference to family loyalty — choice (D). The conversation about clothes, especially Janey’s
and Mrs. Archer’s comments (lines 83–86 and 96–100), shows that in the world described in
this passage, you are what you wear.
17. (E). Mrs. Archer wants the dirt on the Countess, so she sets out to “draw” (line 44) informa-
tion from Mr. Jackson, to encourage him to give her all the gossip available. The other
choices all relate to real meanings of the word “draw.” However, the key here is to look for
the meaning of the word in context.
18. (E). Ellen Olenska isn’t around, so you can rule out choices (A) and (B). He gives no indica-
tion of being obsessed with her, as in choice (C). She’s fair game for the gossip mill, so (D)
and (E) are both possible. (D) is a little extreme, and in fact it’s the women, not Mr. Jackson,
who really eat up Ellen Olenska. The best answer is therefore (E).
297
Chapter 19: Checking In: Scoring Practice Exam 2

19. (A). Fancy paintings of wealthy ancestors, including one with a “white-columned country
house” in the background, shout “old money,” which means that (A) is a good choice. The
Archers are part of this social set, as is Mr. Jackson, so choices (C), (D), and (E) don’t make
the grade. The only choice left is (B). And unless you find stuffy old paintings relaxing and
comforting, that answer also bites the dust.
20. (D). To decode the remarks of Mrs. Archer and Janey, you need to notice a few details. For
instance, Janey speaks with “artless malice” (line 74), a fancy way of saying that her bad
intentions come across as natural or unstudied. Mrs. Archer “moaned” (line 80) because
she couldn’t see a “sense of delicacy” (line 82) as the motivation for the Countess’s walking
with a man. Even the compliments or excuses are little stabs at the Countess. Mrs. Archer’s
“Ah” (line 71) is shorthand for “She had that decency” (line 72), which itself is a stand-in for
“she’s usually indecent.” Because most of the comments are in shorthand, the criticism is
indirect.
21. (D). Ellen Olenska wore a (gasp) black satin dress at her coming-out ball (lines 100–101).
Even if you don’t know the social rules for debutantes (and I don’t either), you can tell that
this clothing was a no-no by the reference to “an eccentric upbringing” (line 98). Mrs. Archer
says, “What can you expect . . .” implying that anyone who doesn’t get the dress code will go
on to bigger mistakes. Therefore, (D) is your best answer. Choices (A), (B), and (E) are tempt-
ing, but the Countess isn’t a total outcast (after all, she was seen walking with Mr. Beaufort in
lines 77–78). And the point isn’t the dress alone, but when and where it was worn. Choice (C)
isn’t supported anywhere in the passage.
22. (B). The rules of this society are quite strict: no black satin at coming-out balls, no walking
with other women’s husbands, and so forth. No one in this passage is in love, so (A) isn’t a
good answer. And while Mr. Archer rebels a bit, his sister isn’t in conflict with the older gen-
eration, represented by her mother. Therefore, (C) is out. Choice (E) is also a loser; the pas-
sage doesn’t challenge gender roles. (D) is tempting because of the characters’ insincerity,
but as they’re fairly open about their disapproval of the countess, (B) is a better choice.
23. (D). The speaker comments on a “glimpse” (line 7) of “youthful forms and youthful faces”
(line 8), but the poem gives no information at all about the speaker’s age. The fact that the
poet contrasts the speaker with the rest of the village may even imply the opposite — that
the speaker is older than the other villagers. Clearly, choice (D) is the answer. The snow
takes care of choice (A). And the fact that the speaker is walking alone and has not even one
person “with whom to talk” (line 2) leads you to dump (B). Line 5, “And I thought I had the
folk within,” implies choice (C), because one meaning of “had” is “understood.” The dark
windows (line 12) and the “slumbering” in line 14 take care of choice (E).
24. (C). Who would have thought that there were so many nuances of “had”? In lines 1 and 5
“had” is personal, much like the way you “have” or “had” a friend. The other instances of
“had” reveal what the speaker heard and saw: the small signs of human life that sustain him
or her. The next “had” sums up these things that the speaker latches onto, despite being
alone: “I had such company” (line 9). Thus, the simple verb shows the relationship between
the speaker and the inhabitants of the village and the homely signs of life. Of the other
choices, the most tempting is probably (B), because the speaker’s solitude implies a wish
for more company. However, the poem is entitled “Good Hours,” so that choice is a bit of a
stretch. The speaker may be one of those people who like to know that others are around
but don’t want to interact.
25. (A). In this poem, you can pair off the lines by rhymes. “Walk” partners with “talk,” “row”
with “snow,” and so on. These pairs are couplets, an easy poetic term to remember because
it sounds like “couples.” Choice (B) is out for the count because a sonnet has 14 lines. Third
person is the point of view of an outsider, talking about someone else (the “he,” “she,” or
“they” point of view), so (C) is wrong. Iambic pentameter, the ten-syllable heartbeat line,
doesn’t fit here, so (D) also bites the dust. The poem does have a turning point, between the
outward and the inbound journey (line 11), but (E) specifies line 13, so you’re left with (A).
298
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

26. (B). The speaker strikes out alone and goes farther and farther until no one else is around,
whereupon the speaker “turned and repented” (line 11). This journey, in a metaphorical
sense, may represent the speaker’s choosing a different path in life from the path of the
other villagers. In other words, he doesn’t conform to an established norm. Thus, (B) wins
out. The other choices aren’t supported in the poem. The reader learns nothing about the
speaker’s dreams. Choice (C) is always a favorite because poets so often write about the
cycle of life, but in this poem you don’t have any cycles. Choices (D) and (E) sound impor-
tant and poetic, but they’re also irrelevant here.
27. (B). “Profanation” (line 15) refers to the desecration of something sacred. The speaker says
that the sound of his or her “creaking feet” (line 13) came across as “profanation.” Choice
(A) wipes out because the speaker does return to town. (C) is wrong because the townspeo-
ple are “slumbering” (line 14), not gone. Because the townspeople are asleep, you can’t tell
whether they’ve chosen to leave the speaker alone. After all, you can’t socialize when you
sleep! Therefore, choice (D) is out. Can anyone leave the town? Who knows? And because
you don’t know, (E) isn’t the correct choice.
28. (C). Hyperbole is exaggeration, and this poem sticks to the facts of a walk through the snow.
As you see, choice (C) is the correct answer. Choice (A) appears in line 1, among other
places, when the consonant “w” repeats (“winter evening walk”), giving you alliteration.
Choice (B), enjambment, is a fancy term for a line that wraps around the line break, continu-
ing the meaning. You can find enjambment in lines 3, 7, 11, 13, and 14. Assonance, the repeti-
tion of vowel sounds, is shown in line 4 with “shining eyes.” Those same eyes, the house
windows, create personification, which is lit-speak for giving nonhuman items human char-
acteristics.
29. (A). The tone of this poem is so detached that you might think the speaker is on a witness
stand, telling the reader the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Granted, a
little emotion leaks in by way of words such as “repented” (line 11), but mostly you get a
sense of uninvolvement, a synonym for “detachment.”
30. (E). The syntax (a fancy term for the way words fit together grammatically) is odd here, but
decipherable. The lighted windows the speaker saw on the way out of town are all dark now.
31. (A). The worm is relatively powerless. True, it may have “squiggled away” like the word in
line 2. However, a worm’s life can be severed in an instant by the sharp beak of a robin. In
the same way, the student is less powerful than the teacher. The student’s eyes watch the
teacher, as prey watches a predator. Nowhere does the speaker show contempt (B), nor
does the student behave in a sneaky way (D). Choices (C) and (E) aren’t correct because
aphasia means the speaker can’t express himself or herself and, as everyone’s cellphone
bills prove, speechlessness isn’t natural.
32. (C). Choice (A) is out because the speaker does want to recall the word but is unable to
do so. (B) is tempting, but it’s less extreme than (C) and nothing in the poem supports the
idea of a permanent break. (D) is flat-out wrong because the speaker isn’t in control. Finally,
choice (E) might draw you in because the speaker’s feelings are implied, not stated. However,
the fact that the teacher describes the aphasia so carefully shows that the speaker does have
feelings about the situation.
33. (E). The first stanza is a simile (the worm is compared to a word), and the second and third
stanzas contain a metaphor (a description created when one thing is equated with another).
Therefore you can eliminate choices (A) and (C). The poem narrates a short incident, with
the speaker standing in front of a student and losing words. So (B) drops out. The eyes are
described in detail, taking care of (D). Personification, choice (E), is the only element left,
and it isn’t present in the poem.
34. (C). The poem describes an incident and also a relationship, one in which two people lose a
connection. In other words, they become detached. As a teacher myself, I’d see that situa-
tion as regretful.
299
Chapter 19: Checking In: Scoring Practice Exam 2

35. (A). The “quiet, empty gallery” (line 7) is a vacuum, waiting for something to fill it. In this
poem, the filler might be what the teacher intended to say. Choice (B) is out because noth-
ing in the poem shows stubbornness. And (C), (D), and (E) aren’t supported anywhere in
the passage.
36. (B). The “saucer-shaped hollow” (lines 2–3) is a compromise, a shorter walk than “to a more
distant ridge” (line 4). Mrs. Jarvis’s walks, therefore, symbolize the compromises she has
made in her life. The passage says nothing about her health or her love of nature — choices
(A) and (E) — so you can rule out those answers. Ditching (C) and (D) is more difficult
because her husband and her wishes are in the passage. For instance, the last two lines do
imply confusion, as does (C). But the statement about the hollow and the ridge doesn’t say
that she can’t decide where she wants to go. She knows; she just doesn’t go there. Choice (D)
is wrong because although line 10 tells you that she doesn’t want to “ruin a good man’s
career,” not killing his job prospects and making his wishes a priority aren’t equivalent.
37. (C). This answer is easy after you invert the unusual word order of the last sentence of the
first paragraph. With this flip-flopping, for example, line 11 states that “she sometimes
threatened” to “leave her husband, and ruin a good man’s career.” “She” has to be Mrs.
Jarvis, the only female in the passage.
38. (A). Did I catch you with this question? The word “kind” is embedded in “kindling,” but the
two are quite different. “Kindling” is the term for small pieces of wood that are used to start
a fire, and fire is a symbol of passion. Mrs. Jarvis doesn’t have “blazing” eyes, so her pas-
sion is still waiting to ignite or, as choice (A) puts it, her passion is “untapped.” None of the
other choices are supported by the passage.
39. (E). Mrs. Jarvis would “lose her faith” (line 16) during her walk if she confused God with the
“universal” (line 17). The only other answer remotely close is (A), but she isn’t swapping;
she muddling the two together.
40. (D). Virginia Woolf, who wrote the novel from which this passage is taken, loved to throw
symbols into her work for you to interpret. Symbols are things or events in the literary work
that represent larger ideas. In this passage, Mrs. Jarvis “read a few lines of poetry” (line 6)
and “never read her poem through” (line 19). She’s “not very unhappy” (line 7) and thinks “if
only . . .” (line 33). All of these lines indicate that she wants more than she has. Throw in the
reference to leaving her husband in lines 9–10 and you’re there: finishing the poem symbol-
izes completing a task, such as leaving her husband, and changing that “if only” to “Yes!”
41. (C). The first paragraph mostly describes what Mrs. Jarvis does and how she feels. It has a
symbol. (See the preceding answer, which explains how Mrs. Jarvis’s poetry reading is sym-
bolic.) However, most of the paragraph is straightforward. The second paragraph moves
into figurative language, in which words or phrases have more than a literal level of mean-
ing. The second paragraph is full of symbols — the “kindling eyes” (line 14), the soaring lark
(line 23), and so forth. Choice (A) doesn’t work because the second paragraph isn’t narra-
tive; in other words, it doesn’t tell a story. You can vote the other choices off the island
because the whole passage is in third person. Not much action happens in the second
paragraph, and the first paragraph isn’t a summary.
42. (D). Mrs. Jarvis doesn’t love her husband. The big sigh in line 33 and the clues at the end of
first paragraph make this fact perfectly clear.
43. (B). Simple decoding snags the correct answer for this question. The “breeze” is a subject
matched with three actions: “blows,” “dies,” and “leaving the cheek kissed” (lines 26–27).
Also, Mr. Jarvis does not sound like the kind of fellow who would trek over a moor just to
kiss his wife. And I don’t even want to think about those sheep smacking their lips!
44. (A). These lines contain many images of freedom, from a soaring lark (line 23) to the move-
ment of sheep “onwards” (lines 23–24) to the “ships on the sea” (line 27). The images
become increasingly more fanciful with the “distant concussions in the air” (lines 29–30)
and the “phantom horsemen” (line 30) until the “horizon” (line 31) is reached. Symbolically,
Mrs. Jarvis can see freedom; she just can’t figure out how to achieve it.
300
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

45. (D). The half sentences of lines 33–34 end with ellipses, a handy punctuation mark indicating
omission. The last sentence of the passage is the clue as to what Mrs. Jarvis is omitting and
why. The only other answer that comes close is (B), because Mrs. Jarvis clearly does have
regrets. However, those regrets aren’t revealed by the ellipses.
46. (C). You hear Mrs. Jarvis’s thoughts (line 33), see her actions (lines 1–4), and learn about
the places that she goes (lines 1–4). She’s described in lines 14 and 15. The only thing miss-
ing is other people. We know what she says to her husband, but we don’t how he or anyone
else reacts to her.
47. (D). The Houyhnhnms are shocked that the narrator can learn a language. Throughout the
first paragraph, the narrator is seen as a “brute animal” (line 5) and a “prodigy” (line 5) who
has “marks of a rational creature” (line 6). Imagine your dog politely asking you to play a
Beethoven sonata, and then you’ll be in the same mood as the Houyhnhnms.
Did you choose (B)? If so, you made a common error. The author isn’t the same as the nar-
rator. The author may certainly choose elements of his or her own life, but the great thing
about fiction is that you have license to lie. In fact, you’re expected to do so. Makes you
wonder why politicians don’t write more novels.
48. (B). The first and third paragraphs describe both the narrator’s efforts to learn the language
and the way the horses react to the narrator. The second paragraph is a comment on the lan-
guage itself; it compares the language to “High Dutch” (line 16). You may have been snagged
by choice (A). True, the chronology is broken by the second paragraph, but that paragraph
isn’t a narrative, so chronology is irrelevant. Thus, you should go with choice (B).
49. (A). Take a look at line 26, in which the narrator’s “teachableness, civility, and cleanliness”
surprise the master, who has been sure that the narrator is a Yahoo. These qualities, fur-
thermore, are “altogether opposite to those animals” (lines 27–28). Choice (B) bombs
because Yahoos aren’t horses. Choices (C), (D), and (E) lose because the passage compares
the narrator to a Yahoo several times, such as in lines 51–56. In these lines, the narrator is
said to share a physical resemblance with a Yahoo but not to behave like one, because the
narrator imitates a rational creature (lines 50–51).
50. (E). The activity described just before “This last” (line 41) is turning “all I learned into the
English alphabet, and writ[ing] the words down, with the translations” (lines 40–41).
Therefore, you need an answer that includes those activities, and (E) wins the prize.
51. (A). The Houyhnhnms have no word for lying; they can only say of the narrator that he
“must needs be mistaken, or that I said the thing which was not” (lines 63–64). The word
Houyhnhnm is derived from “perfection of nature” (lines 73–74). Because they’re shocked
that “there could be country beyond the sea” (line 67), you know that Houyhnhnms stay
put. (You would too if you had to spell that name on a hotel registration slip.) All three
statements are true, so (A) is the answer you want.
52. (C). The passage mentions a master, a foal, a nag, a mare, and a couple of other words for
horses, but no names. Without names, you can assume that individuality isn’t important to
these horses, so (B) drops out. Choice (A) is wrong because the Houyhnhnms are puzzled,
but not threatened, by the narrator. The passage contains numerous comments showing
that Houyhnhnms see themselves as superior to Yahoos but no information about harmony
or conflict, so you can eliminate (D). Line 45 specifically states that Houyhnhnms have “not
the least idea of books or literature.” This statement means they aren’t likely to have a liter-
ate society as (E) suggests. Clearly, (C) is the best choice.
53. (E). The passage is an extended joke, poking fun at human notions of superiority. In this
society, the horses are in charge and the humans — or Yahoos — are irrational, dirty,
stupid, and, well, you get the point. When a text pokes fun at something in this way, it’s con-
sidered a satire. Besides (E), the only other choice remotely possible is (A), because Swift
criticizes human society by showing a better crowd (the horses). Choice (E), however, is
more specific to literature, so it’s the better answer.

54. (D). The narrator tells you what he does, what he says, and how the Houyhnhnms react.
He’s also described in general terms (he looks like a Yahoo), but in this passage, he has no
inner life. Thus, thoughts aren’t in the passage.
55. (B). Humans tend to see themselves as superior to animals, and emperors imagine that
they’re superior to other humans. The idea of Charles V figuring out how to talk to a horse
in a different language should bring a smile to your face. (I know, during an AP test even the
funniest comedy routine falls flat.) Here Swift is mocking the feeling of superiority — of
human beings and of their rulers.
56. (E). Like most satires, Gulliver’s Travels depicts an extreme — in this case, a land of intelligent
horses — in order to show the silliness of human nature. By flipping the usual horse/human
relationship and by showing how the Houyhnhnms feel about Yahoos (human beings), Swift
criticizes the usual “we’re number one” attitude that many people have (except, of course,
those who live with a pet cat). Were you tempted by (B)? That choice is wrong because the
passage isn’t describing real animals. The Houyhnhnms aren’t horses, with equine behavior.
They’re people with fur and hooves.
Multiple-choice conversion formula
To go from your raw multiple-choice score to a converted score, you have to subtract 1⁄4 of
the number of wrong answers from the number of correct answers. This process sounds
complicated, but it really isn’t that bad. Follow these steps to get it right:
1. Multiply the number of answers you got wrong by 1⁄4.
For example, if you got 8 answers wrong, your result for this step would be 2.
2. Subtract the result from Step 1 from the total number of answers you got right.
This answer is your converted multiple-choice score.
Continuing the example from Step 1, if you got 47 answers correct, your converted
multiple-choice score would be 45.
Now that you have the converted multiple-choice score, enter it in the later section “Putting
It all Together: Calculating Your Overall AP Exam Score.”
A Challenge for the Indecisive: 
Scoring the Essays
Scoring essays isn’t much fun. I know, because I regularly take home stacks of papers to
wade through. Okay, I’m lying. I do take home stacks of papers, but I mostly enjoy reading
them, because I get a chance to see how my students’ writing abilities and insights into litera-
ture have developed. Now you get a chance to do the same for your own work. If this is the
second practice exam you’ve graded, you know what to do. If it’s the first, here’s the drill:
1. Read through the instructions on how to score an essay, which I provide in
Chapter 17.
2. Read the sample essays for each question.
I provide two samples per question, and I explain what’s good and bad about each.
3. Reread your own essay.
302
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

4. Go over the general checklist, evaluating your essay and entering a score for each
category.
Each category contains three possibilities (4, 5, 6 or 7, 8, 9, for example). If you can’t
decide between two numbers, ask yourself whether your essay is closer to the next
higher or next lower category. If it misses a higher category by a hair, take the highest
number of the three. If it narrowly escapes the lower category, choose the lowest number
of the three. Can’t decide? Go for the middle.
5. Use the formula at the end of the checklist to convert your score.
Two errors draw a zero for an essay. These two errors include an essay that’s left blank
or an essay that doesn’t answer the question. If one of these situations applies to you,
check out Chapters 7 or 12 for help with essay writing.
Essay 1: Harriet Jacobs and 
the Abolition of Slavery
Harriet Jacobs’s justly famous autobiography communicated the horrors of slavery by
means of her own experience. The passage in the exam prompt clearly conveys her terrible
living conditions while in hiding. After the AP exam is out of your hair, I recommend that you
read the entire, amazing story. But first, score your essay.
Scoring grid for essay 1
Before you fill in the following scoring grid, reread your essay. Underline spots where you
might have done better, and indicate areas in which you excelled. Then work your way
through the categories in this scoring section, assigning yourself a number in each one.
Addresses the question: _____
The prompt requires you to consider three things: the intended audience for Harriet Jacobs’s
writing, her cause (the abolition of slavery), and the literary techniques she employs to win
over her audience. Choose a number from the following list that reflects how well your essay
addresses the question:
0
The essay doesn’t answer the question or is left blank.
1–3
The essay summarizes what Harriet Jacobs went through and mentions one or
two elements of her style. The issue of the intended audience isn’t addressed in
any detail. The essay doesn’t explain how Jacobs’s passage furthers the abolition-
ist cause.
4–6
The essay contains some summary of Jacobs’s experience but makes several
points about literary techniques and their possible effect on the intended audi-
ence. The essay doesn’t explore in depth how the passage furthers the abolition-
ist cause. The essay may stray from the question and include some irrelevant
material.
7–9
The essay identifies the intended audience for this book and explains why that
particular audience would read it. The essay explains the literary techniques used
in this passage and discusses how each may affect the intended audience, linking
those effects to abolition. Few, if any, off-topic and summary statements appear in
the essay.
303
Chapter 19: Checking In: Scoring Practice Exam 2

Literary analysis: _____
The AP English exam evaluates your ability to analyze a literary work and the author’s writ-
ing technique. Scan your essay and then choose the number from this list that best repre-
sents your analysis of Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl:
1–3
The essay simply lists the hardships that Jacobs endured and defines the intended
audience without discussing why or how the definition was made. Little or no analy-
sis of literary techniques is included. No interpretation or analysis links the passage
to the abolitionist cause.
4–6
The essay explains how Jacobs and others lived as slaves, and it also mentions
one or two other literary devices and explains their effect on the reader on a
simple level. An intended audience is identified and briefly explored. Some link is
made between the passage and the abolitionist cause.
7–9
The essay describes the formal diction, syntax, allusion, imagery, and figurative
language of the passage and their effect on the reader. The intended audience is
inferred from the technique and content of the passage. The link between the pas-
sage and the abolitionist cause is clearly made.
Evidence/support: _____
How much evidence have you supplied? Have you made a strong case to persuade the jury
(the exam graders) that your ideas are correct? Evaluate your response by choosing a
number from this list:
1–3
The writer makes only general statements with very few or no specific references
to the passage.
4–6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The refer-
ences may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some quotations may
be overly long, too short, or not supportive of the writer’s point.
7–9
The writer provides strong support for his or her interpretations by choosing spe-
cific and relevant facts from the text. Quotations are excerpted so that the point is
made clearly and concisely.
Writing skills: _____
To grade your writing skills, step back a bit and pretend that you’re reading someone else’s
essay. Does the writing sound smooth? Can you detect a logical path from start to finish?
Evaluate your work and assign a number from one of these categories:
1–3
The essay is disorganized or filled with distracting grammar and spelling errors.
Transitions between one point and another are awkward or missing entirely.
4–6
The essay has a logical structure. The writer’s thesis (main idea) and supporting
points are easily defined. The writing doesn’t always flow smoothly, or it may con-
tain repetitive or wordy statements. Quotations are inserted awkwardly.
7–9
The essay demonstrates clear, fluid style with a good command of language. The
essay moves from a clear thesis through supporting points, each accompanied by
evidence, to a logical conclusion.

Sample answer 1
Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl is an account of her “escape” from
slavery. Jacobs hid in an attic for seven years under terrible conditions, yet she still believed
that anything was better than being owned by another human being. Jacobs was probably
writing for an audience that was already opposed to slavery because it is not likely that pro-
slavery people would buy her book. Her audience was probably white and free, perhaps
living in the North or in other countries. Jacobs wants her readers to work for the abolition
of slavery and her book was probably meant to inspire readers to take action.
Right from the start Jacobs shows the bad conditions she lived in after her escape. First
she was in a swamp and then in a “very small garret” (line 2) where she can’t stand up straight
or even roll over without hitting her head. She says that “the air was stifling; the darkness
total” (line 9). She couldn’t exercise, and until she bored a hole in the wall, she couldn’t see
her children. She was bitten by insects and burned by “the scorching summer’s sun” (line 51).
In spite of all these hardships, she finds it better than to be a slave.
Jacobs also talks about what other slaves went through, even worse than her own situa-
tion. In lines 20–24, she says that she wasn’t overworked, wasn’t whipped or cut or tortured
by a branding iron or bit by dogs. Even though these things didn’t happen to her, Jacobs still
says that God should “pity the woman who is compelled to lead such a life” (lines 26–27) as
hers. Jacobs goes on to explain how her “owner” Dr. Flint searched for her. He questioned
her children, so she couldn’t tell them where she was, couldn’t speak to them or have any-
thing to do with them except see them through the hole in the wall. She puts up with this
because slavery is so awful.
Jacobs’s literary techniques include quoting dialogue from Dr. Flint and her children and
detailed description of her living conditions. The sadness of her children’s comments would
make anyone work to end slavery. She writes in very formal diction with good grammar to
show that former slaves are capable of being educated. She makes an allusion to Robinson
Crusoe, a fictional character who lived mostly alone on a desert island, to show the loneli-
ness she had to suffer, again attempting to inspire action. What could be the excuse for not
working against slavery, compared to Harriet Jacobs’s sacrifices and sufferings?

Chapter 19: Checking In: Scoring Practice Exam 2

Addresses the question: 8
The writer addresses all the key elements of the question: the intended audience, the literary
techniques used, and the furthering of the cause of abolition. The essay stays on topic.
Literary analysis: 6
Most, but not all of the literary techniques are included. The writer doesn’t mention imagery
(the sensory details in the first and second paragraphs of the passage) or figurative language
(the “tempest” in line 12). The writer’s fourth paragraph lists the literary techniques without
much sophisticated analysis. The writer says that the audience is probably “white and free”
but doesn’t explore that concept except to say that pro-slavery people wouldn’t buy the book.
Evidence/support: 6
The writer includes some general statements about the audience without using some of
the supportive evidence available, such as the reference to “white people” in line 19 of the
passage. The essay includes a fair amount of detail about living conditions and some good
quotations to show that slavery imposed a terrible burden on slaves. Formal diction is men-
tioned, but no examples are supplied.
Writing skills: 7
This sample doesn’t have too many grammar errors, and the spelling is great. Some of the
quotations don’t have line numbers in parentheses, but otherwise, the writing is technically
sound and the quotations are inserted smoothly. The vocabulary and style are adequate,
though not sophisticated, and the command of language is only fair. The essay comes to an
abrupt conclusion. To the writer’s credit, however, the last paragraph actually is a conclu-
sion, not a summary.
Overall score: 7
Here’s how you calculate the converted score for sample 1:
8 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 29
29÷4 = 7.25 (which rounds down to 7)
Sample answer 2
Harriet Jacobs lived a terrible life as a slave. She had to hide in an attic, like Anne Frank
did during World War II, and she was not allowed to speak to anyone or see anyone for many
years. In this essay I will prove that Harriet was writing to people who thought slavery was
good. She wanted to change their minds.
Harriet tells all about the barn and its attic. It was hot and there were bugs. Her chidren
were outside, but she could see them sometimes. She could also see her owner and that
made her scared. She did not try to run away more, she stayed near her children. The list of
things she put up with is a good technique to convince people that slavery is wrong. She also
tells about other things that slaves put up with, like branding and cuting their legs. She
writes about Benny to show that he can’t stand up to a white man, the white man doesn’t
own Benny but it is still dangerous.

Oh my, sample essay 2 needs help! Even before you read it, you notice that the writer hasn’t
made much of a case. There simply isn’t enough text! After you read the essay, you see
what’s missing. Check out the following scores.
Addresses the question: 3
The writer addresses some parts of the question, including the intended audience, and indi-
rectly refers to furthering the cause of abolition (in the first paragraph, where he or she
writes “She wanted to change their minds.”). The essay doesn’t deal with literary techniques
except for a quick list of details of the attic. Even though the writer lists the details, that
technique — imagery — isn’t named.
Literary analysis: 2
The essay includes no real interpretation of Jacobs’s techniques or their effect on the reader.
Evidence/support: 2
Some of the information or interpretation is just plain wrong in this essay. For example,
Harriet Jacobs (who shouldn’t be called “Harriet” in a literary essay) did speak to the adults
who were helping her, and she did see her children and others through the holes that she
bored in the wall. Other details are correct but sparse. And quotations aren’t anywhere to
be found.
Writing skills: 2
This writer won’t win any prizes, but the grammar and spelling errors (for example, “cuting”
instead of “cutting” and “chidren” instead of “children”) don’t rise to a level that impedes the
reader. Therefore, these mistakes aren’t counted heavily against the writer’s score. However,
the essay has no real structure and no logical flow from introduction to conclusion. The
vocabulary is elementary, and some of the statements (such as, “In this essay I will prove . . .”)
are the equivalent of scratching a fingernail on the chalkboard for an AP exam grader.
Overall score: 2
Here’s how you calculate the converted score for sample 2:
3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 9
9÷4 = 2.25 (which rounds down to 2)
Essay 2: John Allman on Ways of Life
John Allman’s poem, “Spraying the Chickens,” is from Attractions (2River Press, 2006). It is a
prose poem, a hybrid that has the form of a paragraph but the poetic devices that you expect
to find in a poem that has a more conventional appearance. The beauty of Allman’s poem is

Scoring grid for essay 2
This section explains how to score your essay on “Spraying the Chickens.”
Addresses the question: _____
The prompt asks you to determine the poet’s attitude toward two ways of life implied in the
poem. You also have to explain the poetic elements that Allman employs to convey his atti-
tude. Score your essay according to the following criteria:
0
The essay doesn’t answer the question or is left blank.
1–3
The essay doesn’t clearly state the two ways of living or the poet’s attitude
toward these lifestyles. Little mention is made of poetic technique, and only a
weak link is made between technique and meaning.
4–6
The essay contains a simple statement about the two ways of living and the poet’s
attitude toward them. The essay may stray from the question and may include
some irrelevant material. Some explanation of the poetic techniques is included,
and these techniques are linked at least in part to the meaning of the poem.
7–9
The essay clearly explains the two ways of living discussed in the poem. It also
fully explains the literary techniques that are used in this poem and discusses
how each reveals more about the poet’s view. Few, if any, off-topic and summary
statements appear in the essay.
Literary analysis: _____
How well have you understood the levels of meaning in this poem? The following scoring
categories help you decide which number is appropriate for your essay:
1–3
The essay decodes the meaning of the poem incorrectly or simplistically, con-
trasting earlier times, when human beings were more closely connected to nature,
with the modern era, when sterile practices mandate that chickens must be
sprayed. Literary techniques are merely listed, and no interpretation or analysis
relates these techniques to the poet’s attitude.
4–6
The essay delves into the implications of the practices of the earlier era, mention-
ing death and linking the preparation of the chicken and potatoes to human
mortality. The essay mentions several literary techniques and explores one or
two deeply. Some link is made between literary technique and the poet’s view.
7–9
The essay explores the meaning of the poem in depth, considering the lack of per-
fection implied by the “dark spot near the pimply shoulder” (line 4). The theme of
human mortality is discussed at length. The poet’s view is presented with some
complexity, and the link between literary technique and attitude is clearly made.
Evidence/support: _____
Though the poem is short, it’s packed with possible evidence for your case — establishing the
poet’s attitude toward two ways of life. Evaluate your essay with help from these standards:
1–3
The writer makes only general statements with very few or no specific references
to the poem.
4–6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The refer-
ences may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some quotations may
be overly long, too short, or not supportive of the writer’s point.

Sample answer 1
“Spraying the Chickens” is a poem by John Allman. In the poem it talks about a farm, and
the hen and her chicks. The hen is a good mother but she dies anyway. People eat her. The
hen is not perfect and she can’t protect her chicks. They “tremble” in sleep, showing that
somehow they know that they are in danger. They also taste “their own blood” which shows
that death is coming in spite of the hen’s efforts. The farmer’s wife doesn’t care about the
chicken. It says that the chicken is a “naked thing” not a real animal. The chickens represent
the older time. They are not perfect. Some have a “pimply shoulder,” which symbolizes a
fault. The potatoes are dirty. The person the poem talks to, the “you,” is very hungry and
accepts the imperfect meal anyway.
The modern world is different. Chickens are sprayed, so they are more sanitary. The
“proof” in the last line means that we now have ways of being safe and of showing when
something is wrong. In the old days there was “corruption of bodies.” The modern world
has better hygiene, but the chicken feels “the cold touch of strangers.” The cold touch is a
symbol of the disconnection of modern life. So the modern world isn’t much better than the
older one.
Overall the poet likes the old world better. He probably grew up on a farm and liked
having fresh food, even though it wasn’t always clean. The last part of a poem sticks with
the reader, and this poem ends with the “cold touch of strangers.” So the poet rejects the
modern world with this line.

This is a middling essay. It won’t win any prizes, but it isn’t completely terrible either. Check
out the evaluation in this section to see where it falls short.
Addresses the question: 4
This essay does address the question; the writer attempts to define the two ways of living and
mentions one or two poetic techniques, though not always accurately. The writer also tries to
link the techniques to the poet’s attitude. The essay includes some irrelevant statements
about the hunger of the speaker and an incorrect statement about the writer’s childhood.
Literary analysis: 4
This writer gets some things right and some things wrong. The older way of life does have
imperfections, but those imperfections are seen as positive because they, in the form of the
hands of the farmer’s wife, “kept layer upon layer of so much world intact.” This writer recog-
nizes that the poet sees the closeness of nature in its reality as “proof” or evidence (and
therefore forewarning) of death to come. The warmer, older world is contrasted with the
coldness and alienation of the modern world. The writer also mentions some literary devices
and ties some (but not all) of them to meaning.
Evidence/support: 5
The writer includes quite a few quotations from the poem to back up his or her ideas. These
quotations aren’t always the best choices, but there are a fair number of them.

Sample answer 2
John Allman’s “Spraying the Chickens” compares the modern, clean world in which
mankind is alienated from nature to another era, which allowed people to be closer to nature
and therefore closer to reality. Allman’s choice of words, the images he presents, and the
symbolism of the “cold touch of stranger” add up to a clear choice. He prefers the earlier
time when “so much world [was] intact.” The poem also talks about death, a part of reality
we cannot escape even now, despite the fact that we are always “spraying the chickens”
against disease.
The first part of the poem talks about “back then” when things were simple. The world
is dirty — “fecal droppings” and “a dark spot near a pimply shoulder” show that. But some
things were better. The hen gives “just the right kind of mother love.” Surprisingly, the right
kind includes “a touch of illness” and “a taste of their own blood.” The hen’s sons and daugh-
ters are eating mortality, a sign that they will die. The farmer’s wife “wiped the dirt off pota-
toes” but not completely, because “something of that got into your mouth” sometimes, or at
least possibly.
310
Part V: Dress Rehearsal: Practice Exams 

The last part of the poem talks about death more directly. The dirt on the potatoes is a
symbol of the dirt that we will all be buried in. The last two sentences talk about “the corrup-
tion of bodies” and the “cold touch of strangers.” When we die, we will be buried and we will
decay. The strangers may be the funeral workers who prepare the body for burial and in a way
hide reality from us; we don’t have to deal with death face to face. The farmer, on the other
hand, raises, kills, and eats animals. Death is a fact of life, and even though it is unpleasant,
it is better than pretending that death doesn’t exist. No matter what we do now — spraying
chickens to kill germs and hiding their deaths from our sight — we die. To know that fact is
to face reality, which the poet prefers.
Apart from the symbols the poet uses, his word choice also helps get the message across.
Most of the language is very simple. Many words have only one syllable, and all are very
direct. Even if you don’t know anything about farming, you can understand the simple life
Allman describes. Some of the sentences are fragments, not complete sentences. This kind of
writing implies that we don’t really ever understand death completely, only parts of it.
Analysis of sample answer 2
Okay, my English-teacher heart is singing! Here I see a good essay by a student who under-
stands the literature and writes with some skill. I go into the specifics in the following sec-
tions.
Addresses the question: 8
This essay addresses the question; it defines the way of living “back then” and today. The
writer mentions a couple of poetic techniques, and explores others without specifying the
name of the literary device. The writer links techniques to the poet’s attitude fairly well.
Literary analysis: 7
The writer does a reasonably good job of exploring the underlying meaning of the poem, dis-
cussing, for example, the idea of death and human mortality as well as the comparison
between the older and more modern ways of life. The writer makes some fine points about
literary technique, including the simple language and sentence fragments. These techniques
are also linked to the poet’s attitude.
Evidence/support: 8
The writer includes quite a few quotations from the poem to back up his or her ideas. These
quotations are well chosen.
Writing skills: 7
This writer has a fairly strong command of language, and his or her essay is well structured.
The quotations are inserted neatly into the text, and the introduction gets right down to busi-

Finally you get some choice in the matter. (However, you may have too much choice! Take
care not to sit around for an hour deciding between Hamlet and Antigone, for example.) This
section takes you through the third, open-ended essay.
Scoring grid for essay 3
I can’t give you an exact scoring grid for the open-ended essay because I don’t know what
work you’ve chosen to write about. However, I do provide guidelines and two graded essays
with explanations. Read the guidelines, check out the samples, and then digest the explana-
tions before you fill in the scoring checklist for your own work.
Each category on the checklist has three sets of numbers, with the exception of the
“addresses the question” category, which has four because that’s the only category in which
you can score a zero. If you leave this essay blank, if you haven’t chosen a work of literary
quality, or if you don’t answer the question, give yourself zero points. (Chapter 14 helps you
out if you aren’t sure what fits the definition of “literary quality” or if you need general help
with the open-ended question.) The formula at the end of the checklist converts your score.
Addresses the question: _____
This prompt mentions a “betrayal of trust” that adds to your understanding of character,
plot, or theme. In other words, you have to figure out a time when someone betrayed some-
one else and then place that betrayal in the context of one of the three literary elements
cited in the prompt. Score your essay using the following list:
0
The essay doesn’t answer the question or is left blank. The subject of the essay
isn’t a work of literary quality.
1–3
The essay merely summarizes the plot or makes only one or two points about
betrayal of trust. The essay barely touches on the relationship between the
betrayal and the reader’s understanding of character, plot, or theme.
4–6
The essay contains some unnecessary plot summary, but it makes several points
that relate to the relationship between the betrayal and the reader’s understand-
ing of character, plot, or theme. The essay may occasionally stray from the topic.
7–9
The essay focuses on the relationship between betrayal and the reader’s under-
standing of character, plot, or theme. The essay avoids unnecessary plot summary
and off-topic statements.
Literary analysis: _____
The prompt tells you that plot summary isn’t enough. You have to dig into the story and ana-
lyze it. Score your essay according to the criteria listed here:
1–3
The essay stays solely on the literal level, with no interpretation of the betrayal or
of one of the three elements (plot, character, and theme) cited in the question.
One or more statements about the characters may be wrong.
4–6
The essay offers an interpretation of the betrayal but doesn’t go into depth. The
analysis of the betrayal in terms of plot, character, or theme is explained in simple
terms.
7–9
The essay digs into the text, unearthing and exploring the interplay between one
of the literary elements and the act of betrayal.

Evidence/support: _____
No matter which work you choose, you can’t create a good essay without citing specific
events that support the case that you’re trying to make. Rate your essay according to these
standards:
1–3
The writer makes only general statements with no or very few specific references
to the text.
4–6
The writer’s interpretation is supported by some references to the text. The refer-
ences may not be the best or most sophisticated choices. Some references may
not support the writer’s point.
7–9
The writer provides strong support for his or her interpretations by choosing spe-
cific and relevant evidence from the text.
You don’t have a passage to work from for this essay, but you can still be specific. Don’t say,
for example, that Hamlet argues with his mother. Instead, say that Hamlet is furious with his
mother for remarrying so soon after her husband’s death and that he wants his mother to
refrain from sleeping with Claudius. Directly quote only if you’re sure that you know the
exact words.

Sample answer 1
Macbeth, the tragic hero of vaulting ambitions, slowly ascends to the throne of Scotland
through a series of world-class treacheries. A master of manipulation accompanied by the
equally-proficient and deceptive Lady Macbeth, Macbeth betrays those who most desper-
ately seek allegiance, specifically King Duncan.
313
Chapter 19: Checking In: Scoring Practice Exam 2

King Duncan is deeply disturbed by the betrayal of the Thane of Cawdor. Duncan suffers
from the new-found knowledge that those one trusts most can become traitors. In some
sense, Duncan places all his hopes in Macbeth, the military hero who will now become
Thane. Duncan may believe that Macbeth can reclaim his lost confidence in allies and
friends. And in an almost comical tragic twist, Duncan has made one of the worst character
assessments in literary history. Macbeth will have his face “hide what the false heart doth
know” and lure the king into a trap, at which point Macbeth transcends mere ambition and
becomes an executioner. This betrayal, made possible by Duncan’s thirst for loyalty, con-
tributes to the tragic vision of the play: that those he trusts as friends can be the basest of
all enemies.
But Macbeth is far from a two-dimensional character. It seems unlikely that his ambitions
would be made manifest without the diabolical support of Lady Macbeth. Lady Macbeth suf-
fers from frustration, frustration that her husband cannot climb higher on the social ladder.
She pressures and nurtures Macbeth’s dark desires and teaches him the art of deceitfulness.
Also, she gives Macbeth really bad advice, since he should have been satisfied with Thane.
Thus she betrays him as well.
Macbeth betrays Duncan’s thirst for loyalty, and is betrayed by his wife’s manipulation.
Macbeth’s actions lead King Duncan to the afterlife and Lady Macbeth into madness.
Analysis of sample answer 1
This writer wins a prize — not the gold stars they give out in kindergarten, but a fairly high
score on the AP open-ended essay. Read on for specifics about the strengths and weaknesses
of this essay.
Addresses the question: 8
This essay addresses the question; it stays on topic and shows how the Thane of Cawdor’s
betrayal defines Duncan’s character because Duncan needs to prove that he can have at
least some faith in humanity. This point leads directly to Duncan’s death at the hands of
Macbeth. The information about Lady Macbeth also helps to define Macbeth’s character.
Literary analysis: 7
The writer of this essay proves that he or she understands Macbeth well. His or her observa-
tions about Duncan and Macbeth are good. The writer understands that Duncan needs loyalty
from his subjects and that Macbeth’s ambition ultimately trumps loyalty.
Evidence/support: 6
Here’s the place for the most improvement in this essay. The writer is correct in his or her
interpretation of the play but doesn’t really provide evidence for the idea that Duncan needs
to have faith and thus deems Macbeth trustworthy. A few more specifics on both Duncan and
Lady Macbeth would have been helpful.
Writing skills: 8
This writer has a strong command of language. The essay gets to the point, moves smoothly
from one idea to another, and comes to a logical conclusion.

Sample answer 2
Antigone by Sophocles is a play in which betrayal plays an important part. Because
Creon betrays the trust of the city of Thebes, the plot moves forward. Without Creon’s
betrayal, which is to choose his own law over the ancient rules set by the gods about burial,
there would be no story because Antigone would have no reason to rebel. She would marry
Haemon, Creon’s son, and live happily ever after, or at least as happy as Oedipus’s children
can be.
The story begins when Antigone’s brothers fight over who should rule Thebes. One hires
foreign soldiers to attack his brother’s army, which is all Thebans. In the fight the brothers
die. Creon becomes the only ruler of Thebes and says that the traitorous brother, the one
who betrayed Thebes, may not be buried. The body is supposed to be left out in the open
where animals can eat it. Antigone buries her brother’s body and is killed by Creon because
of it. Antigone goes to her death willingly because she thinks that the rules the gods made
are more important than the ones that Creon made. Also, Antigone feels that she has to do
this because it is her brother.
Creon’s duty is to the city. The citizens of Thebes need someone to rule them, and Creon
has their trust. He doesn’t deserve that trust because he makes a bad decision. You could
say that no one is perfect in decisions, but Creon keeps going, even after the blind prophet
Tiresias and the citizens, who are in the chorus, and his own son tell him that he is wrong.
To be stubborn and to put yourself above the laws of the gods is betrayal of the city’s trust.
In the end Creon realizes that he is wrong. He tries to undo his actions, ordering the
burial of the traitorous brother and running to save Antigone from death. But it is too late.
The betrayal is permanent. Antigone is dead, his son is dead, his wife is dead (she commits
suicide), and Creon is left alone.
Analysis of sample answer 2
This essay isn’t exactly in critical condition, but it’s definitely in the literary intensive care
unit. A few aspects of the essay are fair, but there’s plenty of room for improvement. Take a
look at the details in each category.
Addresses the question: 4
The essay addresses parts of the question, but the writer makes a fairly common mistake:
He or she spends far too much time retelling the events of Sophocles’ play. The writer does
mention that the betrayal of the city’s trust — an interesting and justifiable idea — drives the
plot. However, the writer never discusses how the betrayal adds to the reader’s understand-
ing of plot, character, or theme.
Literary analysis: 3
The writer identifies Creon’s betrayal of the citizens’ trust. After that idea, however, the
writer has only one other valuable thing to say: that Creon’s stubborn refusal to listen to
others’ advice adds to the betrayal. These two points could certainly form the basis of a
sophisticated literary analysis, but the writer doesn’t develop them. The only other point
the writer makes is the far-too-simple statement that “the plot moves forward” because of
Creon’s betrayal.
Evidence/support: 3
The writer includes a fair number of details about the plot. However, he or she doesn’t do
much with the details. In other words, the details don’t serve as evidence for the essay’s
thesis — that Creon has betrayed the public’s trust.

The AP exam is weighted: 45 percent of your score comes from the multiple-choice questions
and 55 percent from the three essays. The AP statistics experts take the overall scores from
each section and fiddle with them a bit more until they come up with five categories, which
are called (drum roll, please!) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Plug your numbers into the following formulas,
and then add up the right-hand column to see how you rate:
Multiple-choice overall score _____ × 1.25 = _____

Chapter 20
Ten Mistakes That Kill 
Your Essay Score
In This Chapter
 Identifying common mistakes
 Avoiding unnecessary errors
O
kay, maybe “kill” is too strong a word. English teachers are decent people. (I make this
claim without any bias whatsoever, despite the fact that I’m an English teacher.) In
fact, if the graders can find a way to give your essay an extra point, they most certainly will.
But they’ll also knock off points if you make mistakes. This chapter describes ten ways that
you can mess up, big time, when you write an AP essay. I show you these common mistakes
so you can avoid them like the plagues that they are.
Not Answering the Question
Think of AP essay questions as armed robbers on a deserted street in the middle of the night.
In the interests of self-defense, give them whatever they want. Don’t argue, don’t reconfigure
the prompt, and don’t write whatever pops into your head. Just answer the question, the
whole question, and nothing but the question.
Sounds simple and obvious, right? But in the heat of battle, when you’re watching the clock
with one eye and reading a literary selection with the other, it’s fairly easy to lose sight of 
the basics — a category that includes decoding the prompt. (For detailed instructions on
prompt-decoding, turn to Chapter 3.)
Furthermore, lots of AP test takers tend to respond to part of the prompt, but not to all of it.
For example, suppose the prompt asks you to consider the conflict between two characters
and their responses to the conflict. You have to do three things:
 Define the conflict
 Explain how character A responds
 Explain how character B responds
Two out of three isn’t acceptable, though you will receive some points for your efforts.
One more pitfall: the clock. The AP English Literature and Composition exam allots two
hours for three essays. You can’t spend one hour on the first essay and another hour on the
second, because then you hit the third essay with . . . oops, no time left at all (meaning, obvi-
ously, that you won’t answer the question and will receive a zero on the essay).

Summarizing the Plot or Meaning
The mistake of summarizing the plot or meaning of a work shows up most frequently when
the literary passage is especially difficult to comprehend, perhaps because the language or
syntax is old or obscure. I think I know why test takers limit themselves to plot summary or,
in the case of a poem, to restatement of meaning. After cracking a tough selection, the feeling
of triumph — “I got it! I know what it says!” — takes over. In the first flash of relief, the essay
writer records what he or she understood. It seems like enough, given how difficult it was to
figure the thing out. But summarizing the plot or meaning generally isn’t a great idea. Yes, the
graders want to see that you comprehend the excerpt or poem, but you display that compre-
hension by using plot or meaning to make a point. Remember, the graders want to know
whether you can analyze a text and select relevant sections to support a thesis.
I should mention that in one particular case, a small amount of plot summary is a good idea
(say, three or four sentences). If you’re writing about a lesser-known literary work for the
open-ended essay, you probably should take a moment to orient the grader by reviewing the
basic events of the work that you’re discussing. (Turn to Chapter 14 for more information on
the open-ended essay.)
Writing about Yourself
Consider this sample excerpt from an AP essay:
When I first read T. S. Eliot’s poem “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” I started to cry.
I remember having trouble making friends when I moved from Chicago to Albany, and
the speaker’s immense loneliness echoed what I felt on prom night, when everyone but
me had a date, a limousine, and great clothes, not to mention the pictures for the senior
album, while I was wandering around like a pair of “ragged claws.”
What’s wrong with this excerpt? As my students say when I’m blathering, “Too much infor-
mation!” And this is besides the fact that the necessary info isn’t present. I’m glad to see that
someone relates to Eliot’s masterpiece (though just for the record, he wasn’t writing about
prom night). One of the major benefits of great literature is its ability to hook into our souls
and express otherwise incoherent emotions and thoughts. But the above excerpt belongs in
a diary, not in the pink AP answer-booklet. The message is simple: Stay out of the essay. The
literature is the star, not you.
The sample essay excerpt is exaggerated to make a point, but injecting even a little of your-
self into a literary essay can be a problem. Avoid “in my opinion,” “I think,” and other similar
expressions. You don’t need them because the information they convey is obvious. Of course
you think that Hamlet is too emotional, otherwise why would you say it?
Another common mistake is to write about your experience when your were reading the
work, saying something like “At first I was on Sethe’s side, but as Beloved became more and
more monstrous, I began to sympathize with Denver and to oppose Sethe’s intense relation-
ship with Beloved. Then I realized that. . . .” Unless the prompt asks for your reactions (and
once, years ago, one unusual prompt did just that), keep them to yourself.
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Writing about the Author’s Life
When I introduce a book or a poem to my class, I always waste a couple of minutes on liter-
ary gossip. I give a capsule biography of the author, including the juicy scandals that would
rate a story in the tabloids if the subject were a movie star instead of a 19th-century writer.
Why? I guess because I’m a sucker for that kind of information — even though I read only
quality literature. Honest. Okay, an occasional mystery and some sci-fi make it to my book-
shelf too. And sometimes a trashy magazine. But that’s it.
Those minutes of lit-gossip come back to haunt me when I give a test. Invariably, someone in
my class “analyzes” the literary work by connecting it to the life story of the author, writing
something like “Because Dylan Thomas was an alcoholic, he missed the innocent days of his
childhood, as seen in his poem ‘Fern Hill.’” Uh-oh. That essay’s in trouble! Yes, Dylan Thomas
drank too much, and yes, the poem is about the end of childhood innocence, among other
things. However, Dylan Thomas’s adult life isn’t in the poem. Neither is his bar bill. An essay
about “Fern Hill” should be about “Fern Hill,” and not about the poet’s substance abuse
problem.
Here’s the bottom line: If you happen to know something about the author of the literary
selection you’re writing about, don’t put that information in the essay.
Writing about the Time Period
I often read essay paragraphs resembling this excerpt:
Ophelia obeys her father, Polonius, because in this time and place (Denmark, in ancient
times), women couldn’t control their own destinies. Unlike a modern Ophelia, who can
move out of the palace and get a job if her father and brother reject her, Ophelia is
bound to do whatever the men in her family want her to do.
Even though I enjoy learning about history, that subject shouldn’t intrude on your AP English
essay for the following very good reasons:
 The essay is supposed to discuss the literary work, not the social or historical context.
Unless the prompt specifically asks you to relate the selection to something in reality,
stay inside the imaginary world the author created.
 Without an opportunity to do some research, most test takers don’t know enough his-
tory to write a good essay about a particular era. In the sample essay excerpt, for
instance, notice the phrase “in ancient times.” The writer is wrong!
 It’s easy to confuse two time periods — when the literary work was written and when
the story takes place.
Getting Sloppy with Grammar and Spelling
By the time you sit down in front of an AP test booklet, you’ve suffered through more than a
decade of instruction in grammar and spelling. You’ve learned how to distinguish between
who and whom, you’ve discovered when apostrophes are called for, and you know why
double negatives are no-nos. (Sorry about the lame joke. I couldn’t resist the pun.)
321
Chapter 20: Ten Mistakes That Kill Your Essay Score

While all this education was taking place, however, you maintained your fluency in casual,
conversational English. You never asked your friends, “Would you care to see the new James
Bond movie?” Of course not! You said, “Wanna catch the 10 p.m. Bond?” Or you may have
sent an instant message: “Bond 10PM C U L8R?”
Fine. I advocate bilingualism because I think that formal, grammatically perfect English is too
stilted for friend-to-friend chats. However, the reverse is also true: Friend-to-friend-style com-
ments are completely out of place in a literary essay. You must use formal writing rather than
informal, conversational prose. After all, the AP English Literature and Composition exam
tests your ability to write correctly. So ditch slang and abbreviations — including & (and),
b/c (because), and s/b (should be). Polish up your sentences, and write it right.
You may be the next Superstar Comedian and everyone’s favorite class clown. Good for you.
However, assume that the graders have no sense of humor whatsoever. (They do, but they
lock it in the closet for the duration of the grading period.) Silly jokes detract from your
essay and lower your score.
If grammar drives you nuts, you may want to consult English Grammar For Dummies (Wiley,
2001) or practice in the English Grammar Workbook For Dummies (Wiley, 2006). I wrote both
of them, and I’d love to see my royalties increase.
Especially when answering the third, open-ended essay (see Chapter 14 for more informa-
tion), take care to spell the characters’ names correctly. If you prepare plot and character
summaries in advance, give yourself a short spelling test before test day. Reading an essay
about McBath or Mac Bethe or (my personal favorite) Shakespeare Williams puts graders in
a very bad mood. And if you put your grader in a bad mood, say goodbye to a high score.
Forgetting to Support Your Claims
When I’m grading homework papers, my teeth grind loudly when I see a paragraph like
this one:
Guy, the father in Edwidge Danticat’s short story “A Wall of Fire Rising,” is desperate. He
feels that he has no future, and he sees no upward mobility for his son. He is tied to his
family by the love he feels for them, but that love isn’t enough for him. Guy goes up in
the balloon because all his dreams have died already, and his own death is almost an
afterthought.
Nicely written paragraph, don’t you think? Everything in it is correct (according to my inter-
pretation of Danticat’s story). The sentences are complete, and the spelling and grammar are
impeccable. So why am I making more work for my dentist? Because (drum roll, please!) the
writer has included no supporting evidence!
Here are some points the essay writer could have made:
 Guy’s desperation is revealed by his suicide, which occurs when he jumps out of a hot-
air balloon. Guy steals the balloon, symbolically attempting to escape his own life, but
dies when he realizes that no escape is possible.
 Guy tells his wife that he has secured work cleaning lavatories at the factory. However,
he is still far down on the list for a permanent job. His comments about this situation
show that he sees no potential for a better life.
 Guy and his wife discuss their son’s future. Guy wants to put his son on a waiting list
for a factory job, but his wife opposes the plan. She thinks that her son may achieve
more; Guy does not. This conversation supports the assertion that Guy “sees no
upward mobility for his son.”
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

I could go on, listing more events from the story, but you get the point. The sample excerpt
asks the reader to accept all its assertions on faith. But in an AP English essay, faith isn’t
what you need. Evidence and analysis are essential.
Leaving Out Specifics
Take a look at this lovely excerpt:
Great poets write about issues that matter to everyone. Ted Hughes is no exception. In
his poem “The Thought-Fox,” Hughes considers many important themes and ideas. His
topic is creativity, an issue of importance to poets and non-poets alike. In this poem
Hughes discusses how creativity occurs. He tells a story about creativity, illustrating the
process. Because creativity varies from person to person and artistic accomplishment is
difficult, the reader understands more about how a poem is written after reading “The
Thought-Fox.”
Excuse me while I gag. The writer of the preceding clunker has managed to place 82 words
on the page and explain absolutely nothing about Hughes’ poem — except for the fact that
he wrote it and that it has a story in it. With that information, Hughes and his work remain a
mystery.
The writer’s problem here is generality. So Hughes “considers many important themes
and ideas.” Great. Which ones? And which writer doesn’t consider important themes and
ideas? Rather, which writer suitable for the AP doesn’t? (See why general statements are
problematic?)
The alternative to a general essay, as you have already guessed, is an essay filled with
specifics. Quotations, of course, are always great. But even without quoting, you can go into
detail, as in this sample excerpt:
Hughes’ poem imagines a writer in the calm of midnight. The writer in the poem, in turn,
imagines a fox. First to be described is the fox’s dark nose, which contrasts with the
snow. Next the animal’s eyes appear; they flicker back and forth, checking the surround-
ings. The footprints, closely followed by legs and a body, arrive in stanza four. By the
sixth and last stanza the poet can smell the fox, which has become real to both the
reader and to the poet-in-the-poem. The poem has also become real, as the poet finishes
his job of imagining a “thought-fox” and prints out the page on which he has described
the animal.
Repeating Yourself
Forty minutes doesn’t give you much time to write an essay because you have only forty
minutes, which means you’re pressed for time, given the fact that you have less than an hour
and that’s not enough time to write everything you can think of.
Snoring yet? I am. The preceding paragraph says everything, and then says everything, and
then says everything again. I got the point the first time, and I’m sure you did too. When you
repeat yourself, you
 Waste precious time
 Make the graders feel that your essay is a waste of time
323
Chapter 20: Ten Mistakes That Kill Your Essay Score

Repetition, I’ve often noticed, often arises from a lack of confidence. Perhaps you’re afraid
that you haven’t been clear, so you repeat yourself just in case the reader didn’t get it. You
don’t trust yourself, or you don’t trust the reader. Either way, you blow the essay when you
go over the same ground again and again.
Writing concisely is a skill you can master. Before test day, take out some old papers or
reports. Go through them with a scalpel, cutting every unnecessary word you can find.
Choose a couple of fat sentences and put them on a diet. See if you can slim each from, say,
14 words to 10.
Writing Ideas in Random Order
Hopping around is good — if you’re a rabbit. If you’re an AP-exam writer, however, hopping
around is poison. Consider this example:
Nathaniel Hawthorne’s classic novel, The Scarlet Letter, is set in colonial New England.
The Puritans, an extremely strict religious group, condemn adultery. A single mother is
sentenced to jail. When she is released, she must wear a scarlet “A” on her clothing. The
mother never reveals the name of the baby’s father. The A is ornate; the embroidery
makes a decoration of what was meant to be a condemnation. The mother was actually
married, but the Puritans are unaware of that fact. The baby’s name is Pearl. The A
becomes a badge of honor. The Puritans at one point try to remove Pearl from her
mother’s care. The father doesn’t reveal his identity until late in the story, when his guilt
is overwhelming. Pearl stays with her mother.
The preceding sample essay excerpt skips from the scarlet letter A to the baby to the father
and back so many times that the grader will get whiplash from reading it. The moral of the
story? Be sure that your essay contains a logical thread that the reader can follow. (Check
out Chapter 3 for tips on structuring an essay.)

Chapter 21
Ten Ways to Increase Your Know-How
Without Studying
In This Chapter
 Developing literary skills while having fun
 Enjoying English-related activities that improve your skill
Just for the record: despite what the title of this chapter might imply, I heartily recom-
mend that you study for the AP English Literature and Composition exam. As a matter of
fact, only geniuses have a shot at passing the exam cold. And not even all geniuses!
However, while you’re prepping for test day (see Chapter 2 for a good schedule), you may
want to participate in a few, nonacademic activities that pump up the literary area of your
brain. This chapter describes those activities.
Attend Poetry Readings
It’s Friday night. What do you do? Go to a movie, attend a skateboard tournament, or maybe
boogie the night away at a school dance? Sometimes those are the best choices. As the old
saying goes, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” And Jacqueline, I should point out,
doesn’t do very well on a 24/7 study regimen either. However, sometimes you may want to
dip your toe into a more unusual (and perhaps more productive) leisure activity: poetry
readings.
Most major book chains, as well as many local stores, sponsor free poetry readings from
time to time. Some even serve food. And not all are on Friday night; check your local newspa-
per or the Internet for listings of nearby events. When you find one, pencil it into your calen-
dar. Not only will you have fun, but you’ll learn a lot too.
I suggest poetry readings because they’re the ones that give you the most additional informa-
tion about literature. However, readings from fiction and nonfiction works are also beneficial.
Either way, the authors’ comments and reactions from the audience may add to your under-
standing of the work.
At readings, imaginative people who spin words into beauty stand behind a podium and offer
their latest poems for your appreciation. Most poets comment on the inspiration for their
work. Be sure to listen when they divulge this information, because it gives you insights into
poetry and the creative process that you can’t get any other way. Just hearing poetry
changes the way you think about this genre; after all, poetry used to be nothing more than an
auditory experience.

Here’s a real-life example of the value of poetry readings: Dave Johnson, whose work appears
in this book, once visited my class to read his work. Dave comes from a long line of Southern
preachers, and their voices echo in his reading style. I’ve studied many of his poems (they’re
really good), but until I heard him read, I didn’t fully appreciate the sense of place and the
characterization that enriches his writing.
Besides, even if you don’t learn much about poetry, at a reading you may meet someone who
also likes movies, skateboard tournaments, and school dances. Then you’ll have a compan-
ion for the nights when you don’t want to exercise your poetic-appreciation muscles.
Write for School Publications
Writing for school publications can give you plenty of practice for the dreaded AP exam
essays. Don’t have any school publications? Start one. Fancy printing is nice, but all you
really need is a copier, a dream, and, depending on the rules of your school, a faculty advisor.
If your school does sponsor publications, submit your work. Consider these possibilities:
 Articles for the school newspaper: Because you’re on deadline with newspaper writ-
ing, you learn how to organize information and create a coherent structure quickly.
 Poems and stories for the school literary magazine: Writing poetry helps you under-
stand what goes into the creation of a poem. If you have to work out a rhyme scheme,
for instance, you know what it adds to the meaning. Similarly, creating characters or
tucking exposition into a prose scene helps you decode what other writers have done.
 Topical research for themed publications: My school has a feminist magazine, a social
science journal, a health publication, and about a dozen other publications. Writers for
these publications discover how to state a thesis and prove it — exactly what you have
to do in an AP essay.
It doesn’t really matter what you write or where your work appears (though a list of publica-
tions is an asset on your college application). In my opinion, writing ability is a muscle, and if
you exercise your muscles, they get stronger. So write something — anything — and do so as
often as you can.
Solve Crossword Puzzles
AP-level work relies on mature vocabulary, and a painless (okay, mostly painless) way to
increase your fund of words is to solve a daily or weekly puzzle from a local or national news-
paper. Bookstores also sell compilations of puzzles on various levels. Aim for puzzles with
difficult vocabulary (such as the one in the New York Times). And don’t forget to keep a dic-
tionary nearby so you can look up unfamiliar words. The first few puzzles you try may be
challenging, because it takes a while to get into the puzzle maker’s mindset. But stick with it,
and the puzzles will get easier. Your vocabulary will thank you, and your AP scores (not to
mention your SAT and ACT scores) will rise.
All those new words you come across in crosswords can help you decode AP passages, but
be wary of introducing newly acquired vocabulary into your essays. Graders grumble when
they encounter an essay packed with ten-syllable words. When I plow through an essay that’s
dense with obscure language, I often assume that the writer ate a vocabulary book for break-
fast and was determined to cough up every last word. Needless to say, I’m glad the writer has
learned vocabulary, but moderation is a virtue.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Give Your Library Card a Workout
When I say that you should give your library card a workout, I’m not talking about using it 
as a minifan on hot, humid, pre–AP test days. I’m talking about using the card to borrow
books . . . and then actually reading them. Yes, I’m aware that the title of this chapter con-
tains the phrase “without studying.” But, honestly, reading doesn’t have to be homework or
punishment. (Imagine: I sentence you to 20 years in the classic-novel penitentiary, with time off
for good behavior . . . .) Reading is a way to escape the real world — the one in which you
have to fill out college apps or feed your pet tarantula. If you find a book that grabs you,
everything else fades away.
However — you were waiting for that one loophole that ruined your plans to check out an
easy read, weren’t you? — you get the most benefit from reading quality literature. Check out
Appendix A for some great suggestions. Then settle down with a book that transports you,
entertains you, and as a side effect, raises your AP score.
Talk about Literature at Lunch
Okay, so lunching with literature may sound like a one-way ticket to Nerds Anonymous, but it
doesn’t have to be. Think of it this way: Everyone in your English class is probably reading
the same book or the same poems. Everyone has homework to do and tests to take. So if you
happen to bring up an argument that started in class and continued until the closing bell,
you’re actually helping yourself and your friends.
Not convinced? I don’t blame you. I probably wouldn’t have believed me either when I was
AP age. But now, as a teacher, I have lunch duty, the absolute most boring activity on the
planet, except perhaps for faculty meetings. Once a week, as I patrol for errant pickle slices
and airborne cole slaw, I listen. Sometimes — quite often, actually — I hear an interesting
conversation based on homework reading or classroom discussion.
Before you burn this page, try one thing. Come up with a single, debatable idea — something
catchy. Sit with your friends and unwrap that mystery-meat sandwich the cafeteria lady calls
“ham and cheese.” Before you take a bite, say something like “Hamlet has a lot in common
with Spiderman, you know? He doesn’t want to be special, but he doesn’t have much choice.
Neither does Spidey. Plus, they both lost father figures.” If no one throws a french fry at you,
you’re fine, and the discussion may actually take off. If you get hit with a french fry, experi-
ment at another table. Teachers teach, but so can students. And you can learn from both.
A lunch- or dinner-table conversation about literature can give you a great idea for a class
assignment or a test essay. However, if you use someone else’s idea without crediting the
source, you risk a plagiarism charge. Yes, even for a non-written, we-were-just-talking source.
So tell your teacher where that great analysis of Hamlet’s relationship with Gertrude came
from. Ask him or her the preferred way to cite — footnotes, endnotes, parentheticals, or just
a little personal note at the end of the essay (for example, “For the analysis of Hamlet’s rela-
tionship with Gertrude, I credit Peter Smith, my classmate”).

Listen to Debates and Arguments
The AP essay section checks whether you can assert an idea and defend it with solid evi-
dence. And not surprisingly, the AP English Literature and Composition exam concerns litera-
ture. But arguing effectively is a skill that can carry over from one subject area to another.
(Think about what would happen if you said something like this: “You want me to dry the
dishes? Let me explain why you will benefit from taking care of this chore yourself . . .”)
If your school has a debate team, a Model UN or similar organization, or a student govern-
ment, join in the fun. Or, if you have enough activities in your schedule to fill 32 hours a day,
simply attend a debate from time to time. At the event, listen carefully. Who made a good
case? Why? What did that particular debater do to convince you? What you learn by listening
to a sophisticated argument will improve your own ability to state your position regarding a
literary work, dish-drying, global warming, car-borrowing, curfews, and tons of other impor-
tant issues.
School isn’t the only place to master the art of debate and argument. You can easily debate
with your family at home about all sorts of fun issues. My son is a litigator, the type of attor-
ney that steps in when something is in dispute. In other words, he gets paid very well to
argue. I often remind him that he learned this skill at home, as we discussed everything from
which New York team had the better shortstop to the likely outcome of an election. If your
family is quieter than mine and debating isn’t a habit, you can also listen to debates on televi-
sion. As you listen, consider the relative effectiveness of each speaker and analyze how an
argument is presented. Adapt the same techniques as needed when you’re writing.
Go to the Theater (A Live One, That Is)
Drama exists in written form, but don’t forget that all those plays you’ve read and dissected
in English class were originally intended for performance. When you see actors inhabit the
roles, hear the words spoken aloud, and watch the interactions live, the play changes. Plus,
theater — from amateur productions in the school cafeteria to professional presentations on
Broadway — is an amazing experience for anyone.
Seeing a play that you’ve read affects your understanding of the work. Even better, if you
have the opportunity, is to see two productions of the same play. The directors’ and actors’
contributions become clear when you compare their interpretations.
I can hear you now: “What about films? Does going to see a movie based on a play count as
an AP grade-raising experience?” The answer is a definite maybe. If the film is well made, you
may learn just as much from it as you do from a staged performance. However, because the
two media have different requirements and conventions, film directors often change a lot
when they convert a theater script to a screenplay.
Use the live theater or film experience for “deep background” only. If you write about a work
you’ve been fortunate enough to watch on stage or at the movies, be sure to discuss the text,
not the little touches that the director, designers, and actors add (for example, movement on
stage, lighting design, costumes, facial expressions, or tone of voice). The AP exam is ori-
ented to the written word, not to performance.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Participate in English Class
The horror! I actually want you to stop doodling, ogling, gargling, burping, and all the other
things you enjoy doing while the teacher is babbling away about some ancient poem. (Not
that you’d ever do any such thing during class.) But in case you’re tempted, resist. Take full
advantage of the 45 or 50 minutes you have in the presence of an English teacher and other
students who are focused on literature. (Chapter 3 explains how to get the most mileage
from a high school English class, whether it carries the official AP designation or not.) Even if
your teacher speaks in a monotone so boring that the chalk tries to sneak out the door, you
can still learn something. And if you’re paying attention, you can participate by asking mean-
ingful questions. Then you can learn even more.
Consider this fact: The largest slice of every school’s budget is devoted to teachers’ salaries.
Therefore, the most valuable item in the school budget is teacher time (even though you may
beg to differ). So when you ask a question or make a comment, you have a chance to receive
feedback on your analysis of the work, to clarify misconceptions, and to liven up the discus-
sion. (Maybe then the chalk will even try to sneak back in . . . . )
Analyze Your Strengths and Make
the Most of Them
As you probably know by now, this book prepares you for the AP English Literature and
Composition exam. If you’re like most test-prep readers, you’re probably dipping into the
book to bolster your skills in areas of weakness. (Not that you have any!) However, you can
also benefit from thinking about your strong points. Here’s why: Suppose you’re very good at
interpreting poetry. For instance, perhaps you can latch onto a poem and draw meaning from
it the way aliens in sci-fi films inhale the flight crew’s essence as green glowing clouds waft
around the cabin. If you know you’re good at poetry, during the AP exam you can attach
yourself to the poetry multiple-choice or essay prompts first. Go with your strength, extract
maximum points, and then move on to things that are tougher for you — perhaps questions
on prose or drama.
You get the same number of points for any question you answer correctly. Go for the easy
ones, and return to the difficult questions later. And even then, be sure to answer only those
for which you can make an educated guess.
Sleep
Yes, I’m serious: I want you to sleep to increase your know-how. During the school year, you
may be tempted to burn the candle at both ends, while toasting the middle over a roaring
campfire. And guess what will happen if you do? You’ll burn out. Need I mention that cinders
and piles of ashes have very little brain power? Students who have to prop their eyes open
with toothpicks during the AP exam probably won’t produce their best work. And I’m not
just talking about AP week or even test day; I’m talking about the whole school year. Yes, you
have to get your homework done if it’s humanly possible. (And if it isn’t, you’re overcommit-
ted and need to cut back on your academic or extracurricular load.) However, staying up all
night to study for an exam or to instant message the entire senior class is counterproductive.
The moral of the story: When you’re tired, go to sleep. Wake up and hit the books as needed,
but don’t deprive yourself of sack-time.

Appendixes

In this part . . .
T
o fill the spare slots that gape in your daily planner
(.0009 seconds a day, right?), you may want to read
some great literature. Appendix A describes novels, plays,
and poems that have graced the “suggested works” list
provided by the AP exam writers for the open-ended
essay. You’ve probably read some, but you may find more
that interest you. Appendix B is a quick review of gram-
mar. Like the one in your body, this appendix isn’t really
necessary. You can ignore it unless something goes wrong.
However, if grammar ails you, I suggest that you spend
some quality time with Appendix B.

Appendix A
Literary Works
C
an I interest you in a good book? How about a hundred? Maybe a play or a slab of
poetry? Whatever your taste, something in this appendix should interest you. At one
time or another, the College Board has listed all these works (and more) as possible choices
for the third, open-ended essay on the AP English Literature and Composition exam. (For
more information on preparing for the open-ended essay, turn to Chapter 14.) You don’t
have to read all or even any of these works. Personally, though, I believe that every book
here merits your time and attention because each features beautiful writing, wisdom and
insight, and interesting and timeless subject matter. (In case you were wondering why I
became an English teacher . . . .)
The list in this appendix is divided by genre and includes novels, plays (written in both prose
and verse), and poetry. The titles are alphabetized, though I ignored “a,” “an,” and “the”
when I put them in order. I include the author, date of publication or performance, and a sen-
tence or two about each.
I assume that you’ve developed your own standards for quality literature. Not every work on
this list may meet those standards. For example, words that you can’t use in polite company
appear in some of these books. Others may describe situations that make you uncomfort-
able. I decline the role of censor, so consider yourself warned that you should proceed at
your own risk. Check my description, ask a trusted teacher or librarian, or thumb through a
work before you decide to read it. However, you will find that this list contains enough vari-
ety to suit everyone.
Poetry
Iliad (Homer, 7th–8th century BCE): One of the oldest poems, Homer’s Iliad describes the
war — in exquisite and excruciating detail — between the Greeks and the Trojans. If you’ve
read any Greek mythology, you’ll recognize these characters: Achilles, Paris, Hector,
Agamemnon, Odysseus, and many others.
“The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” (T.S. Eliot, 1915): A dramatic monologue, this poem
portrays the restlessness and disconnection that many see as a key facet of modern life. The
speaker invites the reader: “Let us go then, you and I.” Then the speaker takes the reader
through rooms where people “come and go / talking of Michelangelo” but never really
communicate.
Odyssey (Homer, 7th–8th century BCE): Odysseus has many adventures as he travels home
from the Trojan War. Meanwhile, his loyal wife Penelope and his son Telemachus gamely fend
off the suitors who are trying to steal Odysseus’s wife and kingdom.
The Rape of the Lock (Alexander Pope, 1612): A mock epic, this poem details how a
lovesick young man cuts a lock of hair from the head of his beloved; the poem also describes
the ensuing feud between the families of the pair. Based on a real incident, the poem was
written as an attempt to reconcile the families.

Novels
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Mark Twain, 1884): This is the classic American
road trip novel: Huck and escaped slave Jim travel by raft down the Mississippi. Woven
through Huck and Jim’s adventures are serious themes: coming of age, Huck’s maturation,
and race relations.
All the King’s Men (Robert Penn Warren, 1946): This novel describes a Southern politi-
cian’s rise from poverty to the governor’s mansion. The story is told by a staff member who’s
willing to cheat and blackmail to consolidate his boss’s power. The moral landscape is com-
plicated by the fact that the politician genuinely tries to help the poor.
As I Lay Dying (William Faulkner, 1930): The Bundren family takes a horrific journey to
bury a deceased relative. During their journey, the family questions family ties, tradition, the
nature of existence, and the impossibility of human communication. The novel has many nar-
rators, so keep a scorecard handy as you read.
The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man (James Weldon Johnson, 1912): The son of a
white man and a black woman, who’s also known as the “ex-colored man,” narrates his path
from a little boy unaware of race to his decision as an adult to “pass” as white. Johnson criti-
cizes race relations and addresses issues of identity and justice.
The Awakening (Kate Chopin, 1899): The Awakening is an early feminist classic: The wife of
a staid businessman leaves her home, family, and marriage for an affair. Later she drowns —
perhaps a suicide. Women’s roles, the nature of marriage, individual desires, destiny versus
obligation, and the role of art are all themes.
Beloved (Toni Morrison, 1987): An escaped slave kills her child rather than see the baby live
in slavery. Elements of magical realism (the child returns) illuminate the process by which
people recover from traumatic events. Themes include the power one should or shouldn’t
have over others, racial identity, and the role of community.
Catch 22 (Joseph Heller, 1961): If you’re sane enough to want out of the army, you’re too
sane for a discharge by reason of insanity — the “Catch 22” of the title. Set during World War
II, the novel criticizes the military, war, bureaucracy, and pretty much everything else.
The Catcher in the Rye (J.D. Salinger, 1951): Holden Caulfield narrates his odyssey in New
York City after he’s expelled from school. Searching for innocence and hating “phonies,”
Holden gradually disintegrates as he parties, visits his little sister, and realizes that every-
thing changes over time.
The Color Purple (Alice Walker, 1982): Celie, a woman raised by an abusive father and mar-
ried off to an abusive husband, writes letters to God and to her sister, Nettie. Even though
Celie suffers, she becomes stronger through her relationship with Shug, her husband’s mis-
tress, and other friends. Gender roles and the power of friendship are key.
A Farewell to Arms (Ernest Hemingway, 1929): Set in Italy during World War II, this novel
follows the relationship between an ambulance driver and his lover. War, love during
wartime, and gender roles are all important themes.
Frankenstein (Mary Shelley, 1817): Frankenstein isn’t just a monster story! Shelley’s famous
tale of a scientist who fabricates life considers the responsibility of the creator for the cre-
ated, the effect of society on an innocent individual, the nature of learning, and a host of
other ideas. You’ll be left wondering who the real monster is.
334
Part VII: Appendixes 

Great Expectations (Charles Dickens, 1860–1861): Working-class orphan Pip meets an
eccentric rich lady and the beautiful Estella. His expectations change, especially after he
hears that a mysterious benefactor will fund his transformation into a gentleman. 
The Great Gatsby (F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1925): In this “Roaring Twenties” tale, Jay Gatsby
yearns for the love of his youth. When she reappears — married — the relationship between
Jay and his beloved becomes complicated and tragic. The nature of the American Dream, the
role of wealth, and the ability of people to reinvent themselves are central to this story.
Gulliver’s Travels (Jonathan Swift, 1626): Gulliver visits four fantastic lands — one popu-
lated by tiny creatures, one by giants, one by philosophers living on a floating island, and
one ruled by intelligent horses. These strange creatures are vehicles for criticism of human
nature, culture, and society. The tone is harshly satiric.
Heart of Darkness (Joseph Conrad, 1899): Set in London and the Congo during the era of
colonization, this novel explores the nature of “civilization” as a European company exploits
Africans. One employee, Kurtz, lives in the interior of Africa and abandons European cus-
toms. Themes include colonialism and the definition of civilization.
Invisible Man (Richard Wright, 1952): The title character, an African American man, tells
the story of his life, beginning in a Southern college and moving through his experiences in a
Northern factory, a protest movement, and finally as an “invisible” man living underground.
Alienation, racism, and the risks of rigid belief systems are all themes here.
Jane Eyre (Charlotte Brönte, 1847): Orphan Jane, after a difficult childhood, becomes gov-
erness to the ward of Mr. Rochester. And then there’s that strange noise in the attic . . .
Though this is a serious coming-of-age story, it’s also an intriguing mystery and romance.
The Joy Luck Club (Amy Tan, 1989): Tan’s novel follows four pairs of mothers and daugh-
ters, all Chinese American. The pairs see things differently (what else is new?), but some
resolve their conflicts and grow closer to each other. Immigrants’ struggles, family relation-
ships, the importance of culture, and the effect of assimilation are key.
The Lord of the Flies (William Golding, 1954): A plane crashes after an unexplained global
disaster, and two bands of boys find that they’re alone on a mysterious island. Their efforts
to form a society, the gradual dissolution of civilized behavior, and a killer ending make this
one worth your time.
The Metamorphosis (Franz Kafka, 1915): Gregor wakes up one morning and finds that he
has become a giant bug. His family isn’t happy, his boss fires him, and he struggles to sur-
vive. Symbols abound in this novella.
Moby-Dick (Herman Melville, 1851): Captain Ahab has a wooden leg; his flesh-and-blood
limb was lost fighting Moby-Dick, a legendary white whale. Now Ahab wants revenge. The
nature of obsession is Topic A here. This book is great for “man-against-nature” essays.
Mrs. Dalloway (Virginia Woolf, 1925): A society woman throws a party while a shell-
shocked veteran disintegrates. These characters don’t know each other and never meet, but
their stories entwine as Woolf considers memory, choices, war and its aftermath, and other
all-important themes.
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (James Joyce, 1916): Stephen Daedalus grows up
and is faced with a decision between religion and art. Given the title, guess which one he
chooses? However, the point of this book is the forces that shape one’s destiny, creativity,
and outlook on life. The novel attempts an answer.
335
Appendix A: Literary Works

Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen, 1813): The five Bennet daughters have little dowry, an
unconcerned father, and an idiotic mother who schemes to find marriage partners for all of
them. This comedy of manners is serious about female power, hypocrisy and sincerity, and
the human tendency to, well, pride and prejudice.
The Scarlet Letter (Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1850): Hester Prynne has a baby out of wedlock.
Who’s the father? She’s not talking, but as she wears a scarlet letter A embroidered on her
clothes, she gradually achieves redemption. The father, on the other hand . . . Read it
and see.
Their Eyes Were Watching God (Zora Neale Hurston, 1937): Janie has three husbands in
this novel, and each relationship teaches her something about life. Hurston, an anthropolo-
gist as well as a novelist, paints a realistic portrait of an African American community in the
early 20th century. This novel is also a classic coming-of-age story.
Things Fall Apart (Chinua Achebe, 1959): The main character lives in a pre-colonial African
village. His family’s disgrace and redemption are described as well as the European coloniz-
ers’ clueless view of African customs. Colonialism, father-son relationships, gender roles, and
the definition of civilization are important in this book.
Wuthering Heights (Emily Brönte, 1847): Heathcliff, a foundling child, falls hard for Cathy,
but this novel isn’t a love story. Instead, the novel traces a history of obsession and revenge
through several generations. The brooding setting adds atmosphere.
Plays
Antigone (Sophocles, 5th century BCE): A classic Greek drama, this play centers on the con-
flicts between God and the state and nation and family. The title character buries her traitor-
ous brother despite the ruler’s prohibition. Her “crime” is justified, she believes, because the
gods mandate burial of the dead and because she has a familial obligation.
The Crucible (Arthur Miller, 1952): Set during the Salem witch hunt, this play actually
attacks the Red Scare of 1950s America. Miller’s hero, John Proctor, is asked to sign a false
confession in order to save his life, but Proctor refuses to compromise his name. The power
of the state, individual conscience, and husband-wife conflict are key.
Dancing at Lughnasa (Brian Friel, 1990): The narrator of this play is Michael Munday, an
adult reflecting on the summer when he was seven years old. The relationships between the
five Munday daughters and one son are explored. Themes include tradition/change, Irish
identity, and family conflict.
A Doll’s House (Henrik Ibsen, 1879): In A Doll’s House, Nora, a devoted wife, forges a signa-
ture to obtain a loan that will pay for the lifesaving cure her husband needs. When someone
threatens to expose the fraud, the strains in Nora’s marriage, the shallowness of her life, and
two opposing views of morality are revealed.
The Glass Menagerie (Tennessee Williams, 1944): Imagine it: You’ve got a Southern Belle
mother, a shy daughter, and a new guy who visits. Sounds like trouble, and it is. Important
issues: the nature of memory, idealized vision of the past, parental expectations, and family
relationships.
Hamlet (Shakespeare, 1600–1602): Hamlet, the greatest Shakespearean tragedy, takes you
into the mind of the title character, who’s charged with avenging his father’s murder.
336
Part VII: Appendixes 

Appearance/reality, mortality, human will, emotion/intellect/action, justice, and a host of
other important ideas show up in this play. 
Joe Turner’s Come and Gone (August Wilson, 1988): This play details the so-called “Great
Migration” of African Americans from the South to Northern cities at the beginning of the
20th century. The protagonist, Harold, is searching for his wife but also for his own identity.
Themes considered include memory, identity, and one’s relation to the past.
A Long Day’s Journey into Night (Eugene O’Neill, 1957): This play is a family party that
you’d rather not attend: the Tyrone family includes a morphine addict, an alcoholic, and a
tuberculosis victim, as well as a strong tendency to fight the same battles over and over
again. They’re all imprisoned in the past.
Macbeth (Shakespeare, 1603–1606): A war hero who’s the title character of this play is
tempted by predictions from three witches that he will become king. Initially against the idea,
Macbeth bows to his wife’s pressure and murders King Duncan. It’s all downhill from there as
the Macbeths descend into madness and evil. 
Man and Superman (G.B. Shaw, 1903): Based loosely on the Don Juan legend, Shaw’s play
concerns John Tanner, a confirmed bachelor and, well, a Don Juan. As in Pygmalion (another
tirade against marriage), this play considers the effect of societal norms on male and female
behavior.
Medea (Euripides, 5th century BCE): When abandoned by her husband, Jason, Medea plots
revenge. In fact, she isn’t above killing her children just to make Jason suffer more. This play
proves that the ancient Greeks understood obsessive love, jealousy, and vengeance every bit
as much as Hollywood does.
Murder in the Cathedral (T.S. Eliot, 1935): The real-life murder of Archbishop Thomas
Becket is the source for Eliot’s drama, which details the struggle between individual con-
science and secular power. Becket is visited by three tempters who try to lure him away from
his convictions. They fail and he dies, poetically.
Oedipus Rex (Sophocles, 5th century BCE): The drama by which all other dramas are meas-
ured, this play illustrates the downfall of Oedipus, once the savior and now the ruler of
Thebes, who unwittingly killed his own father and married his mother. The themes of fate,
free will, the will of the gods, and human ignorance have never been better explained.
The Piano Lesson (August Wilson, 1987): Should you sell an heirloom piano? Not if it’s
haunted. In this play, a family argues about whether to get rid of the piano, which is deco-
rated with carvings representing the faces of their enslaved ancestors. African American
identity and heritage top the list of important themes here.
A Raisin in the Sun (Lorraine Hansberry, 1959): An African American family buys a home,
and their neighbors try to bribe them into moving out of the white neighborhood. Issues
include the importance of dreams and the need to combat prejudice.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (Tom Stoppard, 1967): Stoppard reinvents
Hamlet by focusing on two minor characters from Shakespeare’s play who are killed by
Hamlet almost as an afterthought. Their lives, however, are not an afterthought to
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, who are puppets of forces beyond their control.
Trifles (Susan Glaspell, 1916): In this short play that packs a punch, two women wait in the
kitchen of a farmhouse where a man has been murdered by his wife. While the sheriff investi-
gates upstairs, the women discover the small, domestic items that identify the woman’s
motive for the crime.
337
Appendix A: Literary Works

Twelfth Night (Shakespeare, 1600–1602): A woman pretending to be a man falls in love with
a man (Orsino) who sends her as his love emissary to another woman, Viola, who falls in
love with the woman messenger that she thinks is a man. Confused yet? 
Waiting for Godot (Samuel Beckett, 1949): Two tramps sit on a bare stage and wait for
Godot (a stand-in for God) and illustrate existentialist philosophy while trading hugely enter-
taining wisecracks. They discuss religion, the meaning of existence, and lots of other stuff.
Interpretations abound.
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf (Edward Albee, 1962): A drunken foursome — two married
couples — spend the evening quarreling. Eventually the tragedy at the heart of the older
couple’s life is revealed. (No, I won’t tell you what it is.) Dreams, the lies people tell them-
selves, and spousal relationships are all illustrated by this play.

Quick Grammar Review
G
rammar. It’s a little word, but it’s a big headache. Don’t worry, though. This appendix
is the aspirin. If you’re a little rusty on any topic, check out the examples and the rules
I include here. Just don’t forget to apply them when you write your AP English essay.
Grammar rules and examples could fill a whole book. (As a matter of fact, I’ve personally
filled two whole books: English Grammar For Dummies and English Grammar Workbook For
Dummies, both published by Wiley.) But here I have only a few pages, so I concentrate on the
essentials that often trip up AP exam takers.
Complete Sentences versus Fragments 
and Run-Ons
When you’re writing a novel or a poem or anything informal, you’re allowed to write frag-
ments (incomplete sentences) or run-ons (more than one sentence improperly joined). In a
proper AP English essay, however, you should stick to complete sentences, which need the
following:
 A verb (a word expressing action or state of being)
 A subject (whoever or whatever is doing the action or is in the state of being)
 A complete thought
Here’s what I mean:
Fragment: Because I painted each toe a different color.
Why it’s a fragment: You have a subject (“I”) and a verb (“painted”), but the word
“because” implies cause and effect, and no effect is stated.
Sentence: Because I painted each toe a different color, my feet attracted attention.
Run-on: I painted each toe a different color, my feet attracted attention.
Why it’s a run-on: Two complete thoughts are linked only by a comma. Penalty box! A
comma isn’t allowed to join sentences.
Sentence: I painted each toe a different color; my feet attracted attention.
Another sentence: I painted each toe a different color, and my feet attracted attention.
These words are often mistakenly used to link two complete thoughts: “nevertheless,” “con-
sequently,” “however,” “then,” and “furthermore.” Feel free to employ these perfectly good
words in your writing, though. Just insert a semicolon as an officially approved link:
My pink pinky broke when I stubbed it; however, my turquoise big toe was fine.

Noun-Verb and Noun-Pronoun Agreement
“Agreement” is the English teacher term for the rule that singular goes with singular and
plural goes with plural. They don’t mix, ever. Agreement problems crop up when you’re
choosing a verb or a pronoun. I explain both situations in the following sections.
Subject-verb agreement
When subjects and verbs pair off, the mating may be smooth or disastrous. (Quite a few par-
allels to human pairing, don’t you think?) Here are some examples of correct matches:
My feet are drying under the sun lamp. (“Feet” is a plural subject and “are drying” is a
plural verb.)
My left foot is burning. (“Foot” is a singular subject and “is burning” is a singular verb.)
Agreement problems often appear when something intrudes between the subject and
the verb:
Incorrect pairing: My right foot, as well as Oscar’s and Melinda’s feet, are toasty.
Why it’s incorrect: The expression “as well as Oscar’s and Melinda’s feet” interrupts the
true subject-verb pair. Grammatically, it isn’t a factor when you match a verb to “foot.”
Correction: My right foot, as well as Oscar’s and Melinda’s feet, is toasty. (“Foot” is a sin-
gular subject and “is” is a singular verb.)
Mistakes abound when these interrupters appear: “as well as,” “along with,” “in addition to,”
“not including,” and “except.” Ignore the intruders, no matter what form they take. Simply
match the subject and the verb, singular to singular and plural to plural.
Sentences with “either/or” and “neither/nor” have two subjects. They’re simple, if you have a
ruler or even a finger handy. Simply match the verb to the closest subject. Check out these
examples:
Neither Ella nor her parents were happy with the new apartment. (The plural subject
“parents” matches the plural verb “were.”)
Either her parents or Ella is planning major renovations. (The singular subject “Ella”
matches the singular verb “is planning.”)
Pronoun agreement
Pronouns can also create agreement problems. These pronouns are always singular and,
when they’re subjects, always take singular verbs: “either,” “neither,” “each,” “every,” “one,”
“anyone,” “no one,” “someone,” “everyone,” “anything,” “nothing,” “something,” “every-
thing,” “anybody,” “nobody,” “somebody,” “everybody.” To make your life even more miser-
able, any pronoun referring to one of these singular pronouns must also be singular. Here are
some examples:
Each of the shoes is covered with mud, especially on its toe. (“Each” is a singular pro-
noun, “is” is a singular verb, and “its” is a singular pronoun referring to “each.”)
340
Part VII: Appendixes 

Everybody is required to bring his or her cheat sheet to the exam. (“Everybody” is a sin-
gular pronoun, “is required” is a singular verb, and “his or her” is a singular pronoun
expression.)
A very common mistake is to pair “everybody” with “their.” I sympathize. “Everybody”
sounds like a plural word, but it’s actually singular. Think for a moment; you don’t say “every-
body are here.” You say “everybody is here.” Singular all the way!
A real pronoun-agreement headache strikes when you’re talking about “one of the” or “the
only one.” (This type of sentence is a pronoun issue, though the problem comes when you
select a matching verb.) Scan this sentence:
George is one of the boys who (think/thinks) the Yankees are unbeatable.
The key to solving this sort of puzzle is to figure out the meaning of “who.” After you know
whether “who” is singular or plural, the verb choice is a cinch. Use logic. For instance,
according to the sentence, who thinks the Yankees are unbeatable? Some boys do. “Boys” is
a plural, so “who” is plural, as is the verb:
George is one of the boys who think the Yankees are unbeatable.
Contrast the preceding example with this sentence:
George is the only one of the boys who (think/thinks) Jeter is a great shortstop.
Apply logic again. Who thinks Jeter is a great shortstop? According to the sentence,
only George. Therefore “who” must refer to George and must be singular, paired with a
singular verb:
George is the only one of the boys who thinks Jeter is a great shortstop.
By the way, I also think Derek Jeter is a great shortstop. Sadly, I realize that the Yanks some-
times lose.
Pronoun Case
Case is the term English teachers apply to the quality that distinguishes between “who,”
“whom,” and “whose,” “he,” “him,” and “his,” and “they,” “them,” and “their.” The pronouns
divide into these three sets:
Subject pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they, who, whoever
Object pronouns: me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom, whomever
Possessive pronouns: my, mine, your, yours, his, her, hers, its, our, ours, their, theirs,
whose
The rules governing these pronouns are fairly simple: Use subject pronouns as subjects, pos-
sessive pronouns to indicate ownership, and object pronouns for everything else. Objects
show up in many different situations; don’t waste your time learning all of them. The process
of elimination works fine. If you don’t need a subject or a possessive, go for an object.
341
Appendix B: Quick Grammar Review

In simple sentences, the proper pronoun nearly always leaps naturally from your pen. Errors
occur in complicated sentences. So uncomplicate your life by untangling a difficult sentence
into its component thoughts. Then you generally “hear” the right answer, as in this example:
Complicated sentence: Jenny, (who/whom) I think is the best candidate, will never win
the election.
Untangled: (1) Jenny will never win the election (2) I think (3) who/whom is the best
candidate
Right choice: who
After you compare “who is the best candidate” with “whom is the best candidate” the choice
is a no-brainer.
Pronoun Clarity
Earlier in this appendix, I explain how to choose a singular or plural pronoun and how to stay
in the correct case. In this section, I tackle clarity, which is arguably more important in an AP
essay than any other factor. Why? Because if the graders can’t figure out what you’re saying,
you’re in trouble.
One problem shows up when the sentence refers to two males or two females, as in the fol-
lowing sentence:
Gertrude and Ophelia discuss her relationship with Hamlet.
Whose relationship are we talking about? The Gertrude-Hamlet relationship or the Ophelia-
Hamlet one? Beats me. The sentence gives no clue. Corrections for this error may be simple-
but-clunky or they may call for a complete rewrite:
Simple but clunky: Gertrude and Ophelia discuss Ophelia’s relationship with Hamlet.
Why it’s clunky: Placing Ophelia and Ophelia’s next to each other is repetitious.
Smoother rewrite: Gertrude and Ophelia discuss the girl’s relationship with Hamlet.
(Gertrude, Hamlet’s mother, is too old to be a girl.)
The pronouns “this,” “that,” and “which” also tend to muddle your essay. Check out this
example:
Muddled sentence: The king kneels to pray, and Hamlet decides not to kill him, which is
a problem.
Why it’s muddled: What’s the problem? That the king is praying, or that Hamlet decides
not to kill him?
Correction: The problem is that Hamlet decides not to kill the kneeling, prayerful king.
The preceding “muddled” sentence is illegal for another reason too. According to the laws of
grammar (which are enforced by legions of English teachers), a pronoun may replace a noun
(a person, place, or thing) or another pronoun. A pronoun isn’t allowed to replace a subject-
verb pair, a sentence, or anything else. In the “muddled” sentence, “which” refers to “The
king kneels to pray,” to “Hamlet decides not to kill him,” or to both. Verdict: two years of hard
labor in the grammar penitentiary.
342
Part VII: Appendixes 

Verb Tense
This topic isn’t a discussion of how you feel when you enter the exam room. In the context of
grammar, tense means time, as in when the action happened, is happening, or will happen.
You have very few tense decisions to make in an AP English essay because by tradition, liter-
ature is discussed in present tense. If you’re writing an essay centered on one event in a
novel, play, or poetic narrative, opt for present tense when you’re talking about that event:
Hamlet fights Laertes, who wounds Hamlet, and in turn is wounded by Hamlet.
Gertrude, unaware of Claudius’s schemes, drinks from the poisoned cup.
Here’s one exception to the present-tense-for-literature rule: Anything earlier than the key
event you’re discussing may be in past tense. For example:
Before the duel, Hamlet enraged Laertes by killing Polonius. Laertes also blames Hamlet
for his sister’s madness. Earlier, Laertes was so angry that he fought Hamlet at his
sister’s grave.
If your essay ranges over several events, stay with present tense, as in the following lines:
Hamlet feigns madness when he confronts Ophelia in her private room and later when
he spars with Polonius. His behavior during the play-within-a-play scene also borders on
madness, as he interrupts the actors.
Two words, “has” and “have,” may indicate action begun in the past and continuing in the
present:
Hamlet has agonized about his inaction, and in this soliloquy he berates himself again.
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern have attempted to win Hamlet’s trust several times, and
Hamlet is bitter about their betrayal.
Adjective and Adverb Placement
Descriptive words or expressions belong near the words they describe so that the meaning is
crystal clear. Take a look at these examples:
Refined sugar works best in this recipe. (“Refined” describes “recipe.”)
A cup of sugar, refined or raw, should be added to the batter. (“Refined or raw”
describes “sugar.”)
Stir the batter thoroughly. (“Thoroughly” describes “stir.”)
When the batter is smooth, pour it into the pan. (“When the batter is smooth” describes
“pour.”)
The baseball, which had been caught by a Red Sox fan, was displayed in the museum.
(The phrase “which had been caught by a Red Sox fan” describes “baseball.”)
The general rule is easy to remember, but a couple of situations may trip you up:
Common mistake: Heating the sauce, the pan may tip.
Why it’s a mistake: Who’s heating the sauce? No one.
343
Appendix B: Quick Grammar Review

Correction: Heating the sauce, the cook should avoid tipping the pan.
Common mistake: Stirring the gravy frequently ruins the taste.
Why it’s a mistake: What does “frequently” describe — how often the gravy is stirred or
how often the taste is ruined? Because “frequently” is right in the middle of two, the sen-
tence is unclear.
One possible correction: Stirring the gravy tends to ruin the taste. (Sometimes the best
way to fix this sort of error is to change the descriptive word.)
Another possible correction: Frequent stirring of the gravy ruins the taste.
Common mistake: I paid for the fender I dented with a cashier’s check.
Why it’s a mistake: No matter what kind of check it is, a piece of paper can’t dent a
fender.
Correction: With a cashier’s check, I paid for the fender I dented.
The word “only” should come with a warning label because it’s misplaced so often. These
sentences have different meanings, which I’ve placed in parentheses:
Only Ellen ate supper at home. (Her friends went to a restaurant.)
Ellen only ate supper at home. (She was in the house just for a few minutes, enough to
scarf down a plate of spaghetti. Then she went out.)
Ellen ate only supper at home. (She dined out for breakfast and lunch.)
Ellen ate supper only at home. (She refused to eat supper at her friends’ houses or in
restaurants.)
Parallelism
Math fans and art majors, rejoice! Everything you know about parallel lines helps you avoid
errors in parallelism when you’re writing. Here’s the deal: When you list ideas in a sentence,
their formats need to be the same. Sounds simple, but in practice, parallel errors abound. For
example, consider these:
Not parallel: Edward learns to speak softly, to carry a big stick, and how to communi-
cate with wild animals.
Why it isn’t parallel: Edward learns three things, all listed in the sentence. One has the
word “how” tacked on, and the other two don’t.
Parallel: Edward learns to speak softly, to carry a big stick, and to communicate with
wild animals.
Another common parallelism problem stems from paired conjunctions. (A conjunction is a
word that joins, such as “and,” “but,” “because,” “since,” and so on.) The pairs I’m talking
about are “not only/but,” “either/or,” and “neither/nor.” The rule is that anything these pairs
join must have the same grammatical identity. You can link two sentences, two nouns, two
adjectives, or two anythings, as long as you don’t mix the pairs. Check these out:
Not parallel: Elizabeth not only danced all night, but she also sang the blues.
Why it isn’t parallel: After “not only” you have “danced all night” — just a verb without
a subject. After “but” you have a subject-verb pair: “she . . . sang.”
344
Part VII: Appendixes 

Correction: Elizabeth not only danced all night but also sang the blues.
Why it’s parallel: After “not only” comes a verb, “danced.” After “but” comes a verb,
“sang.” Two verbs indicate parallelism.
Not parallel: Either I will go to the movies or to the mall.
Why it isn’t parallel: After “either” comes a complete sentence: “I will go to the mall.”
After “or” you have only “to the mall,” which isn’t a complete sentence.
Correction: I will go either to the movies or to the mall.
Differentiating between Confusing Words
A few word pairs that frequent AP English essays come with built-in sand traps; they’re just
waiting for you to fall in. Be careful to use them correctly.
Affect / Effect The first is usually a verb, the second a noun:
Ahab’s quest for the whale affects the sailors’ lives.
Ahab’s quest for the whale has an effect on the sailors’ lives.
Uninterested / Disinterested The first means you don’t care, the second means you’re fair:
Ahab was relatively uninterested in the blue whale.
The disinterested narrator reports all sides of the story.
Its / It’s The first is a possessive pronoun, and the second is a contraction of “it is”:
Her plan is simple, but its execution is not.
It’s obvious that her plan will fail.
Allusion / Illusion The first is a literary term, a reference to something outside the literary
work. The second is a fantasy:
The allusion to the Declaration of Independence emphasizes the speaker’s patriotism.
Willy clings to the illusion that he will again become a great salesman.
Speaker / Narrator The first is the “I” voice in poetry. The second is the “I” voice in prose:
In Dylan Thomas’s poem “Fern Hill,” the speaker is an older man reflecting on his child-
hood.
Melville’s famous novel begins with the narrator’s command: “Call me Ishmael.”
Paragraph / Stanza The first is a division of prose (a novel, a story, or a nonfiction account),
and the second is a division of a poem:
The first paragraph of the essay establishes the author’s argument.
The third stanza marks a shift in poetic technique.
