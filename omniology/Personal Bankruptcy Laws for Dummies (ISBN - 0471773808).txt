About the Authors
James P. Caher, a practicing attorney with 30 years of experience, is a nation-
ally recognized expert on consumer bankruptcies and authority on the
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.
Jim coauthored, with his brother John, Debt Free! Your Guide to Personal
Bankruptcy Without Shame (Henry Holt, 1996) and two highly regarded books
for lawyers: Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy (LRP, 1997) and
Discharging Credit Card Debts in Bankruptcy (LRP, 1998).
In addition, Jim has published scores of articles for bankruptcy professionals
and is frequently called upon to analyze and interpret the complicated provi-
sions of the 2005 bankruptcy law. He was labeled the “online guru” by a
national legal weekly because of his regular appearances on the Internet as
an expert analyst on bankruptcy law. Jim also serves on the editorial board of
the American Bankruptcy Institute.
Jim graduated from Niagara University and then earned his law degree from
Memphis State University Law School, where he was a member of the Law
Review and recipient of the American Jurisprudence Award for Excellence in
the field of debtor-creditor relations. He filed his first consumer bankruptcy
case shortly after graduating in 1975. Jim lives and practices in Eugene,
Oregon.
John M. Caher is a legal journalist who has written about law and the courts
for most of his 25-year career.
Currently the Albany bureau chief for the New York Law Journal, John previ-
ously was state editor and legal affairs reporter for the Times Union of Albany,
New York. His legal reportage has won more than two dozen awards, including
prestigious honors from the American Bar Association, the New York State Bar
Association, the Erie County Bar Association, and the Associated Press.
John coauthored, with his brother Jim, Debt Free! Your Guide to Personal
Bankruptcy Without Shame (Henry Holt, 1996). He is the author of King 
of the Mountain: The Rise, Fall and Redemption of Chief Judge Sol Wachtler
(Prometheus Books, 1998). In addition, John was the principal writer assist-
ing former U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon in preparation of his
memoirs. Mr. Simon’s autobiography, A Time for Reflection, was published in
2003 by Regnery. 
John is a 1980 graduate of Utica College of Syracuse University, where he
received his bachelor’s degree in journalism, and a 1993 graduate of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, where he earned a master’s degree in tech-
nical communications/graphics. John lives in Clifton Park, New York.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of our parents, James C. and Dolores
Caher (a.k.a. “Big Jim and Fitz”), who died way before their time but left us
with their own life examples of personal responsibility, fairness, justice, affin-
ity for the underdog, basic decency, and common sense. It is also dedicated
to the five grandchildren they should have known and would have adored
and enjoyed beyond measure: Sean and Brendan Caputi of East Aurora, 
New York, and Erin, Kerry, and Norah Caher of Clifton Park, New York.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
For the second edition of this book, just like the first, our respective spouses
Kate Donnelly and Kathleen Caher were there every step of the way with
their love, support, and encouragement. 
Also for the second edition of our book, just like the first, Michael J. O’Connor
took time from his busy law practice to offer expert analysis of our effort.
Mike, an outstanding bankruptcy attorney in his own right and prominent
partner in O’Connor O’Connor Mayberger & First PC in Albany, New York, has
always been there when we needed him, and we would like to publicly
acknowledge our humble appreciation for his efforts.
We also acknowledge the continuing dedication of our long-time agent, Sheree
Bykofsky of Sheree Bykofsky Associates in Manhattan, and the insights of the
talented folks at Wiley Publishing who made this come together, especially our
project editor, Kelly Ewing, and acquisitions editor, Stacy Kennedy.

Introduction
W
elcome to the second edition of Personal Bankruptcy Law For 
Dummies — your antidote to BARF (Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco).
You’re probably in financial trouble, or you wouldn’t have picked up this
book. Unfortunately, your troubles got a lot more complicated in October
2005, when a law new drastically altered the time-honored and court-tested
rules of bankruptcy and changed much of what we told you in the first 
edition.
It’s officially called the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 — a euphemism if ever there was one. Many judges
and other bankruptcy judges know it by a more colorful and, we think, more
accurate name: BARF. And that’s how we generally refer to it in this book.
BARF was bought and paid for by creditors, and there’s almost nothing in this
501-page “amendment” to the Bankruptcy Code that spells anything but “indi-
gestion” for the average consumer. That said, there are ways to keep BARF at
bay. If you know some tricks, you’ll make out just fine. You just have to know
where to step and not step. In this book, we show you the way.
About This Book
If you ever go to Ireland, an Irish phrase that you just have to know is “It’s
clearly signposted all the way.” It usually comes up in a tavern, or anywhere
else you may stop to ask for directions. Invariably, you’ll be sent on your
merry way with these promising words.
Now, the ignorant may assume that phrase means that the way to your desti-
nation is obvious, and prominent signs appear anywhere you can make a
wrong turn. But, what a foolish assumption! What it really means is that no
such signs are anywhere to be found, and you’re going to get hopelessly lost.
That’s how our ancestors got here. One wrong turn in Dublin, and, the next
thing they knew, they were in Buffalo.
What’s that have to do with bankruptcy? Nothing, except that most of the
bankruptcy books we’ve encountered are “clearly signposted all the way”
and about half as understandable as an Irish roundabout. Do you go around
the traffic circle to the left or right when you drive on the left, and how come
there’s a cow in the passing lane? You just can’t get there from here without
wading through a mountain of manure.

So we, The Brothers Caher, decided to make the world of bankruptcy a little
more intelligible and a little more navigable. Yeah, we thought about fixing
Ireland first, but getting lost adds to the fun and charm of our ancestral
homeland. Nothing’s fun or charming about getting lost in the dragon-
plagued dungeons of bankruptcy law, especially when it’s raining BARF.
Conventions Used in This Book
We’re pretty conventional guys, and here are some of the conventions used in
the book:
Debtor is you, the person who owes someone else money. Also, a person filing
bankruptcy is called a debtor instead of a “bankruptcy.” Court, unless otherwise
stated, means U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Trustee is the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
trustee. Credit-card company refers to banks and other lending institutions that
issue loans processed by companies like Visa and MasterCard.
BARF (Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco) is the monument to Murphy’s Law
that made such a mess of consumer bankruptcies.
And Congress refers to the knuckleheads in Washington who replaced a law
they didn’t understand with one they haven’t read to fix a problem that doesn’t
exist, requiring you to wallow in BARF and us to rewrite our book.
What You’re Not to Read
Feel free to cherry pick. If you’re looking for just-the-facts-ma’am, gloss over
the aptly designated Technical Stuff (you can always go back if you need
more than a bird’s eye view). You can skate by the anecdotes (all tagged with
an icon) and the sidebars (the stuff printed on gray background) as well.
Foolish Assumptions
We assume that you understand the English language and never went to law
school. To that end, unless we tell you otherwise, a word means what it
means in plain-old English, not legalese. If we’re about to get all lawyerly on
you, we warn you.

How This Book Is Organized
So you’re thinking that perhaps, just perhaps, bankruptcy is your way out?
You may be right. We guide you through all the thickets of bankruptcy law so
that you can figure that one out for yourself. This book covers everything
you need to know, and we’ve tried real hard to organize a ton of material so
that you can immediately put it to practical use. Here’s a brief rundown of
what you find in each section of the book.
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture
Torn over the question of whether bankruptcy is for you? The aim of this first
part is simply to put your mind at ease and get you to evaluate the bank-
ruptcy option on a simple, objective, intelligent standard: Do the benefits out-
weigh the drawbacks? We explain the process and the pitfalls and, as an
added bonus, we describe some quick and effective ways to immediately
stop the financial bloodletting. We also include a brand new chapter just on
the “Means Test,” the lynchpin of BARF.
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy
Most folks will do almost anything to avoid bankruptcy, and all too many only
make matters worse by putting off that day of reckoning. We understand your
reluctance to file bankruptcy (although in our experience, people are usually
better off filing bankruptcy sooner rather than later). In this section, we
explain a variety of debt-busting techniques to keep the bill collectors off
your back until you get on your feet again.
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff
The credit industry would have you believe that when you file bankruptcy, an
army of predators and scavengers descends on the tranquility of your home-
stead and yanks the bowl of porridge right out from under your kids’ spoons.
Well, the fact of the matter is that although you may — may — lose some of
your possessions in bankruptcy, the really important stuff is strictly off-limits
to your creditors. This section spells out what’s yours, what’s potentially at
stake, and what you can do to make sure that your most important posses-
sions remain in your own good hands.
3
Introduction

Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) 
Your Debt
Bankruptcy eliminates most of your debts, but some problems (like taxes,
child support, and school loans) may stick around even if you file. In this sec-
tion, we explore those lingering obligations and explain what you can do to
get the biggest bang for your bankruptcy buck.
Part V: Strategies for a Successful
Bankruptcy
With apologies to Yogi Berra, “It ain’t over ’til it’s over” — and in some cases,
it ain’t even over when it’s over. You have to put in a little effort to get the
most relief from your bankruptcy filing. This section offers oodles of sugges-
tions about how you can make the process run smoothly and effectively, and
how you can avoid some troublesome traps.
Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start
Phew! You made it. You survived bankruptcy, and you’re determined to never
return to the bad old days of debts, delinquencies, and diabolical collection
agents. Thanks to the American tradition of justice, fair play, and sympathy
for the underdog, you have a new lease on your financial life. Here, we work
on restoring your credit and, once and for all, putting all your bad financial
experiences behind you.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Hey, this wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without the tens — and we include
such nuggets as the ten most common questions that we get about bank-
ruptcy and the ten things you can do right now to ease your mind. In fact,
you may want to scan the common questions right now.
Icons Used in This Book
Your road to financial salvation has many twists and turns, and you have to
know when to zig and when to zag. So we include a bunch of eye-catching,
head-bopping iconic reminders to draw attention to particular points or haz-
ards and to warn you in advance of the boring technical stuff.
4
Personal Bankruptcy Law For Dummies, 2nd Edition 

These little bull’s-eyes point out helpful tidbits and strategic moves you or
your lawyer may want to consider.
This icon points out the legal and logistical bombs that may blow up in your
face if you’re not minding your p’s and q’s.
These icons are reminders of points made previously. An awful lot of informa-
tion is included in this book, and we don’t expect you to keep it all in your
head. This is a gentle reminder.
Yikes, some complicated, convoluted information is coming your way! We’ve
made it as easy to understand as possible, but some stuff is just plain mind-
boggling. Dive in at your own peril. We won’t be offended, however, if you
skip ahead. Well, Jim (the lawyer) may be offended. Forget about him.
The rules for what’s called a Chapter 7 bankruptcy — one where you wipe out
all your debts and surrender certain assets — are different from the other
most common consumer bankruptcy, a Chapter 13. When you see this icon,
you know we’re talking only about Chapter 7.
The rules for what’s called a Chapter 13 bankruptcy — one where you pay off
a portion of your debts over time — are different from the other most
common consumer bankruptcy, a Chapter 7. When you see this icon, you
know we’re talking only about Chapter 13.
Legal principles are much easier to understand when you can see how they
apply in the real world. We include plenty of examples and identify them with
this icon.
Where to Go from Here
Relax. As daunting as all this information seems, it’s really not that bad. We
suggest reading the first two chapters from start to finish now, before flipping
to the stuff that’s really worrying you (taming bill collectors, dealing with the
IRS, and so on). In short order, you’ll have a pretty good idea of whether
bankruptcy is right for you.

s bankruptcy the best option for you, or even an option
for you? What happens if you file? What happens if you
don’t? And what’s this new bankruptcy law mean? Do you
need a lawyer? How can you stop the hemorrhaging?
Where do you even start? If you don’t already know the
answers to these questions — and maybe even if you think
you do — start your journey here. Many people begin with
the assumption that even considering bankruptcy is an
admission of failure. Actually, it can be a first step toward
taking responsible control of your financial future. Read
this part to see how bankruptcy is a legitimate tool and 
to understand the implications of exercising — and not
exercising — your right to a fresh start.

Chapter 1
Considering Bankruptcy
In This Chapter
 Understanding the history and tradition of bankruptcy
 Dispelling myths about bankruptcy
 Discovering what you can gain in bankruptcy
 Recognizing what you may lose in bankruptcy
 Knowing the consequences of not filing bankruptcy when you qualify
M
aybe you were socked with an unexpected and uninsured medical
expense, and you didn’t have the savings to cover the bills. Perhaps
you lost your job, and you can no longer juggle your car and mortgage pay-
ments. Maybe you dipped into personal assets in a desperate (and futile) bid
to salvage your business. Perchance your husband split and left you holding
a big bag of joint debts. You likely bought into the easy-credit, instant-gratifi-
cation, shop-till-you-drop mentality encouraged by lenders and retailers and
found yourself mired in financial quicksand. In any case, things got out of
hand and now you’re up to your ears in debt.
Finance companies are warning that if you don’t pay up, and soon, they’re
going to take your home and car. Credit-card firms are threatening to haul
your butt into court. Debt collectors are pursuing you relentlessly. Your
finances are a disaster. Your personal and professional relationships are
strained. You’re losing sleep, and you’re becoming a perfect candidate for
ulcers. Welcome to the club. Millions of Americans are in the same leaky
boat.
Thankfully, you have a way — a perfectly legitimate way — to stop foreclo-
sures and repossessions, put an end to lawsuits, protect your paycheck from
garnishments, get those menacing debt collectors off your back, and regain
control of your life: bankruptcy.
But bankruptcy is shrouded in myth and prejudice. You may have even felt a
twinge of embarrassment buying this book.

If you’re like many folks, the first step on the road to financial recovery is
overcoming your feelings of inadequacy, shame, guilt, and fear of the
unknown.
In this chapter, we encourage you to put myth and prejudice aside and look
calmly at the advantages and disadvantages of bankruptcy. Then, and only
then, can you make a rational decision about whether bankruptcy is the best
choice for you and your loved ones. You have things to gain, and things to
lose, in bankruptcy. This chapter gives you a glimpse of what’s at stake with
bankruptcy in kind of a broad way and serves as a gateway to the rest of the
book.
Viewing Bankruptcy in a 
Historical Context
In the United States, the concept of bankruptcy is unique. Here, bankruptcy is
viewed — legally and perceptually — as a means to an end, and not as “the
end” of a debtor’s financial life. America’s Founding Fathers provided for
bankruptcy right in the Constitution. A series of laws passed (and sometimes
repealed) by Congress during the 1800s shaped the American view of bank-
ruptcy as not only a remedy for creditors, but also as a way to give honest
yet unfortunate debtors financial rebirth. The Bankruptcy Act of 1898 estab-
lished that debtors had a basic right to financial relief without creditor con-
sent or court permission. American bankruptcy laws have come to be
recognized as far more compassionate and much less punitive to debtors
than the laws of other countries.
Like much of American law, the country’s bankruptcy statutes reflect the con-
stant tension between the competing interests of debtors and creditors.
Think of it as a perpetual tug of war, with each side striving mightily but
never pulling their opponent all the way over the line. To this day, the bal-
ance of influence between creditors and debtors is in an ever-present state of
flux. Sometimes debtors have the upper hand. Other times, creditors get the
edge. At the moment, thanks to a new law that took effect in October 2005,
creditors are holding the trump card.
The constant, however, is that Americans have always been (and remain)
entitled to a fresh start. The obstacles that you must clear to obtain this fresh
start are not constant; they’re always changing.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture

Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy’s roots
The word bankruptcy evolved from an Italian
phrase banca ratta that means “broken bench
or table.” In medieval times, when a merchant
failed to pay his debts, creditors would ceremo-
niously break the bench or table from which he
conducted his business. The forgiveness of
debts, on the other hand, has biblical roots.
Consider the Old Testament: “At the end of every
seven years, you are to cancel the debts of
those who owe you money. This is how it is
done. Everyone who has lent money to his
neighbor is to cancel the debt: he must not try to
collect the money: the Lord himself has declared
the debt canceled.” (Deuteronomy 15: 1–2).
Debt forgiveness also is a prominent New
Testament theme. In Matthew 18:21–27, Jesus
relates the story of a servant who was indebted
to his master. The master ordered the servant
and his entire family into slavery but, upon
reconsideration, he forgave the debt. Jesus
used the parable to explain the virtue of debt
forgiveness. (On the other hand, the apostle
Paul admonishes debt in Romans 13:8, “Render
therefore to all their dues . . . owe no man any
thing.” So maybe we can’t afford to get too
pious here.)
In any case, throughout history, creditors have
not exactly displayed an attitude of Judeo-
Christian charity toward debtors. Neither have
governments.
The early Romans hacked up and divided the
bodies of people who didn’t pay their debts. In
early England, people who were in over their
heads financially were tossed in dungeons. The
initial bankruptcy law, passed in 1542 during the
reign of Henry VIII (the guy who kept beheading
his wives), viewed debtors as quasi criminals
but, for the first time, provided remedies other
than imprisonment or mutilation.
Apparently, creditors finally realized that killing,
maiming, or imprisoning debtors only ensured
that they’d never get their money and that even
if the debtor survived, he’d never be able to sup-
port himself and his family or become a pro-
ductive member of society.
During the more enlightened reign of Queen
Elizabeth I, a comprehensive bankruptcy law
was passed (one that remained in effect for
more than a century). The aim of the 1570 bank-
ruptcy law was most certainly not to grant relief
to debtors. Rather, it was designed to help cred-
itors. It applied only to merchants (ordinary
debtors still were imprisoned) and essentially
laid out procedures by which a bankruptcy
commissioner could seize the debtor’s assets,
sell them, and divide the proceeds among cred-
itors. Debtors who did not cooperate had one of
their ears lopped off.
The very idea of a bankruptcy law aiding
debtors or forgiving debts remained a some-
what unimaginable concept until 1705, when
Parliament enacted the first law that enabled a
person to wipe out unpaid financial obligations.
However, the terms were rather harsh: Consent
of the creditor was required, and anyone who
fraudulently sought bankruptcy relief faced the
death penalty.
Before the United States won its independence,
the various colonies handled bankruptcy their
own respective ways, and little uniformity
existed from colony to colony — except for the
fact that settlers generally maintained the
British tradition of jailing debtors (which
extended to one of the British Empire’s greatest
literary stars, Charles Dickens.). In fact, Robert
Morris, known as the “financier of the American
revolution” and a signer of the Declaration of
Independence, spent three years in debtors’
prison (and six years in the United States
Senate). Supreme Court Justice James Wilson
fled Pennsylvania to avoid a similar fate.

Modern-day bankruptcy is rooted in the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, a federal
law that was produced after more than ten years of careful study by judges
and scholars. More recently, creditors and their lobbyists essentially rewrote
what was a pretty well reasoned and fair law in their own image. The result
was the “Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of
2005” — often known as the Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco, or BARF. It’s
not good for consumers. It’s not good for the economy. It flies in the face of
the risk-reward principles at the core of capitalism. And, in the long run, it’s
probably not all that good for the credit industry, which wrote it.
So how did a one-sided, ill-considered bucket of BARF happen to pass both
houses of Congress as well as presidential scrutiny?
Some cynics think the eight-year lobbying campaign by the credit-card indus-
try and the $100 million spent on campaign contributions may have had
something to do with it. Some speculate that lawmakers, blinded by cam-
paign contributions and sound-bite moralizing about personal responsibility
(we are, by the way, all for personal responsibility — both for borrowers and
lenders), simply didn’t pay a whole lot of attention to the fine print in an
incredibly complex amendment that’s about the size of a metropolitan tele-
phone book.
How these provisions will be implemented, applied and interpreted remains a
mystery, and it will take years and years of cases and judicial opinions to sort
it out. The simple fact of the matter is that neither we, your lawyer, nor even
your local bankruptcy judge know for sure how or when the higher courts
will decipher all this stuff and figure out how to apply it to circumstances
never imagined by the people who wrote and voted for this bill.
Debunking Bankruptcy Myths
Bankruptcy is an economic decision, not a morality play, and you needn’t be
deceived into viewing it as anything else. The following sections look at some
of the usual red herrings that are cast about by the credit industry.
People who go bankrupt are 
sleazy deadbeats
People file for bankruptcy because they’re in debt. The more debt there is,
the more bankruptcies there are. Well, duh! It really is that simple.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture

Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy
American bankruptcy
Our forefathers had radical ideas when it came
to bankruptcy.
The founders of this country foresaw the possi-
bility that honest people might suffer severe
economic misfortune or make poor choices
(Thomas Jefferson, certainly one of the most
productive and accomplished individuals in the
history of the world, was perpetually on the
brink of bankruptcy during his later years), and
had the wisdom to provide for bankruptcy in the
U.S. Constitution.
After the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the
framers of the Constitution added a bankruptcy
clause empowering Congress to pass uniform
bankruptcy laws to prevent some states from
establishing debtors’ havens. In 1800 — 11
years after the ratification of the Constitution —
Congress passed (by a single vote) a national
bankruptcy law that enabled debtors to wipe
out unpaid debts. But the provision was
repealed three years later because of creditor
complaints. Consequently, states began pass-
ing their own bankruptcy laws, a practice that
was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court.
By 1833, the federal government abolished
debtors’ prisons. Honest debtors would no
longer be incarcerated. But bankruptcy was still
viewed as a remedy for creditors, not debtors.
The tide began to shift when Congress, spurred
by the powerful oratory of Daniel Webster,
passed the Bankruptcy Act of 1841, a seminal
event that established clearly that bankruptcy
law was for debtors and for creditors. For the
first time in history, the advocates for debtors
had prevailed over the interests of creditors.
The victory, however, was short-lived. Only
three years later, creditors succeeded in having
the law withdrawn. A similar choreography
occurred just after the Civil War: Congress
passed the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, which again
enabled debtors to wipe out their debts. Eleven
years later, creditors got it repealed. The thresh-
old problem was this: Debt elimination was
viewed as a privilege, dependent on creditor
consent or court permission, not a fundamental
right.
In the late 1890s, a revolutionary and uniquely
American idea emerged — namely, that bank-
ruptcy relief needed to be available to an honest
person without consent or permission from
others. This concept, which has come to be
known as the unconditional discharge, was
carved into the Bankruptcy Act of 1898.
Regardless of the long history and legal tradi-
tion underlying the unconditional discharge,
creditors never cease trying to turn the clock
back to the days when your bankruptcy relief
required their permission.
Whenever the political climate appears favor-
able, creditors predictably scamper to Congress,
whine about their losses, and claim that 
the “crisis” of “out-of-control” bankruptcies
threatens to undermine the whole of Western
civilization.
And therein lies the roots of BARF!
(See Charles Jordan Tabb, The History of the
Bankruptcy Laws in the United States, American
Bankruptcy Institute Law Review, Vol. 3:5, 1995.)

The credit industry stereotypes folks who file bankruptcy as worthless dead-
beats taking advantage of a loophole-ridden legal system to dump their moral
obligations on the backs of the rest of us. This stereotype is false, discrimina-
tory, and manifestly unfair. Sure, bankruptcies have increased dramatically
along with consumer debt, although the number of bankruptcies per $100
million on consumer debt has remained remarkably constant. From the 1970s
to the 1980s, filings virtually doubled. The pace continued to increase in the
1990s, with bankruptcy filings setting new records year after year, even with a
seemingly robust economy and near full employment. In fact, by the mid-
1990s, bankruptcy filings, on a per capita basis, were running some eight
times ahead of those of the Great Depression. About 1 out of every 75 house-
holds in America have a member who has filed bankruptcy.
And who are these people filing for bankruptcy? Chances are they’re your
neighbors, regardless of what neighborhood you live in. Bankruptcy is an
equal opportunity phenomenon that strikes every socioeconomic bracket.
The fastest growing group of bankruptcy filers are older Americans. More
than half of those 65 and older are forced into bankruptcy by medical debts.
Also, more families with children, single mothers, and single fathers are being
driven into bankruptcy — the presence of children in a household triples the
odds that the head of the household will end up in bankruptcy.
In any case, the image of the sleazy, deadbeat bankruptcy filer is a phantom
and a scapegoat for irresponsible lending. The bankruptcy filer can be more
accurately described as an ordinary, honest, hardworking, middle-class con-
sumer who fell for aggressive and sophisticated credit marketing techniques,
lost control, and unwittingly surrendered his financial soul to the devil that is
debt.
Bankruptcy is the easy way out 
for folks who can pay their bills
Creditors have been making this claim since the 1800s, and it’s as demonstra-
bly wrong today as it was back then.
In recent years, the credit industry funded several studies — a handy
euphemism for propaganda, the more accurate description — that suppos-
edly support their argument that people are skipping to bankruptcy court to
skip out of their obligations. Every one of these self-serving reports has been
debunked by independent sources — every single one. Several of these stud-
ies were even discredited by two financial arms of Congress, the General
Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Bankruptcy isn’t the cause of debt, but rather is the result. And it isn’t the
disease, but rather is the cure. Restricting access to bankruptcy court won’t
solve the problem of debt any more than closing the hospitals will cure a
plague.
Bankruptcy threatens the ethical 
foundations of our society
Gee, you’d think that bankruptcy was the greatest threat to apple pie and
motherhood since Elvis Presley and bell-bottom jeans!
Credit-card companies furiously push plastic on virtually anyone willing to
take it. At present, more than one billion credit cards are in circulation —
that’s about a dozen for every household in America. Lenders mail out bil-
lions of credit-card solicitations every year. Low- and moderate-income
households, high school students, and the mentally disabled — or, in their
vernacular, “emerging markets” — are popular targets of lenders.
According to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, con-
sumers between the ages of 18 and 25 are one of the largest growing seg-
ments (next to senior citizens) of bankruptcy filers — students and other
young people who lack the maturity and resources to handle debt.
Anyone with a brain can figure out that extending credit to folks with no
income, no assets, and no track record is kind of dumb (not to mention
morally questionable). But creditors are more than willing to ignore the dan-
gers of tomorrow so that they can reap exorbitant interest rates today.
They’re counting on — literally banking on — your ignorance of the situation.
They encourage robbing Peter to pay Paul by using credit-card advances to
pay off credit-card bills. They convince many middle-class consumers to
bleed all the equity out of their homes through aggressively marketed home-
equity loans — with much of it going to finance consumable products (mall
junk) rather than the homestead of the American Dream. That hundreds of
solid, middle-class folks find themselves in bankruptcy court isn’t surprising.
But why, in the face of increasing credit-card losses, does the credit industry
continue dispensing credit with utterly reckless abandon? The answer is
simple: Because it’s profitable . . . extremely profitable. Since 1997, bank-
ruptcy filings have increased 17 percent, while credit-card profits have
soared 163 percent!
15
Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy

Honest folks pay a “tax” to support 
those who are bankrupt
That honest taxpayers are supporting people who are bankrupt is nothing
short of an outright, bald-faced lie. The theory, trumpeted in press releases,
is that hundreds of thousands of Americans routinely ignore their obliga-
tions, intentionally or recklessly drive up their debts, and then declare them-
selves insolvent, stiffing creditors, and ultimately, every God-fearing,
bill-paying, hard-working, patriotic American.
Creditors note that they write off about $40 billion in debts annually, which
works out to about $400 to $500 for every American household. Thus, the
reasoning goes, if access to bankruptcy were restricted, the credit industry
wouldn’t suffer losses that it must pass along to consumers. So, they say,
BARF is good for consumers.
They’re not saying, take note, that they’ll pass along any savings to their 
customers, and historically that has not been their practice. Besides, do you
really believe that the credit industry paid politicians tens of millions of 
dollars to enact BARF in order to save you money? Not likely.
Understanding What You Can 
Gain Through Bankruptcy
If you have no way of paying your bills, you certainly need to consider bank-
ruptcy. If you have an income but cannot repay your debts in full within three
years while maintaining a reasonable standard of living, bankruptcy may be a
wise option. (Chapter 2 can help you calculate your potential to pay your
debts based on current income and expenses.)
16
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
It’s enough to make you BARF
A five-year study published in the medical
policy journal Health Affairs in February 2005
found that between 1981 and 2001, medical-
related bankruptcies increased by 2,200 
percent — six times the increase in the number
of all bankruptcies during the same period. And
most of the medical filers were not the unin-
sured poor, but middle-class folks with health
insurance. According to the study, it’s not lack
of insurance that wipes people out; it’s copay-
ments, deductibles, and uncovered services.

Bankruptcy isn’t the solution when your motive is anything other than rea-
sonable relief from your debts. The U.S. Bankruptcy Code was established to
assist honest debtors, not to provide a haven for chiselers and charlatans. If
your aim is to jerk some creditor around, weasel out of debts you can easily
pay, evade child support, or generally just stiff someone, bankruptcy is the
wrong route. Bankruptcy should not be used for vengeance or as a stopgap
measure. It should not be used as a ploy or a bargaining chip. You should not
file bankruptcy unless you’re serious about following through.
Bankruptcy can
 Halt almost every kind of lawsuit.
 Prevent garnishment of any wages you earn after filing.
 Stop most evictions if bankruptcy is filed before a state court enters a
judgment for possession.
 Avert repossessions.
 Stop foreclosures.
 Prevent your driver’s license from being yanked for unpaid fines or judg-
ments. (The stay doesn’t prevent revocation or suspension of your
driver’s license for failing to pay court-ordered support.)
 Bring IRS seizures to a skidding stop.
Bankruptcy generally won’t prevent
 Criminal prosecutions
 Proceedings against someone who cosigned your loan, unless you file a
“Chapter 13” repayment plan and propose paying the loan in full (see
Chapter 4)
 Contempt of court hearings
 Actions to collect back child support or alimony, unless you file Chapter
13 and propose to pay that obligation off during the life of your plan (see
Chapter 17)
 Governmental regulatory proceedings
In recent years, some self-proclaimed “mortgage consultants” and “foreclo-
sure service” outfits have made a business out of essentially tricking their
clients into filing bankruptcy. These con artists exploit the bankruptcy laws
to delay foreclosure, collect rents from the property during the delay, and
then head for the hills. In the end, unsuspecting clients usually lose their
homes and wind up with a bankruptcy on their records without realizing
they’d even filed for bankruptcy. Bottom line: Discuss your options with an
experienced bankruptcy attorney, not some fly-by-night flimflam operation.
See Chapter 3 for tips on finding a good lawyer.

Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy

Stopping creditors in their tracks
The moment that you file a bankruptcy petition, a legal shield called the 
automatic stay kicks in, prohibiting creditors from contacting you, suing you,
repossessing your property, or garnishing your wages.
After you file, a creditor can ask for permission to proceed with a reposses-
sion or foreclosure. But the creditor must obtain permission in advance, and
the bankruptcy court judge may very well turn them down, if you propose a
reasonable plan for paying that particular debt. (The following sections cover
filing bankruptcy to eliminate some bills and pay others.)
Whenever a creditor is foolish enough to ignore the automatic stay, he’ll have
a federal judge on his back and may well get zapped with a fine and an order
to pay your attorney fees.
Wiping out most of your debts
Bankruptcy wipes out or discharges most debts. Credit cards, medical bills,
phone charges, loans, and judgments all are usually dischargeable. However,
some obligations generally are not eliminated in bankruptcy, and these
nondischargeable debts include
 Student loans (see Chapter 18)
 Alimony and child support (see Chapter 17)
 Damages for a personal injury you caused while driving illegally under
the influence of drugs or alcohol (see Chapter 16)
 Debts from fraud (see Chapters 11 and 16)
 Financial obligations imposed as part of a criminal conviction (see
Chapter 16)
 Taxes arising during the past three years (see Chapter 15)
Catching up on back mortgage 
and car payments
Sometimes, even dischargeable debts may continue to haunt you when they
are tied to one of your essential possessions. For example, you can wipe out
loans secured by your home or car, but the creditor can still foreclose on
your house or repossess your vehicle if you don’t pay.
18
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (one where you pay what you can toward your
debts and the remainder is forgiven), you can propose a partial repayment
plan to avoid foreclosure and make up back mortgage payments over a five-
year span. You can prevent repossession of your car by catching up on back
payments of the life of the plan. In some situations, you have to pay only
what the vehicle is worth — rather than the whole loan balance (see
Chapters 11 and 12).
Filing bankruptcy to pay some debts 
over time
Although some debts are not dischargeable, filing a Chapter 13 reorganiza-
tion enables you to pay debts such as support obligations or back taxes over
a five-year period and protects you from being hassled while you’re paying
down the balances. You can also gradually catch up on missed mortgage 
payments. In the meantime, most of your other debts are eliminated while
you just pay for current expenses and keep current on future house and car
payments.
Using bankruptcy to pay all your debts
Sometimes filing bankruptcy actually provides a way of paying all your debts
rather than escaping them.
If the value of your property is sufficient to pay all your debts if only you 
had enough time to sell your assets, bankruptcy can be used to hold aggres-
sive lenders at bay until your property is sold for the benefit of all your 
creditors — and possibly producing a surplus for you.
Here’s how it works. Say, for example, that you own investment property
worth $150,000, on which you have a mortgage of $100,000, and that you have
other debts totaling $25,000.
If you can sell the property, you can pay off the mortgage and other debts
and still have something left over for yourself. But if the mortgageholder fore-
closes, neither you nor your creditors are likely to receive a cent. Although
the property is put up for public auction in a foreclosure, bidders rarely show
up, and the only bidder typically is the mortgageholder, which merely bids
the amount that’s owed on the mortgage. In other words, the mortgage com-
pany ends up owning the property without paying any cash. Filing bankruptcy
interrupts the foreclosure so that the property can be sold for everyone’s ben-
efit. See Chapter 12 for more on how foreclosures work and how you can actu-
ally use the bankruptcy process to save your home.

Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy

Knowing What You Can Lose 
in Bankruptcy
Although bankruptcy may be that miracle cure you sought for your financial
woes, you may encounter some unpleasant side effects. The disadvantages of
filing bankruptcy are
 You can lose assets. Depending on how much your home is worth and
where you live, it is possible, but unlikely, that you’ll lose it by filing
bankruptcy. (If you’re really worried about what will happen to your
stuff, check out Part III, especially Chapter 10.) In most bankruptcies,
debtors don’t have to give up any of their belongings, but . . .
 Bankruptcy is a matter of public record. As more and more records are
stored on computers and accessible on the Internet, searching that data
becomes easier and easier for anyone who’s interested. In other words,
if your nosey neighbor wants to know whether you filed bankruptcy,
how much you owe, and who you owe it to, the information may be just
a few mouse clicks away,
 Bankruptcy affects your credit rating. Bankruptcy may have a negative
effect on your credit rating, but that fact may well fall into the “So
what?” category for you. Even with a bankruptcy on your record, your
odds of obtaining credit are very good. With a little work and persever-
ance, you can reestablish credit almost immediately. Some credit-card
companies actually target folks right after bankruptcy because they
know that these people are free of all their existing debts and probably
won’t be eligible to file another bankruptcy any time soon. For a few
years after bankruptcy, you may have to pay higher interest rates on
20
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
Noncitizens of the U.S. of A.
You don’t even have to be an American citizen to
qualify for a fresh start. Neither citizenship nor
even formal resident-alien status is required. As
long as you have property or a business in the
U.S., you’re eligible for bankruptcy relief. But
courts disagree on just what “property in the
United States” constitutes, and some have
rejected attempts by foreigners to create eligi-
bility by simply obtaining a U. S. mailbox or
establishing a nominal bank account. Others
take a more liberal view.
For example, Ernestine didn’t live, work, or do
any business in the United States, but she had a
few hundred bucks in a bank account. The court
said Ernestine was eligible to file bankruptcy in
the United States — expressing bewilderment
as to why American credit-card companies
would offer massive amounts of credit to a for-
eigner with no job and $522 to her name.

new credit, but this result will ease over time, even if your credit report
still shows a bankruptcy. So, don’t pay too much attention to the horror
stories bill collectors tell you about the disastrous effect bankruptcy has
your credit. (In Chapter 21, we walk you through rebuilding your credit
after bankruptcy.)
 Friends and relatives can be forced to give back money or property.
If you repaid loans to friends or relatives or gave them anything within
the past year, they can be forced to repay a trustee the money they
received, if you don’t know what to watch out for. (We tell you what to
watch out for in Chapter 19.) You can usually avoid these kinds of prob-
lems by carefully timing your bankruptcy filing.
 Bankruptcy can strain relations with loved ones, especially parents
who were raised in a different era. (In Chapter 2, we give you some
pointers on easing the strain.)
 A stigma may still be attached to filing bankruptcy. This drawback is
especially true in small communities, but is much less likely to be a
problem in cities, where newspapers rarely bother printing the names of
nonbusiness bankruptcies.
 Bankruptcy may cause more problems than it solves when you’ve
transferred assets to keep them away from creditors. (You can find out
more about this problem in Chapter 19.)
 You can suffer some discrimination. Although governmental agencies
and employers aren’t supposed to discriminate against you for filing
bankruptcy, they may still do so in a roundabout way. Prospective
employers may also refuse to hire you (see Chapter 25 for more on
employment discrimination).
Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy isn’t for everyone, and sometimes better solutions are available.
We explain them in Chapter 7. If it appears that the negatives outweigh the
positives, another route may be your best choice. Depending on your situa-
tion, the best alternative may be
 Selling assets to pay debts in full
 Negotiating with creditors to reduce your debts to a manageable level
 Restructuring your home mortgage
 Taking out a home-equity loan
 Doing nothing at all if you have nothing, expect to acquire nothing, and
don’t care about your present or future credit rating
21
Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy

In any event, you need to weigh your decision on a simple, rational scale. Ask
yourself whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Many people, ravaged
by guilt and shame, think they need to fully exhaust every alternative before
considering bankruptcy, including
 Making payments that never reduce the principal balance owed
 Taking out second mortgages to pay credit-card debts
 Borrowing against pensions
 Withdrawing funds from retirement accounts
 Obtaining loans from friends and relatives
 Taking second jobs
You must think seriously about the strain your financial distress places on
your health, marriage, and family. Granted, bankruptcy is a very serious step
that you shouldn’t take lightly, but that doesn’t mean you have to wait until
you’ve lost everything. Think of it in these terms: If you have some blocked
arteries, it just may be smarter to have bypass surgery before you have a
heart attack. The same is true of bankruptcy. Think of bankruptcy as preven-
tative medicine.
Introducing the Different Types 
of Personal Bankruptcy
Consumer bankruptcies are covered mainly under two parts of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code:
 Chapter 7 liquidation, which enables you to eliminate most of your
debts but may require you to forfeit some of your assets for distribution
to creditors.
 Chapter 13 reorganization, which enables you to pay off all or a por-
tion of your debts during a three- to five-year time span but doesn’t
require you to forfeit any of your belongings or assets to pay unsecured
debts (those that are not secured by property, such as your car or
another valuable asset). See Chapter 11 for more on the difference
between secured and unsecured debts.
Likewise, other special kinds of bankruptcy exist. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is
available to individuals but primarily is used for large business reorganiza-
tions. Chapter 12 bankruptcy, which is similar to Chapter 13 bankruptcy,
addresses the unique problems faced by family farmers and family fishermen.
As a practical matter, almost all consumer cases are covered under Chapter 7
or Chapter 13 of the code.
22
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Liquidations (Chapter 7)
Chapter 7, commonly referred to as straight bankruptcy, is often what people
mean or think of when they use or hear the term generically.
In its simplest form, Chapter 7 wipes out most of your debts and, in return,
you may have to surrender some of your property. Chapter 7 doesn’t include
a repayment plan. Your debts are simply eliminated forever. If you buy a lot-
tery ticket the day after filing and hit the jackpot, yippee! for you and tough
beans for your creditors. You obviously can voluntarily pay back your credi-
tors if you suddenly strike it rich, but, legally, you don’t owe a dime after your
debt is discharged. Most property you receive after filing Chapter 7 doesn’t
become part of your bankruptcy, but there are a few exceptions. Income tax
refunds for prebankruptcy tax years go to pay your debts as well as divorce
property awards, inheritances, and life insurance that you become entitled to
receive within 180 days of bankruptcy. See Chapter 10 on what assets are at
risk.
Theoretically, a debtor’s assets can be seized and sold for the benefit of cred-
itors. All nonexempt assets owned on the petition date are fair game. They
can be sold, with the proceeds distributed to your creditors. But in practice,
96 percent of consumer bankruptcies are no-asset cases, meaning that no
property is taken away from the debtor because it’s all exempt or worth so
little that it’s not worth the trouble.
In order to qualify for Chapter 7, if you earn more than the median income for
your state, you’ll have to pass a new Means Test (see Chapter 5) where you
show that you don’t have enough income to pay a significant portion of your
debts. Although the test is ungodly complicated, when all is said and done,
just about everyone can pass. The toughest part is just assembling the infor-
mation you have to provide. You can find helpful worksheets in Chapter 2.
Consumer reorganizations (Chapter 13)
Chapter 13 involves a repayment plan in which you pay all or part of your
debts during a three- to five-year period. In a Chapter 13, you propose a debt
repayment plan that requires court approval and thereafter keeps creditors
at bay as long as you keep making payments. This plan can be a great relief,
when you’re able to establish and live within the confines of a budget.
A budget plan that demands frugality to the point of misery is doomed to fail
(“Frugality is misery in disguise,” observed Pubilius Syrus some 2,000 years
ago). One that is reasonable has a good chance of succeeding. The operative
word, however, is reasonable. See Chapters 2 and 22 for more on creating and
living within a budget.
23
Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy

Every Chapter 13 plan must pass two tests:
 The best-interest test, which mandates that unsecured creditors be paid
at least as much as they would receive if you filed a Chapter 7 instead of
a Chapter 13.
 The best-efforts test, which requires that you pay all your disposable
income (the amount left over after paying reasonable living expenses) to
the trustee for at least the first 36 months of your plan. If your monthly
income is more than the median for your state, allowable expenses will
be based on Internal Revenue Collection Financial Standards, and the
plan must run for five years. Otherwise, the amount of your payment will
be based on your actual expenses, so long as they are reasonable.
When you’re done, you’re done. Most creditors have gotten all they’re going
to get. Life goes on. See Chapter 4 to see what type of bankruptcy is best 
for you.
Weighing the Consequences 
of Not Filing Bankruptcy
In the same way that filing bankruptcy can have negative consequences, not
filing can also have negative consequences. If you’re eligible for bankruptcy,
but opt against filing, creditors have a number of options they can pursue,
depending on whether a particular debt is secured by your property.
Claims secured by your car
If your car secures a debt, the creditor can repossess the vehicle and sell it to
cover the loan. The proceeds of a repossession sale usually aren’t enough to
pay the debt, so you’ll lose the car and still have to pay the balance that you
owe on it — the worst of both worlds.
Although the law requires a creditor to sell a car in a “commercially reason-
able” manner, that doesn’t necessarily mean that the creditor will receive
nearly as much as you can by selling it yourself. Before allowing reposses-
sion, you may want to try selling the vehicle. Your chances of getting more
money for the car are greater than the finance company’s. See Chapter 11 for
more on how bankruptcy can affect your car. If you and your lawyer agree
that it’s best to get rid of the car because you just can’t afford it, you can vol-
untarily surrender it to the lender rather than wait for them to repossess it.
Despite what people may tell you, your credit report will not look that much
better, but at least you’ll avoid the hassle of finding your car gone when you
come out of the supermarket, or the embarrassment of a tow truck showing
up at your house.
24
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Claims secured by your home
Mortgage companies can’t simply boot you out of your home and onto your
derrière if you miss a few payments. They must first go through a foreclosure
procedure to extinguish your ownership rights. Although not all foreclosures
involve court proceedings, all do take time — at least three months in most
cases and frequently much longer. You can continue to live on the property
until the foreclosure is completed. Chapter 12 has more on the workings of
foreclosures.
Student loans
Government agencies can garnish (siphon off) up to 10 percent of your dis-
posable income without going to court. A garnishment is almost like a with-
holding tax — the money is gone from your paycheck before you ever see it.
You also need to be aware that Congress canceled state statutes of limita-
tions on student loans. In other words, you can’t just wait it out. You must
deal with student loans. They won’t disappear on their own. See Chapter 18
for more on student loans.
Support obligations
Although debtors’ prisons are officially a thing of the past, a divorce court
can still send you to jail for neglecting your support obligations, and some
states have programs to revoke professional licenses — such as licenses for
practical nurses or accountants or cosmetologists — of people who haven’t
kept up with their support. Chapter 17 covers support obligations.
Fines and restitution
If you’ve been ordered to pay a fine or make restitution in connection with a
criminal proceeding and don’t pay, accommodations at the local jail may await
you. Don’t tempt the judge, because some of them don’t need much tempting
to have you hauled off in handcuffs. See Chapter 16 for more on fines.
Taxes
The IRS has truly scary powers to seize your bank account, pension, real
property, or even the shirt off your back. State taxing authorities also have
similar special powers. In addition, your town or city, student loan creditors,
or your ex-spouse or kids may be able to grab your tax refund whenever you
owe alimony or support. Chapters 9 and 15 cover taxes.
25
Chapter 1: Considering Bankruptcy

Lawsuits
Creditors with other types of claims can’t do much without first suing you
and obtaining a judgment. To do this, they must serve you with legal docu-
ments and give you a chance to dispute the debt in court. If you don’t
respond, a default judgment can be entered against you. That means the
ruling goes against you even though you never presented your case.
Using the Statute of Limitations
Most debts — student loans being the most notable exception — eventually
evaporate simply through the passage of time. In most cases, the statute of
limitations (the time period within which an action must be commenced) is
six years or less. But whenever a judgment has been entered against you, it
can be as long as 20 years.
Sometimes the statute of limitations (usually ten years) can make federal
taxes disappear. See Chapter 9.
The trick is figuring out when the statute of limitations clock begins ticking.
Sometimes, just making partial payments or acknowledging a debt can start
the time running all over again. And you sure don’t want that to happen.

emoralizing debt can seem like a perpetual storm cloud hovering over
your days and putting a damper on all life’s pleasures. As bleak as your
outlook may seem, the forecast really isn’t that dismal. A ray of sunshine is
striving to break through those clouds, and we’re going to help you find it.
Remember, however, that maintaining a positive, can-do attitude is essential.
Although considering personal bankruptcy is no time for self-pity, under-
standing that you’re not a loser, you’re not alone, and that your predicament
is symptomatic of a new culture that emerged during the last half-century is
definitely important.
Realizing You’re Not Alone
If you’re like most debtors, you probably feel as if you’ve been hemorrhaging
green stuff for so long that your financial blood vessels are bone-dry. And
you’re probably down on yourself in a big way. Although you must accept
responsibility for your own mistakes — and bear the cross even when your
predicament is just the result of rotten luck — you’re also probably riding a
crazy but predictable wave that has engulfed several million other Americans.
Lenders perpetually make pitches for more spending and more borrowing,
which on the credibility scale is somewhere up there with the Boston stran-
gler promoting the Heimlich maneuver. Even political institutions have signed

on to the consumerism fad. National leaders tell us in times of economic
downturn that spending more and more is our patriotic duty, further extend-
ing our debt load. What’s good for the credit-card companies, apparently, is
good for America — at least in the eyes of consumer lenders.
Odds are you’ve consciously (or subconsciously) swallowed this bait hook,
line, and sinker. And odds are you’ve already paid the piper in the currency of
stress and anxiety. It doesn’t take a mind reader to predict that you (and
others in your situation) are probably
 Fighting with your spouse over money
 Watching in helpless horror as more and more and more of your
monthly income falls down the debt drain
 Sweating even the minimum payments on your credit cards
 Neglecting routine and preventive medical and dental care because you
can’t pay the doctor’s bill, and even the copay seems daunting
 Taking advances on one credit card to cover payments on another — the
very definition of robbing Peter to pay Paul
 Dodging calls from creditors and pretending to be someone else when
they call
 Using your credit card for small purchases and then buying more things
you don’t need because you’re embarrassed to go into a drugstore and
charge only a bottle of aspirin
 Saving those unsolicited cash advance checks from lenders, just in case
 Waking up in the middle of the night worrying about money
Welcome to the club — a really big club. Now that you’re a member, you have
only one thing to do: Clear your head and put a tourniquet on your wound
this instant. True, the problem may not be entirely of your making. It is, how-
ever, entirely your responsibility to get out of trouble, so go for it! You need
to make a rational determination about what you ought to do and how you
ought to do it.
Preventing Further Damage Now
Imagining things being much bleaker than they seem right now is probably
difficult, but if you’re on the brink of bankruptcy, you need to be extremely
careful; otherwise, you’ll only muck up your situation.
28
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Until you’ve met with a bankruptcy lawyer and know just where you stand,
do not

loans from friends or relatives.
 Make any payments on debts to friends, business partners, or 
relatives.
 Provide information about your income or expenses to any credit
counseling or debt consolidation outfit.
 Call or write to any creditor who does not already know how to con-
tact you.
 Get married — or divorced.
 Sell any valuable assets.
 Make any gifts (other than charitable contributions that you normally
make) or transfer property in an attempt to keep those assets away
from creditors.
 Ignore lawsuits.
 Give any creditor a postdated check.
 Reveal to a creditor who holds the title to your car that you’re consid-
ering bankruptcy.
 Agree to pay joint debts if you’re in the middle of a divorce matter.
 File any past-due income tax returns. (However, have them prepared
and ready to file.)
 Make any unusual or large contributions to a pension fund.
 Make any withdrawals from your pension.
 Move out of your homestead or enter into a contract to sell it.
 Allow a foreclosure sale to occur or give a creditor a deed in lieu of
foreclosure.
 Leave any money on deposit in an institution where you owe money.
 Allow health insurance to lapse.
 Voluntarily leave your job.
Watch out for credit-card arbitration proceedings.

Chapter 2: Stopping the Bleeding

Some credit-card companies have partnered with an outfit called the
“National Arbitration Forum.” It is nothing more than a kangaroo court, estab-
lished so that creditors can get stealth judgments — often on bogus claims —
against consumers without the hassle of going through a real court with a
real judge.
How do they get away with this? They’re sneaky. Along with all the other junk
they stick in the envelopes with their monthly statements is often an official
and binding notice that collections issued will be resolved through arbitration,
not litigation. Those sessions will probably not take place anywhere conve-
nient to you — like your local courthouse. Rather, they’ll occur in some other
location, possibly far from your home.
It usually starts with a legalistic notice that arbitration proceedings have
been started against you, and that if you do not respond, an award may be
turned into a real court judgment against you. They’re counting on you not
responding, of course, and most folks don’t. And then you’re screwed.
So if you receive one of these notices, don’t ignore it if you have any reason
at all to question the amount of the claim against you. Study the instructions
that come with the notice and force them to at least prove that you owe them
money.
Throughout this book, we show you how these and other seemingly innocent
actions can complicate your bankruptcy and your life. If you’ve already done
some of the don’ts, don’t despair. Just make sure to tell your lawyer, who may
be able to fix things.
Comparing Your Income 
with Your Spending
When you know what not to do (see the preceding section), you can focus on
what you can do to improve your situation. And the first thing to do is make
an honest, objective, unemotional assessment of what you have, what you
owe, and what you can do to balance the scales.
Figuring out where you stand or where you’re going without knowing just
how much you make and spend is tough. Taking the time to complete the two
worksheets outlined in Tables 2-1 and 2-2 helps you
 Provide insight into whether you can solve your problems without 
bankruptcy
30
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

 Assemble the information your lawyer needs to file bankruptcy
 Establish a budget for the future so you don’t get into financial trouble
again
Focusing on how much income you have
Table 2-1 helps you calculate the first half of the financial equation — your
monthly income.
Focusing on monthly income and expenses would be wise, so you may have
to prorate some figures. Prorating means, for example, that when you’re paid
every two weeks, you double the amount of your paycheck. Whenever you
receive an annual bonus, divide it by 12.
Several of the sources to which you can look for this information are
 Your paycheck
 Last year’s income tax return
 Records of any alimony you receive (not the amount you’re supposed to
get, but the actual amount you received)

Coming to grips with where 
your money goes
Chances are, you don’t really know where all your money goes. It probably
seems like you just never have enough, despite living a rather modest
lifestyle.
We suggest that you carry around a little notebook so that you can record
every expenditure that you make for a month. You say you dropped $10 in the
collection basket at church? Write it down. Maybe you picked up a box of
cookies at the convenience store . . . make a note. Even if it’s only a cup of
coffee or a soda, record it. Sure, it sounds like a hassle — and it is, but that’s
the point. The pain of having to write down every expenditure makes you
less likely to spend the money. It just becomes more trouble than it’s worth.
32
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Keeping track of all your expenditures enables you to do the following:
 Prepare a realistic budget
 Lay the groundwork for bringing your spending under control, regard-
less of whether you end up filing bankruptcy
 Make a more informed decision about whether bankruptcy is the best
solution
 Intelligently weigh pros and cons of a Chapter 7 liquidation versus a
Chapter 13 reorganization
 Provide a ready record of some of the information necessary to com-
plete bankruptcy papers, if you decide to go that route
Be sure to record expenses that are not monthly and tend to fall into the out-
of-sight-out-of-mind category. Insurance, real property taxes, income taxes
not withheld from wages, vacation expenses, tuition, and Christmas spending
are a few examples. When you pay car insurance every six months, divide the
amount of this payment by six. When you pay some bills weekly, multiply by
52 and then divide by 12 to arrive at the monthly payment amount.
Include payments on past credit-card charges, but as for future charges,
record the items purchased.

Assessing Your Spending Habits
Congratulations! You’ve just taken the most important step on the road to
financial recovery. To varying degrees, we all live in a self-imposed fog when
it comes to spending money. Spending becomes a comfortable habit — just
the way you go about your daily business — and habits are always hard to
break. But now you’re on your way.
Now that you’ve committed yourself to recovery, we can take a closer look at
where your money is going, consider the possibility that overspending has
become a habit and, if so, examine ways to deal with it.
37
Chapter 2: Stopping the Bleeding

The devil’s in the details: Scrutinizing 
your expenses
Okay, documenting your expenses has proven the obvious: You’ve wasted
money, and probably made some lousy financial decisions. Who hasn’t? (If
you haven’t assessed your spending habits, see the section “Comparing Your
Income with Your Spending,” earlier in this chapter.) But now that you have a
handle on the problem, you’re in position to take control. In Chapter 22, we
offer some suggestions for a simpler lifestyle through financial “downshifting.”
With the right attitude, eliminating unnecessary expenditures can be a little
like a treasure hunt. There’s extra money somewhere; you just have to find it.
Although we wouldn’t presume to tell you how much to spend on any partic-
ular item — that’s your call — here are a few things to zero in on:
 Credit-card payments. If a big chunk of your monthly income is going to
pay credit-card bills (and for minimum payments at that), bankruptcy
may be far and away the best solution. Right now, you’re just spinning
your wheels — paying interest without significantly reducing the princi-
pal amount of the debts. Say that you’ve got a fairly modest credit-card
debt of about $3,000. At 17 percent interest — and a lot of times the inter-
est rate is a whole lot higher — you’ll be indebted to the credit-card com-
pany for about 35 years if you just make minimum payments.
 Daily dribbles. We all live our lives against a background of daily pat-
terns that eventually become habits. Many times, these habits include
unnecessary spending that provides no real benefit or enjoyment. What
seems like small stuff eventually adds up. Consider the $2 latte you get
on the way to work, a $1 you put in the soda pop machine, and the $2.50
you spend for an afternoon snack — all without thinking about it. Over
the course of a year, you’ve blown $1,430. To put it in perspective: If you
invested this money for 20 years at 10 percent interest, you’d end up
with more than $80,000!
 Extravagances. Admittedly, one person’s luxury is another’s necessity,
but you really need to think long and hard before plopping down $100
for a restaurant meal or $60 to watch a pay-for-view prize fight on televi-
sion. It’s sometimes helpful — albeit painful — to figure out how much
work you had to do to pay for a particular treat. For example, if a night
on the town costs you a day and a half of work, you may think twice
about the return on your investment.
 Impulse purchases. A little later in this chapter, in the section “Getting a
Handle on What You Own,” we ask you to list all your belongings, but for
now, just make a trip to your attic, basement, and garage. If you’re like
most people — and us — you’ll see tons of stuff you’ve bought but
rarely if ever use. Simplify.
38
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

 Gifts. Studies show that many folks spend lavishly on gifts they would
never buy for themselves. Christmas, of course, is the granddaddy of
budget-busters.
 Overwhelming mortgage payments. If you obtained your mortgage
recently, most of your monthly payment goes toward the interest. 
So, you may not have much equity, and the home may not be worth
keeping — especially if it’s a second mortgage. For more on this topic,
see Chapter 12.
 Killer car payments. New cars are awfully pricey these days, partly
because they’re more dependable and longer lasting. If you’re struggling
to maintain payments on a new car, you may want to consider selling
your expensive car and buying something more affordable. Plenty of 
reliable, moderately priced used cars are on the market today.
Are you a spendaholic?
Similar to an addiction, compulsive spending can be a disease. If you’re so
afflicted, you may need professional assistance. Debtors Anonymous, a group
dedicated to helping folks curb excessive spending habits, has compiled a
checklist of the common signs of compulsive behavior. Ask yourself the fol-
lowing questions:
 Are your debts making your home life unhappy?
 Does the pressure of your debts distract you from your daily work?
 Are your debts affecting your reputation?
 Do your debts cause you to think less of yourself?
 Have you ever given false information to obtain credit?
 Have you ever made unrealistic promises to your creditors?
 Does the pressure of your debts make you careless of the welfare of your
family?
 Do you ever fear that your employer, family, or friends will find out the
extent of your total indebtedness?
 When faced with a difficult financial situation, does the prospect of bor-
rowing give you an inordinate feeling of relief?
 Does the pressure of your debts cause you to have difficulty sleeping?
 Has the pressure of your debts ever caused you to consider getting
drunk?
39
Chapter 2: Stopping the Bleeding

 Have you ever borrowed money without giving adequate consideration
to the rate of interest you’re required to pay?
 Do you usually expect a negative response when you’re subject to a
credit investigation?
 Have you ever developed a strict regimen for paying off your debts, only
to break it under pressure?
 Do you justify your debts by telling yourself that you’re superior to the
“other” people, and when you get your “break,” you’ll be out of debt
overnight?
If you answer yes to eight or more of the previous questions, you may be a
compulsive spender. An organization called Debtors Anonymous can help.
You can check out their Web site at www.DebtorsAnonymous.org, call
them at (781) 453-2743, or write to them at Debtors Anonymous, General
Service Office, P.O. Box 920888, Needham, MA 02492-0009.
You also may want to take a look at Chapter 22 to help reorder your spending
priorities.
Getting a Handle on What You Own
After you figure out what your spending habits and your earnings are (see the
sections earlier in this chapter), it’s also a good time to get an equally firm
grasp on what you own. Documenting your assets does the following:
 Creates a basis for figuring out what property you may lose by filing
bankruptcy
 Lets you know if avoiding bankruptcy by selling things is a viable option
 Demonstrates how little you have to show for thousands of dollars of
credit-card debt
Use Table 2-3 to document what you own. If you need some help figuring out
how much you stuff is worth, take a look at Chapter 10.
Documenting your assets when you’re close to bankruptcy is depressing.

Figuring Out How Much You Owe
Purveyors of consumer credit want you to think in terms of monthly pay-
ments instead of considering the total amount you’ll owe. It’s a lot easier to
sell that new car when the customer focuses on a $400 monthly payment
rather than on a $25,000 albatross. But when it comes to assessing your finan-
cial condition, knowing the total amount of your debts is critical.
Home and car loans should be considered separately from other debts for
two reasons:
 These loans can be reduced or eliminated if you sell the house or car.
 Bankruptcy affects home and car loans differently than other debts.
You can find out how much you owe on these loans by phoning the creditor.
If you’re behind in payments, also find out how much it will take to bring the
loan current (as opposed to the amount required to pay the loan in full).
Filling the blanks in Table 2-4 helps you get a grip on what you owe.

Calculating how much you owe on other debts is a little tougher.
Ordering credit reports is one place to start. See Chapter 6 for tips on getting
credit reports.
You can frequently determine the amounts owed on judgments, child sup-
port, alimony, fines, and restitution obligations from documents on file in the
courthouse.
You can get a rough idea of how much you owe on income taxes by looking at
copies of your income tax returns, but this method won’t give you the
amount of penalties and interest that has accrued. See Chapter 9 and Chapter
15 for more info on dealing with tax obligations.
Hopefully, you have a rough idea of how much you owe on student loans. If
not, you’ll probably have to find out more than you want to about how the stu-
dent loan industry works just to find out whom to ask. Check out Chapter 18.
After you know what you owe, use Table 2-5 to help you keep track of it.
If creditors don’t how where you live, or have given up on you, don’t ring
their bell by calling them.

In This Chapter
 Appreciating why you need a lawyer
 Finding a lawyer you can trust, and figuring out how to pay her
 Identifying friends and foes
I
n your pursuit of a fresh financial start, you’ll encounter a rather large cast
of characters, at least indirectly. One player, and only one, is unequivo-
cally on your side: your lawyer. Others, such as the trustee, look out for the
interests of your creditors. And the judge is supposed to function as a neutral
arbiter. This chapter identifies the troupe, their roles on the bankruptcy
stage, and how those factors relate to you and your goals. It also includes —
in the sidebar at the end — a brief vocabulary list for you to look at so that
you can understand what everyone is talking about.
Finding Professional Help
One of the challenges of putting your financial house in order is getting an
accurate, trustworthy, and unbiased assessment of your particular options.
Obtaining objective advice is absolutely essential because you’re going to 
be bombarded with conflicting information and opinions about bankruptcy.
Despite their best intentions, friends or relatives may mislead you. And so
can the following groups of people:
 Credit counselors, who ostensibly help with budgeting and dealing with
creditors, may inappropriately discourage you from filing for bankruptcy,
and, instead, push for a secret agenda. Although they may appear to be
independent, many of them are on creditors’ payrolls, so their interests
may be completely at odds with yours.

 Debt consolidators, offering to replace your many monthly bills with a
single “low-interest, easy payment loan,” sometimes use sophisticated
marketing ploys to dazzle you into believing that you can get out of debt
by borrowing more money. You can’t.
 Bill collectors are willing to tell you just about anything to squeeze
some money out of you.
You need to act with your head, and not your heart, when making a cold, cal-
culated, harsh judgment of what truly is in your best interests. This section
explains why you need a lawyer, how to find one, and how to deal with legal
and other costs associated with filing bankruptcy.
Answering why a lawyer is a must
An old adage says that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client.
Nowhere is that statement more true than in the area of bankruptcy law, and
never was it truer than today. Bankruptcy law is incredibly complex particu-
larly in the wake of the Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco (or BARF, as we and
many others refer to the laws enacted in 2005), and many attorneys with suc-
cessful general practices have difficulty keeping up to date.
With a new and remarkably obtuse new law on the books, even attorneys and
judges struggle to figure out just what Congress meant when it rewrote the
bankruptcy code. The Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco — or BARF — is so
poorly conceived and ill-written that it will take the courts ages to figure out
just what Congress has done (not that the folks in Congress have any clue). 
A conscientious bankruptcy lawyer will have to monitor developments regu-
larly just to stay in the game, and that’s the person you need at your side.
Filing bankruptcy is not the time to rely on paralegals and document prepara-
tion services. They just don’t have the time, expertise, or stomach to deal
with BARF. And neither do you.
Don’t listen to anyone who tells you that he handled his own bankruptcy 
and everything went just fine. Prior to BARF, some folks did manage to suc-
cessfully file bankruptcy without a lawyer, but things have changed — 
dramatically!
Finding a good lawyer
Certainly no shortage of “free” advice exists out there, but most of it is worth
about what it costs — nothing, if that. When you’re serious about considering
bankruptcy, you need a lawyer — simple as that. So how do you go about
finding one?
48
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

You can check with friends and relatives who have filed bankruptcy, and, if
you already know a reputable attorney whose firm does not handle bank-
ruptcy cases, he is likely to know a good source of advice. They won’t know-
ingly send their clients to hacks. (For tips about meeting with your lawyer,
see Chapter 6.)
Understanding what to expect 
from your lawyer
Some lawyers offer a “free” initial consultation, which means the only way
that they make any money is if you end up filing bankruptcy. That approach
can skew their judgment.
You’re probably better off paying an attorney for an hour of his or her time,
expecting to pay roughly $100 to $200 per hour. When you’re paying a fee,
you have every right to insist on a consultation with the attorney who actu-
ally would be handling your case, not some paralegal or assistant. Whenever
a law firm won’t make this commitment or tries to shift you to someone else,
take your business and your money elsewhere.
Paying the piper
Filing a Chapter 7, the type of bankruptcy that doesn’t involve any kind of
repayment plan, costs you a $274 court fee. A Chapter 13 filing, where you
repay a portion of your debts over time, costs $189. Legal fees vary widely,
depending on where you live and how complicated your case is.
In the past, lawyers would typically charge a fixed fee for personal bankruptcy,
with additional charges for an unusually complicated case. Under BARF, a
“routine” bankruptcy case doesn’t exist anymore. They’re all complicated.
Ultimately, your attorney fees depend on how much time the lawyer spends
on your case. You can minimize that effort by getting all your ducks in a row
before meeting with the attorney. If you’ve collected all your asset and debt
information and read enough of this book to forego the most basic questions,
you can cut down on the billable hours.
In a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, all attorney fees must be paid before filing. You
can pay fees over an extended time period in a Chapter 13 filing.
Considering your current financial situation, you’re probably wondering
where you’re going to find money to pay for your bankruptcy filing. Here 
are a few suggestions:
49
Chapter 3: Meeting the Players

 After you decide to file bankruptcy, you don’t need to make any more
payments on debts that ultimately will be eliminated (such as most
credit-card debts). That alone is likely to free up a fair amount of cash to
apply toward your legal and court costs.
 You can sell assets to raise the money. This move is smart one when-
ever you’d otherwise be forced to forfeit these assets when you file
bankruptcy.
 A friend or relative can give you the money to file, if you ask nicely. An
employer may even pony up bankruptcy fees to focus the employee’s
attention on the job rather than on his or her financial problems and
avoid the hassle of dealing with creditors trying to attach or garnish the
employee’s wages.
50
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
Surfing for consumer info on the Internet
Information that you glean from the Internet can
be a godsend. It also can also be god-awful.
Some Web sites are sponsored by debt consol-
idation companies, which earn fees from
debtors and creditors when they convince the
former to undertake debt repayment plans; even
folks with no hope of success and clients who’d
be far better off in bankruptcy. For that matter,
even well-intentioned sites sometimes provide
erroneous information. Oops.
Still other sites that appear consumer-oriented
actually sell advertising to mortgage lenders
and credit-card issuers. So-called experts on
these sites frequently try to convince people to
borrow even more, often by advising visitors to
take out second and third mortgages against
their homes when they actually need to file
bankruptcy and start out fresh.
That said, we’ve found that the following Web
sites are consistently reliable and informative:
 Consumer Federation of America (www.
ConsumerFed.org): The Consumer
Federation of America (CFA) in Washington,
D.C. is a terrific source. In our experience,
the folks at the Consumer Federation are
informed, diligent, and up-to-date. Many
consumer-rights folks, and more than a few
policymakers, rely on the CFA to honestly
and thoroughly evaluate the real impact of
legislation on real, live consumers.
 National Consumer Law Center (www.
ConsumerLaw.org):
The 
National
Consumer Law Center (NCLC) offers ton of
useful and reliable consumer information on
its Web site.
 Debtors 
Anonymous 
(www.Debtors
Anonymous.org): Debtors Anonymous pro-
vides a wealth of insight on compulsive
spending and offers the opportunity to chat
with others about money problems without
anyone trying to lend you money, sell you
something, or sign you up for some screwy
debt repayment plans.

Borrowing money to pay attorney fees is a dicey proposition; the idea, after
all, is getting out of debt, not accumulating more. In any case, one definite is
“Don’t borrow money from anyone without first revealing your plan to file
bankruptcy.” If you do, that creditor may claim that you’re guilty of fraud and
try to keep the debt from being wiped out. See Chapters 13 and 15.
Getting to Know the Players
Bankruptcy is an adversarial process in which individuals with competing
interests struggle against one another to — hopefully — achieve a balanced
and fair result. Bankruptcy court is the playing field, and the judge is the ref-
eree. The people you can encounter in the bankruptcy system all have differ-
ent roles to play.
Although the players act politely and respectfully toward each other most of
the time, keep in mind that the only person responsible for looking out for
your best interests is your lawyer.
Bankruptcy judge
The justice system is blessed with scores of dedicated, thoughtful bankruptcy
judges who conscientiously strive to fairly balance the competing interests.
Some judges, of course, are better than others, but in the scheme of things,
that also means that others are downright bad. Some judges are biased, and
some have agendas. And even good judges sometimes make mistakes. Luckily,
rulings by bankruptcy judges can be reviewed by other federal judges — and
sometimes even the United States Supreme Court.
Unlike some other federal jurists, bankruptcy judges don’t enjoy lifetime
appointments. The federal court must reappoint them when their 14-year
terms expire. Recently, several well-respected judges were denied reappoint-
ment because creditors’ groups lobbied powers with political muscle, claim-
ing the judges were too sympathetic to debtors. This development — we’ll 
go so far as to call it a trend — can’t help but weigh on judges.
Regardless, in our experience, few judges (consciously) allow outside influ-
ences to color their decision making. And the decisions of those who do tend
to be reversed on appeal. In other words, be aware that the judge may not be
as objective as you’d hope, but don’t lose any sleep over it.

Chapter 3: Meeting the Players

In all likelihood, you’ll never even see the bankruptcy judge who handles
your case. Other players usually can resolve issues through negotiation and
settlement, and the judge is called in only when a problem is encountered.
Still, you can feel reassured in knowing that if all else fails, you can always
take it to the judge and make a federal case out of it.
Case trustee
The most visible player in a bankruptcy filing is the case trustee. Your rela-
tionship with this trustee differs depending on whether you file a Chapter 7
liquidation or a Chapter 13 reorganization.
Chapter 7: The panel trustee
The trustee in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy is appointed at random from a panel 
of (usually) lawyers. You encounter your case trustee when you meet a 341
meeting, where debtors answer questions about their assets and financial
affairs (see Chapter 6).
A Chapter 7 trustee’s main mission is selling property and doling the pro-
ceeds out to creditors. Any nonexempt property — stuff that can be taken to
satisfy your debts — is up for grabs, and so is money received within six
months of filing bankruptcy from life insurance, inheritances, or divorce
property divisions. The trustee also can recover some transfers and pay-
ments that you made before filing bankruptcy (see Chapter 19 for more
details). For his troubles, the case trustee gets a commission based on how
much money is collected.
After reviewing your bankruptcy documents, the case trustee asks you some
questions to determine whether any assets can be sold to cover your debts.
Although the Chapter 7 trustee isn’t necessarily your friend, he needn’t be
your enemy either. Most case trustees are reasonable people just trying to ful-
fill their roles within the confines of the law. So, try not to take it personally.
Granted, the thought of someone scrounging through your belongings and
putting them up for sale is inherently offensive. But you don’t need to worry
that the trustee will turn your living room into a Salvation Army store. In 96
percent of Chapter 7 cases, no assets actually are liquidated, because they’re
all exempt or because they’re not worth enough to bother with.
Be aware, however, that a trustee is likely to pounce on anything that looks
like easy pickings — like income tax refunds for past years and the current
year. But remember that he can’t take future tax refunds.
52
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

If the trustee doesn’t pursue an asset, it’s yours after your bankruptcy case 
is closed — provided that you accurately described it on your bankruptcy
papers. For that reason, making sure that your paperwork is complete, accu-
rate, and honest is extremely important. Besides, doing so may keep you out
of jail.
The trustee also asks about payments and transfers of assets that you made
prior to bankruptcy to see whether he can recover them for the benefit of
creditors (see Chapter 19).
Chapter 13: The standing trustee
A Chapter 13 trustee has a different role, and you meet him or her at your 
341 meeting. The trustee questions you about your assets and scrutinizes
your income and expenses and generally tries to make sure that your repay-
ment plan meets technical requirements and has a reasonable chance of 
succeeding.
Unlike a Chapter 7 trustee, a Chapter 13 trustee doesn’t typically liquidate any
property. Instead, the trustee collects monthly payments that you make under
a Chapter 13 repayment plan and receives a commission based on these pay-
ments. The longer that you make required payments, the more the trustee
earns. So the Chapter 13 trustee has an incentive in helping you succeed with
your repayment plan.
Some Chapter 13 trustees sponsor personal financial management courses,
hoping that your attending them will increase your chances for successfully
completing the repayment plan. So far, the jury is out on whether debtor edu-
cation leads to higher Chapter 13 success rates. But if the option is there,
take it. You’ve nothing to lose.

Bumping heads with Uncle Sam
Chrissie was, like, totally not into completing the
financial questionnaire her lawyer gave her. So-
oh, she pretty much made up the answers while
watching MTV. Chrissie didn’t really mean to
deceive anyone, but digging up all that stuff is a
drag, and she really had more fun things to do.
So, she winged it. Who’d ever care?
Chrissie’s papers were so riddled with errors
that the judge had a fit, refused to wipe out her
debts, fined her — and referred the matter to
federal prosecutors for possible criminal action.
Chrissie totally couldn’t deal with that!
But the U.S. Attorney could. And did.
Bum-mer!

U.S. Trustee
The U.S. Trustee, an employee of the U.S. Department of Justice, is an entirely
different creature than the case trustee. A U.S. Trustee heads one of 21 regional
offices. The head of the entire United States Trustee program, the Executive
Director, is a political appointee of the U.S. Attorney General and, by extension,
of the current president.
The U.S. Trustee:
 Oversees private trustees and makes sure that they properly account for
all funds they receive.
 Watches out for fraud in bankruptcy cases and refers questionable mat-
ters to the U.S. Attorney for criminal prosecution.
 Conducts, in theory, 341 meetings. In practice, this chore usually is dele-
gated to the trustee assigned to your particular case.
 Grades the Means Test (this part of the new bankruptcy law is designed
to determine whether you’re really broke enough to file Chapter 7). 
If you flunk and are unwilling or unable to commit to a Chapter 13 
repayment plan, the U.S. Trustee may ask the court to dismiss your
bankruptcy.
 Can help whenever special accommodations must be made for the 341
meeting. For example, if you’re disabled or need an interpreter, the U.S.
Trustee tries to provide appropriate assistance.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
Talking the legal lingo
Legal eagles and legal beagles talk their own
language, and, oftentimes, the legalistic mean-
ing of a word or concept is different than the
generic definition. So having a basic familiarity
with legalese is a good idea so that you can
communicate effectively with the lawyerly sorts
you’ll likely encounter whenever you decide to
take this journey.
Automatic stay: The instant your bankruptcy
petition is filed, an automatic court order keeps
the creditors at bay. They can’t garnish your
wages, repossess your car, start or continue
foreclosure proceedings, sue you, or even con-
tact you about your debts. And, if they do, they’ll
have a federal judge — and probably an angry
one at that — to answer to.
Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention And Consumer
Protection Act of 2005 (also known as the
Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco or “BARF”:
The most extensive revision of the bankruptcy
code since 1978. The law, written and paid for
by the consumer credit industry, applies to all
bankruptcies filed on or after October 17, 2005.
Despite the official name, nothing in the law
really protects consumers. A more accurate
name would be the “irresponsible lender pro-
tection act,” but we’ll settle for BARF.

55
Chapter 3: Meeting the Players
Collateral: An asset that backs up a specific
debt.
Confirmation: A court order making a Chapter
13 plan binding on the debtor and all creditors.
Discharge: When your case is over, a court
order wipes out or “discharges” your debts.
Exempt property: Some property is yours to
keep, regardless of the bankruptcy. Those pos-
sessions are said to be exempt — or off limits
to creditors.
Foreclosure: The way a creditor turns collateral
into cash. When the collateral is real property
(essentially land and buildings), an actual lawsuit
sometimes (but not always) is required. Many
states provide a method of nonjudicial foreclo-
sure in which real property is sold at public auc-
tion at a specified time — typically about four
months — after notice of the sale has been pub-
lished. When the collateral is personal property,
a nonjudicial sale can be held with as little as ten
days’ notice. Foreclosure should be distin-
guished from repossession, which, by itself,
doesn’t terminate your interest in the collateral.
Joint bankruptcy: Your spouse doesn’t have to
file bankruptcy just because you’re filing, but if
both of you go that route, the petition is called a
joint bankruptcy.
Lien: Some debts are backed up by specific
assets (collateral), which the creditor can seize
if you don’t pay. For example, when you buy a
house, the bank holds a mortgage that places a
lien on your home as collateral for the mort-
gage. Similarly, your car oftentimes is used as
collateral for a loan. Again, that is a lien.
Means Test: The keystone of BARF and the main
hurdle to those searching for financial salvation.
A complicated set of calculations that is sup-
posed to identify those consumers who can pay
a significant portion of their debt and therefore
should be required to do so instead of immedi-
ately shedding their obligations in Chapter 7.
When all is said and done, the test applies only to
debtors earning more than the median income
for their state. Even when it does apply, just
about everyone who jumps through all the hoops
will pass it and qualify for Chapter 7.
No-asset case: A Chapter 7 case in which the
value of a debtor’s assets isn’t high enough to
bother liquidating any of them.
Personal property: Anything you own that’s not
attached to land — and that includes your car,
household goods, bank accounts, pensions, and
so on — is considered personal property, as
opposed to real property,and is subject to special
rules in bankruptcy. In some states, even mobile
homes are considered personal property, as long
as they’re not permanently tied to the ground.
Petition date: The date that your bankruptcy
petition is filed.
Property of the estate: Everything that you own
as of the petition date is deemed property of the
estate and therefore is potentially at risk in
bankruptcy.
Reaffirmation: Even if bankruptcy would wipe
out a debt, you can promise to repay what you
owe. And why would you want to do that? Good
question! See Chapter 13 for situations where
reaffirmation may make sense.
Redemption: Say you bought a refrigerator and
stove for $1,500, and those appliances now are
worth only $500, but you still owe $1,000.
Redemption enables you to keep the refrigera-
tor and stove by making a lump sum payment of
$500. The remainder of the debt is wiped out.
Repossession: Where a creditor obtains pos-
session of collateral if you don’t pay.
341 meeting: About 40 days after filing your
bankruptcy petition, a meeting is scheduled at
which a trustee (the person who represents the
interests of creditors in bankruptcy matters) and
creditors can quiz you about your assets and
debts. It’s named a 341 meeting after a particu-
lar section of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Creditors
Although creditors certainly are players in the process, you shouldn’t have
much to do with them after your case is filed. They may attend the 341 meet-
ing and ask a few questions, but most won’t bother.
Any contact that you have with creditors will probably be only in the context
of surrendering collateral or making arrangements to keep it after you file
(see Chapter 10).

Deciding Which Type of
Bankruptcy Is Best for You
In This Chapter
 Considering the impact of bankruptcy on your spouse
 Understanding your options
 Weighing Chapter 7 versus Chapter 13
 Looking at other forms of bankruptcy
 Changing your mind
P
ersonal bankruptcy comes in a variety of flavors. You can find advan-
tages and disadvantages to using any bankruptcy option, and we explore
those pluses and minuses in this chapter.
The vast majority of consumers opt for Chapter 7, where you immediately
eliminate most of your debts, surrender any nonexempt assets — those that
can be sold off for the benefit of creditors — and go merrily on your way.
Another common choice is Chapter 13, where you keep your stuff but have 
to make payments to a trustee for several years. After that, any remaining
balances on most debts are wiped out.
In addition, if you can qualify as a family farmer or family fisherman, another
option, Chapter 12, is probably the way to go. And finally, there’s Chapter 11,
a form of bankruptcy commonly used for business reorganizations, that may
just provide a remedy for you.
Deciding Whether to Fly Solo 
or As a Married Couple
Many married people assume that they’re automatically responsible for each
other’s debts. Wrong.

You are, of course, liable for your own debts and any monetary obligations
that you accept by cosigning for a loan or a credit card obtained by your
spouse or significant other. When you cosign, you tell the creditor that if your
mate doesn’t pay up, you will.
An ancient doctrine of necessaries, concocted in an era when only husbands
were the breadwinners, states that if a husband wasn’t bringing home the
bacon, his wife could go out and buy essential items by charging them to his
credit.
In our enlightened era , however, the doctrine of necessaries pops up when,
for example, a hospital argues that a wife is responsible for her husband’s
medical services. Hospitals frequently claim that under the doctrine of neces-
saries, both spouses are liable for services provided to one spouse or to one
of their dependents. Although that argument is a mile wide and an inch deep
(and often unsuccessful), when medical expenses overwhelm you, filing a
joint bankruptcy usually is easier than battling with hospitals.
If you live in one of nine community-property states (Arizona, California,
Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin),
the rules are different. Husbands or wives frequently find themselves on the
hook for their spouses’ debts because so-called community property of both
is subject to debts incurred by either. Community property includes the earn-
ings of either spouse and all property acquired by either the husband or the
wife during the marriage, except for gifts and inheritances.
Even if you and your spouse must file bankruptcy, you don’t have to file
jointly. In fact, you may find advantages to filing separately (see Chapters 5,
10, and 12).
And, just in case you’re wondering, you must actually be married to file a joint
bankruptcy. If you aren’t, you and your significant other — even if you’re in a
long-term, committed relationship that closely resembles marriage — must
file separate bankruptcies even if most of the debts are joint. And under the
federal Defense of Marriage Act, 1 U.S.C. 7, a same-sex partner cannot qualify
as a spouse under the Bankruptcy Code, even in states recognizing same-sex
marriages.
Looking at Your Probable 
Bankruptcy Choices
Your basic choice is between a bankruptcy that doesn’t involve any type of
repayment plan (Chapter 7 bankruptcy), and one that does (Chapters 11,12,
and 13). You need to base your decision on what’s best for you and your
family, not on what you think will make your creditors happy.
58
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Chapter 7: Straight bankruptcy
Chapter 7, which occasionally is referred to as straight bankruptcy, is essen-
tially the belly-up version that most people envision when they hear the word
bankruptcy. If you file under Chapter 7, most of your debts are eliminated, and
some of your property may go to your creditors. You don’t have any repay-
ment plan; your debts simply disappear.
Assets that are nonexempt (or ripe for picking by creditors) may be seized
and sold by the trustee, with the proceeds distributed to your creditors. In
the real world, however, most consumer bankruptcies fall in the category of
no-asset cases. In other words, you have nothing for creditors to take, except
the shirt on your back and various other items that are off-limits. That’s a
pretty nifty deal and, if things work out, you’ve little to lose except your debt.
The law is not about to let you bounce from one spending spree to another
with bankruptcy functioning as your escape hatch, so for the most part, if
you go bankrupt today, you can’t file again for another eight years. As a tech-
nical matter, you can still file under Chapter 7, even if you got a bankruptcy
discharge within the past eight years — but there’s no sense in doing so. If
you had your debts wiped out in bankruptcy less than eight years ago, your
latest financial obligations would not be discharged with a new Chapter 7, so
filing would be pointless.
Two caveats, though. The eight-year restriction
 Applies only if you actually received a discharge in the earlier case. If
your case was dismissed prior to completion, the eight-year rule doesn’t
apply, and you’re free to file anew.
 Does not apply if your prior bankruptcy was a Chapter 13 reorganiza-
tion, and creditors received at least 70 percent of their claims.
Note that the eight-year restriction applies only when the second case is 
filed under Chapter 7. If the second case is filed under Chapter 13, different
rules apply. See the section “Chapter 13: Debt repayment plans,” later in this
chapter.
Confronting the Means Test
The main obstacle to Chapter 7 is the Means Test, a creation of the BARF law
that Congress passed in 2005. The Means Test (we’ll resist the urge to call it
the “mean test” — on second thought, no, we won’t ) requires a complicated
set of calculations that are supposed to identify those consumers who can
pay a significant portion of their bills and should be required to do so instead
of shedding all their obligations in Chapter 7. The Means Test doesn’t apply
to debtors earning less than the median income for their state, and most of
those earning more than the median are still able to pass.
59
Chapter 4: Deciding Which Type of Bankruptcy Is Best for You

We’ve devoted all of Chapter 5 to passing the Means Test. For now, the thing
to remember is that if you’re broke and have little left over at the end of
month for debt payments, one way or the other (assuming that you receive
good advice), you’ll be able to pass the Means Test, although it will surely be
a pain in the butt for both you and your lawyer.
Good faith
In addition to looking at your ability to pay, some judges also consider
whether you’re acting in good faith. They may ask whether
 Your bankruptcy was necessitated by sudden illness, calamity, or 
unemployment.
 You made unnecessary eve-of-bankruptcy purchases far exceeding your
ability to pay.
 Your bankruptcy paperwork is complete and accurate.
Although you eventually must check with a bankruptcy specialist who’s
familiar with local judges to get a reading on what to expect, you can do one
thing immediately to avert a possible good-faith problem: Make darned sure
that your bankruptcy papers are accurate and that you list each and every
income and each and every expense. Guesstimating just doesn’t cut it. When
you don’t know the answer, look it up . . . don’t make it up.
Chapter 13: Debt repayment plans
In filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you propose a debt repayment schedule,
and, for the next 36 to 60 months, you pay what you can afford. The two
types of payments that you may have to make are
 To a trustee, who doles out money to creditors.
 So-called payments outside the plan, which are payments that are coming
due after you file and are paid directly to the creditor.
Creditors usually end up receiving only a small percentage of what they’re
owed and typically must settle for pennies on the dollar. After that, you’re
home-free.
You can’t eliminate debts in Chapter 13 if you have received a discharge in a
prior case filed under Chapter 7, 11, or 12 within the past four years, or a dis-
charge in a case filed under Chapter 13 within the past two years.
60
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Even if you can’t eliminate debts, if the above restrictions apply, you can still
use Chapter 13 to keep creditors off your back while you pay them in full over
three to five years. Only individuals with regular income (no corporations, no
partnerships) can file under Chapter 13. The source of your income isn’t
important (assuming, of course, that you didn’t rob the local convenience
store or get it in some other illegal fashion), provided that it is regular and
stable. Your income can be wages, self-employment profits, unemployment
benefits, or even assistance from friends and family.
To qualify for Chapter 13, your debts must fall within specific limits. Your unse-
cured debts — those where nothing, like a car, can be repossessed if you don’t
pay — can’t be more than $307,675. Secured debts can’t exceed $922,975. You
can find out more about secured and unsecured debts in Chapter 11.
Certain debts, known as priority claims, must be paid in full over the life of
any Chapter 13 plan. The most common priority claims are support obliga-
tions and recent taxes. Really big child-support obligations that you can’t
possibly pay off over 60 months or tax arrearages, as a practical matter, make
you ineligible for Chapter 13 because those debts must be paid in full over a
maximum of 60 months. If you can’t repay those bills within five years, you’re
better off not filing under Chapter 13.
The length of your repayment plan depends on how much you earn and
whether you have any nonexempt assets — stuff that could be taken to satisfy
the claims of creditors. Every plan must satisfy two tests: the best-interest
test and the best-efforts test.
 Best-interest test: Unsecured creditors must receive at least as much as
they’d get when you file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy rather than a Chapter 13.
If all your property is exempt and unsecured creditors would receive
nothing in a Chapter 7, the best-interest test isn’t a factor. On the other
hand, when you have nonexempt property, your plan must propose to
pay at least that much.
61
Chapter 4: Deciding Which Type of Bankruptcy Is Best for You
A committed mate saves the day
Moira and Scott lived together for 12 years.
Instead of working, Moira ran the household,
helped raise Scott’s boys, and attended to
Scott’s infirm mother.
During their relationship, Scott took care of all
household expenses and agreed to do so during
the life of Moira’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.
The judge was so impressed by Moira’s and
Scott’s commitment to each other that he held
that Scott’s voluntary contributions to Moira
qualified as income for Chapter 13 purposes and
approved her Chapter 13 plan.

Look at it this way: If you own investment property worth $10,000 and
file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the trustee probably will sell the property
and distribute the proceeds among creditors. On the other hand, if you
file under Chapter 13, you keep the property, but you still have to pay at
least as much as creditors would otherwise receive had you gone the
Chapter 7 route — their share of the $10,000.
 Best-efforts test: Chances are you can’t possibly pay unsecured credi-
tors in full, and the court and your creditors know that. So, although the
law doesn’t expect you to make good on everything, it nevertheless
requires you to do the best you can. If your monthly income is more
than the median for your state, allowable expenses are based on Internal
Revenue Collection Financial Standards, and the plan must run for five
years. Otherwise, the amount of your payment is based on your actual
expenses, so long as they’re reasonable. See Chapter 5 for the lowdown
on which expenses are allowed under the Internal Revenue Collections
Financial Standards.
In Chapter 13, you won’t have any extra cash burning a hole in your
pocket, but you will have what you need to get by. You’ll even have a
modest entertainment allowance.

Mike makes the grade
Mike chooses Chapter 13 because he’s got a
home he wants to keep, as well as a family heir-
loom — an antique piano worth $5,000, and not
exempt from creditors if he goes Chapter 7. Mike
earns less than the median income for his state
and, after paying routine monthly living expenses,
had just $500 left at the end of the month to cover
his $35,000 in credit card debts and $4,000 in mort-
gage arrearages. To satisfy the best-interests test
under a 36-month plan, Mike needs to pay $250
per month to cover the mortgage payments and
the cost of the piano. He essentially has to buy the
piano back from creditors even though it never
changes hands. So, he’s looking at $4,000 for the
mortgage + $5,000 for the piano, which equals
$9,000. And $9,000 divided by 36 (the number of
months the repayment plan will run) is $250. But
that’s only half the story, because Mike also has
to worry about the best-efforts test. When that’s
factored in, he’s got to pay all of his disposable
income — $500 — for 36 months. Then, finally, his
mortgage is current, his credit card bills are a dis-
tant memory — and the baby grand keeps hum-
ming away in the family home.

situations, making the right choice can be devilishly difficult. This section
provides some general guidelines for you.
Recognizing when Chapter 7 is best
Chapter 7 probably is your best choice when all the following statements are
true:
 You don’t have any assets that you’d have to surrender to a trustee.
 You’re current on home and car payments, or willing to give them up.
 You don’t have much money left over each month after paying expenses.
 You haven’t received a bankruptcy discharge in an earlier case filed
within the past eight years.
Considering Chapter 13 as 
your number-one option
Chapter 13 is probably the way to go in any of these situations:
 You want to catch up on mortgage payments.
 You need time to pay off past-due support obligations.
 You owe tax debts that you want to pay off without interest or penalties.
 You received a discharge in a bankruptcy case filed within the past eight
years.
 You earn enough money to pay monthly expenses with ease and want to
do your best to repay creditors at least some amount.
Discovering the advantages of Chapter 13
We discuss the upshot of Chapter 13 in detail throughout the book, but as a
general proposition, the benefits are
 You can pay taxes over time, possibly — note we emphasize possibly —
without interest or penalties.
 Your overdue alimony and child support can be stretched out and paid
off over three to five years.
 You can get your house and car payments up to date over the life of the
plan.
63
Chapter 4: Deciding Which Type of Bankruptcy Is Best for You

 You can reduce payments on some secured loans to the value of the col-
lateral. If, for example, collateral securing a loan is worth only $2,000 but
you owe $5,000, you’d have to pay only $2,000, not the full amount of the
loan. This option is not available when you financed the purchase of a in
motor vehicle within 910 days before bankruptcy or financed the pur-
chase of other types of personal property acquired within one year prior
to bankruptcy. In these situations, you must either pay the full amount
of the debt or surrender the collateral. See Chapter 11 for more on pur-
chase money security interests — where the item you buy serves as col-
lateral for a loan for its purchase price.
 You can keep nonexempt property.
 You can get some bankruptcy relief even though you received a dis-
charge in a prior Chapter 7, 11, or 12 bankruptcy case filed less than
eight years ago.
 You can protect a cosigner from creditor harassment by proposing to
pay the cosigned debt over the life of the plan.
Another advantage of Chapter 13 is that you can back out when you change
your mind, or if things don’t play out as expected. Conversely, after you file
Chapter 7, you can’t get out without the court’s permission — and that can
be pretty tough to get.
Having the leeway to jump out of Chapter 13 doesn’t mean you can hop back
when the mood strikes you. You have to wait 180 days before you can file
again if your case was dismissed at your request after a creditor asked the
court for relief from the automatic stay, which stops collection activities after
a case is filed; or because you disobeyed an order of the court.
Exploring disadvantages of Chapter 13
One obvious disadvantage of Chapter 13 is that it usually takes at least three
years to complete. During this time
 You may feel like you’re on a leash . . . because you are.
 You’ll probably have to give up your income tax refunds.
 You may receive an unexpected windfall and then lose it to the trustee.
 You won’t be allowed to incur any more debts without the trustee’s 
consent.
 You can lose your job and your ability to maintain payments, resulting in
dismissal of your case.
 You may risk your homestead exemption (see Chapters 10, 12, and 20) if
you move or sell your home.
64
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Some people claim that a Chapter 13 filing is less detrimental to your credit
rating than a Chapter 7. We’re skeptical. When you file under Chapter 7, you
may actually be a more attractive credit risk. Reason: Your slate is clean, your
old debts are gone — and you can’t file a Chapter 7 to escape new debts for
eight years.
About two-thirds of Chapter 13 plans fail. Then, the bankruptcy protections
disappear, and the debt collectors are b-a-a-a-ck!!! They’ll resume all their col-
lection efforts, and there’s a real good chance they’ll force you into Chapter 7
in hopes of getting something out of you. (Some Chapter 13 plans, those
based on reality, are very successful. In Chapter 6, we guide you through a
Chapter 13 filing so that your chances of success are much higher than the
raw statistics would indicate.)
Advantages of Chapter 13 over nonbankruptcy repayment plans
Filing Chapter 13 usually is better than repayment agreements worked out by

 You pay only a small percentage of your total debts. Nonbankruptcy
repayment plans usually require you to pay your debts in full (except
perhaps some interest).
 You can deal with secured debts such as your home and car.
Nonbankruptcy plans typically do not address those debts.
 You don’t need the permission of the creditor to cut your obligation.
 You can invoke the automatic stay, which immediately stops creditors
from pursuing you.
 You’ll be allowed to catch up on back alimony and support obligations.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Considering Other Types of Bankruptcy
Although your case almost certainly falls under the Chapter 7 or 13 rubric, a
few other potential options bear thinking about.
Chapter 11: Large reorganizations
Whenever you don’t qualify for Chapter 13 and you have substantial assets
that you want to continue to control, Chapter 11 is worth looking into. But a
Chapter 11 proceeding is extremely complicated and expensive and, in all
honesty, rarely an option or even a smart choice for a nonbusiness debtor.
Still, it makes sense to see whether it works for you.
A Chapter 11 filing is a bankruptcy specialty in its own right. Many lawyers
concentrating on consumer bankruptcy don’t have much experience with
Chapter 11 cases. If you go this route, make sure that your lawyer is an expe-
rienced Chapter 11 practitioner.
Chapter 12: Reorganizations for family
farmers and fishermen
Chapter 12 is a special type of bankruptcy reserved for family farmers and
fisherman. Congress recognizes that those endeavors play a unique role in
our culture and economy and deserve special treatment.
If you qualify, Chapter 12 provides most of the benefits of Chapter 13, and
then some. Repayment plans aren’t restricted to five years, and you have
fewer limitations on the your ability to restructure home mortgages. The
downside of a Chapter 12 is that dischargeable debts are limited to those dis-
chargeable in a Chapter 7. So, you don’t get the super discharge available
with a Chapter 13 filing.
To qualify as a family farmer, you must meet each of the following 
requirements:
 Debts may not exceed $3,237,000.
 Fifty percent of those debts (excluding your home mortgage) must be
from farming operations.
 Fifty percent of your income from the preceding year, or from each of
the two years before that, must have come from farming operations.
But what exactly is a farmer? One debtor, whose sole income (less than
$10,000) for the year, before bankruptcy, came from the firewood he chopped
67
Chapter 4: Deciding Which Type of Bankruptcy Is Best for You

on his land, was deemed a family farmer. As a result, the court approved a
repayment plan that actually reduced the mortgage on his home so that it
would be paid off in 10 rather than 15 years.
To qualify as a family fisherman, you must meet each of the following 
requirements:
 Debts may not exceed $1.5 million.
 Eighty percent of those debts (excluding the home mortgage) must be
from commercial fishing operations.
 Fifty percent of income from the preceding year must have come from
commercial fishing operations.
Chapter 20: Adding Chapters 7 and 13
Although no Chapter 20 appears in the Bankruptcy Code, that term is used to
describe the practice of filing Chapter 7 to wipe out most of your debts and
then following up with a Chapter 13 to reap the benefits of both.
Say that you owe a bunch of credit-card bills and you’re under an order to
pay restitution for a crime. You can file Chapter 7 to get rid of the credit-card
bills and then file Chapter 13 to pay the restitution over three to five years.
We take a closer look at Chapter 20 bankruptcy in Chapter 18.
Changing Your Mind
After you’re in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, you can’t back out without the court’s
permission, and that’s a tough sell. For example, the day after filing Chapter
7, Steve crashed his car into the back of a minivan. When Soccer Dad threat-
ened to sue, Steve asked the bankruptcy court to dismiss his case so that he
could turn around and file a new one. That way, Steve figured, he could file a
new Chapter 7 and include any claims from the crash.
The bankruptcy court didn’t buy it because dismissing Steve’s case so that
he could turn right around and file another simply wasn’t in the best interests
of his creditors.
On the other hand, when you file Chapter 13, you can dismiss the case if
things don’t turn out as expected, or if you just change your mind.
You can also convert one type of bankruptcy to another, if you realize that
you’re better off taking a different route.
We take a closer look at converting from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 in Chapter 20.

Chapter 5
Confronting the Means Test
In This Chapter
 Understanding the Means Test
 Comparing your income to median incomes
 Applying the Means Test
 Beating the Means Test
T
he Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Act, or “BARF,” was regurgitated by the
109th Congress in 2005 after previous efforts to tighten the screws on
debtors failed. Its main ingredient is a so-called Means Test, which is essen-
tially a formula to determine whether you can really afford to cough up some
cash for your creditors. If you flunk the mean test — uh, Means Test — your
only option is to repay a portion of your debts over a five-year Chapter 13
plan. Chapter 7, where your debts are simply forgiven in exchange for turning
over any non-exempt property, is not an option — at least not at first. In other
words, if you flunk the Means Test, you’ll file under Chapter 13, although you
may be able to switch to Chapter 7 later if it turns out that you can’t make
your Chapter 13 plan payments.
In this chapter, we reveal that jumping though the Means Test is more of a
pain in the butt than a real obstacle to filing Chapter 7.
Putting the Means Test in Perspective
The first thing that you need to know is that odds are that you probably
won’t have to take the Means Test at all, provided you pass the Median Test. If
your income for the six months preceding bankruptcy is less than the median
income for your state, you’re home-free.

The basic theory behind the Means Test is that folks who earn more then the
median income should not be able to simply walk away from their debts in
Chapter 7 if they can pay a significant amount under a Chapter 13 repayment
plan. It’s hard to argue with that reasoning, but how will courts figure out
how much you can afford to pay? That’s where the Means Test comes into
play. This brain-twisting set of rules attempts to establish a one-size-fits-all
formula for what constitutes income, and how much of it you should be
paying for your living expenses.
Don’t worry too much about applying these rules — that’s your lawyer’s
problem. Your job is to organize your finances and provide your attorney the
information she needs to perform all the necessary calculations. (If you com-
pleted the worksheets in Chapter 2, you already have most of the information
you need.)
Keep in mind that the Means Test is aimed exclusively at consumers. It doesn’t
apply at all to folks whose debts are not “primarily” consumer debts. If your
debts are not primarily consumer debts (see the sidebar in this section), you
can scream “alleluia” at the top of your lungs and skip this chapter altogether.
Taking the Median Test
If you earn less than the median income, you don’t have to worry about the
Means Test. That’s the good news. But the bad news is, well — you don’t make
a whole lot of money. As a result of political compromises in Congress, Social
Security benefits aren’t counted as income for purposes of the Means Test,
but in the real world, this money may be what’s putting food on your table.
70
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
“Primarily” consumer debts
The Means Test applies only to debtors whose
debts are “primarily consumer debts” within the
meaning of the Bankruptcy Code.
Courts disagree both on what “primarily”
means as well as the meaning of “consumer
debts.” Most say that your debts are primarily
consumer debts if the dollar amount owed on
consumer debts exceeds the amount owed on
nonconsumer debts, without regard to the
number of debts.
Say that you owe $25,000 on two consumer
debts and only $15,000 on five nonbusiness
debts. Then your debts are primarily consumer
debts. The Bankruptcy Code defines “consumer
debt” as a “debt incurred by an individual pri-
marily for a personal, family, or household pur-
pose.” 11 U.S.C.§101(8).
Most courts agree that home mortgages are
consumer debts, but income tax liabilities are
not. They are about evenly split on whether stu-
dent loans are consumer debts. It would seem
that claims that aren’t based on contracts, such
as liability for an auto accident, should not be
considered “consumer debts,” and at least one
court has agreed.

Computing your income
First, you have to figure out your average monthly income during the six
months preceding bankruptcy and multiply this number by 12 to see how
you measure up against the median. The six-month period is determined as
ending on the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding your
bankruptcy. In other words, if you file in the middle of July, you average your
income for the months of January, February, March, April, May, and June,
regardless of which exact day in July you file. Table 5-1 sets out a worksheet
to help calculate your income.
Income does not include
 Social Security benefits
 Payments to victims of war crimes or crimes against humanity
 Payments to victims of terrorism (such as victims of the terrorist attack
on the World Trade Center)
Just about everything else is considered income, whether it’s taxable or not,
including
 Wages, salary, fees, commissions, and bonuses
 Retirement income
 Tax refunds
 Net income from any business dealings and sales of assets
 Net rental income
 Your share of any partnership income
 Support payments you receive
 Any money that others (including your spouse, if you don’t file a joint
bankruptcy) regularly contribute toward your living expenses
 Scholarships and other educational benefits
 Insurance payments and reimbursement under health and accident
plans
 Prizes and awards
 Compensation for illness or injury
 Gifts and inheritances
Although it’s not crystal-clear, we’re making an educated guess that income
would not include fringe benefits. Many observers think that income also
doesn’t include unemployment benefits because they can be traced to the
Social Security Act; we think that, just to be on the safe side, you should
include it unless your lawyer says otherwise.
71
Chapter 5: Confronting the Means Test

If your income is equal to or less than the median and you have all the infor-
mation required, your lawyer should charge you less for handling your 
bankruptcy.
Having income below the median is important even if you’re planning on
filing Chapter 13. Reason: If your income is above the median, a Chapter 13
plan must run for five years. Otherwise, a three-year plan is usually possible.
Here are some guidelines for evaluating your income:
 BARF determines “current monthly income” by examining all your aver-
age gross earnings for the past six months, not just take-home pay.
 In determining whether your income exceeds the median, your spouse’s
income is included whether you file bankruptcy jointly or not. Two
exceptions to this rule exist. Income of a nonfiling spouse doesn’t count
if you’re legally separated or if you’re living separate and apart, unless
you split up just to evade the Means Test. Even if all of your nonfiling
spouse’s income isn’t included, your income would include any amounts
that she regularly contributes to household expenses. The rule is differ-
ent when taking the Means Test — when figuring out how much surplus
income you have, income from a nonfiling spouse is included only to the
extent that she actually contributes toward your household expenses.
 Income taxes and other wage withholdings aren’t deducted in determin-
ing your income. They’re deducted as expense items.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Comparing your income to the median
In taking the Median Test, you compare your income with the median 
income for your state based on U.S. Census Bureau figures. The most 
current information is available from the clerk of the bankruptcy court or
from the United States Trustee at www.usdoj.gov/ust/bapcpa/means
testing.htm. To give you some idea of where you stand, Table 5-2 lists the
national medians. Table 5-3 contains a worksheet so that you can compare
your income to the median.
Table 5-2
National Gross Median Income
Size of Household
Annual Gross Median Income
One-person household
$37,168
Two-person household
$48,316
Three-person household
$55,624
Four-person household
$63,067
More than four-person household
Add $6,300 for each additional person
Of course, these figures vary depending on where you live. For example, the
median income for a four-person household in West Virginia is $51,795, while
in New Jersey, it’s $88,401! These places are the extremes, though. Median
incomes for most states are pretty close to the national medians.
These numbers are adjusted annually after the most recent census to reflect
changes in the Consumer Price Index, calculated from the date of the most
recent census to the year preceding the year of your bankruptcy.

Deducting Your Expenses and 
Taking the Means Test
After you calculate your BARF income, you get to the really hairy part — fig-
uring out what expenses are allowed. Remember, though, that if your income
is below the median (see “Taking the Median Test,” earlier in this chapter),
you’ve already passed the test, and you can skip the rest of this chapter.
Yippee!
The first thing you need to do is adjust the figure used in the Median Test if
you included the income of a spouse who isn’t filing bankruptcy with you.
Under the Means Test, if you and your spouse aren’t filing bankruptcy
together, her income counts only to the extent that she actually contributes
to family living expenses. Table 5-4 will help you adjust your income for the
Means Test — which can be different than the income figure used for the
Median Test.

your actual expenses
 Other actual necessary expenses allowed under IRS Standards
76
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

 Certain expenses specified in BARF
 Expenses for repayment of certain kinds of debts
These deductions were cobbled together in a series of compromises among
competing creditor interests and, as a result, are confusing, ambiguous, and
sometimes contradictory. But they are what they are, and hopefully we can
provide some navigational assistance.
IRS National and Local Standards
For years, the IRS allowed certain standard expenses to determine how much
a delinquent taxpayer would be forced to come up with to keep the feds off
his back. Congress, in enacting BARF, incorporated the amounts specified in
these standards without realizing that they didn’t quite mesh with other pro-
visions of BARF.
The IRS uses National Standards for living expenses, such as food, clothing,
housekeeping supplies, personal-care products and services (for example,
haircuts), plus an additional amount for discretionary spending ($100 per
month, plus $25 for each additional family member). The allowable amounts
depend on a person’s gross monthly income and family size and are adjusted
annually. Table 5-5 outlines the 2005 allowable amounts.

Deductions for certain debt payments
BARF also allows deductions for amounts you’re obligated to pay on
 Debts backed up by collateral — secured debts that will come due in the
future
 Past due amounts on debts secured by your car or home
 Payment past due on “priority debts”
Table 5-8 shows how to figure out which debt payments are allowed as
expenses under the Means Test.
Payments on secured debts coming due in the future
You’re allowed expense items for payments on secured debts that come due
in the next five years. If the obligation has more than five years to go, you
simply deduct the full amount of the monthly payment. This situation is typi-
cal with your mortgage. If you have less than five years to go on the contract,
you add the remaining payments and divide by 60. If, for example, you have
27 monthly payments of $200 left on your car, multiply $200 by 27 and divide
by 60, arriving at an allowable amount of $90 per month.
Past due sums owed on home or car
If you’re behind on any debts secured by your home, car, or other essential
item, you’re allowed an additional deduction equal to the amount necessary
to satisfy this arrearage over 60 months. For example, if you’re $1,500 behind
on your mortgage, you’re allowed a deduction of $25 ($1,500/60) per month
in addition to your regular payment.
84
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Obviously, if passing the Means Test is a concern, it’s better to wait until after
filing bankruptcy to make up your mind on whether you’ll be continuing pay-
ments on secured debts. Don’t surrender your car or allow completion of
foreclosure proceedings without first talking to your lawyer.
How about financing an expensive car on the eve of bankruptcy? Will this
reduce your surplus income and make it easier to pass the Means Test? Yep.
BARF, however, forbids lawyers from telling their clients that information. But
because you’re not our client, and John’s not a lawyer. . . .
Regular payments on vacation homes, recreational vehicles, timeshares, and
similar luxury items aren’t expressly forbidden. Nonetheless, courts will
probably not allow deductions for payments to keep obviously unnecessary
property. Also, deductions for past due payments are limited to debts
secured by essential items.
Unfortunately, if you’ve leased your car, you’re at a serious disadvantage. Car
lease payments are strictly limited under the IRS standards, whereas pay-
ments on financed cars are automatically allowed under specific provisions
of BARF no matter how much they are. Similarly, you may not be allowed an
expense for cable TV, but you’d get an unlimited deduction for payments on a
financed satellite dish.
Payments on priority debts
The most common priority debts are
 Past due support owed to a child, former spouse, or governmental
entity. (See Chapter 17 for more information on marital obligations.)
 Income taxes that are less than three years old, measured from the date
the tax return was due. (See Chapter 15 for more information on taxes.)
 Liabilities for personal injuries caused by drunken driving or boating.
(See Chapter 13.)
You’re entitled to deduct the amount necessary to satisfy these priority debts
over 60 months. So, if you owe $6,000 in back support, you’re allowed an
expense deduction of $100 per month ($6,000/60).
Marital obligations that are really property divisions rather than support
obligations aren’t deductible. (See Chapter 17 for the difference between sup-
port and property divisions.)
The more you owe on priority debts, the easier it is to pass the Means Test.
Talk to your lawyer before making payments on these types of debts. Also,
borrowing money to pay priority debts may be a mistake because payments
on the new loan (if unsecured) is not deductible.

win-win for you.
Figuring Out How Much of Your Debts
You Can Pay
After you figure out whether you have surplus income, the question is
whether you can pay a significant portion of your unsecured, nonpriority
debts. See Table 5-9 to determine whether you could repay a meaningful
amount of your debts. If you can, you flunk the Means Test unless you can
show that because of special circumstances, you really can’t pay a significant
amount of your debts.

You flunk the Means Test unless there are special circumstances.
Passing the Means Test by Showing
“Special Circumstances”
Even if you appear to flunk the Means Test, you can still qualify for Chapter 7
if you convince the court that you have special circumstances, such as a seri-
ous medical condition or a call to active duty in the Armed Forces that justi-
fies additional expenses or adjustments of current monthly income for which
there is no reasonable alternative.
Special circumstances may also be available if you just lost your high-paying
job and for some reason must file bankruptcy immediately. The fact that you
made gobs of money last month doesn’t help you put food on the table today,
so you may be able to convince a judge to allow you to file under Chapter 7
even if you flunk the Means Test.
88
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Considering Ways around the Means Test
BARF mimics the Internal Revenue Code in establishing very specific detailed
rules, which also open loopholes. In our view, debtors should be allowed to
arrange their affairs, and time their bankruptcy filing, so as to best navigate
around these restrictions and take advantage of loopholes, just as corpora-
tions and wealthy individuals typically order their financial affairs to take
advantage of glitches in the tax code. But you still have to tell the truth. Lying
and intentionally concealing information is cheating. And the price for cheat-
ing may be a jail cell. Don’t even think about it.
If it appears that passing the Means Test may be a problem, here are a few
things to discuss with your lawyer:
 BARF doesn’t forbid folks from timing their bankruptcy so that their
average income is as low as possible. If, for example, you just lost your
job, you could wait a few months before filing bankruptcy so that your
average income for the past six months falls below the medians.
 Although large priority debts have to be paid in full over the life of a
Chapter 13 plan, they can actually help you pass the Means Test. But
borrowing money to pay priority debts is usually not a good idea if you
have any concern about passing the Means Test.
 If passing the Means Test is a concern and you don’t have health insur-
ance, this is a good time to sign up because you can deduct actual
amounts paid for health and disability insurance for you and your
dependents.
 If your income exceeds the state median and passing the Means Test is a
concern, you have a better chance of passing if you have high mortgage
and car payments when you file bankruptcy.
 BARF uses medians for families based on how many people live in your
household. The Census Bureau defines household much more broadly
than family. Household consists of all the people who occupy a housing
unit, including “the related family members and all the unrelated people,
if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or employees who share
the housing unit.” Someone living alone in a housing unit, or a group or
unrelated people sharing a housing unit such as partners or roomers, is
also counted as a household. So, a person living alone would be subject
to Means Testing if her monthly income exceeded approximately $2,167.
If another person lived with her, she could not be subjected to Means
Testing unless her monthly income exceeded approximately $3,667.
89
Chapter 5: Confronting the Means Test

 Starting out in Chapter 13 and then converting to Chapter 7 may be one
way to come in through the back door. Courts will probably allow it, if you
show that you tried in good faith to make your Chapter 13 work, but just
couldn’t keep up with payments because of your unique circumstances.
 BARF doesn’t expressly forbid you from reducing income by
• Ceasing to accept support from someone else (for example, a girl-
friend or parent)
• Taking an unpaid leave of absence from work
Getting Kicked Out of Chapter 7 
for Abuse
A provision of BARF allows the court to dismiss your Chapter 7 even if you
pass the Means Test, if it appears that you’re abusing the bankruptcy system.
No one is really clear on how the courts will interpret this provision. Some
courts may conclude that managing your financial affairs in order to squeeze
in under the Means Test amounts to abuse, but just as many might disagree,
taking the view that dismissal for abuse is to be reserved for characters who
are guilty of really, really bad things, such as lying on paperwork or engaging
in some other kind of fraud on the court.
Only time will tell how this one will play out, but your lawyer should have a
pretty good idea of where local judges stand on this issue.

 Comparing the Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 processes
O
kay, you’re thinking that bankruptcy just may be in the cards. What now?
Although it’s a bit of a journey, the process of mapping out your route
and knowing where you’re going need not be an excursion into a dark cave.
Instead, view it as more of a self-guided tour, where you’ve done your home-
work, picked up the latest travelogue, and now you know which routes are
open, which are closed, and which are littered with pot holes and construc-
tion crews. By just taking it one step at a time, you won’t feel so overwhelmed.
Consider this chapter your road map, outlining the route for the two most
common forms of consumer bankruptcy — Chapter 7 liquidations and
Chapter 13 reorganizations — and exposing some goblins and trolls that 
you may encounter along the way.
Navigating the BARF Maze
The credit industry, in drafting BARF, created a number of obstacles to bank-
ruptcy and laid booby traps for folks who don’t successfully negotiate each
and every land mine. One of our goals is to guide you safely over, through,
and around these obstacles.

BARF has the following requirements:
 Within 180 days before bankruptcy, you undergo credit counseling from
an approved agency and obtain a certificate that you’ve done so. If you’ve
got to file immediately and can’t get counseling within five days, you can
catch up within 30 days after filing. Additionally, the court can give you an
additional five days if you really need it. Whether you receive counseling
in person, over the phone, or online, you still need your certificate —
think of it as a diploma — as well as a copy of any repayment plan drawn
up during your counseling session. (See the section “Arranging for Credit
Counseling,” later in this chapter, for more information.)
 Shortly after filing bankruptcy, you must send copies of your most
recent federal income tax returns or official summaries of your returns
(transcripts) to the trustee and to any creditor who requests a copy.
Further, if any creditor or the trustee so requests, you must hand over to
the bankruptcy court all federal income tax returns that you file with the
IRS while your bankruptcy case is open. If you don’t provide copies of
your most recent return, your case can be dismissed. If you don’t give
the bankruptcy court copies of federal returns filed with the IRS while
your case is open, your discharge may be denied, and your debts will
follow you like a shadow. (See the section “Supplying Copies of Tax
Returns,” later in this chapter, for more information.)
 In Chapter 13, prior to the 341 meeting, you also must have filed with the
taxing authorities all the federal, state, and local tax returns that you
should have filed in the past four years. You can get an extension of up
to 120 days. If you don’t comply, your case can be dismissed. (See the
section “Attending the 341 Meeting,” later in this chapter, for more infor-
mation.)
 You must file with the bankruptcy court pay stubs or other evidence 
of income you’ve received in the 60 days prior to bankruptcy. (See the
section “Completing the Paperwork,” later in this chapter, for more 
information.)
 As a condition of having your debts discharged in either a Chapter 7 
or 13, you must, after filing, complete a U.S. Trustee-approved course 
in personal financial management. (See the section “Signing Up for 
Your Financial Management Course,” later in this chapter, for more 
information.)
 Every year in Chapter 13, you are required to submit an updated state-
ment of income and expenses. (See the section “Filing annual reports,”
later in this chapter.)
92
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

The consequence of not filling all your pay stubs for the 60 days prior to
bankruptcy may be catastrophic, even though this omission may seem (and
actually is) a pretty minor mistake. If you don’t, any creditor can demand dis-
missal of your case, and the court — however sympathetic it may be — may
have no choice but to go along. You could go all the way though a bankruptcy
only to find, because of this seemingly trivial error, that you have as many
debts going out as you did going in. Moral of the story: Be extremely careful
and make sure that your lawyer is as well.
Getting Organized Before 
Talking to a Lawyer
Just by reading this book, you’ll by far be better prepared than a typical
bankruptcy client. And although doing some legwork prior to meeting with
your lawyer isn’t required, your initial consultation will go more smoothly
and be more productive if you do.
Doing your financial homework
To the greatest extent possible, calculate
 The amount of any income taxes that you owe and for which years
 How much you’re behind on support obligations
 What your home is worth, the amount you’re behind on mortgages, and
the total balances owed on mortgages
 How much your cars are worth, and the amounts you owe against them
 A rough total of the balances (not monthly payments) that you owe on
all your bills
You also need to gather copies of the following:
 Completed worksheets (tables) from Chapter 2
 Your pay stubs for the past 60 days
 Your mortgage documents
 The certificate of title for any motor vehicles you’re using. If the vehicle
is financed, you’ll have to request a copy from the lender.
93
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

 Your most recent income tax return
 Any court papers if a lawsuit is pending against you
 Any divorce decrees, support orders, or marital settlement agreements
 Any information you provided to, or received from, a credit counseling
agency within the past 180 days
In addition, Table 6-1 features some simple questions that your lawyer will
ask. Check the appropriate box for each question and bring a copy of this
checklist with you for your lawyer to review.

Tracking down your creditors
If you’re unsure who all you owe money to, you need to obtain copies of your
credit reports. For under $10, depending on where you live, you can order
your credit report from
 Equifax, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; phone, 800-685-1111;
Web site, www.equifax.com
 Experian, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; phone, 800-682-7654; Web site,
www.experian.com
 Trans Union, P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022; phone, 800-851-2674; Web
site, www.transunion.com
You can also obtain a free credit report from any of these agencies when you
request it within 60 days after being denied credit because of a bad report
from that company. Sometimes, people apply for a loan knowing that they’ll
be turned down so that they can receive a free copy of their credit report.
96
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

However, they receive only a copy of the report that was used to deny their
loan application, not all three reports, so the document is of limited value.
Under the recently enacted the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act
(FACTA), consumers may obtain a free copy of their credit report once every
12 months. Go to www.annualcreditreport.com to request your free
credit report. To request the report by phone or mail, call 877-322-8228 (toll
free) or write to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,
Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.
Some creditors may report to one or two of the credit bureaus, but not all
three. So ordering a credit report from only one company isn’t enough. For
about $35, you can obtain a merged credit report, combining information
from Equifax, Experian, and Trans Union with addresses for creditors, from
 Coast to Coast Information Services, 800-877-4033, www.fullcredit
reports.com
 True Credit, 800-493-2392, www.truecredit.com
Bear in mind that the only creditors who appear on a credit report are the
ones that have reported you. These creditors generally include credit-card
companies, major department stores, and other large institutional creditors.
Smaller creditors — such as your doctor, landlord, or local grocery store —
rarely report to the credit bureaus until and unless the account is turned
over to a collection agency.
Many bankruptcy lawyers are hooked up to an online service that allows
them to get information similar to that provided by credit reports and down-
load it directly into official bankruptcy forms. The service charges about $50
per credit report. Although this service can be a great time-saver, neither you
nor your lawyer should rely exclusively on this method. Rather, it should be
used to supplement the information you can obtain by yourself. As we said,
not all creditors report to credit bureaus, and the addresses listed in these
credit reports may not be the addresses that BARF requires.
Whenever you contact creditors or credit bureaus that don’t know your
whereabouts or phone number, try not to provide that information. Doing 
so may just give them what they need to hound you for payment.
If, within 90 days prior to bankruptcy, a creditor has sent two or more 
communications to you that specify an address for correspondence and a
current account number, you should list that address and account number 
on your bankruptcy paperwork. Otherwise, the automatic stay (see the 
section “Using the Automatic Stay”) may not apply to that creditor.
97
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

Meeting Your Lawyer for the First Time
Reputable bankruptcy lawyers have different styles of practice, and one isn’t
necessarily better than the other. Some handle a high volume of cases on an
assembly line basis, relying heavily on paralegals. Others opt for a lower
volume of cases with more personal contact between lawyer and client. Go
with whichever makes you more comfortable.
Lawyers who specialize in personal bankruptcy are usually more efficient and
tend to charge less and do a better job that lawyers who just file an occa-
sional bankruptcy case.
By reading this book and being prepared, you aren’t the typical bankruptcy
client — especially if you’re willing to pay a lawyer’s hourly fee just to get an
unbiased assessment of your options. If you explain how you’ve done your
homework when calling for an appointment, even a high-volume office needs
to alter its procedures so that you can meet with the lawyer who is in charge
of your case, rather than a nonlawyer intake person. If not, you may want to
consider looking elsewhere.
In your first meeting, the lawyer — after reviewing the materials you bring in
and asking questions — must be able to tell you whether bankruptcy is your
best choice and, if so, which type. If you answered yes to any of the questions
in Table 5-1 (earlier in the chapter), expect the lawyer to inquire further. If he
doesn’t, you want to be sure to bring up any issues.
Arranging for Credit Counseling
BARF requires that you obtain a certificate from an approved credit counsel-
ing agency that documents that you received counseling within 180 days of
filing bankruptcy. But wait until you talk to your lawyer (who can tell what
your best local options are) before deciding whether to go for in-person
counseling or doing it electronically and what materials you need to submit
to the agency.

Keys to spotting a good bankruptcy attorney
A good bankruptcy attorney must, of course,
know the law, but she must also be willing to
spend the time and effort to learn about your par-
ticular situation and thoughtfully assess your
options. Run for the nearest exit if the lawyer (or
worse, her paralegal) says that your case is “cut
and dried” or “run of the mill.” For a conscien-
tious lawyer, there really is no such thing. Every
case has at least a few unique features to it.

Completing the Paperwork
After you decide to file bankruptcy, you’ll have to provide information for the
official documents. Some law offices give you a questionnaire to complete at
home. Others help you fill it out on the spot, possibly with the assistance of a
paralegal. Either way is fine as long as the information is accurate.
Receiving and reviewing drafts of official documents is a must. We recom-
mend taking the drafts home and going over them very carefully at your own
speed. Although documents can be amended after they’re filed, your lawyer
may charge you for the extra work. Remember, you’ve got to get it right.
Mistakes may come back to haunt you.
One in every 250 bankruptcy cases will be audited, and yours could be the
one. If significant mistakes are found, your discharge may be revoked, and
your debts reinstated. If you intentionally misrepresent something, you may
face criminal prosecution as well.
Filing Your Bankruptcy Case
When your paperwork is complete, your lawyer makes a strategic decision
on when to actually file the papers with the court. This petition date deter-
mines which debts and property are included in your bankruptcy and which
aren’t. Tactical considerations in deciding whether to file this week or next
may come into play. For example, if you recently lost your job, you may want
to delay bankruptcy for several months to lower your average income for the
past six months, making it easier to pass the Means Test. Your lawyer can
help you with that determination.
In any case, the instant that your papers are filed, the pressure should be 
off. No more calls from debt collectors. No more collection efforts. You don’t
have to dread answering the phone any more. An automatic stay (see the
next section) kicks in and, when it does, you’ll finally see a glimmer of light 
at the end of your tunnel of financial distress.
Using the Automatic Stay
The automatic stay is one of the more powerful tools of bankruptcy. It kicks in
automatically when you file, and results in a federal court order forbidding
creditors from taking any action against you without first going through the
judge. The judge literally makes a federal case against anyone who ignores
the protective stay and comes after you.
99
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

Sometimes, however, a glitch may occur because the court doesn’t notify
creditors of your bankruptcy until about ten days after it’s filed. So, what if a
creditor doesn’t know that you’ve filed and repossesses your car?
Your attorney can probably get your car back, but doing so is likely to be an
unnecessary hassle and expense. You can avoid this headache simply by
informing any creditor who’s likely to take immediate action that you’ve filed
bankruptcy. That way, if they violate the automatic stay, they may have to
pay you damages and reimburse your attorney fees. As we mention in the
earlier section “Tracking down your creditors,” BARF requires that if a credi-
tor has contacted you at least twice during the 90 days prior to bankruptcy,
you must list the address and account number indicated in this correspon-
dence when you fill out the bankruptcy paperwork. If you use some other
address or don’t include the correct account number, you may not be able to
recover money damages from that creditor if it violates the automatic stay.
If you’re in default on your car loan, we suggest that you don’t notify the
creditor until after you actually file bankruptcy. Otherwise, the lender may
attempt to grab the car before the automatic stay takes effect.
After your petition is filed
 If a foreclosure sale is scheduled, personally attend and announce that
you’ve filed bankruptcy and that the sale cannot legally continue. Bring
a copy of your petition just in case anyone insists on verification.
 Contact anyone who’s suing you and send a copy of the bankruptcy peti-
tion to any court where you’re being sued.
 If your wages are being garnished from your paycheck, be sure to notify
your employer about your bankruptcy so that no more money comes
out of your paycheck. Antidiscrimination laws prohibit your employer
from taking any action against you simply because you filed bankruptcy.

Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
Warning aggressive creditors that you’ve filed
Dan phoned the finance company and left a
message that he’d just filed bankruptcy. Any
finance company should, and would, know that
a bankruptcy filing immediately stops all collec-
tion efforts.
But somehow, Dan’s message got lost, and that
night, the company repossessed his car. When
it refused to immediately return the vehicle, Dan
asked for help from the bankruptcy court. The
judge not only ordered the return of the car but
also fined the finance company and made it pay
Dan’s legal fees.

Exceptions to the automatic stay
The automatic stay is a tremendous shield, but it isn’t entirely bulletproof. It
won’t protect you from
 Criminal prosecution. Filing bankruptcy won’t prevent you from being
tried, convicted, and sent to jail if you’ve committed a crime.
 Repossession of personal property where the creditor has a purchase
money security interest (for example, your car loan), or where the per-
sonal property is leased if you haven’t entered into a reaffirmation agree-
ment within 30 days of the 341 meeting. See Chapter 11.
 Evictions if a judgment for possession has already been entered by a
state court and state law says that it’s too late to reinstate the lease. If
you’re being evicted or threatened with eviction, see a bankruptcy
lawyer immediately. Timing is everything.
 Deductions from your pay or pension to make regular payments on a
loan against your retirement plan.
 Collection of child support or alimony, or even modifications of those
support orders.
 Proceedings to dissolve a marriage, provided that there is no property
to divide.
 Proceedings to establish your paternity.
 Government regulatory matters . . . as long as they aren’t an end run to
collect on a prepetition debt.
Plenty of states automatically suspend your driver’s license when you fail to
pay a judgment stemming from a car crash. The aim, obviously, is collecting
money from you, so the automatic stay therefore applies.
On the other hand, licensing requirements that are designed to protect the
public from incompetent nurses, doctors, architects, lawyers, accountants,
and so on are not designed primarily to collect revenue. Consequently, the
automatic stay won’t stop the state from revoking your professional license
when you’ve somehow managed to commit malpractice or violate the stan-
dards of your profession.
Situations where the automatic stay does
not apply due to a prior bankruptcy
The automatic stay is really not so automatic if you’ve had a previous bank-
ruptcy dismissed (for a reason other than flunking the Means Test) within a
year of refiling under the following rules:
101
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

 If you had one bankruptcy dismissed less than one year before filing a
new bankruptcy, the automatic stay kicks in when the case is filed, but it
expires in 30 days unless you persuade the court that it should remain in
effect.
 If you had more than one bankruptcy dismissed within the year before
filing a new case, you have to file a special request for the court to
impose the stay.
 If you had a bankruptcy dismissed within the past 180 days because you
willfully disobeyed a court order or requested dismissal after a creditor
asked for relief from stay, no stay goes into effect.
You may wonder what you must do to convince a judge to resurrect the stay
if you have to refile within one year of dismissal. Good question.
BARF provides that if your case was dismissed for failing to file documents,
you must show a substantial excuse, not just negligence or inadvertence. If
your earlier case was dismissed because you couldn’t keep up with your plan
payments, you have to prove that circumstances have changed, and now
you’re able to make payments. Undoubtedly, your chances of success
depends on the attitudes and prejudices of local bankruptcy judges, which
may be wildly divergent.
Real abusers — in rem orders
Prior to BARF, some debtors thwarted legitimate foreclosure proceedings by
repeatedly filing and then dismissing Chapter 13 cases — a practice that is
truly abusive.
The new law authorizes the bankruptcy court to enter an in rem order, which
provides that any future bankruptcy filed within two years will not interfere
with foreclosure proceedings. This order isn’t a bad idea, and some courts
were doing that before BARF.
102
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 
Taking quick action to save your driver’s license
When the state tried to suspend Felicity’s driver’s
license for not paying a judgment in a lawsuit
over an automobile crash, she had her lawyer
immediately file a bankruptcy petition. The auto-
matic stay stopped the license suspension pro-
ceedings so that Felicity could continue to drive.
Smart move.
Had Felicity waited until her license actually was
suspended before she filed her bankruptcy peti-
tion, she wouldn’t have been able to drive until
after the bankruptcy discharge was entered and
her license was formally reinstated.

For spouses and relatives
The automatic stay protects pretty much only you and your property. It
won’t, for example, stop foreclosure on your grandfather’s house or preclude
repossession of your spouse’s car, if he doesn’t also file bankruptcy.
However, if you have even a partial ownership interest in an asset, the stay
may very well apply.
Some sleazebags have abused the automatic stay by transferring partial own-
ership interests to a number of pals or siblings. That way, whenever repos-
session or foreclosure is on the horizon, one of them files bankruptcy just
long enough for the automatic stay to take effect and then promptly gets the
bankruptcy dismissed. The next time creditors get antsy, another “owner”
files and does the same thing. This tactic is crummy, and courts are becom-
ing not only willing but also seemingly eager to impose some pretty nasty
fines on people who do it. If you ever decide to play this game, well, don’t 
say we didn’t warn you.
For cosigned debts
Ordinarily, the automatic stay in your case wouldn’t prevent a creditor from
going after someone who cosigned a loan for you.
You can, however, protect cosigners when filing under Chapter 13, if your
plan proposes paying off the cosigned debt in full (although over an extended
period of time). Known as the codebtor stay, it may be just the ticket to pro-
tect your sister, cousin, mother-in-law, rabbi, or whoever else may have
cosigned for your loan.
Receiving Notice of the 
Creditors’ Meeting
Within about ten days after the filing of your bankruptcy petition, the court
sends notice to all of your creditors (using the address you provided in your
schedules), informing them of your case, announcing the appointment of a
case trustee (who represents the interests of the creditors), and setting the
date for a meeting with creditors (the so-called 341 meeting).
Supplying Copies of Tax Returns
At least seven days before the 341 meeting, you must send copies of your
most recent federal tax return (or an official summary known as a transcript)
103
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

to the case trustee and any creditor who requests a copy. If you don’t meet
this deadline, the case may be dismissed.
In Chapter 13, prior to the 341 meeting, you also must have filed with federal,
state, and local taxing authorities all of the tax returns that should have been
filed in the past four years. Again, if you fail to comply, your case can be dis-
missed. However, you may get an extension of up to 120 days to file these
returns.
If any creditor or the trustee so requests, you must hand over to the bank-
ruptcy court any federal tax returns filed with the IRS while the case is open.
A Chapter 7 debtor’s discharge may be denied for failure to file tax returns
with the court. Also, a Chapter 13 plan may be dismissed if tax returns are
not filed with the court.
Attending the 341 Meeting
The one and only time in most bankruptcies where you and your creditors
might come face to face is at what is called the 341 meeting. Named for a sec-
tion of the Bankruptcy Code, this session is sometimes referred to as the First
Meeting of Creditors. That’s kind of a misnomer because creditors almost
never show up and there’s rarely a “second” meeting.
The 341 meetings are generally open to the public, although it’s unlikely that
anyone would attend just out of idle curiosity. However, you might think
about attending a couple just to watch the process unfold. Call either the
bankruptcy court or the U.S. Trustee’s office to find out when and where 341
meetings are held. Chapter 7 meetings are somewhat different than Chapter
13 meetings, so make sure that you check out the type of meeting that will be
held in your case.
Signing Up for Your Financial
Management Course
As a condition of getting your debts wiped out in either Chapter 7 or Chapter
13, you must complete an approved course in personal financial management
after you file bankruptcy, but before your case is closed. The sooner you get
started, the better. In Chapter 7, you have to complete the course within
about 60 days of the 341 meeting. You have more time in Chapter 13, but
104
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

there is not reason to delay. The Coalition for Consumer Bankruptcy Debtor
Education is one of the few organizations offering quality debtor education.
Check them out at www.debtoreducation.org.
Working Your Way through Chapter 7
The first thing that happens in Chapter 7 is the 341 meeting with creditors,
which usually takes place 20 to 40 days after filing. The trustee conducts this
meeting that you and your lawyer must attend.
Local practice may require that you bring certain things, such as bank state-
ments, pay stubs, income tax returns, car titles, and the like to the meeting,
but ideally you’ve already provided your lawyer with all these materials, and
he just has to bring copies for the trustee.
In addition, you must bring a photo ID, as well as proof of your Social
Security number.
The 341 meeting in a Chapter 7 case
At the 341 meeting, the trustee asks whether you were honest in listing all your
assets on your bankruptcy petition and whether you have any nonexempt
property that can be sold off to satisfy creditors. The trustee may also inquire
about any payments you made or property that you transferred before bank-
ruptcy. She won’t browbeat you for filing or try to embarrass you. Humiliating
you isn’t her job or her purpose. You can expect to encounter a professional
person acting professionally.
Whenever creditors show up, which is rare, they’re permitted to ask a few
polite questions, but they won’t be allowed to harass you or put you down.
Keep in mind that the purpose of the meeting is strictly “just the facts,
ma’am” informational. You don’t have to explain yourself or justify your
spending.
Although attending a 341 meeting is not an act of penance, you still want to
keep on your toes.
Keep in mind that getting rid of debt that you rack up knowing full well that
you won’t be able to pay may be difficult. Sometimes a creditor pretends to
be sympathetic, trying to lead you down the path of admitting that you knew
you couldn’t pay the debt when you incurred it. Don’t ever let anybody put
105
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

words in your mouth! If you thought that you’d be able to pay or just didn’t
realize how bad things were, stick to your guns. Don’t admit to things that
aren’t true just to be helpful or agreeable. Damning admissions can inspire
creditors to file papers attempting to prevent that debt from being dis-
charged on the basis of fraud (see Chapter 16).
Moreover, the trustee asks questions to find out whether you meet local
requirements for exemptions that you claimed. You’ll probably be quizzed
about
 The value of your home, and whether you actually live there
 Whether you actually use tools in your trade or business
 The value of your car
 Your pension plan
Whether you’re asked about your pension plan depends on where you live.
Your lawyer should anticipate these questions and review them with you
ahead of time.
Whenever you have nonexempt assets, the trustee usually inquires if you’d
be willing to pay her the value of the asset so that you can keep it. Say, for
example, that you owned a personal watercraft worth $1,500. The trustee
would ask you if you’d rather pay $1,500 or surrender it. If you decide to keep
it, payments may be stretched out over a few months.
If you can’t or don’t want to buy back nonexempt assets, the trustee arranges
to have them picked up for liquidation. In the case of real estate, she hires a
real estate agent who then inspects the property and comes to an indepen-
dent opinion as to its value. The trustee then decides whether to have the
real estate agent offer the property for sale.
This applies only to nonexempt property and not your home if it’s fully
exempt.
The trustee may also make arrangements to receive your income tax refund
for the current year or request additional information about your assets, pay-
ments, or recent transfers of property. Your lawyer usually can handle these
issues simply by sending a letter addressing any unresolved questions.
Sometimes, a second meeting is necessary, but that’s a rarity.
In the majority of cases, the trustee quickly concludes that you don’t have
enough nonexempt assets to bother with and declares your matter a no-asset
case. In these cases, your involvement with the trustee usually ends at the
conclusion of the 341 meeting.
106
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Dealing with secured creditors
Aside from dealing with the trustee, you also must make arrangements with
secured creditors within 30 days after the 341 meeting. You may
 Surrender collateral
 Redeem some kinds of personal property
 Reaffirm the secured debt
 Use avoidance powers to eliminate liens
In Chapter 13, if you intend to keep personal property that is either leased or
subject to a purchase money security interest, you must provide the creditor
with proof that you have insurance on the item within 60 days of the petition
date. See Chapter 11 for a more in-depth look at secured debts and ways to
deal with them.
Amending paperwork
If you discover that you’ve made inadvertent mistakes in the paperwork, the
earlier you correct them, the better. Telling the trustee about errors is essen-
tial. However, when addressing a significant error, merely telling the trustee
isn’t enough. If you discover significant errors, you need to file a formal
amendment so that the court’s records show you’ve been forthright and
truthful. Your attorney probably will charge you extra to amend your paper-
work, but getting it right is crucial.
Check out Chapter 19 to get an idea of what types of errors may be consid-
ered significant enough to require formal amendment to your papers.
Adding creditors
The general rule is that debts that aren’t listed on your official bankruptcy
paperwork aren’t wiped out. But you still can add them after you’ve filed, if
you do so promptly — and the sooner, the better. Making additions to your
list of debts within 30 days after the 341 meeting is preferable, and it’s essen-
tial within 90 days if assets will be available to creditors in your case. (See
Chapter 13 for more information about dealing with unlisted creditors.)
107
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

Sweating out key deadlines
The Bankruptcy Code mercifully establishes three deadlines, and you can
breathe easier after they pass:
 Within ten days after the 341 meeting: The United States Trustee must
file a statement with the court as to whether you passed or flunked the
Means Test. If the U.S. Trustee thinks you flunked, she must, within 30
days of filing the statement, ask the court to dismiss your case.
 Thirty days after the 341 meeting concludes: The 30th day is the last
day for the trustee or creditors to object to your claims of exempt prop-
erty. If you’ve properly listed the asset, you’re in the clear after that
time. But if you have to amend an exemption claim, the 30-day clock
starts running all over again.
 Sixty days after the 341 meeting: The 60th day is the deadline for credi-
tors to claim that certain types of debts — most notably credit-card
fraud claims and nonsupport marital obligations — should not be wiped
out. If the creditor fails to file in time, it’s too late, and you’re home-free.
The same deadline applies to claims that your discharge should be
denied altogether because of serious misconduct.
Attending a discharge hearing
Usually, you have to attend a discharge hearing only if you want to reaffirm a
debt and your lawyer refused to sign a statement that reaffirmation is in your
best interest. Understand that your lawyer’s refusal isn’t to be mean. She’s
actually trying to look out for your best interest despite your desires. At the
discharge hearing, the judge makes sure that you really understand the con-
sequences of reaffirming a debt and can afford to make the payments on the
reaffirmed debt.
Closing no-asset cases
Most no-asset cases close about 60 days after the 341 meeting. At that point,
you’re done. All assets that you listed on your schedules are yours again
when the case is closed.
108
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

Administering asset cases
Asset cases remain open long enough for the trustee to liquidate your nonex-
empt assets, distribute the proceeds to creditors, and file a report with the
court. If the trustee can’t sell an asset, she abandons it, which means that
you own it again.
This whole process is referred to as the administration of the estate, and
sometimes it takes quite a while — sometimes even years, depending on the
kind of assets that are involved.
If someone owed you money on the petition date, the trustee can sue that
person to collect it. If you already were in the process of suing someone, the
trustee takes over the case. All these steps take time, and courts are pretty
indulgent in giving trustees all the time they need.
Even though an asset case can drag on, your discharge (assuming that there
are no complications; see the next section for details) still will be entered
approximately 60 days after the 341 meeting. Still, you must cooperate with
the trustee in her efforts to convert assets to cash.
Fortunately, fewer than 5 percent of Chapter 7 filings are assets cases.
109
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process
Laying the foundation for credit repair
Sooner or later, you’re going to want to repair
your credit rating — and there’s no time like the
present for getting started. You can do a number
of things right now that make the going easier
down the road.
For example, some banks won’t allow a recent
bankruptcy filer to open a checking account. You
can avoid this hassle by opening a new account
before bankruptcy at a bank where you don’t owe
any money. Just deposit the minimum amount
and don’t use the account until after you file.
You may also want to consider getting a new
credit card or a charge account. Although it may
seem that there’s nothing you need less than
more credit, getting a new account is a step
toward rebuilding your credit, and doing it prior
to filing bankruptcy may be easier and cleaner.
Be sure to accurately list all your debts and
assets on any application, and if you succeed in
getting a credit or charge card, don’t use it until
after you file. If you don’t owe money on an
account, you won’t need to list it on your bank-
ruptcy petition. Chances are the creditor won’t
cancel your card, and you’ll be able to use the
new account to begin restoring your credit his-
tory in the future.

Anticipating complications
Not every Chapter 7 is routine, however, and complications sometimes
develop. The good news is that an experienced bankruptcy lawyer usually
can tell, even before filing, whether possible problems are lurking on the hori-
zon. If you’ve been completely candid with your lawyer, and she’s not wor-
ried about any potential glitches, you needn’t worry either.
Working Your Way through Chapter 13
Aside from the obvious fact that you’ll be making payments for the next 36 to
60 months, when filing a Chapter 13 reorganization, you have a few extra hur-
dles to jump. Procedural requirements are designed to ensure that your plan
is feasible, that it satisfies certain technical mandates, and that you do the
best you can to repay creditors.
Filing your plan and beginning 
your payments
Although you have 15 days after your petition is filed to submit your payment
plan, having it ready when you file is a better idea. Your first plan payment 
is due within 30 days, and it may come due even before you meet with the
trustee. One concern of the trustee is whether you’re willing and able to
make timely plan payments. Missing the first payment makes for a dreadful
start. Your lawyer should tell you how and where to make plan payments.
The 341 meeting in a Chapter 13 case
Many aspects of the 341 meeting with creditors are the same in Chapter 13 as
they are in Chapter 7 cases, but the emphasis is different and some additional
concerns exist. (For more on Chapter 7 filings, see the section “Working Your
Way through Chapter 7,” earlier in this chapter.)
The Chapter 13 trustee scrutinizes your income and expense shown on your
bankruptcy paperwork to see whether you are
 Likely to meet your monthly payment obligations. You probably won’t
be able to keep up with payments if you haven’t been realistic in esti-
mating your living expenses.
110
Part I: Bankruptcy: The Big Picture 

 Making a good faith effort to repay your creditors as much as reasonably
possible. The trustee questions you to make sure that you listed all your
sources of income and carefully reviews your proposed expenses.
In areas where the local practice is to conduct confirmation hearings (see the
next section) immediately after the 341 meeting, more creditors may attend
and ask questions along the same line as those just listed. In other locations,
most creditors do not attend 341 meeting.
Confirming your repayment plan
The court decides whether to approve or reject your repayment plan at
what’s called the confirmation hearing.
In many places, if the trustee supports your plan and your creditors have no
objections, you don’t have to appear at the confirmation hearing, and the
court will probably approve your proposal as a matter of course.
But whenever the trustee or a creditor objects, you and your lawyer have to
attend. Your lawyer determines whether to proceed with a hearing and tries
to convince the judge that the objections have no merit or tries negotiating
with objecting creditors. If the court upholds any objection to your plan,
you’ll probably have an opportunity to file a modified plan and schedule
another confirmation hearing. Occasionally, the judge concludes that the
objection is so serious that any attempted plan modification would be futile
and simply orders that the case be dismissed.
Going through valuation hearings
Another type of hearing known as a valuation hearing is where secured 
creditors can object to how they’re being treated under your plan because
the value of their collateral is different than you claim. Your lawyer usually
can resolve valuation issues through negotiation, but, if that fails, the judge
decides.
Filing annual reports
Every year that you’re in Chapter 13, you must file an updated statement 
with the court showing your income and expenses for the past year. The first
one is due 90 days after the close of the first tax year you are in Chapter 13.
Subsequent reports are due no later than 45 days before the anniversary date
of the plan’s confirmation. Your lawyer can help you complete these reports.
111
Chapter 6: Getting from Here to There: The Bankruptcy Process

Looking at the claims process
Whenever any creditors are entitled to receive money from your bankruptcy —
that is, if you filed a Chapter 13 or a Chapter 7 asset case — be sure that the
money goes toward satisfying debts that won’t be discharged or that will con-
tinue to linger because of a lien.
For example, if you file Chapter 13 to catch up on your back mortgage pay-
ments, you want the money you pay to the trustee to be used for this pur-
pose — not toward payment of debts that will just be eliminated.
But remember that a creditor can’t receive any money from a bankruptcy
estate unless a document called a proof of claim is filed with the court. Most
creditors have 90 days from the 341 meeting to file such a claim. If the credi-
tor doesn’t file one, you can lodge a proof of claim on behalf of the creditor
up to 120 days from the 341 meeting.
Governmental units get special treatment and are afforded 180 days after the
petition date to file a proof of claim.
Certain taxes are priority debts. These taxes, which ordinarily would be
nondischargeable, can be wiped out in Chapter 13 whenever the taxing
authority doesn’t file a timely proof of claim. (Obviously, you don’t want to
file a proof of claim for these debts.)

ith a new bankruptcy law in October 2005, it’s
tougher than ever to figure out whether bank-
ruptcy spells relief for you. If you think another alterna-

to fully understand the downsides of bankruptcy. In this
part, we offer a crash course in successful sparring with
debt-collection bullies — to keep them at bay while you
make up your mind — and some tips on negotiating the

B
ankruptcy is a fantastically powerful tool for financial rebirth, and one
that never should be viewed only as a last resort. Bankruptcy is a tool
at your disposal, and you need to measure its usefulness by the simplest 
of criteria: Do the benefits outweigh the disadvantages? Too many people
comply with the advice of less-than-objective debt counselors and sincere-
but-ignorant friends and relatives, parting with essential assets like their
homes and pensions, only to wind up in bankruptcy (where those kinds of
assets may have been protected) anyhow.
But bankruptcy isn’t necessarily the best or even the only solution for you.
Filing bankruptcy has definite downsides, and sometimes a different strategy
is more appropriate for your situation or your personality.
In this chapter, we look at some of the pitfalls of bankruptcy and the alterna-
tives, such as using your home equity or pension to pay your debts.

Appreciating the Negative Consequences
of Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy isn’t without consequences, and some of them can be painful.
You need to fully appreciate what you have to lose if you file bankruptcy, and
what you stand to lose if you file at the wrong time.
The drawbacks of bankruptcy
Although the drawbacks frequently are exaggerated, filing bankruptcy can
(note we say “can” and not “will”)
 Hurt innocent people who extended you credit.
 Damage your credit rating.
 Represent the ultimate admission of financial defeat.
 Result in pubic humiliation in communities where newspapers print the
names of bankruptcy filers. (Because of the sheer volume, however,
many newspapers now limit those listings to businesses and prominent
individuals.)
 Subject your personal lifestyle to scrutiny in a public meeting room
(rarely, however, do any curiosity-seekers show up).
 Be used against you by prospective employers, particularly if your
career involves being bonded (bank teller, jewelry associate, and so on).
 Cause you to lose some of your belongings.
 Preclude bankruptcy as an avenue of relief if you get in even worse trou-
ble in the near future.
Reasons not to file bankruptcy
Bankruptcy may be the wrong solution for you if
 Your debts are small enough that you can probably pay them off in full
in a few years without too much trouble.
 You don’t owe the money. Just because someone says you owe him
money doesn’t necessarily mean that you do. If you sincerely believe 
the debt is an error, and can prove it, fight.
118
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

 You won’t be able to shed your most nettlesome debts by filing.
Bankruptcy won’t eliminate all your debts. Criminal fines, student loans,
most taxes, support obligations, and personal injuries caused by drunk
driving usually can’t be wiped out in bankruptcy.
 You have valuable nonexempt assets that can be taken to satisfy credi-
tors, and you don’t want to risk losing them.
 Your goal is just to delay a creditor or jerk him around.
 Your biggest debts are secured (by your house or car, for example), and
your unsecured debts are relatively insignificant.
 You have transferred property to or put title in someone else’s name to
keep it away from creditors.
Reasons to delay filing bankruptcy
Sometimes a successful bankruptcy depends on careful timing. Your lawyer
may suggest that you wait if you
 Expect to receive a large income tax refund. If you file before receiving
the windfall, the money goes toward paying your debts. But if you wait
until after you receive your refund, you’ll be able to spend it on essen-
tials (like car or house repairs) before filing.
 Racked up quite a bit of debt recently. If you wait for a while to file bank-
ruptcy, it will be less likely that creditors would claim fraud and try to
prevent elimination of these debts. See Chapters 14 and 16.
 Repaid debts to family members during the past year. If you wait for a
year to expire after paying debts to family members, you protect them
from having to cough up this money to a bankruptcy trustee. See
Chapter 19.
 Recently suffered a reduction in your income, or expect to in the near
future. Remember that the Means Test is only a problem for folks with
incomes over the median, and this calculation is based on your average
income for the six months preceding bankruptcy. If, for example, you
just lost a high-paying job, your average income would decrease for
every month you did not receive a paycheck. So, delaying your bank-
ruptcy for several months would reduce your average monthly income
and minimize any Means Test problems. See Chapter 5.
 Filed bankruptcy before. Your debts won’t be wiped out in a Chapter 7
filed within eight years of a prior case or in a Chapter 13 filed within four
years of a previous bankruptcy. See Chapter 4.
119
Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

 Are facing large medical bills in the foreseeable future. Remember that if
you file bankruptcy, you won’t be able to file another one anytime soon.
See preceding bullet.
 Are contemplating divorce. Deciding exactly when to file bankruptcy
when a divorce is looming is devilishly tricky. See Chapters 5 and 17.
 Owned your home for less than 1,215 days and live in a state that allows
a generous homestead exemption. See Chapter 12 and Appendix A. BARF
imposes a $125,000 limit on homesteads acquired within 1,215 days of
bankruptcy, even if your state would allow more. In this situation, you
might want to delay your bankruptcy for 1,215 days. Say, for example,
that you live in Massachusetts and inherited a home worth $350,000.
Your home is completely off-limits to creditors unless you file bank-
ruptcy within 1,215 days of acquiring it, in which case only $125,000
would be protected. What a different a day could make!
 Owe taxes that wouldn’t be dischargeable if you filed bankruptcy right
now, but would become dischargeable in the near future.
Looking at Remedies Other 
Than Bankruptcy
You don’t swat a fly with a sledgehammer or use a wrench to drive in a nail —
or at least you shouldn’t. By the same token, you don’t need to file bank-
ruptcy just to solve a trivial financial problem or when a more targeted
remedy is available. Although you never should view bankruptcy as a last-
ditch solution, you probably shouldn’t make it your first consideration either.
If you can get out of trouble without filing, that’s wonderful! In fact, this sec-
tion explains a number of things that you may want to consider before decid-
ing that bankruptcy is the way out.
Budgeting
If you can get your financial house in order through discipline and careful
budgeting, go for it. The key to realistic budgeting is establishing a reason-
able timeframe for immediate and long-term goals and adopting a positive
attitude that focuses not on what you’re giving up but rather on what you’re
achieving.
You may also consider looking into an Employee Assistance Program (EAP), 
if your employer offers one. These plans provide counseling for a variety of
120
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

issues, including debt problems. The EAP may also suggest ways that your
company credit union can help. However, you always need to be leery of
attempting to borrow your way out of debt. It’s kind of like those diet plans
that claim you can eat your way thin.
Allowing your family to bail you out
Frequently, a parent or other family member offers to save your hide, and
accepting that generosity often is tempting. Allowing your family to bail you
out may be a wise alternative to bankruptcy, but only if your Guardian Angel
 Is ready, willing, and able to help.
 Can pay your debts without suffering financial hardship himself.
 Can truly solve your problem, not just postpone an inevitable bank-
ruptcy. Loaning or giving money to a loved one to relieve the immediate
pressure is common, but such actions ultimately are a waste of money
when you end up in bankruptcy anyway. The money is gone, the gesture
was futile, and far too often, bad feelings linger.
Selling your assets
If you own assets that you’d lose to a bankruptcy trustee, you may want to
consider selling your stuff to pay your debts. If that doesn’t raise enough
money to pay all your debts, it at least helps whittle down your debt load.
Every state has laws that make certain essential assets exempt or off-limits to
creditors, regardless of whether the debtor files bankruptcy. Note that we’re
talking about selling nonexempt assets — those that a creditor can get. Don’t
let anyone bully you into selling exempt assets, which in most cases are off-
limits even if you don’t file bankruptcy. Most states allow you to keep
 Homesteads up to a specified value
 Pensions
 Basic household furnishings
 A modest vehicle
Practically speaking, here’s how exemptions work. Say your home is worth
$100,000, and your mortgage(s) total $80,000. The equity in your home is
$20,000. If the homestead exemption for your state is $25,000, the only credi-
tors who can take your home are the ones holding your mortgages. The law
121
Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

says that your home is yours — unless you agree otherwise by getting
another mortgage or borrowing more on your present one. In other words,
selling exempt assets to pay debts is rarely a good idea. Actually, it’s often
downright foolish.
When selling assets, you need to
 Sell the asset for a fair price. If you sell to someone you know, be pre-
pared to show how you determined the price.
 Avoid repaying debts to friends or relatives if there’s any possibility of
bankruptcy.
 Tell your bankruptcy lawyer when you’ve sold assets (actually, it would
be better to tell him beforehand if possible) and be sure that the sale is
mentioned in your bankruptcy paperwork.
Some department stores take a security interest in items that you purchase on
their charge accounts. In practical terms, that means you aren’t supposed to
part with an item you’ve charged before you fully own it. But if you’ve already
sold it, it’s probably not a big deal if you didn’t know any better.
Keep in mind that the law does not require you to strip yourself of key assets
to satisfy creditors. (We describe such exemptions in detail in Part III.) You
need somewhere to live. You may need a car. Someday you’ll need a pension.
Bankruptcy protects all those things.
Transferring credit-card balances
Although trading high interest rates for lower rates is worth checking out,
credit-card balance transfers seldom are effective. A balance transfer actually
is a new loan, with the proceeds going to pay debts that should be pretty far
down on your list of priorities. Furthermore, whenever you transfer a balance
and then end up in bankruptcy, you may be facing an allegation of fraud, and
your creditors may fight to prevent the debts you owe them from being
wiped out.
If you do decide to shop around, a Web site at www.getsmart.com can help
you find a more favorable credit-card rate. Another Web site, www.bankrate.
com, also provides useful information about credit-card rates and mortgage
rates.
Keep in mind, however, that creditors have ulterior motives. Even when
monthly payments are lower, the longer the creditors continue collecting
interest, the more money you’ll ultimately pay.
122
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Restructuring home mortgages
You may be able to free up some cash by restructuring your home mortgage.
Basically, you can do this in two ways:
 By arranging a mortgage workout agreement
 By refinancing
If a foreclosure sale is scheduled, keep your eye on that date and, if possible,
try to get it postponed. When such a sale goes forward, you’re likely to lose
any equity that you have in the property. See Chapter 12 to see why bank-
ruptcy must be filed before a foreclosure sale is conducted.
Mortgage workouts
If your only problem is that you temporarily fell behind on your mortgage
payments — perhaps because of a layoff, sickness, or family emergency —
your mortgage holder may allow you to catch up on back payments over an
extended period of time. The bank doesn’t want your house, but it definitely
wants the money you promised to pay for it (or at least as much as it can
get).
The sooner you contact the lender, the better. After a foreclosure begins, 
the amount that you eventually have to come up with increases by at least
$1,000, because you have to pay the lender’s attorney fees.
When you’ve built up significant equity in a property, selling it before a 
foreclosure is completed usually is better. Foreclosures rarely produce 
any money over and above the amount owed to the lender, but you may 
be able to sell the property for more than that amount. That way, you get 
to keep the extra.
The widespread use of mortgage insurance also offers a glimmer of hope.
With this type of insurance, a mortgage insurer agrees to pay the lender any
losses that it suffers if you don’t pay the mortgage, and after it pays off the
lender, it steps into the lender’s shoes and takes over the loan.
Government agencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), 
the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 
the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), and the Veteran’s Administration
(VA) insure many mortgages. These agencies have programs designed to help
folks avoid losing their homes. When you approach the lender about a work-
out agreement, ask whether the loan is insured by one of these agencies. If
so, call the agency to find out what programs are available.
123
Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

Refinancing
By refinancing your mortgage — in effect, trading an old mortgage in for a
new one with a more favorable interest rate — you can significantly cut your
monthly payment, perhaps by a couple hundred dollars a month or even
more. You can shop around for a better mortgage rate at www.interest.
com/mmis.html and www.bankrate.com.
Generally, refinancing makes economic sense only when rates have fallen a
full 2 percentage points. Otherwise, closing costs and fees eat up any poten-
tial savings. Likewise, be wary of variable-interest mortgages, which fluctu-
ate, usually with the prime interest rate. They have a nasty tendency to go 
up at the worst possible time.
Home-equity loans
A world of difference exists between refinancing to get a better rate and
taking a home-equity loan — which doesn’t reduce the amount of your 
mortgage debt. All you really do with a home-equity loan is, in essence,
unbuy your house and then buy it back again.
Many companies aggressively tout home-equity loans, urging you to use 
the value that you’ve built up in your home as collateral. They claim that 
borrowing against your home to pay off credit cards is the greatest thing
since canned beer because
 Interest on home mortgages is tax-deductible.
 Making a single monthly payment is more convenient than numerous
credit-card payments.
124
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 
An often-overlooked defense to foreclosures
The Federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA — U.S.
Code, vol. 15, secs 1601–1667) (volume 15, sec-
tions 1601 through 1667 of the official compilation
of federal statutes known as the United States
Code) can be a godsend in stopping foreclosure.
The TILA requires lenders to provide borrowers
with certain precise information about the loan,
at the time that it’s made. If the lenders screw
up — and they often do — you can rescind, or
cancel, a mortgage on your home, thus ending
the foreclosure. At some point, you’re supposed
to repay the money that you borrowed, but if you
don’t, they can’t take your home. The time for
rescinding expires three years after the loan is
made.
Truth-in-lending defenses frequently are over-
looked because most lawyers aren’t up to
speed on the Act. Public-interest law offices
and legal aide counselors tend to be the most
knowledgeable about this powerful weapon.
The greatest limitation to TILA defenses is that
the TILA doesn’t apply to mortgages taken to
buy the home — probably your first mortgage.

 The interest rate is lower.
 Your monthly payment will be lower than what you’re now paying on
credit cards.
Sometimes the slick ads also subtly suggest that you may even have enough
cash left over after paying off credit cards for you to take a much-deserved
vacation or buy an expensive toy.
All this may sound pretty good, but don’t forget that your home may be the
most valuable and important asset that you have, and you’re putting it at risk
when you play the home-equity credit game. If paying credit-card bills was a
struggle, making payments on a home-equity loan probably won’t be much
easier. To make matters worse, after your credit-card bills are paid off, your
credit-card accounts will be available for more borrowing — the very thing
that got you into trouble in the first place.
You also want to keep in mind that home-equity loans usually carry a steeper
interest rate than conventional mortgages, so you probably won’t save much
in interest. And if your plan is to take out a loan so that you can pay a
number of smaller bills, you’re actually just exchanging many smaller bills for
a large one, and probably paying some loan fees to boot.
Furthermore, remember that a home-equity loan creates a lien on your home
that survives bankruptcy. Say that after sucking all the equity out of your
home to pay your credit-card bills, you still end up in bankruptcy. What
you’ve done is needlessly put your house on the line. The credit-card debts
were unsecured and would’ve probably been eliminated in bankruptcy. But
the value of your house secures the home-equity loan. No wonder lenders
(and sometimes credit counselors who work openly — or not — for lenders)
push home-equity loans!
Whenever you do consider refinancing, be on the alert for hidden costs, such
as broker’s fees, points (additional interest), and penalties for prepaying your
present mortgage. These fees can negate the benefits of using home equity to
consolidate your debts.
And watch out for loans that require “balloon” payments. Sometimes, these
loans are structured in such a way that you fork over relatively small monthly
payments until the final installment is due — and then you get whacked.
Finally, if bankruptcy is even remotely visible on your horizon, consult with
an attorney before taking out a second mortgage. The sight of folks losing
bankruptcy as a viable solution by taking out one of these loans is all too
common, so you need to be quite clear about the ramifications of a second
mortgage before taking that step. No competent attorney will try to push you
125
Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

into bankruptcy if that isn’t your best choice, or if you’re just not ready. But a
good bankruptcy lawyer needs to be able to give you a clear picture of the
potential benefits and drawbacks of your unique situation. Expect to pay a
reasonable fee for the lawyer’s time (between $100 and $200) and consider it
a smart investment. See Chapter 3.
Reverse mortgages
So-called reverse mortgages usually target senior citizens (borrowers must be
at least 62 years old to qualify), enticing them to tap into their home equity
by borrowing money that doesn’t have to be repaid until they move or die.
For example, say you’re 65 years old, and you own your $100,000 home free
and clear. With a reverse mortgage, you’d borrow up to some specified per-
centage of the home’s value, say $80,000, and then receive portions of that
money in regular intervals without having to make any mortgage payments.
Sounds like a good deal, doesn’t it? Depending on your unique circumstances,
it may be. Just don’t lose sight of the fact that someday that loan will have to
be repaid; otherwise, your house will be turned over to the lender, and that
inevitability may come as quite a shock to your heirs.
Be very careful when considering a reverse mortgage and look out for outfits
that prey on older people with equity in their homes. Stick with a reputable
lender and be sure that you understand all the costs and fees that you’ll be
charged. Finding out whether and how a reverse mortgage in your particular
situation may affect your eligibility for government benefits, such as Social
Security or Medicaid, also is a good idea.
Reliable information is available by calling the American Association of
Retired People at 1-800-209-8085 or visiting its Web site at www.aarp.org.
Once again, we encourage you to talk to a bankruptcy lawyer before entering
into a reverse-mortgage arrangement. Depending on the available homestead
exemption, you may be much better off just filing bankruptcy.
Tapping your retirement plan
In most states, creditors can’t get at your pension unless you enable them to
do so by withdrawing the money or taking a loan against it. Taking either of
those routes seldom is a good move. You may face serious tax consequences
when you take an early pension distribution or fail to repay a pension loan.
126
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Borrowing against your retirement plan is usually a lousy idea because
 It gives the lender a claim against your pension. Ordinarily, creditors
can’t get their hands on your retirement account.
 Most debts that you’d pay with the proceeds of the pension loan, such
as credit-card accounts, can probably be wiped out in bankruptcy.
 If you don’t repay the pension loan, you suffer serious tax consequences.
 If you lose your job, you may have to repay the loan almost immediately.
In a few situations, tapping into your retirement fund may be a feasible way of
solving your problems. But you’d do well to find out your bankruptcy options
before risking your retirement nest egg.
Choosing Which Bills to 
Pay First (If at All)
Chances are you don’t have the money to pay all your bills, at least not right
away, so you’ll need to decide which ones to pay. You obviously need to con-
tinue paying current bills for living expenses like food and utilities.
Amid all your personal financial turmoil, debt collectors usually give you
crummy advice because all they care about is wringing as much as possible
out of you, as soon as possible, and with the least amount of effort on their
part. Your decisions must be based on reason and guided by what’s best for
you and your family, and not on what makes for a happy debt collector.
Keeping that perspective when a bill collector is bullying you isn’t always
easy. Remember, however, that the most obnoxious collectors act the way
they do because they really don’t have any other weapon to use against you.
We hope that you plan to talk to a bankruptcy lawyer before making these
decisions, but if you’re not quite ready to take that step, you may want to
start by asking yourself two questions:
 What can this creditor do if I don’t pay?
 Will I be able to escape this debt altogether if I eventually decide to file
bankruptcy?
127
Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

When you can’t pay everyone, you need to invest your money where it does
the most good or avoids the gravest of problems. Dribbling out money to the
most aggressive collectors without an overall plan is a mistake. The pay-
ments at the top of your priority list (in order) should be your
 Rent, or mortgage, if you intend to keep your house
 Utilities
 Essential vehicle
 Fines, if nonpayment would land you in jail
 Child support and alimony
 Income taxes
 Possibly student loans (but first see whether you’re eligible for one of
the repayment plans described in Chapter 18)
It’s no accident that credit cards, loans from finance companies, and medical
bills don’t make the cut in this list. That’s because these types of creditors
must sue you and obtain a judgment before they can take any of your prop-
erty. In other words, before they can ever cause you any real trouble, they
have some hurdles to jump over. Besides, these kinds of debts can be wiped
out if you end up in bankruptcy.
If bankruptcy is in your future, you should neither repay any loans to close
friends or family members nor loans that are cosigned by any such people. If
you file bankruptcy within one year of making these types of payments, the
trustee can get the money back. See Chapter 19.
As a general rule, you need to be wary of partially paying creditors just
because you think it will get them off your back. It won’t. Trust us on this
one. And it may cause you additional headaches in the future.
Credit counselors or consolidators backed by the lending industry may try
talking you into taking a home-equity loan to pay off your credit cards. If you
see any possibility at all that you’ll eventually go bankrupt (and it is probable
that you do), a home-equity loan is a terrible idea. The reason? You’d essen-
tially transform unsecured debts (your credit-card bills) into a debt secured
by your home. Then, if you don’t pay, they can take your home sweet home.
See why the creditors like it so much?
The National Consumer Law Center publishes a guide that helps you decide
which debts to pay and generally how to cope with debt outside of bank-
ruptcy. You can obtain this publication, Surviving Debt by Jonathan Sheldon
and Gary Klein, through many bookstores, or you can order it directly by

128
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Deciding whether to pay your mortgage
Although you’ll probably want to make your mortgage payments if you
decide to file bankruptcy, it isn’t necessarily a given.
Whenever your home is worth less than what you owe on it, you may just want
to save the money for a deposit on a new place to live, knowing that eventually
the mortgage holder will foreclose and kick you out anyway. However, if you
intend to keep your home, be sure to maintain insurance and, if possible, pay
real estate taxes. If you don’t, the lender may be able to foreclose even if you’re
making your payments.
Considering whether to 
make car payments
As is true with your house, the question to ask about your car is whether it is
worth less than you owe on it. You’ll have to make your car payments if you
want to keep it. And even if you decide to surrender the vehicle, your prob-
lem may not be cured. Most car dealers sell surrendered vehicles at whole-
sale prices, leaving you liable for any balance due on the loan. You may try
selling the vehicle yourself to raise enough to pay the loan in full and satisfy
the entire obligation.
Dealing with alimony and 
child support payments
If at all possible, you also need to get current with your alimony and child
support obligations. The consequences for neglecting those obligations are
serious, possibly even criminally serious if you’re jailed for contempt of
court. And many judges have adopted a zero-tolerance approach toward
deadbeat parents.
Deciding whether you should 
pay your taxes
You need to pay current income taxes, and probably those from the last three
years. Taxing authorities can make your life miserable if you don’t, and penal-
ties for not paying add up at an astonishing rate. (See Chapter 9 for more
information.)
129
Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

Negotiating with Your Creditors
If you can find someone who actually has the authority to negotiate, you 
may be able to cut a deal that works to everyone’s satisfaction. But if your
creditor is a large institution, you’ll have difficulty getting beyond the bean
counters and paper pushers — that is, if you even get past the answering
machines. You’re more likely to succeed if your creditor is a small organiza-
tion. Regardless, attempting a nonbankruptcy solution is worth the effort.
Workout agreements
Traditionally, a nonbankruptcy workout agreement — where a debtor reaches
a negotiated solution with creditors — falls into one of three categories:
 Composition arrangements, where all creditors agree to accept less than
full settlement of the debts
 Extension agreements, which merely extend the term for repayment in
full
 Combination agreements, where debts are reduced and paid over an
extended time period
The problem with these plans is that all your creditors must go along with it,
and so, the more creditors you have, the harder it is to get them to agree. In
addition, you’ll probably need a lawyer to negotiate settlement agreements,
and the legal fees may be exorbitant, if not prohibitive.
Strange as it may seem, whenever a creditor writes off a debt outside of 
the bankruptcy context, the amount of the write-off is taxable income to the
borrower unless he was insolvent (owed debts exceeding the value of your
assets) when the debt was kissed off. If you’re in this situation, consider 
filing Form 982 with your tax return. You can get it on the IRS Web site at
www.irs.ustreas.gov/formspubs/index.html (click forms and publi-
cations by number).
Workout agreements are more useful when you have valuable nonexempt
assets that are worth enough to pay your debts, but you need some time 
to sell without having to juggle creditors. In consumer cases, rarely does 
a debtor have enough assets to pay his debts.
Threatening bankruptcy
If you genuinely are considering bankruptcy, unsecured creditors may agree
to settle for a pittance simply because when you do actually file, they’d other-
wise receive nothing.
130
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Assume that you borrowed $50,000 to start a business, which never got off
the ground. There’s no way you can repay this debt, and all you own is a
modest home, mortgaged to the hilt, an old car, and a pension. If you file
bankruptcy, the lender won’t receive one red cent. If you offered the creditor
the money that you will otherwise spend on filing bankruptcy, about $1,000,
he should (if he’s thinking rationally) agree to taken the money and write off
the debt. A thousand dollars is still better than nothing. And you avoid
having to file bankruptcy.
The success of this kind of strategy depends on convincing your creditor that
you’re truly prepared to file bankruptcy. The best way to accomplish that is
to hire a well-known bankruptcy specialist to handle the negotiation. That
way, the creditor knows that you’re serious. But, don’t ever bluff or threaten
bankruptcy unless you’re truly prepared to turn in that direction.
Considering Credit Counseling Services
You can find a number of outfits that offer credit counseling. Consumer
Credit Counseling Services (CCCS) is the most common. CCCS offices are
local nonprofit debt-counseling outfits, numbering about 1,300 and joined
under the National Foundation for Consumer Credit.
CCCS acts as an intermediary between you and the creditors. It often gets
late fees dropped and wage garnishments revoked. Typically, you and the
CCCS counselor devise a repayment schedule, and then you make regular
payments to the CCCS, which forwards the money to the creditor.
Creditors pay CCCS a commission on the funds that it collects. Because of
this commission, some people claim that CCCS is nothing more than a glori-
fied bill collector. Nevertheless, fees charged to consumers are fairly nominal
and usually under $25 a month. Sometimes CCCS even renders its services
for free. To find a CCCS near you, call the main office at 800-388-2227, write 
to the headquarters at 8611 Second Ave., Suite 100, Silver Springs, MD 20910,
or check out the National Foundation for Consumer Credit Web page at www.
nfcc.org.
CCCS is more helpful to you in either of the following situations:
 When the total amount of your debts is small enough that you know you
can pay if just given enough time.
 When you intend eventually to file bankruptcy, but need to buy some
time. For example, you may be waiting until past-due income taxes
become dischargeable.

Chapter 7: Considering Alternatives to Bankruptcy

Although some organizations like CCCS offer valuable assistance, they’re also
allied with creditors and have an institutional bias against bankruptcy, even
when it’s in your best interest.
Some counselors are very good, and, if a person’s situation is truly hopeless,
they immediately refer that person to a competent bankruptcy attorney. On
the other hand, some counselors think that talking people out of filing bank-
ruptcy is their duty. They vigorously push repayment plans, which often are
doomed to fail. Additionally, they often fail to have the principal amount of
your debts reduced and don’t help much in extending payments on secured
debts.
Several other organizations offer online debt counseling. Many provide advice
about how to get out of debt. As with CCCS, however, you need to be skeptical.
Debt-counseling groups, even those with nonprofit status, don’t necessarily
have your best interests in mind, especially when filing bankruptcy is poten-
tially in your best interest. You may also want to think twice about submitting
personal financial information to a stranger.
In any case, here are some of the better known online services and their 
Web sites:

 American Consumer Credit Counseling: www.consumercredit.com

Terrible advice from a credit counselor
When Joe and Mary’s little boy, Ray, was diag-
nosed with leukemia, they spent all their sav-
ings, incurred $50,000 in medical bills, and
charged $20,000 on credit cards trying to do the
best for Ray. After Ray died, a credit-counseling
outfit convinced Joe and Mary to sell the family
home and cash in their pensions.
That was bad advice.
Even after surrendering all their assets, Joe and
Mary remained $23,000 in the red and still had
creditors on their tails. They ultimately ended up
in bankruptcy, but, by then, their home and pen-
sions, which would have been preserved had
they filed for protection earlier, were long gone.
The credit agency was looking out for creditors
and, from Joe and Mary’s standpoint, made a
rotten situation only that much worse.

You can also check your local phone book for debt counselors, but be very
careful. Many are nothing more than marketing fronts for companies trying 
to lend you more money. Some are downright crooks. Check out the joint
report by the National Consumer Law Center and the Consumer Federation of
America at www.nclc.org/initiatives/credit_counseling/content/
cc_enforcement.pdf.
Simply Ignoring Creditors
Sometimes doing absolutely nothing makes perfect legal and financial sense,
but using that tactic needs to be a conscious and intelligent decision that is
not a result of your refusal to face the music.
Whenever you live simply, have little income or property, plan to maintain
that lifestyle indefinitely, and don’t give a flip about your credit rating, doing
nothing may just be the wisest course. You can’t go to jail for failure to pay
debts (other than support obligations and criminal fines). Creditors can’t
strip you of basic necessities, such as clothes and food. A good part of your
income, as well as Social Security benefits, welfare, and unemployment are
inaccessible.
You can be sued, of course, but even bill collectors can’t extract blood from a
stone.
If you own virtually nothing and plan to own nothing in the foreseeable
future, you need to at least consider this option. Creditors recognize the futil-
ity of going after some people, don’t even bother to sue them, and eventually
just give up.
Although the do-nothing strategy may make sense at the moment, this strat-
egy has some limitations.
Your long-lost uncle may leave you a bundle, or maybe you’ll win the lottery.
If that happens, creditors may find out and try to get a piece of the action.
Even if your ship doesn’t come in, you’ll always have to be very careful with
bank accounts. When a judgment creditor finds out where you bank (and
some do periodically check), it can snatch your money. Depositing your
money in someone else’s account carries its own set of problems, not to men-
tion the danger that a creditor will seize all the money and force your friend
to prove just how much belongs to him. So, you may be forced to deal solely
in cash or money orders.
In short, before deciding to do nothing, you need to understand and be will-
ing to accept the possible consequences.

Handling Bill Collectors
In This Chapter
 Understanding that bill collectors are all bark and no bite
 Using federal law to fight back
 Looking to state law for help
 Keeping your guard up when dealing with bill collectors
I
t probably seems like yesterday — and it probably was — that credit-card
solicitors and hucksters of every stripe were just aching to be your best
pal. They just couldn’t wait to offer you more and more credit (at higher and
higher interest rates).
Well, now that you’ve missed a few payments, they’re singing a different tune.
They’ve turned on you like Brutus on Caesar and unleashed their debt collec-
tors, who play every game in the book to make you feel like a slimeball. They
call all the time, suggest that you’re going to get sued, and try to squeeze you
for whatever they can.
Although some debt collectors are reasonable people just trying to collect
what they sincerely believe is legally theirs, many debt collectors, especially
the ones working for professional debt collection agencies, are nothing but
bullies. They really can’t do much of anything, and if you stand up to them,
they’ll almost certainly back down.
Bill collectors have a grand total of one weapon in their arsenal — intimida-
tion — with all the firepower of a spitball. By comparison, you have an
armada in the form of federal and state debt collection laws.
The federal government has provided you with not only a shield but also a
sword in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and nearly every state aug-
ments that law with its own consumer protection laws.
In this chapter, we take an up close and personal look at bill collectors and
review your federal and state remedies for whenever they get nasty.

Taming the Toothless Tiger: 
The Bill Collector
Creditors with real leverage don’t waste time on endless phone calls threaten-
ing to sue you or repossess you car; they just do it. Landlords evict. Car
lenders repossess. Mortgage holders foreclose. Utility companies turn off the
power. Other creditors and their agents huff and puff and try to frighten you
with vague promises to take further action (whatever that means), report you
to credit bureaus, seize your wages, or turn the matter over to their attorneys.
The key to handling bill collectors is knowing how little power they actually
have.
Bill collectors essentially can
 Cancel your account (big deal)
 Report you to credit bureaus (they probably already have)
 Get a lawyer to sue you and get a judgment (easier said than done,
which is why some debt collectors put you on hold and pretend to con-
sult with the nonexistent on-site attorney)
But, bill collectors can’t
 Report you to your employer.
 Publish your name in the newspaper.
 Embarrass you to family and friends.
 Take any of your property, at least not until they obtain a judgment by
successfully suing you. Even then, most assets are off limits or exempt.
A creditor with a judgment may seize your bank account (if you’ve made
the mistake of leaving money in the bank) and roughly 25 percent of
your net wages. But the process is complicated, and many creditors
don’t bother.
When you don’t have enough money to go around, the bills to pay first are
the ones where creditors can do something (like take your car or foreclose
on your house) when you don’t pay. Bill collectors are more commonly used
to convince you to pay on unsecured debts. They know they’re at the bottom
of the food chain and are just hoping to get something, anything, out of you.
Giving aggressive bill collectors nothing at all usually is better than giving
them a small payment. Whenever they succeed in milking even a few dollars
out of you, they’re only inspired to keep begging. It’s kind of like feeding stray
mutts; keep it up, and you’ll never get rid of them.
136
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Don’t let bill collectors bully you into doing things like calling them at spe-
cific times or faxing something to them. These tactics are just an intimidation
game. They figure that if they can get you to obey just one command, they’ve
established some weird sort of dominance over you, and the next time, you
may come up with a few dollars. In short, you don’t have to play games with
debt collectors, and you don’t have to deal with them at all. So don’t.
Invoking Federal Law
Even though bill collectors have no real power, they surely can be a kick 
in the keister. Congress formally recognized this fact Sept. 20, 1977, when 
it passed the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The FDCPA protects con-
sumers from abusive collection techniques and harassment.
Understanding the FDCPA — and letting your creditors know you understand
it — is one of the most effective ways of abruptly putting an end to any overt
bullying.
Congress enacted the law after finding abundant evidence that many debt col-
lectors were using abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt-collection practices. It
concluded that those kinds of bill-collecting tactics actually increased the
number of personal bankruptcies, disrupted marriages, caused joblessness,
and invaded individual privacy.
The FDCPA specifies when, where, and how professional debt collectors can
contact you concerning a consumer (nonbusiness) debt. It outlaws certain
dirty tricks that bill collectors regularly used to employ, and it restricts com-
munications with third persons (such as your boss) concerning your debt.
Under the law, debt collectors can’t
 Call or contact you in any way before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., nor at any
other unreasonable time or place, without your permission
 Contact you by postcard
 Make you accept collect calls or telegrams
 Use a false name
 Publish your name and the nature of your debt
 Threaten to take any action, such as having your wages garnished or ini-
tiating a lawsuit, unless they have a legal basis for doing so and truly
intend to follow through
137
Chapter 8: Handling Bill Collectors

 Threaten to have you arrested
 Collect any amount greater than your debt, unless specifically autho-
rized to do so by other law
 Prematurely deposit postdated checks
The FDCPA applies only to those who regularly collect debts owed by others.
It doesn’t, however, apply to the original creditor.
In other words, if you owe money to the electric company, the collection
activities of the electric company aren’t restricted by the FDCPA (although
they may well be by state statute). And yet, if the electric company hires a
collection agency, the Act is triggered. Similarly, the Act doesn’t restrain IRS
or other governmental employees from acting in their official capacities, but
it does apply to private collection agencies hired to collect debts owed to the
government.
Additionally, although the original legislation specifically exempted attorneys
on the theory that they were only “incidentally involved in debt collection
activities,” Congress repealed that exemption in 1986. Since then, courts have
held lawyers to a pretty high standard. Simply put, attorneys (of all people)
must be pretty careful to cross all their T’s and dot all their I’s when it comes
to debt collection. If a collections attorney contacts you, advise him right
away that you know your way around the FDCPA. That way, you’ll be dealing
with a very careful, or a very dumb, lawyer. Either way, you come out on top.
If you believe a debt collector has violated the FDCPA, you can report her to
the Federal Trade Commission Correspondence Branch, 600 Pennsylvania
Northwest, Washington, DC 20580.
Depending on how badly the debt collector behaved, you may also have
grounds for a lawsuit. See the section “Your remedies under the FDCPA,” 
later in the chapter, for more details.
When debt collectors can contact you
Debt collectors can contact you only at reasonable times. They can’t contact
you any time that they have reason to believe is inconvenient and, in general,
may not contact you when they know an attorney represents you. Collectors
must tell you that they’re calling from a collection agency, and they must
identify the original creditor and the amount of the balance. They must tell
you that you have 30 days to dispute the debt.
138
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

If you tell a bill collector that you’re busy and she doesn’t terminate the call,
or if she calls back when she should realize that you’re still busy, she’s proba-
bly in violation of the law. Ditto if the person answering the phone tells her
that you’re sleeping. And for the most part, bill collectors can’t contact you
at all — and that means no calls, no visits, no letters, and no telegrams — if
you’ve notified them in writing to buzz off (see the sidebar, “Sending a ‘bug-
off’ letter” for more information).
Where debt collectors can’t contact you
Debt collectors may not contact you at any place that is inconvenient for you
or causes you unnecessary embarrassment. They may not contact you at
work, if they’ve been informed that your employer forbids such communica-
tion. Furthermore, a bill collector can’t contact you at work if she has reason
to know that a call would be inconvenient for you, regardless of whether your
employer allows such interruptions.
When debt collectors may contact 
others about your debt
Generally, the FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from contacting third persons,
or others, about your debt, thus outlawing the once common tactic of trying
139
Chapter 8: Handling Bill Collectors
Sending a “bug-off” letter
Under the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices
Act, you can send third-party debt collectors
(not the original creditor) what is known as a
cease-and-desist letter — which is legalese for,
“Yo! Take a hike, sucker!”
After receiving this notification, the debt collec-
tion agency can’t communicate with you further,
except to
 Advise you that the debt collection efforts
are being stopped
 Inform you that the collector or creditor
intends to do something specific, like sue you
A simple letter, such as this, should do the trick:
Pursuant to the Federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act, 15 USC§1692c(c), I ask that
you stop communicating with me about my
account with ______________, account
number ______________. I will take care
of this matter when I can.
Although not required, sending your notification
by certified mail, return receipt requested, is a
good idea, so you have proof that the bill col-
lector received it. Send one copy to the collec-
tion agency, one to the original creditor, and one
to the Federal Trade Commission.
Sending a cease-and-desist letter does not, of
course, eliminate your obligation to repay the debt.

to shame people into paying a debt. But spouses and guardians aren’t consid-
ered third persons. So, any time a bill collector contacts you, he can also con-
tact spouses or guardians.
Under the statute, your parents may be contacted only if you’re a minor; oth-
erwise, they’re considered third persons and are off limits. Others not specifi-
cally mentioned in the law — like siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents, or
living companions — always are considered to be third persons.
A debt collector can contact your attorney, a credit-reporting agency, and any
codebtors. She also can contact any person for the purpose of locating you
or obtaining your address, phone number, or place of employment, provided
that she doesn’t already have that information. But she should never reveal
that you owe a debt and generally may not contact the same person more
than once. When the collector knows that a lawyer represents you, she must
go through the attorney and can’t contact others unless the lawyer is unre-
sponsive.
If a creditor has a judgment against you, the collector can also contact others
to enforce that judgment.
Dirty tricks are outlawed
The FDCPA forbids debt collectors from engaging in any conduct that tends
to harass, oppress, or abuse you. They can’t unnecessarily leave messages
with a third person for you to return a call, contact you too frequently, imply
the use of force against you, use foul language, or threaten to embarrass you.
Additionally, the FDCPA prohibits false, misleading, or unfair practices by
debt collectors, including a number of specific practices that creditors have
traditionally used to collect debts.
These provisions are especially interesting because they highlight tactics
that creditors who aren’t subject to the act still may use against you, unless
your state has its own law outlawing such ploys.
Of course, the underlying threat of most bill collectors is that you’ll be sued if
you don’t pay up. But a debt collector’s threat to sue you can violate this law
if the collector doesn’t actually intend to do so. With varying success, collec-
tors have tried getting around this rule by saying they “can” sue, or the col-
lector is “authorized” to sue, or recommending that you settle the debt “out
of court.” One court said that threats to take “drastic action” and engage in
“vigorous prosecution,” were disguised threats to sue, and the collector vio-
lated the law because he never really planned to do so.
140
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Your remedies under the FDCPA
You can sue a debt collector for violating the FDCPA and recover actual dam-
ages, punitive damages up to $1,000, and attorney fees. Long shot? Maybe, or
maybe not.
Consider this: A Texas jury was so outraged by a credit company’s attempt to
collect on a $2,000 debt that it awarded the debtors $11 million in damages.
Who knows, maybe that pesky debt collector will make you a millionaire! But
don’t bet on it.
A debt collector still may prevail by proving that he didn’t intend to violate
the act, and just made an honest mistake.
You must file your suit within one year of the violation.
Tapping State Laws
Under our legal system, laws actually come from two places: legislative
bodies that enact statutes, and courts that issue decisions in particular cases
that apply to similar situations in the future. This body of court-made law has
evolved though the centuries and is known generally as the common law. So,
although the FDCPA usually doesn’t apply to creditors collecting their own
debts, state laws may.
State statutes
Almost every state has a statute dealing with abuses by creditors and/or debt
collectors.
141
Chapter 8: Handling Bill Collectors
Collector told to take a hike
Sandy was trying her best to pay her bills but
had fallen way behind. Bill collectors were
harassing her, calling at all hours, and threat-
ening to tell her employer. Finally, she discov-
ered the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act
(FDCPA) and kept a copy of it by the phone.
Whenever bill collectors called, she cited the
law verbatim, telling them to take a hike.
That got their attention.
Sandy turned the tables on the bill collectors
and sent them running for cover.

Although those laws differ greatly from state to state, most states outlaw
some or all the conduct that is forbidden under the FDCPA. State statutes,
unlike the federal law, generally apply to creditors collecting debts that
debtors owe them. You can call your state’s attorney general’s office or 
consumer protection agency for a review of local laws.
For a comprehensive analysis, look at Robert J. Hobbs’s book, Fair Debt
Collection (National Consumer Law Center, third edition, 1996). Hobbs’s book
is the bible for consumer rights lawyers. You can purchase a copy by contact-
ing the National Consumer Law Center, 77 Summer St., 10th Floor, Boston, MA
02110-1006; phone, 617-523-8089.
Common law remedies
Aside from statutory prohibitions, creditors who intentionally misbehave can
get into trouble by violating time-honored principles of common decency. In
extreme cases, you may be able to sue a creditor or debt collector for things
like abuse of process, malicious prosecution, defamation, intentional inflic-
tion of emotional distress, and other such wrongs. Talk to a lawyer to find out
whether any of these theories applies to your situation, but remember that a
creditor’s conduct must be pretty outrageous to give rise to a claim under
common law.
Keeping Your Dukes Up
Your government — and your society — have determined that overbearing
debt collection efforts won’t be tolerated. Many debt collectors skirt the law
by counting on your ignorance, but when you know your rights and you’re
ready to exercise them, chances are that overzealous bill collectors will back
off in search of easier prey.
If a debt collector can’t get any money out of you, she may eventually give up
and leave you alone. For that reason, making small payments sometimes is
worse than making no payments at all.
You need to be on guard for the following common collections ploys:
 Collectors typically use caller ID, so you need to be careful if you want to
keep your phone number secret when you call or return a call from a bill
collector. You can prevent identification by dialing *67 (1167 for rotary
phones) prior to dialing the number, but check with your local phone
company because procedures sometimes vary. The *67 remedy, how-
ever, won’t work when you’re calling an 800 or 888 (toll-free) numbers.
With toll-free numbers, the only way to evade detection is by using a
public phone.
142
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

 Any FDCPA claim must be listed as an asset in your bankruptcy. In a
Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy case, only the trustee can prosecute
the FDCPA, and any recovery, after paying you the amount of any exemp-
tion, would be distributed to your creditors. But when the Chapter 7
trustee doesn’t want to bother trying to collect on the claim, she aban-
dons it, and then you’re able to prosecute the claim by yourself and
keep all proceeds. In a Chapter 13 reorganization bankruptcy, instead of
prosecuting the claim herself, the trustee authorizes you to do so. But
any recovery you receive is paid into your Chapter 13 plan and distrib-
uted to creditors.
 Avoid giving a creditor or bill collector a postdated check even (perhaps
especially) when they ask you to. Sometimes intentionally writing a
check without sufficient funds is a crime and gives the creditor the
added leverage of threatening criminal charges or challenging discharge
of the debt in bankruptcy.
 Be careful not to agree to a payment plan when you’re disputing any part
of the debt. If a collection notice contains an error, write to the source
requesting that the mistake be corrected before formally agreeing to any-
thing. The FDCPA requires debt collection agencies and lawyers to stop
collection efforts until they obtain verification of the debt, provided that
the consumer’s written request is received within 30 days of the collec-
tor’s giving the consumer notice of the right to dispute the debt. If you
don’t raise a dispute within this period, you may confront an argument
that you’ve “agreed” that you owe the debt.
 If the dispute involves a revolving account, a credit-card account, or an
electronic transfer of money, federal regulations provide you 60 days
after receiving an erroneous bill within which to send a letter to the
creditor indicating a billing error. Even where these laws don’t apply,
most creditors take a second look at the account whenever the debt is
disputed.
 Taping a bill collector’s call without consent is a dicey proposition. It is,
after all, illegal in many states, and unethical for lawyers. But you can
refuse to talk to a bill collector unless he agrees to allow you to tape the
call. And if a bill collector is dumb enough to leave an abusive message
on your answering machine, by all means, save that tape.

Negotiating with the IRS
In This Chapter
 Understanding the tax-collection process
 Introducing the warm-and-fuzzy Internal Revenue Service
 Negotiating with the IRS
 Plotting bankruptcy while negotiating
 Using the taxpayer advocate
L
ike a lingering cold or an ex-boyfriend, sometimes it seems that you just
can’t get rid of an old tax bill.
In some situations, bankruptcy may just do the trick (see Chapter 15), but 
frequently your best shot at relief is negotiating with the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and hoping it’s in a conciliatory mood. You usually can’t force
Uncle Sam to negotiate, but if he comes to the table, his concessions are
legally binding. And, luckily for you, there’s never been a better time for deal-
ing with the taxman.
This chapter explains how the IRS goes about getting its (your?) money,
describes the logistics and implications of negotiations, discusses how you
can negotiate with the IRS while quietly preparing your bankruptcy, and tells
you how the government’s own taxpayer advocate actually can help you. Ah,
your tax dollars at work!
Looking at the Tax Collection Process
The IRS uses three different, and somewhat overlapping, offices to collect
taxes:
 Service Centers are where you file your tax returns. These centers are
located in Andover, MA.; Atlanta, GA; Austin, TX; Cincinnati, OH; Fresno,
CA; Holtsville, NY; Kansas City, MO; Memphis, TN; Ogden, UT; and
Philadelphia, PA.

 Automated Collection System (ACS), which is a closed-to-the-public
command center where scores of clerks sit in front of computer moni-
tors and deal with people only by phone or letter.
 Local offices, staffed by revenue officers. The people in these offices
have some clout, unlike those in the Automated Collection System.
Service centers
If you don’t pay the tax due with your return, you are first be sent a polite,
nonthreatening letter entitled “Request for Payment” or “Notice of Federal
Taxes Due.” It’s really just a friendly reminder.
When you don’t pay within about five weeks of receiving that letter, the
Service Center sends the first in a series of four increasingly nasty notices.
The first is identified with the number 501, and the last, 504, is a Notice of
Intent to Levy (levy means “seize your property”). Sending you this series of
letters takes about six months. Along the way, you receive Publication 594
(Understanding the Collection Process). If you’re heading in this direction,
you may want to download the document now from the IRS’s Web site at
www.irs.gov.
Despite the “Intent to Levy” title of the 504 notice, the IRS probably has no
real intention of imposing a levy right away. And although this notice says
that it’s “final,” that just means if you don’t pay, your file is transferred to
another office. In other words, when you receive a 504 notice, you need to
take it seriously without losing a whole lot of sleep.
Automated Collection System (ACS)
ACS has the power to mail further collection notices, negotiate payment
arrangements, grab your bank accounts, and intercept your wages. It is
essentially faceless. Collectors may not even use their real names, and 
you probably won’t deal with the same official twice.
The ACS is the IRS’s notion of efficiency, and its minions try to keep your file
within this monument to Murphy’s Law whenever possible. However, if you
tell them that you don’t understand the notices you’re receiving, and that
you can’t agree with what the IRS says you owe, your file should be trans-
ferred to a local office. Then, you can deal with a real, honest-to-goodness
bureaucrat.
146
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

Local revenue officers
If the ACS can’t collect the tax, or if you’ve so requested, you hear from a rev-
enue officer. Although looking at a tax collector face to face is a little scarier
than just talking with someone on the phone, it may well be preferable to
dealing with the ACS, especially when the officer can suspend collection
activities by concluding that there’s no way you can pay anything.
Making Nice with the Touchy-Feely IRS
Taxpayers and courts long have complained, and with good reason, about the
overbearing presence of the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS and its cadre
of bureaucrats from you-know-where seemed to relish its guilty-until-proven-
innocent-and-even-then-still-guilty attitude.
A few years ago, however, Congress conducted a bunch of hearings and got
an earful from constituents who felt like the IRS was treating them like axe
murderers. Those hearings resulted in legislation imposing a wide range 
of restrictions on the collection efforts of the IRS. So now, after years of 
nurturing its reputation as a bulldog, the Internal Revenue Service is trying 
to embrace something of a teddy-bear image. It really has become far more
accommodating, if not exactly cuddly.
147
Chapter 9: Negotiating with the IRS
Keeping your eye on the statute of limitations
The Internal Revenue Service essentially has
ten years to collect a tax. After that, the tax van-
ishes. The ten-year clock normally begins tick-
ing shortly after you filed your return when the
tax is assessed.
But there’s a glitch.
If you don’t file a return, the statute of limitations
never starts, and a dummy return, one that’s
filed in your name by the IRS, doesn’t count.
Figuring out when the statute of limitations
begins and expires can be pretty tricky because
the clock stops and starts like so many hiccups.
For example, a bankruptcy filing tolls, or sus-
pends, the statute during the period your case
is pending, plus an additional six months.
You also toll the statute of limitations when you
 Request a taxpayer assistance order
 Make an offer in compromise (see the
upcoming section “Submitting an Offer in
Compromise”)
 Sign a waiver of the statute
 Ask for a collection due process hearing
Although the IRS has the power to go to court
to extend the statute before it expires, it won’t;
unless you owe a king’s ransom or you’ve been
a pain-in-the-butt chronic tax protestor.

The kinder, gentler IRS is considerably less arrogant and appreciably more
humble than it once was. And with all the new procedures, IRS collection
efforts have become so burdensome that authorities are more willing to
settle than ever before.
As part of its new image, the IRS maintains a very useful Web site (www.irs.
gov), where you can find all the official IRS forms, instructions, and other
helpful information mentioned in this chapter.
Your due process
One of the reforms, known as collection due process, took effect in January
1999 and requires the IRS to give you at least 30 days warning before seizing
your property and to notify you of your right to appeal its determinations.
The appeal, which first is heard by the IRS Appeals Office, provides you with
an opportunity to claim that you’re an innocent spouse (where your wife or
husband fudged a joint tax return without telling you) or determine the
appropriateness of an asset seizure and the correctness of the amount the
IRS claims is due. More important, the taxpayer can also propose alternative
payment plans such as installment agreements or offers in compromise (see
the upcoming sections in this chapter). If the appeals office turns you down,
you can go to federal court and have a judge review the situation. All these
new procedural safeguards must take place before any of your property is
actually seized.
Negotiating an installment agreement
When you owe less than $25,000, getting the IRS to accept a payment pro-
posal is actually pretty easy. A government that can get what it wants (your
money) with a minimum of hassle makes for happy bean counters.
An installment agreement requires that you
 Make all payments on time
 File all future tax returns and pay the taxes due on those returns in full
 Furnish updated financial information whenever requested
 Agree that any state or federal refunds be applied to your unpaid taxes
If your file is still with the Service Center, you can use Form 9465 Installment
Agreement Request. This form doesn’t require any supporting information
about your ability to pay. All you do is plug in the amount you can afford to
pay each month and mail it. The IRS normally responds within about 30 days.
You may want to take a look at Taxes For Dummies, an annual by Eric Tyson
148
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

and David Silverman (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). It includes a section about filing
this form (among other tax pointers).
Your offer is likely to be accepted if the payment you propose takes care of
your total tax debt, including interest and penalties that continue to accrue,
within 36 months.
If, on the other hand, your file has been transferred to ACS or your local dis-
trict office, you need to tell the collector that you want to make an install-
ment agreement and indicate how much you can afford to pay. If your offer is
rejected, stop! Get professional help.
Knowing when to get professional help
If you owe $25,000 or more or your request for an installment agreement has
been denied, we suggest that you hire a lawyer or accountant who is experi-
enced in dealing with the IRS.
At this juncture, the IRS can and does insist on detailed information about all
your assets and your family’s income and living expenses.
The Service Center and ACS use Form 433-F. Other offices use Form 433-A 
for individuals and Form 433-B for businesses and self-employed individuals.
These forms generally are referred to as Collection Information Statements
(CIS).
From the IRS’s perspective, the CIS are good for
 Detailing total household income and expenses
 Measuring your expenses against IRS guidelines, which the collector
may fine-tune to fit your individual situation
 Telling the IRS where all your assets are located, which facilitates seizure
in the event negotiations fall through or you end up defaulting on your
agreement
The IRS normally requires payments equal to all your net income minus 
necessary living expenses. Some collection employees have pretty bizarre
notions of how much it costs to live and demand completely unrealistic 
payment plans. But your lawyer or accountant may be able to have such
functionaries overruled by the bosses. What’s the point in agreeing to 
a payment structure that you can’t meet, especially when you complete 
a CIS telling the IRS exactly where to get at each of your assets?
If the CIS show that you have any liquid assets — such as cash, stock, or
bonds — equal to the amount of tax you owe, the IRS demands immediate
payment and may insist that you take cash advances or use credit cards 
to pay taxes.
149
Chapter 9: Negotiating with the IRS

Although you can now pay taxes with major credit cards, that’s probably not
a good idea for anyone considering bankruptcy, because
 Loans to pay nondischargeable federal taxes also are nondischargeable.
 Credit-card issuers commonly assess special fees when the card is used
to pay taxes.
Gaining “uncollectible” status
If the IRS determines that collecting the tax creates an undue hardship, it may
suspend collection efforts indefinitely. (In IRS-speak, the account is “53’d,”
based on the number of the form the revenue officer must complete when
reporting that an account is uncollectible.)
Undue hardship means that you’re unable to meet necessary living expenses
if required to make installment payments or if the IRS seizes your assets. The
agency distinguishes between undue hardship and mere inconvenience —
usually finding in favor of the former when it thinks pursuing you isn’t worth-
while and finding the latter when going after your assets may be worthwhile.
However, even with an undue hardship, your tax isn’t abated. Taxes and
penalties continue to accrue, and tax liens aren’t released. And, of course, the
IRS continues to grab your refunds.
The ten-year statute of limitations on collection continues to run, however,
and the IRS typically reopens the account right before the statute is about to
expire, most likely in an attempt to intimidate you into signing a waiver of the
statute of limitations. Don’t do it! See a tax specialist!
Planning bankruptcy while pursuing 
an installment agreement
You and your lawyer need to be keenly aware of how an installment agree-
ment can affect a bankruptcy down the road. You must consider
 The statute of limitations on collection: If the term of an installment
agreement expires less than one year before the ten-year statute of limi-
tations, the IRS can insist that you agree to extend it for up to five more
years, and that’s something you need to consider with extreme care. You
may be better off putting up with the IRS for a little longer and letting the
statute of limitations expire. Then, you’re home free.
 The time restrictions for wiping out taxes through bankruptcy: An
installment agreement doesn’t extend the various time periods that
must pass before taxes are rendered dischargeable in bankruptcy.
150
Part II: Avoiding Bankruptcy 

 Tax liens: Taxes may be much more difficult to wipe out or manage in
bankruptcy when a tax lien has been filed. Under current policy, if the
amount due under an installment agreement is less than $25,000, the IRS
won’t file a lien (although it may already have done so under previous
procedures). In other cases, the IRS can postpone filing a lien as long as
you’re honoring your installment agreement.
 Allocating tax payments: When you make installment payments, you des-
ignate how your payments are applied. Requiring the IRS to apply pay-
ments to the most recent years usually is best. As time goes by, taxes for
the earlier years become dischargeable if you end up filing bankruptcy.
Submitting an Offer in Compromise
Unlike a payment agreement, an offer in compromise that the IRS accepts
actually results in a reduction in the amount you owe. After getting its wrists
slapped by Congress, the IRS is more willing to make a deal than ever before.
Checking out Forms 656 and 656-A (and their accompanying instructions),
which you can download from the IRS Web site, gives you a good idea of
what’s required. However, you need to seek out professional help when actu-
ally preparing and submitting an offer. Some accountants and attorneys now
specialize in helping folks submit offers in compromise.
The grounds (three exist) for an offer in compromise are
 Doubt about whether you actually owe the tax.
 Doubt about whether you have sufficient assets and income to pay the
tax in full.
 Exceptional hardship or unfair or inequitable circumstances caused by
payment in-full requirements. (This last one is brand new and its con-
tours will have to be developed.)
When determining how much it will accept in settlement, the IRS looks at
your present assets and future earning ability. It calculates how much it
would receive from a quick sale of all your assets and adds a lump-sum
amount based on what it figures you’d have been able to pay on taxes during
the next 48 months.
If you can pay this amount in a lump sum within 90 days, the IRS is likely to
accept your offer. If not, you can request up to two years to pay, but the
amount increases to whatever the IRS thinks you can pay over 60 months
rather than 48 months. However, taxpayers who have less than four years left
on the ten-year statute of limitations need offer only the amount they can pay
for the period remaining under the statute. Even if you can’t pay that amount,
don’t give up. Given its new attitude and growing backlog, the IRS may accept
substantially less, so making such an offer definitely is worth a try.
151
Chapter 9: Negotiating with the IRS

The disadvantages of making an offer in compromise are
 It doesn’t resolve state tax debts.
 It may delay the time for filing bankruptcy. One condition for discharging
a tax in either a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy is that it had to be
assessed more than 240 days before the bankruptcy is filed. If you file
bankruptcy within 240 days of submitting an offer in compromise, the
clock stops. In other words, you must wait for a period of time equal to
the sum of 240 days, plus the time your offer was pending, plus 30 days
before your taxes can be discharged in bankruptcy.
 If you later default on future tax liabilities, the tax liabilities that were for-
given are revived. The IRS keeps the offered sum, and you have to pay that
remaining balance on the original tax along with interest and penalties.
 Making an offer extends the ten-year statute of limitations by the period
that your offer is under consideration plus an additional year.
Getting Help from a Taxpayer Advocate
A taxpayer advocate operates under the IRS Problem Resolution Program.
Such an advocate is supposed to act on your behalf whenever you’re suffer-
ing a significant hardship (being treated harshly or unfairly) because of the
way the IRS is administering the tax laws. An advocate has authority to issue
taxpayer assistance orders, which can, at least temporarily, stop collection
activities.
A taxpayer advocate is at your disposal and can be reached by
 Contacting your local taxpayer advocate office
 Calling toll free 877-777-4778
 Sending Form 911 to the local taxpayer advocate office
You can find out the address and phone number of the local taxpayer advo-
cate office and obtain copies of Form 911 by contacting your local IRS District
Office.
Disadvantages of a taxpayer assistance order are that
 It suspends the statute of limitations for whatever amount of time the
matter is under consideration.
 Any time during which a taxpayer assistance order is in effect doesn’t
count toward tax periods that normally would apply toward discharging
taxes.

Keeping Your Stuff

In this part . . .
I
n the not-so-good old days, creditors could literally
take the shirt off your back when you couldn’t pay
your bills. Those days are gone — despite the best efforts
of some mean-spirited folks who drafted the Bankruptcy
Abuse Reform Fiasco (BARF) of 2005. Yeah, you may lose
some of your property if you go bankrupt and the new law
will make it all more of a hassle, but when all is said and
done, much of your stuff is strictly off-limits to creditors.
This part explains what’s yours, what may go to the credi-
tors, and what you can do to keep your most important
possessions out of the paws and claws of your creditors.

Off Limits to Creditors

 Figuring out the value of your assets
 Seeing how certain assets are treated in bankruptcy
 Making the most of your exemptions
A
lthough you may lose some of your property by filing bankruptcy, the
days when creditors could quite literally take the shirt off your back are
long gone. Much of what you need and treasure most is exempt, which means
creditors can’t touch it. So, knowing what’s all yours, what isn’t, and what is
of equal interest to your creditors — who obviously are eager to grab any-
thing they can get their paws on — is really important.
In this chapter, you get the scoop on which assets you can keep, which ones
you may have to surrender, and how to make the most of it.
Grasping the Legal Concepts
Gaining an understanding of how bankruptcy affects your possessions means
that you need to understand two legal concepts:
 Property of the estate, which includes everything you own on the peti-
tion date (when you file bankruptcy), some things you acquire later, and
other assets that a trustee (the guy who represents the interests of cred-
itors; see Chapter 3) can recover under some circumstances
 Exemptions, which enable you to remove certain assets from the bank-
ruptcy process and take them out of the reach of creditors

The principles behind property of the estate and exemptions are important
in Chapter 7 liquidations and Chapter 13 reorganizations.
Even when an asset isn’t subject to the bankruptcy process, a creditor with a
security interest may cause you grief. (We take a closer look at this problem
in Chapters 11 and 12.)
Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy laws, you may lose any asset that is property of
the estate unless it is exempt.
In a Chapter 13 reorganization, your minimum payments are determined by
the value of your nonexempt property. For example, if the value of your
nonexempt property were $7,500, you’d have to pay at least that much during
the life of your Chapter 13 plan or sell an individual item and pay the pro-
ceeds to the trustee.
If one of your prized possessions is property of the estate and not covered by
an exemption, you can be required to give it up or pay its value to the trustee
regardless of which way you file — Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. The difference is
that in Chapter 7 you must pay for it in a couple of months, but in Chapter 13,
you can stretch out payments for up to five years.
By answering the following three general questions about an asset, you can
figure out whether a bankruptcy trustee has dibs on it or can make you pay
its value:
 Is it property of the estate? In other words, do you own it?
 What is the value of your interest in the asset? The trustee doesn’t care
about things worth only a few dollars.
 Does an exemption protect the asset? If so, neither trustees nor credi-
tors (unless a particular creditor has a lien; see Chapter 11) can get their
mitts on it.
Digging through the property of the estate
The first thing you need to know about an asset is whether it’s considered
property of the estate. That category includes
 Just about every asset you own when you file bankruptcy.
 Proceeds from property of the estate. For example, if your rental unit is
property of the estate, any rents that you receive, even after you file, are
also property of the estate.
 Inheritances and life insurance proceeds, if your benefactor dies before
bankruptcy or within 180 days after your filing.
156
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

 Marital property divisions that you become entitled to receive within
180 days after the petition date.
 Property you transferred prior to bankruptcy that was recovered when
the trustee flexed his strong-arm powers to undo the transfer. See
Chapter 19 for more on how trustees have the power to nullify certain
transfers of property.
Figuring out your interest in the property
If you own an asset jointly with someone else, ordinarily the trustee can deal
only with your chunk — not the half owned by your brother-in-law. But your
piece of the pie may well be on the line.
When an asset at issue serves as collateral for a debt, the creditor has owner-
ship rights in the item that are superior to yours or the trustee’s. If, for exam-
ple, your car is worth $10,000 and is subject to an $8,000 secured loan, your
interest in the car is only $2,000 ($10,000 – $8,000).
Spouses frequently own their homes jointly, which means each has an undi-
vided one-half interest.
In most states, each spouse’s property interests are separate, even though an
asset may be jointly owned. If you and your spouse own your home jointly,
each of you has a one-half interest. So, if you file bankruptcy, your wife’s
share of the house won’t become property of the estate, unless, of course,
she also files for bankruptcy (keeping in mind that you can, but don’t have to,
file a joint bankruptcy petition).
157
Chapter 10: Understanding Which Assets Are Off Limits to Creditors
Do you really own it?
An asset owned by someone else doesn’t
become part of your bankruptcy just because
you have it in your possession, and even an
asset titled to you isn’t necessarily your prop-
erty. The pretzel-logic of that concept is easier
understood with a few examples:
 The chain saw that you borrowed from your
neighbor isn’t included in your bankruptcy
just because it’s stored in your shed.
 If you’re an authorized signer on your elderly
uncle’s bank account, the account doesn’t
become part of your bankruptcy when all the
money really belongs to him.
 Property belonging to your children isn’t
included in your bankruptcy, but you may be
considered to be the real owner of expensive
items like a go-kart or motorized toy Jeep that
aren’t usually owned by minor children.
 When your name is on the title to your
teenager’s car, you can probably convince
the trustee that the vehicle doesn’t actually
belong to you — provided, that is, your kid
used his own money to buy it. If you bought
it for him, the trustee will insist that you
really do own it or, even if you don’t own it,
that he can go after it.

However, the score’s a little different when you happen to live in one of the
nine community property states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, or Wisconsin. In those states, all
property acquired by either spouse during the marriage is considered com-
munity property. Common exceptions are gifts and inheritances received by
one spouse during the marriage. Property acquired prior to marriage typi-
cally doesn’t become community property.
In the community property states, all community property (as well as the
individual property of the filing spouse) becomes property of the estate even
when only one spouse files bankruptcy. Individual property of the nonfiling
spouse doesn’t, however, become property of the estate.
Knowing what happens when someone owes you money
If someone owes you money on the date that you file bankruptcy, that debt is
considered an asset that is property of the estate, even when it isn’t paid
until later. So, for example, the income tax refund you’re expecting in the cur-
rent year is considered property of the estate, even if you don’t receive it
until after the petition date.
Accrued wages likewise are included in the estate, even though you won’t
receive them until after the petition date. Why? They actually were earned
before you filed. It sounds confusing, but thinking it through really isn’t that
difficult.
Say that you have a job where you’re paid weekly. Your paycheck usually
covers the previous week’s work, not the current one, so the employer is
always a week behind. That means that if you file bankruptcy on the day after
payday, your employer owes you one week’s pay as of that date. For bank-
ruptcy purposes, the wages you have earned before the petition date become
property of the estate, even though you haven’t yet received them.
Don’t sweat it too much. As we point out in the next section, most, if not all,
of that money ultimately will be covered by an exemption for wages anyhow.
Understanding how exemptions work
Determining which assets are up for grabs in bankruptcy is pretty tricky —
especially under BARF. The Bankruptcy Code contains a list of exemptions,
and each state has its own as well. Thirty-four states have opted out of the
Bankruptcy Code exemption, so theoretically residents of those states must
stick with state exemptions. If you live in one of the 16 states that recognize
both state and federal exemptions, you can choose whichever set works best
for you.
158
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Applying the rules, however, is an easier-said-than-done proposition. Here’s
why:
 You generally apply the law of the state of your permanent home for the
two years (actually 730 days) before bankruptcy. If, for example, you
lived in the same state two years ago as you do now, the laws of your
present state apply.
 If you haven’t lived in your present home state for two years, the applic-
able exemptions are those available in the state where you lived for 180
days immediately prior to that two-year period, or for the longer portion
of this 180-day period than any other state — at least theoretically. Some
state exemption laws say that they’re only for residents of that state. Say
that Sam moved from Oregon (which limits exemptions to Oregon resi-
dents) to Washington and filed bankruptcy in Washington within two
years. Under BARF, the Oregon exemptions apply. But Oregon law offers
its exemptions only to current residents of Oregon — and Sam the
Travelin’ Man now lives in Washington. So poor Sammy doesn’t get the
benefit of either Oregon or Washington exemptions, right? Even the pur-
veyors of BARF didn’t think that was fair, so they cobbled together a pro-
vision so that people like Sam can use the Bankruptcy Code exemptions
even in states that have theoretically opted out of the Bankruptcy Code
list. In other words, Sam gets to use the Bankruptcy Code exemptions
even though his home state of Oregon says that he doesn’t.
You’re not legally domiciled in a state just because you live there. Domicile
is your permanent home, the place you intend to return to after you finish
school, your tour of military duty, or your business assignment. Say that you
grew up in New York and went off to school in Tennessee, intending to return
when your studies were complete. For legal purposes, you were always domi-
ciled in New York, even when you were living in Memphis.

Lottery winner ends up in bankruptcy
Bennie won $3 million in the state lottery, which
was payable in annual installments of $128,000.
During the next six years, he spent so much
money that he had to file bankruptcy. The court
declared the balance of Bennie’s winnings
property of the estate, including the installment
payments that he expected to come due after
bankruptcy.

In addition, even if you’ve lived in a state more than two years, the maximum
homestead exemption you could claim (even if the laws of that state allowed
more) would be $125,000 if you acquired your homestead within 1,215 days 
of bankruptcy — unless you bought the home with money from the sale of 
a home you owned prior to that 1,215 day period. Example: Say that within
1,215 days of bankruptcy, you sold your first home, which you’d owned for
more than 1,215 days, and put $30,000 toward the purchase of your present
home. The homestead limit of $125,000 would be increased by $30,000 to
$155,000 — provided that your state had a homestead exemption that high —
unless the creditor could prove that during the ten-year period preceding
bankruptcy, you acquired a homestead for the purpose of stiffing creditors.
Honestly, armies of little trolls in Washington lie awake dreaming up this stuff!
Determining the Value of Your Stuff
After figuring out which set of exemption laws apply, you need to calculate
how much your property is worth. This calculation must be based not on the
cost of replacing your stuff with new items but rather on what it would cost
to obtain similar things in used condition. Some things such as an ongoing
business or a lawsuit from which you can recover money are extremely diffi-
cult to value. Your lawyer should be able to help you in those cases. For the
simpler stuff, the following list gives you a basic idea of what your stuff is
worth:

Buying Florida mansion nearly 
backfires on Buffalo boy
The kids were gone and the mortgage was paid
off, so Bart decided to leave the ad agency
where he’d toiled for 30 years and retire to
Florida. He sold the house in Western New York
for $315,000 and put the money toward a new
home in Daytona Beach. But after four years in
Florida, Bart was broke. His lawyer told him that
because he had lived in Florida more than two
years and acquired his home more than 1,215
days before bankruptcy, the unlimited Florida
homestead exemption would protect his home
in bankruptcy. But when Bart filed, creditors still
tried to have his home liquidated.
It was a close call, but the bankruptcy court
sided with Bart. The judge was convinced that
Bart planned to retire to Florida before he ran
into financial trouble. Otherwise, the court may
well have allowed the trustee to sell Bart’s new
home to pay off creditors. Bart escaped finan-
cial ruin by the skin of his teeth.

 Household goods: The value of household goods is what a secondhand
store would charge or the asking price for similar goods offered for sale
in newspaper classified ads. You might also check on www.ebay.com to
see whether you can find similar items for sale.
 Automobiles: You can check all three auto price guides — the Black Book,
Kelley Blue Book, and NADA Guide — by logging on www.cudirect.com.
The NADA Guide usually yields the highest price because it assumes that
all vehicles are in good condition. Another way to assess the value of your
car is to check classified ads in your local newspaper for similar models
for sale. Go by the retail rather than wholesale or trade-in value.
 Real property: Valuing real property depends on where you live. But a
good starting point may be finding out the figure used by your local tax
assessor — commonly known as the assessed value. But in some venues,
assessed values are ridiculously inaccurate. If you only recently pur-
chased the property, a better indication is the price that you paid.
Appraisals are great for determining value, but watch out: Appraisals
that are completed for loan purposes frequently tend to be high because
many lenders encourage appraisers to inflate values to justify making a
loan. The same is true of listing prices. Some real estate agents overstate
the value of your property to attract your business. We take a closer
look at valuing your home in Chapter 11.
 Pensions and life insurance: You usually can place a dollar amount on
your pensions and life insurance policies by calling the company.
Understanding How the Courts 
View Certain Assets
Special rules govern the way certain property — such as homes, cars, house-
hold items, and so on — is treated in bankruptcy. We discuss the most
common in this section.
Homesteads
Almost all states have some type of homestead exemption that protects some
or all the equity in a debtor’s home. Additionally, the Bankruptcy Code pro-
vides each debtor with a homestead exemption of $18,450. The exemption is
doubled ($36,900) for joint owners. This amount (as well as the amount for all
the other exemptions specified in the Bankruptcy Code) is adjusted every
161
Chapter 10: Understanding Which Assets Are Off Limits to Creditors

three years by the government to reflect changes in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI). The next change takes effect April 1, 2007. (We discuss home-
stead exemptions in much more detail in Chapter 12. Chapter 12 can help you
figure out the extent to which your home is protected by a homestead
exemption.)
Automobiles
Most states allow debtors to exempt at least one motor vehicle, but the
amount of the exemption is limited. The federal exemption scheme allows
each debtor to claim $2,950 in a motor vehicle.
Whenever the equity in your car exceeds your total exemption, a Chapter 7
trustee can sell the car and pay you the value of your exemption.
For example, when your motor vehicle exemption is $1,500, and your car is
worth $2,500, the trustee can sell your car but has to pay you $1,500. You’re
usually given the opportunity to keep your car by paying the net amount that
the trustee would receive from selling the vehicle.
In a Chapter 13, the trustee can’t sell the car, but you’d have to pay the
amount of nonexempt equity ($1,000 in the previous Chapter 7 example) over
the life of the bankruptcy plan.
You also may be able to claim an exemption for your motor vehicle as a tool
of the trade — if that’s what it is. For example, a professional driver’s semi rig
is likely to qualify, and a specially modified pickup truck used by a carpenter
probably fits the bill. But you’re really pushing your luck if you try for an
exemption on the Mercedes sports car that you use to impress your sales
clients.
See Chapter 10 for more on what happens to your car if you file bankruptcy.
Household goods
Most states exempt household goods up to a specified dollar amount. The
federal Bankruptcy Code exemption for household goods exempts single
items up to a value of $475 and all items up to a total of $9,850.
Occasionally, a question is raised about whether a particular item qualifies as
a household good — for example, a firearm. Several courts have said they
guns don’t qualify; however, another ruling indicates that a pistol used for
defense of the family was a household good, but that a shotgun and rifle used
for sporting purposes were not.
162
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Courts also seem to be having trouble deciding whether a computer is a
household good. Some courts say that a computer qualifies, and others 
say the exact opposite. A local lawyer familiar with the courts in your area
can be a big help in figuring out what may or may not be exempt.
Inheritances and life insurance benefits
Any inheritance or life insurance benefits left to you by someone who dies
before or within 180 days after you file for bankruptcy become property of
the estate.
However, if the benefactor passes away before you file bankruptcy, you may
be able to find a way of preventing your inheritance from going to the trustee.
In some states, you can renounce an inheritance before you actually receive
it so that it goes to other heirs. This strategy, however, is very tricky and fea-
tures many pitfalls. It’s definitely something to bring up with your lawyer.
Divorce settlements
Many times, divorce and bankruptcy go hand in hand.
If you become entitled to a divorce property settlement within 180 days after
your petition date, the property can be used to pay creditors. These rules
apply to property divisions (where a divorce court splits assets and allocates
debts) but not to alimony or support, which usually are exempt.
163
Chapter 10: Understanding Which Assets Are Off Limits to Creditors
Tenancy by the entirety
Some jurisdictions recognize an ancient form of
husband-and-wife property ownership known as
tenancy by the entirety, which protects joint prop-
erty from creditors of only one spouse. The effect
of such a rule is that under some circumstances,
jointly owned property may be fully exempt when
only one spouse files bankruptcy (if no joint cred-
itors are involved) or partially exempt after claims
of joint creditors are satisfied.
Jurisdictions recognizing tenancy by the entirety
are Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida,
Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mass-
achusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Vermont, Virginia, and Wyoming.

Sometimes filing bankruptcy and then waiting 180 days before filing for
divorce is a better strategy. This way, any property you are awarded in 
the divorce won’t be swept into your bankruptcy and liquidated to pay 
creditors. And, of course, make sure that your divorce lawyer knows about
your bankruptcy plans, and your bankruptcy lawyer knows about your
divorce. See Chapter 17 for more about divorce settlements.
Spendthrift trusts
A trust is a time-honored way for a wise benefactor to make a generous gift to
a young or reckless beneficiary without throwing caution to the wind. Legal
title to the property is transferred to a trustee (not to be confused with a
bankruptcy trustee) with specific instructions so that the beneficiary doesn’t
blow the entire inheritance.
Typically, the document establishing the trust includes a spendthrift provision,
which says the beneficiary’s creditors can’t touch the assets of the trust.
A beneficiary’s interest in a valid spendthrift trust doesn’t become property
of his bankruptcy estate because
 Creditors of the beneficiary never had any claim against the benefactor.
 The beneficiary can’t force the trust’s trustee to distribute trust prop-
erty to him, and neither can creditors or a bankruptcy trustee.
There are two kinds of trusts:
 Intervivos trusts: Trusts that are effective while a benefactor is still alive
 Testamentary trusts: Trusts that don’t go into effect until after the bene-
factor dies
If you’re the beneficiary of a testamentary trust, any distributions you actu-
ally receive from the trust within 180 days after filing bankruptcy become
property of the estate.
In addition, any distributions you receive from either type of trust are consid-
ered disposable income in a Chapter 13 case.
Although courts show considerable deference for legitimate trusts, they’re
not at all fond of scams or shams. Courts won’t honor spendthrift restrictions
in trusts that actually are manipulations designed to protect the donor’s
property from his own creditors. You can’t place your own property in a trust
for yourself just to keep it away from your creditors. Some self-anointed
164
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

“experts” touting “living trusts” may tell you differently. Don’t believe them.
Too often, debtors end up losing property they’d normally keep, except they
tried to con their creditors. Don’t get cute.
Furthermore, you can’t serve as sole trustee and sole beneficiary of the trust
at the same time, even when someone else sets it up. The courts aren’t going
to enable you to shield money when you have sole discretion over how and
when it’s distributed.
The most important point about trusts is that the rules are technical and
extremely tricky. Your lawyer needs to review all trust documents to deter-
mine whether you’re risking your interest in the trust by filing bankruptcy.
Rent receipts
Any income earned by property of the estate is itself property of the estate.
So, be careful if you’re a landlord — the trustee may have a claim to any rents
received from your property after the petition date.
If you rent out a part of your home, rents coming in after the petition date
may be covered by your homestead exemption, but check this situation out
with your attorney before spending the money.
When rent comes in from property that is not part of your home, it won’t be
covered by a homestead exemption. You may, however, be allowed to use
rent receipts to make postpetition mortgage payments on the rental property.
You need to receive the trustee’s consent or your attorney’s approval before
using rent receipts to pay the mortgage; otherwise, you may have to reim-
burse the estate for any rents that you paid out after the petition date. Just
imagine the predicament you’d be in if you had already spent the money for
something else!
Security deposits
Occasionally, a trustee tries to claim a debtor’s rent deposit, contending 
that the debtor must pay the amount of the deposit into the estate. Doing 
so, in our opinion, is tantamount to extortion, and courts tend to shoot down
the trustee’s claim for one of two reasons: Your landlord is entitled to contin-
ued possession of the deposit; or, it was protected under the homestead 
exemption.
However, before taking any action or making any assumptions, talk it over
with your attorney.
165
Chapter 10: Understanding Which Assets Are Off Limits to Creditors

Wages
As we mention in the “Knowing what happens when someone owes you
money” section earlier in this chapter, wages that you have earned, but not
yet received, as of the petition date are property of the estate, even when
they aren’t paid until afterward. Nevertheless, a large portion of your wages
is exempt. Under federal law, the estate can’t claim any more than 25 percent
of the net wages that are due to you on the petition date. In some states, you
get to keep even more money.
Sometimes a question arises about whether money that is due to a debtor
qualifies as wages. Courts disagree on whether accounts receivable can be
considered exemptible wages, even when the debtor is sole owner of the
business.
You can minimize the amount of wages that are at risk by filing your petition
soon after your payday. Of course, you want to spend this money (your pay)
before filing because the funds on hand as of the petition date would also be
property of the estate.
Bank accounts
Money in your checking and savings accounts typically is property of the
estate, unless you can demonstrate that all or part of the account balance
belongs to someone else.
Be careful when dealing with checks that haven’t yet cleared when you file
bankruptcy. That money technically is still in the bank, and the trustee can
make you pay the estate the amounts of any checks that clear after you’ve
filed. For that reason, using cashier’s checks or money orders to make pay-
ments (like your house payment) right before you file bankruptcy is a good
idea.
You may be able to exempt all or part of a bank account, however, when the
money in the account is traceable to some exempt source such as Social
Security benefits. Most states also allow modest exemptions for cash and
bank accounts.
Severance and vacation pay
Other factors to watch out for include whether your job entitles you to sever-
ance pay or whether you’re entitled to cash in on accumulated vacation time.
166
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

The trustee can’t, of course, force you to quit your job. However, if you
decide to terminate your employment while your bankruptcy case still is
open, the trustee may claim these kinds of benefits by arguing that they 
actually are compensation for services rendered prior to bankruptcy.
Nevertheless, a portion of your severance pay may be covered by your
exemption for wages.
However, be forewarned that a trustee may be able to cash in your vacation.
Courts differ about whether a portion of vacation pay is exempt. In one case,
on the petition date, the debtor was entitled to severance pay consisting of
accrued wages and vacation pay. The court ruled that the portion of sever-
ance pay attributable to accrued wages qualified for the 75 percent wages
exemption, but the vacation pay did not.
Sales commissions
A couple of thorny issues arise when the debtor is a commission salesperson.
The first is finding out whether an unpaid commission actually was earned
prior to bankruptcy. If so, it’s property of the estate even though the debtor
doesn’t receive it until after the petition date. After the issue is decided, the
question turns to whether a portion of the unpaid commission qualifies for
exemption as wages. If the court concludes that the commission wasn’t
earned until after bankruptcy, it’s yours and not property of the estate. In this
situation, it doesn’t matter whether it would be considered as exempt wages.
Real estate commissions
Real estate sales commissions are especially tricky because agents put a
great deal of work into their deals, but don’t actually receive a commission
until the sale goes through. What if a real estate agent files bankruptcy before
a deal actually closes?
Some courts say that a commission paid from a sale that closes after the peti-
tion date is not property of the estate because the commission wasn’t actu-
ally earned until after bankruptcy. Other courts would determine whether a
commission was earned before bankruptcy by figuring out how much work
the real estate agent performed prior to filing the bankruptcy petition. For
example, say a real estate salesperson, in putting together a sale, performed
90 percent of the work before bankruptcy. Some courts would say that 90 per-
cent of the commission is property of the estate.
167
Chapter 10: Understanding Which Assets Are Off Limits to Creditors

Insurance commissions
Issues similar to those that come up with real estate agents also occur when
an insurance agent files bankruptcy. Typically, insurance agents automati-
cally receive a commission every time one of their policyholders renews.
Trustees frequently try to latch on to commissions received by insurance
agents that are the result of postpetition renewals of policies they sold before
filing bankruptcy. The trustees’ argument is based on the premise that all the
work was done when the original policy was sold, so they want renewal com-
missions treated like accounts receivable owed on the petition date.
Insurance agents counter that policyholders won’t renew unless the agent
continues to service the account. Therefore, renewal commissions, in the
view of insurance agents, result from work they perform after the petition
date and thus aren’t property of the estate.
Some courts accept the trustee’s argument, some lean toward the agent’s,
and others try to strike a Solomonic balance by attempting to figure out how
much of a commission is attributable to prepetition work and how much to
postpetition efforts.
Under this approach, only that portion of the commissions resulting from
prepetition efforts is property of the estate. The rest goes to the debtor.
Similar to real estate commissions, the next question becomes whether
renewal commissions are exempt as wages. Again, courts disagree. Some say
that the exemption for wages is limited to the classic employer/employee
relationship and that commissions are more like business profits. Other
courts aren’t as strict and say that commissions qualify as wages for exemp-
tion purposes.
Suits to recover money
If you had the right to sue someone when you filed bankruptcy, any recovery
you receive from that suit is considered property of the estate, even if you
didn’t receive the money until after bankruptcy.
However, determining whether part or all personal-injury awards qualify for
an exemption depends on whether the award is for past earnings, medical
bills, pain and suffering, or future earnings. If at all possible, you need to settle
the claim before filing bankruptcy. Doing so enables your attorney to structure
a settlement that maximizes the amount that you can claim as exempt.
168
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Many exemption statutes say that personal-injury awards for loss of future
earnings are exempt but yet those for pain and suffering are not. Your lawyer
can devise a settlement agreement in which most of the award is allocated to
items that normally are exempt. Be sure to tell your personal-injury lawyer
that you’re thinking about bankruptcy and insist that he have a bankruptcy
specialist review any settlement documents before you sign them.
Depending on local law, your lawyer may advise you to file bankruptcy after
reaching a settlement but before you receive the money. In any event, funds
received from the settlement need to be placed in a separate bank account so
that they can be identified as the proceeds from your personal-injury claim.
If the claim can’t be settled before bankruptcy, a Chapter 7 trustee can con-
versely take over the prosecution of the suit and thereby control the struc-
ture of the settlement so that it maximizes the part that is not exempt.
So, one strategy is to file Chapter 13 to control prosecution and settlement
and then dismiss and file under Chapter 7. However, this strategy is pretty
tricky and needs to be thoroughly reviewed by your lawyer.
Income tax refunds
An income tax refund attributable to the year in which bankruptcy is filed —
and for any tax year ending before that — is property of the estate, even
though you don’t receive the refund until after the petition date. (Actually, a
refund is prorated for the year in which the bankruptcy is filed. If, for exam-
ple, you filed November 18, which is the 323rd day of the year, ƒ323/365ths 
of the refund would be property of the estate.)
You can sometimes avoid this problem by delaying bankruptcy until you’ve
received your refunds and spent the money. Another possibility would be to
elect, prior to bankruptcy, to apply your refund to the next year’s taxes. A few
courts have said that doing so prevents the refund from becoming an asset of
the bankruptcy estate, but that sentiment isn’t necessarily universal. Before
relying on this strategy, be sure to check with your lawyer.
If you want to get your refund prior to filing bankruptcy, steer clear of Rapid
Refunds outfits or refund anticipation loans offered by many tax preparation
services. If you electronically file your return and authorize direct bank
deposit of your refund, you can receive your refund within about two weeks
and avoid the stiff fees that come with instant refunds. You get your money
just as soon, without paying any fees, just by doing it yourself. Unfortunately,
things aren’t quite as simple here when you owe the government money.
They never are.
169
Chapter 10: Understanding Which Assets Are Off Limits to Creditors

The IRS has the right to deduct any taxes you owe from your refund.
Furthermore, several federal statutes give other government agencies this
same right. If you’re in default on a guaranteed student loan, the government
will try to take your refund. Additionally, if you owe back child support, local
support enforcement agencies (such as the district attorney’s office) may be
able to snatch your refund. In fact, refunds to which you become entitled to
for tax years after the petition date may be in jeopardy, unless you’re able to
eliminate the debt in bankruptcy (see Chapter 15).
Earned income credits
The earned income credit (EIC) was designed as an incentive for poor people
to work. It creates a refundable tax credit for low-income workers. Whenever
you fall into this category, the government essentially pretends that you had
more pay withheld than you actually did and then gives some of it back to
you. The money is refunded as though it was part of a tax overpayment. So,
even if you didn’t have any taxes withheld, you still may be able to claim to 
a refund. Keep in mind that the same brainiacs who came up with that logic
wrote the bankruptcy laws.
The courts haven’t quite decided how to handle EICs. Although they resem-
ble income tax refunds, EICs are actually a form of government assistance for
needy individuals.
Typically, no exemption specifically covers earned income credits. But some
courts have applied exemptions for welfare benefits or public assistance.
Some have said that EICs are exempt as child support. One court held that 
an EIC was covered under the state’s exemption for personal earnings.
Retirement accounts
The Bankruptcy Code protects most legitimate pensions, including IRAs up 
to $1 million. Rollovers from one plan to another are also protected if they’re
made within 60 days of any distribution and otherwise comply with the provi-
sions of the Internal Revenue Code. These protections apply even in states
that don’t allow other Bankruptcy Code exemptions.
Education savings plans
Funds placed in a tax-qualified education savings plan for the benefit of your
child, stepchild, grandchild, or stepgrandchild are excluded from the estate
as long as the funds were deposited more than 365 days before bankruptcy.
Funds deposited between 720 and 365 days before bankruptcy are protected
only up to $5,000
170
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Creating Exemptions
To a limited degree, the law allows some prebankruptcy planning to maxi-
mize exemptions.
For example, if you had $1,000 in a bank account, which was not covered by
an exemption, you’d lose it to a Chapter 7 trustee. But if you took that $1,000
and made extra payments on your mortgage before filing bankruptcy, the
increase in your homestead may be exempt.
Exemption planning is an extremely complicated and unsettled area of the
law. If you go too far, the consequences are serious, including denial of dis-
charge, denial of the exemption, or reversal of the transaction.
BARF reduces the amount of a debtor’s homestead for any equity accumu-
lated in that property by liquidating other assets that were not exempt if
done
 Within ten years of bankruptcy and
 With the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors
Prior to BARF, courts often found fraud when someone liquidated all his
assets and paid off a mortgage, especially in states with an unlimited home-
stead exemption.
A number of courts have ruled that a little exemption planning is all right, but
the wholesale sheltering of assets that would otherwise go to pay creditors
may run afoul of the rule that pigs get fat, while hogs get slaughtered.
Bottom line: Consult a bankruptcy attorney before engaging in any prebank-
ruptcy planning.
The difference between converting your property into exempt assets that
you continue to own and placing property in someone else’s name is a 
huge one.
Transferring property to someone else is considered fraudulent if the court
thinks that you did it just to keep assets out of the reach of creditors. Don’t
make any gifts or sell any property for less than it’s worth before you file for
bankruptcy. If you’ve already done so, be sure to tell your bankruptcy lawyer.
(We discuss this topic more in the Chapter 19.)

Chapter 11
Dealing with Secured Debts
In This Chapter
 Looking at liens
 Wiping out liens through bankruptcy
 Handling liens on your car and household goods
T
he three people who may have an interest in one of your assets are
 You (obviously)
 The bankruptcy trustee as a representative of unsecured creditors
(those who don’t have dibs on your car, house, or other belongings)
 A secured creditor — one who holds a lien
In simplest terms, a lien is a legal claim in which someone else owns a por-
tion of a particular asset that serves as collateral for the debt. You voluntarily
create some liens, like your mortgage or car loan. Others are imposed against
you. For example, if you lost a lawsuit and a judgment was entered against
you, that judgment probably created a lien against your home. Similarly, if
you fail to pay property taxes, the local government may obtain a lien against
your property.
Bankruptcy won’t automatically make a lien disappear. So, if you file bank-
ruptcy, you may end up wiping out the debt but still losing assets that have
liens on them. Consider your car loan, for example. Filing bankruptcy wipes
out your obligation to pay the loan, but the lender can still get the car when
you don’t pay.
This chapter spotlights liens, the headaches they can cause when they “lien
on you,” and how, in some instances, you can cast them aside. In Chapter 12
of this book, we explore how this works when the lien is against your home.

Getting the Lowdown on Liens
Generally, you face two types of creditors, unsecured and secured, in bank-
ruptcy cases.
An unsecured creditor, such as a credit-card company or medical provider, has
no specific claim or right to your property. A secured creditor has some lever-
age. Your debt to him is backed up, or secured, by a specific asset that serves
as collateral for the debt. That security interest, in legalese, encumbers your
property with a lien. Put another way, your ownership of the property is con-
ditional — the condition being that if you don’t repay the loan, the creditor
can go after the collateral, or property that secures your debt.
When you finance a car, you and the lender share ownership of the vehicle.
As long as you continue making the payments, you’re entitled to possession.
You don’t have the right to sell it out from under the lender, and if you don’t
make the payments, the lender can take the car. After the debt is paid off, the
lender no longer has a claim on the car, the lien is released, and the vehicle is
yours free and clear.
Perfecting liens
When a lien is placed on your asset, the law usually requires the lien holder
to take certain steps to warn others that it possesses some of the ownership
rights associated with the collateral. When these steps are taken, the lien is
considered perfected. Some sort of public recording or notation is usually
required.
For example, your home mortgage isn’t perfected until the mortgage docu-
ment is recorded with the county. Likewise, in most states, a security interest
in a motor vehicle isn’t perfected until the creditor is listed as a lien holder
on the certificate of title.
Perfection is an important concept to understand because bankruptcy
trustees have the power to eliminate unperfected liens and take over that
creditor’s (the lien holder’s) ownership rights. (See Chapter 19.)
Seeing liens as double-edged swords
A lien holder’s firepower comes from two sources: you and the collateral. By
promising to pay the debt, and most likely signing a promissory note, you
accept personal liability. And by agreeing to a lien, you have given the lender
an actual ownership interest in your property.
174
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Putting it into practical terms, if you owe $10,000 on a car that’s worth only
$7,000, and you don’t make the payments, the lender can
 Forget about the car and sue you for the full $10,000
 Take advantage of the lien and repossess the car
 Do both, which, in general, is the most likely avenue of pursuit by the
lender
And why not? Then, the lender can repossess the car and sell it for, say,
$7,000, apply the money to the debt, and come after you for the balance
on the promissory note. Talk about having their cake and eating it, too!
Ordinarily, bankruptcy wipes out your personal liability on the debt, but it
won’t eliminate the creditor’s lien. Although the creditor can no longer go
after your personal obligation, it can go after its collateral. Using the example
in the previous bulleted list, after you file bankruptcy, the creditor can still
repossess the car but can’t come after you for the debt itself. So, the cash in
your wallet is safe; the car in your garage is not.
The Bankruptcy Code enables you to eliminate liens on household goods and
tools of your trade in some situations and to reduce liens in other cases —
depending on what kind of lien it is.
Identifying Different Kinds of Liens
Liens can take a variety of forms, including mortgage liens, mechanic’s liens,
artisan’s liens, judicial liens, and tax liens. However, all liens fall in one or the
other of two categories — consensual or nonconsensual. And to complicate
matters a little more, there are two types of consensual liens — purchase-
money liens and nonpurchase-money security liens. These types of liens are
typically called purchase-money and nonpurchase-money security interests.
Consensual liens
Consensual liens are liens that you voluntarily grant to someone else. When
they involve personal property, such as your car or television, they’re called
security interests. In the case of real property (like your house), they’re usu-
ally called mortgages or deeds of trust.
Here’s how consensual liens work.
175
Chapter 11: Dealing with Secured Debts

First, start with the understanding that the bank doesn’t give you a mortgage
to buy a home; rather, you give the bank a mortgage. When you signed your
mortgage papers, you gave the lender a lien, thereby giving away some of
your ownership rights. You retained the right of possession and granted the
lender the right to some of the proceeds if you decide to sell the property.
Got that?
Now, by giving the bank a mortgage, you also made your ownership condi-
tional. So, because the bank lent you money, you, in turn, agreed that it could
take possession and sell the property if you didn’t pay back the loan. As a
result, you and the mortgage holder simultaneously have ownership inter-
ests, albeit different and sometimes competing ones. Similarly, whenever you
grant a lender a security interest on your car, you give up some of your own-
ership rights.
Consensual liens come in two varieties:
 Purchase-money security interests, in which proceeds of a loan are
used to purchase a specific item
 Nonpurchase-money security interests, which attach to property you
already own
When you charge items at some department stores, you often give the store a
purchase-money security interest in the merchandise that you buy. Similarly,
if you borrow money from a finance company for the express purpose of
buying a car that you’ll use to secure the loan, it, too, is a purchase-money
security interest.
If, for example, you charge a microwave oven on your department store
account, you probably agree that the store can take back the appliance if you
don’t pay off what you owe. On the other hand, if you charged the oven on a
general-purpose credit card (such as MasterCard or Visa), to which typically
no security interest is attached, neither the store nor the credit-card com-
pany can repossess the oven, even if you don’t pay for it. You still owe the
money, however, and you can surely be sued for what you owe, but nobody
can take your microwave or force you to sell it to cover the debt.
Lenders who specialize in relatively small loans to consumers typically
require that the borrower give them a lien (security interest) in all their (the
borrowers) household goods. This lien is a nonpurchase-money security
interest because you didn’t borrow the money to purchase the household
goods; you already owned them. In theory, this stipulation gives the loan
company the right to seize and sell all these items. As you see in the “Freeing
your household goods and tools from liens” section later in this chapter, it
doesn’t usually turn out that way in practice.
176
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Nonconsensual liens
Sometimes the law gives creditors a lien on your property without your con-
sent. The gall! These legal shackles are called nonconsensual liens.
Real property taxes, for example, are liens against your property even though
you never directly consent. The same is true of a judgment lien. When a judg-
ment is entered against you in some courts, it becomes a lien against your
real property, which secures payment of that judgment. (See the “Banging 
the Gavel on Judgment Liens” section later in this chapter to find out how 
to eliminate this type of lien in bankruptcy.)
Dealing with Liens in Bankruptcy
Although liens can seem indelible, the Bankruptcy Code provides you with
special powers to remove them from exempt household goods, tools, and
homesteads. See Chapter 10 for more on exempt assets.
Freeing your household goods 
and tools from liens
Recognizing the difference between purchase-money and nonpurchase-money
security interests (see the section, “Consensual liens,” earlier in this chapter)
can help you hang on to your household goods and tools.
Generally, you can’t avoid a purchase-money security interest when you file
bankruptcy. But you could redeem, reaffirm, or if you purchased the item
more than one year (910 days for motor vehicles purchased for “personal
use”) prior to bankruptcy, pay the value of the collateral over three to five
years in a Chapter 13 repayment plan.
On the other hand, you can eliminate nonpurchase-money security interests
in some exempt household goods, largely because creditors really don’t want
your stuff and it’s not really worth all that much. Consumer finance compa-
nies use these security interests for leverage, so they can threaten to take all
your belongings if you don’t pay. The Bankruptcy Code allows you to free
these items from nonpurchase money security interests:
 Clothing
 Furniture
177
Chapter 11: Dealing with Secured Debts

 Appliances
 One radio
 One television
 One VCR
 Linens
 China
 Crockery
 Kitchenware
 Educational materials and educational equipment primarily for the use
of your minor dependent children
 Medical equipment and supplies
 Furniture exclusively for the use of your minor children, or elderly or
disabled dependents
 Personal effects (including the toys and hobby equipment of minor depen-
dent children and wedding rings) used by you or your dependents.
 One personal computer and related equipment
You cannot avoid even nonpurchase money security interests in
 Works of art (unless created by you or a relative)
 Electronic entertainment equipment worth more than $500 total (except
for one TV, radio, and VCR)
 Antiques worth more than $500 total
 Jewelry worth more than $500 total (except wedding rings)
 A computer (except as provided in the preceding list), motor vehicle
(including a tractor or lawn tractor), or a motorized recreational vehicle,
water craft, or aircraft.
If a security interest isn’t avoidable, the creditor asks you to reaffirm the debt
in order to keep your possessions. But you have a couple of other options
depending on the size of the debt and value of the collateral. You can
 Pay that creditor the value of the items. For example, if you had several
televisions worth about $300 total but owed $1,000, you could pay $300
keep the TVs and wipe out the balance of the debt. In Chapter 7, you
have to come up with the money within 30 days of the 341 meeting. In
Chapter 13, you pay this sum over the life of the plan. BARF contains a
178
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

special exception for pawn shops, however. Neither Chapter 13 cram-
down (where you pay the value of the item, not necessarily the amount
you owe) nor Chapter 7 redemption is available as to property pledged
at a pawn shop. In this situation, you have repay the entire debt or give
the item back.
 Call the creditor’s bluff and tell it to come and get its stuff. In many
cases, the company simply won’t bother.
Redeeming (getting back) your property
If you can’t simply remove a lien, you can still redeem consumer goods by
paying the creditor not the amount of the debt, but rather its value. Personal
property depreciates so quickly that its value almost is always less than the
amount of the debt. Say, for example, that you charged a $1,000 home enter-
tainment system and gave the store a purchase-money security interest in
the unit. Instead of paying the full $1,000 to keep the system, you can pay the
store only its value, which, by the time you take it home, is probably half
what it was in the store.
In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, this payment must be made in a lump sum and
within 30 days of the 341 meeting after your case is filed, unless the creditor
agrees otherwise.
Automobiles are usually consumer goods and can be redeemed by paying
their value rather than the full amount of the debt. In recent years, a few
lenders have come up with the idea of redemption financing, where they make
you a new loan to redeem your car from the existing lender. This financing
may be a good deal because the amount of the new loan is based solely on
the value of your car. Say, for example, that you owe $12,000 to ABC Credit
Union on a car that’s worth only $8,000. You borrow $8,000 from the redemp-
tion finance company to redeem the car from ABC, and you then end up
owing only $8,000 rather than the original $12,000. Your lawyer can help
guide you to a reputable redemption financing lender if one is in your area, 
or you can check out a company called 722 Redemption Funding, Inc., www.
722redemption.com/, 1-888-721-2800.
If you and the creditor can’t agree on how much the item is worth, a bank-
ruptcy judge decides.
Reaffirming your debts
If you can’t eliminate a lien, don’t have the cash to redeem it, and don’t want
to tether yourself to a Chapter 13 repayment plan, you can reaffirm and
179
Chapter 11: Dealing with Secured Debts

promise to pay the debt even though it would otherwise be wiped out during
bankruptcy. However, reaffirming means that if you fall behind on the pay-
ments after bankruptcy, the creditor can repossess the collateral, sell it, and
come after you for any shortfall.
Using the Special Powers Afforded
Chapter 13 Filers
In Chapter 13, you can modify some liens and restructure loans that can’t be
completely eliminated.
If your car loan isn’t a purchase-money security interest, you bought the car
for some purpose other than personal use (perhaps for your kids or spouse
to use or for use in a business), or if you got a purchase-money loan more
than 910 days prior to bankruptcy, you can pay the value of the car, not the
outstanding loan balance, over the life of a Chapter 13 plan. Say that you bor-
rowed $5,000 from a finance company and pledged a car you owned free and
clear as collateral. If the car’s retail value was worth only $2,000 when you
filed bankruptcy, you could keep the vehicle by paying just $2,000, not $5,000.
The same result applies if you acquired the car with the loan, but did so more
than 910 days prior to bankruptcy. By contrast, if you got the purchase-
money loan less than 910 day before bankruptcy, you’d have to pay the 
whole loan of $5,000 in order to keep the car.
Similarly, if you bought a washing machine on a department store charge
account more than one year before bankruptcy, you could keep it by simply
paying its value (the price a secondhand merchant would charge) over the
three- to five-year life of your plan. But if you purchased the washing machine
within one year of bankruptcy, you’d have to pay the full amount still owed
on the purchase price.
We talk about modifying home mortgages in Chapter 12.
Dealing with Rent-to-Own Contracts
Rent-to-own contracts are similar to purchase-money security interests, but
they’re set up as leases.
With these contracts, you lease a specific item, make periodic rent payments,
and, at the end of the contract, end up owning whatever it is you rented.
180
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

When a transaction is a true lease, the only way you can keep the item is to
make all the payments. You can’t redeem the property in a Chapter 7, and
you can’t just pay its value in a Chapter 13. However, in a Chapter 13, you can
make up back payments and make all future payments on time if you want to
keep the item.
Lenders know that they make out better if a transaction is a lease rather than
one involving a security interest and frequently label transactions “leases”
when they actually are security interests. Most courts say that a transaction
is not a true lease unless you’re allowed to cancel the deal at any time and
return the merchandise without further obligation. Your lawyer needs to
examine the fine print to see whether a transaction is a true lease or a clev-
erly disguised security interest.
Banging the Gavel on Judgment Liens
If you lose a lawsuit and the other side is awarded money, a judicial lien (a
form of judgment lien) may be imposed. Sometimes, a lien is automatically
placed on all your real estate the moment a judgment is entered against you.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, you can eliminate a judgment lien to the extent
that it impairs your homestead exemption.
Consider this example. Assume that your home is worth $75,000, is subject to
a mortgage lien of $55,000, and that your state’s homestead exemption (which
protects at least some of the value of your home) is $30,000. Further assume
that you owe $15,000 in medical bills.
If the equity in your home is $20,000, you can file bankruptcy, discharge the
medical bills, and keep your home by continuing to pay the mortgage. Neat
and clean!
But, say that the hospital sued you before you filed bankruptcy and obtained
a judgment lien for $15,000. That lien could cause problems down the road if
the equity in your home grew beyond the amount allowed by your home-
stead exemption. Then if you wanted to sell or refinance your home, you’d
have to pay the judgment lien as well as your mortgage.
Congress thought that this consequence was too harsh, especially because 
a judgment lien is nonconsensual. As a result, the Bankruptcy Code allows
debtors to eliminate judgment liens that may impair homesteads. If the debtor
in our example took advantage of these provisions, it would be as if no judg-
ment lien had ever hit his property. In other words, to keep his house, all he
must do is pay the mortgage even if the value of the house increases above
181
Chapter 11: Dealing with Secured Debts

the homestead exemption. The hospital bill gets wiped our along with all the
other debts and doesn’t come back to haunt you when the time comes to refi-
nance or sell your home.
Beware, however, that the rules about avoiding judgment liens do not apply
to judgment liens entered by divorce courts for alimony or child support.
Forget about avoiding those kinds of judgment liens.

H
ome ownership is an integral part of the American Dream. The
Bankruptcy Code recognizes the importance of owning a home and
strives to strike a delicate balance between the sometimes competing inter-
ests of mortgage companies that finance home purchases, other creditors,
and, of course, the homeowners.
In this chapter, we look at what can happen to your home when you file bank-
ruptcy and explain how bankruptcy can prevent foreclosure — that nasty situ-
ation when lenders take your home.
When you’re struggling to make ends meet, refinancing your home or taking
out a home-equity loan may seem like a great option — and maybe it is.
However, we suggest that you explore your bankruptcy options first. (See
Chapter 7 for more about refinancing.)
Your Home, Your Castle — and
Sometimes Your Hassle
You probably see your home as a memory-filled place of refuge for you and
your family, but others view it through different eyes — cold, calculating
ones. Typically, they focus on the equity in your house — the difference
between its value and the amount owed on mortgages and liens against it.

Three entities that may claim an interest in your home are
 You
 Secured creditors — including mortgage holders and other lien holders,
such as judgment creditors
 The bankruptcy trustee, to the extent that its value exceeds the allow-
able homestead exemption
The three things that you need to know before assessing your options are
 The value of your property
 The amount of any mortgages or other liens against the property
 The homestead exemption that applies to your situation
Figuring out how much your home is worth
Bankruptcy offers various options with regard to your homestead. But before
you can figure which works best for your situation, you need an objective
appraisal of the dollars and cents value of your home. That can be a tough
number to find. If you recently purchased your home, the selling price is
some indication of its value. Some. Depending on where you live, a good
starting point for determining the value of your real property may be the tax
assessment. Unfortunately, in some parts of the country, values used by tax
assessors bear almost no relationship to reality.
Be wary, however, of estimates from real estate brokers who may be more
inclined to overstate the value of your home hoping to land a selling job.
Similarly, don’t blindly accept appraisals made in connection with home-
equity loans. Home-equity appraisals routinely are inflated so that the lender
can justify giving you a larger loan than you probably can’t afford.
If you did not recently purchase your home or if you live in a community
where property tax assessments are out of whack, you have to hire a real
estate appraiser. This way, you get an expert opinion from someone with 
no ulterior motives.
Deducting mortgages and other liens 
that affect your share of the pie
Liens for mortgages, real property taxes, federal taxes, or judgments go against
the value of your home, and lien holders have first dibs on any proceeds if you
sell the property. They must be paid in full before you or other creditors get
184
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

anything from the sale of your home. The amounts of any liens need to be
deducted from the value of the property so that you can determine how much
equity you have. You may want to refer to Chapter 11, where we take an up
close and personal look at liens.
Understanding the homestead exemption
Homestead-exemption laws protect a person’s home from those creditors
who don’t have liens against the property. For example, if your home is worth
$120,000 and you owe $100,000 on the mortgage, your equity in the home is
$20,000. So, if the applicable homestead exemption were $20,000 or more,
your home would be protected from the bankruptcy trustee and creditors
other than the mortgage holder.
Almost every jurisdiction has some type of homestead exemption; however,
notable exceptions include Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Some
jurisdictions permit you to choose exemptions contained in the U.S. Bank-
ruptcy Code or those provided by your state law. In other places, you’re
restricted to the exemptions recognized by your state and the federal exemp-
tions aren’t available. (Appendix A summarizes the exemptions state-by-state
and provides a list of federal exemptions.)
Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota, and Texas have unlimited
homestead exemptions. If you live in one of those states, your home may
be sheltered regardless of its value. But it’s complicated.
If you acquired your present home within 1,215 days of bankruptcy, your
homestead exemption may not exceed $125,000, even if state law allows
more. In most cases, this amount isn’t a problem because only a few states
have such large homestead exemptions. But this restriction is limited to the
extent that you used the proceeds of a prior homestead in the same state to
purchase your present home — unless, of course, the first residence was also
acquired within 1,215 days of bankruptcy.
For example, assume that you moved to Florida in 1995 and bought a home
for $500,000 cash. Then, in 2005, you sold this home and used the money to
buy a new home in Florida for $500,000. The $125,000 limitation would not
apply even if you filed bankruptcy within 1,215 days of acquiring your new
home.
There is also an absolute $125,000 cap on homesteads if you’ve been con-
victed of certain federal securities law provisions or committed criminal acts
or other intentional or reckless acts that caused serious injury or death
within five years of bankruptcy.
185
Chapter 12: Saving Your Home

Although the Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco law of 2005 is not clear on 
the subject, we’re guessing that if a husband and wife own their homestead
together and file a joint bankruptcy, the $125,000 limit may be doubled to
$250,000.
But if you don’t live in an unlimited-homestead state, the picture may not be so
rosy. Although some states have a homestead exemption as high as $500,000
(Massachusetts), homestead exemptions in some states don’t amount to a hill
of beans. In Michigan, for example, the homestead exemption is a measly
$3,500.
The amount allowed for a homestead exemption is reduced to the extent that
equity in that home was created with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud
creditors within ten years before bankruptcy. If, for example, a person who
was being hounded by creditors liquidated her $25,000 stock portfolio and
used the money to either pay down a mortgage on an existing home or pur-
chase a new home with the money, any homestead exemption would be
reduced by $25,000. This restriction supplements existing court decisions
placing limits on prebankruptcy exemption planning (see Chapter 10).
Sometimes, the effective amount of your exemption may actually be more
than the amount specified in exemption statutes. The reason? When the
trustee sells your property, he is responsible for paying a commission to any
real estate agent he hires. Commissions and other costs of sale can be as
high as 10 percent of the selling price of your home and they must be paid
from the trustee’s share of the sale proceeds, not from the share covered by
your homestead exemption.
Occasionally, a court must decide whether an unusual type of residence qual-
ifies for homestead exemption. Not surprisingly, courts frequently disagree.
Houseboats, for example, seem to confound the courts. Some judges say
they’re exempt as homesteads; others say they’re not.
Another frequent question is whether you can exempt living quarters where
you’ve rented out part of your abode or used another part of your residence
for income-producing activities. Most courts agree that the mere fact that a
person rents out a room or portion of his home doesn’t impair the exemp-
tion. Other courts, however, differ.
Some states require you to actually reside in the dwelling, but others 
permit temporary absences or require only that a family member live there.
Sometimes determining whether someone lives on the property is difficult.
For example, does a debtor actually live on vacant land when he’s staying in 
a camper on the property but intends to build a home? Some courts would
rule that he doesn’t live there; therefore, the land is not exempt.
186
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

If you’ve lived in your present state less than two years, the exemption law of
your prior state may be the one that applies (see Chapter 10).
Table 12-1 helps determine if a bankruptcy trustee has any claim to your
home — whether you have nonexempt home equity that could be seized for
your creditors.

Dealing with Jointly Owned Property
In noncommunity-property states (all except Arizona, California, Idaho,
Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin), when a
married couple jointly owns a homestead, but only one spouse files bank-
ruptcy, the other spouse’s interest in the property doesn’t come into play in
the bankruptcy. Although courts disagree about how to calculate a dollar
figure for the interest of one spouse, you can come up with a ballpark figure
by deducting mortgages and liens from the value of your property, dividing
the remainder by two, and applying your homestead exemption against this
figure. The following sections show you what happens in some practical
examples.
187
Chapter 12: Saving Your Home

If you own property solely in your name, don’t try to put it in the names of
both you and your spouse (without first talking to a bankruptcy lawyer).
Doing so can be considered a fraudulent transfer (see Chapter 19).
Example 1: When the homestead exemp-
tion is larger than your equity
Assume that your home is worth $100,000 and you owe $70,000 on the mort-
gage, which means that the equity in your home is $30,000 and your half
would be $15,000. If your state’s homestead exemption is $20,000, your prop-
erty is entirely exempt because the amount of your equity is less than the
amount of the homestead exemption.
Example 2: When your equity is larger
than your homestead exemption
Assume that your property is worth $160,000 and that you owe $70,000 on
the mortgage, meaning that the equity in your property is $90,000, with your
half being $45,000. If the homestead exemption still is $20,000, you have
nonexempt home equity available to creditors.
In the example in the previous paragraph, if a Chapter 7 trustee can find a
buyer for your one-half interest for, say $45,000, the buyer can pay you
$20,000 and distribute $25,000 to creditors to become a joint owner with your
spouse. The trustee must, however, give your spouse a chance to match this
offer before actually selling the property.
When a buyer for your one-half interest can’t be found, the trustee can ask
the court for permission to sell the entire interest in the property, pay the
mortgage, give your spouse his or her share, pay you your exemption, and
distribute the balance to creditors. In this situation, instead of sharing owner-
ship with a new buyer, your spouse receives cash for his or her share.
As a practical matter, the likelihood that a trustee can find a buyer for a one-
half interest in your homestead is minimal, or even less. Furthermore, courts
are reluctant to grant a trustee’s request to sell a nondebtor spouse’s interest
in the marital home. So, a nondebtor may be able to buy the estate’s interest
in the property from the trustee for significantly less than the previous exam-
ples suggest, especially when you consider that the trustee has to pay a real
estate agent’s commission whenever the property is listed for sale.
188
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

From a debtor’s perspective, things are even better in jurisdictions that 
recognize a tenancy by the entireties exemption. In Delaware, the District of
Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and
Wyoming, when only one spouse files bankruptcy and no creditors have claims
against both spouses, the property is fully exempt. Regardless of its value or
whether it qualifies as a homestead, you can keep your home.
The bottom line: One spouse filing for bankruptcy with the other one avoid-
ing it can prove advantageous. Be sure to discuss this angle with your lawyer.
The rules pertaining to jointly owned property are different — and some-
what less favorable — when you live in Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana,
Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, or Wisconsin, the nine community
property states, where even the nondebtor’s interest in community property
becomes property of the estate. If the community property isn’t fully covered
by an exemption, the trustee can sell it. Your home probably is considered
community property when it’s obtained during the marriage, unless one
spouse inherited the property.
Understanding How Foreclosures Work
In weighing your bankruptcy options, you need to know a little about the
nitty-gritty of foreclosure. Although procedures vary from state to state, fore-
closure typically begins when the lender commences a lawsuit initiating
what’s known as a judicial foreclosure or files documents with the county
clerk or another local official and mails copies to you, the borrower, in the
case of a nonjudicial foreclosure.
But that’s only the beginning. State laws require a public auction, referred to
as a foreclosure sale, and public notice of that auction. In other words, the
mortgage gremlin can’t just auction off your house to his relatives at a no-
contest auction. But even though a foreclosure sale is open to public bidding,
the lender typically places the only bid. The time between commencement of
a foreclosure proceeding and the actual sale rarely is less than three months
and frequently is longer. During this period, you still own the property.
In some situations, depending on the method of foreclosure and require-
ments of state law, the borrower still may be able to redeem the property
after a foreclosure sale by paying the full amount bid at the sale. After the
foreclosure process is complete, however, the successful bidder can evict 
the borrower from the premises.
189
Chapter 12: Saving Your Home

Heading off the Homewreckers
Because holding on to your home may be a number-one priority, evaluating
the differences between filing Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 makes sense. We
designed the following sections to clarify the distinctions.
Keeping your home in Chapter 7
If you’re current with your mortgage payments, and the value of your home is
covered by your state’s homestead exemption, Chapter 7 bankruptcy may be
the way to go. By getting rid of most of your other debts, keeping up with the
mortgage will be just that much easier.
Filing Chapter 7 usually is quick, easy, final, and helps you avoid the repay-
ment responsibility that comes with Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
Keeping your home in Chapter 13
If you need time to catch up on back mortgage payments, Chapter 13 is prob-
ably the recipe you’re looking for because you then can make up late pay-
ments over the three- to five-year life of your bankruptcy plan. But remember
that you must keep up with all future mortgage payments.
Additionally, whenever your equity is more than your state’s allowable
exemption, you don’t want to file Chapter 7 because you’d probably lose
your home to the trustee.
For example, say that your house is worth $100,000, your mortgage balance is
$60,000, and the homestead exemption is $25,000. If you file Chapter 7, the
trustee can sell your house, pay off the mortgage, hand you $25,000 for your
homestead exemption, and distribute the remaining $15,000 to creditors. In
Chapter 13, you keep your home and pay creditors the same $15,000 they
would have received in Chapter 7, but you have three to five years in which
to do it.
Making up back payments: The “cure” for your ailment
A cure is the process of paying the amount that you’re behind on your mort-
gage (arrearage) over the course of a Chapter 13 case. For example, if you’re
behind by five $1,000 mortgage payments as of the date of your bankruptcy,
you can gradually pay off the $5,000 arrearage over the three to five years of
a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan.
190
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

After you file Chapter 13, in addition to chipping away at the arrearage, you
must also resume your current payments. Continuing with the previous para-
graph’s example, say that your mortgage payments are due on the tenth of the
month, that you file Chapter 13 on May 15, and that the arrearage consists of
payments you missed for January, February, March, April, and May. Under
those circumstances, you have to make your regular payments, starting with
the one due on June 10, in addition to your payments on the arrearage.
If foreclosure proceedings already were started, you still can proffer a cure by
filing Chapter 13 before the property is sold at a foreclosure sale. (See the
“Understanding How Foreclosures Work” section, earlier in this chapter.) One
problem is that courts disagree on precisely when this sale occurs. A foreclo-
sure, by its very nature, is a public auction. When the bidding stops, the auc-
tioneer declares the property “sold to the highest bidder” (which is usually
the mortgage holder bidding all or part of the amount it is owed). However,
depending on local procedures, additional steps may be required to complete
the process. In some places, a state court judge must confirm that the fore-
closure was properly conducted. In addition, a deed must be delivered to the
high bidder, who must properly record it in public records.
That said, some courts rule that if you don’t file a Chapter 13 before the 
winning bid is accepted, it’s too late for a cure. Others say that cure remains
a possibility when a Chapter 13 is filed before all the additional steps are
completed.
Filing a Chapter 13 well in advance of the foreclosure sale date usually is best
because you’re assured that it won’t be too late. Filing early also saves you
money. Mortgage documents typically require you to pay the lender’s costs
and attorney fees for the foreclosure proceedings. When you file late in the
process, these amounts are added to the arrearage.
Even after a foreclosure sale, you may still have a shot at saving your house 
if your state provides for a right of redemption, an opportunity for you to
redeem real property, even after it’s sold at foreclosure. Depending on the
state and method of foreclosure, you may have a period of time, usually six
months to a year, to exercise a right of redemption. Note: A right of redemp-
tion is not to be confused with the right to redeem personal property under
the Bankruptcy Code, which we explain in Chapter 11.
Remember, however, the difference between redemption and cure. When 
you cure, you only have to make up the missed payments; you don’t have 
to pay the whole loan. And you can take up to five years to make up the 
back payments.
191
Chapter 12: Saving Your Home

Redemption, on the other hand, essentially requires you pay the entire out-
standing balance of the loan, and you can’t stretch payments over the life of
the plan. The entire debt has to be paid before the redemption period, which
in some states may be only a few months, expires. Your only option in this
situation would be to try to find a lender who would advance you the amount
needed to redeem the property.
The answer to the question of whether you have redemption rights following
a foreclosure depends on local law, so don’t count on having the right to
redeem without first checking with a local lawyer.
With all this to consider, contacting a lawyer as soon as possible after foreclo-
sure procedures are threatened is essential. Then you and your attorney can
discuss the pending deadlines and plan your strategy accordingly.
Modifying home mortgages: Special restrictions
Sometimes you can restructure mortgages in a Chapter 13, but special
restrictions sometimes apply when modifying residential mortgages. If they
do apply, the only modification allowed is making up back payments under
the plan and continuing to make all future regular monthly payments after
the petition date.
The following mortgages aren’t entitled to special residential mortgage 
protection:
 Loans secured by other property in addition to your home: For exam-
ple, a lender may take a security interest in your $100 junk car in addi-
tion to the mortgage. That decision — and it’s not all that unusual — can
cost the bank a bundle. If your home was worth $75,000 and you owed
$100,000 on a mortgage that was not entitled to protection as a residen-
tial mortgage, a Chapter 13 can enable you to reduce the principal
amount of the loan balance to the value of your home ($75,000). If the
mortgage were entitled to protection, you’d eventually end up paying
the entire $100,000 to keep your home.
Sometimes lenders, sensing an approaching bankruptcy, discover their
blunders and magnanimously offer to release collateral like the junk car.
Don’t let them without first talking to a lawyer.
 Loans that are due, or will come due, during the next five years: This
is common with home-equity loans requiring balloon payments where
you make really small payments for a few years, basically covering only
the interest, and then have to pay off the entire balloon portion of the
loan in a lump sum.
192
Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

 Loans that in reality are completely unsecured because the property
is fully encumbered by prior mortgages: Lenders of first mortgages
usually won’t approve loans that are more than the property is worth.
Lenders of second mortgages, on the other hand, are more inclined to
gamble, often stupidly. These home-equity lenders are so blinded by the
prospect of making a highly profitable loan that they don’t seriously con-
sider whether the property already is fully encumbered.
When your home isn’t worth more than the first mortgage, many courts
conclude that a second mortgage isn’t protected and may be eliminated.
But if your property is worth as little as a buck more than the amount
due on the first mortgage, the entire second mortgage is protected and
must be paid if you want to keep your home. For example, if you owe
$75,000 on a first mortgage and $25,000 on a second, you can eliminate
the second mortgage if your home was worth $75,000 or less, but if it
was worth $75,001, the second mortgage is protected. Note: Courts dis-
agree on whether the property should be valued as of the time the loan
was made, or as of the petition date.
Your options when the restrictions on modifying 
home mortgages don’t apply
In situations where the restrictions on modifying home mortgages don’t
apply, you can actually restructure and possibly reduce your mortgage. 
You can
 Propose to suspend payments until you can sell the property to pay off
the secured claim
 Restructure the debt and reduce the interest rate
 Reduce the balance of the loan through bifurcation (also known as cram-
ming down)
In Chapter 11, we explain the concept of cram-down, a process in which a
Chapter 13 debtor pays the value of collateral rather than the full amount 
of the debt.
When the collateral is real property, this technique is frequently called bifur-
cation, which means “division into two parts,” a secured claim equal to the
value of the property and an unsecured claim for the balance of the debt.
The practice of reducing the secured claim to the value of the collateral is
sometimes referred to as stripoff. Paying the value of the collateral under a
Chapter 13 plan is known as cram-down. For our purposes, stripoff, cram-
down, and bifurcation mean the same thing.
193
Chapter 12: Saving Your Home

Here’s a practical example of bifurcation:
Assume that your property is worth $30,000 and is encumbered by two
mortgages. You owe $25,000 on the first mortgage and $20,000 on the
second. The first mortgage is fully covered by the value of the property,
so it’s considered fully secured and can’t be reduced. But after you
deduct the $25,000 owed on the first mortgage from the value of the prop-
erty, only $5,000 in value remains. As a result, you can strip off or elimi-
nate all but $5,000 of the second mortgage. If you pay the holder of the
second mortgage $5,000 over the course of your Chapter 13 plan, that
mortgage goes away even though you owed $20,000!
Not bad! Too bad that this option is available only in situations where the
special restrictions on modifying home mortgages don’t apply.
Comparing Chapter 7 and Chapter 13
Table 12-2 provides a bird’s eye view to help you decide whether a Chapter 7
or Chapter 13 is the best way to save your home.

Preserving your homestead isn’t always a simple matter, and you can unwit-

contract to sell, making improvements, or allowing a judgment or tax lien to
be filed. And keep in mind that while a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is open — that
is, while you’re making payments — moving, renting your home, or entering
into a contract to sell your home are risky steps to be taking.

work for three months. Nicole’s salary wasn’t
enough to put food on the table and pay the mort-
gage, so they fell behind. Later, when Grant got
back on his feet, they dutifully resumed their pay-
ments, but the bank still wanted to foreclose
because of the three missed payments.
Like a growing number of people, Grant and Nicole
were virtually pushed into bankruptcy by the fool-
ish policy of their mortgage holder. As would be
expected, they filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and
the court protected their home and allowed them
to make up the missed mortgage payments over
three years. The lender got its money, Grant and
Nicole kept their house, and, thanks to sensible
bankruptcy laws, everybody’s happy.

Using Truth-in-Lending Laws
Another federal law gives you the power to cancel liens on your home. It’s
called the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA), which is doubly powerful when used
in conjunction with a Chapter 13 filing.
When you borrow money against your home, the TILA gives you a three-day
cooling off period in which to cancel the transaction. The lender must give
you written notice that you have this right. The TILA also requires the lender
to provide you with written disclosures of finance and other charges related
to your loan.
If a lender doesn’t disclose the required information in connection with a
nonpurchase-money loan, you can cancel the transaction at any time within
the following three years or whenever you sell your home, whichever comes
first.

Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 
“Due on sale” — A snake in the 
grass, and a pain in your . . .
Most mortgages contain a due-on-sale clause that
says if the property is sold or liens are attached to
it, the entire loan becomes due now . . . right now.
Generally, nobody pays any attention to these
clauses — not even the lender — and they’re rou-
tinely ignored. In fact, just about everyone who
obtains a second mortgage violates this provision.
Regardless, it’s a hazard lurking in the tall grass,
like a venomous snake.
Although most lenders won’t bother attempting
to enforce these clauses, a few mortgage cred-
itors scour loan documents searching for due-
on-sale clauses whenever a borrower files
Chapter 13. If you bought your house subject to
an existing mortgage and the seller didn’t obtain
the mortgage company’s consent, or if you have
allowed other liens to attach to the property, the
mortgage company may claim that the loan is in
default and can’t be remedied, even in a
Chapter 13. Many courts are siding — rather
unhappily — with creditors on this issue.
When Archie and Edith bought their home from
Fred and Ethel, they didn’t get their own mort-
gage. Instead they just started making payments
on the existing mortgage. Although the mortgage
company accepted payments from Archie and
Edith, it never gave its official consent to their pur-
chase of the home. The bank neglected to com-
plain until after Archie and Edith filed Chapter 13,
and then it asked for court permission to fore-
close on the grounds that the due-on-sale clause
had been violated. Although acknowledging that
most courts would go the other way, the bank-
ruptcy court in this case ruled against the bank,
so Archie and Edith kept their home.
It was, however, a close call.
So far, only a few mortgage companies have
made this argument, but you still should have
your mortgage documents carefully examined
by a lawyer for possible violations of a due-on-
sale clause so that a strategy for dealing with
the issue can be developed if it ever comes up.

Likewise, if you want to cancel a lien against your home under TILA without
bankruptcy, you must return the money to the lender. However, if you were to
file bankruptcy, some courts allow you to cancel a lien without returning the
money. That’s a great deal — if your local court will play ball. Some do, some
don’t. So don’t make any assumptions.
In addition to the TILA, your state’s truth-in-lending law may cover you. If
your state has such a law, your rights are likely to be greater under the state
statute than they are with the federal provision. Some states enable you to
cancel a lien even though it may be too late to do so under the TILA. Others
aren’t quite so forgiving. Your lawyer can advise you on the best course of
action for your particular case.
Coping When Your Dream Home 
Becomes a Nightmare
Regrettably, more and more people are discovering that they can’t handle
their mortgage payments because they were suckered into taking second
mortgages (home-equity loans) to pay off their credit cards. Paying the first
mortgage and the home-equity mortgage is just too much. They may also
realize that they’ve used up all the equity in their home and now owe more
on mortgages than their houses are worth.
If you’re in this predicament, you have our sympathy. You may have used
your life savings to buy the home, put down roots, and enrolled your children
in the schools of your choice, but now you must think about giving it all up
because you were conned into taking a second mortgage.
197
Chapter 12: Saving Your Home
The Truth-in-Lending Act: An arrow in your quiver
When Claude received a $22,000 home-equity
loan, he agreed to pay a $3,000 fee to the
lender’s agent for arranging the loan. The lender
violated the Truth-in-Lending Act by not includ-
ing this fee in the finance-charge category on
the disclosure statement. Two years later, when
the lender called the loan, Claude’s lawyer gave
notice he was rescinding the loan and filed a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy for Claude. The bank-
ruptcy court canceled the mortgage and wiped
out the debt.

So, now it’s time to bite the bullet and be brutally honest with yourself. If you
try to keep your home when you really can’t afford to make your mortgage
payments, keeping your home may not put you on the road to financial recov-
ery. Struggling to keep up with overwhelming mortgage payments will likely
drag you down again.
Your best choice may be to file under Chapter 7 and allow the mortgage holder
to foreclose. What’s the point in making further payments, provided that you
have someplace to go and the funds to do so? Instead, use the money that
you’d normally pay on the mortgage to find a new place to live or to pay for
moving expenses.
Granted, for a few years, you’ll have trouble getting another mortgage at con-
ventional interest rates, but it will probably take you this long to save up for
a decent down payment. See Chapter 21 for more on repairing your credit.
Creditors sometimes are willing to pay you something for a deed in lieu of
foreclosure so that they can avoid the expenses of foreclosure. In that situa-
tion, you relinquish your interest in the property in exchange for a modest
payment, perhaps $1,000, and agree to move out within a specific period of
time. Although this arrangement may be a good deal, don’t take it without
first exploring the income tax consequences (capital gains taxes) of making
such a transaction (or sale).
Nevertheless, you may still want to keep your home even though you have no
established equity, especially if you think its value will appreciate or if you’re
worried about finding a place to live after your bankruptcy. (We explore ways
of saving your home without filing bankruptcy in Chapter 7.)

Part III: Keeping Your Stuff 

Part IV
Getting Rid of
(Most of) Your Debt

In this part . . .
Your aim is to get rid of your debts, and to a large
extent, bankruptcy does that, even with the more
stringent rules of the law enacted in the fall of 2005. For
the most part, debts incurred before you file bankruptcy
are eliminated, and debts that arise after you file are not.
But when you’re dealing with credit cards — and who
isn’t? — the game’s a little different. Ditto with taxes,
fines, child support, and student loans. This section
reveals those nasty debts that linger like a February flu
and helps position you to get the most relief possible. 

Chapter 13
Lingering Obligations
In This Chapter
 Distinguishing debts from other obligations
 Living with the 60-day bar date
 Borrowing to cover nondischargeable debts
 Knowing about reaffirmation agreements
 Watching out for the ultimate bankruptcy bummer — denial or revocation of discharge
B
ankruptcy may not provide an escape route for each and every one of
your financial obligations. Some debts are much like fly paper. They
seem to stick to you no matter what. Your left foot gets stuck, and when you
try to free that one, the right gets stuck. Try pushing away with your hands,
and your tootsies come free, but now your paws are snared.
Escaping some debts would defy even the talents of Harry Houdini. But
escape from others is possible if you just have the key. This chapter is that
key. In it, we identify obligations that are just plain immune from bankruptcy
and others that you may be able to shuck. You also discover rare situations
in which all a person’s debts survive because his bankruptcy discharge is
denied or revoked.
Recognizing (Possibly) Indelible Debts
In Chapter 11, we look at secured debts, such as those backed up by your
house or car, and explain that auto finance companies and mortgage lenders
can still repossess or foreclose after you file bankruptcy. A handful of other
obligations also survive bankruptcy and stick to you like hot tar, including
 Those that are not technically “debts”
 Debts arising after bankruptcy
 Specific types of debts that the Bankruptcy Code preserves — 
nondischargeable debts

(We devote entire chapters to the most common of these: fraud and
credit-card abuse — Chapters 14 and 16; taxes — Chapter 15; divorce
obligations — Chapter 17; and student loans — Chapter 18.)
 Some debts that were not properly listed on bankruptcy documents
 Any debt you reaffirmed (or reagreed to after bankruptcy)
 All your debts if the court denies or revokes your bankruptcy discharge
However, you can escape some of these sticky debts in some cases:
 By successfully completing a Chapter 13 repayment plan
 By watching for creditors who are asleep at the switch in a Chapter 7
case and miss the deadline (the 60-day bar date) for challenging your
bankruptcy
 By filing a proof of claim (a document that must be filed with the court
before a creditor can receive any payments from the trustee) so that at
least part of the nondischargeable debt is paid by the trustee
But before going on, you must get a handle on the nature of the debt beast so
that you’re better able to tell when you have a real tiger, which bankruptcy
can’t tame, or only a paper feline, which merely requires a little special 
handling.
Confronting obligations enforceable 
by court orders
Start with this premise: Courts usually don’t force people to perform most
contracts; they merely assess damages for nonperformance. For example,
courts won’t order you to pay a loan under penalty of contempt. They simply
enter a judgment against you for some amount of money.
Monetary damages are inadequate where some contracts are concerned. 
For example, if you sold someone your business and signed a noncompete
covenant (agreeing not to open a new competing business) and then turned
around and set up shop across the street, the court may grant an injunction,
which is just a court order where the judge says, with a bit more tact, “Yo, wise
guy, get outta town, or I’m gonna slap you with a fine or toss your butt in jail!”
Similarly, famous performers and prizefighters often agree to work exclu-
sively for one promoter — a promise, enforced by an injunction, not to work
for anyone else.
202
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Most courts say promises that are enforceable by injunctions can’t be
avoided by bankruptcy because no debt — as the law defines it — needs to
be wiped out.
Debts arising after bankruptcy
For the most part, bankruptcy wipes out debts that arise prior to bankruptcy,
but not those arising afterward. Therefore, you need to carefully decide not
only whether you need to file bankruptcy, but also when.
Debts arise when the events causing the liability occur and not when you get
the bill. When you buy something on credit, the debt arises at the moment of
purchase, not when your credit-card statement comes in the mail. Similarly, if
you cause a car wreck, your liability arises when the accident occurred, even
though claims aren’t made against you until much later.
Occasionally, people discover that they filed bankruptcy too soon. For exam-
ple, if you file bankruptcy right before undergoing extensive medical treat-
ment, the medical bills resulting from your treatment won’t be included in the
bankruptcy. Most of the medical bills, it is hoped, are covered by insurance,
and you’ll be able to pay the balance. But you can never be sure. In a situa-
tion like that, postponing bankruptcy until the dust settles and you know
exactly where you stand may be best.
203
Chapter 13: Lingering Obligations
Rock star can’t use bankruptcy to dump 
record company
Rock star Demonic Dan signed with Moon
Records, even though he was under an exclu-
sive contract with Star Recordings. When Star
asked a court to enter an injunction forbidding
Dan from performing for Moon, Dan filed bank-
ruptcy to discharge the recording contract with
Star.
The bankruptcy judge said, “No dice!”
The bankruptcy court ruled that Dan’s obligation
to Star under the exclusive recording contract
wasn’t a debt subject to discharge in bank-
ruptcy. So, despite his bankruptcy, Dan must still
honor his commitment and can only perform for
Star Records.

Postpetition charges on prepetition contracts
Charges arising after bankruptcy (postpetition charges) under a contract that
you made prior to bankruptcy (a prepetition contract) are usually wiped out.
For example, if you surrender your car to the finance company before bank-
ruptcy and the lender sells it at auction after bankruptcy but doesn’t receive
the total amount owed, tough beans. The lender can’t come after you because
the debt was discharged as a prepetition debt because you borrowed the
money when you signed the loan papers. See Chapter 6 for an explanation of
how events occurring prior to a bankruptcy filing (prepetition) frequently
have different ramifications than those occurring after the filing. In Chapter 10,
we describe how and why most things you acquire after the day your bank-
ruptcy is filed aren’t affected by your bankruptcy.
However, courts disagree about when certain contractual debts arise.
Say, for example, that prior to bankruptcy, your dad let you use his credit
card because you promised to make the payments and indemnify (reimburse
him) if the credit-card company ever came after Pop. When you file bank-
ruptcy and stop making the payments to the credit-card company, your dad
has to step up and pay off the card. In this case, your promise to indemnify
kicks in after bankruptcy. Does that mean your promise to reimburse Dad is
nondischargeable? Most — but definitely not all — courts will let you off the
hook because the actual promise was made prior to bankruptcy.
Divorce awards
Sometimes divorces are pending when bankruptcy is filed. Divorce decrees
commonly require one spouse to pay certain bills and indemnify the other for
any losses. The final divorce decree, however, is often not entered until after
the bankruptcy petition date. This delay raises the question of whether the
obligations created by the divorce decree are pre- or postbankruptcy. See
Chapter 17 for more on that chicken-and-egger.
Condo charges
Folks who live in a condo or co-op are assessed fees to maintain common
areas. In most cases, these fees are secured by the property.
If you intend to keep your residence, simply continue to pay these fees, just
like property taxes or your mortgage. But if you intend to surrender your res-
idence, watch out for a trap. Remember that debts arising after the petition
date aren’t discharged? Well, condominium or co-operative fees assessed
against your property after the petition date and up the point you relinquish
any interest in the property are nondischargeable. So, if you intend to surren-
der a condo or co-op, you should do it as soon as possible after filing bank-
ruptcy; maybe even before filing, if you have somewhere else to live.
204
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Unlisted debts
Sometimes, folks forget to list all their debts on their bankruptcy papers.
In a Chapter 13, debts not listed on your bankruptcy papers aren’t dis-
charged unless you amend your filing to include the creditor within 90 days
of the 341 meeting. (For more about the 341 meeting, see Chapter 6.)
In a Chapter 7 asset case (where assets are sold and proceeds are paid to
your creditors), an unlisted debt isn’t discharged unless you can prove that
the creditor had notice or actually knew about your bankruptcy in time to file
a proof of claim — generally within 90 days of the 341 meeting.
Most courts say that debts not listed in no-asset cases (where no assets are
actually liquidated: This category accounts for 96 percent of all bankrupt-
cies) are discharged because the creditor wouldn’t receive any money even
when the debt was listed. Keep in mind, though, that this stipulation isn’t an
invitation for sloppiness.
When the time comes to clean up your credit reports after bankruptcy, you
can easily show credit bureaus that a particular debt was included in bank-
ruptcy by providing a copy of your bankruptcy schedules. In the case of
unlisted debts, you have to prove that in your jurisdiction, unlisted debts in
no-asset cases are eliminated and that yours was a no-asset case. Sometimes
you even have to hire a lawyer to make this point.
Another reason to be as careful as possible when listing all your debts is to
obtain the benefit of the 60-day bar date. See the “Sweating Out the 60-Day Bar
Date” section, later in this chapter.
Debts preserved under sections 
of the Bankruptcy Code
The Bankruptcy Code specifies that certain types of debts are nondischarge-
able. There are two kinds of nondischargeable debts: priority debts and non-
priority nondischargeable debts.
Priority debts
The most common are priority support obligations, some taxes, and claims
for personal injuries caused by drunk driving or boating. Your Chapter 13
plan can and must propose to pay these types of debts in full.
205
Chapter 13: Lingering Obligations

This requirement may work to your advantage because your Chapter 13 plan
can devote a large portion of the payments to paying off debts that would
otherwise haunt you after bankruptcy, while paying much less to debts that
bankruptcy will eliminate.
If a nondischargeable debt doesn’t have priority status, a Chapter 13 plan
cannot pay more on it than on ordinary dischargeable debts, so most of the
money you pay into the plan goes to pay off debts that would be wiped out. For
example, student loans are nondischargeable, but they’re not priority debts. A
Chapter 13 plan may not pay more to student loan creditors than to holders of
dischargeable claims, such as credit-card companies (see Chapter 18). So, if
your plan payment is $300, only a small portion goes toward paying off the
student loan, which remains after your other debts are discharged.
In contrast, support obligations are priority nondischargeable debts, and it’s
okay for the plan to pay these claims more than others.
To recap, if your plan payment is $300, you can devote almost all the money
to extinguishing your support obligations while paying virtually nothing on
your credit-card debts. The downside of priority status is that because you
must pay these claims in full over the life of any Chapter 13 plan, you may be
effectively ineligible for Chapter 13 if your priority debts are more than you
can pay over a five-year plan. By the same token, large priority debts may
give you a better chance of passing the Means Test (see Chapter 5).
Nonpriority nondischargeable debts
Most nondischargeable debts are nonpriority debts. These debts can’t be
given preferential treatment in Chapter 13 and won’t help you pass the Means
Test (see Chapter 5).
This chapter discusses most of the nonpriority nondischargeable debts.
However, we devote separate chapters to credit-card debt (Chapter 14);
taxes( Chapter 15); intentional misdeeds (Chapter 16); divorce obligations
(Chapter 17) and student loans (Chapter 18).
Nondischargeable Debts in Chapter 7
versus Chapter 13
Some debts that aren’t dischargeable in Chapter 7 can still be discharged if
you complete a Chapter 13 and get a super discharge. Table 13-1 lists which
debts are nondischargeable in Chapter 7 and which are nondischargeable in
Chapter 13.

Sweating Out the 60-Day Bar Date
Some debts listed in Table 13-1 are actually only potentially nondischargeable.
A creditor with one of these types of debts must file an adversary proceeding —
a minilawsuit filed in the bankruptcy court — within 60 days of your 341
meeting with creditors. (Don’t confuse an adversary proceeding with filing a
proof of claim, which requests funds from the bankruptcy estate.) An adver-
sary proceeding to except a debt from discharge seeks to keep the debtor on
the hook for the debt despite bankruptcy.
If a creditor wants to use any of the grounds in the following list to try to keep
its debt from being discharged, that creditor must meet the 60-day deadline:
 Fraud
 Embezzlement or theft
 Willful and malicious conduct
When the creditor misses this deadline, you’re off the hook, provided that
the creditor
 Was properly listed on your bankruptcy papers, or
 Knew of your bankruptcy in time to file an adversary proceeding
Avoiding the Urge to Borrow to Pay
Nondischargeable Debts
Most loans are dischargeable. So, some people are tempted to take out a
bank loan or a cash advance on a credit card to pay a would-be nondischarge-
able debt, with the aim of discharging the new loan in bankruptcy and essen-
tially trying to replace nondischargeable debt with dischargeable debt.
Bad idea.
209
Chapter 13: Lingering Obligations

If the lender can prove that was your plan all along, the new loan wouldn’t be
discharged in either a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 — because of fraud — and
may be grounds for dismissing any Chapter 13 filing on bad faith grounds.
Funds borrowed to pay nondischargeable taxes aren’t dischargeable in a
Chapter 7, even though you weren’t planning to file bankruptcy when you
took out the loan. But the loan would be dischargeable in Chapter 13 unless
you borrowed the money without intending to pay. And remember that if the
nondischargeable debt is a priority debt, leaving it unpaid as of the petition
date can make it easier to pass the Means Test.
See Chapter 15 to find out which taxes are nondischargeable.
Remember that the trustee can also recover some kinds of payments made
before bankruptcy and distribute the funds among all your creditors (see
Chapter 19). So, not only do you risk the lender’s wrath, but also the nondis-
chargeable debt you intended to pay is revived — a double whammy!
Understanding Reaffirmation Agreements
Any debt that is reaffirmed is not eliminated.
Reaffirmation is a process by which you agree to pay all or part of a debt that
otherwise is wiped out in bankruptcy. It’s as if you never filed bankruptcy on
that particular debt; the creditor has all the remedies available before bank-
ruptcy. He can sue you, repossess collateral . . . whatever.
In the old days, creditors used a number of ploys to trick people into reaffirm-
ing their debts. Sometimes, if a debtor merely acknowledged the existence of
the discharged debt, it automatically was revived. The 1978 Bankruptcy Code
sought to put an end to those shenanigans by requiring that reaffirmation
agreements be in writing, filed with the court, and subject to cancellation by
the debtors for 60 days. In addition, the bankruptcy court must conclude,
based on information from the debtor or the debtor’s attorney, that reaffirma-
tion doesn’t impose an undue hardship and is in the debtor’s best interest.
Reasons to reaffirm
Why on earth would someone file Chapter 7 to wipe out her debts and then
turn around and reaffirm? Isn’t that the ultimate hair-of-the-dog? Good point.
But people do reaffirm, and sometimes for good reasons. The reasons folks
typically reaffirm are so that they can
210
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

 Keep collateral that secures the debt. See Chapter 11.
 Maintain credit privileges. Creditors often offer to extend new credit
when you agree to reaffirm a portion of an existing account. Accepting
such credit rarely is a good idea. By recognizing that the amount you
reaffirm is essentially a finance charge for the new loan, you can see how
ridiculously expensive the new credit is. Besides, you probably won’t
have that much trouble getting new credit anyway.
 Compromise a debt to a creditor claiming to have grounds for declar-
ing the debt nondischargeable. Often, a creditor will go away if you
reaffirm just a portion of the disputed debt rather than the whole thing.
Reaffirming to settle a potentially nondischargeable debt makes sense
only if a creditor has a good case. Your lawyer will know when the credi-
tor is bluffing.
Changing your mind
Even when you sign a reaffirmation agreement, you still can change your mind
if you write to the creditor before your discharge is entered or within 60 days
after the agreement is filed with the bankruptcy court, whichever is later.
Some creditors don’t bother filing reaffirmation agreements with the court, so
be sure to find out whether a reaffirmation agreement was filed whenever a
creditor tries to sue you on a reaffirmation agreement after bankruptcy. If the
agreement was never filed with the bankruptcy court, you still can cancel it.
Having Your Discharge 
Denied or Revoked
The bankruptcy court has the power in a Chapter 7 case to deny your dis-
charge altogether so that none of your debts are erased. That’s obviously a
stinker. You already surrendered any nonexempt property, your credit record
is besmirched with a bankruptcy, and you still owe all your debts. And, to
make matters worse, you can never file Chapter 7 on these debts. Now why
would a judge do such a nasty thing?
Prior to BARF, as we and other objective observers refer to the bankruptcy
reform bill enacted in 2005, discharge denial was reserved for serious, inten-
tional misdeeds. But now, some minor slip-ups can result in your debts not
being wiped out.
211
Chapter 13: Lingering Obligations

Under BARF, all debtors are required to complete a course in financial man-
agement as a condition of receiving a discharge unless no courses are avail-
able in your area. These courses must be approved by the United States
Trustee. For many folks, this requirement may seem like a demeaning and
unnecessary exercise, and in many cases, it is. Just the same, if approved
courses are available in your area, you must complete the program.
Otherwise, your bankruptcy was for naught.
Also, under BARF, a party in interest may insist that any federal income tax
returns that you file with taxing authorities while your bankruptcy is open
also be filed with the court. If you don’t, you won’t receive a discharge.
Finally, after you’ve made all the payments under Chapter 13, any prepetition
support obligation must be paid in full and all support obligations arising
after the petition date must be current. If not, no discharge — even though
you may have made every payment under your plan.
Instead of providing creditors with copies of your actual tax returns, you can
send them summaries (transcripts) of the returns. Generally, transcripts con-
tain less personal information than actual tax returns. The IRS usually mails
you copies of transcripts if you call the IRS-centralized Priority Hotline at
800-860-4259.
Grounds for denial of a Chapter 7 
discharge
A Chapter 7 discharge can be denied if you
 Received a Chapter 7 discharge in a case filed within eight years of your
present filing, or in a Chapter 13 case filed within six years of your pre-
sent filing (unless creditors were paid at least 70 percent of their claims
in the earlier Chapter 13)
 Consciously fail to list an asset on your bankruptcy schedules
 Intentionally give false information in your schedules
 Lie to the trustee at the 341 meeting
 Refuse to cooperate with the trustee
 Disobey an order of the bankruptcy court

 Don’t file all the federal tax returns that should be filed with the court.
See Chapter 6.
 Act too aggressively in converting nonexempt assets into exempt assets
(see Chapter 10).
Grounds for denial of a Chapter 13 
discharge
A Chapter 13 discharge can be denied if you
 Received a discharge in a prior case filed under Chapter 7, 11, or 12
within four years of your present filing or in a previous Chapter 13 filed
within two years
 Have not kept up with your postpetition support payments
 Don’t file all the tax returns that should be filed with the court (see
Chapter 6).
 Failed to complete a course in financial management while your bank-
ruptcy was pending
Protecting your discharge
The best way to ensure that you receive a discharge is to be completely
truthful and make a full disclosure to your lawyer before you file.
If you put property in someone else’s name, money into someone else’s bank
account, or otherwise try to protect any assets from creditors, be sure to tell
your lawyer. These errors usually can be repaired when action is taken before
you file bankruptcy. Afterward, it may be too late. So, remaining silent and
hoping that no one finds out about these kinds of transfers is very dangerous.
Don’t risk it.
Your lawyer needs to give you copies of all the schedules filed with the bank-
ruptcy court. Review them to make sure that all your assets are listed.
Innocent mistakes can easily be fixed if you act promptly, especially when
you correct your bankruptcy papers before the 341 meeting with creditors. If
someone else points out the error, you may have trouble claiming that the
mistake was an innocent one.

Chapter 13: Lingering Obligations

Revoking your discharge
Although extremely rare, a Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 discharge may be
revoked whenever it’s obtained by fraud, and the party asking for the revoca-
tion did not know about the fraud prior to discharge. Note: We’re referring to
fraud in the bankruptcy case, not fraud in incurring the debt in the first place.
A Chapter 7 discharge may also be revoked if you
 Fail to report or surrender property of the estate
 Intentionally refused to obey an order of the court
Under BARF, a Chapter 7 discharge may be revoked if the U.S. Trustee
chooses your case for a random audit and you
 Don’t satisfactorily explain any mistakes in your bankruptcy paperwork
 Don’t cooperate with the audit

A
lmost every consumer who faces bankruptcy has some credit-card
debts, and most are up to their gills in it. You’d think that credit-card
companies, instead of perpetually whining about the relatively meager losses
that are attributable to bankruptcy, would instead dispense credit more
responsibly.
And you’d be wrong.
Although bankruptcies force some lenders to be a little more careful, most
continue dispensing credit with reckless abandon. Because credit-card debt
is such a pervasive element in bankruptcy, understanding the fact, fiction,
nuances, and implications surrounding it is important. In this chapter, we
reveal how creditors play the game, how they sometimes try to pin you for
fraud, and how you can avoid getting stuck with the Old Maid card.
Playing the Credit-Card Game
Credit-card lending is the most profitable segment of banking — which is no
surprise, given the heads-we-win/tails-you-lose way lenders play the game.

All too often, people accept unsolicited, preapproved credit-card offers that,
simply put, make getting into credit trouble all too easy. Borrowers max out
their credit cards but find themselves making only the minimum monthly
payments at interest rates of around 15 percent (and often higher). Fifteen
percent is the average. With this kind of dutiful payment practice in place,
credit-card companies happily skim off profits of double, triple, or even
quadruple the prime-lending rate. Oh, happy days!
And these unsolicited, preapproved credit-card offers never seem to stop
coming (even when your credit report tanks), tempting people to apply for
another credit card that promises an additional credit limit and increased bor-
rowing power with which they can cover the monthly minimum payments on
their first credit card. Ah, yes, this vicious circle truly is how the credit-card
game works. And, you know what? Consumers rarely win.
Whenever you find yourself on the losing side of the credit-card game, con-
sult a bankruptcy lawyer to explore your options and develop a comprehen-
sive plan for handling the problem before it gets worse.
Don’t give in to the temptation of paying off your debts by using the equity in
your home. Sure, the interest rate on a home-equity loan may be lower and
the interest you pay may be tax-deductible, but when you’re struggling to
make only minimum payments on credit cards, you’ll probably have the same
kind of trouble making payments on a home-equity loan and face losing your
most important asset in the process. Before taking a home-equity loan, your
homestead may well be off-limits to credit-card lenders, even if you don’t file
bankruptcy. When you take out a home-equity loan, you put your house on
the line for debts that probably can be eliminated in bankruptcy, or maybe
just ignored.
216
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 
Credit companies: Their home is your hassle
Did you ever wonder why most credit-card
companies claim Delaware or South Dakota as
their home state? No? Well, maybe you should.
It’s pretty clever.
In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court opened the
floodgates for consumer lending with its deci-
sion in what’s known as the Marquette Case.
The Court ruled that national banks can export
the interest rate of the state in which the bank 
is located to its out-of-state customers and
credit-card holders without running afoul of the
usury laws of the customers’ home states. This
decision, in effect, deregulated control of inter-
est rates by individual states and emasculated
state usury laws.
Delaware and South Dakota figured they could
attract big lenders by eliminating interest rate
restrictions in the wake of Marquette.
They were right.

Similarly, think long and hard before dipping into your IRA or 401(k) to pay
off credit cards. You’ll get socked with hefty tax penalties and may not even
be able to solve all your credit-card woes. You get to keep most types of
retirement plans in bankruptcy (see Chapter 10), so check with a bankruptcy
lawyer before raiding your retirement plans.
Watch out for debt-consolidation outfits that may try to convince you to
make futile attempts at repaying your debts without clearly informing you
that your creditors are paying them a percentage of the money they collect
from you. Some borrowers succeed in paying their debts through consolida-
tion, but many people make payments for years only to eventually end up in
bankruptcy.
Seeing What Judges See
Bankruptcy judges are growing increasingly unsympathetic with credit-card
predators who have the gall to come into their courts and claim that they
were the ones defrauded. Although your odds of finding a sympathetic judge
seem to be increasing, the rule of law reigns, and few judges will violate their
legal and ethical obligations to apply that rule just because they don’t like the
way a credit-card company operates. That said, what you need is an under-
standing of the legal framework so that you can judge for yourself whether a
credit-card company has a legitimate complaint against you. Creditors argue
that when someone uses a credit card, he implies that he has the ability and
intent to pay. If it turns out that the customer couldn’t afford to pay the
charges, he’s guilty of fraud . . . or so goes the theory of creditors.
Some courts buy this argument, but most find it simplistic and, absent addi-
tional circumstances, not terribly persuasive, for reasons that are all but self-
evident: Although a customer’s use of a credit card may imply that he intends
to pay, it should not imply that he has the present ability to pay. After all,
many folks use credit cards precisely because they’re short of cash —which
is precisely what credit-card companies encourage in their endless solicita-
tions. Remember, debts from fraud are nondischargeable in either Chapter 7
or Chapter 13.
Until recently, debtors could avoid the so-called credit-card fraud issue alto-
gether by filing under Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7. Even credit-card
abusers were given absolution if they were at least willing to pay as much as
they could afford over three years.
Not surprisingly, BARF, the alleged “reform” law largely written by the credit-
card industry, changes all that. Now there’s no escape for credit-card fraud,
even if you file Chapter 13. The problem is, fraud very much is in eye of the
beholder, and you may find yourself so-labeled even though you did not
intend to cheat and merely acted foolishly.
217
Chapter 14: A House of Cards: Wiping Out Credit-Card Debts

Examining Your Mind Set When 
You Incurred the Debt
Figuring out whether you acted fraudulently, or just foolishly, takes some-
thing of a mind-reading act for the court to accomplish. The court isn’t really
looking for an excuse to slam you, but if you give the judge a reason, there’s a
good chance you’ll get whacked with a fraud judgment. In addition to the
obvious subjective element, a number of objective questions come into play.
You may want to ask yourself:
 Did I make a bunch of charges right before bankruptcy? It’s obvious
that the closer to bankruptcy that the charges occur, the more likely
that a judge may think that you never intended to pay.
A number of small charges within a very short time when an account is
in default or over the limit may suggest that the customer purposely
kept charges below levels where a merchant is likely to check the card
(knowing that the lender would never authorize them). Particularly
damning are multiple small charges on the same day. Changes in your
charging habits may also indicate an intention not to pay. If, for example,
you typically charged about $150 per month, and then a few months
before bankruptcy you started charging like crazy, a court may be
inclined to think that you bought things on credit while planning to file
bankruptcy.
 Did I make charges after talking to a bankruptcy lawyer? Whenever
you charge purchases after talking to a bankruptcy attorney, appear-
ances point to your already having decided to file bankruptcy when you
bought the stuff on credit. However, courts realize that many people
visit a bankruptcy attorney just to find out their options, and many
never end up filing or, at best, wait as long as possible before doing so.
So, the mere fact that you charge some purchases after talking to a bank-
ruptcy attorney is not conclusive evidence of a fraudulent mental state.
 What was my financial condition when I made the charges? The fact
that a person is in dire financial straits when incurring debt is relevant
as to whether he intended to pay but, again, it isn’t definitive. If you hon-
estly believed that things would turn around, that a new job would come
through, that you’d be able to refinance your home, that your business
would take off, and yes, even that your luck would turn around at the
gambling casino, you’re probably not in trouble.
In the eyes of most judges, the key determination isn’t whether you real-
istically expected to come up with the cash, but whether you honestly
(even if foolishly) believed your ship would come in.
 Did I buy luxury items? The concept here is that someone buying neces-
sities is more likely to repay the debt than someone who purchases
luxury items. But a luxury for one person is a necessity for another.
218
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Forcing the Credit-Card Company 
to Prove Its Case
Courts don’t merely consider whether a debtor was at fault in making exces-
sive credit-card charges: They also consider the degree to which creditors
irresponsibly push credit cards on folks who can’t afford to pay. In keeping
you from wiping out the debt, the creditor must prove that it had no reason
to know that you were drowning in debt at the time it authorized the charges.
Several courts have ruled that creditors who issue cards to people whose
lack of creditworthiness would have been revealed by an ordinary credit
report can’t claim that the cards they issue were used fraudulently. These
judges say that if the credit-card company had exercised just a little pru-
dence, it would have known that the last thing that person needed was yet
another credit card.
The same is true for many creditors that rely on statistical credit scores like
the ones prepared by the three national credit bureaus — Equifax, Trans
Union, and Experian. Each company has a protocol for its scoring system, but
all are based on a computer credit model called the Fair, Isaac credit bureau
score, sometimes called FICO. Like it or not, anyone who uses credit cards
has a FICO score.
Courts have observed that FICO scores reveal little more than whether a
prospective borrower has made timely minimum payments on his account
and have disputed whether a creditor is justified in basing its decision to
extend credit solely on those scores. These courts are less than understand-
ing in cases where credit-card companies conduct no meaningful investiga-
tion into creditworthiness before issuing cards. Only when the debtor files
bankruptcy does the creditor come up with so many reasons why it wouldn’t
have extended credit if had it only been aware of the debtor’s financial 
condition — and argues, therefore, that the court should not allow the debtor
to wipe out this particular debt.
Explaining Presumptively 
Fraudulent Charges
Luxury purchases totaling more than $500 to a single creditor within 90 days
of bankruptcy or cash advances totaling more than $750 to a single creditor
within 70 days of bankruptcy are presumptively fraudulent. Presumptively
fraudulent means that instead of the usual situation where a creditor must
prove fraudulent intent, the debtor has the burden of convincing the court
that he intended to pay for these charges.
219
Chapter 14: A House of Cards: Wiping Out Credit-Card Debts

However, different judges may understandably have different ideas on what
constitutes a “luxury.” But you can still rebut the presumption of fraud by
showing that you really did intend to pay the charges when you made them.
A prudent bankruptcy attorney attempts to sidestep any problems with pre-
sumptively fraudulent charges by simply waiting at least 90 days from the
last significant credit purchase before filing the bankruptcy. But there may be
reasons why other considerations require an immediate filing. For example, if
a foreclosure sale is imminent, you probably can’t afford to wait, and your
recent purchases may be called into question.
Defending Against False Financial
Statement Allegations
Occasionally, a creditor, seeking to prevent its account from being wiped out
by bankruptcy, claims fraud on the grounds that the customer obtained
credit privileges through the use of a false financial statement.
Most modern credit-card applications ask for little more than a name, address,
Social Security number, and income. As credit companies request less and less
information on their loan applications, claiming that you committed fraud by
not revealing what wasn’t asked becomes more and more difficult for them.
The creditor doesn’t necessarily win just because your income was not as
high as you indicated on the credit-card application. The creditor must also
establish that you knew that your statement was false, that you intended to
deceive the company, and that it would not have approved credit privileges if
it otherwise had known about your actual income. This gambit is next to
impossible to prove, especially when a creditor made its decision based on
credit scores and not on the credit application.
Using Credit-Card Advances 
for Gambling
Many people who get into credit-card trouble are gamblers and, for many
problem gamblers, the credit-card industry behaves like an all-too-eager-to-
please bartender in a room full of binge drinkers. Some creditors even put
ATM machines in gambling casinos, thereby encouraging customers to gamble
220
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

with cash advances. Then, when a customer ends up in bankruptcy, these
same companies try to keep the advances from being wiped out by alleging
that the debtor was guilty of fraud for using cash advances for gambling — the
very thing that the company encouraged them to do in the first place.
If your only hope of paying your debts was to hit the jackpot, you may be
looking at an allegation of credit-card abuse. However, the criteria employed
by most judges is not an objective analysis of whether your dream of hitting
the big one made sense, but rather is a subjective analysis of whether that
scenario made sense to you. Your case would be even stronger if, in the past,
you used winnings to pay debts.
Bottom line: Even if you used credit cards for gambling, most courts would
still allow you to wipe out the charges provided that you honestly believed
that you would win enough to repay the charges.
Bullying the Credit-Card Bullies
Creditors are well aware that many debtors are essentially broke and that the
last thing they want to do, or are able to do, is pay extra for their bankruptcy
attorney to defend them against an allegation of fraud. Sometimes creditors
claim fraud in a bankruptcy case regardless of whether the claim has merit,
hoping that the debtor settles by agreeing to repay part of the debt.
The Bankruptcy Code, however, provides you with a measure of protection
against this sort of arm-twisting. If you put up a fight and win, the creditor
can be ordered to pay your attorney fees and, in extreme cases, be fined.
221
Chapter 14: A House of Cards: Wiping Out Credit-Card Debts
Credit-card company pays the price for bullying
As her credit report duly noted, Claire was
buried in debt when a credit-marketing com-
pany sent her a preapproved line of credit. Not
surprisingly, Claire used the new line of credit in
a desperate and misguided attempt to pay off
her older bills. When she ended up filing bank-
ruptcy, the credit-card company that extended
the credit line tried to prevent the debt that was
owed from being wiped out by alleging that
Claire fraudulently accepted and used the loan
knowing full well she could not pay. Because
Claire certainly couldn’t afford to pay any more
money to her bankruptcy attorney to defend
against the fraud, she figured that she’d just
have to settle.
Not so fast!
Claire’s attorney promptly directed the court’s
attention to the fact that the credit-card com-
pany initiated a frivolous fraud claim in an
attempt to extort a settlement from his client.
The court not only dismissed the fraud allega-
tion, but it also ordered the credit-card com-
pany to pay Claire’s legal bills.

Transferring Credit-Card Balances
Just about everyone with a mailbox is constantly bombarded with pleas from
credit-card lenders to use their low-interest cards to pay off balances on com-
petitors’ cards. Odd that these solicitations avoid using words like “borrow”
or “loan,” isn’t it? Instead, they euphemistically label these transactions “bal-
ance transfers.” Predictably, many people fail to fully realize that the “trans-
fer” actually is a new loan — but that’s exactly what it is.
If you’re excruciatingly careful and diligent and able to essentially juggle your
books without dropping any balls (and if you were that good at financial gym-
nastics, you probably wouldn’t be reading this book), it is possible to play
the transfer game to your advantage. For example, you can pay off one loan
with another loan that carries a lower “teaser” interest rate and save money
as long as you pay off the second loan before the interest rate jumps, which it
will. In our experience, however, most people who play this game lose, and
the people who promote these transfer gimmicks obviously know the odds
are against you. In fact, they literally bank on it.
Recognize balance transfers for what they are and fully explain to your attor-
ney any transfers you’ve made so that he can decide whether delaying your
bankruptcy for a few months would be better.
There are two reasons to delay bankruptcy:
 Because a balance transfer is a loan, if you file within 90 days of the
transfer, the debt might be presumed to have been fraudulent. See the
section “Explaining Presumptively Fraudulent Charges,” earlier in this
chapter.
 Because a balance transfer is also a payment on an existing debt, if you
file bankruptcy within 90 days of the transfer, the trustee could recover
the money and thereby complicate your bankruptcy (see Chapter 19).

Bankruptcy to Deal with Tax Debts
In This Chapter
 Wiping out federal and state income taxes in bankruptcy
 Dealing with other kinds of taxes
 Considering a loan to pay your taxes
S
ometimes you can get rid of your tax obligations through bankruptcy, but
doing so isn’t an easy task. Taxes generally can’t be discharged in a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy and must be paid in full over the life of a Chapter 13
repayment plan. Nevertheless, under a complicated set of rules and court deci-
sions, you may be able to escape paying taxes, if enough time passes between
the time you incurred the tax liability and the time that you file bankruptcy.
In this chapter, we explain the circumstances under which you can wipe out
your federal and state income taxes and certain other kinds of taxes. In Table
15-1, we provide a detailed reference to how bankruptcy deals with federal
income taxes. We also look briefly at the tactic of borrowing to pay your
taxes. See Chapter 9 for nonbankruptcy solutions to your tax problems.
Getting a Handle on What Happens 
to Taxes in Bankruptcy
Figuring out what will happen to your tax obligations in bankruptcy can be a
real bugger. Debts can fall into three categories:
 Dischargeable debts that get wiped out.
 Nondischargeable priority debts that don’t get wiped out and must be
paid in full under the terms of any Chapter 13 plan. The upshot to prior-
ity debts is that having them will make it easier to pass the Means Test.
Also, in Chapter 13, you can pay priority debts while paying little or
nothing on other types of debts that will be wiped out even if not paid.

 Nondischargeable nonpriority debts that don’t get wiped out, can’t be
paid ahead of other debts in Chapter 13, and don’t help you pass the
Means Test. The upside is that you’re not required to pay them in full
under a Chapter 13 plan.
Tax obligations can fall into any one of these categories.
Wiping Out Dischargeable Income Taxes
As a general proposition, if you filed a timely, nonfraudulent income tax
return and haven’t engaged in tax evasion other than simply failing to pay the
tax, your debt to Uncle Sam is dischargeable in a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13 —
assuming, that is, that the taxes are more than three years old and were
assessed more than 240 days before bankruptcy. Simple, right? Of course not.
Nothing is simple when dealing with that veritable monument to Murphy’s
Law — the good ‘ol tax statutes.
For example, if a tax return for 2000 was due April 15, 2001, you may reason-
ably think that if you filed bankruptcy after April 15, 2004, the taxes would
vanish, right? But reasonable thinking doesn’t necessarily apply. After all,
you’re dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. If you received an extension
of time to file your return, the three-year period starts on the date that the
extension (or extensions) expires. It doesn’t start on the date the return origi-
nally was due.
Besides extensions, certain events can also interrupt the three-year period,
giving the IRS even more time to collect your taxes. For example,
 If you filed a bankruptcy case prior to your current bankruptcy, the time
that the earlier case was open isn’t counted, and 90 days are added to
the three years.
 Any time that the IRS was prevented from collecting taxes because of a
request for a due process hearing (see Chapter 9 for more on due process
hearings) does not count, and an additional 90 days is tacked on.
 Any amount of time during which a taxpayer assistance order (where a
taxpayer advocate tells the IRS to lay off you for a while) is in effect
doesn’t count toward the three years. See Chapter 9 for more informa-
tion on the taxpayer advocate and taxpayer assistance orders.
Bottom line: If you neglected to file a return, filed it late, submitted a fraudu-
lent return, or otherwise evaded taxes, you’ve really confuzzled things. But,
depending on what you did and why you did it (not paying because you were
broke is less of a problem than flat-out lying), bankruptcy may be able to help.
224
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Paying Nondischargeable 
Priority Income Taxes
Nondischargeable priority taxes are income taxes less than three years old (as
calculated in the preceding section) and also taxes assessed within 240 days
of bankruptcy.
Although these taxes have to be paid in full under any Chapter 13 plan, prior-
ity taxes have several advantages over other nondischargeable debts that do
not enjoy priority status:
 They can help you pass the Means Test (see Chapter 5).
 In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you pay these taxes in full (so that they don’t
haunt you after completion of the plan), while paying little or nothing on
dischargeable claims such as credit-card debts.
 Postpetition interest does not accrue on these claims. (unless a notice of
tax lien has been recorded).
 If the IRS doesn’t file a proof of claim in time (180 days after the petition
date), these taxes get wiped out even if they’re not paid.
Coping with Nondischargeable
Nonpriority Income Taxes
Nondischargeable nonpriority taxes are those due more than three years ago
and assessed more than 240 day before bankruptcy where you
 Never filed a return (although the IRS can, and often will, file a dummy
return, which is a return filed by the feds in your name so that the gov-
ernment can assess a tax. This type of return doesn’t count unless the
return was filed with your cooperation and assistance).
 Filed a late return less than two years before bankruptcy. Example: Your
2000 income tax return was due on April 15, 2001. But you didn’t actually
file the return until July 21, 2003, so the taxes would not be discharge-
able in a bankruptcy before July 21, 2005. A growing number of courts
say that a return filed by a taxpayer after the IRS has already prepared a
dummy return doesn’t count. So taxes for this year would be nondis-
chargeable nonpriority taxes even though a debtor filed a return more
than two years before bankruptcy.
 Filed a fraudulent return or intentionally tried to evade taxes.
225
Chapter 15: Give unto Caesar: Using Bankruptcy to Deal with Tax Debts

These taxes are more troublesome than priority taxes because
 They don’t help you get past the Means Test.
 Interest on these taxes continues to accrue.
 You can’t give them preferential treatment in Chapter 13.
Confronting Unfiled Tax Returns
If you want to file Chapter 13, prior to the 341 meeting, you have to file with
the appropriate taxing authorities all federal, state, and local tax returns for
the past four years. If you don’t, your case may be dismissed. However, you
may get an extension of up to 120 days to file these returns.
Although you should have all your returns prepared prior to filing bank-
ruptcy, you should consult with a bankruptcy lawyer before actually filing the
returns with taxing authorities. Remember that taxes assessed within 240
days of bankruptcy are priority taxes. It may be to your benefit to file tax
returns and have the tax assessed within this 240-day period. On the other
hand, bestowing priority status on nondischargeable taxes may render you
ineligible for Chapter 13 if the tax liability is more than you can pay under
your Chapter 13 plan during the maximum five year life of the plan.
If any interested party so requests, you also have to file with the bankruptcy
court copies of any federal returns that are filed with the IRS while your bank-
ruptcy is open.

Claiming too many dependents was tax evasion
Joe told his employer he had eight dependents,
but he really had only one. As a result, Joe took
home more money from each paycheck. When
tax time rolled around, Joe discovered that he
couldn’t pay his whopping tax obligation
because he’d already spent all his extra take-
home pay. And yet Joe still properly filed his
income tax return; however, he didn’t pay the
taxes.
Four years later, when Joe filed Chapter 7 bank-
ruptcy, the court refused to wipe out his taxes,
saying that Joe was guilty of tax evasion for
claiming too many dependents and spending
the money on other things.

about four months).
Coping with Interest and Penalties
The government charges interest and imposes heavy penalties when you
don’t pay your taxes on time. Sometimes, interest and penalties add up to
more than the tax itself.
Interest is treated differently than penalties in bankruptcy. In addition, differ-
ent rules exist for interest and penalties accruing before you file for bank-
ruptcy (“prepetition”) and those arising after you file (“postpetition”).
Prepetition interest charged on unpaid taxes is, for the most part, treated the
same as taxes in both a Chapter 7 and a 13. When the tax is nondischarge-
able, so is the interest. Penalties, on the other hand, are discharged in a
Chapter 7 if they are more than three years old. In a Chapter 13, however,
prepetition penalties are dischargeable regardless of when they arose.
Postpetition interest on nondischargeable taxes continues accruing during
and after a Chapter 7 case. Interest stops accruing in a Chapter 13 case when
it’s filed. And yet, whenever a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is dismissed or con-
verted to a Chapter 7, interest is added as if no Chapter 13 had been filed.
230
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Here’s a wrinkle: If you filed a joint return for taxes included in your Chapter
13 case, but your spouse didn’t join you in filing Chapter 13, the IRS still can
come after her for interest that accrues while your Chapter 13 case is open.
Penalties on nondischargeable taxes aren’t assessed while a Chapter 7 or a
Chapter 13 case is open. Keep in mind that a Chapter 7 case is usually not
open very long — typically just a few months — unlike a Chapter 13, which
ordinarily lasts for at least three years.
Managing Federal Tax Liens
If you owe taxes, the IRS can record a Notice of Tax Lien in the pubic records.
Doing so gives it a lien (see Chapter 11 for the lowdown on liens) on all your
earthly belongings. Although the IRS periodically issues guidelines as to
when a Notice of Tax Lien should be filed, the decision rests largely with the
tax collector handling your case.
If a Notice of Tax Lien has been lodged before you file bankruptcy, the rules in
the previous section don’t apply and discharging taxes becomes even more
difficult.
Taxes due, together with associated interest and penalties, are secured by all
your prepetition assets (including your retirement plan, which is usually pro-
tected from most other creditors). Even when these obligations are dis-
chargeable, they still encumber prepetition assets. If you suspect that a tax
lien is about to be filed, contact a bankruptcy specialist immediately.
Making the Trustee Pay Your Taxes
If you think that you’ll owe federal income taxes for the current year, and you
have assets that will be liquidated in your bankruptcy, you may be able to get
the trustee to pay the taxes.
The Tax Code enables Chapter 7 debtors to divide the year in which they file
bankruptcy into two short years. For example: If you filed Chapter 7 bank-
ruptcy September 2, 2005, you can elect to divide the tax year 2005 into two
parts — the first running from January 1, 2005, to September 2, 2005, and the
second running from September 3, 2005, to December 31, 2005. Consequently,
liabilities that accrued up to September 2, 2005, are considered prepetition
priority claims, which the trustee must pay ahead of other creditors.
231
Chapter 15: Give unto Caesar: Using Bankruptcy to Deal with Tax Debts

This short-year election must be made shortly after filing bankruptcy. So, dis-
cuss this with your lawyer before you ever file. In addition to making the elec-
tion, you or your lawyer need to make sure that a timely proof of claim is filed
by or on behalf of the IRS. See Chapter 6 to find out more about the claims
process.
Keeping on Top of Postpetition Taxes 
in Chapter 13
If you’re paying off taxes under Chapter 13, be aware that income taxes aris-
ing after bankruptcy aren’t discharged, so you should plan on keeping up
with future tax obligations. If you can’t pay postpetition taxes immediately,
you can submit a payment proposal to the IRS when you file your return. If
you propose to pay the postpetition tax within three years, the IRS will proba-
bly go along. See Chapter 9 for more on submitting payment plans to the IRS.
In a Chapter 13, if you don’t keep up with postpetition taxes, your bankruptcy
plan may fall apart. See Chapter 20 to see why it’s so important to stay on top
of postpetition taxes in a Chapter 13.
Paying Taxes Before Bankruptcy
If you owe nondischargeable taxes, consider selling nonexempt property and
paying off the tax debt before filing bankruptcy. If part of your tax obligation
is dischargeable, you can force the IRS to apply the payments to the nondis-
chargeable part. However, you lose this option after you file bankruptcy. (See
Chapter 9 for more about the benefits of allocating tax payments.) But, as we
explain in Chapter 19, paying large debts shortly before bankruptcy some-
times can backfire, so don’t pay any taxes without first consulting with your
lawyer. Also, you may have a better chance of passing the Means Test if prior-
ity taxes remain unpaid at the time of bankruptcy (see Chapter 5).
Using the Statute of Limitations 
to Escape Taxes
Time heals many wounds, including some tax debts. Generally, if more than
ten years go by after income taxes are assessed (which is usually shortly after
you filed your return), the taxes vanish even if you don’t file bankruptcy. But
certain factors suspend or extend the statute of limitations (see Chapter 8).
232
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Facing the Consequences if 
You’re a “Tax Protestor”
The courts are fed up with tax protestors. If you have a history of opposing
income taxes on constitutional, religious, or philosophical grounds, don’t
expect much sympathy. The IRS considers you a CPA — Certified Pain in 
the . . . — and it’s going to strenuously object to the discharging of old taxes
in a Chapter 7, arguing that you’re guilty of intentional tax evasion. If you file
a Chapter 13, it may try to get your case dismissed on bad faith grounds. A tax
protestor who wants to discharge her taxes in bankruptcy has to prove that
she has seen the light, and her protesting days are over.
Dealing with the State Tax Man
For the most part, the same rules that apply to federal taxes also cover state
income taxes — with one peculiar glitch. Most, if not all, states require you to
file an amended state tax return whenever your federal tax liability for a given
year changes (perhaps as a result of an audit). Some courts hold that when
you fail to file an amended state return in this situation, your initial state
return is deemed “unfiled.” The result is that your entire state tax — and not
just the amount that would have been added had you amended the state
return — can no longer be discharged in a Chapter 7 filing.
Addressing Taxes Other Than 
Income Taxes
As a general rule, nonincome taxes (with the exception of trust fund taxes,
which we discuss in the following section) are dischargeable in a Chapter 7
or a Chapter 13, if whatever caused the tax liability occurred more than three
years before the bankruptcy filing date.
Paying trust fund employment taxes
Employers are required to withhold certain taxes, known as trust fund taxes,
from employees’ paychecks and turn them over to the government on a regu-
lar basis throughout the year. If these taxes aren’t paid, the government can
go after the company, the owners of the company, and the company employ-
ees who were responsible for remitting the funds to the government and
233
Chapter 15: Give unto Caesar: Using Bankruptcy to Deal with Tax Debts

intentionally failed to do so. These taxes aren’t dischargeable in any type of
bankruptcy unless they’re barred by the statute of limitations. Also, they’re
priority debts that must be paid in full under any Chapter 13 plan.
When a business is going down the tubes, paying trade creditors and letting
employment taxes slide to continue to operate is tempting. This strategy
almost always is a mistake. Employment taxes should be the first thing paid,
not the last.
Deciding whether to pay real and 
personal property taxes
Certain advantages and disadvantages can be realized when deciding
between paying or not paying real and personal property taxes, and you need
to make a smart decision about what you’re going to do.
Real property taxes
Real property taxes — taxes imposed on land and buildings, — are typically a
problem only when you want to keep the property. That’s because these
taxes are assessed against the property, not against the owner personally.
Nonetheless, the taxes are liens and must be paid if you intend to keep the
property. In addition, failure to pay real property taxes probably constitutes a
default under your mortgage, the same as when you fail to make your mort-
gage payments.
Personal property taxes
Personal property taxes — taxes paid on items that aren’t real estate (such as
cars) — aren’t dischargeable if, under local law, they are assessed against the
owner personally rather than against only the property and are less than one
year old.
Obtaining Loans to Pay Your Taxes
If you borrow money to pay nondischargeable taxes, the loan is not dis-
chargeable in Chapter 7. But you may be able to get rid of it in Chapter 13,
unless you borrowed the money while contemplating bankruptcy. Also,
replacing an obligation to pay priority taxes with a nonpriority debt may
make it tougher to pass the Means Test — that new test to figure out if you
have means to repay some of your debts (see Chapter 5).
234
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

The federal government and some states encourage folks to use credit cards
to pay their taxes. Paying taxes with your credit cards is seldom a good idea
if a bankruptcy is in your future.
In any event, don’t pay any large debts prior to bankruptcy before reading
Chapter 19 to see how a bankruptcy trustee can sometimes recover this
money, which can leave you worse off than if you had never paid the debt in
the first place.

ankruptcy is designed to give honest debtors a second chance, not to
provide a safe haven for crooks and scalawags. So, for the most part, 
if you intentionally cheat someone or purposely hurt someone, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code isn’t your safety net. Still, bankruptcy law coexists with
other laws and balances competing interests — legally, politically, and
morally. That’s always a difficult balancing act.
For example, society has a powerful interest in seeing you get back on your
feet. Only then can you rejoin the productive and taxpaying citizens who
serve as cogs in the economic and social engine. At the same time, society
has an interest in ensuring that those whom you’ve harmed don’t get short-
changed simply because you’re now broke. So how can the law put you back
on your feet, without kicking the legs out from under innocent bystanders?
Sometimes it takes the Wisdom of Solomon — plus a dose of sincere remorse
on your part.
Many debts that arise from intentional misconduct can’t be wiped out in a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy, but you have a shot at getting out from under that
cloud by filing a Chapter 13. If you demonstrate your contrition and genuinely
pay as much as you can under a Chapter 13 repayment plan, even your debts
for intentional wrongdoing may be eliminated.
If you’ve been convicted of a crime of violence, the victim may ask that a
Chapter 7 case be dismissed. The definition of crime of violence is quite
broad and includes the threat of violence or, in some situations, conduct that
carries only the threat of violence, such as burglary.

Also, if you’re being sued for intentionally or recklessly inflicting serious per-
sonal injuries, a glitch under BARF allows a court to delay discharging your
debts. But nobody yet knows how that will play out. So, for now, it’s just
something to keep in mind and discuss with your attorney.
In this chapter, we look at debts stemming from fraud and other misdeeds
and explore your options.
Dealing with Debts Resulting from Fraud
So, what’s fraud? It doesn’t mean that you’re merely unable to pay your
debts. Just because you’re broke doesn’t mean that you committed fraud, or
anything of the sort. If that were the case, no one ever would get bankruptcy
relief. Still, creditors may accuse you of fraud if they think that doing so pre-
vents the elimination of your debt to them. But they have to prove that
 You knowingly made a false representation.
 You intended to deceive the creditor.
 The creditor actually and justifiably relied on your representation.
 As a result of your misrepresentation, the creditor suffered damage.
That may be a bunch to prove, but it can be done — as we explain in the 
following sections.
Debts from fraud are nondischargeable nonpriority debts. See Chapter 13 for
the difference between priority and nonpriority debts.
Charges on the eve of bankruptcy
Congress and the courts aren’t particularly fond of people accumulating new
debts right before they file bankruptcy. It just smells like you racked up debts
with no intention of paying your bills. Eve-of-bankruptcy spending binges is
really bad karma. Don’t risk it.
Luxury purchases totaling more than $500 within 90 days of bankruptcy and
credit cash advances totaling more than $750 within 70 days of bankruptcy
are presumed fraudulent. For that reason, it’s not a good idea to put bank-
ruptcy attorney fees on your credit card. (See Chapter 14 for more on credit
cards and fraud.)
238
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

False financial statements
Did you ever wonder why some lenders require such a complicated financial
statement even though you own only a few items? The answer is simple:
Debts obtained through falsely written financial statements aren’t discharge-
able. Creditors know this rule, and some try to provide the rope with which
to hang yourself in the event you end up in bankruptcy.
Some lenders actually encourage you to exaggerate your income or the value
of your assets. Then, if you ever file bankruptcy, they dig out the financial
statement, point to any inaccuracies, and claim that their debt isn’t dis-
chargeable because you provided false information on your financial state-
ment. Sneaky, huh?
The courts think so, and fortunately they require the creditor to prove that
you intentionally lied and that the creditor reasonably relied on the misrepre-
sentation in making the loan. In other words, they must show not only that
the information was inaccurate, but also that you knew it was inaccurate and
that they wouldn’t have given you a loan had they known the truth.
Be on your guard whenever a lender asks for a financial statement. Be
scrupulously honest and don’t ever let anyone coax you into exaggerating.
The loan officer may be setting a trap. (See Chapter 14 for more information
on whether the information you put on a credit-card application ever is
deemed a false financial statement.)
Bad checks
Writing bad checks is considered fraudulent only when the creditor can
prove that you knew, or should have known, that the check would bounce.
239
Chapter 16: The Devil Made Me Do It: Fines, Fraud, and Other Foibles
Chapter 7: No escape for a coverup
When Zeke sold his house to Brenda, he
assured her that his humble abode was solid as
a rock, but that wasn’t exactly true.
Actually, the foundation had shifted and the
walls were cracking, and Zeke knew it. In fact,
he covered the cracks with paint so that Brenda
and her real estate agent couldn’t see the 
evidence. Brenda bought the house and 
soon discovered she was facing thousands of
dollars of repair work. She sued, so Zeke filed a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy to escape liability. The
judge wasn’t about to let Zeke play the system
for a sucker and gave Brenda the green light to
pursue her fraud claim.

Most creditors won’t bother unless the check is a big one. So, as a practical
matter, debts from rubber checks frequently are discharged. Just the same,
banks blacklist people who don’t make good on checks, and you may have
trouble obtaining a new checking account. Keeping your checkbook balanced
is definitely a good idea.
In any case, never let a creditor talk you into signing a postdated check. If it
turns out that you can’t cover the check, the creditor may claim that you
knew the check was bad and, for that reason, claim that the debt shouldn’t
be wiped out. Or, even worse, the creditor may file criminal bad-check
charges against you and have you carted off to the hoosegow in the paddy
wagon.
Receiving undeserved welfare and 
unemployment benefits
Someone receiving more Social Security, unemployment, welfare, or other
government benefits than they should have is not all that uncommon. If the
bankruptcy court is convinced that you fraudulently obtained these benefits,
you’re obligated to repay them.
If getting more than your fair share was just a mistake — theirs or yours —
any repayment obligation can be wiped out. The key wrinkle is whether
you’re still receiving benefits.
240
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 
Payday loans
Payday loans are an epidemic of New Age loan
sharking that are spreading at an alarming rate.
Here’s how they work. Outfits accept a post-
dated check in exchange for cash, with the
understanding that you’ll buy back the check for
the amount of cash advanced, plus a hefty fee,
whenever you receive your paycheck. The
effective interest rate on these loans can run up
to 500 percent, and even higher!
They make this loan knowing full well that when
you wrote the check, you didn’t have enough
money in your account to cover it. In fact, they
hope that you won’t be able to redeem your
check for a long time because each time
payday rolls around and you don’t buy back the
check, they charge additional fees. The under-
lying threat is that if you don’t eventually pay,
you’ll be charged with fraud.
That’s baloney! There’s no fraud here — at
least, not on the customer’s part. These loans
should be dischargeable in bankruptcy the
same as any other debt.
If you think that the only people engaging in this
type of lending have thick necks and crooked
noses, you’re wrong. Some of our nation’s
largest banks are in the payday loan business.
They’re in the lobbying and political contribution
business, too.

Under a principle called recoupment, some courts enable the offended gov-
ernment agency to effect a reduction in your future benefits to recover its
loss even though any obligation to repay was discharged in bankruptcy.
Willful and Malicious Behavior
Damages from conduct considered willful and malicious conduct are not dis-
chargeable in Chapter 7, but may be dischargeable in Chapter 13 unless they
involved personal injuries and were assessed against you by a court or
administrative agency prior to bankruptcy. In Chapter 13, you still have to
convince the bankruptcy court that you’re making your best effort to pay as
much of the damages as possible under its plan.
As you may expect, determining whether conduct is so awful that it’s willful
and malicious usually isn’t very easy.
The United States Supreme Court has ruled that simple negligence doesn’t
rise to the level of malice, even if you really screwed up (Kawaauhau v.
Geiger, 523 U.S. 57, 118 S.Ct. 974 [1998]). For example, if you were stirring
your coffee while driving and accidentally rear-ended a school bus, that’s neg-
ligence. Although you didn’t mean to cause an accident, you nevertheless did
so because you weren’t paying attention. On the other hand, if you intention-
ally rammed the bus in a fit of road rage, that’s malice.
Creditors sometimes claim that a debtor was guilty of willful and malicious
conduct when she sold or gave away the collateral she used to secure her
loans — an allegation known in legal circles as conversion of collateral.
Some department stores take a security interest (which gives them the right
to repossess if you don’t pay; see Chapter 11 for more on security interests)
in items purchased on the charge accounts their stores offer to customers.
These stores sometimes claim that someone who sells or gives away an item
before it’s paid off acted willfully and maliciously. Say, for example, that you
charged a lawn mower on an ABC Store account, and the store retained a
security interest in that item. Sometime later, you sell the mower at a garage
sale, even though you haven’t paid off your ABC Store account, and spent
your proceeds. ABC may later accuse you of acting with malice if you don’t
pay off the account.
In a situation like this one, most bankruptcy courts reject the store’s conver-
sion of collateral claim, unless ABC can prove that you were aware of the fine
print in the charge account agreement and knew that you weren’t supposed
to sell the mower until it was paid for. Few consumers actually have any clue
what’s in the fine print of their charge-card documentation; however, in
exceptional cases where the customer clearly is fully aware that she’s doing a
bad thing, courts rule in favor of the stores.
241
Chapter 16: The Devil Made Me Do It: Fines, Fraud, and Other Foibles

Even though some liabilities from alleged willful and malicious conduct are
potentially dischargeable in Chapter 13, the judge scrutinizes your case,
making sure that it’s filed in a good faith attempt to repay as much as possi-
ble and not just to stiff the victim. Remember, when criminal charges are
brought and a conviction results in a fine or restitution, these obligations
aren’t dischargeable. (See the section “Covering Fines, Penalties, and
Restitution Orders,” later in this chapter.)
Whenever someone sues you claiming that you’re guilty of fraud or other
misconduct, see a lawyer immediately. If you do nothing, the person suing
you automatically wins, possibly preventing you from later claiming your
innocence.
Congress wanted to make doubly sure that thieves can’t escape liability by
filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy. So, in addition to addressing obligations arising
from willful and malicious conduct, Congress enacted a separate provision
making debts arising from larceny and embezzlement nondischargeable and
nonpriority in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.
Covering Fines, Penalties, and
Restitution Orders
The courts and Congress are like ships passing in the night when it comes to
addressing court-ordered fines, penalties, and restitution (monetary compen-
sation paid to the victim of a crime). Neither seems to understand exactly
what the other is talking about. Making matters worse is the fact that these
types of debts frequently arise from efforts by the states to enforce criminal
or regulatory laws, and federal courts generally don’t like stepping on a
state’s toes in these matters. The first problem in figuring out what impact
bankruptcy has on these debts is identifying the nature of the obligation as
accurately as possible.

Rolex scheme falls through
Brad charged a $14,000 diamond-studded Rolex
watch at Acme Jewelers. Because the pur-
chase was so large, the store manager carefully
explained to Brad that the watch was collateral
for the account. He then had Brad sign papers
to that effect.
Three weeks later, Brad sold the watch for
$1,500 and used the money to catch up on car
payments. Shortly thereafter, he filed Chapter 7.
The court found Brad guilty of willful and mali-
cious conduct, and his debt to Acme wasn’t 
discharged.

Criminal fines
Fines that are assessed upon conviction of a crime can’t be wiped out in a
Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13.
Although you may propose paying off the fine in full during a Chapter 13 case,
you still can be confronted with problems. First of all, because they’re not
priority debts, most courts won’t allow you to pay them off while other unse-
cured creditors are left holding the bag. Second, prosecutors may seek to
incarcerate you for failure to pay a criminal fine, even though it’s included in
your Chapter 13 plan.
It may be better for you to pay the fine before filing bankruptcy, but don’t
forget that’s potentially dangerous. The trustee may decide that you
attempted to play favorites with whatever cash you have (see Chapter 19).
Your lawyer’s knowledge of the policies of local courts and prosecutors is
critical in this situation.
Restitution
Courts commonly require anyone who injures another person or damages
property to pay restitution to the victim. That simply means that if your neigh-
bor has to shell out $300 for the vet because you kicked Fido in the head, you
have to reimburse your neighbor. If you’re ordered to pay restitution as part
of a criminal conviction, the obligation is treated the same as a criminal fine.
Say, for example, that you’re convicted of vandalism in a criminal court and
ordered to compensate the victim for damages as part of your sentence. This
kind of obligation isn’t dischargeable in a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13. On the
other hand, if criminal charges weren’t brought against you, but the victim
sued you and obtained a judgment, that kind of obligation would not be
excepted from discharge (nondischargeable) as “restitution.” However, it may
be nondischargeable in a Chapter 7 on the basis of fraud, willful and mali-
cious conduct, or embezzlement. Still, you may be able to discharge the claim
in a Chapter 13 if you did not cause any personal injuries.
Noncriminal fines and penalties
In most instances, penalties imposed on you for noncriminal wrongdoing —
such as watering your lawn during a drought or (in some places) not cleaning
up after your pooch — are dischargeable in a Chapter 13, but not in a
Chapter 7.
243
Chapter 16: The Devil Made Me Do It: Fines, Fraud, and Other Foibles

But even when you can wipe out the debt, you still may be in for big trouble
with the governmental entity imposing the fine or penalty. Many states have
diversion programs where people avoid criminal prosecution by undergoing
counseling. They’re also expected to eventually pay for the services used in
diversion programs. For example, the court may give you a break on a mari-
juana charge if you agree to undergo and pay for drug counseling. If you don’t
pay for the program, criminal charges may be revived.
Motor-vehicle fines
Unpaid traffic fines and parking tickets present a couple of questions. The
first is whether the obligation is dischargeable, and that depends on whether
your local courts consider the violation a crime or merely an infraction.
Parking tickets and equipment violations (broken headlights, a noisy muffler,
bald tires, and so on) typically are considered infractions, so fines for them
are dischargeable in a Chapter 13, but not in a Chapter 7. Serious moving vio-
lations (reckless driving or driving with a suspended license) typically are
considered crimes, and fines for them aren’t dischargeable in a Chapter 7 or a
Chapter 13.
Many states will yank your driver’s license for unpaid fines, even those
involving infractions. If the fine is dischargeable, the Bankruptcy Code
requires that the state restore your driving privileges. But that doesn’t mean
that the bankruptcy court will order the state to do so. You may find yourself
in the middle of a huge power struggle between state and federal authorities.
For those reasons, it’s better to file Chapter 13 before your license is actually
suspended or revoked. Filing bankruptcy will halt suspension or revocation
proceedings (see Chapter 6 for a discussion of the automatic stay), enabling
you to keep your license while your lawyer tries to resolve any tug of war
between the bankruptcy and state courts. However, if you’re dealing with a
criminal fine, the state doesn’t have to restore your license, and bankruptcy
won’t interrupt suspension or revocation proceedings.
Accepting Responsibility for 
Drunken-Driving Injuries
Patience for drunken or drugged drivers is at an all-time low. Getting blasted
and mowing down a few mailboxes is no longer considered funny.

substances cannot be discharged in either Chapter 7 or Chapter 13. Due to
what was probably a drafting error, liabilities from aircraft accidents are
nondischargeable but they’re not priority claims, while liabilities from driving
or boating are nondischargeable priority debts.

F
inancial distress and divorce often go hand-in-hand. Sometimes, financial
woes cause the divorce. Other times, divorce leads to financial disaster.
In balancing your money concerns with your domestic issues, you need to
carefully weigh your options, and their implications, in divorce court and
bankruptcy court.
The two main reasons you may want to plow through this rather difficult and
dour chapter are
 You owe money under a divorce decree that already has been entered
and wonder whether bankruptcy can help you escape, or at least
manage, these obligations.
 You’re involved in a divorce right now, or thinking about it, and want to
know how bankruptcy will affect things.
This chapter addresses these complicated issues.
Introducing Key Points
Because divorce can really complicate your bankruptcy (and vice versa), you
need to know some basics. Although hard and fast rules are awfully hard to
come by in this area, several constants to keep in mind are that

 Bankruptcy deals only with debts in existence on the day you file. If a
divorce decree creates financial obligations after the petition date, they
won’t be included in bankruptcy.
 Property divisions completed prior to bankruptcy aren’t debts that you
can avoid. For example, if a divorce court enters an order transferring an
asset to you, it’s yours even when your ex-spouse files bankruptcy. But if
the divorce court orders your ex to transfer the property and he hasn’t
done so prior to bankruptcy, he may be able to escape this kind of debt
through bankruptcy.
 Some liens imposed by divorce courts may be avoidable by your ex if he
files bankruptcy because they’re deemed judicial liens impairing his
homestead. Insisting that your ex sign a mortgage (which is not avoid-
able as a judicial lien) to secure the debt is a smart thing to do. See
Chapter 12 for more on judicial liens.
 The fact that you or even the divorce court calls an obligation nondis-
chargeable support isn’t binding on a bankruptcy court, which looks at
the underlying situation and makes its own determinations.
 If you’re entitled to receive support when you file bankruptcy, most, if not
all that money is exempt (off-limits to creditors) in your bankruptcy. On
the other hand, if you expect to receive a property division, chances are
that it won’t be exempt. See Chapter 10 for more on exempt property.
 If you become entitled to a property division within 180 days of bank-
ruptcy, you can lose it to the trustee.
Planning Your Strategy
If a divorce looms in your future, careful bankruptcy planning can
 Reduce tensions between you and your soon-to-be ex-spouse
 Make divorce simpler
 Help produce a marital settlement that both parties can live with that
will hold up in a future bankruptcy
On the other hand, blundering through a divorce without carefully consider-
ing the possible effects of bankruptcy may bring results that neither party
wants, such as
 Unproductive and expensive fights about who’s going to pay certain bills,
especially when both are better off eliminating the debts in bankruptcy
 Hostilities resulting from one party believing he got the short end of the
stick
 Unnecessary losses of assets to a bankruptcy trustee
248
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Exploring your financial obligations
Basically two types of financial obligations arise from divorce: support to 
sustain the kids and your former spouse (domestic support obligations under
the new bankruptcy law) and the issue of property that’s been divided
between the two of you. Bankruptcy handles each commitment differently.
Generally, support obligations aren’t wiped out in a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13,
while outstanding property division obligations can be wiped out in a Chapter
13 but not in Chapter 7. You need to keep in mind a couple of principles.
First, financial obligations arising from a divorce decree (or a marital settle-
ment agreement adopted by the divorce court) may require payment of
 Money for child support and schooling.
 Life and health insurance premiums.
 Alimony or maintenance for your ex-spouse.
 Your ex-spouse’s divorce attorney fees.
 A sum of money to compensate your ex for his interest in joint property.
For example, say that the divorce court awards you the marital resi-
dence worth $80,000 but requires you to pay your ex $40,000 for his
interest in the property. As part of the deal, the court may actually
impose a lien on the home to secure payment of the $40,000.
 Certain debts so that your ex doesn’t have to pay them.
If you’re wondering which of these is support and which are property divi-
sions, jump ahead to the section “Figuring out which obligations are in ‘the
nature of’ support,” later in this chapter.
Second, the decree may also actually transfer specific assets to your former
partner. For example, the court may enter a Qualified Domestic Relations
Order (QDRO) that gives your ex-spouse immediate ownership in part of your
entire retirement plan. If the court enters a QDRO, your ex-spouse has an
immediate ownership interest in your pension. In other words, he owns it.
You don’t.
Or the divorce court can award jointly owned property to one spouse. Say,
for example, that you and your soon-to-be ex jointly own your home plus a
rental house. A divorce court can rule that you own the home by yourself,
and your ex gets the rental property.
In other words, the divorce court can
 Order you to make payments in the future that represent either support
or a property division. These payments may be secured or unsecured.
 Actually transfer ownership of certain assets to one party.
249
Chapter 17: Till Debt Due Us Part: Bankruptcy and Divorce

A little later in this chapter, in the sections “Understanding How Support
Obligations Are Treated in Bankruptcy,” and “Understanding How Property
Divisions are Treated in Bankruptcy,” we talk about how bankruptcy affects
support obligations and property divisions.
Doing what’s best for both spouses
If you and your mate were struggling financially when living together, things
are just going to get worse when you have to maintain two households.
Although a substantial emotional element is obvious, you’ll both be much
better off when you can work toward a financial solution that benefits each of
you. Doing so isn’t really that hard, assuming, of course, that you can
respond rationally rather than emotionally. Work toward structuring a marital
settlement agreement that
 Both parties can live with
 Actually divides your existing property
 Ensures that sums to be paid by one spouse to the other will survive the
bankruptcy of each and, it is hoped, will be exempt
Sure, you can play hardball and insist that your spouse pay all the bills, but
you’ll probably find out that you’re doing nothing more than cutting off your
nose to spite your face. Although the divorce court may order one party to
pay the bill, that doesn’t necessarily protect the other from creditors. Instead
of playing one-upmanship, you and your mate need to reach an agreement
where credit-card debts and other bills eventually are wiped out in bank-
ruptcy. If you can do that, your mate will be in a far better position to handle
any support obligations — and everyone will be happier.
Nevertheless, you still need to notify all creditors on joint accounts in writing
that you won’t be responsible for any future charges made by your spouse.
Although doing so won’t relieve you from charges that already were made, it
should keep you off the hook for future charges.
Completing property transfers
If a divorce court actually transfers an asset to your ex-spouse, you don’t
really have any debt to handle in bankruptcy because you no longer own the
property; your spouse does. Sorry. For example, if the court enters a QDRO,
(see our earlier discussion of Qualified Domestic Relations Orders in the sec-
tion “Exploring your financial obligations”), your ex has an immediate owner-
ship interest in your pension. There’s simply no debt to wipe out or manage.
250
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Timing it right
When bankruptcy and divorce intersect, careful timing can make the differ-
ence between success and disaster. Although each situation is unique, as a
general rule,
 When you have no assets to divide, no third-party debts (like joint
credit-card accounts) to allocate, and no support issues, you need to file
bankruptcy prior to filing for divorce. That way, you can file a joint bank-
ruptcy, getting two for the price of one and making your divorce much
simpler.
 In other cases, filing and completing your divorce before actually filing
bankruptcy usually is best.
Although delaying bankruptcy until after the divorce is finished ordinarily is
better, starting to make plans for your bankruptcy nevertheless makes sense.
251
Chapter 17: Till Debt Due Us Part: Bankruptcy and Divorce
A success story
Bob and Mabel own a home worth $100,000. It
is subject to a mortgage of $80,000 ($20,000
equity). They also own an SUV worth $15,000
free and clear. However, they owe more than
$50,000 in credit-card debts they racked up
during their stormy marriage. The homestead
exemption in their state is $25,000, and the vehi-
cle exemption is $2,000. Their pensions are
entirely exempt.
Bob and Mabel agree that because Mabel is
getting custody of their two children, she also
needs to have the house with its $20,000 equity.
Knowing that they’d lose the SUV in bankruptcy,
they sell it, and Bob receives the $15,000 pro-
ceeds because he’s giving up the house. To
make things equal, Mabel gives Bob $5,000 from
her pension.
Bob then takes the $20,000 and makes a down
payment on a new home and buys a $2,000 car.
Bob agrees to make child support payments of
$500 per month.
After the divorce is complete, Bob and Mabel
each file separate Chapter 7 bankruptcies.
(They can’t file jointly even if they want to
because they no longer are married.) The
credit-card debts are eliminated, neither of
them loses any property, and Bob’s monthly
support payments are manageable.

Understanding How Support Obligations
Are Treated in Bankruptcy
Although bankruptcy won’t eliminate support obligations, it may ease your
distress by erasing your other debts. Additionally, with a Chapter 13 repay-
ment plan, you can gradually catch up with your outstanding support, paying
during your three-to five-year plan.
Support obligations in Chapter 7
You can’t do much with support obligations in a Chapter 7 liquidation bank-
ruptcy. And the automatic stay doesn’t protect you from collection efforts.
Chapter 7 still eliminates your other debts, and that makes meeting your sup-
port requirements easier. And if yours is an asset case — where property is
liquidated and some money is paid to creditors — you can file a proof of
claim, thus ensuring that the lion’s share of the funds go toward your support
obligation. Chapter 6 explains the claims process.
Support obligations in Chapter 13
Although you can’t wipe out support responsibilities in a Chapter 13, you can
at least get your spouse off your back and pay accrued support during the
three- to five-year duration of your Chapter 13 plan.
252
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 
Sham divorces
You may be tempted to agree with your spouse
that he gets the mine and you get the shaft so
that creditors can’t go after your assets. For
example, if, as a couple, you have few joint
debts and your spouse doesn’t have many debts
in his own name, it may be appealing to give him
everything in the divorce and then file bank-
ruptcy. Maybe you’ll eventually settle up later,
but, in any event, you’d rather see him get your
assets than your creditors.
Don’t do it.
When you file bankruptcy after a divorce, the
trustee makes sure that any property settlement
was a fair transaction in which you received
valuable property in exchange for property you
gave up. If you didn’t, the trustee can recover
the property that your ex received. In addition, if
you pulled this stunt within one year of filing
bankruptcy, you may not be eligible for a
Chapter 7 discharge (see Chapter 19).

In a Chapter 13, support obligations are broken down into two categories:
 Back support that you owe when you file
 Support that accrues in the future
Back support can — and actually must — be paid in full over the duration of
your plan from the payments you make to the trustee. Also, you must keep
up with support payments coming due after the petition date. If you don’t,
your Chapter 13 plan cannot be confirmed (see Chapter 6), none of your
debts will be wiped out, and your ex-spouse (or a governmental agency col-
lecting support) can ask the state court to force you to pay and also have the
bankruptcy court dismiss your bankruptcy.
Support payments that are due after you file for bankruptcy are treated as a
budgeted living expense that you pay directly, just like your rent or utility
bill. But beware: The automatic stay doesn’t provide much protection against
support collection, and you may jeopardize your whole Chapter 13 case by
letting postpetition support obligations slide. (For more about postpetition
obligations, see Chapter 20.) If your postpetition support payments are
unreasonably high, the place to look for relief is divorce court. Bankruptcy
courts won’t allow themselves to get dragged into the divorce business.
253
Chapter 17: Till Debt Due Us Part: Bankruptcy and Divorce
Chapter 13 reduces marital obligations 
to manageable amounts
George and Donna divorce after seven years of
marriage. George agrees to pay $1,000 per
month alimony to Donna and $45,000 in
exchange for her interest in the couple’s vaca-
tion home. George then loses his job, and 
doesn’t pay either of these obligations. He even
loses the vacation home because he can’t make
the mortgage payments on it.
After two years, George finally lands a good 
job, but by then he owes Donna $24,000 in back
support, still owes her the $45,000, and he racks
up $13,000 in credit-card debts to boot.
George files Chapter 13, and the court approves
a plan where he pays Donna the $24,000 over
five years and continues making current $1,000
payments to her. If George completes his plan,
the $45,000 property division is wiped out along
with his credit-card bills.

Figuring out which obligations are 
in “the nature of” support
Determining whether a particular obligation is support or a property division
often is difficult.
Here’s why: Assume that Grace agrees to accept less alimony because her
husband, George, promises to pay all their joint debts (keeping in mind that
even if the divorce court adopts this agreement and assigns these debts to
George, the creditors can still come after Grace if George doesn’t pay).
Promises to pay third-party debts frequently are labeled as property divi-
sions by the parties or by the divorce court. But, in this particular case, isn’t
it actually a form of support?
That depends.
A bankruptcy judge can disregard labels, making up his own mind about the
true nature of the obligation. In fact, a bankruptcy court doesn’t even need to
agree with the divorce judge’s decision on the question. If the divorce court
characterizes an obligation as being in the nature of support, specifically
ruling that it can’t be wiped out in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court can
reach the exact opposite conclusion, ruling that the obligation is actually a
property division.
Bankruptcy is a federal law, and, under our Constitution, national laws over-
rule inconsistent state laws.
Focusing on financial conditions 
at the time of your divorce
Although bankruptcy courts consider a number of factors, they like to zero in
on the financial condition of the parties at the time of the divorce.
If the relative financial situation of the parties at that time indicates that sup-
port was necessary, bankruptcy courts usually find that an award is in the
nature of support, regardless of how it is labeled.
If your spouse is barely able to meet basic expenses and has few job skills
while you have substantial earning ability, a bankruptcy court probably will
rule that the disputed obligation is support, regardless of whether it consists
of a lump-sum payment, periodic payments, or a promise to pay a third-party
debt. For example, suppose that Jane supports Dan for ten years while he
completes his medical training, and the divorce court orders Dan to make
payments to her equal to a percentage of the value of his medical practice.
254
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Few courts ever conclude that the obligation is anything other than support,
at least to the extent that such payments are necessary for Jane to support
herself.
Certain third-party debts are more likely than others to fall under the support
umbrella. For example, when a wife is awarded the marital home and her hus-
band is ordered to make the mortgage payments, the obligation is probably
support, especially if the wife has custody of children.
Many bankruptcy courts also deem as support a husband’s obligation to pay
a car loan on an essential vehicle awarded to his wife if, at the time of the
divorce, she can’t afford the payments herself. Similarly, courts almost
always rule that when one spouse is ordered to pay the other’s divorce attor-
ney, this obligation is support, not a property division.
Looking at factors that 
some courts consider
Because the determination about whether an obligation is in the nature of
support isn’t always obvious, courts examine the circumstances to make
those kinds of decisions. Bankruptcy judges consider a number of factors,
including whether
 Children are involved. Payments to an ex-spouse with custody of the
parties’ minor children are more likely to be deemed support.
 Marked differences existed between the relative incomes of you and
your former spouse at the time of your divorce. A key question is
whether the recipient actually needed (at the time of divorce) financial
assistance from his ex-spouse in order to make ends meet.
 The obligation terminates on death or remarriage of the recipient
spouse. Traditionally, support obligations end upon the recipient’s
death or remarriage, but property divisions don’t.
 The obligation is subject to modification based on changes in circum-
stances. Support obligations tend to be modifiable, whereas property
divisions don’t.
 The parties treat the obligation as support on their income tax returns —
with the person making payments deducting them and the person receiv-
ing them treating them as income. If the paying spouse claims that pay-
ments were tax-deductible support payments rather than nondeductible
property division payments, the bankruptcy judge will be skeptical if he
changes his tune and tries to claim that they’re not support obligations.
255
Chapter 17: Till Debt Due Us Part: Bankruptcy and Divorce

Understanding How Property Divisions
Are Treated in Bankruptcy
If a marital obligation is a property settlement, you can wipe it out in a
Chapter 13, but not in Chapter 7. But you still may have to deal with any lien
imposed by the divorce court. For example, if the divorce court orders you to
pay $10,000 as a property division and imposes a lien on your home to secure
payment, you must deal with that lien even when your personal liability on
the debt is canceled.
As we discuss in Chapter 11, judgment liens that impair your exemption can
be avoided (unless they secure a support obligation). When it comes to judg-
ment liens securing property divisions, the Supreme Court (see Farrey v.
Sanderfoot. 500 U.S. 291, 111 S.Ct. 1825 [1991]), in a rather convoluted fashion,
has ruled that you can’t avoid the judgment lien if it’s imposed to secure pay-
ment for your half of jointly owned property awarded to you in the divorce.
Suppose, for a moment, that the divorce court awards you sole ownership of
an $80,000 home — owned jointly with your spouse — and then imposes a lien
on the property to secure payment to your spouse of $40,000 for his share of
the home. That kind of lien isn’t avoidable in bankruptcy.
On the other hand, suppose that the divorce court imposes a lien against
property that you own in your own name. That kind of lien can be avoidable
in bankruptcy to the extent that it impairs your homestead exemption. See
Chapter 11 for more on eliminating judgment liens on homesteads.
Other Grounds for Bankruptcy-Proof
Marital Debts
Because more than one reason can exist for making a debt nondischargeable,
you may encounter some other situations where a property division isn’t dis-
chargeable even in a Chapter 7.
A debtor may be guilty of fraud or some other type of intentional misconduct
in negotiating a marital settlement agreement. When one spouse agrees to a
marital settlement with no intention of performing, that may constitute fraud.
Or if he withdraws and spends money from his pension after it was awarded
to his ex-wife, he may be guilty of theft.

 Eliminating student loans in bankruptcy
 Getting rid of student loans without bankruptcy
A
college education is one of the best investments you can make in your
future — sometimes. It can also be one of the very worst.
Today’s college graduates earn 40 percent more than people with only high
school diplomas. But the cost of a college education is well beyond what
most people, or their parents, can afford without student loans. So, the lend-
ing of money for higher education has evolved into an industry unto itself.
Today, one of every 12 Americans owes money on student loans.
This chapter explains the complicated workings of the student-loan industry,
your bankruptcy options, and your nonbankruptcy options.
Understanding the Student-Loan
Industry
When student-loan programs function as intended, everybody wins. With
their enhanced earnings, graduates can pay off their loans without serious
difficulty, and, by earning more, they pay more in federal and state income
taxes. It’s a win-win-win situation for the borrower, the lender, and society —
when it works out that way. Unfortunately, that doesn’t always happen. When
you buy a house, the bank assesses the property, ensuring not only that
you’re paying a reasonable price, but also that the home is worth enough to
cover the loan if you happen to default. But with educational loans, no one
seems to care whether a particular course of study has any economic value.

Students often incur a fortune in debt to earn a personally fulfilling but eco-
nomically worthless degree. After that, they’re saddled with enormous debt
from their school loans, and an earning potential that’s no better than it was
before they went to school. Frequently, they’re up to their necks in debt and
have no realistic prospect of paying it off in the foreseeable future.
Bankruptcy, however, isn’t always — or even usually — the best way to deal
with student loans. For a number of reasons, some better than others, law-
makers have made discharging student-loan obligations in bankruptcy very
difficult.
Members of Congress want to ensure that everyone seeking a college educa-
tion has that option, and they have a vested interest in appeasing the lending
industry, which is ever so generous with campaign donations and lobbying
dollars. So, Congress creates and sustains an environment where lenders are
willing to make loans because chances are good that they’ll make money
from them.
If you’re to have even a fighting chance of eliminating your student loans, you
need a firm understanding of how the process works. The first step is figuring
out who holds your loan, which isn’t nearly as simple as you may think. You
then need to know just what the loan holder can do if you don’t pay.
Tracing Your Loans
Student loans frequently are moving targets because they constantly are
assigned to various players in a huge and hugely complex industry. Although
the guaranteed student-loan program is federal, these loans may originate
from any of three sources:
 Private lenders (Federal Family Education Loans, or FFEL)
 Schools (Perkins loans)
 The United States Department of Education (Federal Direct Loans)
After your loan goes into default, figuring out who to deal with can be tough.
It could be a guarantee agency, a private collector hired by a guarantee
agency, the Department of Education, a collection agency hired by the
department, or the school. You need to keep these points in mind:
 If a private lender makes the loan, it frequently turns right around and
sells it to a lender specializing in student loans, such as the Student
Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae).
 Either the original lender or the purchaser of a loan may hire a loan ser-
vicer to receive payments and keep track of how much is owed.
258
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

 When a loan is delinquent for at least 270 days and therefore deemed in
default, the loanholder (except where the original lender was the
Department of Education) is paid off by state guarantee agencies. The
state guarantee agency then goes after you or hires a private bill collec-
tor to do the dirty work.
 If the guarantee agency can’t collect, the federal government bails it out
and inherits the problem.
 The Department of Education also hires private agencies to collect the
loans it holds, regardless of whether the loans originated with the
department or were acquired through the guarantee process.
When the loan isn’t yet in default, you may find at least a temporary fix for
your student loan burden by checking out repayment plans available from
the original lender (or the purchaser of the loan, such as Sallie Mae), the
school (in the case of Perkins loans), or the Department of Education, if the
loan originated from the government.
If you’ve recently received a collection letter, that’s a pretty good starting
point in hunting down the holder of your loan. You can call the Federal
Student Aid Information Center at 800-433-3243, which likely will reveal the
name and address of the holder of your loan. If your loan came directly from
the Department of Education, you can call the Direct Loan Servicing Center at
800-848-0979. If you’re still having trouble, you can contact the ombudsman
office in the Department of Education at www.ombudsman.ed.gov or call
877-557-2575.
Knowing What They Can Do 
If You Don’t Pay
If you’re behind on your student-loan payments, you won’t receive any more
student loans without reestablishing your eligibility or rehabilitating the loan.
(See the section entitled “Requesting a reasonable and affordable payment
plan,” later in this chapter.) Collection can be enforced by
 Lawsuits
 Garnishment (where money is taken from your wages even without filing
a lawsuit) of up to 15 percent of your net income
 Interception of your income tax refunds
Likewise, after your loan goes into default, collection costs of up to 25 percent
may be added.
259
Chapter 18: Student Loans and Other Mind Games

Managing Student Loans 
with Bankruptcy
The statute of limitations on student loans is pretty much gone. So, no matter
how old the loan is, you may still have to pay it back. And, if that isn’t bad
enough, you can’t wipe it out (or discharge it) in any kind of bankruptcy 
without first showing that repayment poses an “undue hardship” — a term
Congress left for the courts to define.
Absent proof of “undue hardship,” the following educational obligations are
considered nondischargeable student loans:
 A loan made, insured, or guaranteed by a governmental unit, or made
under any program, funded in whole or in part by a governmental unit
or nonprofit or for-profit institution
 An obligation to repay funds received as an educational benefit, scholar-
ship, or stipend
 Overpayments made on grants and other educational benefits
Nevertheless, not every education-related expense is protected from dis-
charge. Some courts have ruled that debts for things like books, supplies,
and student housing are dischargeable in bankruptcy. Another court may say
that Congress didn’t intend “to elevate any garden variety indebtedness that
a student may incur to an educational institution, be it cafeteria charges,
bookstore charges, parking lot charges, or room and board charges, to the
category of excepted educational debt.” So, getting to know the views of your
local bankruptcy judge is critical.
What if someone else lends you money to pay off your student loan? Is that
new debt dischargeable? It may very well be. A couple of courts have said
that a loan from an employer to pay off student loans is dischargeable. But
this stipulation isn’t an invitation to borrow money to pay student loans
while intending to bankrupt the new loan. As we discuss at length in
Chapters 13 and 16, borrowing money without intending to repay it is fraud,
and claims of fraud aren’t dischargeable.
Proving your insufferable need for a break
If you want to discharge a student loan in bankruptcy because repayment
would impose an undue hardship on you or your family, you have to con-
vince the judge of each of the following:
260
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

 You can’t maintain a minimal standard of living for you and your family if
you’re forced to repay the student loan.
 Your situation is likely to continue.
 You’ve made a good-faith effort to repay the loan.
Here’s a closer look at these requirements.
Defining financial hardship
Although you needn’t be poverty-stricken to satisfy this requirement, you do
have to be pretty severely strapped. One court ruled that a household
income of about $45,000 can provide a family of five with more than a mini-
mum living standard, and, as a result, the debtor was able to pay at least $175
per month on student loans.
When determining undue hardship, most courts consider all household
income and household expenses. But beware. Many courts won’t consider
the household expenses for a live-in lover or his children if you have no legal
obligation to support them.
Determining whether repayment imposes an undue hardship raises the ques-
tion of how long a person is expected to pay. Some courts look to the original
term of the loan, frequently ten years, to assess whether a debtor can repay a
loan over that period of time. But others adopt a much stricter view, saying
that debtors need to be required to pay on student loans for up to 25 years
and, if that’s possible, the loan isn’t discharged.
Courts don’t just look at how much money you’re earning right now; they
also look at how much you could earn in the foreseeable future if you put
your mind to it.
Forecasting that your circumstances are unlikely to improve
In addition to proving your inability to pay the loan, you must also show that
your financial plight is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. Temporary
hardship isn’t enough.
261
Chapter 18: Student Loans and Other Mind Games
Noble intentions aren’t enough
Mary chose to use her costly law degree to rep-
resent indigent clients who were unable to pay
her legal fees. Consequently, she couldn’t afford
to pay off her student loans. Is bankruptcy the
answer?
As noble as Mary’s efforts were, the court
wasn’t willing to cut her any slack on her stu-
dent loans. The judge flatly rejected Mary’s
argument that she couldn’t afford to repay her
loans because she was supporting a 20-year-
old daughter attending college.

This requirement can be met when the debtor suffers from a permanent
physical or mental disability or disease. Several courts ruled that a bipolar
condition (manic-depression) qualifies, and at least one concluded that
chronic fatigue syndrome is a permanent disability. But not all judges are
receptive to claims of mental illness.
Although the fact that the education was worthless doesn’t by itself justify
discharging the loan, it may be taken into consideration when determining
whether a debtor’s financial plight is likely to improve.
Demonstrating good faith
The third prong of the hardship test requires proof that you acted in good
faith regarding your student loans. Essentially, that means you
 Made all reasonable efforts to maximize income and reduce expenses
 Didn’t file bankruptcy solely to evade student loans
 Tried nonbankruptcy alternatives
 Made some effort, if at all possible, to repay the loans
Good faith is one of those eye-of-the-beholder concepts, and, in bankruptcy,
the judge has the beholding eye.
Wiping out part of your student loans
Even if they won’t discharge your entire student loan, some judges will elimi-
nate part of the burden and force the creditor to accept a repayment plan.
For example, courts have
262
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 
Choosing underemployment doesn’t cut it
Edwin had a master’s degree from Oxford but
gave up teaching because of stress and started
a pottery business, earning him less than $7,000
per year. The court said that a person can’t
qualify for discharge of student loan by volun-
tarily choosing to be underemployed and adopt-
ing a minimalist lifestyle.
Similarly, one court refused to discharge a
$19,121 student loan because the debtor, who
was a teacher, could earn more if she chose to
work during the summertime.

 Examined the debtors’ budget, determined that the debtor can afford to
pay $10 per month, and discharged the balance of the loan
 Reduced a Chapter 7 debtors’ student loans by more than 50 percent
and instructed the parties to propose a schedule for repaying the bal-
ance within six years
 Deferred collection for a period of one year
 Ruled that repayment of the principal balance would not impose undue
hardship, but discharged attorney fees and interest, and ordered the
creditor to accept a repayment plan of $50 per month
 Held that repayment of the total balance of several student loans
imposed undue hardship and discharged all but about one-fifth of the
total balance, reducing each loan proportionately
Other judges, however, find nothing in the Bankruptcy Code that would
empower them to partially discharge or restructure student loans. In their
view, discharge is an all-or-nothing proposition. From your standpoint, that’s
a double-edged sword. Courts that do not feel free to reduce or restore a loan
are often inclined to just wipe out the whole thing.
A few courts say that although student loans may not be restructured, each
loan can be considered separately so that one or two of a person’s student
loans can be wiped out while and the others are preserved. If your local court
takes this approach, consolidating all your loans before bankruptcy may be a
mistake because doing so can eliminate the possibility of discharging one of
your more costly loans. After all, consolidation combines all existing loans
into a single loan.
Paying student loans under a 
Chapter 13 plan
Although student loans can’t be wiped out in a Chapter 7 or a Chapter 13,
absent proof of “undue hardship,” you still can force the student loan creditor
to accept payments in amounts you can afford to make through a Chapter 13
repayment plan. However, you need to remember that if the loan isn’t paid in
full during the Chapter 13, you still must pay the balance when your case is
over, and interest on the loan balance continues to accrue during the bank-
ruptcy. So, even if you pay the balance of a student loan in full under a Chapter
13 plan, you’re still going to owe some interest after your case is complete.
263
Chapter 18: Student Loans and Other Mind Games

If the remaining term of the student loan is longer than the life of your
Chapter 13 plan, you can propose making up all the missed payments on the
student loan over the life of your plan and resume regular monthly payments
as they come due after the petition date. Of course, the balance remaining
when your Chapter 13 is completed still has to be paid. A number of courts
have endorsed this approach. One court points out that merely resuming reg-
ular payments on a student loan is okay, but paying off the entire debt under
the plan improperly discriminates in favor of the student loan.
A downside to curing a student loan and maintaining payments as a long-
term debt stems from the fact that long-term debt is excepted from discharge
in a Chapter 13 without regard to whether repayment imposes undue hard-
ship. By choosing to treat the loan in this fashion, you may lose the right to
claim that it should be discharged on undue-hardship grounds.
Using a “Chapter 20” strategy
One way around the rule forbidding Chapter 13 plans from discriminating in
favor of student loans is colloquially known as Chapter 20 bankruptcy (filing
Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 in succession).
264
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 
Judges’ ideas of good/bad faith
Case law provides some guidance into what
judges are likely to accept, or not accept, as a
good-faith argument:
When Joanne tried getting out of her student
loans by filing bankruptcy right after graduation,
the court not only refused to wipe out the loans,
but also scolded her for abusing the bankruptcy
process.
Ruby, a single mom living with her mother in
public housing, barely earned enough to get by.
Although she paid only $180 of $9,000 in student
loans, the court found that she acted in good
faith by paying as much as she could and wait-
ing for several years to file bankruptcy rather
than heading directly to bankruptcy court as
soon as her loans came due.
Mackenzie was able to discharge $100,000 in
student loans, part of which was for law school.
On the petition date, she was working as a law
clerk, earning $30,000, and her husband stayed
home to care for their children. Their monthly
income exceeded expenses by only $71. The
court agreed that Mackenzie’s husband proba-
bly couldn’t earn enough to offset child-care
expenses and concluded that the situation was
likely to continue for six years, when the
youngest child would be in school full-time.
Finally, the court held that the good-faith test
was met even though no payments had been
made on the loans because Mackenzie was
doing her best to minimize expenses and had
found the best job available.

For this strategy to work, you first file a Chapter 7 to discharge all debts
other than the student loan, and then you file a Chapter 13 case where you
propose paying the entire student loan. No discrimination problem exists
because you now only have one debt left; the others were discharged in the
Chapter 7.
Some courts take a dim view of this strategy, but they’re more likely to go
along if you don’t file Chapter 13 until you first try working out a nonbank-
ruptcy repayment arrangement. Actually, you may get a better deal outside
bankruptcy. We cover these options in the “Managing Student Loans without
Bankruptcy” section, later in this chapter.
Addressing medical school loans
Loans under the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program and
repayment obligations under scholarships granted by the National Health
Services Corporation (NHSC) program are even more difficult to discharge in
bankruptcy than other student loans. A waiting period must be satisfied, and
a court must decide that requiring repayment would be unconscionable.
The waiting periods are seven years for HEAL loans and five years for NHSC
obligations. Both are measured from the date the obligation first became due
to the date of the bankruptcy discharge.
265
Chapter 18: Student Loans and Other Mind Games
Discharging student loans by stealth and ambush
We (and a number of courts) view one way of
getting out of student loans in a Chapter 13 as a
dirty trick. Although this ploy has worked in
some cases, we most certainly don’t endorse it.
Still, it is something to discuss with your lawyer
who knows the views of your local bankruptcy
judge. Here’s how it works:
A crafty lawyer sticks a provision in a Chap-
ter 13 plan essentially providing that court
approval of your plan constitutes a finding that
repayment of student loans imposes an undue
hardship and that, as such, the debt will be 
discharged. A copy of the proposed plan is for-
warded to the student-loan creditor. If the stu-
dent-loan creditor lodges no objection, and the
court approves the plan, voilà! The debt is
wiped out.
Keep in mind, however, that your victory here
may be Pyrrhic because you and your lawyer
may well end up getting fined. Many judges
aren’t at all amused by what they view as an
attempt to slip one past the court, and they often
react with a vengeance.
Other courts, however, are more tolerant
because they view the Chapter 13 as essentially
a bargaining process where the plan is simply
an offer to creditors. Under this view, fining a
debtor or his counsel for simply making an offer
to a student-loan creditor wouldn’t seem proper.

Here’s kind of a weird crinkle: The strict standards for discharging medical
school loans apply only to a person’s first bankruptcy. If he ends up having to
file a second time, dischargeability is determined according to the undue
hardship standards applicable to ordinary student loans. See the earlier dis-
cussion in the section “Proving your insufferable need for a break.”
Getting stuck even when you’re 
only a cosigner
Student loans aren’t dischargeable even if you’re only a cosigner. If you
cosigned for your child’s student loan, not only are you liable when he 
doesn’t pay, you probably can’t escape it by filing bankruptcy.
Clicking your clock into The Hardship Zone
Everyone’s financial situation fluctuates, so timing can be critical. When con-
sidering undue hardship, the court tries to predict your future income and
expenses, based on your current situation.
Obviously, asking the court to discharge the student loan is a question best
posed when your financial situation is at its bleakest. Some courts have even
allowed debtors to discharge student loans years after their bankruptcy case
had been closed.
Bankruptcy can affect only debts existing at the time you file. Debts arising
after bankruptcy aren’t covered by the bankruptcy discharge. So, replacing a
prebankruptcy student loan with a new consolidation loan (see “Consolidating
your loans,” a little later in this chapter) may undercut your bankruptcy
options because the new loan would arise after you filed.
Bottom line: Check with a bankruptcy lawyer before getting a consolidation
loan.
Managing Student Loans 
without Bankruptcy
If, after reading the earlier section entitled “Managing Student Loans with
Bankruptcy,” you’re thinking that bankruptcy doesn’t appear to be the
answer to your prayers, other options include loan consolidation, deferment,
forbearance, renewal of eligibility, and administrative discharge.
266
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Consolidating your loans
Consolidation actually is a misnomer because you don’t need to have more
than one loan to qualify. Two programs that may prove helpful to you are
 Direct Consolidated Loans, which come directly from the federal 
government
 Federal Family Education Loans, which, although guaranteed by the fed-
eral government, are made by private lenders
Through these programs, your loans are paid off, and a new, consolidated
loan is created. Monthly payments are based on family income.
Don’t confuse these special educational consolidation loans with ordinary
pitches from private lenders to consolidate loans by balance transfers or
cash advances on credit cards, which almost never are good ways to address
a student loan.
The upside is that the consolidated loan may well carry a lower interest rate
than the original loan(s), the monthly payment probably will be less, and the
time to repay probably will be extended. It sounds like a great deal if you qual-
ify: Old loans are eliminated, you’re immediately eligible for new educational
loans and grants, and you’re no longer subject to garnishments or other col-
lection efforts.
However, here are a few downsides to consider:
 If you think you’ll ever want to challenge one of your student loans in
court, consult with an attorney before you agree to any form of consoli-
dation. A closed bankruptcy can be reopened to discharge a student
loan if your financial condition worsens. You may give up that option
whenever you obtain a consolidation loan after bankruptcy.
 Be aware that the consolidated loan carries an 18.5 percent collection
fee, which is added to the loan principal after consolidation. Ouch, that
hurts!
 If you’ve defaulted on any of your student loans, your credit report con-
tinues to reflect the fact that you were, at some point, in default, even
when you consolidate the loan.
 As always, realize that extending your payments increases the total
amount you have to pay, just as it does with a car loan or a home 
mortgage.
In almost every instance, the Federal Direct Consolidation loan is a better
deal than a FFEL consolidation loan because Federal Direct loans
267
Chapter 18: Student Loans and Other Mind Games

 Don’t have the FFEL requirement that you must make three payments to
qualify.
 Offer lower interest rates and payments. (In fact, payments can be zero
for families living at or below the poverty line. After 25 years, the
remaining balance is wiped out.)
 May be easier to postpone if someday you need a deferment.
After obtaining either type of loan, the borrower is eligible for new loans, and
no longer is subject to tax intercepts, garnishments, or other collections
efforts.
Only you, and perhaps your attorney, can decide whether consolidation is
the appropriate route. If you think it may be, you can obtain a loan applica-
tion and fact sheet by calling 800-557-7392. You can also download forms 
from the Department of Education Web site, www.ed.gov/DirectLoan/
consolid2.html.
Spouses need to avoid combining their individual loans into a single consoli-
dation loan; otherwise, each spouse becomes legally responsible for the
other’s student loans.
Requesting a reasonable and 
affordable payment plan
As an alternative to consolidation loans, you can request “a reasonable and
affordable” payment plan and renew your eligibility (so that you qualify for
more student loans) or rehabilitate your loans (so that your name is removed
from the creditor’s deadbeat list).
Guarantee agencies or collectors for the federal government are required to
offer this type of payment plan, but only when you specifically request it by
using the magic words: “renew eligibility” and/or “rehabilitate the loans.”
When you make six consecutive payments under such a plan, you renew your
eligibility for student loans. When you make 12 consecutive payments, you
can request that the loan be rehabilitated. In that case, the loan is essentially
rewritten. The disadvantage of rehabilitation is that the amount of your pay-
ments almost surely increases.
Guarantee agencies have authority to settle for less than the full amount of
the loan by waiving collection fees and agreeing to a discount of up to 30 per-
cent in exchange for a lump sum payment. Before agreeing to a compromise,
however, you need to confirm that the Department of Education recognizes
the deal and won’t later try to collect the balance.
268
Part IV: Getting Rid of (Most of) Your Debt 

Getting a deferment
Depending on what type of loan you have and when the loan was made, many
different grounds exist for justifying deferment of your loan. The most
common grounds are that you’re still in school, have lost your job, or are suf-
fering economic hardship. Contact the holder of your loan to determine
whether you may be eligible.
The nice thing about deferments is that you remain eligible for additional stu-
dent aid and you won’t be subjected to collection activity. The problem is
that you’re not eligible for a deferment if your loan is in default. Just the
same, you can reestablish the right to deferment by renewing eligibility or
getting a consolidation loan.
Accepting a forbearance
If you don’t qualify for a deferment, the holder of your loan may still agree 
to a forbearance, which temporarily suspends your payment obligation.
Forbearances are easier to obtain than deferments, but they aren’t as good. If
the loan is in default, you can still obtain a forbearance and stop collection
activity. However, interest continues to accrue. You can also obtain a forbear-
ance to prevent a loan from going into default, thereby preserving the right to
a deferment at some point in the future. As is true for a deferment, contact
the holder of your loan to find out whether you qualify.

N
ow that you’ve filed for bankruptcy, or decided to
file, you need to know how to function in this brave
new world — especially in the age of BARF. Even a little
misstep in BARF can send you down a slippery slope. But
this part tells you how to sidestep the slush and generally
explains how to avoid ticking off the trustee assigned to
your case and how to live comfortably and happily within
the confines of a Chapter 13 repayment plan. 

Chapter 19
Avoiding Troubles 
with Your Trustee
In This Chapter
 Protecting your fresh start by telling the truth and not playing games
 Appreciating how fraudulent transfers can cause you grief
 Anticipating situations where your bankruptcy can affect friends and relatives
C
reditors can usually get only the benefit of those assets deemed property
of the estate — which includes not only stuff you own on the petition
date, but also property you’ve transferred just prior to filing bankruptcy (see
Chapter 9 for more about transferring assets). Under certain circumstances,
the bankruptcy trustee can grab property that you transferred and sell it for
the benefit of your creditors.
In this chapter, we tell you some things that you shouldn’t do before filing
bankruptcy, if at all possible. If you’ve already done something that we talk
about here, your lawyer probably can fix the problem — but only if she
knows that the problem exists. You can find yourself in an awful mess when
you file bankruptcy if you don’t appreciate the trustee’s ability to retrieve
assets that you’ve transferred prior to bankruptcy, or if you haven’t been
completely honest and forthright with your lawyer.
Playing by the Rules and 
Telling the Truth
Quite simply, playing it straight is the best way to avoid headaches when
filing bankruptcy. When you don’t, the law arms the trustee with some pretty
potent weapons, and you really don’t want to stare down the barrel of that
gun. Trust us on this one.

Making sure that you play by the rules and that any assets that can and
should go to creditors actually do go to creditors is the trustee’s job. If you
gave your kayak to your buddy right before bankruptcy just to ensure that
the credit-card company wouldn’t get it, the trustee can go after your pal for
the return of the boat or payment of its value. Furthermore, and much more
painfully for you, if the trustee in a Chapter 7 liquidation case thinks you’re
jerking your creditors around, she can ask the court to deny your discharge
outright. When that happens, filing bankruptcy was for naught, because
 All your nonexempt property has been surrendered
 A bankruptcy is on your record
 None of your debts are eliminated
 You have no chance to eliminate those obligations through a Chapter 7
bankruptcy
In short, it’s a lose-lose-lose-lose situation.
By now you’re probably asking how you can avoid that headache.
The answer is real simple: Tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth. Your parents were right; honesty is the best policy. And not only does
truthfulness make you feel good, it may also keep you on the better side of
prison bars.

Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 
Debtor too smart for her own good
Joan thought she was being clever. She trans-
ferred her vacation house to her daughter but
didn’t bother telling her lawyer about the trans-
action and conveniently neglected to mention it
in her bankruptcy papers. Who would know?
Anyone who wants to, that’s who.
A creditor discovered Joan’s little maneuver in
public records and brought it to the court’s
attention. Joan’s daughter had to transfer the
house to the bankruptcy trustee, none of Joan’s
debts were wiped out, and she barely escaped
going to jail.
If Joan had been upfront with her lawyer from
the get-go, a far better strategy could have been
developed. For example, she may have been
advised to sell the vacation house for a fair
price and use the proceeds to fix the roof on her
primary home and catch up with back mortgage
payments.

Most documents filed in bankruptcy must be signed under penalty of perjury.
If you intentionally lie on bankruptcy documents, or at the 341 meeting with
creditors, you’ve committed perjury — a crime that can land you in prison.
Careless disregard for the truthfulness of your statements is the same as
lying, so ignorance is not bliss.
Accurately Listing Your Assets
If avoiding criminal prosecution and protecting your discharge isn’t enough
to keep you on the straight and narrow, there’s another reason to list all your
assets. If you accurately describe an asset and the trustee doesn’t sell it
while the case is open, that asset is abandoned — meaning it’s yours again
when the case is closed. Conversely, whenever you omit an asset or don’t
accurately describe it, your case can be reopened, even years later, with a
trustee demanding that you turn over the asset or pay for its value.
In addition, whenever you accurately describe an asset and claim it as
exempt in your bankruptcy schedules, the trustee and creditors have only 30
days after the 341 meeting to object. If no timely objection is filed, the prop-
erty is deemed exempt even though a court would have ruled otherwise had
a timely objection been filed.
Sometimes debtors forget to list a pending or potential lawsuit they have
against someone (from which they hope to gain some money). Forgetting can
prove to be a problem, especially when the debtor remembers the lawsuit
after the bankruptcy is closed and tries to pursue the claim. If the party
defending the claim is on the ball and discovers that you didn’t list the claim,
she may be able to have your suit dismissed.
Appreciating the Trustee’s Ability 
to Recover Assets
The bankruptcy trustee has powers designed to help her recover assets and
distribute proceeds fairly to unsecured creditors. Although powers wielded
by Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 trustees are similar, they’re most commonly
invoked in Chapter 7 cases.
275
Chapter 19: Avoiding Troubles with Your Trustee

These powers include recovering concealed assets and avoiding or undoing
 Fraudulent transfers
 Preferential transfers
 Unperfected liens
Fraudulent transfers
A transfer can be deemed a fraudulent transfer even when no actual fraud is
involved. The law distinguishes between transfers that reek so bad that they
are “actually fraudulent,” and those that are only technically fraudulent. A
transfer that wasn’t necessarily intentionally fraudulent, but was so far out of
line that it may as well have been intentional is called a constructively fraudu-
lent transfer.
Actually fraudulent transfers
When you’re buried in debt, your first impulse may be to give away your valu-
able property to friends or relatives so that creditors can’t get it. That’s an
actually fraudulent transfer, and it’s cheating. If you transfer the property
within the year before filing bankruptcy, your Chapter 7 discharge may be
denied — leaving you in worse financial trouble than when you started.
276
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 
Debtor loses homestead by trying to save it
Sneaky Pete owned his $75,000 Boston home
free and clear, but he was buried in debt and
afraid that his many creditors would go after the
house. So, Pete gave the house to his mother and
then filed a do-it-yourself bankruptcy, figuring his
creditors couldn’t take what wasn’t his.
Pete was wrong. Very wrong.
When the trustee learned of Pete’s stunt, she
went on the warpath. The trustee sued Pete’s
mom, recovered the home, and sold it. Adding
insult to injury, the trustee convinced the bank-
ruptcy court to deny Pete’s discharge. So, in the
end, Pete lost the house he was finagling to
save and still was up to his eyeballs in debt.
Pete’s first (and very costly) mistake was
attempting to handle his own bankruptcy. That’s
often about as sensible as a do-it-yourself
appendectomy. Any lawyer worthy of her
license would have told Pete that under
Massachusetts law, Pete’s home already was
exempt in bankruptcy, provided that he owned it
when he filed. So, Pete had no reason to trans-
fer the house to his mother. Furthermore, if he
already had given Mom the deed, the lawyer
would’ve told him to get it back before filing
bankruptcy. That way, Pete would keep his
home, have his debts discharged, and avoid the
embarrassment and indignity of getting his
mother sued.

Your discharge may be denied even when the actual transfer was more than
one year before bankruptcy, if you retained a secret ownership interest in the
property within the year before you filed for bankruptcy. Say, for example,
that three years before filing bankruptcy, you transferred title to your house
to your friend with the “understanding” that you still really owned the prop-
erty. In that situation, many courts apply a doctrine known as continuing con-
cealment to deny your discharge because, within the year preceding
bankruptcy, you concealed the fact that your really owned the property.
Whenever you try to conceal transfers or property from your bankruptcy
trustee, you may end up in jail.
In addition to having your discharge denied, the trustee can also go after the
recipient of a fraudulent transfer to recover the transferred asset or its value.
And we’re not talking about transfers made just before bankruptcy. When
taking this route, the trustee can challenge transfers you made up to six
years before bankruptcy!
Constructively fraudulent transfers
In contrast to actually fraudulent transfers (see the previous section), con-
structively fraudulent transfers aren’t intentional schemes to shield property
from creditors. Instead, they involve gifts or legitimate transfers of assets for
values less than they’re actually worth. The problem, from the standpoint of
creditors, is that these kinds of transfers leave you with fewer assets. For
example, if you sell a $10,000 car for $10,000, you still have the same amount
of assets to use for paying creditors. You simply transformed the car into
another asset — cash. On the other hand, if you just gave the car away, you
would have less for creditors. Here are a couple more examples that may
help illustrate this rather counterintuitive concept.
 Bob gives his sister $10,000 to help her through a nasty divorce. This
is a constructively fraudulent transfer because Bob transferred valuable
assets ($10,000) that could theoretically have been used to pay his
debts, but didn’t receive anything in return. So, the bankruptcy trustee
sued Bob’s poor sister for $10,000. But at least Bob got his debts wiped
out because he didn’t intentionally try to stiff his creditors.
 Mary pays $5,600 on her sister’s credit card right before filing. The
court deemed the transfer constructively fraudulent because Mary
wasn’t getting anything for her $5,600 and ruled that the trustee could
get the money back from Mary’s sister or the credit-card company.
 Joe pays $100,000 to attend a fund-raising dinner with the President
of the United States shortly before filing bankruptcy. When Joe filed
bankruptcy, the court ordered the Republican National Committee to
turn the money over to the trustee because the court decided that Joe
received “less than reasonably equivalent value” for his investment.
277
Chapter 19: Avoiding Troubles with Your Trustee

Gambling losses present yet another conundrum. Trustees sometimes go
after gambling casinos to recover a debtor’s gambling losses for the benefit of
creditors. But courts usually accept the casino’s argument that a gambler
receives significant value when gambling — the prospect of winning.
Until recently, whenever a debtor donated to his church, the trustee could
retrieve that money for payment to creditors. The theory then was that no
matter how laudable a person’s motives, his creditors shouldn’t subsidize his
charitable impulses. That’s changed.
In 1998, powerful religious organizations pushed through the Religious
Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act, which protects good-faith
charitable contributions of up to 15 percent of a debtor’s gross income
during the year before filing bankruptcy, or more when greater amounts are
consistent with past practices of the debtor. However, if the bankruptcy court
is convinced that a debtor’s contributions are made for the purpose of short-
changing creditors, the money can be recovered, and the debtor can be
denied his discharge.
Preferential transfers
Congress considers it unfair for unsecured creditors to get paid on the eve of
bankruptcy when others are left holding the bag. As a result, Congress gave
bankruptcy trustees the power to recover these payments, which are called
preferential transfers, for the benefit of all creditors.
278

Finding out the hard way
Celeste talked her way into a 60-day jail term
and four-month home detention after lying to the
bankruptcy court and fraudulently concealing
assets — namely, artwork, furniture, and money
she was making on the sly through her off-the-
books escort service. Celeste now has a crimi-
nal record, and she owes $25,000 restitution to
her creditors.
George and Rose got into trouble with the bank-
ruptcy court for neglecting to list $200,000 worth
of marijuana in their bankruptcy schedules. The
court said that even though the illegal drugs 
had no value to creditors, they should’ve been
disclosed.
Betty had authority to draw on her mother’s
bank account. Because all the money belonged
to her mother, Betty didn’t list this account on
her bankruptcy papers. Later, an angry creditor
yelled “fraud” and asked the court to deny her
bankruptcy discharge. Ultimately, Betty pre-
vailed because the funds, in fact, belonged to
her mother, but her bankruptcy became much
more expensive and complicated than it would
have been had she revealed her situation to the
court and her attorney.
Moral of the story: Tell your lawyer about every
asset you own or control and let your attorney
decide how to use that information.

For example, if you paid your dentist $1,000 on an overdue bill a month
before bankruptcy, the trustee can get the money back from the dentist and
distribute it among all your creditors. For you, it’s a lose-lose situation. The
dentist won’t be happy about having to give up the money, and you’ll be out
$1,000 that you could have used for living expenses, car payments, or house
payments. Even worse, if you paid that money toward a nondischargeable
debt only to have the trustee retrieve it, you wasted the dough — and the
nondischargeable debt that you intended to pay is revived and continues to
haunt you after bankruptcy.
You need to understand the difference between preferential and fraudulent
transfers. Fraudulent transfers are cheating; preferential transfers aren’t.
Whenever you pay a legitimate debt, the payment may be preferential but not
fraudulent. The distinction is important because your discharge can be denied
for making a fraudulent transfer but not for a preferential transfer. The former
is malicious or sneaky, and the latter is essentially an accident or error in judg-
ment. Either can affect your bankruptcy, though in different ways.
Be aware that preferential transfers can be recovered only when they’re
made within a relatively short time before bankruptcy, usually 90 days.
However, when a transfer is made to an insider, the trustee may be able to
recover all the payments made during the entire year prior to bankruptcy.
Whether an individual qualifies as an insider is determined on a case-by-case
basis. Insiders generally include relatives and others with relationships close
enough to you to strongly influence your actions. If you’re still friends with
your ex-spouse, he or she may be considered an insider. If you’re bitter ene-
mies, probably not. A live-in lover is deemed an insider by some courts.

Chapter 19: Avoiding Troubles with Your Trustee
Poor planning brings an ugly surprise
Patti’s parents loaned her $20,000 to help get
creditors off her back. Although the loan pro-
vided temporary relief, Patti still was buried
deep in debt. A few months later, her parents
needed their money back. So, Patti used money
in her IRA to repay them. She filed bankruptcy
two months later.
The trustee forced Patti’s parents to cough up
the $20,000 for distribution to all her creditors. If
Patti had filed bankruptcy before withdrawing
the IRA, the trustee couldn’t have touched the
money. Then, she’d have been free, after bank-
ruptcy, to repay her parents if she chose.
Moral of story: Parents and relatives can wait.

Most courts say that in the case of a regular check, payment occurs when the
check actually clears; however, with a cashier’s check or money order, pay-
ment occurs when it is mailed to the creditor.
Payments on cosigned loans and joint debts
If the potential exists for a friend or relative to be left holding the bag for one
of your debts if you don’t pay it (for example, a joint debt or your friend
cosigned for you), you may be tempted to protect her by paying that debt
before bankruptcy. That’s usually a bad idea (see “Poor planning brings an
ugly surprise” anecdote), despite your good intentions.
For example, if your dad cosigns for your loan, he promises the lender that if
you don’t pay, he will. Say that before bankruptcy, you caught up on the back
payments on that loan. Because every payment you make to the lender also
reduces the amount of your father’s potential liability, the law also treats any
payment to the lender as a payment to your dad — even though he doesn’t
actually receive any money. So a trustee can go after your dad for the money
you paid to the lender during the entire year prior to bankruptcy because
your dad is an insider. If the cosigner wasn’t an insider, the trustee can
recover only the payments made during the 90 days before the bankruptcy.
Rather than making payments on joint or cosigned loans before bankruptcy,
explaining things to the other person and having her make the payments until
after you file bankruptcy is a better way to go. You can always reimburse her
later. Obviously, this situation may cause some hard feelings, but your lawyer
may be able to help you explain how this strategy is best for both of you.
Payments that aren’t preferences
The following payments aren’t considered preferences. and the trustee can’t
recover them:
 Small payments: Payments totaling less than $600 to any single creditor
during the relevant time period (usually 90 days before bankruptcy, but
one year for payments to insiders).
 Payments on secured debts: Payments for things such as your house or
car aren’t recoverable as preferences. You can and need to continue
making these payments if you intend to keep your house or vehicle.
 Payments for current expenses: Regular payments on bills that aren’t
overdue aren’t avoidable. For example, your rent payment for the cur-
rent month isn’t a preference. But if you paid back rent totaling more
than $600, it would be a preference.
 Payments of back alimony or child support. The trustee can’t recover
payments to an ex-spouse for back alimony or child support.
280
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

Unperfected liens
The law requires lienholders to perfect their liens, or warn people that some-
one other than you claims an interest in your property. That’s why mortgages
must be filed as part of the public record, and security interests in motor
vehicles are noted on the certificate of title.
If a lien isn’t perfected by the time a bankruptcy petition is filed, it’s too late
for the creditor. The trustee can take over the creditor’s interest in the asset.
For example, assume that you owe the bank $4,000 on a car worth $5,000, and
the amount of the car that you can claim as exempt (property that is usually
off-limits to creditors) is $1,500. Usually, your exemption covers any equity in
the car, so the bank would have its security interest (meaning it could take
the car if you don’t pay), and there’d be nothing left over for the trustee. If
you wanted to keep the car, you’d continue making the payments to the bank.
However, if it turns out that when the bank loaned you the money, it forgot to
have its lien on your car noted on the certificate of title, the trustee can take
over the bank’s security interest and sell your car. The trustee then can take
all the money that would have gone to the lender, and you’d be paid for the
amount of your exemption only if any money was left over.
Here’s another hurdle: The act of perfecting a lien also is considered a trans-
fer of property. So, if a lien isn’t perfected at the same time that the loan is
made, trying to perfect it later on creates an avoidable preference if the bor-
rower files bankruptcy within the preference period.
For example: The bank that made your car loan discovers that it failed to have
its security interest noted on the certificate of title when it made the loan. If
the bank tries to fix the error later by having its security interest added to the
certificate of title, that attempt would be an avoidable transfer — if, that is,
you file bankruptcy within 90 days of when the bank tried to fix its error.
Special problems with manufactured
homes
In many states, manufactured homes begin life as personal property, subject
to certificate of title laws. In other words, a security interest must be noted
on the certificate of title. Whether the unit remains personal property cov-
ered by a certificate of title or becomes real property covered by a mortgage
when it’s installed and affixed to land isn’t clear.
281
Chapter 19: Avoiding Troubles with Your Trustee

As you can see, manufactured housing can be very tricky, and even major
lending institutions sometimes mess up their paperwork in such a way that
their security interest isn’t properly perfected. Trustees know to watch for
these kinds of circumstances and closely examine financing documents.
When they’re not done right, the trustee can swoop in, and you can lose your
home.
Bottom line: Whenever you have a manufactured home, show all the financ-
ing documents to your lawyer so that she can determine whether the paper-
work is in order. If it isn’t, she then can try to have the lender fix it before you
file bankruptcy. But remember the wrinkle we point out — 90 days must pass
from the time that the paperwork is corrected until bankruptcy is filed.
Otherwise, the trustee can nullify the act of fixing the paperwork.
When the trustee eliminates a lien because it’s unperfected, new preference
issues crop up.
Remember that payments on secured loans aren’t avoidable preferences (see
“Payments that aren’t preferences,” earlier in this chapter), but payments on
unsecured loans may be? Well, whenever the trustee avoids a lien, the loan is
considered unsecured at the time, so all prebankruptcy payments to the
creditor within the relevant time period (a year or 90 days) become avoid-
able preferences.
Assume, for example, that your uncle cosigned your secured car loan and
during the past year you paid $1,500 on the loan. Ordinarily, these payments
wouldn’t be avoidable preferences because they were made to a secured
creditor.
But say that the bank forgets to note its security interest on the certificate of
title, which enables the trustee to avoid it. In that situation, all the loan pay-
ments become preferences, and the trustee can recover the money from your
uncle. What’s more, your uncle still is on the hook for the car loan because
the trustee is selling the car for the benefit of other creditors.
Protecting Your Discharge
Under BARF, minor missteps may jeopardize your discharge — preventing
your debts from being wiped out. Because debt elimination is probably the
main reason to file bankruptcy, be sure to check out Chapter 6 to make sure
that you jump through all the hoops.

Bankruptcy
In This Chapter
 Constructing a realistic plan
 Having a lawyer by your side
 Figuring out what to do if you blow it
 Dealing with car and mortgage payments outside the plan
 Addressing postpetition debts
 Getting lucky
W
hen preparing your Chapter 13 financial reorganization plan, you have
to gaze three to five years into the future, realistically calculate your
income and expenses, and promise to make regular payments based on those
guesstimates. Unless you have a pretty reliable crystal ball, or a resident
soothsayer, that’s an awfully tall order. Often, adjustments must be made
because of your mistakes or because something (like an unexpected medical
expense) happens to muck up your plan.
This chapter provides you with pointers for getting started on the right foot
with a plan that’s realistic and sensible. It addresses the importance of
having a lawyer who’s willing to stand by you from A to Z, describes your
options when your repayment plan implodes, and offers insights into the
potential successes and pitfalls that arise when things suddenly turn around
and a windfall comes your way. Finally, Table 20-1 at the end of this chapter
lists the various choices you can make whenever your plan isn’t working,
along with the implications of making those choices.
If you filed your Chapter 13 case prior to October 17, 2005, the effective date
of BARF, you don’t want your case dismissed. The old law, which was much
more sympathetic to debtors, continues to apply to your present case, even
if it’s converted to Chapter 7. But, if your case were dismissed, any new filing
would be subject to the harsh provisions of BARF.

Creating a Realistic Plan
Stuff happens — good things and bad. It’s no wonder that nationally less that
one-third of all Chapter 13 bankruptcies succeed. But your Chapter 13 needn’t
fail. With a reasonable plan, the odds of your success aren’t all that bad. In
fact, they’re pretty decent.
The key is remaining reasonable.
Face it. If your plan is so tight that macaroni and cheese becomes an extrava-
gant delicacy, it won’t work — at least not for long. On the other hand, if your
plan imposes reasonable restraint but enables you to maintain a satisfactory,
albeit disciplined, lifestyle, you have a good shot.
Although statistically most plans fail, the raw stats don’t tell the entire story
because they fail to take into account which plans were unreasonable and
therefore are virtually jinxed from the get-go, and which were reasonable and
therefore had a fighting chance.
The key: Don’t be discouraged by the theoretical odds. When your plan
makes sense, you’re probably going to come out of this situation just fine,
even with those little surprises that life tends to toss in your path.
Why Chapter 13 plans fail
A Chapter 13 reorganization usually fails for one (or more) of the following
reasons:
 It’s poorly designed, unrealistic, and doomed from day one.
 The debtor screws up and just won’t live within a budget.
 Unexpected expenses pop up.
 One of the first three listed items happens, and the debtor neglects to
advise his or her lawyer, who probably could have dealt with the prob-
lem before it got out of hand and before it was too late to deal with.
Avoid these pitfalls, and you’re home-free.
BARF sets up numerous booby traps to snare unsuspecting debtors. You may
be required to file additional materials with the court after your case is ini-
tially filed. For example, if the trustee or creditor so requests, any federal
income tax returns, including amendments that you file with the IRS while the
case is open must also be filed with the bankruptcy court. Additionally, in
Chapter 13, debtors must file annual reports showing all their income for the
previous year. If you forget to file this paperwork, your case can be dis-
missed. And you don’t want that to happen.
284
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

Paying the bare minimum
With a Chapter 13 plan, you can clear your slate of most debts by paying just
pennies on the dollars that you owe. Still, you usually must pay a threshold
minimum so that you obtain your fresh start. Typically, that minimum
amount is the total of
 Back payments on your mortgage (if you want to keep your home)
 Nondischargeable priority taxes
 Prepetition support obligations
 The value of any nonexempt assets
The total amount must be paid within 60 months, so any plan that’s designed
to last the full 60 months is precarious and suspect because it puts you right
up against the wall from the start and offers you no wiggle room if things don’t
work out just the way you hoped. If the math doesn’t add up under a 60-month
plan, you may be tempted to propose a schedule where monthly payments
start out relatively low but then increase in the latter stages of your plan. At
first blush, such plans sound doable, and maybe they are. But . . .
In our experience, we find it more often is a prescription for disaster. When
the time comes for plan payments to increase, the money inevitably just isn’t
there. Then, the Chapter 13 case is dismissed or converted to a Chapter 7 liq-
uidation, and any payments that you made are frequently for naught.
BARF will undoubtedly increase the percentage of Chapter 13 cases that fail —
especially for those with incomes greater than the Median Income for their
state. (See Chapter 5 for an explanation of Median Income.) This is because the
new law requires that above-median debtors sign on for a five-year plan rather
than the usual three unless creditors are paid 100 percent of their claims.
285
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy
Having payments deducted from your wages
If you want to, you can have your Chapter 13
payments automatically deducted from your pay
and forwarded to the trustee. Doing so is a con-
venient way to go that obviously makes squan-
dering the money much harder to do because
you never see it. You can do this by signing
what’s called a wage deduction order.
We have mixed thoughts about wage 
deductions.
Although some studies suggest that the suc-
cess rate is higher, experiencing financial dis-
cipline is part and parcel of the Chapter 13
process. Working with your plan is when it’s
time to take control of your finances, instead of
allowing others to do it for you. You certainly
won’t get any mileage out of burdening your
boss with special payroll procedures. It’s your
call, of course, but we recommend making the
payments yourself.

Keeping Your Lawyer in the Loop
Because the Bankruptcy Code doesn’t provide clear guidance for dealing with
the unexpected — job losses, unforeseen medical expenses, and so on —
judges and trustees have had to improvise. They’re usually pretty reason-
able, but absent any formal direction, they more or less fashion their own
rules and practices.
What’s kosher in some areas is taboo in others, so having a guide who really
knows the local practices, preferences, and eccentricities truly helps.
A Chapter 13 plan has a much better chance of succeeding when your lawyer
sticks with you through the entire case — not just until your plan is confirmed.
Your lawyer needs to be willing to bargain with the Chapter 13 trustee when-
ever circumstances change. A lawyer who stands by you for three to five
years obviously expects to be paid, but that shouldn’t be a big problem.
Legal fees are usually covered in regular plan payments.
Blowing It . . . Again? Not!
Sometimes, even the best Chapter 13 plan falls through because you lose
your job, get sick, or you’re unable to make payments as a result of other
unforeseen events. All isn’t necessarily lost. Depending on the type of debts
and payments you’re facing, your options include
 Suspending your payments
 Modifying your plan
 Requesting a hardship discharge
 Converting your case to a Chapter 7 liquidation
 Dismissing your case outright
 Dismissing your case and then filing a Chapter 7
 Dismissing your case and then filing a second Chapter 13 reorganization
Considering each of these options is enough to make your head spin. Table
20-1, at the end of this chapter, provides a thumbnail sketch (granted, a very
large thumbnail sketch) of what you have to think about. You may want to
glance at this table right now just to get a general overview and then refer
back to it as you read through this chapter.
286
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

Whenever you miss payments to the trustee — and don’t take advantage of
any of the options in the previous bulleted list — the court dismisses your
case, enabling creditors to resume collection efforts against you and your
property. Furthermore, you may be barred from filing another bankruptcy for
180 days — regardless of how bad things get.
Something called the 180-day rule forbids a second bankruptcy within — you
guessed it — 180 days of dismissal of an earlier case. The rule kicks in if the
dismissal was
 Requested by you after a creditor asked the court for permission to fore-
close (which is called a motion for relief from stay)
 Resulted because you intentionally failed to comply with a court order
When a previous Chapter 13 case was dismissed because you couldn’t make
plan payments, some courts would rule that the 180-day doesn’t apply.
Reason: Inability to make payments is not an intentional disregard of a court
order. On the other hand, some courts forbid a refiling, and 180 days is
enough time for an aggressive mortgage holder to foreclose on your house.
Even if the 180-day rule doesn’t apply, you may not get the benefit of the
automatic stay in a second case filed within one year of dismissal.
If you had one bankruptcy dismissed less than one year before filing a new
bankruptcy, the automatic stay kicks in when the new case is filed, but it
expires in 30 days unless you persuade the court that the stay should remain
in effect.
If more than one bankruptcy was dismissed within this one-year period, there
is no automatic stay in the new case. You have to file a special request for the
court to impose the stay.
The only exception is where your Chapter 7 case was dismissed for flunking
the Means Test, and you’re now filing Chapter 13. (See Chapter 5 for an expla-
nation of the Means Test.)
You may wonder what you have to do to convince a judge to resurrect the
stay if you have to refile within one year of dismissal. Good question.
With BARF, if your case was dismissed for failing to file documents, you must
show a “substantial excuse” — not just negligence or inadvertence. “My dog
ate my homework” probably doesn’t cut it. If your earlier case was dismissed
because you couldn’t keep up with your plan payments, you have to prove
that circumstances have changed, and now you’re able to make payments.
Undoubtedly, your chances of success hinge on the attitudes and prejudices
of local bankruptcy judges, which can be wildly divergent.
287
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

And even if you are eligible to file, if you file within one year of dismissal, you
don’t get the benefit of the automatic stay (which stops all collection efforts
and lawsuits —a big, big benefit of bankruptcy) unless you convince the bank-
ruptcy court that dismissal was due to conditions beyond your control and
that your financial condition has changed since the dismissal. (See Chapter 6
for more insight.)
Suspending your payments
If you miss payments because of a temporary crisis — say you get laid off or
sick — the wise thing to do is to ask the trustee to allow you to suspend pay-
ments until the crisis subsides. In that situation, the suspended payments
aren’t forgiven; they’re just paid later, and the time limit of the plan is
extended.
As long as you have a good reason for suspending payments and can con-
vince the trustee that your problem is only temporary, you’ll probably be
allowed some latitude.
But there’s a hitch.
Because a Chapter 13 can’t run any longer than 60 months, if your plan
already is five years old, suspending payments and extending the life of your
plan won’t work. In that case, the plan must be modified, which can raise an
entirely new set of problems (see the next section). This reason is just one of
several why a 60-month repayment plan is inherently dicey. Quite simply, not
much room is left for error.
If your income exceeds the median for your state, suspending payments
probably won’t work because your plan is probably already at 60 months.
Modifying your plan
When a suspension of payments won’t work — because the change in your
circumstances isn’t temporary or because your plan already is 60 months
long — it may be possible to modify your Chapter 13 plan. Doing so usually
results in lower payments now and higher ones in the future.
Consider the case of Fred and Frederica. The Chapter 13 repayment plan was
working just great. Fred and Frederica were diligently making up the missed
mortgage payments and, finally, could see some light at the end of the tunnel.
Then, their teenage son fractured his skull in a car crash, and they had to use
the mortgage money to pay doctor bills. The bank asked for bankruptcy
court permission to foreclose on their house.
288
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

Fred and Frederica quickly called their lawyer, who immediately filed a modi-
fied Chapter 13 plan. The plan, accepted by the court, extended the previous
schedule and established payments that Fred and Frederica could make.
They kept their house. And their son is doing just fine, thank you.
Modification can solve your problem the same way it did for Fred and
Frederica. Of course, any proposed modification must be feasible, so the
court examines your situation to see whether it’s likely you’ll be able to make
higher payments at a later date. In other words, a judge isn’t going to cut you
a break now unless he’s pretty sure you’ll be able to make good on it later. If
you can’t afford higher future payments under a modified plan, consider
asking the court for a hardship discharge (see the next section).
Modifying a plan after confirmation may open a Pandora’s box.
Remember that any Chapter 13 plan must propose to pay the value of your
nonexempt property based on the value of the property when the plan is 
confirmed.
If the value of your nonexempt property increases and you ask to have a
modified plan confirmed, the court may insist on payments based on the
increase in value. That kind of a result certainly isn’t a good one, especially
when you’re already having problems keeping up with payments. All courts
don’t see things that way, but changing property values is something you
need to discuss with your lawyer before requesting a plan modification.
For example, when your plan was initially confirmed, the equity in your home
was within the allowable exemption. But after a couple of years, when you
request a plan modification, the increase in your equity may exceed the
exemption because of an appreciation in value or simply a reduction of the
mortgage balance. In this situation, some courts bump up your payments to
cover the increased equity.
Requesting a “hardship discharge”
A hardship discharge stops the Chapter 13 dead and excuses all remaining
payments. To understand how it works, look at what happened to Isaac.
Isaac filed a Chapter 7 six years ago, and lo and behold, is in trouble again,
with $10,000 in new credit-card bills. Because Isaac’s bankruptcy was less
than eight years ago, a Chapter 7 won’t wipe out his debts, so he tries to
make payments under a Chapter 13, but no dice. He just can’t keep up. So,
Isaac’s attorney convinced the court to award a hardship discharge. Once
again, his slate is squeaky clean.
289
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

Good deal, huh?
To qualify for such a discharge, you must
 Convince the court that your inability to make payments is for reasons
beyond your control
 Show that modification of the plan isn’t feasible
 Already have made payments equal to the value of any nonexempt prop-
erty you had on the petition date
The major disadvantage of a hardship discharge is that you don’t obtain the
usual super discharge provided in Chapter 13 cases. We explain in Part IV
how some debts may be wiped out in a Chapter 13 but not in a Chapter 7.
That’s why a Chapter 13 discharge is called a super discharge (although it’s
not all that super any more under BARF). But you obtain a super discharge
only if you complete all your plan payments. In a hardship discharge, the
only debts that are wiped out are the ones that are eliminated in a Chapter 7.
Nonetheless, a hardship discharge has the following advantages over con-
verting the case to a Chapter 7:
 If you received a discharge in a bankruptcy filed within eight years
(unless the prior bankruptcy was a Chapter 13 and creditors were paid
at least 70 percent of their claims) of your present Chapter 13, your
debts are not wiped out if you convert to Chapter 7. In contrast, you can
wipe out your debts with a Chapter 13 hardship discharge if the earlier
bankruptcy was a Chapter 7, 11, or 12 case filed more than four years
before your present case, or a Chapter 13 case filed more than two years
before your present case.
 The property you owned when your Chapter 13 was filed isn’t reexam-
ined the way it would be if you convert the case to a Chapter 7. This
issue can be an especially important issue if, for example, you move out
of your home (which had qualified for a homestead exemption) or the
law governing exemptions was altered. On the other hand, if you convert
to a Chapter 7, the court can apply the new rules, and your property
may no longer be exempt. If you go the hardship discharge route, prop-
erty that was exempt when you initially filed bankruptcy remains
exempt despite changes of this kind.
Converting to a Chapter 7
Although a hardship discharge is frequently a better deal than converting
your case to a Chapter 7, it may not be an option. Some courts interpret the
“hardship” in hardship discharge strictly and literally, reserving it for debtors
who have suffered some catastrophic disaster. Your lawyer should know
whether your judge takes this view.
290
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

Conversion does have one advantage over a hardship discharge, however. If
you convert, you gain relief from debts arising after your Chapter 13 petition
was filed that wouldn’t be included in a hardship discharge. For example, if
you incurred some new bills after filing a Chapter 13, they ordinarily won’t be
wiped out in your existing bankruptcy; however, if you convert to a Chapter 7,
you can add these debts to the ones you can eliminate.
With BARF, it’s not clear whether a person who was not initially eligible for
Chapter 7 because of the Means Test can come in through the back door by
first filing Chapter 13 and then converting to Chapter 7. Our guess is that
courts won’t automatically allow this tactic, especially if this was your plan
from the beginning. But they may go along if you did your best to make the
Chapter 13 work, but just couldn’t cut it.
Dismissing your Chapter 13 and 
filing a new Chapter 7
Instead of converting your Chapter 13 to Chapter 7, you can dismiss your
Chapter 13 bankruptcy and file a brand new one under Chapter 7. Choosing
between these two alternatives can be devilishly complicated.
The advantages of filing a new Chapter 7 over converting an existing case to a
Chapter 7 are
 Beneficial changes in the law apply in a new case.
 You can delay filing a new case so that any debts incurred on the eve of
the first case aren’t presumed to be fraudulent. See Chapters 13 and 14
for an explanation of why debts incurred on the eve of bankruptcy may
not be discharged.
 You may be able to sell assets that you’d lose in a Chapter 7 and use the
money for living expenses. Chapter 10 contains more info on turning
nonexempt assets into exempt assets. Chapters 7 and 19 provide more
food for thought on the subject of selling assets prior to bankruptcy.
 You can reestablish your homestead exemption if you’ve changed your
residence during the Chapter 13 case. We explore this option a in the sec-
tion entitled “Requesting a ‘hardship discharge,’” earlier in this chapter.
 If you dismiss your Chapter 13 and then file a new Chapter 7, you retain
an option to convert the Chapter 7 into a Chapter 13 filing. When you
convert to a Chapter 7, you can’t convert back to a Chapter 13.
291
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

The disadvantages of filing a new Chapter 7 over converting an existing case
to a Chapter 7 are
 Attorney fees and costs will probably be higher.
 Unfavorable changes in the law will apply in a new case, but wouldn’t if
you converted an existing case.
 If your Chapter 13 was filed on or before October 17, 2005, your case is
not governed by BARF. You’re not subjected to the Means Test or other
burdens and indignities of the new law if you convert your case to
Chapter 7. But after your pre-October 17, 2005, case is dismissed, any
new filing will be.
 The automatic stay is not so “automatic” if you file within one year of
having a case dismissed. To get the benefit of the stay, you have to con-
vince the court that you had a good reason for dismissing your earlier
case and that your financial circumstances have changed since then. 
When a case is converted, courts disagree about whether exemptions are
determined as of the date of your Chapter 13 petition or the date that the
case was converted.

Pondering one fickle legal pickle
Nigel faithfully made all his Chapter 13 pay-
ments until the auto repair shop where he had
worked for 15 years cut its workforce. To make
ends meet, he got a job working nights in a con-
venience store and even moved into an apart-
ment above the store so that he could rent out
his house. When Nigel filed a Chapter 13, no one
objected to his assertion that the home was
exempt.
Nigel’s convenience store boss, Garfield, filed a
Chapter 13 at about the same time.
When he filed a Chapter 13, Garfield owned his
personal residence, which was exempted, and
a rental property, which wasn’t exempt. After
his income dropped, Garfield cut expenses by
moving into the smaller rental property and
allowing foreclosure to progress on his former
residence.
Neither Nigel nor Garfield can keep up with
their Chapter 13 payments, so the question
becomes one of whether Nigel’s and Garfield’s
homes are exempt if their Chapter 13 cases are
converted to Chapter 7 cases.
Most courts would say that Nigel’s house would
be exempt after the case converts to a Chapter
7 because it was exempt on the date he initially
filed under the Chapter 13. However, Garfield’s
house wouldn’t be exempt because it wasn’t his
residence on the Chapter 13 petition date, even
though it was when the case was converted.
But then again, other courts may rule just 
the opposite, saying that Nigel’s home wasn’t
exempt because he didn’t live there on the date
of conversion, but Garfield’s home was exempt
because that’s where he lived when his case
was converted.

In other words, your property may have qualified as a homestead when your
Chapter 13 was filed, but if you moved out of the property and then con-
verted to a Chapter 7, the property may no longer qualify as a homestead
and, as such, would go to the trustee.
Sounds complicated, doesn’t it? Well, it is . . . and it’s further complicated by
the fact that to some extent the rules that apply aren’t uniform or consistent
and are dependent on the way your local bankruptcy court does business.
Also, your property may have increased in value since you filed Chapter 13.
For example, when you filed under a Chapter 13 reorganization, say that your
homestead was worth $75,000 and subject to a $50,000 mortgage. Because
your state allows a homestead exemption of $25,000 at the time you filed,
your property was entirely exempt — no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
But when you converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation, the value of your prop-
erty had increased to $90,000, and the mortgage balance had dropped to
$47,000. As a result, your equity in the house is $43,000, a considerable
amount more than your state allows for an exemption. If your home is still
completely off-limits, you get the benefit of this increase in value. But some
courts would allow the Chapter 7 trustee to sell your home, pay you $25,000
for your exemption, and distribute the balance to creditors.
The answer’s a crapshoot because it depends on where you live and how
your bankruptcy court views converting to a Chapter 7 versus dismissing a
Chapter 13 and filing a new Chapter 7 case.
Kind of a bummer, isn’t it?
Dismissing your Chapter 13 and 
filing a new Chapter 13
Sometimes you’re better off dismissing your Chapter 13 and starting a new
Chapter 13 instead of trying to modify your existing Chapter 13 plan.
The advantages:
 You get a brand-new 60-month period to repay your debts. When you’re in
the fourth year of a five-year plan and problems develop, you have only
one year remaining to cure any problems. This way, a new Chapter 13
gives you another five years.
 You can include debts incurred since your original Chapter 13 filing.
293
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

The disadvantages:
 When your Chapter 13 is dismissed, you lose the benefit of cram-down
(restructuring the loan without needing the consent of the lender). Say,
for example, that your car is worth $5,000, and you owe $11,000. You
were keeping your car in Chapter 13 by cramming down, or paying its
value — $5,000 during the life of the plan (see Chapter 11). Dismissing
and filing a new Chapter 13 means having to pay for your $5,000 car all
over again because you receive no credit for payments made in your ear-
lier case.
 Whenever you file more than one Chapter 13, the court eyes all the cir-
cumstances very carefully to determine whether the second case is filed
in bad faith.
 The automatic stay isn’t “automatic” if the second case is filed within
one year of dismissal of the first.
Tackling Car and Mortgage Payments
Outside the Plan
Chapter 13 plans commonly provide that, in addition to payments to the
trustee, the debtor must continue making regular house and car payments
directly to the lenders for payments that come due after the date you file
bankruptcy (the petition date). These payments are deemed outside the plan.
Whenever you fall behind on outside-the-plan payments, the lender asks the
court for a relief from stay so that it can foreclose on your home or repossess
and sell your car.
At this point, your options are
 Doing nothing
 Proposing a modified plan that includes missed payments
 Working out a drop-dead agreement (See the upcoming section entitled,
“Working out drop-dead agreements.”)
 Asking for time to sell your property
Doing nothing
If your attorney doesn’t respond to a motion for relief from stay, the court
will probably grant the motion by default.
294
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

You choose this option only when you’re resigned to letting the property go.
Note: You’ll have to surrender your car immediately, but you can remain in
your home for a while.
How long you can stay in your home depends on whether foreclosure pro-
ceedings were underway when you filed bankruptcy. If they were, you may not
have much time because the mortgage company can simply resume foreclo-
sure proceedings where they left off. On the other hand, if the foreclosure isn’t
already pending, you have at least three months before you have to get out.
You also need to consider whether you have any reason to remain in your
Chapter 13 — especially when the only reason for filing bankruptcy was to save
your home. If that’s the case, you may be better off simply dismissing your
case, or if you have other debts, converting to a Chapter 7. Choosing to remain
in Chapter 13 after a creditor gets relief from the stay probably means that
you’ll have to modify your plan. Be sure to ask your lawyer about doing that.
Proposing a new plan that includes 
missed payments
If you still want to keep your house or car, the court may give you time to
make up additional missed payments by adding them to the amount you’re
already paying to the trustee.
When your plan calls for monthly $500 outside-the-plan payments on your
mortgage and you fall four payments behind ($2,000) with 24 months left on
your plan, you can propose an increase in your plan payment to the trustee
of about $90 per month to catch up on the missed postpetition payments.
This scenario is a feasible option only when the reason for missing postpeti-
tion payments was temporary, and you’re able to afford increased payments
to the trustee and resume regular payments to the lender.
You must also have enough time left under the plan to make up the missed pay-
ments. Remember that Chapter 13 plans can’t be more than 60 months long.
If you don’t have enough time left in your plan, you may consider dismissing
your Chapter 13 and filing a new one. Some of the pitfalls to this tactic are that
 When a creditor moves for relief from the stay, you can’t file a second
case for 180 days. This rule gives the mortgage lender enough time to
complete foreclosure if it acts quickly.
 The one-year no-automatic stay rule may apply.
 The bankruptcy court may enter an in rem order, which means that 
any bankruptcy filed in the foreseeable future won’t interfere with 
foreclosure.
295
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

Working out drop-dead agreements
Sometimes, a mortgage lender agrees to withdraw its challenge to the auto-
matic stay, provided that you agree that any further missed payments result
in virtually automatic foreclosure. This sword of Damocles is known as a
drop-dead agreement because if you blow it again, you’re “dead.” As chancy
as it sounds — and is — it may be your only option for keeping your home.
Ordinarily, your lawyer negotiates the terms of such an agreement, but you
need to pay close attention to make sure that everybody concurs on the date
by which payments must be made, the amount of the payments, and whether
payments are to be made directly to the creditor or to the trustee. Likewise,
you need to try to get the creditor to agree to give you notice and a short
time — ten days is reasonable — to make up any payment you accidentally
miss.
Asking for time to sell your property
Finally, your lawyer may respond to a motion for relief from stay by asking
the court to allow you a short time to sell the property and pay off the mort-
gage company. Doing so makes sense when you have substantial equity built
up in the property. Although you don’t get to keep the property, at least you
won’t lose your exemption.
For example, assume that your home is worth $100,000, and you owe $75,000
on the mortgage. Odds are that at a foreclosure sale, your mortgage holder
will end up owning the property, and you’ll get nothing. However, if you sell
the property yourself, you’d sell it for $100,000 — enough to pay off the mort-
gage holder and leave you with $25,000, less, of course, any commission you
have to pay to a real estate agent.
In some jurisdictions, Chapter 13 trustees claim that the $25,000 needs to be
turned over to them for distribution to unsecured creditors and, regrettably,
some judges agree. Your lawyer can fill you in on these local customs.
Addressing Debts Incurred After You File
When your budget is realistic and no unforeseen catastrophes occur after
confirmation of your Chapter 13 plan, you shouldn’t need any postpetition
credit. In fact, you’re not supposed to incur any postpetition debts without
permission from the trustee. As a practical matter, incurring a new debt is
occasionally necessary and sometimes even wise, but it’s so potentially per-
ilous that you never should do it without first consulting your attorney and
the trustee.
296
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

The implications of postpetition debt vary, depending on whether the debt 
is for
 Nonemergencies
 Emergencies
 An automobile
 Support obligations
 Income taxes
Nonemergencies
Whenever you find yourself in need of credit after filing your petition, you’ll
probably hear big-time warning bells going off. Before you rack up any new
debts, you need to figure out why your plan isn’t working. If your budget was
unrealistic, admit it and ask your lawyer about modifying your plan.
Otherwise, things are just going to get worse. Trust us.
Postpetition debts may be dischargeable when you convert to a Chapter 7 or
dismiss your Chapter 13 and file a new case, but if you incurred debts during
a Chapter 13 case and you didn’t tell the creditor that you were in bank-
ruptcy, that creditor has a pretty good argument that the amount it loaned
you should be excepted from discharge because of fraud.
Emergencies
True emergencies are different. If your wife got cancer and insurance covers
only a fraction of the cost of her treatment, if your company downsized and
you lose all your overtime hours, or if you live in Buffalo and your furnace
blows in mid-January, accommodations are in order.
When something that causes your bankruptcy plan to fail truly is beyond your
control, you can probably find a way to reasonably deal with it. But you need
to contact your lawyer as soon as you can, preferably before incurring any
expense. The Bankruptcy Code includes a procedure for obtaining trustee
approval and modifications to your plan that include emergency expenses. 
It’s in place to deal with just these sorts of things. If you need it, use it.
Automobiles
One of life’s certainties is that cars die, often when you need them most. So
what do you do when your car croaks while you’re in the middle of a Chap-
ter 13 bankruptcy?
297
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy

If you own the late, great car outright and don’t owe anything, you can proba-
bly go out and buy a new one, assuming that you have the cash, but be sure
to check with your lawyer first about local rules and customs. Financing the
new car isn’t so easy. You need to contact your lawyer, who will have to con-
vince the trustee and the judge that you can afford the payments and still live
within your budget.
If, on the other hand, the car that died was financed, you have another prob-
lem. The creditor who financed the now deceased car was promised certain
payments under your plan. Ideally, you can try modifying your plan, giving
back the car, and avoiding payment of the balance of the loan. Some courts
allow this kind of approach, but others will hold you to your original 
commitment. Again, you need to talk to your lawyer about this situation.
Support obligations
Nothing but trouble lies ahead when you start falling behind on support
obligations that come due after the petition date.
The support creditor — it can be an ex-spouse, child, or governmental sup-
port collection agency — may come after you without regard to your bank-
ruptcy. Even if a support creditor lets you slide, debts for postpetition
support must be paid up by the end of your Chapter 13 case, or you won’t get
a discharge
When your support payments are unreasonably high, the place to look for
relief is the state court, but beware. Figuring out how to pay a domestic rela-
tions lawyer is tricky because of restrictions on incurring postpetition debt.
Your bankruptcy lawyer will have to forge some sort of arrangement that is
acceptable to the trustee and the divorce lawyer. The specifics depend on the
practices adopted in your locality.
Income taxes
Bankruptcy laws do not suspend your obligation to pay income taxes that
accrue after filing your Chapter 13 petition. You need to pay them the same
as if you hadn’t filed bankruptcy.
Ideally, your employer withholds enough from your paycheck so that you
won’t owe additional taxes. However, consumers often are hit with unex-
pected tax bills on April 15, and the temptation to ignore that obligation is
great because you’re already on a tight budget. That’s the worst thing to do.
Call your lawyer instead.
298
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 

The lesson: Make sure that you carefully consider the possibility of postpeti-
tion income taxes before filing for bankruptcy. And if an unexpected tax liabil-
ity pops up after you file, call your lawyer immediately.
Aside from paying the tax, you must file all income tax returns that come due
after the petition date or get an extension of time from the taxing authority.
And remember to file a copy of your federal return with a court. Otherwise,
your case can be dismissed.
Sinking Your Ship before It Arrives
Sometimes a person’s financial condition improves instead of falling apart.
Funny thing, an arriving ship still may result in bad news when it isn’t han-
dled properly. Look what happened to Mary, for example.
299
Chapter 20: Living on the Edge in Chapter 13 Bankruptcy
Thoughtless revenuer creates problems 
for everyone
Joe thought he had it made in the shade.
He faithfully made all his Chapter 13 payments
for four and one-half years and looked forward
to his discharge in only a few months. Then dis-
aster struck. A tax collector filed a proof of
claim for postpetition income taxes that added
up to far more than Joe could pay over the
remaining life of the plan. The court dismissed
Joe’s case, which meant that all his previous
efforts were for naught, sending him back to
square one.
If only the tax collector had not filed that claim,
Joe would have completed his Chapter 13 plan
and received his well-deserved discharge.
Likewise, he then would have had the ability to
pay the postpetition taxes with ease.
The Bankruptcy Code arms the IRS and state
income tax authorities with several options in
dealing with postpetition taxes, and, to put it
bluntly, you’re largely subject to the whims of
the tax collectors. They can ignore your bank-
ruptcy and collect the taxes from you immedi-
ately, wait until your plan is completed and then
collect, or simply file a proof of claim in your
case. Any way you add it up, it’s a headache for
you — but there is hope.
Your lawyer needs to try to persuade the tax col-
lector to choose an option that benefits you and
the government. For example, whenever a tax
problem arises early on in your case and the
plan provides for relatively large payments to
unsecured creditors, the best course is for the
taxing authority to file a proof of claim immedi-
ately. That way, money for taxes comes out of
the share designated for unsecured creditors.
If, as in Joe’s case, the tax problem doesn’t sur-
face until late in the case, hopefully your lawyer
can persuade the tax collector not to file a claim
and to wait until your Chapter 13 is complete
and your other debts wiped out before trying to
collect postpetition taxes.

Mary filed a Chapter 13 to save her home and relieve herself of $50,000 in
credit-card debt. Her plan was confirmed, and she cured her back mortgage
payments during the first year of the plan, but she still owed most of the
credit-card debt.
Then Mary’s long-lost Uncle Joe died, leaving her $20,000. When the Chap-
ter 13 trustee learned of her inheritance, he tried to grab it for the benefit of
credit-card lenders. Relying on a 1994 amendment to the Bankruptcy Code,
Mary’s lawyer responded by converting her case to a Chapter 7, figuring that
doing so would enable her to keep the inheritance and wipe out the credit-
card debt. The court, however, balked. Deeming Mary’s conversion to a
Chapter 7 bad faith, the court made her turn over the entire $20,000 to the
Chapter 7 trustee.
Mary’s story illustrates the fact that the Bankruptcy Code neither clearly
explains what happens when a Chapter 13 debtor comes upon a valuable
asset after filing bankruptcy nor adequately addresses the question of
whether a Chapter 13 plan can be paid off early.
In Mary’s case, assume that her plan required monthly payments of $300 per
month for 36 months and that she received her inheritance in the 16th month
of the plan. Can Mary simply complete her plan and discharge her credit-card
debts by paying the trustee $6,000 ($300 monthly payment × 20 months
remaining on plan), thereby pocketing the remainder of the inheritance for
herself?
300
Part V: Strategies for a Successful Bankruptcy 
Paying off a plan ahead of time
In some areas, a Chapter 13 debtor is allowed
to borrow against his homestead and pay off a
Chapter 13 plan. But not all courts agree with
this maneuver, and if you miscalculate, it can
cost you an arm and a leg.
Consider the case of Miles.
Miles was in the middle of his Chapter 13 plan
when a home-equity lender told him that he
could take out a second mortgage on his home
equity for $20,000, use $5,000 to pay off his
Chapter 13 plan, and keep the rest for himself.
That sounded pretty good to Miles, who went
ahead with the second mortgage and hoped 
to go happily on his way with his newfound
wealth.
Well, the trustee in Miles’ case was less than
enamored with this maneuver and was no
longer willing to accept only $5,000 to cover the
Chapter 13 plan. Instead, she wanted all 
the money, claiming that every cent amounted
to disposable income. The bankruptcy court
agreed, and Mile’s miscalculation cost him 20
grand. Ouch!

The answer isn’t real clear. Most, but not all, courts would say “No,” ruling
that Mary must pay the Chapter 13 trustee all her disposable income and
that the inheritance constitutes disposable income.
In these jurisdictions, it may be best for Mary’s lawyer to try to negotiate a
deal with the Chapter 13 trustee where the debtor can keep a large portion of
the windfall to offset increased expenses (especially deferred expenses such
as home maintenance, medical or dental treatment, and car repair or replace-
ment). Fashioning a fair settlement may be better than the all-or-nothing
gamble of converting to a Chapter 7 — a gamble that Mary lost.
Tying Things Together
The rules, regulations, and nuances of bankruptcy can make your head spin,
and sometimes having a scorecard to keep track of what-ifs and what-fors
helps. Table 20-1 makes figuring out where you stand easier when your
Chapter 13 plan isn’t working out.
First, find your circumstance in the left-hand column and then look at the
four options in Table 20-1 (suspending payments, converting to a liquidation,
dismissing your Chapter 13 and filing a new Chapter 7, and asking for a hard-
ship discharge) to understand the implications.

Enjoying Your
Fresh Start

In this part . . .
You’re so close you can almost smell relief. You’ve sur-
vived the financial surgery of bankruptcy. That malig-
nant debt is a thing of the past. Now, you can build your
strength back and get on with your life. In this part, we go
over some strategies for restoring your credit and avoid-
ing the traps that can undermine all your good efforts and
hard work.

Chapter 21
Repairing Your Credit
In This Chapter
 Realizing that you’re already on the path to credit repair
 Ordering credit reports after bankruptcy
 Finding mistakes on your credit report
 Disputing items on your credit report
 Reestablishing credit
 Building credit in your own name if you’re married
L
ike life insurance or aspirin, credit is something that’s better to have
than use. Knowing it’s there if you really, really, really need it is nice.
However, you don’t want to use credit just because it’s there any more than
you want to die so that you can finally make the insurance company fork over
all those premiums you paid though the years or conk yourself on the head
so that you can use up that aspirin before the expiration date.
Granted, you’ll probably have to borrow money if you intend to buy a home,
but that isn’t a big deal when you have a halfway decent job and don’t set
your sights on the snazziest house in town. Under current guidelines, if you
have steady employment, you can qualify for a conventional mortgage (with
the same interest rate and fees as everyone else) within four years of filing
bankruptcy. If you’re willing to pay a little more in interest and fees, you can
get a mortgage sooner.
You may even need to borrow to buy a car, but it’s usually better for you to
save and pay cash for a reliable used car than to borrow heavily to finance a
flashy new vehicle that drains your bank account for years to come. And
you’ll probably want a credit card so that you can rent a video or reserve a
hotel room.

Despite misgivings about credit in general, in this chapter, we explain how to
get your credit back, point out how you’ve already taken the first step by
filing bankruptcy, describe how to access and (if necessary) clean up your
credit reports, and show you how to continue building a reputation for 
creditworthiness.
Realizing that You’ve Already Taken 
the First Step by Filing Bankruptcy
Counterintuitive as it may sound, bankruptcy is frequently the first step on
the road to credit repair.
A decade ago, lenders avoided customers with bankruptcies on their records
like the plague, but now, they’re making so much from their unconscionably
high interest rates that they’ve become less discriminating. In fact, several
companies specifically target folks who’ve recently obtained bankruptcy dis-
charges. To these lenders, you’re a financial virgin — squeaky clean, unable
to file bankruptcy again in the near future, and ripe for picking.
Nevertheless, that doesn’t mean you won’t ever encounter some short-
sighted, mean-spirited, vindictive type, dead set against giving you the bene-
fit of the doubt and resentful of your fresh start. So, getting all your ducks in
order makes sense. And one way of doing that is to make sure that your
credit reports are accurate. After you know that your credit reports show
that your debts were eliminated through bankruptcy and that your slate is
clean, you can start writing a new chapter.

Using the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
to Your Advantage
The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) together with the Fair and
Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACTA), which came into effect December
1, 2004, offer you some measure of protection against inaccurate credit
reports by guaranteeing your rights to
 Know what’s in your credit file
 Find out the name and address of any credit bureau that produces a
report that results in a denial of credit or employment and obtain a copy
of that report
 Dispute inaccurate information with both the credit bureau and directly
with the entity (“the furnisher”) that provided the information to the
bureau — usually the creditor
 Force the credit bureau to verify any information that you claim is 
wrong and to delete incorrect information when it can’t be verified
within 45 days
 Insist that corrected reports be sent to anyone who received an incor-

Getting Your Credit Reports 
after Bankruptcy
Your ability to secure credit is determined largely by credit reports issued by
Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. The reports of these three companies
show who has extended credit to you, the amounts, your payment records,
309
Chapter 21: Repairing Your Credit

and other information that can be obtained from creditors or gleaned from
public records (such as public filings of judgments and liens). Most major
lenders and many smaller local ones subscribe to one or more of the credit
bureaus. In return for receiving credit reports from the big three, subscribers
agree to furnish current information about your account.
Credit reports do not contain subjective judgments or comments. The
reports are supposed to include only the facts — your Social Security
number, birth date, addresses, employers, the status of your accounts, and
information from public records like bankruptcy, judgments, or tax liens.
A few weeks after your bankruptcy discharge is granted, you need to order
credit reports from
 Equifax, P O Box 74024, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; phone 800-685-1111; Web
site www.equifax.com.
 Experian, P O Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; phone 888-567-8688, Web site
www.experian.com.
 TransUnion, P O Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022, phone 800-888-4213, Web
site www.experian.com.
Getting credit reports for free
You’re entitled to a free copy of your credit report whenever you
 Have been denied credit during the past 60 days because of that report
 Are unemployed and intend to apply for work within the next 60 days
 Receive welfare assistance
 Believe that the report contains inaccurate information as a result of
fraud
Although some companies offer reports that combine the information from
all three credit bureaus (see Chapter 2), you may find that correcting mis-
takes is easier when you deal directly with each individual credit bureau.
Under a new law, the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies —
Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — must provide consumers, upon
request, with a free copy of their credit report once every 12 months. Call
(877) 322-8228 for more information or write to: Annual Credit Report
Request Service, P.O. Box 105281,Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. Requests by phone
or mail will be processed within 15 days of receipt.

You need to look for two things on the reports:
 Mistakes unrelated to your bankruptcy
 How your bankruptcy is reported
Correcting mistakes on your credit reports
Unfortunately, about half of all credit reports contain errors — such as
adverse information about someone with a similar name, duplicate accounts,
and obsolete data.
When you receive your report, check to make sure that it doesn’t
 Misstate your name, Social Security number, birth date, or marital status
 Include information about someone with a name similar to yours
 Contain obsolete information. Most items must be removed after seven
years. Bankruptcies may remain for ten years. Judgments remain until
the statute of limitations (which can be as long as 20 years) lapses.
 Report the same account more than once
 Inaccurately indicate that you were party to a lawsuit
 Include credit inquiries older than two years
Mistakes usually are easy to address, but you must take the initiative.
Completing the investigation request form that usually comes with a copy of
your credit report is the first thing to do. You also may want to write a letter
identifying each mistake and requesting an investigation. You should also dis-
pute errors with the furnisher — the entity providing the information — by
sending a “return receipt requested” letter stating the account number, the
basis for the dispute, and any supporting documentation. Credit bureaus and
furnishers should respond to you within 45 days.
311
Chapter 21: Repairing Your Credit
Knowing the score
Many lenders find it more efficient and cheaper
to forego individual credit reports in lieu of sta-
tistical credit scores prepared by the three
national credit bureaus. Each company pro-
duces its own score, but they’re all based on the
same computer-credit model developed by a
California company, Fair, Isaac & Company, 
Inc. Your Fair, Isaac Credit Bureau Score —
sometimes called FICO Score — is the result of
an intricate analysis of your credit history.
You can get your FICO Scores for all three credit
bureaus from www.myfico.com for about
$45. For general information about credit scor-
ing, check out www.creditscoring.com.

Deleted items have a nasty habit of reappearing on credit reports, usually
because of some computer glitch. You need to order new reports a few
months after adverse information has been deleted. If the same stuff pops up
again, write another letter to the credit bureau, and, with a little luck, this
time, they’ll fix it for good.
Whenever a mistake isn’t so obvious or involves something that isn’t verifi-
able as a matter of public record, the credit bureau checks with the creditor,
and it tends to take the creditor’s word. Subscribing creditors are the back-
bone of a credit bureau’s business, so any time an issue comes down to your
word versus the creditor’s, guess who the bureau is going to believe?
When a creditor insists that the information is correct, the credit bureau
won’t remove it. In a situation like that, you must contact the creditor
directly and in writing so that there’s a paper trail. Under the FCRA, creditors
who use credit bureaus are prohibited from intentionally reporting false
information.
Among the other duties of furnishers are
 Notifying the credit bureau whenever they discover that information
they already provided is wrong
 Providing credit bureaus with corrected information
 Including notices of the dispute — if you’re disputing that you owe the
money — when reporting the debt to credit bureaus
If the furnisher sends you a letter agreeing that information is incorrect, you
need to send a copy of that letter to the credit bureau, requesting a correc-
tion just to make doubly sure.
When the furnisher insists that the information is correct, call the credit
bureau to ask whether it can provide any suggestions. You can at least pre-
pare a written statement that explains your side of the story. In all likelihood,
however, such a statement probably won’t do any immediate good because
most creditors are linked to credit bureaus by computer, and your statement
isn’t transmitted with the credit report. Nevertheless, submitting a written
statement establishes a record. Note: The credit bureau may limit your state-
ment to 100 words, but only if it helps you write it.
Submit your statement using certified mail, with a return receipt requested,
in all communications with credit bureaus or creditors concerning disputed
issues. Doing so tends to focus their attention much more than regular mail
and establishes a written record that proves useful if you eventually end up
in court.
312
Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start 

Although the FCRA gives you the right to sue in court or complain to the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC), as a practical matter, polite persistence is
probably your best tactic. And although credit bureaus naturally are biased
toward their subscribing creditors, they really don’t want any legal trouble or
fights, particularly when it looks like you’re going to win. A well-drafted letter
from your attorney should get their attention.
Making sure that your credit reports 
properly reflect your bankruptcy
After receiving a bankruptcy discharge, all your prepetition accounts are sup-
posed to show zero balances. If they don’t, or if other mistakes are evident,
follow the instructions for disputing issues that accompany your credit
report. Send in the dispute form (always using certified mail, with a return
receipt requested), copies of your bankruptcy schedules D, E, and F (which
show all the debts you listed), the court’s notice of your 341 meeting with
creditors (which shows the date that you filed bankruptcy), and the court’s
order of discharge (which proves that your debts were wiped out). See
Chapter 6 for an explanation of your bankruptcy schedules, the 341 meeting,
and the order of discharge.
Be sure to specifically request a copy of the corrected report for you and
insist on distribution of corrected copies to all creditors who potentially
received the inaccurate version within the past six months (or within the
past two years for reports requested for employment-related purposes).
313
Chapter 21: Repairing Your Credit
Oops! Many credit reports are inaccurate
A study of credit bureaus by the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, entitled “Mistakes Do
Happen,” concludes
 Nearly one-third of all consumer credit
reports contain errors that are serious
enough to cause a denial of credit, or even
a job.
 Seventy percent contained errors of some
kind.
 Twenty percent were missing information
that could demonstrate that a consumer
was in fact creditworthy.
 Twenty-six percent of the accounts listed as
active in reports actually had already been
closed by the consumer.

Obtaining New Credit
You know how some recent college graduates complain that they can’t get a
job because they don’t have experience, and they can’t get experience
because they can’t get a job? Sometimes, obtaining new credit works the same
way. You can’t build a record of creditworthiness until you have credit, and
some lenders won’t give you credit until you’ve established a good record.
When your postbankruptcy credit reports show a clean slate, you’re halfway
home — but only halfway. Now, you must establish a good payment record
and ensure that your efforts are reflected on the credit reports. Creditors
want to know that you’re now good for your debts, and if you continue
making payments on a prepetition debt, such as a house or car loan, you’re
off to a good start. Check out the following sections for other things you can
do to start building a solid credit record.
Applying for an unsecured credit card
At the moment, obtaining an unsecured credit card (one not secured by the
items you purchase or anything else) with a modest limit is pretty easy. Many
lenders target people who have recently obtained bankruptcy discharges.
If you obtain an unsecured credit card, keep the purpose for your card firmly
in mind, remembering that the objective is to show that you can responsibly
handle debt. Use the card only for small items and make sure that you keep
up with all the payments (actually, you’d be wiser using the card only when
cash won’t do, like when renting a car or making hotel reservations). And if
you find yourself only making minimum payments, watch out! You may be
drifting into financial trouble all over again. See Chapter 22.
Beware of catalog cards that enable you to charge items from particular mer-
chants. For one thing, the company probably doesn’t sell anything that you
should even consider buying at this point. For another, you can’t be sure that
the company actually reports your payment history to credit bureaus. So,
whenever you use one of these cards, you may end up buying stuff you don’t
need without doing diddly squat to improve your credit rating.
Settling for secured credit
If you can’t get an unsecured credit card, you may be able to obtain some
form of secured credit.
314
Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start 

Local banks or credit unions may give you a small loan if you agree to main-
tain a specific balance in an account, which they, of course, promptly seize if
you don’t pay. If you go this route, however, make sure that the lender
reports your good payment history to the credit bureaus.
You may also be able to get a secured credit card. Some credit-card issuers
guarantee you a credit card as long as you keep enough money on deposit to
pay off the account. If, for example, you have a $300 line of credit, you need
to keep $300 on deposit.
Again, be certain that the issuing bank reports your diligence to the credit
bureaus. Otherwise, what’s the point?
Likewise, don’t confuse secured credit cards with debit cards that allow only
immediate deductions from your bank account. Because you don’t borrow
money with a debit card, nothing about your creditworthiness can be
reported to credit bureaus.
When shopping around for secured card, ask whether the lender flags the
card as secured when reporting to credit bureaus. If so, try to find a lender
who doesn’t. Similarly, you may want to look for a lender that’s willing to con-
vert the secured card to an unsecured card after a record of timely payments
is established.
Several online outfits provide comparisons between secured cards and
instructions for obtaining one. Keep in mind that because these companies
are heavily dependent on cooperation from the credit-card industry, they
provide a wealth of useful information about credit. Check out
 CreditComm Services LLC: www.creditcom.com.
 Ram Research Group: www.ramresearch.com
 BankRate Monitor: www.bankrate.com
You may also want to consider buying a used car from one of those we-don’t-
turn-anyone-down-for-financing outfits. But be real careful. Don’t let them sell
you a car that you can’t afford because you certainly won’t accomplish your
purpose that way. And, be prepared to pay sky-high interest rates on the loan.
Informing credit bureaus of your good
work when the creditor doesn’t
If you’re making payments to a creditor that doesn’t report to the credit
bureaus, you still can write the agencies yourself, asking them to include that
information on your report. They’re not obliged to comply, and chances are
good they won’t, but nevertheless, asking is worthwhile. When you do, be
315
Chapter 21: Repairing Your Credit

sure to include the creditor’s phone number and your account number so
that the credit bureaus can verify the information. After you’ve established a
good payment history, you also have the option of using the creditor as a
credit reference. Just make sure beforehand that the creditor is willing to
back you up.
Taking it easy when building new credit
Although building a credit history is important, you need to begin slowly. If
you go wild, applying for credit all over the place, your report probably is
going to show that you tried to get credit and failed. That kind of report
makes lenders nervous, and they begin thinking that you’re headed toward
trouble again or that they’re missing some egregious problem.
After you reestablish credit and (despite our warnings about the evils of plas-
tic) want to start regularly using credit cards, shop around for the best deal.
Many lenders entice you with ads for low interest rates but, after they’ve got
your attention, come up with some cockamamie reason why you don’t qualify
and try to sell you on a higher one. Others offer low teaser rates, but then
hike the interest after a short period of time or when you miss a payment.
Some impose outrageous fees for late payments, sticking you with a $25 fine
when you’re a day late on a $5 payment. Late fees represent as much as one-
third of the income of some credit-card issuers.
The smartest move — other than avoiding credit cards altogether (Have we
convinced you yet? We didn’t think so . . . ) — is paying off the entire balance
every month. That way, you never have to pay interest. Of course, credit-card
companies aren’t particularly fond of folks who pay their bills in full because
they lose out on collecting a ton of interest, and some even have the nerve to
cancel your account.
Watching Our for Credit-Repair Scams
Credit-repair companies can’t do anything legitimate that you can’t do for
yourself. Some are shady, some are not, and you have to be on the lookout
for scams. Run for cover whenever the company
 Tries to loan you money
 Plans to sell your name to other lenders
 Boasts that it can remove truthful information from your credit reports
316
Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start 

One common ploy that credit-repair hustlers use is repeatedly disputing neg-
ative but truthful information on your credit report, hoping that the credit
bureau drops the ball, doesn’t investigate the dispute, and, as a result, has to
delete the item. Credit bureaus are onto this game, and they don’t like it.
Even when your credit repairer succeeds in getting a legitimate item off your
report, the chances are good that the credit bureau will look a little harder in
the future and put it right back in.
Creating a new credit identity by applying for and then using a new Social
Security number to obtain a new credit file is another dumb trick. That obtain-
ing a Social Security number for fraudulent purposes is illegal is a no-brainer.
And yet, some credit-repair advisors advise you to go that route. If you do,
you’ll pay the consequences. The judge just isn’t going to care that you took
the advice of some bonehead credit-repair advisor.
Sometimes, advisors suggest that you apply for credit using a Social Security
number similar to but slightly different than your real number, hoping that
the credit bureau won’t match this fake number with an existing file but that
it will create a new one. Taking this step is illegal and stupid.
Establishing Good Credit 
When You’re Married
Each partner in a marriage needs to take responsibility for building his or her
own credit history. Married people are considered an economic unit only in
Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington,
and Wisconsin, the nine community-property states. In the other states, mar-
ried folks are entitled to establish separate credit identities and can structure
their finances so that they’re not legally responsible for the financial blunders
of the other.
Still, if your husband or wife can’t get credit in his or her own name, a joint
card may be a good idea. If you’re both legally responsible on an account and
regular payments are made, that helps both of you establish a good credit
record. Of course, the opposite is just as true — delinquencies also reflect
badly on the credit of both spouses.
Bear in mind that this joint credit applies only when both spouses are legally
responsible on the account and doesn’t apply to cases when one spouse is
merely an authorized user on the account. The authorized user isn’t legally
responsible on the account, and payments help only the credit history of the
spouse who is liable on the account.
317
Chapter 21: Repairing Your Credit

The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), and laws in many states,
indicate that a creditor can’t refuse to extend credit because of gender, mari-
tal status, race, religion, or because you’re older than 62. In noncommunity
property states, if you apply for credit in your own name, the lender isn’t sup-
posed to request information about your spouse — unless, of course, you’re
relying on your mate’s income to qualify for a loan.
If you’re about to get married, don’t merge your credit-card accounts. Keep
your spouse’s separate from yours, and, for good measure, each partner
needs to maintain one checking account in his or her own name. Similarly,
whenever you take your spouse’s name, inform your creditors and the credit
bureaus of the name change in writing. Creditors aren’t supposed to cancel
your credit simply because you got married.
The great number of people who end up in bankruptcy because of the mis-
deeds of someone who turned out to be Mr. or Ms. Wrong is a shame. Time
and time again, we see folks with a lifetime of perfect credit financially ruined
because of a spouse’s spending or problems with drugs, alcohol, or gambling.
After you discover these kinds of problems, you need to write to your credi-
tors and cancel any joint accounts and, if you’ve given your spouse authority
to charge on your accounts, terminate it right away. Doing so won’t eliminate
your responsibility for charges that already were made, but it should protect
you from future charges.
The same applies when you consider splitting up with your spouse. Be sure
to send the letter by certified mail, with a return receipt requested, and then
save copies of the letter and receipt. That way, you’ll have proof if a creditor
claims that it was never notified.
If you and your spouse are bent on maintaining a joint account and are build-
ing a good payment record, at least make sure that each person’s credit
reports reflect this good record. If not, write a letter to your creditors request-
ing that they report this favorable information to the credit bureaus — under
your name and your spouse’s name.

Staying Out of Financial Trouble
In This Chapter
 Dealing with compulsive spending
 Getting your family with the program
 Creating a workable budget
 Rejecting additional credit
 Changing your lifestyle
 Being aware of the danger signs
You know how doctors and pharmacists always tell you to take all your
antibiotics even after you’re feeling better, lest the infection recurs and
knocks the stuffing out of you? Well, the same is true with the debt bug. When
you stop taking the medicine, even though you think you’re cured, your prob-
lems almost certainly return with a vengeance. A painful financial relapse is
probably as close as a single missed paycheck or one ill-advised spending
binge.
But now that you’re ahead of the pack, you need to maintain your lead. This
chapter shows you how by explaining the importance of building a support
network and creating a realistic budget. It offers suggestions for changing
your lifestyle and reveals some telltale signs that the barbarians are again at
the gate.
Addressing Compulsive Spending
Compulsive spending is very much like an addiction and often is as difficult
to overcome. It has serious and often devastating consequences — emotional,
financial, professional, social, and so on. Mental health professionals esti-
mate that perhaps 25 percent of the American public has a buying problem,
and as many as one in six are compulsive spenders. It kind of gives the “Shop
’til you drop!” slogan a literal meaning, doesn’t it?

Experts on compulsive disorders say you can’t really make progress without
understanding the nature of the beast and directly confronting the host of
personality traits and emotional needs that feed your compulsion. And that
may require some uncomfortable soul-searching. Ask yourself
 Why do I buy things I don’t need and don’t even particularly want?
 Why do I buy little, or big, gifts for people when it isn’t their birthdays or
Christmas?
 Am I afflicted with affluenza, the curse of consumption and materialism?
Admitting that you have a problem
If you’ve become guarded and secretive about your buying, if you routinely
spend more than you intended to, if you buy to take your mind off other
things (the same way an obese person may stuff him or herself after a marital
spat), you may have a problem. If you’re unable to pass up a “good deal,” tend
to live from paycheck to paycheck and suspect you’d live that way no matter
how much money you made, or you continually obsess over how you can
juggle this debt or that bill to keep the collectors at bay, you already know
that you have a problem. Know, however, that you have loads of company.
Enrolling in Debtors Anonymous
Admitting your problem is an important first step. So, getting help is a close
second. Many compulsive spenders find aid through Debtors Anonymous
(see Chapter 2). With its 12-step process and support groups, Debtors
Anonymous helps you understand that your problem is common and that
many people have found ways to cope quite nicely with it. Contact them by
writing to Debtors Anonymous, General Service Office, P.O. Box 920888,
Needham, MA 02492-0009; phone 781-453-2743; Web site www.Debtors
Anonymous.org.
If joining support groups just isn’t your thing, you may want to look for a pri-
vate counselor who works with compulsive disorders. In any case, this chap-
ter identifies some ways to get your spending urges in check, regardless of
whether you get outside professional help.
Building a Consensus with Loved Ones
You needed the support of your friends and relatives when you first thought
about filing bankruptcy, and you need it just as much now. The people closest
to you need to understand that the same way a person recovering from 
320
Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start 

open-heart surgery isn’t the best candidate to play center in a bruising
pickup hockey game, you’re not the one to grab the tab or the one to hit up
for a donation every time little Buster sells candy bars for Little League. In
short, the expectations that loved ones have for you need to conform with
the new reality.
And you know what? They will. When you stay on the financial wagon, your
pals and kin adjust accordingly. And so will you.
Establishing common ground with your
mate on money matters
Regardless of whether your significant other filed bankruptcy with you, you
are, to a large extent, in this together, for better or worse. Obviously, the
household budget will implode if one of you is acting responsibly and the
other isn’t. It’s kind of like riding a bicycle built for two — the stoker has to
go where the pilot goes, or everyone’s gonna get some boo-boos. So, remem-
ber that the project is a joint one, and you need to tackle it in tandem.
Creating realistic expectations 
from your offspring
When you’re deep in financial do-do, chances are that your kids need to get
real as much as you. Maybe that costly excursion to the amusement park
needs to be a once-a-year treat rather than an every-weekend entitlement.
Yeah, the kids may get cranky, but they’ll get over it. And dollars to donuts,
you’ll all find something to do that’s much less expensive but just as 
satisfying — like going to the public park or the library or . . .
Using a Budget
In Chapter 2, we recommend keeping a record of every penny you spend.
That’s good advice there, and it’s good advice here. But you’re more likely to
succeed in budgeting when you view your spending plan not as something
that restrains you, but rather as something that empowers you. In other
words, look at a budget as your way of taking control, not as something that
controls you.
321
Chapter 22: Staying Out of Financial Trouble

Developing a system for tracking 
what you spend
Many computer programs can help you track expenses and create a budget.
Although computer programs can make budgeting a game, they can also be 
a pain in the rear when the novelty wears off. In our experience, you’re better
off with a little notebook, and one big rule: Everything — and we mean 
everything — gets recorded. After you know exactly where your money goes,
you’ll almost certainly stop, or at least slow, the bleeding.
The worksheets in Chapter 2 help you create a budget. We’re not going to
suggest what you should spend on specific items. By now, you know enough
to be sure that you aren’t spending more than you have coming in every
month and that you’re saving for that inevitable rainy day.
Sticking to the plan
Sticking with any personal development schedule — whether it’s an exercise
plan, a diet, whatever — is difficult, and staying on a budget is particularly
stressful. One good way to save money is to enroll in a payroll deduction pro-
gram, like the kind offered through credit unions. That way, a certain amount
of your paycheck goes directly into savings. It’s right there if you really need
it, and safely stashed until that need arises. Again, however, think need, not
want.
Avoiding Temptation
Although offering credit to folks with obvious spending problems is the moral
equivalent of providing booze to a recovering alcoholic, credit-card compa-
nies do it all the time. Everywhere you turn, you face temptation. Although
resisting the lure of credit isn’t easy, you can do it, but it nevertheless helps
when you can eliminate at least some sources of enticement.
Reducing credit-card solicitations
Those credit-card offers that clutter your mailbox certainly are a pain, but
you can try sending a note to the solicitor asking to be removed from its mail-
ing list. That may work, but in all honesty, you’ll probably be ignored. One of
our favorite jokes is stuffing all the crap that they send you into their prepaid
322
Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start 

envelope and mailing it back. Turning the tables on credit-card companies,
making them not only open junk mail, but also receive nothing in return, 
and pay the postage to boot is incredibly satisfying. Ah, revenge is sweet —
particularly when it’s justice personified! And solicitors listen much more
carefully when something actually costs them money.
Removing your name from 
direct-marketing lists
As unlikely as it seems, those mosquitolike companies using the direct mar-
keting tactic really don’t want to get under your skin. The Direct Marketing
Association even provides a service called the Mail Preference Service (MPS).
When you sign up, your name is placed in a do-not-mail file. (Although sign-
ing up online at www.the-dma.org costs $5, you can register for free via
snail mail by printing the online form at www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/off
mailinglist and mailing it to Mail Preference Service, Attn: Dept: 7377757,
Direct Marketing Association, P.O. Box 282, Carmel, NY 10512.)
Members of the Direct Marketing Association are required to check the list
before sending solicitations. Doing so is a smart move on their part because
they don’t want to waste their time and money on people like you who aren’t
going to take the bait, and they realize no mileage can be gained from ticking
you off.
Also, the Federal Trade Commission has set up a toll-free number that allows
people to stop all credit-card solicitations: 888-567-8688 (888-5-OPTOUT).
Reigning in telemarketers
The Federal government created the national registry to make it easier and
more efficient for you to stop telemarketing calls. You can register online at
www.donotcall.gov or call toll-free, 1-888-382-1222 (TTY 1-866-290-4236),
from the number you wish to register. Registration is free.
Placing your number on the registry will stop most, but not all, telemarketing
calls.
Some states also offer do-not-call registries that may block telemarketers who
are presently exempt from the federal regulations, such as political pollsters
and charities. Check with your state’s consumer protection bureau (it may be
part of the attorney general’s office) to see whether your state offers this 
service.

Chapter 22: Staying Out of Financial Trouble

Making a Few Lifestyle Changes
When you keep track of what you’re spending, you’ll probably discover that
many of your expenditures are simply a matter of habit — the $2 latte you get
on the way to work, the $1 you plop in the soda pop machine, the $2.50 you
spend for an afternoon snack. It all adds up, big time. But you can save a
bundle by bringing your own coffee, soda, and snack — bought at supermar-
ket prices. By simply tracking your expenses, you’re sure to cut out many of
these impulse buys.
Figuring out your priorities
Studies show that Americans spend 6 hours per week shopping, but only 40
minutes actively playing with their kids. Something is seriously askew about
that ratio.
But more and more people are getting their priorities in order and opting out
of the consumption rat race by downshifting — working less, spending less,
making more meaningful use of their time, and devoting more energy to rais-
ing their children. The seminal downshifting organization is probably the
Seattle-based New Road Map Foundation (www.scn.org/earth/lightly
/vsacpbak.htm). You may also want to check out the Center for a New
American Dream at www.newdream.org. Both of these Web sites provide
links to tons of information on living a simpler and more rational life.
Thinking about ways to save moneys
Simple awareness of what you have and where it goes helps you save money.
Can you save a couple bucks by parking a block farther away? Do you really
want dessert with your meal? Can you get a better rate on a plane ticket
through Priceline.com? When you train yourself to be more conscious of
what things cost, you naturally cut your expenditures.
Discovering how to live without credit
Life without credit is as basic as forcing yourself to use cash. Give yourself a
monthly cash allowance and make your credit cards off-limits, or better yet,
cut them up and throw them away. If you don’t have the dough in your
pocket to make a purchase, you know right away that you can’t afford what-
ever you’re thinking about buying. Granted, some expenditures require more
than you have in your wallet, but you’re still almost always better off using
your savings than going into hock.

Part VI: Enjoying Your Fresh Start 

If you absolutely must borrow money to buy a car, focus on the total amount
you’re borrowing, not the monthly payment. When dickering with a car sales-
man, don’t even go down the monthly payment path. The issue isn’t how
much it will cost you every month but rather how much you’ll end up paying
in the end.
Discovering cheap ways to have fun
After growing up poor during the Great Depression, our parents were experts
at finding inexpensive ways of having fun and discovering myriad imaginative
uses for cardboard boxes. We can all garner some lessons from our beloved
parents, Big Jim and Fitz: Take a hike, literally. Rent a video rather than going
to see a movie. Borrow a book from the library instead of buying it (except
for this one, of course). Watch an amateur baseball game at the park rather
than a pro game at the stadium. The possibilities are limited only by your
imagination.
Recognizing Danger Signs
In the same way that a scratchy throat signals an oncoming cold, plenty of
telltale signs warn you that the debt demons are back on your track. You
must keep your eyes open, but these gremlins are fairly easy to detect and
stare down when you know what you’re looking for.
Watching for telltale signals
At this point, you know when you’re headed for trouble. If you’re using one
credit card to pay off another, buying junk you don’t need, or ignoring your
budget, cut it out! Remember, you’re in control and the responsibility is
yours. As soon as you adopt a victim’s mind-set, you’ve ceded power to the
creditors. Never forget that control of your finances is in your own hands —
and the moment you feel like you’re losing control, you probably already
have.
If you get to this point, immediately stop buying on credit and borrowing
money. Then, turn to Chapter 2 for pointers on stopping the financial 
hemorrhaging.
325
Chapter 22: Staying Out of Financial Trouble

Living without savings
If you have nothing squirreled away for a rainy day, you’re living on the edge.
The best thing you can do with your extra cash is put it in a savings account
used only for emergencies. Financial planners usually advise that you have at
least six months’ worth of income set aside.
When developing a budget (see our earlier discussion in this chapter in the
section “Using a Budget” and also Chapter 2), be sure to include an item for
savings.
Using debt-to-income and equity ratios
Financial advisors frequently suggest that you watch your debt-to-equity
ratios to see whether you’re drifting too far into debt. In our view, that’s great
when you’re a CPA or figurehead. But using such formulas is pretty useless
for most folks because they don’t have realistic ideas about how much their
assets are really worth. In any case, here are a couple formulas if you’re the
numbers-crunching type:
 Debt-to-income ratio formula No. 1: Many so-called experts say that
you’re okay as long as your debts are between 10 to 20 percent of your
income. However, these same experts disagree about whether to include
mortgages as a part of your total debts and whether using gross income
or net income is appropriate. If you’re taking this approach, we recom-
mend including all mortgage debts, except the first mortgage on your
home. We also suggest using net income rather than gross income.
 Debt-to-equity ratio formula No. 2: Taking the value of your assets into
account is important in this method of determining how much debt you
should carry. Divide the total amount of your debts, including all mort-
gages, by the value of all your assets. As a general rule, 30 percent is
deemed acceptable.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his part includes some nifty lists of ten things you can
do right now — regardless of whether you end up
filing for bankruptcy — to ease your financial burdens, ten
mistakes you want to avoid, and ten of the most common
questions we hear from folks pondering bankruptcy in the
aftermath of the Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Fiasco (BARF)
of 2005.

Chapter 23
Ten Common Bankruptcy
Mistakes
In This Chapter
 Borrowing to beat bankruptcy
 Dealing with assets and debts
O
ne mantra that we definitely preach: Play it straight and simple. Some
debtors get into trouble because they try to manipulate the system, or
they outright lie and cheat. For them, we have no sympathy whatsoever. May
a thousand red ants invade their armpits!
Many more people turn their lawyers’ hair gray with well-intentioned but ill-
conceived efforts at making the most of a bad situation. That’s unfortunate
and unnecessary. You can easily avoid most pitfalls when you know where
they are. This chapter lists the most common errors so that you can sidestep
them now and avoid the hassles of dealing with them later.
Borrowing Money from Relatives
Asking your parents, children, or rich uncle for a loan is awfully tempting —
but if you do, you’ll probably live to regret it. For one thing, asking for a loan
inevitably stresses relationships, and you’re going to need the support and
encouragement of your family as you undertake the bankruptcy process. For
another, you simply can’t borrow your way out of debt. Unless your benefac-
tor has more money than she knows what to do with, filing bankruptcy and
wiping out debts that you can’t afford to pay just makes more sense to us
than hitting up your loved ones.

Repaying Money Owed to Relatives
If you ignore our advice and end up accepting a loan from a relative, about
the worst thing you can do is pay it back if you’re planning to file bankruptcy
within the next year. Strange as it may seem, a bankruptcy trustee can sue
any relative who received $600 or more from you during the year prior to
bankruptcy — even if the payment was on a perfectly legitimate debt. The
rationale is that your relatives shouldn’t be paid when other creditors are left
holding the bag.
Chipping Away at Debts with 
a Home-Equity Loan
We can’t say it often enough: You can’t borrow your way out of debt. It’s
pretty obvious that banks and other lenders are really pushing home-equity
loans, and it’s pretty obvious why. If they can get you to sign over the most
valuable and most important asset in your life, they have you right where
they want you — scared out of your wits and willing to eat regurgitated dog
food if necessary to keep up with your payments. Don’t yield that kind of
power to lenders. Odds are that if you file bankruptcy instead of obtaining a
home-equity loan, you’ll not only wipe out those pesky debts, but you’ll also
be able to keep your home.
Draining Retirement Accounts 
to Pay Debts
Read that heading again! That’s a bad, bad idea — albeit one that some credit
counselors advocate. If there’s even a remote chance that you’ll end up in
bankruptcy court, there’s no point in squandering your retirement account.
Oftentimes, pensions are protected in bankruptcy — meaning that you get to
keep your retirement benefit and creditors can’t touch it. However, if you vol-
untarily sign over your pension or drain it to pay the credit-card company,
that money’s lost; it’s gone forever.
330
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Neglecting to Accurately 
List All Creditors
A bankruptcy petition is no place to wing it. Don’t guess. Instead, get it right.
Make sure that all your creditors are listed. If you screw up, you can amend
your petition later . . . maybe. But that’s a bunch of trouble, and if the judge
thinks you tried to hide something or mislead the court, she may well
become very grumpy. Although some exceptions are in place, you neverthe-
less need to assume that if you fail to list a creditor with an accurate mailing
address, that debt may not get wiped out.
Concealing Your Assets
People who monitor bankruptcies aren’t stupid, and they generally don’t
have much of a sense of humor. When you go out of your way looking for
trouble, you’ll surely find it. Don’t play games. Don’t assume that things will
go unnoticed. Don’t “forget” to mention the vintage Mercedes sitting in your
garage. Just play it straight.
Transferring Assets to Keep Them 
Away from Creditors
Many people transfer their assets with the best of intentions, often shifting
property to their children or other loved ones to keep it away from the grop-
ing paws of creditors. You can’t do that. And, if you try, you’ll almost cer-
tainly cause trouble for yourself and quite possibly for the relative or friend
to whom you transferred property.
Making Payments that You 
Can’t Afford to Make
Making payments to a bill collector that you can’t afford to make is money
down the drain, simple as that. Coming up with a few bucks here and a few
there to temporarily pacify bill collectors puts a great deal of pressure on
you. But the finger-in-the-dike approach quickly becomes overwhelming. You
simply don’t have enough digits, or dollars, to plug all those holes, and you’ll
probably stretch yourself to the breaking point if you try.
331
Chapter 23: Ten Common Bankruptcy Mistakes

Thinking that Bankruptcy 
Is Your Last Resort
Much can be said for preventive medicine — in matters of health as well as 
in matters of finance. So, we urge you to look at bankruptcy as a financial-
planning decision rather than as your fiscal funeral. You don’t have to wait
until your home equity is blown, your relationships are shot, and your pen-
sion is kaput before exerting your right to a fresh start. As a rule: If you can’t
fully pay off all your debts (except mortgages) within three years while living
a reasonably restrained lifestyle, you definitely need to consider bankruptcy.
Filing Bankruptcy Too Soon
Although filing for bankruptcy sooner rather than later usually is better for
most folks, in some circumstances, delaying a bit is to your advantage. For
example, if you’re contemplating divorce, expecting a sizeable income tax
refund, in the process of repaying debts to family members (or have been in
the recent past), or owing taxes that may be dischargeable in the near future,
it can be better to wait. However, it’s never too early to discuss your situation
and your options with a good bankruptcy lawyer.

Chapter 24
Ten Things You Can Do Right Now
to Ease Your Financial Woes
In This Chapter
 Getting your financial affairs in order
 Establishing what your assets are worth
F
olks swimming against the high tide of debt frequently feel powerless.
Some are even inclined to just let go and allow the current to take them
wherever it may — even if it’s smack into the jagged rocks. Don’t do that.
No matter how bleak things may seem, you’re still in control, and the list of
what you can do to relieve the burdens on your bank account (if you still
have one) and your psyche (we assume that you have one) is a long one.
Maybe you can’t quite manage to swim upstream, but plenty of branches are
jutting out from the banks for you to grasp so you at least won’t go over the
falls. You only need to grab hold, hang on tight, and keep your head up, even
if — especially if — you’re up to your neck in debt doo-doo.
Think of this chapter as your temporary lifeline. It shows you how to survive
until you get your bearings and how to take those first tentative steps toward
dry land.
Stop Feeling Guilty
Okay, so maybe you screwed up. Get over it. Although in our experience, 
the far more likely scenario is that something unexpected pushed you over
the edge. No matter how you ended up in your present predicament, you
won’t gain any mileage by beating yourself up. What has happened, has hap-
pened. The past is past, but tomorrow is money in the bank — literally and
figuratively.

Cut Up Your Credit Cards
Start with this premise: You can’t borrow your way out of debt (are we get-
ting redundant on that? Good!). Using Card B to pay off Card A isn’t going to
solve the problem. It’ll only make matters worse.
In all but a few situations, you don’t really need a credit card. Sure, a credit
card makes shopping easier, especially from mail-order catalogs and online
merchants, but the last thing you need right now is more temptation.
Pick one credit card to save — preferably one with a zero balance — and put
it in a drawer, not your purse or wallet. Reserve that card for those few situa-
tions where only plastic will do, such as auto rentals and possibly hotel reser-
vations. Now take a deep breath and cut up all the rest of your cards and put
the pieces in an envelope so that you can remind yourself of the commitment
that you’ve made. Join the ranks of smart and happy campers who pay cash
or do without. You’ll be surprised how liberating escaping the yoke of credit
cards can be. It just feels good, kind of like the way it feels to take a shower
when you’re all sweaty.
Again, take control.
Order Your Credit Reports
The first step toward taking control is knowing the score and understanding
just where you stand. Of course, you can pluck the petals off a daisy, playing
“she loves me/she loves me not,” but you’ll probably get a more realistic
answer from your credit reports. Obtaining them shouldn’t cost any more
than ten bucks. You can order your reports from the big three reporting 
agencies:
 Equifax, P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374-0241; phone 800-685-1111;
Web site www.equifax.com
 Experian, P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; phone 800-682-7654; Web site
www.experian.com
 TransUnion, P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022; phone 800-851-2674; Web
site www.transunion.com
See Chapter 6 for more tips on tracking down your creditors.
334
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Keep Track of Everything You Buy
Keep a list of everything you buy. Write it down, write it all down — every-
thing from donuts to dentists. Yeah, doing so is a definite pain in the rear, but
that’s actually the point. If you have to do some work every time that you buy
a gumball, you may figure that impulse to buy is more trouble than it’s worth.
Besides, identifying the holes in your pockets so that you can realistically
consider what’s needed, what’s not, and what’s in between is the smart thing
to do.
Get Your Name off Any Joint Accounts
Joint accounts are often convenient, especially for married couples. But they
can create plenty of headaches in times of financial distress. Keeping your
credit accounts separate is better because when you have a joint account,
you’re legally responsible for the debts of your mate (and vice versa).
Stop Making Partial Payments 
on Credit-Card Bills
Whenever you’re making only partial payments on your credit cards, bank-
ruptcy may be on the horizon and, quite frankly, is more likely probable,
although most people put off the inevitable as long as possible. In short,
making partial payments on your credit-card debt is money down the flusher.
Besides, you have no incentive for making payments now, for a couple of rea-
sons. One main reason is that if you file bankruptcy, you stand a good chance
of not having to pay those debts (or at least not all of them). The second
reason: At this point, you’d do better using that money for bare necessities,
so you’re better equipped to resist temptation to pull out your credit card for
groceries.
Call a Lawyer Now If You’re Being Sued
or Foreclosure Is Underway
If you don’t respond to a lawsuit, the other side automatically wins and
obtains a judgment, which may limit your options if you end up filing bank-
ruptcy. Have a lawyer look at the lawsuit papers while you still have time to
respond.
335
Chapter 24: Ten Things You Can Do Right Now to Ease Your Financial Woes

If a foreclosure already has started and you want to keep the property, find
out the date of the foreclosure sale and call a bankruptcy lawyer right away. If
bankruptcy isn’t filed before the foreclosure sale date, it may be too late to
save the property.
Find Out How Much Your 
Home and Car Are Worth
Odds are your house and vehicles are among the most valuable assets you
have. But you need to know just how valuable they are. For your home, you
can check with the local assessor to obtain a ballpark figure of what it’s
worth. However, those figures are notoriously inaccurate, and you’d do
better finding out what similar homes in your neighborhood are selling for.
For your car, check out the Kelley Blue Book at www.kbb.com.
Empty Accounts in Banks 
Where You Owe Money
If you owe a bank money, and the bank is sitting on your cash, you can pretty
well figure out what happens next. Before it dawns on the banker to seize
whatever stash you have, pull it out of his reach. You need to decide where
your assets will do the most good at this point (hint: not the mall), and you
don’t need the bank making that decision for you. Oh, your money may, of
course, go back to the bank at some point, but, for now, you need to marshal
your forces until you figure out how they’d be most effectively deployed.
Sharpen Your Pencil and Start Filling
Out the Worksheets in Chapter 2
You have some homework to do, and we bet you’ll feel much better when it’s
done. Filling out the worksheets in Chapter 2 gives you a firmer grasp of your
situation. An enemy is much easier to overcome when you know the nature of
the beast. Regardless of whether you eventually file bankruptcy, taking an
inventory is crucial. We’ve tried to make that chore as painless as possible
with our worksheets in Chapter 2.

Chapter 25
Ten Common Questions 
about Bankruptcy
In This Chapter
 Putting bankruptcy hobgoblins to rest
 Glimpsing the pros and cons of bankruptcy
B
ankruptcy — the B-word — conjures up images of horror, torment, and
eternal financial damnation. In this chapter, we lay many of these buga-
boos to rest, and place others in proper perspective.
Will Bankruptcy Damage 
My Credit Rating?
Yes.
Credit bureaus are allowed to report your bankruptcy for up to ten years
from the date bankruptcy is filed, and generally do just that in Chapter 7
cases. With Chapter 13 cases, major reporting agencies usually delete men-
tion of your bankruptcy after seven years, assuming, that is, you successfully
complete the court-approved repayment plan. In either case, for seven to ten
years, any time you seek credit — for a house, a car, for anything — your
bankruptcy will factor in.
Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, only certain people and entities
are allowed access to your credit information, including credit-card compa-
nies, insurance firms, and prospective employers who sometimes review
credit reports to determine whether a job applicant is financially stable. No
one else is entitled to look at your credit report.

On the other hand, bankruptcy filings are public court records, available for-
ever to anyone who wants to scour the files. The record is there in the court-
house or in federal archives whenever anyone cares to see it, and as more
and more records are stored on computers, searching that kind of data will
become easier and easier.
Nevertheless, even with a bankruptcy, the odds of your obtaining credit are
very good. With a little work and perseverance, you can reestablish credit
almost immediately. (Some credit-card companies actually target folks right
after bankruptcy because they know their slates are clean.) So, don’t lose any
sleep worrying about your credit. Instead, see Chapter 21 and get to work
restoring your good credentials. You may have to pay a higher interest rate
for a few years until your credit is fully restored, but you may not if you shop
around.
Will Bankruptcy Affect My Job?
It shouldn’t.
Employers are barred by federal law from firing or in any way discriminating
against you because of a bankruptcy petition. And unless you volunteer infor-
mation about your bankruptcy, your employer probably won’t even know.
You may not want to tell your employer before your bankruptcy is actually
filed because it is unclear whether someone who reveals plans to file bank-
ruptcy in the future (but has not filed) is protected from firing or discrimina-
tion. In addition, remember that prospective employers are among the entities
legally entitled to check out your credit reports. A poor credit rating or a
bankruptcy may lead a potential employer to reject you.
Will I Lose My Home?
Probably not.
Few people ever lose their homes solely because of bankruptcy, but it can
happen. It all boils down to how much your house is worth, your mortgage
balance, how far you’re behind in your payments, and which state you live in.
See Chapter 12 for more information.
338
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Will I Lose My Personal Belongings?
Probably not.
Debtors are allowed to keep all their stuff in about 94 percent of personal
bankruptcies. The reason debtors keep their stuff is that most personal
belongings are off-limits to creditors or simply aren’t worth enough to bother
with.
Will I Ever Be Able to Buy a House?
Probably.
As a general rule, you stand a pretty good chance of getting a conventional
mortgage about four years after your debts have been wiped out in bank-
ruptcy, assuming, of course, that your income is high enough for you to qual-
ify. You may qualify even sooner when you’re willing to go through a finance
company and pay more fees and higher interest rates.
Does My Spouse Have to File
Bankruptcy, Too?
Not necessarily.
You’re usually not responsible for your spouse’s debts, unless, of course, you
cosigned and promised the creditor that you’d cover for your wife or husband.
A divorce decree sometimes also makes you liable for your ex’s spending.
However, when you live in one of the nine community property states (Arizona,
California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and
Wisconsin), the story is different. In those states, so-called community prop-
erty belonging to both spouses is subject to debts incurred by either spouse.
Community property includes the earnings of you and your spouse, and any
property acquired by either of you (except for gifts and inheritances) during
the marriage.
339
Chapter 25: Ten Common Questions about Bankruptcy

Can I Keep Some Debts Off My
Bankruptcy and Deal with Them
Separately?
No.
Your bankruptcy petition must list every one of your creditors.
If you mistakenly forget to list a creditor, you can amend your bankruptcy
papers. But doing so is a hassle, and life’s much simpler when you get it right
from the get-go. Additionally, if the court somehow thinks you intentionally
excluded a creditor, you can find yourself in a heap of trouble.
You can voluntarily repay any creditor after you file. And you can always con-
tinue regular house or car payments so that those creditors aren’t affected by
your bankruptcy.
Can I Cancel My Bankruptcy 
If I Change My Mind?
That depends.
You can’t dismiss a Chapter 7 — or a Chapter 13 that was converted from a
Chapter 7 — unless you convince the court that dismissal is in the best inter-
est of creditors. But, absent fraud or other misconduct, you can dismiss a
Chapter 13 that was never in Chapter 7 without court permission. However,
remember that even if your case is dismissed, the bankruptcy may still show
up on your credit reports.
Is Filing Bankruptcy a Long, 
Protracted Process?
Not at all.
Your petition can be filed within a matter of days, and, after that happens, the
automatic stay kicks in, collection activities cease, and you’re on your way.
340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 

About 40 days later, you and your lawyer meet with creditors (the 341 
meeting) — see Chapter 6. At that hearing, you take an oath and answer
some questions about your financial affairs.
Most Chapter 7 cases are closed within four months of the petition date.
Chapter 13 repayment cases remain open for the length of your plan (basi-
cally three to five years). But, as a practical matter, after the judge approves
your repayment plan, the procedural stuff is dispensed with as long as you
continue making your payments.
Does It Cost a Bundle to File?
It shouldn’t.
You have to pay a court filing fee of $274 for a Chapter 7 or $189 for a 
Chapter 13. You also have to pay your lawyer, and BARF creates more work
for attorneys. It’s too early to tell how much lawyers will have to increase
their fees to cover the additional hours they spend on even run-of-the-mill
bankruptcies. If the cost seems high, yell at the politicians who voted for this
consumer-hostile measure.
Will BARF Make it More Painful 
to File Bankruptcy?
Yes, it will. Congress — or, more accurately, the credit lobby — wanted to
make filing bankruptcy more cumbersome. It succeeded. Lots of new hurdles
are in your way, such as the Means Test (see Chapter 5), but for the most
part, they amount to little more than a distraction and annoyance. In the final
analysis, if you can’t pay your bills, you’re entitled to a fresh start.

Appendix
Homestead Exemption Laws
A
lthough bankruptcy law is generally the province of the federal govern-
ment, a number of states have their own provisions with regard to
exemptions, giving people the chance to choose between exemptions offered
under the Bankruptcy Code (federal exemptions) and those provided by their
own state legislature.
Debtors can choose local or Bankruptcy Code exemptions in the following
places: Arkansas, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, the Virgin
Islands, Washington, and Wisconsin. Bankruptcy Code exemptions may be
available in other states in certain circumstances where you changed states
in the past two years (see Chapter 10).
Choosing between Federal and 
State Exemptions
You generally apply the law of the state of your permanent home for the two
years before bankruptcy. If, for example, you lived in the same state two
years ago as you do now, the laws of your present state apply.
But if your permanent home has not been in a single state for this two-year
period, the law that applies is that of the state where you lived for 180 days
immediately prior to that two-year period, or for the longer portion of this
180-day period than any other state.
Generally, you have to stick with one set of exemptions; the law usually doesn’t
allow debtors to shop for the best deal. Also, joint debtors must both agree
to choose local or federal exemptions. In other words, one spouse can’t pluck
the state exemptions if the other elects to go the federal route.

344
Personal Bankruptcy Law For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Identifying the Federal Homestead
Exemption
Keep in mind that at each three-year interval ending on April 1, the exemp-
tion allowed under the Bankruptcy Code is adjusted to reflect changes in the
Consumer Price Index. The Judicial Conference of the United States publishes
the dollar amount in the Federal Register 30 days before the change takes
effect. The amounts next change on April 1, 2007. So far, every adjustment
has increased the amount of the homestead exemption, so if the federal
exemption applies to you and you’re near or over the limit, you may be better
off waiting until the next adjustment.
Married debtors may each claim the full amount for separate property and
double these amounts for jointly owned property. The present exemption
amount is $18,450 and isn’t limited to real property (land and buildings), so
mobile homes, and possibly even travel trailers, qualify. But the property
must be your actual home or the home of your dependent.
Surveying State Homestead Exemptions
To find out more about exemptions for your particular state, log on to www.
bankruptcyaction.com or americanbankruptcy.com/pdfexemption
tables/states.htm or www.bankruptcyinformation.com/services.
html. But be careful because state exemption laws are always changing, and
these Web sites aren’t always up to date. The only way to know for sure
whether your property is exempt is to ask your lawyer.
Note: If you acquired your present home within 1,215 days of bankruptcy,
your homestead exemption may not exceed $125,000, even if state law allows
more. But this restriction is limited to the extent that you used the proceeds
of a prior homestead in the same state to purchase your present home —
unless, of course, the first residence was also acquired within 1,215 days of
bankruptcy. For example, assume that you moved to Florida in 1995 and
bought a home for $500,000 cash. Then, in 2005, you sold this home and used
the money to buy a new home in Florida for $500,000. The $125,000 limitation
doesn’t apply even if you filed bankruptcy within 1,215 days of acquiring your
new home.
There is also an absolute $125,000 cap on homesteads if the debtor has been
convicted of specified federal securities law or has committed criminal acts
or other intentional or reckless acts that caused serious injury or death
within five years of bankruptcy.
Although BARF isn’t clear on the subject, we believe that if a husband and
wife own their homestead together and file a joint bankruptcy, the $125,000
limit could be doubled to $250,000.

Alabama: Up to $5,000, and land
can’t exceed 160 acres. Husband and
wife may double.
Alaska: $64,800. Although joint
debtors may each claim exemption,
combined amount may not exceed
$64,800.
Arizona: $150,000 real property or
mobile home. Joint debtors may not
double.
Arkansas: Unlimited.
California: $50,000 if single and not
disabled; $75,000 family residences;
$150,000 if debtor is 65 or older; dis-
abled; or if 55 or older and, if single,
earns $15,000 or less or, if married,
joint income of less than $20,000.
Note: Debtors may choose a home-
stead exemption under a different 
set of California exemptions that are
similar to the exemptions under the
U.S. Code.
Colorado: Real property, certain
manufactured home, or mobile
homes — $45,000. Husband and wife
may not double. House trailer used
as residence — $3,500. Mobile home
used as residence — $6,000.
Connecticut: $75,000. Husband and
wife may double.
Delaware: $50,000.
District of Columbia: Unlimited.
Florida: Unlimited value, up to 2
acres in municipality or 160 contigu-
ous acres elsewhere.
Georgia: $10,000. Husband and wife
may double.
Hawaii: $30,000 for head of family or
individual 65 or older, all others
$20,000. Husband and wife may
double.
Idaho: $50,000.
