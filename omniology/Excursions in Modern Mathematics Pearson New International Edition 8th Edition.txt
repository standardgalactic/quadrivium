The  
Mathematics  
of Elections
The Paradoxes of Democracy
Whether we like it or not, we are all affected by the outcomes of 
elections. Our president, senators, governors, and mayors make 
decisions that impact our lives in significant ways, and they all 
get to be in that position because an election made it possible. 
But elections touch our lives not just in politics. Academy Awards, 
American Idol, Heisman trophies, football rankings—they are all 
decided by means of an election. Even something as simple as 
deciding where to go for dinner might require a mini-election.

e have elections because we don’t all think alike. Since we cannot all have 
things our way, we vote. But voting is only the first half of the story, the 
one we are most familiar with. As playwright Tom Stoppard suggests, it’s 
the second half of the story—the counting—that is at the heart of the democratic 
process. How do we sift through the many choices of individual voters to find the 
collective choice of the group? More important, how well does the process work? 
Is the process always fair? Answering these questions and explaining a few of the 
many intricacies and subtleties of voting theory are the purpose of this chapter.
But wait just a second! Voting theory? Why do we need a fancy theory to figure 
out how to count the votes? It all sounds pretty simple: We have an election; we 
count the ballots. Based on that count, we decide the outcome of the election in a 
consistent and fair manner. Surely, there must be a reasonable way to accomplish 
this! Surprisingly, there isn’t.
In the late 1940s the American economist Kenneth Arrow discovered a remark-
able fact: For elections involving three or more candidates, there is no consistently 
fair democratic method for choos-
ing a winner. In fact, Arrow 
demonstrated that a method 
for determining election results 
that is always fair is a mathematical impossibility. This 
fact, the most famous in voting theory, is known as 
Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem.
This chapter is organized as follows. We 
will start with a general discussion of elections
and ballots in Section 1. This discussion pro-
vides the backdrop for the remaining sec-
tions, which are the heart of the chapter. In 
Sections 2 through 5 we will explore four of 
the most commonly used voting methods—
how they work and how they are used in 
real-life applications. In Section 6 we will 
introduce some basic principles of fairness 
for voting methods and apply these fairness 
criteria to the voting methods discussed in 
Sections 2 through 5. The section concludes 
with a discussion of the meaning and signifi-
cance of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem.

It’s not the voting that’s democracy; 
it’s the counting.

The Mathematics of Elections
n The outcome. The purpose of an election is to use the information provided by 
the ballots to produce some type of outcome. But what types of outcomes are 
possible? The most common is winner-only. As the name indicates, in a winner-
only election all we want is to find a winner. We don’t distinguish among the 
Big or small, important or trivial, all elections share a set of common elements.
n The candidates. The purpose of an election is to choose from a set of candidates 
or alternatives (at least two—otherwise it is not a real election). Typically, the 
word candidate is used for people and the word alternative is used for other 
things (movies, football teams, pizza toppings, etc.), but it is acceptable to use 
the two terms interchangeably. In the case of a generic choice (when we don’t 
know if we are referring to a person or a thing), we will use the term candidate. 
While in theory there is no upper limit on the number of candidates, for most 
elections (in particular the ones we will discuss in this chapter) the number of 
candidates is small.
n The voters. These are the people who get a say in the outcome of the election. In 
most democratic elections the presumption is that all voters have an equal say, 
and we will assume this to be the case in this chapter. (This is not always true.) 
The number of voters in an election can range from very small (as few as 3 or 4) 
to very large (hundreds of millions). In this section we will see examples of both.
n The ballots. A ballot is the device by means of which a voter gets to express 
his or her opinion of the candidates. The most common type is a paper bal-
lot, but a voice vote, a text message, or a phone call can also serve as a “bal-
lot” (see Example 5 American Idol). There are many different forms of ballots 
that can be used in an election, and Fig. 1 shows a few common examples. The 
simplest form is the single-choice ballot, shown in Fig. 1(a). Here very little is 
being asked of the voter (“pick the candidate you like best, and keep the rest 
of your opinions to yourself!”). At the other end of the spectrum is the pref-
erence ballot, where the voter is asked to rank all the candidates in order of 
preference. Figure 1(b) shows a typical preference ballot in an election with five 
candidates. In this ballot, the voter has entered the candidates’ names in order 
of preference. An alternative version of the same preference ballot is shown in  
Fig. 1(c). Here the names of the candidates are already printed on the ballot and 
the voter simply has to mark first, second, third, etc. In elections where there 
are a large number of candidates, a truncated preference ballot is often used. In 
a truncated preference ballot the voter is asked to rank some, but not all, of the 
candidates. Figure 1(d) shows a truncated preference ballot for an election with 
dozens of candidates.

The Mathematics of Elections
nonwinners. There are, however, situations where we want a broader outcome 
than just a winner—say we want to determine a first-place, second-place, and 
third-place candidate from a set of many candidates (but we don’t care about 
fourth place, fifth place, etc.). We call this type of outcome a partial ranking. 
Finally, there are some situations where we want to rank all the candidates in 
order: first, second, third, . . . , last. We call this type of outcome a full ranking, 
or just a ranking for short.
n The voting method. The final piece of the puzzle is the method that we use to 
tabulate the ballots and produce the outcome. This is the most interesting (and 
complicated) part of the story, but we will not dwell on the topic here, as we will 
discuss voting methods throughout the rest of the chapter.
It is now time to illustrate and clarify the above concepts with some examples.
We start with a simple example of a fictitious election. This is an important ex-
ample, and we will revisit it many times throughout the chapter. You may want to 
think of Example 1 as a mathematical parable, its importance being not in the story 
itself but in what lies hidden behind it. (As you will soon see, there is a lot more to 
Example 1 than first meets the eye.)
example 1  The maTh Club eleCTion (Winner-only)
The Math Appreciation Society (MAS) is a student club dedicated to an unsung 
but worthy cause: that of fostering the enjoyment and appreciation of mathemat-
ics among college students. The MAS at Tasmania State University is holding its 
annual election for club president, and there are four candidates running: Alisha, 
Boris, Carmen, and Dave (A, B, C, and D for short).
Every member of the club is eligible to vote, and the vote takes the form of a 
preference ballot. Each voter is asked to rank each of the four candidates in order of 
preference. There are 37 voters who submit their ballots, and the 37 preference bal-
lots submitted are shown in Fig. 2.
Last but not least, what about the outcome of the election? Since the purpose of 
the election is to choose a club president, it is pointless to discuss or consider which 
candidate comes in second place, third place, etc. This is a winner-only election.

example 2  The maTh Club eleCTion (Full ranking)
Suppose now that we have pretty much the same situation as in Example 1 (same 
candidates, same voters, same preference ballots), but that the election is to choose 
not only the president of the club but also a vice-president, a treasurer, and a secre-
tary. According to the club bylaws, the president is the candidate who comes in first, 
the vice-president is the candidate who comes in second, the treasurer is the can-
didate who comes in third, and the secretary is the candidate who comes in fourth. 
5

The Mathematics of Elections
Given that there are four candidates, each candidate will get to be an officer, but 
there is a big difference between being elected president and being elected treasurer 
(the president gets status and perks; the treasurer gets to collect the dues and bal-
ance the budget). In this version how you place matters, and the outcome should be 
a full ranking of the candidates.
example 4  The heisman Trophy
The Heisman Memorial Trophy Award is given annually to the “most outstanding 
player in collegiate football.” The Heisman, as it is usually known, is not only a very 
prestigious award but also a very controversial award. With so many players playing 
so many different positions, how do you determine who is the most “outstanding”?
In theory, any football player in any division of college football is a potential 
candidate for the award. In practice, the real candidates are players from Division 
I programs and are almost always in the glamour positions—quarterback or run-
ning back. (Since its inception in 1935, only once has the award gone to a defensive 
player—Charles Woodson of Michigan.)
There are approximately 930 voters (the exact number of voters varies each 
year). The voters are members of the media plus all past Heisman award winners 
still living, plus one vote from the public (as determined by a survey conducted by 
ESPN). Each voter submits a truncated preference ballot consisting of a first, sec-
ond, and third choice (see Fig. 1[d]). A first-place vote is worth 3 points, a second-
place vote 2 points, and a third-place vote 1 point. The candidate with the most total 
points from all the ballots is awarded the Heisman trophy in a televised ceremony 
held each December at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York.
While only one player gets the award, the finalists are ranked by the number 
of total points received, in effect making the outcome of the Heisman trophy a 
partial ranking of the top four (sometimes five) candidates. (For the 2011 season, 
the Heisman Trophy went to Robert Griffin III, Baylor; second place to Andrew 
Luck, Stanford; third place to Trent Richardson, Alabama; fourth place to Montee 
Ball, Wisconsin; and fifth place to Tyrann Mathieu, LSU.)
example 3  The aCademy aWards
The Academy Awards (also known as the Oscars) are given out each 
year by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for Best Pic-
ture, Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Director, and many other, lesser 
categories (Sound Mixing, Makeup, etc.). The election process is not 
the same for all awards, so for the sake of simplicity we will just discuss 
the selection of Best Picture.
The voters in this election are all the eligible members of the Acad-
emy (approximately 6000 voters—5755 for the 2011 awards). After a 
complicated preliminary round (a process that we won’t discuss here) 
ten films are selected as the nominees—these are our candidates. (For 
most other awards there are only five nominees.) Each voter is asked to 
submit a preference ballot ranking the ten candidates. There is only 
a winner (the other candidates are not ranked), with the winner de-
termined by a voting method called plurality-with-elimination that 
we will discuss in detail in Section 4. (The winner of the 2011 Best  
Picture Award was The Artist.)
The part with which people are most familiar comes after the bal-
lots are submitted and tabulated—the annual Academy Awards ceremony, held 
each year in late February. How many viewers realize that behind one of the most 
extravagant and glamorous events in pop culture lies an election?

The Mathematics of Elections
Examples 1 through 5 represent just a small sample of how elections can be 
structured, both in terms of the ballots (think of these as the inputs to the election) 
and the types of outcomes we look for (the outputs of the election). We will revisit 
some of these examples and many others as we wind our way through the chapter.
example 5  AmericAn idol
The single most watched program in the history of American television is American 
Idol, a singing competition for individuals (as opposed to The X-Factor, a similar 
singing competition that allows for groups as well as individuals). Each year, the 
winner of American Idol gets a big recording contract, and many past winners have 
gone on to become famous recording artists (Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, 
Taylor Hicks). While there is a lot at stake and a big reward for winning, Ameri-
can Idol is not a winner-only competition, and there is indeed a ranking of all the 
finalists. In fact, some nonwinners (Clay Aiken, Jennifer Hudson) have gone on to 
become great recording artists in their own right.
The 12 (sometimes 13) candidates who reach the final 
rounds of the competition compete in a weekly televised 
show. During and immediately after each weekly show 
the voters cast their votes. The candidate with the fewest 
number of votes gets eliminated from the competition, 
and the following week the process starts all over again 
with one fewer candidate (on rare occasions two candi-
dates are eliminated in the same week—see Table 11). 
And who are the voters responsible for deciding the fate of 
these candidates? Anyone and everyone—you, me, Aunt  
Betsie—we are all potential voters. All one has to do to 
vote for a particular candidate is to text or call a toll-free 
number specific to that candidate (“to vote for Carly, call 
1-866-IDOLS07,” etc.). American Idol voting is an ex-
ample of democracy run amok—you can vote for a can-
didate even if you never heard her sing, and you can vote 
as many times as you want.
By the final week of the competition there are only two finalists left, and after 
one last frenzied round of voting, the winner is determined. (For the 2011 American 
Idol competition there were nearly 750 million votes cast. Table 11 shows a sum-
mary of the results.)
preference ballots and preference schedules
Let’s focus now on elections where the balloting is done by means of preference bal-
lots, as in Examples 1 and 2. The great advantage of preference ballots (compared 
with, for example, single-choice ballots) is that they provide a great deal 
of useful information about an individual voter’s preferences—in both 
direct and indirect ways.
To illustrate what we mean, consider the preference ballot shown in 
Fig. 3. This ballot directly tells us that the voter likes candidate C best, B 
second best, D third best, and A last. But, in fact, this ballot tells us a lot 
more—it tells us unequivocally which candidate the voter would choose if it 
came down to a choice between just two candidates. For example, if it came 
down to a choice between, say, A and B, which one would this voter choose? Of course 
she would choose B—she has B above A in her ranking. Thus, a preference ballot allows 
us to make relative comparisons between any two candidates—the candidate higher on 
the ballot is always preferred over the candidate in the lower position. Please take note of 
this simple but important idea, as we will use it repeatedly later in the chapter.

The Mathematics of Elections
The second important idea we will use later is the fact that the relative preferences 
in a preference ballot do not change if one of the candidates withdraws or is eliminated. 
Once again, we can illustrate this using Fig. 3. What would happen if for some unfore-
seen reason candidate B drops out of the race right before the ballots are tabulated? 
Do we have to have a new election? Absolutely not—the old ballot simply 
becomes the ballot shown on the left in Fig. 4. The candidates above B stay 
put and each of the candidates below B moves up a spot.
In an election with many voters, some voters will vote exactly the 
same way—for the same candidates in the same order of preference. 
If we take a careful look at the 37 ballots submitted for the Math Club 
election shown in Fig. 2, we see that 14 ballots look exactly the same (A 
first, B second, C third, D fourth), another 10 ballots look the same, and 
so on. So, if you were going to tabulate the 37 ballots, it might make sense to put all 
the A-B-C-D ballots in one pile, all the C-B-D-A ballots in another pile, and so on. 
If you were to do this you would get the five piles shown in Fig. 5 (the order in which 
you list the piles from left to right is irrelevant). Better yet, you can make the whole 
idea a little more formal by putting all the ballot information in a table such as Table 
1, called the preference schedule for the election.

We will be working with preference schedules throughout the chapter, so 
it is important to emphasize that a preference schedule is nothing more than a 
convenient bookkeeping tool—it summarizes all the elements that constitute the 
input to an election: the candidates, the voters, and the balloting. Just to make 
sure this is clear, we conclude this section with a quick example of how to read 
a preference schedule.
example 6  The CiTy oF kingsburg mayoral eleCTion
Table 2 shows the preference schedule sum-
marizing the results of the most recent elec-
tion for mayor of the city of Kingsburg (there 
actually is a city by that name, but the elec-
tion is fictitious). Just by looking at the pref-
erence schedule we can answer all of the rel-
evant input questions:
n  Candidates: there were five candidates (A, 
B, C, D, and E, which are just abbrevia-
tions for their real names).

n  Voters: there were 300 voters that submitted ballots (add the numbers at the 
head of each column: 93 + 44 + 10 + 30 + 42 + 81 = 300).
n Balloting: the 300 preference ballots were organized into six piles as shown in 
Table 2.
The question that still remains unanswered: Who is the winner of the election? 
In the next four sections we will discuss different ways in which such output ques-
tions can be answered.
Ties
In any election, be it a winner-only election or a ranking of the candidates, ties can 
occur. What happens then?
In some elections the rule is that ties are allowed to stand and need not be bro-
ken. Here are a few interesting examples:
n  In the 1968 Academy Awards, Katharine Hepburn and Barbra Streisand tied 
for Best Actress. Both received Oscars.
n  In the 1992 Grammy Awards, Lisa Fischer and Patti La Belle tied for Best 
Female R&B Vocal Performance and shared the award.
n  In the 1979 National League MVP balloting, Keith Hernandez and Willie 
Stargell tied for first and shared the award.
n  In the 2011 American Idol competition, Thia Megia and Naima Adepapo 
tied for 10th place. They were declared as sharing the 10th–11th position (see 
Table 11).
In other situations, especially in elections for political office (president, sena-
tor, mayor, city council, etc.), ties cannot be allowed (can you imagine having co- 
mayors?), and then a tie-breaking rule must be specified. The Constitution, for 
example, stipulates how a tie in the Electoral College is broken, and most elections 
have a set rule for breaking ties. The most common method for breaking a tie for 
political office is through a runoff election, but runoff elections are expensive and 
take time, so many other tie-breaking procedures are used. Here are a few interest-
ing examples:
n  In the 2009 election for a seat in the Cave Creek, Arizona, city council, Thomas 
McGuire and Adam Trenk tied with 660 votes each. The winner was decided  
by drawing from a deck of cards. Mr. McGuire drew first—a six of hearts.  
Mr. Trenk (the young man with the silver belt buckle) drew next and drew a 
king of hearts. This is how Mr. Trenk became a city councilman.
n  In the 2010 election for mayor of Jefferson City, 
Tennessee, Rocky Melton and Mark Potts tied 
with 623 votes each. The decision then went to 
a vote of the city council. Mr. Potts became the 
mayor.
n  In the 2011 election for trustees of the Island Lake, 
Illinois, village board, Allen Murvine and Charles 
Cernak tied for one of the three seats with 576 
votes each. The winner was decided by a coin toss.  
Mr. Cernak called tails and won the seat.
Ties and tie-breaking procedures add another layer  
of complexity to an already rich subject. To simplify 
our presentation, in this chapter we will stay away 
from ties as much as possible. In the rare example 
where a tie occurs, we will assume that the tie does not 
have to be broken.

The Mathematics of Elections
The plurality method is arguably the most commonly used and simplest method for 
determining the outcome of an election. With the plurality method, all that mat-
ters is how many first-place votes each candidate gets: In a winner-only election 
the candidate with the most first-place votes is the winner; in a ranked election the 
candidate with the most first-place votes is first, the candidate with the second most 
is second, and so on.
For an election decided under the plurality method, preference ballots are not 
needed, since the voter’s second, third, etc. choices are not used. But, since we al-
ready have the preference schedule for the Math Club election (Examples 1 and 2) 
let’s use it to determine the outcome under the plurality method.
The Plurality Method
2
The vast majority of elections for political office in the United States are decided 
using the plurality method. The main appeal of the plurality method is its simplicity, 
but as we will see in our next example, the plurality method has many drawbacks.
example 7  The maTh Club eleCTion under The pluraliTy meThod
We discussed the Math Club election in Section 1. 
Table 3 shows once again the preference schedule 
for the election. Counting only first-place votes, we 
can see that A gets 14, B gets 4, C gets 11, and D gets 
8. So there you have it: In the case of a winner-only 
election (see Example 1) the winner is A (Headline: 
“Alisha wins presidency of the Math Club”); in the 
case of a ranked election (see Example 2) the results 
are: A first (14 votes); C second (11 votes); D third 
(8 votes); B fourth (4 votes). (Headline: “New board 
of MAS elected! President—Alisha; VP—Carmen; 
Treasurer—Dave; Secretary—Boris.”)

example 8  The 2010 maine governor’s eleCTion
Like many states, Maine chooses its governor using the plurality method. In the 
2010 election there were five candidates: Eliot Cutler (Independent), Paul LePage  
(Republican), Libby Mitchell (Democrat), Shawn Moody (Independent), and 
Kevin Scott (Independent). Table 4 shows the results of the election. Before 
reading on, take a close look at the numbers in Table 4 and draw your own con-
clusions.

The Mathematics of Elections
A big problem with the plurality method is that when there are more  
than two candidates we can end up with a winner that does not have a major-
ity (i.e., more than 50%) of the votes. The 2010 Maine gubernatorial election 
is a case in point. As Table 4 shows, Paul LePage became governor with the 
support of only 38.2% of the voters (which means, of course, that 61.8% of 
the voters in Maine wanted someone else). A few days after the election, an 
editorial piece in the Portland Press Herald expressed the public concern about 
the outcome.
The election of Paul LePage with 38 percent of the vote means Maine’s next gov-
ernor won’t take office with the support of the majority of voters—a situation that 
has occurred in six of the last seven gubernatorial elections . . . . Some people . . .  
say it’s time to reform the system so Maine’s next governor can better represent the 
consensus of voters. (Is Winning an Election Enough? Portland Press Herald, 
Nov. 10, 2010)
The second problem with the Maine governor election is the closeness of the 
election: Out of roughly 571,000 votes cast, less than 10,000 votes separated the win-
ner and the runner-up. This is not the plurality method’s fault, but it does raise the 
possibility that the results of the election could have been manipulated by a small 
number of voters. Imagine for a minute being inside the mind of a voter we call  
Mr. Insincere: “Of all these candidates, I like Kevin Scott the best. But if I vote for 
Scott I’m just wasting my vote—he doesn’t have a chance. All the polls say that it  
really is a tight race between LePage and Cutler. I don’t much care for either one, 
but LePage is the better of two evils. I’d better vote for LePage.” The same thinking, 
of course, can be applied in the other direction—voters afraid to “waste” their vote 
on Scott (or Moody, or Mitchell) and insincerely voting for Cutler over Le Page. 
The problem is that we don’t know how many insincere votes went one way or the 
other, and the possibility that there were enough insincere votes to tip the results of 
the election cannot be ruled out.
While all voting methods can be manipulated by insincere voters, the plural-
ity method is the one that can be most easily manipulated, and insincere voting is 
quite common in real-world elections. For Americans, the most significant cases 
of insincere voting occur in close presidential or gubernatorial races between the 
two major party candidates and a third candidate (“the spoiler”) who has little 
or no chance of winning. Insincere voting not only hurts small parties and fringe 
candidates, it has unintended and often negative consequences for the political 
system itself. The history of American political elections is littered with examples 
of independent candidates and small parties that never get a fair voice or a fair 
level of funding (it takes 5% of the vote to qualify for federal funds for the next 
election) because of the “let’s not waste our vote” philosophy of insincere voters. 
The ultimate consequence of the plurality method is an entrenched two-party 
system that often gives the voters little real choice.
The last, but not least, of the problems with the plurality method is that a can-
didate may be preferred by the voters over all other candidates and yet not win the 
election. We will illustrate how this can happen with the example of the fabulous 
Tasmania State University marching band.
example 9  The Fabulous Tsu band goes boWling
Tasmania State University has a superb marching band. They are so good that this 
coming bowl season they have invitations to perform at five different bowl games: 
the Rose Bowl (R), the Hula Bowl (H), the Fiesta Bowl (F), the Orange Bowl 
(O), and the Sugar Bowl (S). An election is held among the 100 band members 
to decide in which of the five bowl games they will perform. Each band member 
11

The Mathematics of Elections
submits a preference ballot ranking 
the five choices. The results of the 
election are shown in Table 5.
Under the plurality method 
the winner of the election is the 
Rose Bowl (R), with 49 first-place 
votes. It’s hard not to notice that 
this is a rather bad outcome, as 
there are 51 voters that have the 
Rose Bowl as their last choice. By 
contrast, the Hula Bowl (H) has 
48 first-place votes and 52 second-
place votes. Simple common sense 
tells us that the Hula Bowl is a far better choice to represent the wishes of the entire 
band. In fact, we can make the following persuasive argument in favor of the Hula 
Bowl: If we compare the Hula Bowl with any other bowl on a head-to-head basis, 
the Hula Bowl is always the preferred choice. Take, for example, a comparison 
between the Hula Bowl and the Rose Bowl. There are 51 votes for the Hula Bowl 
(48 from the second column plus the 3 votes in the last column) versus 49 votes 
for the Rose Bowl. Likewise, a comparison between the Hula Bowl and the Fiesta 
Bowl would result in 97 votes for the Hula Bowl (first and second columns) and 3 
votes for the Fiesta Bowl. And when the Hula Bowl is compared with either the 
Orange Bowl or the Sugar Bowl, it gets all 100 votes. Thus, no matter with which 
bowl we compare the Hula Bowl, there is always a majority of the band that prefers 
the Hula Bowl.

The Borda Count Method
3
The second most commonly used method for determining the winner of an election 
is the Borda count method, named after the Frenchman Jean-Charles de Borda. In 
this method each place on a ballot is assigned points. In an election with N candi-
dates we give 1 point for last place, 2 points for second from last place, and so on. 
At the top of the ballot, a first-place vote is worth N points. The points are tallied 
for each candidate separately, and the candidate with the highest total is the win-
ner. If we are ranking the candidates, the candidate with the second-most points 
comes in second, the candidate with the third-most points comes in third, and so 
on. We will start our discussion of the Borda count method by revisiting the Math 
Club election.
A candidate preferred by a majority of the 
voters over every other candidate when the 
candidates are compared in head-to-head com-
parisons is called a Condorcet candidate (named 
after the Marquis de Condorcet, an eighteenth-
century French mathematician and philosopher). 
Not every election has a Condorcet candidate, 
but if there is one, it is a good sign that this candi-
date represents the voice of the voters better than 
any other candidate. In Example 9 the Hula Bowl 
is the Condorcet candidate—it is not unreason-
able to expect that it should be the winner of the 
election. We will return to this topic in Section 6.

The Mathematics of Elections
When we tally the points,
A gets 56 + 10 + 8 + 4 + 1 = 79 points,
B gets 42 + 30 + 16 + 16 + 2 = 106 points,
C gets 28 + 40 + 24 + 8 + 4 = 104 points,
D gets 14 + 20 + 32 + 12 + 3 = 81 points.
The Borda winner of this election is Boris! (Wasn’t Alisha the winner of this 
election under the plurality method?)
If we have to rank the candidates, B is first, C second, D third, and A fourth. To 
see what a difference the voting method makes, compare this ranking with the rank-
ing obtained under the plurality method (Example 7).
example 10  The maTh Club eleCTion (borda CounT)
Table 6 shows the preference schedule for the Math Club election with the Borda 
points for the candidates shown in parentheses to the right of their names. For  
example, the 14 voters in the first column ranked A first (giving A 14 * 4 = 56 points), 
B second (14 * 3 = 42 points), and so on.

For general details on the Heisman Award, see Example 4. The Heisman is deter-
mined using a Borda count, but with truncated preference ballots: each voter chooses 
a first, second, and third choice out of a large list of candidates, with a first-place 
vote worth 3 points, a second-place vote worth 2 points, and a third-place vote worth 
1 point.

The Mathematics of Elections
In real life, the Borda count method (or some variation of it) is widely used 
in a variety of settings, from individual sport awards to music industry awards to 
the hiring of school principals, university presidents, and corporate executives. It is 
generally considered to be a much better method for determining the outcome of an 
election than the plurality method. In contrast to the plurality method, it takes into 
account the voter’s preferences not just for first place but also for second, third, etc., 
and then chooses as the winner the candidate with the best average ranking—the 
best compromise candidate, if you will.
a preference schedule. Because the Heisman uses truncated preference ballots and 
many candidates get votes, it is easier and more convenient to summarize the bal-
loting this way.
The last column of Table 7 shows the ranking of the finalists: Robert Griffin 
III (Baylor) won the Heisman easily, Andrew Luck (Stanford) was second, Trent 
Richardson (Alabama) was third, Montee Ball (Wisconsin) was fourth, and Tyrann 
Mathieu (LSU) was fifth.
Many variations of the standard Borda count method are possible, the most 
common being using a different set of values for the positions on the ballot. We 
will call these modified Borda count methods. Example 12 illustrates one situation 
where a modified Borda count is used.
Table 8 shows the top five finalists for the 2010 National League Cy Young 
award. An unusual thing happened in this election—Roy Halladay (Phillies) was the 
unanimous first choice of all 32 voters, thus garnering the maximum possible points 
(32 * 7 = 224), a very rare event indeed.
example 12  The 2010 naTional league Cy young aWard
The Cy Young Award is an annual award given by Major League baseball for 
“the best pitcher” in each league (one award for the American League and one 
for the National League). For the National League award there 
are 32 voters (they are baseball writers—two from each of the 16 
cities having a National League team), and each voter submits a 
truncated preference ballot with a first, second, third, fourth, and 
fifth choice. The modification in the Cy Young calculations (in 
effect for the first time with the 2010 award) is that first place is 
worth 7 points (rather than 5). The other places in the ballot count 
just as in a regular Borda count: 4 points for second, 3 points for 
third, 2 points for fourth, and 1 point for fifth. The idea here is to 
give extra value to first-place votes—the gap between a first and a 
second place should be bigger than the gap between a second and 
a third place.

The Mathematics of Elections
In the United States most municipal and local elections have a majority require-
ment—a candidate needs a majority of the votes to get elected. With only two can-
didates this is rarely a problem (unless they tie, one of the two candidates must have 
a majority of the votes). When there are three or more candidates running, it can 
easily happen that no candidate has a majority. Typically, the candidate or candi-
dates with the fewest first-place votes are eliminated, and a runoff election is held. 
But runoff elections are expensive, and in these times of tight budgets more efficient 
ways to accomplish the “runoff” are highly desirable.
A very efficient way to implement the runoff process without needing runoff 
elections is to use preference ballots, since a preference ballot tells us not only 
which candidate the voter wants to win but also which candidate the voter would 
choose in a runoff (with one important caveat—we assume the voters are consis-
tent in their preferences and would stick with their original ranking of the candi-
dates). The idea is to use the information in the preference schedule to eliminate 
the candidates with the fewest first-place votes one at a time until one of them gets 
a majority. This method has become increasingly popular and is nowadays known 
under several different names, including plurality-with-elimination, instant runoff 
voting (IRV), ranked choice voting (RCV), and the Hare method. For the sake of 
clarity, we will call it the plurality-with-elimination method—it is the most descrip-
tive of all the names.
Here is a formal description of the plurality-with-elimination method:
The Plurality-with-Elimination Method

n round 1. Count the first-place votes for each candidate, just as you would in 
the plurality method. If a candidate has a majority of first-place votes, then that 
candidate is the winner. Otherwise, eliminate the candidate (or candidates if 
there is a tie) with the fewest first-place votes.
n round 2. Cross out the name(s) of the candidates eliminated from the preference 
schedule and transfer those votes to the next eligible candidates on those ballots. 
Recount the votes. If a candidate has a majority then declare that candidate the 
winner. Otherwise, eliminate the candidate with the fewest votes.
n rounds 3, 4, . . . Repeat the process, each time eliminating the candidate with 
the fewest votes and transferring those votes to the next eligible candidates. 
Continue until there is a candidate with a majority. That candidate is the winner 
of the election.
In a ranked election the candidates should be ranked in reverse order 
of elimination: the candidate eliminated in the last round gets second place, 
the candidate eliminated in the second-to-last round gets third place, and 
so on.

The Mathematics of Elections
The winner of the election is D! For a ranked election we 
have D first, A second (eliminated in round 3), C third (elimi-
nated in round 2), and B last (eliminated in round 1).
In this round C has the fewest first-place votes and is elimi-
nated.
round 3. The 11 votes that went to C in round 2 are all trans-
ferred to D (per columns 2 and 5 of Table 9). The new tally is

went to B are transferred to D (per column 4 of Table 9). The

Our next example illustrates a few subtleties that can come up when applying 
the plurality-with-elimination method.
example 14  The CiTy oF kingsburg mayoral eleCTion
Table 10 shows the preference schedule for the Kingsburg mayoral election first 
introduced in Example 6. To save money Kingsburg has done away with runoff 
elections and now uses plurality-with-elimination for all local elections. (Notice that 
since there are 300 voters voting in this election, a candidate needs 151 or more 
votes to win.)

Here C has the fewest number of first-place votes and is eliminated first. Of the 
40 votes originally cast for C, 10 are transferred to A (per column 3 of Table 10) 
and 30 are transferred to E (per column 4 of Table 10).

Now D has the fewest first-place votes and is eliminated. The 42 votes originally 
cast for D would be transferred to C (per column 5 of Table 10), but C has 
already been eliminated, so the next eligible candidate is E (column 5 again). 
Thus, the 42 votes are transferred to E.
round 3.
Since this is a winner-only election we are done! E has a majority and is declared 
the winner. (If this were a ranked election, we would continue on to Round 4, only 
to determine second place between A and B.)
Several variations of the plurality-with-elimination method are used in real-life 
elections. One of the most popular goes by the name instant runoff voting (also 
called ranked choice voting in some places). Instant runoff voting uses a truncated 
preference ballot (typically asking for just first, second, and third choice). Once the 
ballots are cast the process works very much like plurality-with-elimination: the can-
didate with the fewest first-place votes is eliminated and his votes are transferred to 
the second-place candidates in those ballots; in the next round the candidate with 
the fewest votes is eliminated and her votes are transferred to the next eligible can-
didate, and so on. There is one important difference: unlike regular plurality-with-
elimination there is a point at which some votes can no longer be transferred (say 
your vote was for candidates X, Y, and Z —if and when all three of them are elimi-
nated there is no one to transfer your vote to). Such votes are called exhausted votes 
and although perfectly legal, they don’t count in the final analysis.
Instant runoff voting is used in several U.S. cities in elections for mayor and city 
council, including San Francisco, Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Oakland, California, as well 
as in elections for political office in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. We will 
illustrate how instant runoff voting works with the 2010 election for mayor of Oakland.
example 15  The 2010 oakland mayoral eleCTion
In 2010 the city of Oakland, California introduced instant runoff voting for the first 
time in all city elections with three or more candidates.
The election for mayor had 10 candidates. The top three candidates were Don 
Perata, Jean Quan, and Rebecca Kaplan; the remaining seven candidates had rela-
tively few votes and for simplicity they will be lumped together under the name 
17

The Mathematics of Elections
“Others.” There were 122,265 ballots cast, with each 
voter ranking up to three candidates (ballots with 
just one or two candidates are allowed). Of the origi-
nal 122,265 ballots, 16,499 were exhausted (more 
on that later), so the final analysis is based on the 
105,766 ballots that really counted. Figure 7 shows 
a summary of how the election went. (To simplify 
the calculations Fig. 7 shows percentages rather than 
the number of actual votes.) In the first count, Perata 
had 33.73% of the votes, Quan had 24.47%, Kaplan 
had 21.58%, and the seven other candidates together 
had 20.22%. In rounds 1 through 7 all the minor can-
didates were eliminated one at a time and their votes 
transferred to the top three candidates or exhaust-
ed: 6.43% were transferred to Perata, 6.47% were 
transferred to Quan, and 7.32% transferred to Ka-
plan. Round 8 starts with Perata at 40.16%, Quan at 
30.94%, and Kaplan at 28.9%. Perata is still the clear 
leader. Kaplan has the fewest votes (barely) and is 
eliminated. Kaplan’s votes are transferred—8.88% 
to Perata and 20.02% to Quan. In the final round 
Quan overtakes Perata 50.96% to 49.04% and is  
declared mayor of Oakland.
Note that a ballot that did not include either  
Perata or Quan did not count in the final analysis: at 
some point before round 9 all of the candidates on 
that ballot were eliminated, and at that point there 
was no candidate to transfer that ballot to. This  
explains the 16,499 exhausted ballots.

As mentioned earlier in this section, the practical advantage of plurality-with-
elimination is that it does away with expensive and time-consuming runoff elections. 
There is one situation, however, where expense is not an issue and delaying the 
process is part of the game: televised competitions such as Dancing with the Stars, 
The X-Factor, and American Idol. The longer the competition goes, the higher the 
ratings—having many runoffs accomplishes this goal. All of these “elections” work 
under the same variation of the plurality-with-elimination method: have a round of 
competition, vote, eliminate the candidate (or candidates) with the fewest votes. 
The following week have another round of competition and repeat the process. This 
builds up to the last round of competition, when there are two finalists left. Millions 
of us get caught up in the hoopla. We will illustrate one such election using the 2011 
American Idol competition.
example 16  The 2011 AmericAn idol CompeTiTion
We discussed American Idol as an election in Example 5. Table 11 shows the evo-
lution of the 2011 competition. As noted in Example 5, the winner is the big deal, 
but how the candidates place in the competition is also of some relevance, so we 
consider American Idol a ranked election. Working our way up from the bottom 
of the table, we see that the first candidate eliminated was Ashton Jones. This 
puts Ashton in 13th place. The second week Karen Rodriguez was eliminated. This 
puts Karen in 12th place. The third week no one was eliminated (there is a rule 
that allows the judges to give candidates a free pass to the next round). The fourth 
week Naima Adepapo and Thia Megia were eliminated in the same round (an-
other mysterious rule). Naima and Thia were declared tied for 10th–11th place.

And so it went for a full three months. In the final week, after a lot of controversy, 
it came down to Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery. Lauren was eliminated last, 
and Scotty became the 2011 American Idol.

The Method of Pairwise Comparisons
5
One of the most useful features of a preference schedule is that it allows us to find 
the winner of any pairwise comparison between candidates. Specifically, given any 
two candidates—call them X and Y—we can count how many voters rank X above 
Y and how many rank Y above X. The one with the most votes wins the pairwise 
comparison. This is the basis for a method called the method of pairwise comparisons 
(sometimes also called Copeland’s method). For each possible pairwise comparison 
between candidates, give 1 point to the winner, 0 points to the loser (if the pairwise 
comparison ends up in a tie give each candidate 1
2 point). The candidate with the most 
points is the winner. (If we are ranking the candidates, the candidate with the second-
most points is second, and so on.) The method of pairwise comparisons is very much 
like a round-robin tournament: (1) every player plays every other player once; (2) the 
winner of each “match” gets a point and the loser gets no points (if there is a tie each 
gets 1
2 point); and (3) the player with the most points wins the tournament.
As usual, we will start with the Math Club election as our first example.
example 17  The maTh Club eleCTion (pairWise Comparisons)
Table 12 shows, once again, the preference schedule 
for the Math Club election. With four candidates, there 
are six possible pairwise comparisons to consider:  
(1) A v B, (2) A v C, (3) A v D, (4) B v C, (5) B v D, 
and (6) C v D. We’ll look at (1) A v B and (6) C v D 
and leave the details of the other four to the reader.

The Mathematics of Elections
n  A v B: The first column of Table 12 represents 14 
votes for A (A is ranked higher than B); the remain-
ing 23 votes are for B (B is ranked higher than A in 
the last four columns of the table). The winner of 
this comparison is B.
n  C v D: The first, second, and last columns of Table 
12 represent votes for C (C is ranked higher than 
D); the third and fourth columns represent votes for 
D (D is ranked higher than C). Thus, C has 25 votes 
to D’s 12 votes. The winner of this comparison is C.
We continue this way, checking the results of all 
six possible comparisons (try it now on your own,  
before you read on!). Once you are done, you should 
get something along the lines of Table 13 with a sum-
mary of the results (a sort of scoreboard, if you will.) 
From Table 13 one can immediately figure out the outcome of the election: In a 
winner-only election the winner is C (with 3 points); in a ranked election C is first 
(3 points), B second (2 points), D third (1 point), and A fourth (no points).

If you have been paying close attention, you 
may have noticed that the results of the Math 
Club election have been different under each of 
the voting methods we have discussed—both in 
terms of the winner and in terms of the ranking 
of the candidates. This can be seen quite clearly 
in the summary results shown in Table 14. It is 
amazing how much the outcome of an election 
can depend on the voting method used!
One more important comment about Ex-
ample 17: Notice that C was the undefeated 
champion, as C won each of the pairwise com-
parisons against the other candidates. (We  
already saw that there is a name for a candidate that beats all the other candidates 
in pairwise comparisons—we call such a candidate a Condorcet candidate.) The 
method of pairwise comparisons always chooses the Condorcet candidate (when 
there is one) as the winner of the election, but this is not true with all methods. 
Under the plurality method, for example, you can have a Condorcet candidate that 
does not win the election (see Example 9).
Although the method of pairwise comparisons is a pretty good method, in 
real-life elections it is not used as much as the other three methods we discussed. 
In the next example we will illustrate one interesting and meaningful (if you are 
a football fan) application of the method—the selection of draft choices in the 
National Football League. Because NFL teams are extremely secretive about how 
they make their draft decisions, we will illustrate the general idea with a made-up 
example.

example 18  The nFl draFT
The Los Angeles LAXers are the newest expansion team in the NFL and are awarded  
the first pick in the upcoming draft. The draft committee (made up of coaches, 
scouts, and team executives) has narrowed down the list to five candidates: Allen, 
Byers, Castillo, Dixon, and Evans. After many meetings, the draft committee is 
ready to vote for the team’s first pick in the draft. The election is to be decided using 
the method of pairwise comparisons.

Table 15 shows the preference schedule obtained after each of the 22 mem-
bers of the draft committee submits a preference ballot ranking the five candidates. 
There is a total of 10 separate pairwise comparisons to be looked at, and the results 
are shown in Table 16 (we leave it to the reader to check the details.)

We can see from Table 16 that the winner of the election is Allen with 3 points. 
Notice that things are a little trickier here: Allen is the winner of the election even 
though the draft committee prefers Byers to Allen in a pairwise comparison be-
tween the two. We will return to this example in Section 6.
You probably noticed in Examples 17 and 18 that, compared with the other 
methods, pairwise comparisons takes a lot more work. Each comparison requires 
a separate calculation, and there seems to be a lot of comparisons that need to be 
checked. How many? We saw that with 4 candidates there are 6 separate com-
parisons and with 5 candidates there are 10. As the number of candidates grows, 
the number of comparisons grows even more. Table 17 illustrates the relation  
21

The Mathematics of Elections
So far, this is what we learned: There are many different types of elections 
and there are different ways to decide their outcome. We examined four dif-
ferent voting methods in some detail, but there are many others that we don’t 
have time to discuss (a few are mentioned in the exercises). So now comes a 
different but fundamental question (that may have already crossed your mind): 
Of all those voting methods out there, which one is the best? As 
simple as it sounds, this question has vexed social scientists and 
mathematicians for centuries, going back to Condorcet and 
Borda in the mid 1700s. For multi-candidate elections (three 
or more candidates) there is no good answer. In fact, we now 
know that there are limitations to all voting methods. This 
is a very important and famous discovery known as Arrow’s
Impossibility Theorem. In this section we will discuss the basic ideas 
behind this theorem.
In the late 1940s the American economist Kenneth Arrow 
turned the question of finding an ideal voting method on its head 
and asked himself the following: What would it take for a voting 
method to at least be a fair voting method? To answer this question 
Arrow set forth a minimum set of requirements that we will call Ar-
row’s fairness criteria. (In all fairness, Arrow’s original formulation 
was quite a bit more complicated than the one we present here. The 
list below is a simplified version.)
n The majority criterion. A majority candidate (i.e., a candidate with a majority of 
the first place votes) should always be the winner.
n The Condorcet criterion. A Condorcet candidate (i.e., a candidate that beats 
each of the other candidates in a pairwise comparison) should always be the 
winner.
n The monotonicity criterion. If candidate X is the winner, then X would still be 
the winner had a voter ranked X higher in his preference ballot. (In other 
words, a voter should not be able to hurt the winner by moving him up in his 
ballot.)
n The independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives (iia) criterion. If candidate X is the 
winner, then X would still be the winner had one or more of the irrelevant 
alternatives (i.e., losing candidates) not been in the race. (In other words, the 
winner should not be hurt by the elimination from the election of irrelevant 
alternatives.)
The above fairness criteria represent some (not necessarily all) of the basic prin-
ciples we expect a democratic election to satisfy and can be used as a benchmark 
by which we can measure any voting method. If a method violates any one of these 
criteria, then there is the potential for unfair results under that method.
between the number of candidates and the number of pairwise comparisons. The 
general relation is given by the following useful formula:
Number of candidates = N 1 Number of pairwise comparisons = N(N - 1)/2

Essentially what happened in Example 19 is that although a majority of the vot-
ers had A as their first choice there were also many voters that had A as their last 
choice (voters either loved A or hated A). Candidate B, on the other hand, was more 
of a compromise candidate—few first-place votes but enough second- and third-
place votes to make a difference and beat A. It is not hard to see how similar viola-
tions of the majority criterion might often happen under the Borda count method.
The next set of examples illustrates how violations of the different fairness cri-
teria might occur.
example 19  The borda CounT violaTes The majoriTy CriTerion
Table 18 shows the preference 
schedule for a small election. 
The majority candidate in this 
election is A with 6 out of 11 
first-place votes, but the winner 
under the Borda count method is 
B (32 points to A’s 29 points).

ple 9 for the details), but the win-
ner under the plurality method is 
the Rose Bowl.

The monoToniCiTy CriTerion
This example comes in two parts—a before and an after. The “before” part shows 
how the voters intend to vote just before they cast their ballots. Table 20(a) shows 
the preference schedule for the “before” election. If all voters vote exactly as shown 
in Table 20(a), C will be the winner under the plurality-with-elimination method 
(B is eliminated in the first round and the 8 votes for B get transferred to C in the 
second round).
Example 20 illustrates how, by disregarding the voters’ preferences other than 
first choice, the plurality method can end up choosing a clearly inferior candidate 
(the Rose Bowl) over a Condorcet candidate (the Hula Bowl).
23

The Mathematics of Elections
Now imagine that just before the ballots are cast the two voters represented by 
the last column of Table 20(a) decide to move C from second place to first place on 
their ballots. This is a change favorable to C, and we would not expect it to change 
the outcome (as C would have won anyway). But now the preference schedule looks 
like Table 20(b). In this election A is eliminated in the first round, the 7 votes for A 
are transferred to B, and B wins the election!
Looking at Example 21 in retrospect we can say that C lost the election because 
of too many first-place votes! (Had C been able to talk two of his supporters into 
placing him in second place and A in first place he would have won the election.) 
This kind of perverse reversal of electoral fortunes is what the monotonicity crite-
rion seeks to prevent. When the monotonicity criterion is not satisfied we can imag-
ine candidates campaigning not to get too many first-place votes!
example 22  pairWise Comparisons violaTes The iia
This example is a continuation of 
Example 18 (The NFL Draft). 
Table 21 is a repeat of Table 15.  
We saw in Example 18 that the 
winner of the election under the 
method of pairwise comparisons 
is Allen (you may want to go back 
and refresh your memory). The 
LAXers are prepared to make  
Allen their number-one draft choice 
and offer him a big contract. Allen is 
happy. End of story? Not quite.
Just before the announcement is 
made, it is discovered that one of the irrelevant alternatives (Castillo) should not have 
been included in the list of candidates. (Nobody had bothered to tell the draft com-
mittee that Castillo had failed the team physical!) So, Castillo is removed from the 
preference schedule and everything is recalculated. The new preference schedule is now 
shown in Table 22 (it is Table 21 after C is removed). Table 23 shows the result of the 
six pairwise comparisons between Allen, Byers, Dixon, and Evans. We can see that 
the winner of the election is now Byers! Other than Byers, nobody is happy!

The Mathematics of Elections
Example 22 illustrates a typical violation of the IIA: The elimination of an irrel-
evant alternative (Castillo) penalized Allen and made him lose an election he would 
have otherwise won and rewarded Byers, allowing him to win an election he would 
have otherwise lost. Clearly this is not fair, and the independence of irrelevant alter-
natives criterion aims to prevent these types of situations.
The point of the four preceding exam-
ples is to illustrate the fact that each of the 
voting methods we studied in this chap-
ter violates one of Arrow’s fairness crite-
ria. In fact, some of the voting methods 
violate more than one criterion. The full 
story of which fairness criteria are violated 
by each voting method is summarized in  
Table 24. (For examples illustrating some 
of the other violations shown in Table 24 
see Exercises 51 through 55.)
If you are looking at Table 24 and ask-
ing yourself “So what’s the point? Why did 
we spend so much time learning about voting methods that are so flawed?” you have 
a legitimate gripe. The problem is that we don’t have better options—every voting 
method is flawed. This remarkable fact was discovered in 1949 by Kenneth Arrow 
and is known as Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem. To be more precise, Arrow dem-
onstrated that for elections involving three or more candidates it is mathematically 
impossible for a voting method to satisfy all four of his fairness criteria.
In one sense, Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem is a bit of a downer. It tells us that 
no matter how hard we try democracy will never have a perfectly fair voting method 
and that the potential for unfairness is built into every election. This does not mean 
that every election is unfair or that every voting method is equally bad, nor does it 
mean that we should stop trying to improve the quality of our voting experience.

Elections are the mechanism that allows us to make social decisions in a democracy. 
(In contrast to a dictatorship, where social decisions are made by one individual and 
elections are either meaningless or nonexistent.) The purpose of this chapter is to 
help you see elections in a new light.
In this chapter we discussed many important concepts, including preference bal-
lots, preference schedules, winner-only versus ranked elections, voting methods, and 
fairness criteria. We saw plenty of examples of elections—some made-up, some real. 
Conclusion
25

The Mathematics of Elections
 n Elections are ubiquitous. The general public tends to think of elections mostly 
in terms of political decisions (president, governor, mayor, city council, etc.), 
but elections are behind almost every meaningful social decision made outside 
the political arena—Academy Awards, American Idol, Heisman Trophy, MVP 
awards, Homecoming Queen, where to go to dinner, etc.
 n There are many different voting methods. The outcome of an election can be de-
termined in many different ways. In this chapter we discussed in some detail only 
four methods: plurality, Borda count, plurality-with-elimination, and pairwise 
comparisons. By no means do these four exhaust the list—there are many other 
voting methods, some quite elaborate and exotic (see, for example, Exercise 70).
 n Different voting methods can produce different outcomes. We saw an extreme 
illustration of this with the Math Club election: each of the four voting methods 
produced a different winner. Since there were four candidates, we can say that 
each of them won the election (just pick the “right” voting method). Of course, 
this doesn’t happen all the time and there are many situations where different 
voting methods produce the same outcome.
 n Fairness in voting is elusive. For a voting method to be considered fair there are 
certain basic criteria that it should consistently satisfy. These are called fairness 
criteria. We introduced four in this chapter (majority, Condorcet, monotonic-
ity, and independence of irrelevant alternatives), but there are others (see, for 
example, Exercises 71 and 72). Each fairness criterion represents a basic prin-
ciple we expect a democratic election to satisfy. When a voting method violates 
any one of these criteria then there is the potential for unfair results under that 
method. All of the voting methods we discussed in this chapter violate at least 
one (sometimes several) of the criteria, and there is a good reason why: for 
elections with three or more candidates it is mathematically impossible for any 
voting method to satisfy all four fairness criteria. This is a simpli-
fied version of Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem.
One concluding thought about this chapter. One should not inter-
pret Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem to mean that democracy is 
bad and that elections are pointless. The lesson to be learned from 
Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem is that no voting system is perfect, 
because there are some built-in limitations to the process of mak-
ing decisions in a democracy. This knowledge was made possible 
through the power of mathematical ideas.
,,
The search of the great minds of 
recorded history for the perfect 
democracy, it turns out, is the search 
for a chimera, a logical  
self-contradiction.
– Paul Samuelson

key ConCepTs
1 The Basic Elements of an Election
n single-choice ballot: a ballot in which a voter only has to choose one candidate
n preference ballot: a ballot in which the voter has to rank all candidates in order of 
preference
n truncated preference ballot: a ballot in which a voter only has to rank the top k 
choices rather than all the choices
We learned same specific skills such as interpreting a preference schedule and com-
puting the outcome of an election under four different voting methods and varia-
tions thereof.
Beyond the specific concepts and skills, there were several important general 
themes that ran through the chapter:
26
www.ebook3000.com

The Mathematics of Elections
n ranking (full ranking): in an election, an outcome that lists all the candidates in 
order of preference (first, second, . . . , last)
n partial ranking: in an election, an outcome where just the top k candidates are 
ranked
n preference schedule: a table that summarizes the preference ballots of all the voters
2 The Plurality Method
n plurality method: a voting method that ranks candidates based on the number of first-
place votes they receive
n insincere voting: voting for candidates in a manner other than the voter’s real prefer-
ence with the purpose of manipulating the outcome of the election
n Condorcet candidate: a candidate that beats all the other candidates in pairwise 
comparisons
3 The Borda Count Method
n borda count method: a voting method that assigns points to positions on the ballot 
and ranks candidates according to the number of points
4 The Plurality-with-Elimination Method
n plurality-with-elimination method: a voting method that chooses the candidate with 
a majority of the votes; when there isn’t one it eliminates the candidate(s) with the least 
votes and transfers those votes to the next highest candidate on those ballots, continuing 
this way until there is a majority candidate
n instant-runoff voting: a variation of the plurality-with-elimination method based on 
truncated preference ballots
5 The Method of Pairwise Comparisons
n method of pairwise comparisons: a voting method based on head-to-head compari-
sons between candidates that assigns one point to the winner of each comparison, 
none to the loser, and 1
2 point to each of the two candidates in case of a tie
6 Fairness Criteria and Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem
n fairness criteria: basic rules that define formal requirements for fairness—a fair vot-
ing method should always satisfy these basic rules
n majority criterion: a fairness criterion that says that when a candidate receives a ma-
jority of the first-place votes, that candidate should be the winner of the election
n Condorcet criterion: a fairness criterion that says that when there is a Condorcet can-
didate then that candidate should be the winner of the election 
n monotonicity criterion: a fairness criterion that says that a candidate that would other-
wise win an election should not lose the election merely because some voters changed 
their ballots in a manner that favors that candidate
n independence-of-irrelevant-alternatives criterion: a criterion that says that a candidate 
that would otherwise win an election should not lose the election merely because one 
of the losing candidates withdraws from the race
n arrow’s impossibility Theorem: a theorem that demonstrates that a voting meth-
od that is guaranteed to always produce fair outcomes is a mathematical impos-
sibility

Exercises 3 through 6 refer to an alternative format for preference 
ballots in which the names of the candidates appear on the ballot 
and the voter is asked to put a rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) next to each name 
[see Fig. 1(c)]. (This alternative format makes it easier on the vot-

The Mathematics of Elections
 16. Table 36 shows the preference schedule for an election with 
five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). The number of voters 
in this election was very large, so the columns of the pref-
erence schedule give the percent of voters instead of the 
number of voters. Use the plurality method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 13. Table 33 shows the preference schedule for an election with 
four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use the plurality method 
to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 17. Table 29 (see Exercise 7) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). In 
this election ties are not allowed to stand, and the follow-
ing tie-breaking rule is used: Whenever there is a tie between 
candidates, the tie is broken in favor of the candidate with the 
fewer last-place votes. Use the plurality method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 18. Table 30 (see Exercise 8) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). In 
this election ties are not allowed to stand, and the follow-

(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 19. Table 29 (see Exercise 7) shows the preference schedule for an 
election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). In this election 
ties are not allowed to stand, and the following tie-breaking rule 
is used: Whenever there is a tie between two candidates, the tie 
is broken in favor of the winner of a head-to-head comparison 
between the candidates. Use the plurality method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 20. Table 30 (see Exercise 8) shows the preference schedule for 
an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). In this elec-
tion ties are not allowed to stand, and the following tie-breaking 
rule is used: Whenever there is a tie between two candidates, the

Find the ranking of the top 5 finalists and the number of 
points each one received (see Example 12).
 3 borda Count
 21. Table 31 (see Exercise 11) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the Borda count method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 22. Table 32 (see Exercise 12) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the Borda count method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 23. Table 33 (see Exercise 13) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the Borda count method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 24. Table 34 (see Exercise 14) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the Borda count method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 25. Table 35 (see Exercise 15) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). The 
number of voters in this election was very large, so the col-
umns of the preference schedule give the percent of voters 
instead of the number of voters. Use the Borda count method  
to find the complete ranking of the candidates. (Hint: The 
ranking does not depend on the number of voters, so you can 
pick any convenient number to use for the number of voters.)
 26. Table 36 (see Exercise 16) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). The 
number of voters in this election was very large, so the col-
umns of the preference schedule give the percent of voters 
instead of the number of voters. Use the Borda count method  
to find the complete ranking of the candidates. (Hint: The 
ranking does not depend on the number of voters, so you can 
pick any convenient number to use for the number of voters.)
 27. The 2009 heisman award. Table 37 shows the results of 
the balloting for the 2009 Heisman Award. Find the ranking 
of the top four finalists and the number of points each one 
received (see Example 11).
 29. An election was held using the Borda count method. There 
were four candidates (A, B, C, and D) and 110 voters. 
When the points were tallied (using 4 points for first, 3 
points for second, 2 points for third, and 1 point for fourth), 
A had 320 points, B had 290 points, and C had 180 points. 
Find how many points D had and give the ranking of the 
candidates. (Hint: Figure out how many points are packed 
in each ballot.)
 30. An election was held using the following variation of the 
Borda count method: 7 points for first-place, 4 points for 
second, 3 points for third, 2 points for fourth, and 1 point 
for fifth. There were five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E) 
and 30 voters. When the points were tallied A had 84 
points, B had 65 points, C had 123 points, and D had 107 
points. Find how many points E had and give the ranking 
of the candidates. (Hint: Figure out how many points are 
packed in each ballot.)
 4 plurality-with-elimination
 31. Table 31 (see Exercise 11) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the plurality-with-elimination method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 32. Table 32 (see Exercise 12) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the plurality-with-elimination method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.

The Mathematics of Elections
 38. Table 40 shows the preference schedule for an election 
with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). Find the com-
plete ranking of the candidates using the plurality-with- 
elimination method.
Top-Two IRV. Exercises 39 and 40 refer to a simple variation of the 
plurality-with-elimination method called top-two IRV. This method 
works for winner-only elections. Instead of eliminating candidates 
one at a time, we eliminate all the candidates except the top two in the 
first round and transfer their votes to the two remaining candidates.
 39. Find the winner of the election given by Table 39 using the 
top-two IRV method.
 40. Find the winner of the election given by Table 40 using the 
top-two IRV method.
 34. Table 34 (see Exercise 14) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the plurality-with-elimination method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 35. Table 35 (see Exercise 15) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). 
The number of voters in this election was very large, so the 
columns of the preference schedule give the percent of vot-
ers instead of the number of voters. Use the plurality-with-
elimination method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 36. Table 36 (see Exercise 16) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). 
The number of voters in this election was very large, so 
the columns of the preference schedule give the percent of  
voters instead of the number of voters. Use the plurality-
with-elimination method to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 37. Table 39 shows the preference schedule for an election 
with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). Find the com-
plete ranking of the candidates using the plurality-with- 
elimination method.
 5 pairwise Comparisons
 41. Table 31 (see Exercise 11) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the method of pairwise comparisons to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 42. Table 32 (see Exercise 12) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the method of pairwise comparisons to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 43. Table 33 (see Exercise 13) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the method of pairwise comparisons to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 44. Table 34 (see Exercise 14) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with four candidates (A, B, C, and D). Use 
the method of pairwise comparisons to
 
(a) find the winner of the election.
 
(b) find the complete ranking of the candidates.
 45. Table 35 (see Exercise 15) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). 
The number of voters in this election was very large, so the 
columns of the preference schedule give the percent of vot-
ers instead of the number of voters. Find the winner of the 
election using the method of pairwise comparisons.
 46. Table 36 (see Exercise 16) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E). 
The number of voters in this election was very large, so the 
columns of the preference schedule give the percent of vot-
ers instead of the number of voters. Find the winner of the 
election using the method of pairwise comparisons.
 47. Table 39 (see Exercise 37) shows the preference schedule for 
an election with 5 candidates. Find the complete ranking of 
the candidates using the method of pairwise comparisons. 
(Assume that ties are broken using the results of the pairwise 
comparisons between the tying candidates.)

The Mathematics of Elections
 54. Use the Math Club election (Example 10) to illustrate why 
the Borda count method violates the IIA criterion. (Hint: 
Find the winner, then eliminate D and see what happens.)
 55. Use Table 43 to illustrate why the plurality-with-elimination 
method violates the IIA criterion. (Hint: Find the winner, 
then eliminate C and see what happens.)
 48. Table 40 (see Exercise 38) shows the preference schedule 
for an election with 5 candidates. Find the complete ranking 
of the candidates using the method of pairwise comparisons.
 49. An election with five candidates (A, B, C, D, and E) is de-
cided using the method of pairwise comparisons. If B loses 
two pairwise comparisons, C loses one, D loses one and ties 
one, and E loses two and ties one,
 
(a) find how many pairwise comparisons A loses.
 
(b) find the winner of the election.
 50. An election with six candidates (A, B, C, D, E, and F) is de-
cided using the method of pairwise comparisons. If A loses 
four pairwise comparisons, B and C both lose three, D loses 
one and ties one, and E loses two and ties one,
 
(a) find how many pairwise comparisons F loses. (Hint: 
First compute the total number of pairwise compari-
sons for six candidates.)
 
(b) find the winner of the election.
 56. Explain why the method of pairwise comparisons satisfies 
the majority criterion.
 57. Explain why the method of pairwise comparisons satisfies 
the Condorcet criterion.
 58. Explain why the plurality method satisfies the monotonicity 
criterion.
 59. Explain why the Borda count method satisfies the monoto-
nicity criterion.
 60. Explain why the method of pairwise comparisons satisfies 
the monotonicity criterion.

 61. Two-candidate elections. Explain why when there are 
only two candidates, the four voting methods we discussed 
in this chapter give the same winner and the winner is  
determined by straight majority. (Assume that there are  
no ties.)
 62. equivalent borda count (variation 1). The following simple 
variation of the Borda count method is sometimes used: A 
first place is worth N - 1 points, second place is worth N - 2 
points, . . ., last place is worth 0 points (where N is the num-
ber of candidates). Explain why this variation is equivalent 
to the original Borda count described in this chapter (i.e., it 
produces exactly the same election results).
 63. equivalent borda count (variation 2). Another commonly 
used variation of the Borda count method is the following: A 
first place is worth 1 point, second place is worth 2 points, . . . , 
last place is worth N points (where N is the number of can-
didates). The candidate with the fewest points is the win-
ner, second fewest points is second, and so on. Explain 
why this variation is equivalent to the original Borda count 
described in this chapter (i.e., it produces exactly the same 
election results).
 64. The average ranking. The average ranking of a candidate is 
obtained by taking the place of the candidate on each of the 
ballots, adding these numbers, and dividing by the number 
of ballots. Explain why the candidate with the best (lowest) 
average ranking is the Borda winner.

Coombs method.
 
(b) Give an example that illustrates why the Coombs 
method violates the Condorcet criterion.

 70. bucklin voting. (This method was used in the early part of 
the 20th century to determine winners of many elections 
for political office in the United States.) The method pro-
ceeds in rounds. Round 1: Count first-place votes only. 
If a candidate has a majority of the first-place votes, that 
candidate wins. Otherwise, go to the next round. Round 2: 
Count first- and second-place votes only. If there are any 
candidates with a majority of votes, the candidate with the 
most votes wins. Otherwise, go to the next round. Round 3: 
Count first-, second-, and third-place votes only. If there are 
any candidates with a majority of votes, the candidate with 
the most votes wins. Otherwise, go to the next round. Re-
peat for as many rounds as necessary.
 
(a) Find the winner of the Math Club election using the 
Bucklin method.
 
(b) Give an example that illustrates why the Bucklin method 
violates the Condorcet criterion.
 
(c) Explain why the Bucklin method satisfies the monoto-
nicity criterion.
 65. The 2006 associated press college football poll. The AP col-
lege football poll is a ranking of the top 25 college foot-
ball teams in the country and is one of the key polls used 
for the BCS (Bowl Championship Series). The voters in 
the AP poll are a group of sportswriters and broadcast-
ers chosen from across the country. The top 25 teams are 
ranked using a Borda count: each first-place vote is worth 
25 points, each second-place vote is worth 24 points, each 
third-place vote is worth 23 points, and so on. Table 44 
shows the ranking and total points for each of the top 
three teams at the end of the 2006 regular season. (The 
remaining 22 teams are not shown here because they are 
irrelevant to this exercise.)

 74. Suppose that the following was proposed as a fairness crite-
rion: If a majority of the voters rank X above Y, then the re-
sults of the election should have X ranked above Y. Give an 
example to illustrate why all four voting methods discussed 
in the chapter can violate this criterion. (Hint: Consider an 
example with no Condorcet candidate.)
 75. Consider a variation of the Borda count method in which a 
first-place vote in an election with N candidates is worth F 
points (where F 7 N) and all other places in the ballot are 
the same as in the ordinary Borda count: N - 1 points for 
second place, N - 2 points for third place, . . . , 1 point for 
last place. By choosing F large enough, we can make this 
variation of the Borda count method satisfy the majority 
criterion. Find the smallest value of F (expressed in terms 
of N) for which this happens.

 71. The pareto criterion. The following fairness criterion was 
proposed by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848–
1923): If every voter prefers candidate X to candidate Y, then 
X should be ranked above Y.
 
(a) Explain why the Borda count method satisfies the 
Pareto criterion.
 
(b) Explain why the pairwise-comparisons method satis-
fies the Pareto criterion.
 72. The Condorcet loser criterion. If there is a candidate who 
loses in a one-to-one comparison to each of the other can-
didates, then that candidate should not be the winner of the 
election. (This fairness criterion is a sort of mirror image of 
the regular Condorcet criterion.)
 
(a) Give an example that illustrates why the plurality 
method violates the Condorcet loser criterion.
 
(b) Give an example that illustrates why the plurality-with-
elimination method violates the Condorcet loser criterion.
 
(c) Explain why the Borda count method satisfies the 
Condorcet loser criterion.
 73. Consider the following fairness criterion: If a majority of the 
voters have candidate X ranked last, then candidate X should 
not be a winner of the election.
 1 ballots, ballots, ballots!
In this chapter we discussed elections in which the voters cast 
their votes by means of preference ballots. There are many other 
types of ballots used in real-life elections, ranging from the sim-
ple (winner only) to the exotic (each voter has a fixed number 
of points to divide among the candidates any way he or she sees 
fit). In this project you are to research other types of ballots; 
how, where, and when they are used; and what are the argu-
ments for and against their use.
 2 instant runoff voting
Imagine that you are a political activist in your community. The city 
council is having hearings to decide if the method of instant runoff 
voting (plurality-with-elimination) should be adopted in your city. 
Stake out a position for or against instant runoff voting and prepare 
a brief to present to the city council that justifies that position. To 
make an effective case, your argument should include mathematical, 
economic, political, and social considerations. (Remember that your 
city council members are not as well versed as you are in the math-
ematical aspects of elections. Part of your job is to educate them.)
 3 The 2000 presidential election 
  
and the Florida vote
The unusual circumstances surrounding the 2000 presidential 
election and the Florida vote are a low point in American elec-
toral history. Write an analysis paper on the 2000 Florida vote, 
paying particular attention to what went wrong and how a simi-
lar situation can be prevented in the future. You should touch 
on technology issues (outdated and inaccurate vote-tallying 
methods and equipment, poorly designed ballots, etc.), political 
issues (the two-party system, the Electoral College, etc.), and, as 
much as possible, on issues related to concepts from this chapter 
(can presidential elections be improved by changing to prefer-
ence ballots, using a different voting method, etc.).
 4 short story
Write a fictional short story using an election as the backdrop. 
Weave into the dramatic structure of the story elements and 
themes from this chapter (fairness, manipulation, monotonicity, 
and independence of irrelevant alternatives all lend themselves 
to good drama). Be creative and have fun.

 61. Suppose that A gets a first-place votes and B gets b first-place votes, 
where a 7 b. It is clear that candidate A wins the election under 
the plurality method, the plurality-with-elimination method, and the 
method of pairwise comparisons. Under the Borda count method,  
A gets 2a + b points while B gets 2b + a points. Since a 7 b, 
2a + b 7 2b + a, and so again A wins the election.

  (b) A is a Condorcet candidate but is eliminated in the first round.
  (c)  B wins under the Coombs method. However, if 8 voters move B 
from their third choice to their second choice, then C wins.
63. The number of points under this variation is complementary to the 
number of points under the standard Borda count method: A first 
place is worth 1 point instead of N, a second place is worth 2 points 
instead of N - 1, . . . , a last place is worth N points instead of 1. It 
follows that having the fewest points here is equivalent to having 
the most points under the standard Borda count method, having the 
second fewest is equivalent to having the second most, and so on.

Weighted Voting
In a democracy we take many things for granted, not the least of 
which is the idea that we are all equal. When it comes to voting, 
the democratic ideal of equality translates into the principle of 
one person–one vote. But is the principle of one person–one vote 
always fair? Should one person–one vote apply when the voters are 
institutions or governments, rather than individuals? 
40

n a diverse society, voters—be they individuals or institutions—are some-
times not equal, and sometimes it is actually desirable to recognize their 
differences by giving them different amounts of say over the outcome of 
the voting. This is the exact opposite of the principle of one voter–one 
vote, a principle best described as one voter–x votes and formally called weighted 
voting (the word “weight” here refers to the number of votes controlled by a voter, 
and not to pounds or kilograms).
Weighted voting is not uncommon—we see examples of weighted voting in 
shareholder votes in corporations, in business partnerships, in legislatures, in the 
United Nations Security Council, and in the Electoral College.
The Electoral College, that uniquely American institution used to elect the 
President of the United States, offers a classic illustration of weighted voting. The 
Electoral College consists of 51 “voters” (each of the 50 states plus the District of 
Columbia), each with a weight determined by the size of its Congressional delegation 
(number of Representatives and Senators). At one end of the spectrum is heavy-
weight California (55 electoral votes); at the other end of the spectrum are small 
states (in population) like Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and the District of 
Columbia (3 electoral votes).
Since the point of weighted voting is to give different voters different amounts 
of influence in the outcome of the voting (i.e., different amounts of power),  
the key question we will discuss in this chapter is how 
does one go about measuring a voter’s power in a 
weighted voting situation? We will answer this ques-
tion not once but twice, and in so doing cover some 
new and interesting mathematics.
Section 1 will introduce and illustrate the concept 
of a weighted voting system, a formal way to describe 
most weighted voting situations. We will learn about 
weights, quotes, dictators, and veto power. Section 2 
deals with what is known as the Banzhaf measure of power. Here we will learn 
about coalitions, critical players, and dummies. Section 3 deals with what is known 
as the Shapley-Shubik measure of power. Here we will learn about sequential coali-
tions, pivotal players, and factorials. Section 4 is essentially a mathematical detour 
where we will learn about counting subsets and permutations.

The Mathematics of Power
We will use the term weighted voting system to describe any formal voting ar-
rangement in which voters are not necessarily equal in terms of the number of 
votes they control. In this chapter we will only consider voting on yes–no votes, 
known as motions. Note that any vote between two choices (say A or B) can be 
rephrased as a yes–no vote (a Yes is a vote for A, a No is a vote for B).
Every weighted voting system is characterized by three elements:
n The players. We will refer to the voters in a weighted voting system as the players.
The players may be individuals, but they may also be institutions (corporations, 
governmental agencies, states, municipalities, or countries). We will use N to 
denote the number of players in a weighted voting system, and typically (unless 
there is a good reason not to) we will call the players P1, P2, c, PN. (Think of 
P1 as short for “player 1,” P2 as short for “player 2,” etc.)
n The weights. The hallmark of a weighted voting system is that each player con-
trols a certain number of votes, called the weight of the player. We will assume 
that the weights are all positive integers, and we will use w1, w2, c, wN to
denote the weights of P1, P2, c, PN, respectively. We will use V to de-
note the total number of votes in the system 1V = w1 + w2 + g+ wN2. A 
weighted voting system is only interesting when the weights are not all the 
same, but in principle we do not preclude the possibility that the weights 
are all equal.
n The quota. In addition to the players’ weights, every weighted voting system has 
a quota. The quota is the minimum number of votes required to pass a motion, 
and is denoted by the letter q. While the most common standard for the quota 
is a simple majority of the votes, the quota may very well be something else. In 
the U.S. Senate, for example, it takes a simple majority to pass an ordinary law, 
but it takes a minimum of 60 votes to stop a filibuster, and it takes a minimum of 
two-thirds of the votes to override a presidential veto. In other weighted voting 
systems the rules may stipulate a quota of three-fourths of the votes, or four-
fifths, or even unanimity (100% of the votes).
Notation and Examples
The standard notation used to describe a weighted voting system is to use square 
brackets and inside the square brackets to write the quota q first (followed by a co-
lon) and then the respective weights of the individual players separated by commas. 
It is convenient and customary to list the weights in numerical order, starting with 
the highest, and we will adhere to this convention throughout the chapter.
Thus, a generic weighted voting system with N players can be written as: 
3q: w1, w2, c, wN4 (with w1 Ú w2 Ú gÚ wN)
We will now look at a few examples to illustrate some basic concepts in weighted  
voting.
An Introduction to Weighted Voting
Four partners (P1, P2, P3, and P4) decide to start a new business venture. In order
to raise the $200,000 venture capital needed for startup money, they issue 20 shares 
worth $10,000 each. Suppose that P1 buys 8 shares, P2 buys 7 shares, P3 buys
3 shares, and P4 buys 2 shares, with the usual agreement that one share equals one 
vote in the partnership. Suppose that the quota is set to be two-thirds of the total 
number of votes.

The Mathematics of Power
Given that we expect our weighted voting systems to operate without anarchy 
or gridlock, from here on we will assume that the quota will always fall somewhere 
between simple majority and unanimity of votes. Symbolically, we can express 
these requirements by two inequalities: q 7 V>2 and q … V. These two restrictions
define the range of possible values of the quota:
V>2 6 q … V (where V = w1 +w2 + g+ wN)
The surprising conclusion of Example 4 is that the weighted voting system 
319: 8, 7, 3, 24 describes a one person–one vote situation in disguise. This seems 
like a contradiction only if we think of one person–one vote as implying that all 
players have an equal number of votes rather than an equal say in the outcome of 
the election. Apparently, these two things are not the same! As Example 4 makes 
Imagine the same partnership discussed in Example 1, with the only difference 
being that the quota is changed to 10 votes. We might be tempted to think of this 
partnership as the weighted voting system 310: 8, 7, 3, 24, but there is a problem 
here: the quota is too small, making it possible for both Yes’s and No’s to have 
enough votes to carry a particular motion. (Imagine, for example, that an impor-
tant decision needs to be made and P1 and P4 vote yes and P2 and P3 vote no. Now 
we have a stalemate, since both the Yes’s and the No’s have enough votes to meet 
the quota.)
In general when the quota requirement is less than simple majority we have the 
potential for both Yes’s and No’s to win—a mathematical version of anarchy.
ExamplE 2  aNarChy
Let’s consider the partnership introduced in Example 1 one final time. This time 
the quota is set to be q = 19. Here we can describe the partnership as the weighted 
voting system 319: 8, 7, 3, 24. What’s interesting about this weighted voting system 
is that the only way a motion can pass is by the unanimous support of all the players. 
(Note that P1, P2, and P3 together have 18 votes—they still need P4’s votes to pass a 
motion.) In this weighted voting system all four players have the same power. Even 
though P4 has only 2 votes, his ability to influence the outcome of the vote is exactly 
the same as that of P1, with 8 votes. In a practical sense this weighted voting system 
is no different from a weighted voting system in which each partner has just one 
vote and it takes the unanimous agreement of the four partners to pass a motion 
(i.e., 34: 1, 1, 1, 14).
ExamplE 4  FEw VoTEs, muCh powEr
Once again, let’s look at the partnership introduced in Example 1, but suppose 
now that the quota is set to q = 21, more than the total number of votes in the 
system. This would not make much sense. Under these conditions no motion 
would ever pass and nothing could ever get done—a mathematical version of 
gridlock.
ExamplE 3  GridloCk
Since the total number of votes in the partnership is V =  20, and two-thirds 
of 20 is 131
3, the actual quota is q = 14. Using the weighted voting system no-
tation we just introduced, the partnership can be described mathematically as 
314: 8, 7, 3, 24.

The Mathematics of Power
abundantly clear, just looking at the number of votes a player owns can be very 
deceptive.
n dictator. A player is a dictator if and only if the player’s weight is bigger than 
or equal to the quota. Since there can only be one dictator, and since the player 
with the highest weight is P1, we can conclude that if there is a dictator, then it must 
be P1. Mathematically speaking, a weighted voting system with a dictator is not 
very interesting, since all the power is concentrated in the hands of one player. 
For the rest of this chapter we will restrict our attention to weighted voting 
systems where there are no dictators.
Consider the weighted voting system 311: 12, 5, 44. Here one of the players 1P12 
owns enough votes to carry a motion singlehandedly. In this situation P1 is in com-
plete control—if P1 is for the motion, then the motion will pass; if P1 is against it, 
then the motion will fail. Clearly, in terms of the power to influence decisions, P1 has 
all of it. Not surprisingly, we will say that P1 is a dictator. 
ExamplE 6   diCTaTors
Four college friends 1P1, P2, P3, and P42 decide to go into business together. Three 
of the four 1P1, P2, and P32 invest $10,000 each, and each gets 10 shares in the 
partnership. The fourth partner 1P42 is a little short on cash, so he invests only 
$9,000 and gets 9 shares. As usual, one share equals one vote. The quota is set at 
75%, which here means q = 30 out of a total of V = 39 votes. Mathematically (i.e., 
stripped of all the irrelevant details of the story), this partnership is just the weighted 
voting system 330: 10, 10, 10, 94.
Everything seems fine with the partnership until one day P4 wakes up to the 
realization that with the quota set at q = 30 he is completely out of the decision-
making loop: For a motion to pass P1, P2, and P3 all must vote Yes, and at that point 
it makes no difference how P4 votes. Thus, there is never going to be a time when
P4’s votes are going to make a difference in the final outcome of a business decision.
ExamplE 5   maNy VoTEs, liTTlE powEr
In general we will say that a player who is not a dictator has veto power if a 
motion cannot pass unless the player votes in favor of the motion. In other words, a 
player with veto power cannot force a motion to pass (the player is not a dictator) 
but can force a motion to fail. If we let w denote the weight of a player with veto 
power, then the two conditions can be expressed mathematically by the inequalities 
w 6 q (the player is not a dictator) and V - w 6 q (the remaining votes in the system 
are not enough to pass a motion).
Consider the weighted voting system 312: 9, 5, 4, 24. Here P1 plays the role of a 
“spoiler”—without the support of P1 a motion can’t pass. This happens because if 
we remove P1’s 9 votes the sum of the remaining votes 15 + 4 + 2 = 112 is less than 
the quota q = 12. Thus, even if all the other players voted Yes, without P1 the mo-
tion would not pass. In a situation like this we say that P1 has veto power.

n Veto power. A player with weight w has veto power if and only if w 6 q and 
V - w 6 q (where V = w1 + w2 + g+ wN).

The Mathematics of Power
From the preceding set of examples we can already draw an important lesson: 
In weighted voting the players’ weights can be deceiving. Sometimes a player 
can have a few votes and yet have as much power as a player with many more 
votes (see Example 4); sometimes two players have almost an equal number of 
votes, and yet one player has a lot of power and the other one has none (see  
Example 5).
To pursue these ideas further we will need a formal definition of what “power” 
means and how it can be measured. In this section we will introduce a mathematical 
method for measuring the power of the players in a weighted voting system. This 
method was first proposed in 1965 by, of all people, a law professor named John 
Banzhaf III. Banzhaf is a Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington 
University, and the founder and executive director of the national antismoking 
group Action on Smoking and Health. Banzhaf was just 25 years old when he first 
came up with the ideas we will discuss in this section. 
We start our discussion of Banzhaf’s method with an application to the U.S. 
Senate. The circumstances are fictitious, but given party politics these days, not very 
far-fetched.
Before we continue with Example 8, we will introduce some important new 
concepts.
n Coalition. We will use the term coalition to describe any set of players who 
might join forces and vote the same way. In principle, we can have a coalition 
with as few as one player and as many as all players. The coalition consisting of 
all the players is called the grand coalition. Since coalitions are just sets of play-
ers, the most convenient way to describe coalitions mathematically is to use set 
notation. For example, the coalition consisting of players P1, P2, and P3 can be 
written as the set 5P1, P2, P36 (but also as 5P3, P1, P26, 5P2, P1, P36, etc.—the 
order in which the members of a coalition are listed is irrelevant).
The U.S. Senate has 100 members, and a simple majority of 51 votes is required 
to pass a bill. Suppose the Senate is composed of 49 Republicans, 48 Democrats,  
and 3 Independents, and that Senators vote strictly along party lines— 
Republicans all vote the same way, so do Democrats, and even the Independents 
are sticking together.
Under this scenario the Senate behaves as the weighted voting system 
351: 49, 48, 34. The three players are the Republican party (49 votes), the Demo-
cratic party (48 votes), and the Independents (3 votes).
There are only four ways that a bill can pass:
n All players vote Yes. The bill passes unanimously, 100 to 0.
n Republicans and Democrats vote Yes; Independents vote No. The bill passes 97 
to 3.
n Republicans and Independents vote Yes; Democrats vote No. The bill passes 52 
to 48.
n Democrats and Independents vote Yes; Republicans vote No. The bill passes 51 
to 49.
That’s it! There is no other way that a bill can pass this Senate. The key obser-
vation now is that the Independents have as much influence on the outcome of the 
vote as the Republicans or the Democrats (as long as they stick together): To pass, 
a bill needs the support of any two out of the three parties.

n winning coalition. Some coalitions have enough votes to win and some don’t. 
Quite naturally, we call the former winning coalitions and the latter losing 
coalitions. Since our focus is on weighted voting systems with no dictators,
winning coalitions must have at least two players (only a dictator can be in a  
single-player winning coalition). At the other end of the spectrum, the grand 
coalition is always a winning coalition, since it controls all the votes. In some 
weighted voting systems (see Example 4) the grand coalition is the only winning 
coalition.
n Critical player. In a winning coalition a player is said to be a critical player for 
the coalition if the coalition must have that player’s votes to win. In other words, 
if we subtract a critical player’s weight from the total weight of the coalition, the 
number of remaining votes drops below the quota. In other words, P is a criti-
cal player in a winning coalition if and only if W - w 6 q (where W denotes the 
weight of the coalition and w denotes the weight of P).
n Critical count. For each player we can count the number of times that player is a 
critical player (i.e., in how many different winning coalitions the player is criti-
cal). This number is called the critical count for the player.
We now recast the analysis of the U.S. Senate [Example 8(a)] in the language 
of coalitions, critical players, and critical counts. Table 1 shows the four pos-
sible winning coalitions, their weights, and the critical players in each winning 
coalition underlined. (R represents the Republican Party with 49 votes, D rep-
resents the Democratic Party with 48 votes, and I represents the Independents 
with 3 votes.) Note that in the coalition 5R, D, I6 there are no critical players 
(any two of the three parties can pass a bill by themselves), but in the two-
player coalitions both players are critical. The critical count for R is 2 (notice 
that R is underlined twice in Table 1). In a similar manner we can check the 
critical counts for D and I—they are also 2. In short, all players have a critical 
count of 2.

We will now introduce the key concept of this section—the Banzhaf power 
index. John Banzhaf introduced this concept in 1965 in a legal dispute involving the 
Nassau County (New York) Board of Supervisors (more details in Example 13). 
Essentially, Banzhaf argued that it’s the critical count, and not the weight, that truly 
measures a player’s power—if the critical count of X is the same as the critical count 
of Y then X and Y have the same power; if the critical count of X is double that of 
Y then X has twice as much power as Y. That’s the basic idea. We formalize it with 
the following two definitions.
n The banzhaf power index (bpi). Let P1, P2, c, PN be the players in a weighted 
voting system, and B1, B2, c, BN denote their respective critical counts. Let 
T = B1 + B2 + c + BN be the total critical count. The Banzhaf power index 
(BPI) of a player is the ratio of the player’s critical count over the total critical 
count T. Using the greek letter b (“beta”) to indicate Banzhaf power indexes, 
 
we have that the BPI of P1 is b1 =
B1
T , the BPI of P2 is b2 =
B2
T , so on.
n Each Banzhaf power index is a fraction between 0 and 1 and can be expressed 
either as a fraction, a decimal, or a percent between 0 and 100. You can think of 
it as a measure of the size of a player’s share of the power.
n The banzhaf power distribution. The complete division of the “power pie” 
among the players based on their Banzhaf power indexes is called the Banzhaf 
power distribution of the weighted voting system. We describe a Banzhaf power 
distribution by simply listing the power indexes b1, b2, c, bN in order.

The Mathematics of Power
In the next set of examples we will illustrate how to carry out the above se-
quence of steps.
Some comments about the numbers in a Banzhaf power distribution. These 
numbers start out as fractions all having a common denominator T. It is not 
necessarily a good idea to reduce the fractions to their simplest form—for com-
parison purposes it is preferable to list all the fractions using a common denomi-
nator. As fractions, the numbers in the power distribution must always add up 
to 1. When T is a large number, decimals or percents provide a more convenient 
numerical description than fractions, but there is a small price to pay: when con-
verted to decimals or percents, the numbers may not add up to 1 because of 
round-off errors.
The following is a step-by-step recipe for computing the Banzhaf power distri-
bution of a weighted voting system with N players.
Of all the steps we must carry out in the process of computing Banzhaf power, 
by far the most demanding is Step 1. When we have only three players, as in Exam-
ple 9, we can list the winning coalitions on the fly—there simply aren’t that many—
but as the number of players increases, the number of possible winning coalitions 
grows rapidly, and it becomes necessary to adopt some form of strategy to come up 
Let’s find the Banzhaf power distribution of the weighted voting system 34: 3, 2, 14 
using the five-step procedure described above. The steps are also summarized in 
Table 2.
step 1. There are three winning coalitions in this weighted 
voting system. They are 5P1, P26 with 5 votes, 5P1, P36 
with 4 votes, and the grand coalition 5P1, P2, P36 with 6 
votes.
step 2. In 5P1, P26 both P1 and P2 are critical; in 5P1, P36 
both P1 and P3 are critical; in 5P1, P2, P36 only P1 is criti-
cal.
step 3. B1 = 3 (P1 is critical in three coalitions); B2 = 1 and 
B3 = 1 (P2 and P3 are critical once each).
step 4. T = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.

with a list of all the winning coalitions. This is important because if we miss a single 
one, we are in all likelihood going to get the wrong Banzhaf power distribution. One 
conservative strategy is to make a list of all possible coalitions and then cross out the 
losing ones. The next example illustrates how one would use this approach.
shortcuts for Computing banzhaf power distributions
As the number of players grows, listing all the coalitions takes a lot of effort. Some-
times we can save ourselves some of the work by figuring out directly which are the 
winning coalitions.
When NBA teams prepare for the annual draft of college players, the decision on 
which college basketball players to draft may involve many people, including the 
management, the coaches, and the scouting staff. Typically, not all these people 
have an equal voice in the process—the head coach’s opinion is worth more than 
that of an assistant coach, and the general manager’s opinion is worth more than 
that of a scout. In some cases this arrangement is formalized in the form of a 
weighted voting system. Let’s use a fictitious team—the Flyers—for the purposes 
of illustration.
In the Flyers’ draft system the head coach (P1) has 4 votes, the general man-
ager (P2) has 3 votes, the director of scouting operations (P3) has 2 votes, and the 
assistant coach (P4) has 1 vote. Of the 10 votes cast, a simple majority of 6 votes is 
required for a Yes vote on a player to be drafted. In essence, the Flyers operate as 
the weighted voting system 36: 4, 3, 2, 14.
We will now find the Banzhaf power distribution of this weighted voting system 
using Steps 1 through 5.
 
step 1. Table 3 shows a list of all possible coalitions and their weights with the 
winning coalitions followed by a check mark. (Note that the list of coalitions 
is organized systematically—two-player coalitions first, 
three-player coalitions next, etc. Also note that within 
each coalition the players are listed in numerical order 
from left to right. Both of these are good bookkeeping 
strategies, and you are encouraged to use them when you 
do your own work.)
step 2. Now we disregard the losing coalitions and go to 
work on the winning coalitions only. For each winning 
coalition we determine which players are critical. Table 
3 shows the critical players underlined. (Don’t take some-
one else’s word for it—please check that these are all the 
critical players!)
step 3. We now tally how many times each player is un-
derlined in Table 3. These are the critical counts: B1 = 5, 
B2 = 3, B3 = 3, and B4 = 1.
step 4. T = 5 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 12.
step 5. b1 = 5
12 = 412
3,; b2 = 3
12 = 25,; b3 = 3
12 = 25,, 
 
 
and b4 = 1
12 = 81
3,.
An interesting and unexpected result of these calculations is that the team’s 
general manager (P2) and the director of scouting operations (P3) have the same 
Banzhaf power index—not exactly the arrangement originally intended.

The Mathematics of Power
In a weighted voting system with 5 players and no dictators there are 26 possible  
coalitions (we will discuss this in more detail in Section 4). We can save a fair amount 
of effort by listing only the winning coalitions. A little organization will help: We will 
go through the winning coalitions systematically according to the number of players 
in the coalition. There is only one two-player winning coalition, namely 5P1, P26. 
The only three-player winning coalitions are those that include P1. All four-player 
coalitions are winning coalitions, and so is the grand coalition.
 
steps 1 and 2.  Table 4 shows all the winning coalitions, with the critical play-
ers underlined. (You should double check to make sure that these are the right 
critical players in each coalition—it’s good practice!)
 
step 3. The critical counts are B1 = 11, B2 = 5, B3 = 3, B4 = 3, and B5 = 3.
 
step 4. T = 25.
 
step 5. b1 = 11
25 = 44,; b2 = 5
25 = 20,; b3 = b4 = b5 = 3
25 = 12,.

The Tasmania State University Promotion and Tenure committee consists of 
five members: the dean (D) and four other faculty members of equal standing 
(F1, F2, F3, and F4). (For convenience we are using a slightly different notation for 
the players.) In this committee faculty members vote first, and motions are carried 
by simple majority. The dean votes only to break a 2–2 tie. Is this a weighted voting 
system? If so, what is the Banzhaf power distribution?
The answer to the first question is Yes, and the answer to the second question is 
that we can apply the same steps we used before even though we don’t have specific 
weights for the players.
 
step 1. The possible winning coalitions fall into two groups: (1) A majority 
(three or more) faculty members vote Yes. In this case the dean does not vote. 
These winning coalitions are listed in the first column of Table 5. (2) Only two 
faculty members vote yes, and the dean breaks the tie with a Yes vote. These 
winning coalitions are listed in the second column of Table 5.

The Mathematics of Power
step 2. In the winning coalitions consisting of just three faculty 
members, all faculty members are critical. In the coalition 
consisting of all four faculty members, no faculty member is 
critical. In the coalitions consisting of two faculty members 
plus the dean, all players, including the dean, are critical.  
Table 5 shows the critical players underlined in each winning 
coalition.
step 3. The dean is critical six times (in each of the six coali-
tions in the second column). Each of the faculty members is 
critical three times in the first column and three times in the 
second column. Thus, all players have a critical count of 6.
steps 4 and 5. Since all five players are critical an equal number 
of times, they share power equally (i.e., the Banzhaf power index 
of each player is 1
5 = 20%).
The surprising conclusion of Example 12 is that although the rules appear to 
set up a special role for the dean (the role of tiebreaker), in practice the dean is no 
different than any of the faculty members. A larger-scale version of Example 12 
occurs in the U.S. Senate, where the vice president of the United States can only 
vote to break a tie. An analysis similar to the one used in Example 12 shows that as 
a member of the Senate the vice president has the same Banzhaf power index as an 
ordinary senator.
Our next example is of interest for both historical and mathematical  
reasons.
The Vice President of 
the United States shall 
be the President of the 
Senate, but shall have 
no Vote, unless they 
be equally divided.

Throughout the 1900s county boards in the state of New York operated as weighted 
voting systems. The reasoning behind weighted voting was that counties are of-
ten divided into districts of uneven size and it seemed unfair to give an equal vote 
to both large and small districts. To eliminate this type of unfairness a system of 
proportional representation was used: Each district would have a number of votes 
roughly proportional to its population. Every 10 years, after the Census, the alloca-
tion of votes could change if the population changed, but the principle 
of proportional representation remained.
In this example we will focus on one specific case: the Nas-
sau County Board of Supervisors in the 1960s. At the time, Nas-
sau County was divided into six districts. Table 6 shows the names 
of the six districts and the number of votes each district had on 
the Board of Supervisors (based on population data from the 1960 
Census). The total number of votes was V = 115, and the quota 
was q = 58 (simple majority). Thus, from a mathematical point of 
view the Nassau County Board of Supervisors could be simply de-
scribed as 358: 31, 31, 28, 21, 2, 24. We use H1, H2, OB, NH, LB, 
and GC as shorthand for the six districts.
To simplify the computations that follow we find it convenient 
to divide the six players into the “Big 3” 1H1, H2, and OB2 and the 
“Lesser 3”(NH, LB, and GC). The winning coalitions will be orga-
nized into four groups:

In these coalitions, none of the players are critical.
 2.  Coalitions of the form 5H1, H2, *6. These are coalitions that include H1 and 
H2 and some subset of the “Lesser 3.” OB is not included in these coalitions. 
There are eight such coalitions. In these coalitions H1 and H2 are always critical; 
the remaining players are never critical.

OB and some subset of the “Lesser 3.” H2 is not included in these coalitions.

cal; the remaining players are never critical.

OB and some subset of the “Lesser 3.” H1 is not included in these coalitions. 
There are eight such coalitions. In these coalitions H2 and OB are always criti-
cal; the remaining players are never critical.
The list above covers all possible winning coalitions. It follows from all of 
the preceding observations (summarized in Table 7) that the critical count for 
each of the “Big 3” is 16, and the critical count for each of the “Lesser 3” is 0. 
The Banzhaf power index of each of the “Big 3,” therefore, is 1
3 = 33 1
3%, and the
Banzhaf power index of each of the “Lesser 3” is 0!
Example 13 reinforces the fact that in weighted voting you can have a lot of votes 
and yet have zero power. A player with votes but zero power is called a dummy. 
In the Nassau County Board of Supervisors Glen Cove, Long Beach, and North 
Hempstead were all dummies. The supervisors for these three districts attended 
meetings, participated in discussions, and voted in earnest not realizing that their 
votes were never relevant. The case of North Hempstead is especially serious—a 
district with a large population but no representation.
In a series of articles and law filings, John Banzhaf made the case that what 
was happening in Nassau County to North Hempstead, Long Beach, and Glen 
Cove (the three dummies) violated the “equal protection” clause guaranteed by 
the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Because of Banzhaf’s mathemat-
ical analysis and legal persistence, in 1993 a federal court made it unconstitutional 
for county boards to use proportional representation as the basis for weighted 
voting.

The Mathematics of Power
At present, the United Nations Security Council is made up of 15 member nations. 
Five of the member nations are permanent members: China (CH), France (FR), 
the Russian Federation (RU), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States 
(US). The remaining 10 member nations are nonpermanent members appointed 
for two-year terms on a rotating basis. We will use a generic symbol NP to describe 
any nonpermanent member. To pass a motion in the Security Council requires a 
Yes vote from each of the five permanent members plus at least four additional Yes 
votes from nonpermanent members. If any one of the permanent members votes 
No, the motion fails regardless of how many Yes votes it gets. In other words, each 
of the permanent members has veto power. It’s clear that the permanent members 
have more power than the nonpermanent members—but how much more?
Even though we don’t have the weights of the players, with the help of a little 
mathematics we will be able to compute the Banzhaf power distribution. This is a 
very large weighted voting system, with 15 players and hundreds of winning coali-
tions, so we don’t want to list the winning coalitions.
n step 1. For our purposes, the winning coalitions can be divided into two types: 
(1)Coalitions with the 5 permanent members plus 4 nonpermanent members 
(first row of Table 8). These are coalitions that just make the cut, and every 
member of such a coalition is critical. There are 210 coalitions in this group. 
(2) Coalitions with the 5 permanent members plus 5 or more nonpermanent 
members (second row of Table 8). In these coalitions none of the nonperma-
nent members is critical (there is slack now for the requirement of a minimum 
of 4 nonpermanent members). The permanent members continue to be critical. 
There are 638 coalitions in this group.

n BPI of each of the 5 permanent members: 848
5080 _ 16.7% 
n BPI of each of the 10 nonpermanent members: 84
5080 _ 1.65% 
We now have enough information to find the Banzhaf power distribution in 
the Security Council, but we will have to do so in a slightly roundabout way (Step 4 
before Steps 2 and 3).
n step 4.  We will first find the total critical count T. Each of the 210 coalitions of type 
(1) has 9 critical players. This contributes 210 * 9 = 1890 to T. Each of the 
638 coalitions of type (2) has 5 critical players. This contributes another 
638 * 5 = 3190 to T. Adding the two gives T = 1890 + 3190 = 5080.
n steps 2 and 3. Each permanent member is critical in each of the 848 winning co-
alitions. This gives each permanent member a critical count of 848 and accounts 
for 848 * 5 = 4240 of the total. The remaining 840 15080 - 42402 are divided

The Mathematics of Power
equally among the 10 nonpermanent members, so each nonpermanent member 
has a critical count of 84.
n step 5. The Banzhaf power index of each permanent member is 848
5080 = 16.7%; the 
 
Banzhaf power index of each nonpermanent member is 84
5080 = 1.65%.
In this section we will discuss a different approach to measuring power, first pro-
posed by the American mathematician Lloyd Shapley and the economist Martin 
Shubik in 1954. The key difference between the Shapley-Shubik measure of power 
and the Banzhaf measure of power centers on the concept of a sequential coalition. 
In the Shapley-Shubik method the assumption is that coalitions are formed sequen-
tially: Players join the coalition and cast their votes in an orderly sequence (there is 
a first player, then comes a second player, then a third, etc.).
We will illustrate the main idea with a simple example.
Shapley-Shubik Power

We discussed this weighted voting system in Section 2. We will now look at things 
from a slightly different point of view. Suppose that players join coalitions one at a 
time and that we want to consider the order in which the players join the coalition. 
With three players there are six possibilities. (Just for now we will list them in some 
random order. Later we will try to organize ourselves a little better.)
1.  P2 goes first, P1 goes second, P3 goes last. We describe this using the notation 
8P2, P1, P39. (The 8 9 is a convenient way to indicate that the players are listed 
in order from left to right.) This coalition starts with 2 votes, picks up 3 more 
when P1 joins (now it has 5 votes), and picks up 1 more vote when P3 joins. 
The key observation is that the player who had the pivotal role in making the 
coalition a winning coalition was P1. We will call P1 the pivotal player of that 
coalition.
2.  P3 goes first, P2 goes second, P1 goes last. We write this as 8P3, P2, P19. This 
coalition starts with 1 vote, picks up 2 more when P2 joins (now it has 3 votes), 
and picks up 3 more when P1 joins. Once again, it’s not until P1 joins the coali-
tion that there are enough votes to meet the quota. Score another one for P1!
3.  8P1, P2, P39. This coalition starts with 3 votes and gets 2 more votes when P2 
joins. No need to go any further. The pivotal player in this coalition is P2.
4.  8P1, P3, P29. This coalition starts with 3 votes and gets 1 more vote when P3 
joins. That’s 4 votes, enough to win. The pivotal player in this coalition is P3.
5.  8P2, P3, P19. This coalition starts with 2 votes and gets 1 more vote when P3 
joins. That’s 3 votes, not enough to win. It takes P1 joining at the end to turn 
the coalition into a winning coalition. The pivotal player in this coalition is P1.
6.  8P3, P1, P29. This coalition starts with 1 vote and gets 3 more votes when P1 
joins. That’s 4 votes, enough to win. The pivotal player in this coalition is P1.

Example 14 has an interesting aftermath. The power of the veto gives the per-
manent members roughly 10 times as much power as that of the nonpermanent 
members, and this was not the way that the Security Council was originally intended 
to work. It took Banzhaf’s interpretation of power together with some nice math-
ematics to figure this out. To make the power distribution more balanced, there 
are plans in the works to change the current 15-nation arrangement by adding ad-
ditional permanent members and changing the voting rules.
53

The Mathematics of Power
The six scenarios above cover all possibilities. Going down the list, we can see 
that in these six scenarios P1 was the pivotal player four times, whereas P2 and P3 
were pivotal once each. One could reasonably argue that P1 has four times as much 
power as either P2 or P3.
We will now formally define some of the ideas introduced in Example 15 and 
end with a definition of Shapley-Shubik power. We will also introduce an important 
mathematical concept—the factorial of a number. We will discuss factorials in great-
er detail in Section 4, but for now we just need to know what the term factorial means.
n sequential coalition. A sequential coalition is an ordered list of the players. We 
write sequential coalitions in the form 8P1, P2, c, PN9. The order of the play-
ers is from left to right. A good way to think of a sequential coalition is as a line 
of people with the head of the line on the left.
n Factorial of n. For any positive integer N, the product of all the integers be-
tween 1 and N is called the factorial of N and written N!. In other words,
N! = 1 * 2 * 3 * g* N.
 
The exclamation mark after the number indicates a factorial. The reason fac-
torials are relevant to our discussion here is the following: A weighted voting 
system with N players has N! sequential coalitions.
n pivotal player. When looking at a sequential coalition start counting votes from 
left to right. At some point (maybe not until the end) there are enough votes to 
win. The first player that makes this possible is the pivotal player in that coali-
tion. Every sequential coalition has one and only one pivotal player.
n pivotal count. For each player we count how many times the player is a pivotal 
player as we run over all possible sequential coalitions. This gives the pivotal 
count for that player. We use the notation SS1, SS2, c, SSN to denote the piv-
otal counts of P1, P2, c, PN respectively.
n The shapley-shubik power index (sspi). The Shapley-Shubik power index of 
a player is the ratio of the player’s pivotal count over the total pivotal count 
for all the players. Since with N players there are N! sequential coalitions and 
since there is exactly one pivotal player in each, the total pivotal count for all 
players is N!. Thus, we can rephrase the definition as: The Shapley-Shubik 
power index of a player is the ratio of the player’s pivotal count over N!. We 
will use the Greek letter s (sigma) to represent the Shapley-Shubik power, so 
that s1, s2, c, sN denote the Shapley-Shubik power indexes of P1, P2, c, PN 
respectively.
n The shapley-shubik power distribution. The list s1, s2, c, sN of all the 
Shapley-Shubik power indexes gives the Shapley-Shubik power distribution of 
the weighted voting system. It essentially describes the division of the “power 
pie” among the players based on their Shapley-Shubik power indexes.
The following is a summary of the steps needed to compute the Shapley-Shubik 
power distribution of a weighted voting system with N players.
  
n step 1. Make a list of the N! sequential coalitions with the N players.
n step 2. In each sequential coalition determine the pivotal player. (For book-
keeping purposes underline the pivotal players.)
n step 3. Find the pivotal counts SS1, SS2, c, SSN.
n step 4. Compute the SSPIs s1 =

step 3. The pivotal counts are SS1 = 10, SS2 = 6, SS3 = 6, and SS4 = 2.

If you compare this result with the Banzhaf power distribution obtained in  
Example 10, you will notice that here the two power distributions are the same.  
If nothing else, this shows that it is not impossible for the Banzhaf and Shapley-
Shubik power distributions to agree. In general, however, for randomly chosen real-
life situations it is very unlikely that the Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik methods will 
give the same answer.
In Example 10 (The NBA Draft) we computed the Banzhaf power distribution of 
the weighted voting system 36: 4, 3, 2, 14. Now we will find the Shapley-Shubik 
power distribution.
 
steps 1 and 2. Table 9 shows the 24 sequential coalitions with P1, P2, P3, and 
P4. In each sequential coalition the pivotal player is underlined. (Note that the 
24 sequential coalitions in Table 9 are not randomly listed—each column cor-
responds to the sequential coalitions with a given first player. You may want to 
use the same or a similar pattern when you do the exercises on Shapley-Shubik 
power distributions.)

In some cities the city council operates under what is known as the “strong-mayor” 
system. Under this system the city council can pass a motion under simple majority, 
but the mayor has the power to veto the decision. The mayor’s veto can then be over-
ruled by a “supermajority” of the council members. As an illustration of the strong-
mayor system we will consider the city council of Cleansburg. In Cleansburg the city 
council has four members plus a strong mayor who has a vote as well as the power to 
veto motions supported by a simple majority of the council members. On the other 
hand, the mayor cannot veto motions supported by all four council members. Thus, a 
motion can pass if the mayor plus two or more council members support it or, alterna-
tively, if the mayor is against it but the four council members support it.
Common sense tells us that under these rules, the four council members have 
the same amount of power but the mayor has more. We will compute the Shapley-
Shubik power distribution of this weighted voting system to figure out exactly how 
much more. For convenience, we will let P1 denote the mayor and P2, P3, P4, P5 
denote the four council members.
With five players, this weighted voting system has 5! = 120 sequential coalitions 
to consider. Obviously, we would prefer not to have to write them all down. De-
pending on where the mayor sits on the sequential coalition, we have 5 different 
scenarios, each consisting of 24 sequential coalitions (Table 10).

Pivotal counts: SS1 = 48; SS2 = SS3 = SS4 = SS5 = 18
Shapley-Shubik power: s1 = 48
120 = 40%; s2 = s3 = s4 = s5 = 18
120 = 15%
Notice that the mayor is the pivotal player when he is in the third or fourth 
position (rows 3 and 4 in Table 10). This gives the mayor a pivotal count of 48.  
The remaining 72 sequential coalitions have city council members as pivotal players 
(in equal numbers). This gives each city council member a pivotal count of 72
4 = 18.
It follows that the Shapley-Shubik power index of the mayor is s1 =
48
120 = 40%
and each of the four council members has a Shapley-Shubik power index of 15%. In 
conclusion, the Shapley-Shubik power distribution of the Cleansburg City Council 
is s1 = 40,, s2 = s3 = s4 = s5 = 15,.
For the purposes of comparison, the reader is encouraged to calculate the  
Banzhaf power distribution of the Cleansburg City Council (see Exercise 76).
In Example 14, we computed the Banzhaf power distribution in the United Nations 
Security Council. In this example we will outline how one might be able to find the 
Shapley-Shubik power distribution. We will skip a few of the mathematical details 
as they go beyond the scope of this text.
Recall that the U.N. Security Council has 5 permanent members and 10 non-
permanent members. A motion carries if all 5 permanent members and at least 4 
nonpermanent members vote for it. The following is an outline of the computations:
n step 1. There are 15! (about 1.3 trillion) sequential coalitions of 15 players.
n steps 2 and 3. A nonpermanent member can be pivotal only if it is the 9th 
player in the coalition, preceded by all five of the permanent members and three 
nonpermanent members (Fig. 1). There are approximately 2.44 billion sequen-
tial coalitions of this type.

a Shapley-Shubik power index of 0.19%) have together 1.9% of the power 
pie, leaving the remaining 98.2% to be divided equally among the 5 perma-
nent members. Thus, the Shapley-Shubik power index of each permanent 
member is approximately 19.64%.
This analysis shows the enormous difference between the Shapley-Shubik 
power of the permanent and nonpermanent members of the Security Council—
permanent members have roughly 100 times the Shapley-Shubik power of nonper-
manent members!
The president of the United States is allegedly the most powerful person in the 
world. To get elected president, a candidate must get a majority (270 or more) of 
the 538 electoral votes in the Electoral College. Electoral votes are assigned to the 
50 states and the District of Columbia based on their representation in Congress 
(i.e., number of electoral votes = number of representatives + 2; the District of 
Columbia gets 3 votes by law). The first column of Table 11 shows the number of 
electoral votes for each state based on the 2010 Census. These numbers apply to the 
2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections (they will probably change after the 2020 
Census).
Each state casts all its elec-
toral votes to the winner of the 
popular vote in that state (there 
are two small exceptions to this 
“winner-take-all” rule—Maine 
and Nebraska allow their elec-
toral votes to be split), and 
voting typically boils down to 
two options—the Republican 
candidate or the Democratic 
candidate (the last time a third-
party candidate received any 
electoral votes was 1968). If we 
assume that there are only two 
choices (Republican or Demo-
crat) and make a slight conces-
sion to expediency and assume 
that Maine and Nebraska do 
not split their votes, then the 
Electoral College becomes a very large and complicated weighted voting system (538 
total votes, quota q = 270, and 51 players with weights as shown in the first column of 
Table 11).
The power distribution in the Electoral College is one of the many impor-
tant variables to consider in a presidential campaign (for example in determin-
ing the best way to allocate campaign resources and effort among the states). 
Table 11 shows both the Shapley-Shubik and Banzhaf power index of each 
state in the current Electoral College. It is quite remarkable that the numbers 
all the way down the list are almost identical. This tells us that the power dis-
tribution in the Electoral College is “robust,” as both methods tell essentially 
the same story.
Because the Electoral College is such a large weighted voting system, the cal-
culations of the power indexes in Table 11 can only be done using advanced math-
ematical techniques that go beyond the scope of this text and require some sophis-
ticated software.

The goal of this section is to provide a quick primer of basic facts about two very 
important mathematical concepts: subsets and permutations. These basic facts turn 
out to be quite useful when working with coalitions and sequential coalitions.
subsets and Coalitions
Coalitions are essentially sets of players that join forces to vote on a motion. (This is 
the reason we used set notation in Section 2 to work with coalitions.) By definition,

The Mathematics of Power
a subset of a set is any combination of elements from the set. This includes the set 
with nothing in it (called the empty set and denoted by 5 6) as well as the set with 
all the elements (the original set itself).
Table 12 shows the eight subsets of the set 5P1, P2, P36 and the 16 subsets of the set 
5P1, P2, P3, P46. The subsets of 5P1, P2, P3, P46 are organized into two groups—
the “no P4” group and the “add P4” group. The subsets in the “no P4” group are 
exactly the 8 subsets of 5P1, P2, P36; the subsets of the “add P4” group are obtained 
by adding P4 to each of the 8 subsets of 5P1, P2, P36. Thus, adding one more ele-
ment to the set 5P1, P2, P36 doubled the number of subsets. Note that the number 
of subsets of a set is completely independent of the names of its elements, so any set 
with 3 elements, regardless of what they are called, has 8 subsets, and any set with 
four elements has 16 subsets.

The key observation in Example 20 is that by adding one more element to 
a set we double the number of subsets, and this principle applies to sets of any 
size. Since a set with 4 elements has 16 subsets, a set with 5 elements must have 32 
subsets and a set with 6 elements must have 64 subsets. This leads to the following 
key fact:
n Number of subsets. A set with N elements has 2N subsets.
Now that we can count subsets, we can also count coalitions. The only differ-
ence between coalitions and subsets is that we don’t consider the empty set a coali-
tion (the purpose of a coalition is to cast votes, so you need at least one player to 
have a coalition).
n Number of coalitions. A weighted voting system with N players has 2N - 1
coalitions.
Finally, when computing critical counts and Banzhaf power, we are interested 
in listing just the winning coalitions. If we assume that there are no dictators, then 
winning coalitions have to have at least two players and we can, therefore, rule out 
all the single-player coalitions from our list. There are N different single-player co-
alitions, which leads to our next fact:
n Number of coalitions of two or more players. A weighted voting system with N 
players has 2N - N - 1 coalitions of two or more players.

The Mathematics of Power
permutations and sequential Coalitions
n permutation. A permutation of a set of objects is an ordered list of the objects. 
When you change the order of the objects you get a different permutation of 
those objects.
When the objects are people, a permutation is analogous to having the people 
form a line: first person, second person, etc. Rearrange the folks in the line and you 
get a different permutation.
The six permutations of P1, P2, P3 are shown at the top of Fig. 2. Now imagine that 
P4 shows up and we have to add her to the line. We can position P4 at the back of 
the line, or in third place, or second place, or at the front of the line (Fig. 2). For 
each of the six permutations of P1, P2, P3 we get four permutations of P1, P2, P3, P4 
depending on where we choose to put P4. Thus, we have a total of 24 permutations 
of the 4 objects.

The connection between sequential coalitions and permutations is pretty 
straightforward: A sequential coalition of N players is just a permutation of the 
players. This leads to the following:
n Number of sequential coalitions. A weighted voting system with N players has 
N! sequential coalitions.
n Number of permutations. There are N! = N * (N - 1) * c * 3 * 2 * 1 differ-
ent permutations of N objects.
Note that 6 = 3 * 2 * 1 = 3! and 24 = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 4!. Generalizing the idea 
in Example 21 gives the following important fact:
In Example 21 we generated the 24 permutations of P1, P2, P3, P4 by putting P4 in 
each of 4 possible slots in a permutation of P1, P2, P3. This means that there are 6 
coalitions with P4 in last place, 6 more with P4 in third place, 6 with P4 in second 
place, and 6 with P4 at the head of the line (read Fig. 2 horizontally). What is true 
for P4 is true for each of the other players: There are 6 permutations with P3 in last 
place, 6 more with P3 in third place, 6 with P3 in second place, and 6 with P3 at the 
head of the line. Same for P2 and P1.

The Mathematics of Power
The observations made in Example 22 can be generalized to any player in any 
position in any weighted voting system.
n Number of sequential coalitions with P in the kth position. Let P be a player 
in a weighted voting system with N players and k an arbitrary position be-
tween first and last. There are (N - 1)! sequential coalitions with P in the 
kth position.
We discussed weighted voting—voting situations in which the voters (called play-
ers) control different numbers of votes. The idea behind weighted voting is that 
sometimes we want to give some players more power than others over the outcome 
of the voting. Weighted voting is used in partnerships where some partners own a 
larger share than others; in international bodies where some countries are more in-
fluential than others; in county boards where some districts are bigger than others; 
in the Electoral College where the big states have more votes than the small states; 
and even at home, where Mom has more votes than anyone else when deciding 
where the family goes on vacation.
The big fallacy in weighted voting is the idea that the power of the play-
ers is proportional to the number of votes they control. We saw examples of 
players with a few votes but plenty of power as well as players with many votes 
and no power. If power were proportional to votes, computing the power of the  
players in a weighted voting system would be not only easy but also very uninter-
esting. Because power is not proportional to votes, computing power is harder but 
much more interesting.
We looked at the two most commonly used ways to compute the distribution of 
power among the players in a weighted voting system: the Banzhaf power distribu-
tion and the Shapley-Shubik power distribution. These two approaches provide two 
different ways to measure power, and, while they occasionally agree (Example 19 
The Electoral College), they can also differ significantly (Examples 14 and 18 The 
U.N. Security Council). Of the two, which one is better?
Unfortunately, there is no simple answer. Both are useful, and in some sense 
the choice is subjective. Perhaps the best way to evaluate them is to think of them 
as being based on a slightly different set of assumptions. The idea behind Banzhaf 
power is that players are free to come and go, negotiating their allegiance for power 
(somewhat like professional athletes since the advent of free agency). Underlying 
Shapley-Shubik power is the assumption that when a player joins a coalition the 
player is making a commitment to stay. In the latter case a player’s power is gener-
ated by its ability to be in the right place at the right time.
In practice the choice of which method to use for measuring power is based on 
which of the assumptions better fits the specifics of the situation. Contrary to what 
we’ve often come to expect, mathematics does not give us the answer, just the tools 
that might help us make an informed decision.

 55. A partnership has four partners (P1, P2, P3, and P4). In 
this partnership P1 has twice as many votes as P2; P2 has

 56. In a weighted voting system with four players the winning

 58. The Smith family has two parents 1P1 and P22 and three

the Banzhaf power index for your calculations.
 
(c) If you have the money and the cost per share is fixed, 
should you buy one share or two shares (from a sin-
gle person)? Explain.
 72. Mergers. Sometimes in a weighted voting system two or 
more players decide to merge—that is to say, to combine their 
votes and always vote the same way. (Note that a merger is 
different from a coalition—coalitions are temporary, whereas 
mergers are permanent.) For example, if in the weighted vot-
ing system 37: 5, 3, 14 P2 and P3 were to merge, the weighted 
voting system would then become 37: 5, 44. In this exercise 
we explore the effects of mergers on a player’s power.
 
(a) Consider the weighted voting system 34: 3, 2, 14. 
In Example 9 we saw that P2 and P3 each have a 
Banzhaf power index of 1>5. Suppose that P2 and P3 
merge and become a single player P*. What is the 
Banzhaf power index of P*?
 
(b) Consider the weighted voting system 35: 3, 2, 14. 
Find first the Banzhaf power indexes of players P2 
and P3 and then the Banzhaf power index of P* (the 
merger of P2 and P3). Compare.
 
(c) Rework the problem in (b) for the weighted voting 
system 36: 3, 2, 14.
 
(d) What are your conclusions from (a), (b), and (c)?
 73. Decisive voting systems. A weighted voting system is 
called decisive if for every losing coalition, the coalition 
consisting of the remaining players (called the comple-
ment) must be a winning coalition.
 
(a) Show that the weighted voting system 35: 4, 3, 24 is 
decisive.
 
(b) Show that the weighted voting system 33: 2, 1, 1, 14 
is decisive.
 
(c) Explain why any weighted voting system with a dic-
tator is decisive.
 
(d) Find the number of winning coalitions in a decisive 
voting system with N players.
 74. Equivalent voting systems. Two weighted voting systems 
are equivalent if they have the same number of players 
and exactly the same winning coalitions.
 
(a) Show that the weighted voting systems 38: 5, 3, 24 
and 32: 1, 1, 04 are equivalent.
 
(b) Show that the weighted voting systems 37: 4, 3, 2, 14 
and 35: 3, 2, 1, 14 are equivalent.
 
(c) Show that the weighted voting system discussed in 
Example 12 is equivalent to 33: 1, 1, 1, 1, 14.
 
(d) Explain why equivalent weighted voting systems 
must have the same Banzhaf power distribution.
 
(e) Explain why equivalent weighted voting systems must 
have the same Shapley-Shubik power distribution.
 75. Relative voting power. The relative voting weight wi of a 
player Pi is the fraction of votes controlled by that player. 
 66. (a)  Verify that the weighted voting systems 312: 7, 4, 
3, 24 and 324: 14, 8, 6, 44 result in exactly the same 
Shapley-Shubik power distribution. (If you need to 
make calculations, do them for both systems side by 
side and look for patterns.)
 
(b) Based on your work in (a), explain why the two propor-
tional weighted voting systems 3q: w1, w2, c, wN4 
and 3cq: cw1, cw2, c, cwN4 always have the same 
Shapley-Shubik power distribution.
 67. A law firm has N + 1 partners: the senior partner with 
N votes, and N junior partners with one vote each. The 
quota is a simple majority of the votes. Find the Shapley-
Shubik power distribution in this weighted voting system. 
(Hint: Try Exercise 53 or 54 first.)
 68. Consider the generic weighted voting system 3q: w1, w2,
c, wN4. (Assume w1 Ú w2 Ú gÚ wN.)
 
(a) Find all the possible values of q for which no player 
has veto power.
 
(b) Find all the possible values of q for which every player 
has veto power.
 
(c) Find all the possible values of q for which Pi has veto 
power but Pi + 1 does not. (Hint: See Exercise 60.)
 69. The weighted voting system 38: 6, 4, 2, 14 represents a 
partnership among four partners (P1, P2, P3, and you!). 
You are the partner with just one vote, and in this situ-
ation you have no power (you dummy!). Not wanting to 
remain a dummy, you offer to buy one vote. Each of the 
other four partners is willing to sell you one of their votes, 
and they are all asking the same price. From which part-
ner should you buy in order to get as much power for 
your buck as possible? Use the Banzhaf power index for 
your calculations. Explain your answer.
 70. The weighted voting system 327: 10, 8, 6, 4, 24 represents 
a partnership among five people (P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5). 
You are P5, the one with two votes. You want to increase 
your power in the partnership and are prepared to buy 
one share (one share equals one vote) from any of the 
other partners. Partners P1, P2, and P3 are each willing to 
sell cheap ($1000 for one share), but P4 is not being quite 
as cooperative—she wants $5000 for one of her shares. 
Given that you still want to buy one share, from whom 
should you buy it? Use the Banzhaf power index for your 
calculations. Explain your answer.
 71. The weighted voting system 318: 10, 8, 6, 4, 24 represents a 
partnership among five people 1P1, P2, P3, P4, and P52. You 
are P5, the one with two votes. You want to increase your 
power in the partnership and are prepared to buy shares (one 
share equals one vote) from any of the other partners.
 
(a) Suppose that each partner is willing to sell one share 
and that they are all asking the same price. Assuming 
that you decide to buy only one share, from which 
partner should you buy? Use the Banzhaf power in-
dex for your calculations.
 
(b) Suppose that each partner is willing to sell two shares 
and that they are all asking the same price. Assum-
ing that you decide to buy two shares from a single

 (i) 
 increase his Banzhaf power index by becoming 
an antagonist of another player.
 
 
 (ii)  decrease his Banzhaf power index by becoming 
an antagonist of another player.

index of P1 is 3
4.

players a player cannot have a Shapley-Shubik power 
index of more than 3
4 unless he or she is a dictator.
 
(c) Show that in any weighted voting system with N play-
ers a player cannot have a Shapley-Shubik power

N players a player with veto power must have a

A player’s Banzhaf power index bi can differ consider-

other council members). A motion can be passed by the 
mayor and at least three other council members, or by at 
least five of the six ordinary council members.
 
(a) Describe the Fresno City Council as a weighted vot-

Fresno City Council. (Hint: See Example 17 for some

 78. Suppose that in a weighted voting system there is a player 
A who hates another player P so much that he will always 
vote the opposite way of P, regardless of the issue. We 
will call A the antagonist of P.
 
(a) Suppose that in the weighted voting system 38: 5, 4, 
3, 24, P is the player with two votes and his antag-
onist A is the player with five votes. The other two 
players we’ll call P2 and P3. What are the possible 
coalitions under these circumstances? What is the 
Banzhaf power distribution under these circumstances?
 1 The Johnston power index
The Banzhaf and Shapley-Shubik power indexes are not the 
only two mathematical methods for measuring power. The 
Johnston power index is a subtle but rarely used variation of 
the Banzhaf power index in which the power of a player is 
based not only on how often he or she is critical in a coali-
tion, but also on the number of other players in the coalition. 
Specifically, being a critical player in a coalition of 2 players 
contributes 1
2 toward your power score; being critical in a coali-
tion of 3 players contributes 1
3 toward your power score; and 
being critical in a coalition of 10 contributes only 1
10 toward 
your power score.
A player’s Johnston power score is obtained by adding 
all such fractions over all coalitions in which the player is 
critical. The player’s Johnston power index is his or her John-
ston power score divided by the sum of all players’ power 
scores.
Prepare a presentation on the Johnston power index. In-
clude a mathematical description of the procedure for comput-
ing Johnston power, give examples, and compare the results with 
the ones obtained using the Banzhaf method. Include your own 
personal analysis of the merits of the Johnston method com-
pared with the Banzhaf method.

 4 banzhaf power and the law
John Banzhaf was a lawyer, and he made his original argu-
ments on behalf of his mathematical method to measure power  
in court cases, most of which involved the Nassau County 
Board of Supervisors in New York State. (See the discussion 
in Example 13.) Among the more significant court cases were 
Graham v. Board of Supervisors (1966); Bechtle v. Board of 
Supervisors (1981); League of Women Voters v. Board of Su-
pervisors (1983); and Jackson v. Board of Supervisors (1991). 
Other important legal cases based on the Banzhaf method 
for measuring power but not involving Nassau County were 
Ianucci v. Board of Supervisors of Washington County and 
Morris v. Board of Estimate (U.S. Supreme Court, 1989). 
Choose one or two of these cases, read their background, ar-
guments, and the court’s decision, and write a brief for each. 
This is a good project for pre-law and political science majors, 
but it might require access to a good law library.
for the Electoral College? What are the prospects that it will 
be reformed or eliminated?
 3  mathematical arguments in Favor of the 
Electoral College
As a method for electing the president, the Electoral College 
is widely criticized as being undemocratic. At the same time, 
different arguments have been made over the years to support 
the case that the Electoral College is not nearly as bad as it 
seems. Physicist Alan Natapoff has used mathematical ideas 
(many of which are connected to the material in this chapter) 
to argue that the Electoral College is a better system than 
a direct presidential election. A summary of Natapoff’s 
arguments are given in the article “Math Against Tyr-
anny,” by Will Hively (Discover, Nov. 1996, 74–85). Write 
a paper explaining Natapoff’s mathematical arguments in 
support of the Electoral College.

the weights of all the players in the coalition except Pk is less 
than q. Consequently, if the weights of all the players in that 
coalition are multiplied by c > 0 (c = 0 would make no sense), 
then the sum of the weights of all the players in the coalition 
(including Pk) is at least cq but the sum of the weights of all the 
players in the coalition except Pk is less than cq. Therefore, Pk 
is critical in the same coalitions in the weighted voting system

Fair-Division Games
As children, the Elghanayan brothers probably did not give a lot 
of thought to how to best divide their Halloween stash of candy. 
Fifty years later, when Henry, Fred, and Tom Elghanayan decided 
to break up their forty - year partnership and split up the assets, they 
did indeed give a great deal of thought to the question of division. 
After all, they were about to divide $3 billion worth of New York 
City real estate holdings.

he fact that the Elghanayan brothers were able to split up so much valuable 
property (8000 apartments, 9 office buildings, and 9 development projects) 
without lawsuits or bad blood is a testament to the power of a surprising 
idea: When different parties—with different preferences and values—have to divide 
commonly owned assets, it is actually possible to carry out the division in a way that is so 
fair that each party comes out of the deal feeling that they got more than they deserved.
The problem of dividing a real estate empire worth $3 billion and the problem 
of dividing a stash of Halloween candy are not all that different. Other than the 
stakes involved they share the same basic elements: a set of assets, a group of indi-
viduals that have some equity in the assets, and a shared goal of dividing the assets 
in a fair way. These types of problems are part of an interesting and important class 
of problems known as fair-division problems.
Fairness is an innate human value, based on empathy, the instinct for coopera-
tion, and, to some extent, self-interest. A theory for sharing things fairly based on 
cooperation, reason, and logic is one of the great achievements of social science, and, 
once again, we can trace the roots of this achievement to a branch of mathematics 
known as game theory. In this chapter we will give a basic introduction to the subject.
We will start (Section 1) with some general background: What are the ele-
ments of a fair-division game and what are the requirements for a fair-division 
method? In the remaining five sections we introduce five 
different fair-division methods. In Section 2 we 
discuss the divider-chooser method, a fair-division 
method that applies when dividing a continuous 
(i.e., infinitely divisible) asset between two players. 
In Sections 3 and 4 we discuss two different 
extensions of the divider-chooser method 
that can be used to divide a continuous 
asset among three or more players: the  
lone-divider method and the lone-
chooser method. In Sections 5 and 6 
we discuss two different fair-division 
methods that can be used when 
 dividing a set of discrete (i.e., indi-
visible) assets: the method of sealed 
bids and the method of markers.
 T
I’m happy with the 
assets I ended up with, 
and my guess is that 
they [the brothers] are 
happy also. Assets 
have different values to 
different people. There 
is no such thing as a 
fair market value; it’s a 
fair market value in the 
mind of each person.

The Mathematics of Sharing
In this section we will introduce some of the basic concepts and terminology of fair 
division. We will think of fair-division problems in terms of games—with players, 
goals, rules, and strategies.
Basic Elements of a Fair-Division Game
The underlying elements of every fair-division game are as follows:
n The assets. This is the formal name we will give to the “goodies” being divided.
Typically, the assets are tangible physical objects such as real estate, jewelry, 
art, candy, cake, and so on. In some situations the assets being divided may 
be intangible things such as rights—water rights, drilling rights, broadcast 
licenses, and so on. (While the term “assets” has a connotation of positive value,  
sometimes what is being divided has negative value—chores, obligations, li-
abilities, etc. In this chapter we will focus on the division of positive assets, but 
in Example 12 we discuss a situation in which negative-valued assets have to 
be divided.) Regardless of the nature of the assets, we will use the symbol S 
throughout this chapter to denote the set of all assets being divided.
n The players. In every fair-division game there is a set of parties with the right (or 
in some cases the duty) to divide among themselves a set of jointly owned assets. 
They are the players in the game. Most of the time the players in a fair-division 
game are individuals, but it is worth noting that some of the most significant ap-
plications of fair division occur when the players are institutions (ethnic groups, 
political parties, states, and even nations).
n The value systems. The fundamental assumption we will make is that each 
player has the ability to give a value to any part of the assets. Specifically, this 
means that each player can look at the set S or any subset of S and assign to it a 
value—either in absolute terms (“to me, that plot of land is worth $875,000”) or 
in relative terms (“to me, that plot of land is worth 30% of the total value of all 
assets”).
n A fair-division method. These are the rules that govern the way the game is played. 
Fair-division methods are very specific and leave no room for ambiguity. We will 
discuss in much greater detail various fair-division methods in the remaining sec-
tions of the chapter.
Like most games, fair-division games are predicated on certain assumptions about 
the players. For the purposes of our discussion, we will make the following four 
assumptions:
n Rationality. Each of the players is a thinking, rational entity seeking to maximize 
his or her share of the assets. We will further assume that in the pursuit of this 
goal, a player’s moves are based on reason alone (we are taking emotion, psy-
chology, mind games, and all other nonrational elements out of the picture).
n Cooperation. The players are willing participants and accept the rules of the 
game as binding. The rules are such that after a finite number of moves by the 
players, the game terminates with a division of the assets. (There are no outsid-
ers such as judges or referees involved in these games—just the players and the 
rules.)
n Privacy. Players have no useful information on the other players’ value systems 
and thus of what kinds of moves they are going to make in the game. (This 
assumption does not always hold in real life, especially if the players are siblings 
or friends.)

The Mathematics of Sharing
n Symmetry. Players have equal rights in sharing the assets. A consequence of this 
assumption is that, at a minimum, each player is entitled to a proportional share 
of the assets—when there are two players, each is entitled to at least one-half of 
the assets, with three players each is entitled to at least one-third of the assets, 
and so on. (Fair-division methods can also be used in situations in which differ-
ent players are entitled by right to different-sized shares of the assets. For more 
details on asymmetric fair division, see Exercise 70 and Project 2.)
Fair Shares and Fair Divisions
Given a set of players P1, P2, c, PN and a set of assets S, the ultimate purpose of 
a fair-division game is to produce a fair division of S. But what does this mean? To 
formalize the precise meaning of this seemingly subjective idea, we introduce two 
very important definitions.
n Fair share (to a player P ). Suppose that s denotes a share of the set of assets S 
and that P is one of the players in a fair-division game with N players. The share 
s is called a proportional fair share (or just simply a fair share) to P, if, in P’s 
opinion, the value of s is at least 1
Nth of the value of S.
n Fair division (of the set of assets S ). Suppose we are able to divide the set of as-
sets S into N shares (call them s1, s2, c, sN) and assign each of these shares to 
one of the players. If each player considers the share he or she received to be a 
fair share (i.e., worth at least 1
Nth of the value of S), then we have achieved a fair 
division of the set of assets S.
Three brothers—say Henry, Tom, and Fred—are splitting up their partnership and 
dividing a bunch of assets of unspecified value. The set of assets S is divided (at this 
point we don’t care how) into three shares: s1, s2, and s3. In Henry’s opinion, the 
values of the three shares (expressed as a percentage of the value of S) are, respec-
tively, 32%, 31% and 37%. This information is displayed in the first row of Table 1.  
Likewise, the second and third rows of Table 1 show the values that each of the 
other two brothers assigns to each of the three shares.
n  Fair shares. To Henry, s3 is the only fair share (the other two shares 
fall below the fair-share threshold of 33 1
3%); to Tom, s1 and s3 are both 
fair shares; to Fred, who values all three shares equally, they are all fair 
shares.
n  Fair divisions. To assign each player a fair share we start with Henry 
because with him we have only one option—we have to assign him s3. 
With Tom we seem to have, at least in principle, two options—s1 and s3 
are both fair shares—but s3 is gone, so our only choice is to assign him 
s1. This leaves the final share s2 for Fred. Since all three players received 
a fair share, we have achieved a fair division. (Notice that this does 
not mean that all players are equally happy—Tom would have been 
happier with s3 rather than s1, but such is life. All that a fair division 
promises the players is that they will get a fair share, not the best share.)

Fair-Division methods
A fair-division method is a set of rules that, when properly used by the players, guar-
antees that at the end of the game each player will have received a fair share of the 
assets. The key requirement is the guarantee—no matter what the circumstances, 
the method should produce a fair division of the assets. The next example illustrates 
a seemingly reasonable method that fails this test.

The Mathematics of Sharing
There are many different fair-division methods known, but in this chapter we 
will discuss only a few of the classic ones. Depending on the nature of the set S, a 
fair-division game can be classified as one of three types: continuous, discrete, or 
mixed, and the fair-division methods used depend on which of these types we are 
facing.
n Continuous fair division. Here the set S is divisible in infinitely many ways, and 
shares can be increased or decreased by arbitrarily small amounts. Typical ex-
amples of continuous fair-division games involve the division of land, a cake, a 
pizza, and so forth.
n Discrete fair division. Here the set S is made up of objects that are indivisible, 
like paintings, houses, cars, boats, jewelry, and so on. (What about pieces of 
candy? One might argue that with a sharp enough knife a piece of candy could 
be chopped up into smaller and smaller pieces, but nobody really does that—
it’s messy. As a semantic convenience let’s agree that candy is indivisible, and, 
therefore, dividing candy is a discrete fair-division game.)
n mixed fair division. This is the case where some of the assets are continuous and 
some are discrete. Dividing an estate consisting of jewelry, a house, and a parcel 
of land is a mixed fair-division game.
Fair-division methods are classified according to the nature of the problem 
involved. Thus, there are discrete fair-division methods (used when the set S is 
made up of indivisible, discrete objects), and there are continuous fair-division 
methods (used when the set S is an infinitely divisible, continuous set). Mixed 
fair-division games can usually be solved by dividing the continuous and discrete 
parts separately, so we will not discuss them in this chapter. We will start our 
excursion into fair-division methods with a classic method for continuous fair 
division.
Once again we go back to Henry, Tom, and Fred and their intention to split their 
partnership fairly. The method they adopt for the split seems pretty reasonable: 
One of the brothers divides the assets into three shares (s1, s2, and s3), and then 
they draw lots to determine the order in which they get to choose. The values of 
the shares are as shown in Table 1. Say the order is Henry first, Tom second, and 
Fred last. In this case Henry will undoubtedly choose s3, Tom will then choose s1, 
and Fred will end up with s2. This works out fine, as this gives a fair division of S. 
So far, so good.
Suppose, however, that the when they draw lots the order is Tom first, Henry 
second, and Fred last. In this case Tom will start by choosing s3. Now Henry has to 
choose between s1 and s2, neither of which is a fair share. In this case the method 
fails to produce a fair division. Since drawing lots does not guarantee that the final 
result will always be a fair division, it is not a fair-division method.

The Divider-Chooser Method
2
When two players are dividing a continuous asset, the standard method used is the 
divider-chooser method. This method is also known as “you cut; I choose,” and most 
of us have used it at some time or another when dividing a piece of cake, a sandwich, 
or a bowl of ice cream. As the name suggests, one player, called the divider, divides S 
into two shares, and the second player, called the chooser, picks the share he or she 
wants, leaving the other share to the divider.

The Mathematics of Sharing
Under the rationality and privacy assumptions introduced in Section 1, this 
method guarantees that both divider and chooser will get a share worth 50% or 
more of the total value of S. Not knowing the chooser’s likes and dislikes (privacy 
assumption), the divider can only guarantee himself a 50% share by dividing S into 
two halves of equal value (rationality assumption); the chooser is guaranteed a 50% 
or better share by choosing the piece she likes best.
On their first date, Damian and Cleo go to the county fair. They buy jointly a 
raffle ticket, and, as luck would have it, they win a half chocolate–half strawberry 
cheesecake.
Damian likes chocolate and strawberry equally well, so 
in his eyes the chocolate and strawberry halves are equal in 
value (Fig. 1). On the other hand, Cleo hates chocolate— 
she is allergic to it and gets sick if she eats any—so in her 
eyes the value of the cake is 0% for the chocolate half, 
100% for the strawberry part (Fig. 1). Once again, to ensure 
a fair division, we will assume that neither of them knows 
anything about the other’s likes and dislikes.
Let’s now see how Damian and Cleo might divide this 
cake using the divider-chooser method. Damian volunteers 
to go first and be the divider. His cut is shown in Fig. 2(a). 
Notice that this is a perfectly rational division of the cake 
based on Damian’s value system—each piece is half of 
the cake and to him worth one-half of the total value of  
the cake. It is now Cleo’s turn to choose, and her choice is 
obvious—she will pick the piece having the larger straw-
berry part [Fig. 2(b)].
The final outcome of this division is that Damian gets a 
piece that in his own eyes is worth exactly half of the cake, 
but Cleo ends up with a much sweeter deal—a piece that in 
her own eyes is worth about two-thirds of the cake. This is, 
nonetheless, a fair division of the cake—both players get 
pieces worth 50% or more. Mission accomplished!

Example 3 illustrates why, given a choice, it is always better to be the chooser 
than the divider—the divider is guaranteed a share worth exactly 50% of the total 
value of S, but with just a little luck the chooser can end up with a share worth 
more than 50%. Since a fair-division method should treat all players equally, both 
players should have an equal chance of being the chooser. This is best done by 
means of a coin toss, with the winner of the coin toss getting the privilege of mak-
ing the choice.
The divider-chooser method goes all the way back to the Old Testament: 
When Lot and Abraham argued over grazing rights, Abraham proposed, “Let us 
divide the land into left and right. If you go left, I will go right; and if you go right, 
I will go left” (Genesis 13:1–9).
But how do we implement the same idea when the division is among three, 
or four, or N players? In the next two sections we will discuss two different ways to 
extend the divider-chooser method to the case of three or more players.
81

The Mathematics of Sharing
The first important breakthrough in the mathematics of fair division came in 1943, 
when the Polish mathematician Hugo Steinhaus came up with a clever way to extend 
some of the ideas in the divider-chooser method to the case of three players, one of 
whom plays the role of the divider and the other two who play the role of choosers.
Steinhaus’s approach was subsequently generalized to any number of players 
N (one divider and N - 1 choosers) by Princeton mathematician Harold Kuhn.
In either case we will refer to this method as the lone-divider method.
We start this section with a description of Steinhaus’s lone-divider method for 
the case of N = 3 players. We will describe the process in terms of dividing a cake, a 
commonly used and convenient metaphor for a continuous asset.
The lone-Divider method for Three Players
n Step 0 (Preliminaries). One of the three players will be the divider; the other 
two players will be choosers. Since it is better to be a chooser than a divider, the 
decision of who is what is made by a random draw (rolling dice, drawing cards 
from a deck, etc.). For convenience we’ll call the divider D and the choosers C1 
and C2.
n Step 1 (Division). The divider D divides the cake into three shares (s1, s2, and s3).
D will get one of these shares, but at this point does not know which one. Not 
knowing which share will be his (privacy assumption) forces D to divide the 
cake into three shares of equal value (rationality assumption).
n Step 2 (Bidding). C1 declares (usually by writing on a slip of paper) which of the 
three pieces are fair shares to her. Independently, C2 does the same. These are 
the bids. A chooser’s bid must list every single piece that he or she considers to 
be a fair share (i.e., worth one-third or more of the cake)—it may be tempting 
to bid only for the very best piece, but this is a strategy that can easily backfire. 
To preserve the privacy requirement, it is important that the bids be made inde-
pendently, without the choosers being privy to each other’s bids.
n Step 3 (Distribution). Who gets which piece? The answer, of course, depends on 
which pieces are listed in the bids. For convenience, we will separate the pieces 
into two types: C-pieces (these are pieces chosen by either one or both of the 
choosers) and U-pieces (these are unwanted pieces that did not appear in either 
of the bids). Expressed in terms of value, a U-piece is a piece that both choosers 
value at less than 33 1
3, of the cake, and a C-piece is a piece that at least one of 
the choosers (maybe both) values at 33 1
3, or more. Depending on the number 
of C-pieces, there are two separate cases to consider.
 
Case 1. When there are two or more C-pieces, there is always a way to give each 
chooser a different piece from among the pieces listed in her bid. (The details 
will be covered in Examples 4 and 5.) Once each chooser gets her piece, the 
divider gets the last remaining piece. At this point every player has received a 
fair share, and a fair division has been accomplished. (Sometimes we might end 
up in a situation in which C1 likes C2’s piece better than her own and vice versa. 
In that case it is perfectly reasonable to let them swap pieces—this would make 
each of them happier than they already were, and who could be against that?)
 
Case 2. When there is only one C-piece, we have a bit of a problem because it 
means that both choosers are bidding for the very same piece [Fig. 3(a)]. The 
solution here requires a little more creativity. First, we take care of the divider 
D—to whom all pieces are equal in value—by giving him one of the pieces that 
neither chooser wants [Fig. 3(b).] (If the two choosers can agree on the least 
desirable piece, then so much the better; if they can’t agree, then the choice of 
which piece to give the divider can be made randomly.)

The Mathematics of Sharing
 
 
After D gets his piece, the two pieces left (the C-piece and the remaining
U-piece) are recombined into one piece that we call the B-piece [Fig. 3(c)]. Now 
we have one piece and two players and we can revert to the divider-chooser 
method to finish the fair division: One player cuts the B-piece into two pieces; 
the other player chooses the piece she likes better [Fig. 3(d)].
 
 
This process results in a fair division of the cake because it guarantees fair 
shares for all players. We know that D ends up with a fair share by the very fact 
that D did the original division, but what about C1 and C2? The key observation 
is that in the eyes of both C1 and C2 the B-piece is worth more than two-thirds 
of the value of the original cake (think of the B-piece as 100% of the original 
cake minus a U-piece worth less than 33 1
3,), so when we divide it fairly into two 
shares, each party is guaranteed more than one-third of the original cake. We 
will come back to this point in Example 6.
We will now illustrate the details of Steinhaus’s lone-divider method for three 
players with several examples. In all these examples we will assume that the divider 
has already divided the cake into three shares s1, s2, and s3. In each example the 
values that each of the three players assigns to the shares, expressed as percentages 
of the total value of the cake, are shown in a table. The reader should remember, 
however, that this information is never available in full to the players—an individual 
player only knows the percentages on his or her row.

Dale, Cindy, and Cher are dividing a cake using Steinhaus’s lone-divider method. 
They draw cards from a well-shuffled deck of cards, and Dale draws the low card 
(bad luck!) and has to be the divider.
Step 1 (Division). Dale divides the cake into three pieces s1, s2, and s3. 
Table 2 shows the values of the three pieces in the eyes of each of the 
players.
Step 2 (Bidding). From Table 2 we can assume that Cindy’s bid list is 
5s1, s36 and Cher’s bid list is also 5s1, s36.
Step 3 (Distribution). The C-pieces are s1 and s3. There are two possi-
ble distributions. One distribution would be: Cindy gets s1, Cher gets s3, 
and Dale gets s2. An even better distribution (the optimal distribution) 
would be: Cindy gets s3, Cher gets s1, and Dale gets s2. In the case of the 
first distribution, both Cindy and Cher would benefit by swapping pieces, 
and there is no rational reason why they would not do so. Thus, using 
the rationality assumption, we can conclude that in either case the final  
result will be the same: Cindy gets s3, Cher gets s1, and Dale gets s2.

The Mathematics of Sharing
The lone-Divider method for more Than Three Players
In 1967 Harold Kuhn, a mathematician at Princeton University, extended Steinhaus’s 
lone-divider method to more than three players. The first two steps of Kuhn’s method 
are a straightforward generalization of Steinhaus’s lone-divider method for three 
players, but the distribution step requires some fairly sophisticated mathematical 
ideas and is rather difficult to describe in full generality. We will only give an outline 
here and will illustrate the details with a couple of examples.
n Step 0 (Preliminaries). One of the players is chosen to be the divider D, and 
the remaining N - 1 players are all going to be choosers. As always, it’s better 
to be a chooser than a divider, so the decision should be made by a random 
draw.
n Step 1 (Division). The divider D divides the set S into N shares s1, s2, s3, c, sN. 
D is guaranteed of getting one of these shares, but doesn’t know which one.
n Step 2 (Bidding). Each of the N - 1 choosers independently submits a bid list 
consisting of every share that he or she considers to be a fair share (in this case, 
this means any share worth 1
Nth or more of the total).
We’ll use the same setup as in Example 4—Dale is the divider, Cindy and 
Cher are the choosers.
Step 1 (Division). Dale divides the cake into three pieces s1, s2, and s3. 
Table 3 shows the values of the three pieces in the eyes of each of the 
players.
Step 2 (Bidding). Here Cindy’s bid list is 5s26 only, and Cher’s bid list is 
5s16 only.
Step 3 (Distribution). This is the simplest of all situations, as there is only 
one possible distribution of the pieces: Cindy gets s2, Cher gets s1, and 
     Dale gets s3.

The gang of Examples 4 and 5 is back at it again.
Step 1 (Division). Dale divides the cake into three pieces s1, s2, and s3. 
Table 4 shows the values of the three pieces in the eyes of each of the 
players.
Step 2 (Bidding). Here Cindy’s and Cher’s bid lists consist of just5s36.
Step 3 (Distribution). The only C-piece is s3. Cindy and Cher talk it over, 
and without giving away any other information agree that of the two 
U-pieces, s1 is the least desirable, so they all agree that Dale gets s1. (Dale 
doesn’t care which of the three pieces he gets, so he has no rational ob-
jection.) The remaining pieces (s2 and s3) are then recombined to form 
the B-piece, to be divided between Cindy and Cher using the divider-
chooser method (one of them divides the B-piece into two shares, the other 
one chooses the share she likes better). Regardless of how this plays out, both 
of them will get a very healthy share of the cake: Cindy will end up with a piece 
worth at least 40% of the original cake (the B-piece is worth 80% of the origi-
nal cake to Cindy), and Cher will end up with a piece worth at least 45% of the 
original cake (the B-piece is worth 90% of the original cake to Cher).

The Mathematics of Sharing
n Step 3 (Distribution). The bid lists are opened. Much as we did with three players, 
we will have to consider two separate cases, depending on how these bid lists 
turn out.
 
Case 1. If there is a way to assign a different share to each of the N - 1 choos-
ers, then that should be done. (Needless to say, the share assigned to a chooser 
should be from his or her bid list.) The divider, to whom all shares are presumed 
to be of equal value, gets the last unassigned share. At the end, players may 
choose to swap pieces if they want.
 
Case 2. There is a standoff—in other words, there are two choosers both bid-
ding for just one share, or three choosers bidding for just two shares, or K choos-
ers bidding for less than K shares. This is a much more complicated case, and 
what follows is a rough sketch of what to do. To resolve a standoff, we first set 
aside the shares involved in the standoff from the remaining shares. Likewise, 
the players involved in the standoff are temporarily separated from the rest. 
Each of the remaining players (including the divider) can be assigned a fair 
share from among the remaining shares and sent packing. All the shares left are 
recombined into a new piece to be divided among the players involved in the 
standoff, and the process starts all over again.
The following two examples will illustrate some of the ideas behind the lone-
divider method in the case of four players. The first example is one without a stand-
off; the second example involves a standoff.
Once again, we will let Demi be the divider and Chan, Chloe, and Chris be the three 
choosers (same players, different game).
 
Step 1 (Division). Demi divides the cake into four shares s1, s2, s3, and s4. 
Table 6 shows how each of the players values each of the four shares.
 
Step 2 (Bidding). Chan’s bid list is 5s46; Chloe’s bid list is 5s2, s36; Chris’s bid 
list is 5s46.
ExAmPlE 8  lonE DiviDER wiTh 4 PlAyERS (CASE 2)
We have one divider, Demi, and three choosers, Chan, Chloe, and Chris.
 
Step 1 (Division). Demi divides the cake into four shares s1, s2, s3, and s4.
Table 5 shows how each of the players values each of the four shares. Remem-
ber that the information on each row of Table 5 is private and known only to 
that player.
Step 2 (Bidding). Chan’s bid list is 5s1, s36; Chloe’s bid list is 5s36 
only; Chris’s bid list is 5s1, s46. (Keep in mind that with 4 players 
the threshold for a fair share is 25%.)
Step 3 (Distribution). The bid lists are opened. It is clear that for 
starters Chloe must get s3—there is no other option. This forces 
the rest of the distribution: s1 must then go to Chan, and s4 goes to 
Chris. Finally, we give the last remaining piece, s2, to Demi.
This distribution results in a fair division of the cake, although 
it is not entirely “envy-free”—Chan wishes he had Chloe’s piece 
(35% is better than 30%) but Chloe is not about to trade pieces 
with him, so he is stuck with s1. (From a strictly rational point of 
view, Chan has no reason to gripe—he did not get the best piece, but got a piece 
worth 30% of the total, better than the 25% he is entitled to.)

Step 3 (Distribution). The bid lists are opened, and the players can see 
that there is a standoff brewing on the horizon—Chan and Chris are 
both bidding for s4. The first step is to set s4 aside and assign Chloe 
and Demi a fair share from s1, s2, and s3. Chloe could be given either 
s2 or s3. (She would rather have s2, of course, but it’s not for her to 
decide.) A coin toss is used to determine which one. Let’s say Chloe 
ends up with s3 (bad luck!). Demi could be now given either s1 or s2.
Another coin toss, and Demi ends up with s1. The final move is . . . 
you guessed it!—recombine s2 and s4 into a single piece to be divided
between Chan and Chris using the divider-chooser method. Since 
(s2 + s4) is worth 60% to Chan and 58% to Chris (you can check 
it out in Table 6), regardless of how this final division plays out they are both 
guaranteed a final share worth more than 25% of the cake.
 
Mission accomplished! We have produced a fair division of the cake.
The Lone-Chooser Method
4
A completely different approach for extending the divider-chooser method was 
proposed in 1964 by A. M. Fink, a mathematician at Iowa State University. In this 
method one player plays the role of chooser, all the other players start out play-
ing the role of dividers. For this reason, the method is known as the lone-chooser 
method. Once again, we will start with a description of the method for the case of 
three players.
The lone-Chooser method for Three Players
n Step 0 (Preliminaries). We have one chooser and two dividers. Let’s call the 
chooser C and the dividers D1 and D2. As usual, we decide who is what by a 
random draw.
n Step 1 (Division). D1 and D2 divide S [Fig. 4(a)] between themselves into two fair 
shares. To do this, they use the divider-chooser method. Let’s say that D1 ends 
up with s1 and D2 ends up with s2 [Fig. 4(b)].
n Step 2 (Subdivision). Each divider divides his share into three subshares. Thus, 
D1 divides s1 into three subshares, which we will call s1a, s1b, and s1c. Likewise, 
D2 divides s2 into three subshares, which we will call s2a, s2b, and s2c [Fig. 4(c)].
n Step 3 (Selection). The chooser C now selects one of D1’s three subshares and 
one of D2’s three subshares [Fig. 4(d)]. These two subshares make up C’s final 
share. D1 then keeps the remaining two subshares from s1, and D2 keeps the 
remaining two subshares from s2.

Why is this a fair division of S? D1 ends up with two-thirds of s1. To D1, s1 is 
worth at least one-half of the total value of S, so two-thirds of s1 is at least one-
third—a fair share. The same argument applies to D2. What about the chooser’s

share? We don’t know what s1 and s2 are each worth to C, but it really doesn’t 
matter—a one-third or better share of s1 plus a one-third or better share of s2 equals 
a one-third or better share of (s1 + s2) and, thus, a fair share of the cake.
The following example illustrates in detail how the lone-chooser method works 
with three players.
After a random selection, Cher gets to be the chooser and, thus, gets to sit out 
Steps 1 and 2.
 
Step 1 (Division). David and Dinah start by dividing the cake between them-
selves using the divider-chooser method. After a coin flip, David cuts the cake 
into two pieces, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Since Dinah doesn’t like pineapple, she 
will take the share with the most orange [Fig. 6(c)].
David, Dinah, and Cher are dividing the orange-pineapple cake shown in Fig. 5 us-
ing the lone-chooser method. The cake is valued by each of them at $27, so each of 
them expects to end up with a share worth at least $9.
Their individual value systems (not known to one another, but available to us as 
outside observers) are as follows:
n David likes pineapple and orange the same [Fig. 5(a)].
n Dinah likes orange but hates pineapple [Fig. 5(b)].
n Cher likes pineapple twice as much as she likes orange [Fig. 5(c)].

Step 2 (Subdivision). David divides his share into three subshares that in his 
opinion are of equal value. Notice that the subshares [Fig. 7(a)] are all the 
same size. Dinah also divides her share into three smaller subshares that in her

The Mathematics of Sharing
opinion are of equal value [Fig. 7(b)]. (Remember that Dinah hates pineapple. 
Thus, she has made her cuts in such a way as to have one-third of the orange in 
each of the subshares.)
The lone-Chooser method for N Players
In the general case of N players, the lone-chooser method involves one chooser C 
and N - 1 dividers D1, D2, c, DN-1. As always, it is preferable to be a chooser 
rather than a divider, so the chooser is determined by a random draw. The method 
is based on an inductive strategy—if you can do it for three players, then you can 
do it for four players; if you can do it for four, then you can do it for five; and so on. 
Thus, when we get to N players, we can assume that we can use the lone-chooser 
method with N - 1 players.
n Step 1 (Division). D1, D2, c, DN-1 divide fairly the set S among themselves, as 
if C didn’t exist. This is a fair division among N - 1 players, so each one gets a 
share he or she considers worth at least 
1
(N - 1)th of S.
n Step 2 (Subdivision). Each divider subdivides his or her share into N subshares.

clear what her choices will be: She will choose one of the two 
pineapple wedges from David’s subshares and the big orange- 
pineapple wedge from Dinah’s subshares.
The final fair division of the cake is shown in Fig. 9: 
David gets a final share worth $9 [Fig. 9(a)], Dinah gets a final 
share worth $12 [Fig. 9(b)], and Cher gets a final share worth 
$14 [Fig. 9(c)]. David is satisfied, Dinah is happy, and Cher is 
ecstatic.

n Step 3 (Selection). The chooser C finally gets to play. C selects one subshare 
from each divider—one subshare from D1, one from D2, and so on. At the end, 
C ends up with N - 1 subshares, which make up C’s final share, and each divider 
gets to keep the remaining N - 1 subshares in his or her subdivision.
When properly played, the lone-chooser method guarantees that everyone,  
dividers and chooser alike, ends up with a fair share (see Exercise 71).
In the next two sections we will discuss discrete fair-division methods—
methods for dividing assets consisting of indivisible objects such as houses, cars, 
art, jewels, or candy. As a general rule of thumb, discrete fair division is harder 
to achieve than continuous fair division because there is a lot less flexibility in 
the division process, and discrete fair divisions that are truly fair are only pos-
sible under a limited set of conditions. Thus, it is important to keep in mind that 
while both of the methods we will discuss in the next two sections have limita-
tions, they still are the best methods we have available. Moreover, when they 
work, both methods work remarkably well and produce surprisingly good fair 
divisions.
The method of sealed bids was originally proposed by the Polish mathematicians 
Hugo Steinhaus and Bronislaw Knaster around 1948. The best way to illustrate how 
this method works is by means of an example.
The Method of Sealed Bids
5
In her last will and testament, Grandma plays a little joke on her four grandchildren 
(Art, Betty, Carla, and Dave) by leaving just three items—a cabin in the mountains, 
a vintage 1955 Rolls Royce, and a Picasso painting—with the stipulation that the 
items must remain with the grandchildren (not sold to outsiders) and must be divided  
fairly among them. How can we possibly resolve this conundrum? The method of 
sealed bids will give an ingenious and elegant solution.
n Step 1 (Bidding). Each of the players makes a bid (in dollars) for each of the 
items in the estate, giving his or her honest assessment of the actual value of each 
item. To satisfy the privacy assumption, it 
is important that the bids are done inde-
pendently, and no player should be privy 
to another player’s bids before making 
his or her own. The easiest way to accom-
plish this is for each player to submit his 
or her bid in a sealed envelope. When all 
the bids are in, they are opened. The top 
three rows in Table 7 show each player’s 
bid on each item in the estate.
n Step 2 (Allocation). Each item will go 
to the highest bidder for that item. (If 
there is a tie, the tie can be broken with 
a coin flip.) In this example the cabin goes to Betty, the vintage Rolls Royce 
goes to Dave, and the Picasso painting goes to Art. Notice that Carla gets noth-
ing. Not to worry—it all works out at the end! (In this method it is possible for 
one player to get none of the items and another player to get many or all of the 
items. Much like in a silent auction, it’s a matter of who bids the highest.)

The Mathematics of Sharing
n Step 3 (First Settlement). It’s now time to settle things up. Depending on what 
items (if any) a player gets in Step 2, he or she will owe money to or be owed 
money by the estate. To determine how much a player owes or is owed, we first 
calculate each player’s fair-share value of the estate (bottom row of Table 7). A 
player’s fair-share value is found by adding that player’s bids and dividing the 
total by the number of players (in this case 4).
 
 
The fair-share values are the baseline for the settlements—if the total value 
of the items that the player gets in Step 2 is more than his or her fair-share value, 
then the player pays the estate the difference. If the total value of the items that 
the player gets is less than his or her fair-share value, then the player gets the 
difference in cash. Here are the details of how the settlement works out for each 
of our four players.
 
 
Table 8 illustrates how the first settlements are calculated. Take Art, for 
example. Art receives the Picasso painting, which he valued at $680,000. But his 
fair-share value is only $295,000, so Art must make up the difference of $385,000 
by paying it to the estate. Likewise, Betty gets the cabin for $450,000 but has 
to pay $160,000 to the estate. Carla is not getting any items, so she receives the 
full value of her share ($283,000) in cash from the estate. Dave gets the vintage 
Rolls, which he values at $92,000. Since he is entitled to a fair share valued at 
$270,000, the difference is given to him in cash from the estate.
 
 
At this point each of the four heirs has received a fair share, and we might 
consider our job done, but this is not the end of the story—there is more to 
come (good news mostly!). If we add Art and Betty’s payments to the estate and 
subtract the payments made by the estate to Carla and Dave, we discover that 
there is a surplus of $84,000! ($385,000 and $160,000 came in from Art and Betty 
respectively; $283,000 and $178,000 went out to Carla and Dave.)
n Step 4 (Division of the Surplus). The surplus is common money that belongs to 
the estate, and thus is to be divided equally among the players. In our example 
each player’s share of the $84,000 surplus is $21,000.
n Step 5 (Final Settlement).  Everything done up to this point could be done 
on paper, but now, finally, real money needs to change hands! Art gets the  
Picasso painting and pays the estate $364,000 ($385,000 - $21,000). Betty gets 
the cabin and has to pay the estate $139,000 ($160,000 - $21,000). Carla gets 
$284,000 in cash ($263,000 + $21,000). Dave gets the vintage Rolls Royce plus 
$199,000 ($78,000 + $21,000).
When two players are dividing a commonly owned discrete asset, one of them 
will end up with the asset and the other one must get an equivalent share of some-
thing, usually money. The method of sealed bids handles this situation nicely and 
provides a solution that makes both players happy (assuming, of course, that they 
are rational players). Consider the following example.

The Mathematics of Sharing
Auctions, Reverse Auctions, and negative Bidding
Most people are familiar with the principle behind a standard auction (we can thank 
eBay for that): A seller has an item of positive value (say a vintage car) that he is 
willing to give up in exchange for money, and there are bidders who are willing to 
part with their money to get the item. The highest bidder gets the item. In some 
situations the bidders are allowed to make only one secret bid (usually in writing) 
and the highest bidder gets the item. These types of auctions are called sealed-bid 
auctions. A good way to think of the method of sealed bids is as a variation of a 
sealed-bid auction.
The key idea behind the method of sealed bids is that for each item there is a 
sealed-bid auction in which the players are simultaneously sellers and bidders. The 
highest bidder for the item ends up being the buyer (of the other players’ shares), 
the other players are all sellers (of their shares). The twist is that a player doesn’t 
know whether he will end up a buyer or a seller until the bids are opened. Not 
knowing forces the player to make honest bids (if he bids too high he runs the risk 
of buying an overpriced item; if he bids too low he runs the risk of selling an item 
too cheaply).
The above interpretation of the method of sealed bids helps us understand how 
the method can also be used to divide negative-valued items such as chores and 
other unpleasant responsibilities (for lack of a better word let’s just call such items 
“baddies”). The only difference is that now we will model the process after a reverse 
auction. A reverse auction is the flip side of a regular auction: There is a buyer who 
wants to buy a service (for example repairing a leaky roof) and bidders who are will-
ing to provide for this service in exchange for cash. Here the lowest bidder gets the 
job (i.e., gets to sell his services to the buyer). The buyer pays because he doesn’t 
want to climb on the roof and risk breaking his neck, and the low bidder does the 
job because he wants the cash.
When we combine the basic rules for the method of sealed bids with the idea of 
a reverse auction, we have a method for dividing any discrete set of baddies. We will 
illustrate how this works in our next example.
Al and Betty are getting a divorce. The only joint property of any value is their 
house. Rather than hiring attorneys and going to court to figure out how to split up 
the house, they agree to give the method of sealed bids a try.
Al’s bid on the house is $340,000; Betty’s bid is $364,000. The fair-share value 
of the “estate” is $170,000 to Al and $182,000 to Betty. Since 
Betty is the higher bidder, she gets to keep the house and 
must pay Al cash for his share. The computation of how 
much cash Betty pays Al can be done in two steps. In the 
first settlement, Betty owes the estate $182,000. Of this 
money, $170,000 pays for Al’s fair share, leaving a surplus 
of $12,000 to be split equally between them. The bottom 
line is that Betty ends up paying $176,000 to Al for his share 
of the house. Table 9 summarizes the split.
The method of sealed bids can provide an excellent so-
lution not only to settlements of property in a divorce but 
also to the equally difficult and often contentious issue of 
splitting up a partnership. The catch is that in these kinds of 
splits we can rarely count on the rationality assumption to 
hold. A divorce or partnership split devoid of emotion, spite, and hard feelings is a 
rare thing indeed!

The Mathematics of Sharing
Whether we are dividing assets (“goodies”) or chores (“baddies”), the method 
of sealed bids offers an elegant and effective solution to the problem of fair division. 
There are, however, two limitations to the method of sealed bids:
 1. Players must have enough money to properly play the game. A player that is 
cash strapped is at a disadvantage—he may not be able to make the right bids if 
he cannot back them up. (So, if you are the poor grandson dividing grandma’s 
estate with a bunch of fat-cat cousins, you may want to argue for something 
other than the method of sealed bids.)
 2. Players must accept the fact that all assets are marketable commodities (i.e., the 
principle that “everything has a price”). When there is an item that more than 
one player considers “priceless” (some kind of family heirloom, for example), 
then there are serious issues that the method of sealed bids cannot resolve.
ExAmPlE 12  APARTmEnT ClEAnuP 101
Anne, Belinda, and Clara are college roommates. The 
school year just ended, and they are getting ready to move 
out of their apartment. They talk to their landlord about 
getting their $1200 cleaning deposit back, and he tells 
them that there are five major chores that they need to do 
to get their cleaning deposit (or at least most of it) back. 
Table 10 lists the five chores as well as the bids that each 
roommate made for each chore. Remember that now the 
bids represent bids for services provided. (When Anne 
bids $90 for washing the windows she is saying something 
like “I am willing to wash the windows if I can get $90 in 
credit toward the final settlement on the cleaning deposit. 
If someone else wants to do it for less that’s fine—let 
them do it.”)
The fair division of the chores is summarized in 
Table 11. Since this is a reverse auction, each chore 
is assigned to the lowest bidder. Anne 
ends up with chore 4, Belinda ends up 
with chores 3 and 5, and Clara ends up 
with chores 1 and 2. In the first settle-
ment Anne has to “pay” $105 (no money 
is changing hands yet—this is just a debit 
on the final settlement of the cleaning de-
posit); Belinda gets a credit of $70; and 
Clara has a debit of $40. The details of the 
calculations are shown in Table 11. There 
is a surplus of $75, so each roommate gets 
a surplus credit of $25.
The final settlement: Because they did 
such a good job, Anne, Belinda, and Clara 
get their full $1200 cleaning deposit back. 
The money is divided as follows:
n Anne, who shampooed the carpets, gets $320.
 
[$400 (share of cleaning deposit) + $25 (surplus credit) - $105 (settlement debit)]
n Belinda, who painted walls and cleaned windows, gets $495.
 
[$400 (share of cleaning deposit) + $25 (surplus credit) + $70 (settlement credit)]
n Clara, who cleaned the bathrooms and the kitchen, gets $385.

The Mathematics of Sharing
Fine-Grained, Discrete Fair Division
Under the right set of circumstances, a discrete fair-division problem can be solved 
using continuous fair-division methods. This happens when the set of assets consists 
of many items with plenty of relatively low-valued items to “smooth” out the divi-
sion. We call these situations “fine-grained” fair-division games. To clarify the idea, 
imagine that you have a large pile of rocks and you want to split the rocks into three 
piles of equal weight. If all you have is big boulders then it is not very likely you will 
be able to do it, but if you also have a big supply of small rocks (the fine grain, so 
to speak) then your chances of making three piles of equal weight are quite good.
Using continuous fair-division methods to solve discrete fair-division problems 
is very helpful—continuous fair-division is easier and has fewer restrictions than 
discrete fair division. Our next example illustrates how we can use a continuous fair-
division method to solve a fine-grained, discrete fair-division problem. It also brings 
us back full circle to the story of the Elghanayan brothers.
In 2009, Henry, Tom and Fred Elghanayan agreed to break up Rockrose Devel-
opment Corporation, the $3-billion New York City real estate empire they jointly 
owned (about 8000 apartments, 9 office towers, and 9 major development projects). 
The breakup was reasonably amicable (there were a few bruised egos but no hard 
feelings), and each of the three brothers ended up with a share that he considered 
fair. How did they do it?
First, notice that because of the large number of apartments (the small rocks), 
this is an example of a fine-grained, discrete, fair-division problem. Thus, it was 
possible to divide the assets into three shares using a variation of the lone-divider 
method. Fred ended up as the divider (how he ended up with that dubious honor 
will be explained soon), and his task was to divide the assets into three “piles” of 
equal value. After Fred was finished with the division (it took him about 60 days to 
make up the three piles) a coin flip was used to determine which of the other two 
brothers (the choosers) would get to choose first. Henry won the coin flip, and this 
determined the order of choice: Henry first, Tom second, Fred last.
As in any lone-divider strategy, being the divider is the least desirable role, 
and to determine who would end up in that role the brothers used a variation of 
the method of sealed bids: a reverse auction in which the lowest bidder for the as-
sets (Fred) got to be the divider. This insured that both choosers valued the assets 
at a higher rate than the divider and guaranteed that Fred, knowing that he would 
choose last, would divide the assets into three approximately equal shares.
The most important postscript to this story is that all three brothers were happy 
with the outcome of the split, a very uncommon ending to such a big stakes division.

The Method of Markers
6
The method of markers is a discrete fair-division method proposed in 1975 by
William F. Lucas, a mathematician at the Claremont Graduate School. The method 
has the great virtue that it does not require the players to put up any of their own 
money. On the other hand, unlike the method of sealed bids, this method can only 
be used effectively in the case of a fine-grained, discrete, fair-division game.
In this method we start with the items lined up in a random but fixed sequence 
called an array. Each of the players then gets to make an independent bid on the 
items in the array. A player’s bid consists of dividing the array into segments of con-
secutive items (as many segments as there are players) so that each of the segments 
represents a fair share of the entire set of items.

The Mathematics of Sharing
Alice, Bianca, Carla, and Dana want to divide their joint-
ly owned post-Halloween stash of candy (Fig. 10). Their 
teacher, Mrs. Jones, offers to divide the candy for them, 
but the students reply that they just learned about a cool 
fair-division game they want to try, and they can do it 
themselves, thank you.
As a preliminary step, the 20 pieces are arranged 
in an array (Fig. 11). For convenience, we will label 
the pieces of candy 1 through 20. The order in which 
the pieces are lined up should be random (the easiest 
way to do this is to dump the pieces into a paper bag, 
shake the bag, and take the pieces out of the bag one at 
a time).
For convenience, we might think of the array as a string. Each player then “cuts” 
the string into N segments, each of which he or she considers an acceptable share. 
(Notice that to cut a string into N sections, we need N - 1 cuts.) In practice, one way 
to make the “cuts” is to lay markers in the places where the cuts are made. Thus, 
each player can make his or her bids by placing N - 1 markers so that they divide 
the array into N segments. To ensure privacy, no player should see the markers of 
another player before laying down his or her own.
The final step is to give to each player one of the segments in his or her bid. The 
easiest way to explain how this can be done is with an example.

n Step 1 (Bidding). Each student writes down independently on a piece of paper 
exactly where she wants to place her three markers. (Three markers divide the 
array into four sections.) The bids are opened, and the results are shown in 
Fig. 12. The A-labels indicate the position of Alice’s markers (A1 denotes her 
first marker, A2 her second marker, and A3 her third and last marker). Alice’s 
bid means that she is willing to accept one of the following as a fair share of the 
candy: (1) pieces 1 through 5 (first segment), (2) pieces 6 through 11 (second 
segment), (3) pieces 12 through 16 (third segment), or (4) pieces 17 through 
20 (last segment). Bianca’s bid is shown by the B-markers and indicates how 
she would break up the array into four segments that are fair shares; same for 
Carla’s bid (shown by the C-markers) and Dana’s bid (shown by the D-markers).

Bianca is done now, and her markers can be removed since they are no lon-

The Mathematics of Sharing
The ideas behind Example 14 can be generalized to any number of players. We 
now give the general description of the method of markers with N players and M 
discrete items.
n Preliminaries. The items are arranged randomly into an array. For convenience, 
label the items 1 through M, going from left to right.
n Step 1 (Bidding). Each player independently divides the array into N segments 
(segments 1, 2, c, N) by placing N - 1 markers along the array. These seg-
ments are assumed to represent the fair shares of the array in the opinion of that 
player.
n Step 2 (Allocations). Scan the array from left to right until the first first marker is 
located. The player owning that marker (let’s call him P1) goes first and gets the 
first segment in his bid. (In case of a tie, break the tie randomly.) P1’s markers 
are removed, and we continue scanning from left to right, looking for the first 
second marker. The player owning that marker (let’s call her P2) goes second 
and gets the second segment in her bid. Continue this process, assigning to each 
player in turn one of the segments in her bid. The last player gets the last seg-
ment in her bid.
n Step 3 (Dividing the Surplus). The players take turns in some random order and 
pick one item at a time until all the surplus items are given out.
n Step 3 (Dividing the Surplus). The easiest way to divide the surplus is to ran-
domly draw lots and let the players take turns choosing one piece at a time until 
there are no more pieces left. Here the leftover pieces are 5, 6, 10, and 11 (Fig. 
17). The players now draw lots; Carla gets to choose first and takes piece 11. 
Dana chooses next and takes piece 5. Bianca and Alice receive pieces 6 and 10, 
respectively.

11
FiGuRE 17 The surplus pieces (to be 
given randomly to the players one at a 
time) are a bonus.
Despite its simple elegance, the method of markers can be used only under 
some fairly restrictive conditions. In particular, the method assumes that every player 
is able to divide the array of items into segments in such a way that each of the seg-
ments has approximately equal value. This is usually possible in a fine-grained, fair-
division game, but almost impossible to accomplish when there is a combination of 
expensive and inexpensive items (good luck trying to divide fairly 19 candy bars plus 
an iPod using the method of markers!).

The Mathematics of Sharing
Problems of fair division are as old as humankind. One 
of the best-known and best-loved biblical stories is built 
around one such problem. Two women, both claiming to 
be the mother of the same baby, make their case to King 
Solomon. As a solution King Solomon proposes to cut 
the baby in two and give each woman a share. (Basically, 
King Solomon was proposing a continuous solution to 
a discrete fair-division problem!) This solution is totally 
unacceptable to the true mother, who would rather see 
the baby go to the other woman than have it “divided” 
into two shares. The final settlement, of course, is that 
the baby is returned to its rightful mother.
The problem of dividing an object or a set of objects 
among the members of a group is a practical problem 
that comes up regularly in our daily lives. When we are 
dividing a pizza, a cake, or a bunch of candy, we don’t 
always pay a great deal of attention to the issue of fair-
ness, but when we are dividing real estate, jewelry, or 
some other valuable asset, dividing things fairly becomes 
a critical issue.
This chapter gave an overview of an interesting and 
a surprising application of mathematics to one of the 
fundamental questions of social science—how to get hu-
mans to share in a reasonable and fair way.

The Divider-Chooser method
Exercises 15 and 16 refer to the following situation: Jared and 
Karla jointly bought the half meatball–half vegetarian foot-long 
sub shown in Fig. 20 for $8.00. They plan to divide the sandwich 
fairly using the divider-chooser method. Jared likes meatball 
subs three times as much as vegetarian subs; Karla is a strict veg-
etarian and does not eat meat at all. Assume that Jared just met 
Karla and has no idea that she is a vegetarian. Assume also that 
when the sandwich is cut, the cut is made perpendicular to the 
length of the sandwich. (You can describe different shares of the 
sandwich using the ruler and interval notation. For example, [0, 
6] describes the vegetarian half, [6, 8] describes one-third of the 
meatball half, etc.).

 32. Four players (Abe, Betty, Cory, and Dana) are dividing a 
pizza worth $18.00 among themselves using the lone-divider  
method. The divider divides the pizza into four shares 
s1, s2, s3, and s4. Table 23 shows the value of some of the 
slices in the eyes of each player.

Exercises 33 and 34 refer to the following situation: Jared, 
Karla, and Lori are planning to divide the half vegetarian–half 
meatball foot-long sub sandwich shown in Fig. 23 among them-
selves using the lone-divider method. Jared likes the meatball 
and vegetarian parts equally well; Karla is a strict vegetarian 
and does not eat meat at all; Lori likes the meatball part twice as 
much as the vegetarian part. (Assume that when the sandwich 
is cut, the cuts are always made perpendicular to the length of 
the sandwich. You can describe different shares of the sand-
wich using the ruler and interval notation—for example, [0, 6] 
describes the vegetarian half, [6, 8] describes one-third of the 
meatball half, etc.)

The lone-Chooser method
Exercises 35 through 38 refer to the following situation: Angela, 
Boris, and Carlos are dividing the vanilla-strawberry cake shown 
in Fig. 24(a) using the lone-chooser method. Figure 24(b) shows 
how each player values each half of the cake. In your answers 
assume that all cuts are normal “cake cuts” from the center to the 
edge of the cake. You can describe each piece of cake by giving 
the angles of the vanilla and strawberry parts, as in “15 straw-
berry–40 vanilla” or “60 vanilla only.”

The Mathematics of Sharing
 66. Angelina and Brad are planning to divide the chocolate-
strawberry cake shown in Fig. 41(a) using the divider-
chooser method, with Angelina being the divider. Suppose 
that Angelina values chocolate cake three times as much as 
she values strawberry cake. Figure 41(b) shows a generic 
cut made by Angelina dividing the cake into two shares s1 
and s2 of equal value to her. Think of s1 as an “x chocolate–
y strawberry” share. For each given measure of the angle x, 
find the corresponding measure of the angle y.
 
(b) Explain why under this method D1 is guaranteed a fair 
share.
 
(c) Illustrate with an example why under this method D2 is 
not guaranteed a fair share.
 62. Consider the following method for dividing a continuous 
asset S among three players:
 
 Step 1. Divider 1 (D1) cuts S into two pieces s1 and s2 
that he considers to be worth, 1
3 and 2
3 of the value of S,
respectively.
Step 2. Divider 2 (D2) gets a shot at s1. If he thinks that s1 
is worth 1
3 of S or less, he can pass (case 1); if he thinks that 
s1 is worth more than 1
3, he can trim the piece to a smaller 
piece s11 that he considers to be worth exactly 1
3 of S (case 2).
Step 3. The chooser C gets a shot at either s1 (in case 1) or at 
s11 (in case 2). If she thinks the piece is a fair share, she gets 
to keep it (case 3). Otherwise, the piece goes to the divider 
that considers it to be worth 1
3 (D1 in case 1, D2 in case 2).
Step 4. The two remaining players (D2 and C in case 1, D1 
and C in case 2, D1 and D2 in case 3) get to divide the “re-
mainder” (whatever is left of S) between themselves using 
the divider-chooser method.
 
 Explain why the above is a fair-division method that guar-
antees that if played properly, each player will get a fair 
share.
 63. Two partners (A and B) jointly own a business but wish to 
dissolve the partnership using the method of sealed bids. 
One of the partners will keep the business; the other will get 
cash for his half of the business. Suppose that A bids $x and 
B bids $y. Assume that B is the high bidder. Describe the 
final settlement of this fair division in terms of x and y.
 64. Three partners (A, B, and C) jointly own a business but wish 
to dissolve the partnership using the method of sealed bids. 
One of the partners will keep the business; the other two 
will each get cash for their one-third share of the business. 
Suppose that A bids $x, B bids $y, and C bids $z. Assume 
that C is the high bidder. Describe the final settlement of 
this fair division in terms of x, y, and z. (Hint: Try Exercises 
47 and 48 first.)
 65. Three players (A, B, and C) are sharing the chocolate-
strawberry-vanilla cake shown in Fig. 40(a). Figure 40(b) 
shows the relative value that each player gives to each of the 
three parts of the cake. There is a way to divide this cake 
into three pieces (using just three cuts) so that each player 
ends up with a piece that he or she will value at exactly 50% 
of the value of the cake. Find such a fair division.

 67. Standoffs in the lone-divider method. In the lone-divider 
method, a standoff occurs when a set of k choosers are bid-
ding for less than k items. The types of standoffs possible 
depend on the number of players. With N = 3 players, there 
is only one type of standoff—the two choosers are bidding 
for the same item. With N = 4 players, there are three pos-
sible types of standoffs: two choosers are bidding on the 
same item, or three choosers are bidding on the same item, 
or three choosers are bidding on just two items. With N = 5 
players, there are six possible types of standoffs, and the 
number of possible types of standoffs increases rapidly as 
the number of players increases.
 
(a) List the six possible types of standoffs with N = 5 play-
ers.
 
(b) What is the number of possible types of standoffs with 
N = 6 players?
 
(c) What is the number of possible types of standoffs with 
N players? Give your answer in terms of N. (Hint: You 
will need to use the formula for the number of pairwise 
comparisons among a set of objects.)
 68. Efficient and envy-free fair divisions. A fair division is 
called efficient if there is no other fair division that gives 
every player a share that is as good or better (i.e., any other 
fair division that gives some players a better share must give 
some other players a worse share). A fair division is called 
envy-free if every player ends up with a share that he or she 
feels is as good as or better than that of any other player.
 
Suppose that three partners (A, B, and C) jointly own 
a piece of land that has been subdivided into six parcels 
(s1, s2, c, s6). The partnership is splitting up, and the part-
ners are going to divide fairly the six parcels among them-
selves. Table 31 shows the value of each parcel in the eyes 
of each partner.

 70. Asymmetric method of sealed bids. Suppose that an estate 
consisting of M indivisible items is to be divided among 
N heirs 1P1, P2, c, PN2 using the method of sealed bids. 
Suppose that Grandma’s will stipulates that P1 is entitled 
to x1, of the estate, P2 is entitled to x2, of the estate, c, 
PN is entitled to xN, of the estate. The percentages add up 
to 100%, but they are not all equal (Grandma loved some 
grandchildren more than others). Describe a variation of 
the method of sealed bids that ensures that each player 
receives a “fair share” (i.e., P1 receives a share that she con-
siders to be worth at least x1, of the estate, P2 receives 
a share that he considers to be worth at least x2, of the 
estate, etc.).
 71. Lone-chooser is a fair-division method. Suppose that 
N players divide a cake using the lone-chooser method.
The chooser is C and the dividers are D1, D2, c, DN-1. 
Explain why, when properly played, the method guaran-
tees to each player a fair share. (You will need one argu-
ment for the dividers and a different argument for the 
chooser.)
 
(a) Find a fair division of the six parcels among the three 
partners that is efficient.
 
(b) Find a fair division of the six parcels among the three 
partners that is envy-free.
 
(c) Find a fair division of the six parcels among the three 
partners that is efficient but not envy-free.
 
(d) Find a fair division of the six parcels among the three 
partners that is envy-free but not efficient.

 69. Suppose that N players bid on M items using the method 
of sealed bids. Let T denote the table with M rows (one for 
each item) and N columns (one for each player) containing 
all the players’ bids (i.e., the entry in column j, row k rep-
resents player j’s bid for item k). Let c1, c2, c, cN denote, 
respectively, the sum of the entries in column 1, column 
2, c, column N of T, and let r1, r2, c, rM denote, respec-
tively, the sum of the entries in row 1, row 2, c, row M 
of T. Let w1, w2, c, wM denote the winning bids for items
 1 Envy-Free Fair Division
An envy-free fair division is a fair division in which each player 
ends up with a share that he or she feels is as good as or better 
than that of any other player. Thus, in an envy-free fair division 
a player would never envy or covet another player’s share. Over 
the last 20 years several envy-free fair-division methods have 
been developed.
Write a paper discussing the topic of envy-free fair division.
Notes: Some ideas of topics for your paper: (1) Discuss how 
envy-free fair division differs from the (proportional) type of 
fair division discussed in this chapter. (2) Describe a continu-
ous envy-free fair-division method for N = 3 players. (3) Give 
an outline of the Brams-Taylor method for continuous envy-free 
fair division for any number of players.
 2 Fair Divisions with unequal Shares
All the fair-division problems we discussed in this chapter were 
based on the assumption of symmetry (i.e., all players have equal 
rights in the division). Sometimes, players are not all equal and 
are entitled to larger or smaller shares than other players. This 
type of fair-division problem is called an asymmetric fair divi-
sion (asymmetric means that the players are not all equal in their 
rights). For example, Grandma’s will may stipulate that her es-
tate is to be divided as follows: Art is entitled to 25%, Betty is 
entitled to 35%, Carla is entitled to 30%, and Dave is entitled 
to 10%. (After all, it is her will, and if she wants to be difficult, 
she can!)
Write a paper discussing how some of the fair-division 
methods discussed in this chapter can be adapted for the case of 
asymmetric fair division. Discuss at least one discrete and one 
continuous asymmetric fair-division method.

Apportionment
Making the Rounds
April 1, 2010 was not just any ordinary April Fool’s Day. With an 
exquisite sense of irony, the United States Census Bureau desig-
nated April 1 as “Census Day” for the 2010 Census—the day 
when the population of the United States was officially counted. 
And indeed it was—there seemed to be around 308,745,538 of 
us going about our business that day

he Constitution mandates that every 10 years—on years ending with a 0— 
the government produce a “head count” of the U.S. population, broken 
down by state. (The modern version of the U.S. Census does a lot more than 
count heads, but at the moment we will focus on just the state population.) The key 
purpose of the state population numbers is to meet the constitutional requirement of 
“proportional representation.” The Constitution requires that seats in the U.S. House 
of Representatives be “apportioned among the . . . States according to their respective 
Numbers,” so every 10 years two things must happen: (a) the state populations must be 
determined (that’s the Census part), and (b) the seats in the House of Representatives 
must be apportioned to the states based on their populations (that’s the “apportion-
ment” part). It doesn’t sound all that complicated, does it? You will be surprised!
This chapter is an excursion into the mathematics behind the apportionment 
part, and it contains many interesting twists and turns. There are also a lot of parallels 
between apportionment and voting. We will start the chapter with an introduc-
tion to the basic concepts of apportionment: What is an apportionment prob-
lem? What are the elements common to all apportionment problems? What is an 
apportionment method? In Sections 2 through 4 we will introduce four classic 
apportionment methods named after four famous figures in 
American history: Hamilton’s method, Jefferson’s method, 
Adams’s method, and Webster’s method. In Section 5 we 
will discuss the Huntington-Hill apportionment method, 
the method currently used for the apportionment of 
the House of Representatives. Finally, in Section 6 
we will discuss the flaws and paradoxes of the various  
apportionment methods, concluding with an important  
result known as the Balinski-Young Impossibility 
Theorem.
T
Representatives . . . shall 
be apportioned among 
the several States . . . 
according to their respec-
tive Numbers. The actual 
Enumeration shall be

Years . . .

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Obviously, the verb apportion is the key word in this chapter. There are two critical 
elements in the dictionary definition of the word: (1) We are dividing and sharing 
things, and (2) we are doing this on a proportional basis and in a planned, organized 
fashion.
We will start this section with a pair of examples that illustrate the nature of the 
problem we are dealing with. These examples will raise several questions, but the 
answers will come later.
Apportionment Problems  
and Apportionment Methods
1
Example 1 shows all the elements of an apportionment problem—there are ob-
jects to be divided (the pieces of candy), and there is a proportionality criterion 
for the division (number of minutes worked during the week). We will say that the 
pieces of candy are apportioned to the kids, and we will describe the final solution 
as an apportionment (Alan’s apportionment is x pieces, Betty’s apportionment is y 
pieces, etc.).
Let’s now consider a seemingly different apportionment problem.
*By permission. From Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate® Dictionary, 11th Edition ©2012 by Merriam-
Webster, Incorporated (www.Merriam-Webster.com).
Mom has a total of 50 identical pieces of candy (let’s say caramels), which she is 
planning to divide among her five children (this is the “divide and share” part). 
Like any good mom, she is intent on doing this fairly. Of course, the easiest thing 
to do would be to give each child 10 caramels—by most standards, that would be 
fair. Mom, however, is thinking of the long-term picture—she wants to teach her 
children about the value of work and about the relationship between work and 
reward. This leads her to the following idea: She announces to the kids that the 
candy is going to be divided at the end of the week in proportion to the amount of 
time each of them spends helping with the weekly kitchen chores—if you worked 
twice as long as your brother you get twice as much candy, and so on (this is the 
“proportionate” division part). Unwittingly, mom has turned this division problem 
into an apportionment problem.
At the end of the week, the numbers are in. Table 1 shows the amount of work 
done by each child during the week. (Yes, mom did keep up-to-the-minute records!)
ExamplE 1  KitchEn capitalism
According to the ground rules, Alan, who worked 150 out of a total of 900 
minutes, should get 8 1
3 pieces. (Setting up the proportion 
150
900 =
x
50 and solving for x 
gives x = 8 1
3.) Here comes the problem: Since the pieces of candy are indivisible, 
it is impossible for Alan to get his 8 1
3 pieces—he can get 8 pieces (and get shorted) 
or he can get 9 pieces (and someone else will get shorted). A similar problem oc-
curs with each of the other children. Betty’s exact fair share should be 4 1
3 pieces; 
Connie’s should be 9 11
18 pieces; Doug’s, 11 1
3 pieces; and Ellie’s, 16 7
18 pieces. (Be sure 
to double-check these figures!) Because none of these shares can be realized, an 
absolutely fair apportionment of the candy is going to be impossible. What should 
mom do?

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Example 2 is another example of an apportionment problem—here the 
objects being divided are the 50 seats in the Intergalactic Congress, and the pro-
portionality criterion is population. But there is more to it than that. The observant 
reader may have noticed that the numbers in Examples 1 and 2 are identical—it 
is only the framing of the problem that has changed. Mathematically speaking, 
Examples 1 and 2 are one and the same apportionment problem—solve either one 
and you have solved both!
apportionment: basic concepts and terminology
Between the extremes of apportioning the seats in the Intergalactic Congress of Uto-
pia (important, but too far away!) and apportioning the candy among the children in 
the house (closer to home, but the galaxy will not come to an end if the apportion-
ments aren’t done right!) fall many other, real-life problems that are both important 
and relevant: assigning classrooms to departments in a university, assigning nurses 
to shifts in a hospital, etc. But the gold standard for apportionment applications is 
the allocation of seats to “states” in a legislature, and, thus, it is standard practice to 
borrow the terminology of legislative apportionment and apply it to apportionment 
problems in general.
The basic elements of every apportionment problem are as follows:
■ the “states.” This is the term we will use to describe the parties having a stake 
in the apportionment. Unless they have specific names (Alanos, Betta, etc.), we 
will use A, B, C, etc. to denote the states. Note that the “states” can be districts, 
counties, planets, and even people.
■ the “seats.” This term describes the set of M identical, indivisible objects that 
are being divided among the N states. For convenience, we will assume that 
there are more seats than there are states, thus ensuring that every state can 
potentially get a seat. (This assumption does not imply that every state must get 
a seat! Such a requirement is not part of the general apportionment problem, 
although it is part of the constitutional requirements for the apportionment of 
the U.S. House of Representatives.)
■ the “populations.” This is a set of N positive numbers (for simplicity we 
will assume that they are whole numbers) that are used as the basis for the 
apportionment of the seats to the states. We will use p1, p2, c, pN to de-
note the states’ respective populations and P to denote the total population 
1P = p1 + p2 + g + pN2.
It is the year 2525, and all the planets in the Utopia galaxy have finally signed a 
peace treaty. Five of the planets (Alanos, Betta, Conii, Dugos, and Ellisium) decide 
to join forces and form an Intergalactic Federation. The Federation will be ruled by 
an Intergalactic Congress consisting of 50 “elders,” and the 50 seats in the Interga-
lactic Congress are to be apportioned among the planets according to their respec-
tive populations.
The population data for each of the planets (in billions) are shown in Table 2.  
Based on these population figures, what is the correct apportionment of seats to 
each planet?

The Mathematics of Apportionment
■ an apportionment method. A systematic procedure that guarantees a division of 
the M seats (no more or no less) to the N states using some formula that is based 
on the state populations.
We now formally define several important concepts that we will use throughout 
this chapter.
■ the standard divisor (SD ). This is the ratio of population to seats (SD = P
M). It 
gives us a unit of measurement (SD people = 1 seat) for our apportionment 
calculations.
■ the standard quotas. The standard quota of a state (sometimes called the fair 
quota) is the exact fractional number of seats that the state would get if frac-
tional seats were allowed. We will use the notation q1, q2, c, qN to denote the 
standard quotas of the respective states. To find a state’s standard quota, we di-
vide the state’s population by the standard divisor (for a state with population p, 
its standard quota is q =
p
SD). In general, the standard quotas can be expressed 
as decimals or fractions—it would be almost a miracle if one of them turned 
out to be a whole number—and when using the decimal form, it’s customary to 
round them to two or three decimal places.
■ Upper and lower quotas. Associated with each standard quota are two other 
important numbers—the lower quota (the standard quota rounded down) and 
the upper quota (the standard quota rounded up). In the unlikely event that 
the standard quota is a whole number, the lower and upper quotas are the 
same. We will use L’s to denote lower quotas and U’s to denote upper quotas. 
For example, the standard quota q = 32.92 has lower quota L = 32 and upper 
quota U = 33.
We will now introduce the most important apportionment example of this chapter. 
We will return to this example many times. While the story behind the example is 
obviously fiction, the issues it raises are very real.
Parador is a small republic located in Central America and consists of six states: 
Azucar, Bahia, Cafe, Diamante, Esmeralda, and Felicidad (A, B, C, D, E, and F for 
short). There are 250 seats in the Congress, which, according to the laws of Parador, 
are to be apportioned among the six states in proportion to their respective popula-
tions. What is the “correct” apportionment?
Table 3 shows the population figures for the six states according to the 
most recent census.
ExamplE 3  thE congrEss of parador
The first step we will take to tackle this apportionment problem is to com-
pute the standard divisor (SD). In the case of Parador, the standard divisor is
SD =
12,500,000
250
= 50,000. (Typically, the standard divisor is not going to turn out to be 
such a nice whole number, but it is always going to be a rational number.)
The standard divisor SD = 50,000 tells us that in Parador, each seat in the 
Congress corresponds to 50,000 people. We can now use this yardstick to find 
the number of seats that each state should get by the proportionality criterion—all 
we have to do is divide the state’s population by 50,000. These are the standard 
quotas. For example, take state A. If we divide the population of A by 50,000, we get

The Mathematics of Apportionment
q1 =
1,646,000
50,000 = 32.92. If seats in the Congress could be apportioned in fractional 
parts, then the fair apportionment to A would be 32.92 seats, but, of course, this is 
impossible—seats in the Congress are indivisible objects! Thus, the standard quota 
of 32.92 is a number that we cannot meet, although in this case we might be able to 
come close to it: The next best solution might be to apportion 33 seats to state A. 
Hold that thought!
Table 4 shows the standard quotas for each of the states in Parador (rounded 
to two decimal places). Notice that the sum of the standard quotas equals 250, the 
number of seats being apportioned.
Standard quotas are the benchmark for a fair apportionment, but we must 
somehow convert these standard quotas to whole numbers. This is where the rub-
ber meets the road: How do we round the quotas into whole numbers?
At first glance, this seems like a dumb question. After all, we all learned in 
school how to round decimals to whole numbers—round down if the fractional part 
is less than 0.5, round up otherwise. This kind of rounding is called rounding to 
the nearest integer, or simply conventional rounding. Unfortunately, conventional 
rounding will not work in this example, and Table 5 shows why not—we would end 
up giving out 251 seats in the Congress, and there are only 250 seats to give out! 
(Add an extra seat, you say? Sorry, this is not a banquet. The number of seats is 
fixed—we don’t have the luxury of adding or subtracting seats!)
The most important moral of Example 3 is that conventional rounding of the 
standard quotas is not an apportionment method. It can end up apportioning more 
than M seats (as in Example 3) or less than M seats. Sometimes things do fall into 
place, and it ends up apportioning exactly M seats, but since this is not guaranteed, 
we can’t count on it as an apportionment method. So, what do we try next? For now, 
we leave this example—a simple apportionment problem looking for a simple solu-
tion—with no answers (but, we hope, with some gained insight!). Our search for a 
good solution to this problem will be the theme of our journey through the rest of 
this chapter.
Alexander Hamilton first proposed this method in 1792 as a way to apportion the 
U.S. House of Representatives (for more details see “A Brief History of Apportion-
ment in the United States” in the Conclusion). Hamilton’s method is also known as 
Vinton’s method and the method of largest remainders.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Hamilton’s method can be described quite briefly: Every 
state gets at least its lower quota. As many states as possible 
get their upper quota, with the one with highest residue (i.e., 
fractional part) having first priority, the one with second high-
est residue second priority, and so on. A little more formally, 
it goes like this:
■ step 1. Calculate each state’s standard quota.
■ step 2. Round the standard quotas down and give to 
each state its lower quota.
■ step 3. Give the surplus seats (one at a time) to the 
states with the largest residues (fractional parts) until 
there are no more surplus seats.
hamilton’s mEthod
As promised, we are revisiting the Parador Congress apportionment problem. We 
are now going to find our first real solution to this problem—the solution given by 
Hamilton’s method (we will call it the Hamilton apportionment). Table 6 shows all 
the details. (Reminder to the reader: The standard quotas in the second row of the 
table were originally computed in Example 3.) After each state receives its lower 
quota, there are 4 surplus seats left. These go to A first (0.92), D second (0.82),
F third (0.76), and B last (0.72). E and C get no extra seats.
ExamplE 4  parador’s congrEss (hamilton’s mEthod)
At first glance, Hamilton’s method appears to be a good method for apportion-
ing seats, but a careful look at Table 6 already shows hints of possible unfairness. 
Compare the fates of state B, with a residue of 0.72, and state E, with a residue of 
0.70. State B gets the last surplus seat; state E gets nothing! Sure enough, 0.72 is 
more than 0.70, so following the rules of Hamilton’s method, we give priority to B. 
By the same token, B is a huge state, and as a percentage of its population the 0.72 
represents an insignificant amount, whereas state E is a relatively small state, and its 
residue of 0.70 (for which it gets nothing) represents more than 5% of its population 
1 0.70
13.70  0.051 = 5.1,2.
It could be reasonably argued that Hamilton’s method has a major flaw in the 
way it relies entirely on the size of the residues without consideration of what those 
residues represent as a percent of the state’s population. In so doing, Hamilton’s 
method creates a systematic bias in favor of larger states over smaller ones. This 
is bad—a good apportionment method should be population neutral, meaning that
it should not be biased in favor of large states over small ones or vice versa.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
In Section 6 we will see that bias in favor of large states is only one of the many 
serious flaws of Hamilton’s method.
Our next example gives us a preview of some of the issues that can arise when 
using Hamilton’s method. The numbers used in the example are clearly made up, 
but the situation the example illustrates is very real.
The small country of Calavos consists of three states: Bama, Tecos, and Ilnos. With 
a total population of P = 200,000 and M = 200 seats in the House of Representa-
tives, we have an easy calculation of the standard divisor 1SD = 10002. With such a 
beautiful standard divisor (of course, the numbers are rigged!), we can quickly find 
the standard quotas (just divide the populations by 1000). Table 7 shows the details 
of the apportionment of the 200 seats under Hamilton’s method: Bama gets 10 seats, 
Tecos get 90 seats, Ilnos gets 100 seats.

■ tablE 7 Hamilton’s method with M = 200, SD = 1000
■ tablE 8 Hamilton’s method with M = 201, SD  995.02
Now we will ask ourselves what happens if the number of seats is increased to 
201, but nothing else changes. Since there is one more seat to give out, the appor-
tionment has to be recomputed. Table 8 shows the new apportionment for a House 
with 201 seats. First, we need to find the standard divisor. Here SD =
200,000
201
 995.02.
The standard quotas (rounded to two decimal places) are, respectively, 9.45, 90.75, 
and 100.8 (second row of Table 8). We now have two surplus seats, and they go to 
Ilnos first and Tecos second. Bama’s apportionment is now down to 9 seats (Table 8).
Strangely, when there were 200 seats to be apportioned, Hamilton’s method gave 
Bama 10 seats, but when the number of seats was increased to 201 Hamilton’s method 
gave Bama 9 seats. How could this happen? Notice the effect that the increase in the 
number of seats has on the size of the residues: In a House with 200 seats, Bama is at 
the head of the priority line for surplus seats, but when the number of seats goes up 
to 201, Bama gets shuffled to the back of the line. Welcome to the wacky arithmetic 
of Hamilton’s method!

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Our next method is attributed to Thomas Jefferson, who pro-
posed it as the right apportionment method for the U.S. House of 
Representatives in 1792. Jefferson’s method, as it is known in the 
United States, is also known as d’Hondt’s method and the method 
of greatest  divisors. (A more detailed account of the use of 
Jefferson’s method to apportion the U.S. House of Representa-
tives can be found in the section “A Brief History of Apportion-
ment in the United States” in the Conclusion.)
Jefferson’s method is based on an approach very different 
from Hamilton’s method, so there is some irony in the fact that 
we will explain the idea behind Jefferson’s method by taking one 
more look at Hamilton’s method.
Recall that under Hamilton’s method we start by dividing 
every state’s population by the standard divisor. This gives us 
the standard quotas. Step 2 is then to round every state’s quota 
down. Notice that up to this point Hamilton’s method uses a 
uniform policy for all states—every state is treated in exactly the 
same way. If you are looking for fairness, this is obviously good! But now comes 
the bad part (Step 3). We have some leftover seats which we need to distribute, 
but not enough for every state. Thus, we must choose some states over others for 
preferential treatment. No matter how fair we try to be about it, there is no getting 
around the fact that some states get extra seats and others don’t.
We saw in Example 5 that it is in the handling of the surplus seats (Step 3)  
that Hamilton’s method runs into trouble. So here is an interesting idea: Let’s tweak 
things so that when the quotas are rounded down, there are no surplus seats! (The 
idea, in other words, is to get rid of Step 3.) But under Hamilton’s method there is 
always going to be at least one surplus seat, so how do we work this bit of magic?  
The answer is by changing the divisor, which then changes the quotas. The idea is 
that by using a smaller divisor, we make the quotas bigger. If we hit it just right, 
when we round the slightly bigger quotas down cpoof! The surplus seats are 
gone. When we pull that bit of numerical magic, we have in fact implemented  
Jefferson’s method.
The best way to get a good feel for the inner workings of Jefferson’s method is 
through an example, so we will do that next.
Jefferson’s Method
3
Once again we are going to apportion the 250 seats in 
Parador’s Congress, this time using Jefferson’s method. 
For comparison purposes, we start with a review of 
how Hamilton’s method tackles this problem. The 
first two steps in Hamilton’s method are to compute 
the standard quotas (by dividing the populations by 
the standard divisor SD = 50,000) and then round 
them down to the lower quotas. These calculations are 
shown in Table 9. We know that there is a surplus of 4 
seats and that Step 3 of Hamilton’s method deals with 
that issue (but not too well!).
We will now try analogous calculations using a 
modified divisor d = 49,500 to divide the populations. 
This gives us different quotas, which we call modified 
quotas. The second column of Table 10 shows these

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Two questions come to mind when looking at Example 6: (1) Can we really sub-
stitute the standard divisor by some other random divisor?, and (2) if so, where did 
the divisor d = 49,500 come from? We will address each of these questions in order.
The answer to the first question is straightforward: Yes, we can use divisors 
other than the standard divisor! The standard divisor is a benchmark for a good 
apportionment, but we are not necessarily bound to it. If the intent is to round 
the quotas down and use the lower quotas for the apportionments, then the stan-
dard divisor is not a good choice because we will have surplus seats to deal with. 
By choosing the right divisor we can make the problem of surplus seats disap-
pear. One useful way to think about this change in divisors is as a change in the 
units of measurement. Instead of using 1 seat = SD people as our unit, we use 1 
seat = d people.
As far as the second question (how did we come up with the divisor d = 49,500 
in Example 6?), the short answer is that we used educated trial and error. Since our 
goal is to have no surplus seats, we must make the modified quotas bigger than the 
standard quotas. To do this we must divide the popula-
tions by a smaller number than the standard divisor. So 
we start with some number d 6 SD that is our first guess. 
Let’s say we make our first guess d = 49,000. Table 11 
shows the calculation of the modified and lower quotas 
for this divisor. Using this divisor we see that we overshot 
our target of 250 by 2 seats. This means that we made our 
divisor too small! So we try another number somewhere 
between 49,000 and 50,000. A reasonable second guess 
then is d = 49,500. This one we know works! (Fortunate-
ly, there is a full range of numbers that work as divisors, 
so it’s not like we have to hit a bullseye. In Example 6 any 
divisor d between 49,401 and 49,542 also works.)
modified quotas rounded to two decimal places (using a calculator it’s easy to check 
these numbers). When we round these modified quotas down (third column of 
Table 10) we end up with 250 seats—no leftovers! This is the apportionment accord-
ing to Jefferson’s method.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
The formal description of Jefferson’s method is surprisingly short. The devil is 
in the details.
■ step 1. Find a “suitable” divisor d.
■ step 2. Using d as the divisor, compute each state’s modified quota 
 
(modified quota = state population/d ).
■ step 3. Each state is apportioned its modified lower quota.
JEffErson’s mEthod
The hard part of implementing Jefferson’s method is Step 1. A flowchart outlin-
ing the trial-and-error approach for finding a divisor that works under Jefferson’s 
method is shown in Fig. 1.

Jefferson’s method is but one of a group of apportionment methods based on 
the principle that the standard unit (1 seat = SD people) is not an absolute require-
ment and that, if necessary, we can change to a different unit: 1 seat = d people, 
where d is a suitably chosen number. The number d is called a divisor (sometimes 
we use the term modified divisor to emphasize the point that it is not the standard 
divisor), and apportionment methods that use modified divisors are called divisor 
methods. Different divisor methods are based on different philosophies of how the 
modified quotas should be rounded to whole numbers, but they all follow one script: 
When you are done rounding the modified quotas, all M seats have been appor-
tioned (no more, and no less). To be able to do this, you just need to find a suitable 
divisor d. For Jefferson’s method, the rounding rule is to always round the modified 
quotas down. In the next two sections we will discuss other divisor methods based 
on different rounding rules.
adams’s method
Adams’s method (also known as the method of smallest divisors) was first proposed 
by John Quincy Adams in 1832 as a counterpoint to Jefferson’s method. In essence, 
Adams’s method is the mirror image of Jefferson’s method: Instead of rounding all 
quotas down to their lower quotas it rounds them up to their upper quotas. This is 
only possible if we use a modified divisor larger than the standard divisor so that the 
Adams’s and Webster’s Methods

modified quotas are smaller than the standard quotas. As with any divisor method, 
the trick is to find a divisor that works.
Once again, we will illustrate Adams’s method using the apportionment of 
Parador’s Congress.
■ step 1. Find a “suitable” divisor d.
■ step 2. Using d as the divisor, compute each state’s modified quota
 
(modified quota = state population/d ).
■ step 3. Each state is apportioned its modified upper quota.
adams’s mEthod
John Quincy Adams 
(1767–1848)
A very short description of Adams’s method (remarkably similar to that of 
Jefferson’s method) follows. It looks harmless enough, but Step 1 can take several 
tries. (Be patient and learn how to get the most out of your calculator.)
Webster’s method
What is the obvious compromise between rounding all the quotas down (Jefferson’s 
method) and rounding all the quotas up (Adams’s method)? What about conven-
tional rounding (round the quotas down when the fractional part is less than 0.5 and 
up otherwise)?
Our starting point is to find a suitable divisor d. In Adams’s method, the divisor d 
has to be bigger than the standard divisor SD = 50,000. Let’s make our first guess 
d = 50,500. Table 12 (third and fourth columns) shows the computations with this 
divisor. The total number of seats apportioned would be 251. This total is just one 
seat above our target of 250, so we need to make the quotas just a tad smaller. To do 
this, we must increase the divisor a little bit.
Let’s make our second guess d = 50,700. The new computations are shown in 
the last two columns of Table 12. This divisor works! The apportionment under 
Adams’s method is given in the last column of Table 12. The good news is that there 
are plenty of other d’s that work just as well (any number between 50,628 and 50,999 
will work as a divisor).

The Mathematics of Apportionment
It makes a lot of sense, but haven’t we been there before (Example 3) and 
found that conventional rounding is not an apportionment method? Yes, we have 
tried conventional rounding of the standard quotas and found it didn’t work, but 
we haven’t considered this approach using modified quotas. Now that we know 
that we can use modified divisors to manipulate the quotas, it is always possible 
to find a suitable divisor that will make conventional rounding work. This is the 
idea behind Webster’s method (also known as the Webster-Willcox method and the 
method of major fractions). Daniel Webster first proposed this method in 1832 (for 
details on the use of Webster’s method to apportion the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives see the section “A Brief History of Apportionment in the United States.” 
in the Conclusion).
■ step 1. Find a “suitable” divisor d.
■ step 2. Using d as the divisor, compute each state’s modified quota
 (modified quota = state population/d ).
■  step 3. Find the apportionments by rounding each modified quota to the 
 nearest integer (conventional rounding).
WEbstEr’s mEthod
To find a suitable divisor for Webster’s method we start with the standard divisor 
SD = 50,000 and compute the standard quotas (we already did this more than once, 
but there they are, once again, in the third column of Table 13). When we round the 
standard quotas to the nearest integer (fourth column of Table 13) we are unlucky 
and overshoot our target of 250 seats by just one seat. This means that we must 
bring the quotas down (by just a little) by using a slightly bigger divisor d. Let’s try 
d = 50,100. The modified quotas are now shown in the fifth column of Table 13, and 
when we round these to the nearest integer (last column of Table 13) we get what 
we want—a Webster apportionment of Parador’s Congress.
ExamplE 8  parador’s congrEss (WEbstEr’s mEthod)
Notice that the change that made the difference was very subtle and happened 
with state B, the largest state. The change of divisors dropped B’s standard quota 
from 138.72 to a new quota of 138.44. Dropping B’s decimal part to be under 0.5 
made all the difference—now B’s quota gets rounded down instead of up!

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Figure 2 shows a flowchart illustrating how to find a divisor d that works for 
Webster’s method. The main difference when we use trial and error to implement 
Webster’s method as opposed to Jefferson’s method (compare Figs. 1 and 2) is the 
choice of the first guess for d. With Webster’s method the first guess should be the 
standard divisor. Often (but not always) rounding the standard quotas to the nearest 
integer does work out. In such cases we have an easy apportionment using Web-
ster’s method. Unfortunately, there are times when the standard divisor SD doesn’t 
quite do the job. In such cases we proceed with the trial-and-error approach until we 
find a divisor that works.
As with the other divisor methods, 50,100 was just one of a range of numbers 
that work in this example. In fact, any number between 50,080 and 50,385 will work 
just as well.

Until 1940, the method used to apportion the U.S. House of Representatives was 
chosen by Congress every 10 years, typically for political reasons and with little 
consideration given to the mathematical subtleties of apportionment or to consis-
tency. Hamilton’s method, Jefferson’s method, and Webster’s method were all used 
at some time or another. Finally, in 1941 Congress passed, and President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt signed, “An Act to Provide for Apportioning Representatives in 
Congress among the Several States by the Equal Proportions Method,” generally 
known as the 1941 apportionment act. This act made two important changes in the 
process of apportioning the seats in the House of Representatives every 10 years: 
(1) the number of seats is permanently set at M = 435, and (2) the method of appor-
tionment is permanently set to be the Equal Proportions method, more commonly 
known as the Huntington-Hill method.
If for no other reason than the fact that the Huntington-Hill method is now the 
official method of apportionment for the U.S. House of Representatives, we will 
discuss the method in some detail in this section. The Huntington-Hill method is a 
sophisticated variation of Webster’s method, and in many cases it produces exactly 
the same apportionment as Webster’s method. At the same time, the two methods

are not equivalent, and in some cases they do produce different apportionments. We 
will give examples of both of these situations in this section.
But, first things first: The key to understanding the Huntington-Hill method is 
to understand how the quotas are rounded.
the geometric mean and the huntington-hill rounding rule
Under the Huntington-Hill method, quotas are rounded in a manner that is very 
similar to but not quite the same as the conventional rounding used in Webster’s 
method. For example, a quota of 2.48 would be rounded down to 2 in Webster’s 
method, but under the Huntington-Hill method 2.48 would be rounded up to 3. How 
come? Under the Huntington-Hill method, the cutoff point for rounding a quota 
down or up is a tad to the left of 0.5, and it varies with the size of the quota. For ex-
ample, if the quota is between 2 and 3, the cutoff point is c = 26  2.4495—quotas 
smaller than c get rounded down, quotas bigger than c get rounded up. Similarly, for 
a quota between 3 and 4 the cutoff point is c = 212  3.4641. To understand these 
unusual cutoff points for rounding we introduce the two key concepts in this section.
■ geometric mean The geometric mean G of two positive numbers a and b is the 
square root of their product: G = 2ab. (Note: The geometric mean of a and b 
always falls somewhere between a and b.)
■ huntington-hill rounding rule Given a quota q, the cutoff for rounding it is 
given by c = 2LU (i.e., the geometric mean of the lower quota L and the
upper quota U). In other words, if q 6 c, then round q down to L, and if q 7 c 
then round q up to U. (Note: You won’t have to worry about the case q = c. 
This can never happen because c is always an irrational number and q is always 
a rational number.)
The best way to understand how the Huntington-Hill rounding rule works is 
through an example.
In each case we will round the quota q up or down using the Huntington-Hill 
rounding rule. For convenience Table 14 shows cutoff points (and approxi-
mations to three decimal places) for all quotas between 1 and 10. [An (*) 
indicates when the rounding deviates from conventional rounding.]
■  q = 1.51. This quota gets rounded up to 2, just as it would under Webster’s 
method.
■  q = 1.41. This quota gets rounded down to 1, just as it would under Web-
ster’s method.
■  q = 1.42. (*) This quota gets rounded up to 2, because it is above the cutoff
    point c = 22  1.414.
■  q = 3.48. (*) This quota gets rounded up to 4, because it is above the cutoff
    point c = 212  3.464.
■  q = 5.48. (*) This quota gets rounded up to 6, because it is above the cutoff 
      point c = 230  5.477. Notice that here we are just barely above the cut-
off point, and we had to go to three decimal places to see the difference 
between the two numbers.
■  q = 6.48. This quota gets rounded down to 6, just as under conventional 
      rounding. It is below the cutoff point c = 242  6.481.
■  q = 42.49. Here we need to first calculate the cutoff point c. It is given by 
    the geometric mean of 42 and 43: c = 2(42)(43) = 21806  42.497. 
Since q is below the cutoff point, it gets rounded down to 42.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
A close look at Table 14 shows that the cutoff points for Huntington-Hill round-
ing seem to behave quite regularly. The following two facts are pretty useful:
■ The decimal part of the cutoff point is always smaller than 0.5, but not by much—
it always falls between 0.41 and 0.5.
■ The bigger the quota, the closer the decimal part of the cutoff point is to 0.5 
(and, thus, the more the rounding rule behaves like conventional rounding).
These two facts reinforce the observation that Huntington-Hill rounding is only 
a little bit “off center”: Quotas with decimal parts above 0.5 always get rounded up, 
quotas with decimal parts below 0.41 always get rounded down. There is only a very 
narrow window to the left of 0.5 where Huntington-Hill rounding is going to be dif-
ferent from conventional rounding.
the huntington-hill method
Once we understand the Huntington-Hill rounding rule, the description of the 
Huntington-Hill method is straightforward. In fact, it is very similar to the descrip-
tion of Webster’s method.
■ step 1. Find a “suitable” divisor d. [Here a suitable divisor means a divisor 
that produces an apportionment of exactly M seats when the quotas (popula-
tions divided by d) are rounded using the Huntington-Hill rounding rule.]
■ step 2. Find the apportionment of each state by rounding its quota using the 
 Huntington-Hill rounding rule.
hUntington-hill mEthod
We saw in Example 8 (Parador’s Congress using Webster’s method) that the stan-
dard divisor SD = 50,000 did not work, but that the modified divisor d = 50,100 
did. The modified quotas for this divisor are shown in the third column of Table 
15 (same quotas as in the fifth column of Table 13). We now need to round these 
quotas up or down using the Huntington-Hill rounding rules. The cutoff points for 
rounding are shown in the fourth column of Table 15, and, as is often the case, the 
rounding turns out to be exactly the same as under conventional rounding. The ap-
portionment under Huntington-Hill method is shown in the last column of Table 15 
and is exactly the same apportionment as under Webster’s method.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
Example 10 illustrates a fairly common situation: the same divisors that work 
for Webster’s method work for the Huntington-Hill method. In this case both meth-
ods produce exactly the same apportionment.
Our next two examples illustrate situations where the Huntington-Hill method 
and Webster’s method produce different apportionments. The numbers have been 
carefully rigged up to illustrate the mathematical subtlety of how this can happen.
Parador’s neighbor is the small republic of Guayuru. Guayuru consists of five states 
(A, B, C, D, and E for short). The populations of the five states are shown in the 
second column of Table 16. The Guayuru House of Representatives has a total of 
40 seats that are to be apportioned to the states using the Huntington-Hill method. 
Our starting point is to compute the standard divisor and the standard quotas, just 
as we do with Webster’s method. As luck would have it, the total population of 
Guayuru is 400,000, which makes the standard divisor SD = 10,000 and the calcula-
tion of the standard quotas particularly nice. The standard quotas are shown in the 
third column of Table 16. The fourth column of Table 16 shows the cutoff points 
for rounding under the Huntington-Hill rounding rules. When the standard quotas 
are rounded this way the total is 40 (last column of Table 16), and we have an ap-
portionment. Notice that both state A and state E get rounded up—the decimal 
parts of their quotas are under 0.5 but above the cutoff point. This apportionment is 
different from the one we would get using Webster’s method (the standard divisor 
would not work here and we would have to find a different divisor that does—see 
Exercise 40).
ExamplE 11  SD WorKs for hUntington-hill bUt not for WEbstEr
This example is a small variant of Example 11. There are a few small changes in the 
populations of the states, but the rest of the story is unchanged. The second col-
umn of Table 17 shows the new state populations: the populations of B and C have 
increased a little, the population of D has decreased. The total is still 400,000, and 
the standard divisor is still SD = 10,000. The standard quotas are shown in the third 
column of Table 17. When we round the standard quotas using the Huntington-Hill 
rounding rules (fourth column of Table 17), states B and C now get rounded up and 
the total number of seats is 42. This does not work, so we have to look for a different 
divisor. The divisor d = 10,030 brings all the quotas down a little. In particular, the 
quotas of B and E move to the left of their cutoff points and we get the Huntington-
Hill apportionment shown in the last column of Table 17. (Note: If we look at the 
standard quotas in the third column of Table 17 and round them using conventional 
rounding, we get the apportionment under Webster’s method: A gets 3 seats, B gets 
11, C gets 7, D gets 14, and E gets 5.)

The Mathematics of Apportionment
By and large, each of the apportionment methods we discussed in this chapter has 
both positive and negative features. Some methods are better than others, but none 
is flawless. In this section we will discuss the curious flaws that apportionment meth-
ods can exhibit and how they are reflected in the methods we studied.
The following discussion can be summarized by three key facts:
 1. Except for Hamilton’s method, all of the other methods discussed in this chap-
ter violate the quota rule.
 2. Hamilton’s method can produce apportionment paradoxes.
 3. It is impossible for an apportionment method to both satisfy the quota rule and 
not produce apportionment paradoxes.
violating the Quota rule
■ the Quota rule. An apportionment method should not apportion to a state less 
than L seats or more than U seats (where L and U denote, respectively, the 
lower and upper quotas for the standard quota).
The basic idea behind the quota rule is that the standard quota is the true mea-
sure of a fair apportionment, and a fair apportionment method, therefore, should 
not differ from the standard quota by more than one seat. For example, if a state has 
a standard quota of 138.72 then it is reasonable to apportion to that state 139 or 138 
seats, but never 140 seats or 137 seats.
■ Upper-quota violations. If an apportionment method apportions to a state more 
than U seats we say that it violates the upper quota. (For example, if the standard 
quota of a state is 138.72 and the state gets 140 seats, then we have an upper-
quota violation.)
■ lower-quota violations. If an apportionment method apportions to a state less than 
L seats we say that it violates the lower quota. (For example, if the standard quota of 
a state is 138.72 and the state gets 137 seats, then we have a lower-quota violation.)
We will now consider how the various methods we learned in this chapter fare 
with respect to the quota rule.
■ Hamilton’s method never violates the quota rule. The reason for this is that 
Hamilton’s method starts with the standard quotas, rounds all of them down, 
and then gives surplus seats to some states and not to others. The states that get

The Mathematics of Apportionment
apportionment paradoxes
Next, we will consider three important paradoxes that sometimes pop up in appor-
tionment problems: the Alabama paradox, the population paradox, and the new-
states paradox.
■ alabama paradox. This paradox occurs when a state gets apportioned fewer seats 
simply by virtue of the fact that the total number of seats being apportioned has in-
creased.
 
 
We already saw an example of the Alabama paradox in Example 5: Un-
der Hamilton’s method a fictitious state called Bama gets apportioned 10 seats 
when the total number of seats is M = 200, but only 9 seats when the total num-
ber of seats is increased to M = 201.
 
 
Of the apportionment methods we discussed in this chapter, only Hamil-
ton’s method can produce the quirky arithmetic behind the Alabama paradox: 
When we increase the number of seats to be apportioned, each state’s standard 
quota goes up, but not by the same amount. As the residues change, some states 
can move ahead of others in the priority order for the surplus seats. This can 
result in some state or states losing seats they already had.
[Historical note: The origin of the name Alabama paradox can be traced to the 
events surrounding the 1882 apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
As different apportionment bills for the House were being debated, it came to light 
that in a House with 299 seats, Alabama’s apportionment would be 8 seats, whereas 
in a House with 300 seats, Alabama’s apportionment would be 7 seats. The effect of 
adding that extra seat would be to give one more seat to Texas and one more seat to 
Illinois. To do this, a seat would have to be taken away from Alabama!]
■ population paradox. This paradox occurs when a state gets apportioned fewer 
seats simply by virtue of the fact that its population has increased. More specifi-
cally, the population paradox represents situations in which state X loses a seat 
to state Y even though X grew in population at a higher rate than Y.
Our next example illustrates how the population paradox can occur under 
Hamilton’s method.
a surplus seat end up with their upper quota and the states that don’t end up 
with their lower quota. In either case, the quota rule will not be violated.
■ Jefferson’s method can violate the upper quota. This is illustrated in Example 6 
(Parador’s Congress), where state B gets an apportionment of 140 seats even 
though its standard quota is 138.72. Under Jefferson’s method all quota viola-
tions are upper-quota violations [Exercise 71(a)], and these violations tend to 
happen with the larger states.
■ Adams’s method can violate the lower quota. This is also illustrated with the 
apportionment of state B in Parador’s Congress (Example 7): Under Adams’s 
method B gets an apportionment of 137 seats even though its standard quota is 
138.72. Under Adams’s method all quota violations are lower-quota violations 
[Exercise 71(b)], and they also tend to happen with the larger states.
■ Webster’s method and the Huntington-Hill method can violate the quota rule 
(here the violations can be either upper- or lower-quota violations). Quota vio-
lations under either method are pretty rare, but they can happen.
In the year 2525 the five planets in the Utopia galaxy finally signed a peace treaty 
and agreed to form an Intergalactic Federation governed by an Intergalactic Con-
gress. This is the story of the two apportionments that broke up the Federation.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
part i. the apportionment of 2525. The first Intergalactic Congress was apportioned 
using Hamilton’s method, based on the population figures (in billions) shown in the 
second column of Table 18. (This is the apportionment problem introduced in Ex-
ample 2.) There were 50 seats apportioned.
Let’s go over the calculations. Since the total population of the galaxy is 900 bil-
lion, the standard divisor is SD =
900
50 = 18 billion. Dividing the planet populations
by this standard divisor gives the standard quotas shown in the third column of 
Table 18. After the lower quotas are handed out (column 4), there are two surplus 
seats. The first surplus seat goes to Conii, and the other one to Ellisium. The last 
column shows the apportionments. (Keep an eye on the apportionments of Betta 
and Ellisium—they are central to how this story unfolds.)
part ii. the apportionment of 2535. After 10 years of peace, all was well in the In-
tergalactic Federation. The Intergalactic Census of 2535 showed only a few changes 
in the planets’ populations—an 8 billion increase in the population of Conii, and a 
1 billion increase in the population of Ellisium. The populations of the other planets 
remained unchanged from 2525. Nonetheless, a new apportionment was required. 
Table 19 shows the details of the 2535 apportionment under Hamilton’s method. 
Notice that the total population increased to 909 billion, so the standard divisor for 
this apportionment was SD =
909
50 = 18.18. (You might want to check all the calcula-
tions in Table 19 for yourself.)
The one remarkable thing about the 2535 apportionment is that Ellisium lost a seat 
while its population went up and Betta gained that seat while its population remained 
unchanged! The epilogue to this story is that Ellisium used the 2535 apportionment as 
an excuse to invade Betta, and the years of peace and prosperity in Utopia were over.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
■ new-states paradox. This paradox occurs when a state’s apportionment is af-
fected simply by virtue of the fact that a new state with its fair share of seats has 
been added to the computation.
[Historical note: In 1907 Oklahoma joined the Union. Prior to Oklahoma 
becoming a state, there were 386 seats in the House of Representatives. At the 
time the fair apportionment to Oklahoma was five seats, so the size of the House 
of Representatives was changed from 386 to 391. The point of adding these five 
seats was to give Oklahoma its fair share of seats and leave the apportionments 
of the other states unchanged. However, when the new apportionments were 
calculated. Maine’s apportionment went up from three to four seats and New 
York’s went down from 38 to 37 seats.]
Our last example gives a simple illustration of how the new-states paradox can 
occur under Hamilton’s method. For a change of pace, we will discuss something 
other than legislatures.
The Metro Garbage Company has a contract to provide 
garbage collection and recycling services in two districts of 
Metropolis, Northtown (with 10,450 homes) and the much 
larger Southtown (89,550 homes). The company runs 100 
garbage trucks, which are apportioned under Hamilton’s 
method according to the number of homes in the dis-
trict. A quick calculation shows that the standard divisor 
is SD = 1000 homes, a nice, round number which makes 
the rest of the calculations (shown in Table 20) easy. As 
a result of the apportionment, 10 garbage trucks are as-
signed to service Northtown and 90 garbage trucks to ser-
vice Southtown.
Now imagine that the Metro Garbage Company is 
bidding to expand its territory by adding the district of 
Newtown (5250 homes) to its service area. In its bid to the 
City Council the company promises to buy five additional 
garbage trucks for the Newtown run so that its service to 
the other two districts is not affected. But when the new 
calculations (shown in Table 21) are carried out, there is a 
surprise: One of the garbage trucks assigned to Southtown 
has to be reassigned to Northtown! (You should check 
these calculations for yourself. Notice that the standard divisor has gone up a little 
and is now approximately 1002.38.)

Table 22 summarizes the five apportionment methods of this chapter in terms 
of apportionment paradoxes and the quota rule. Of the five methods, Webster’s 
method and the Huntington-Hill method are in some sense the best because while in 
theory they can violate the quota rule, in practice this happens very rarely. From the 
purely mathematical point of view, the ideal apportionment method would be one 
that does not violate the quota rule and does not produce any of the apportionment 
paradoxes. In 1980 two mathematicians—Michel Balinski of the State University 
of New York at Stony Brook and H. Peyton Young of Johns Hopkins University—
were able to prove that such an apportionment method is a mathematical impossibil-
ity: If an apportionment method does not violate the quota rule, then apportionment 
paradoxes are possible; if an apportionment method does not produce apportionment 
paradoxes, then violations of the quota rule are possible. This fact, known as Balinski 
and Young’s Impossibility Theorem, forces us to accept the fact that all apportion-
ment methods have one flaw or another.

Apportionment is a problem of surprising mathematical depth—to say nothing of 
its political and historical complexities. Many of our Founding Fathers were deeply 
concerned with the issue, and the names of the apportionment methods we dis-
cussed in this chapter bear witness to this fact.
a brief his tory of apportionment in the United states
The apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives has an intriguing and con-
voluted history. As mandated by the United States Constitution, apportionments of 
the House are to take place every 10 years, following each census of the population. 
The real problem was that the Constitution left the method of apportionment and 
the number of seats to be apportioned essentially up to Congress. The only two re-
strictions stated in the Constitution were that (1) “each State shall have at least one 
Representative,” and (2) “The number of Representatives shall not exceed one for 
every thirty thousand” (Article I, Section 2).
Following the 1790 Census, and after considerable and heated debate, Congress 
passed the first “act of apportionment” in 1792. The bill, sponsored by Alexander 
Hamilton (then Secretary of the Treasury), established a House of Representa-
tives with M = 120 seats and apportioned under the method we now call Hamilton’s 
method. In April of 1792, at the urging of Hamilton’s archenemy and then 
Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, President George Washington vetoed the bill. 
(This was the first presidential veto in U.S. history.) Jefferson convinced Washington 
to support a different apportionment bill, based on a House of Representatives with 
M = 105 seats and apportioned under the method we now call Jefferson’s method. 
Unable to override the president’s veto and facing a damaging political stalemate, 
Congress finally adopted Jefferson’s apportionment bill. This is how the first House 
of Representatives came to be constituted.
Jefferson’s method remained in use for five decades, up to and including the 
apportionment of 1832. The great controversy during the 1832 apportionment de-
bate centered on New York’s apportionment. Under Jefferson’s method, New York 
would get 40 seats even though its standard quota was only 38.59. This apportion-
ment exposed, in a very dramatic way, the critical weakness of Jefferson’s method— 
it produces upper-quota violations. Two alternative apportionment bills were con-
sidered during the 1832 apportionment debate, one proposed by John Quincy  
Adams that would apportion the House using the method we now call Adams’s 
method and a second one, sponsored by Daniel Webster, that would do the same

using the method we now call Webster’s method. Both of these proposals were 
defeated and the original apportionment bill passed, but the 1832 apportionment 
was the last gasp for Jefferson’s method.
Webster’s method was adopted for the 1842 apportionment, but in 1852 Con-
gress passed a law making Hamilton’s method the “official” apportionment method 
for the House of Representatives. Since it is not unusual for Hamilton’s method 
and Webster’s method to produce exactly the same apportionment, an “unofficial” 
compromise was also adopted in 1852: Choose the number of seats in the House so 
that the apportionment is the same under either method. This was done again with 
the apportionment bills of 1852 and 1862.
In 1872, as a result of a power grab among states, an apportionment bill was 
passed that can only be described as a total mess—it was based on no particular 
method and produced an apportionment that was inconsistent with both Hamil-
ton’s method and Webster’s method. The apportionment of 1872 was in violation of 
both the Constitution (which requires that some method be used) and the 1852 law 
(which designated Hamilton’s method as the method of choice).
In 1876 Rutherford B. Hayes defeated Samuel L. Tilden in one of the most 
controversial and disputed presidential elections in U.S. history. Hayes won in the 
Electoral College (despite having lost the popular vote) after Congress awarded him 
the disputed electoral votes from three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and 
South Carolina. One of the many dark sidebars of the 1876 election was that, had 
the House of Representatives been legally apportioned, Tilden would have been the 
clear-cut winner in the Electoral College.
In 1882 the Alabama paradox first surfaced. In looking at possible appor-
tionments for different House sizes, it was discovered that for M = 299 Alabama 
would get 8 seats, but if the House size were increased to M = 300, then Alabama’s 
apportionment would decrease to 7 seats. So how did Congress deal with this dis-
turbing discovery? It essentially glossed it over, choosing a House with M = 325 
seats, a number for which Hamilton’s method and Webster’s method would give 
the same apportionment. The same strategy was adopted in the apportionment 
bill of 1892.
In 1901 the Alabama paradox finally caught up with Congress. When the 
Census Bureau presented to Congress tables showing the possible apportion-
ments under Hamilton’s method for all House sizes between 350 and 400 seats, 
it was pointed out that two states—Maine and Colorado—were impacted by the 
Alabama paradox: For most values of M starting with M = 350, Maine would get 
4 seats, but for M = 357, 382, 386, 389, and 390, Maine’s apportionment would go 
down to 3 seats. Colorado would get 3 seats for all possible values of M except
M = 357, for which it would only get 2 seats. For M = 357, both Maine and Colorado
lose, and, coincidentally, this just happened to be the House size that was pro-
posed for the 1901 bill. Faster than you can say “we are being robbed,” the debate 
in Congress escalated into a frenzy of name-calling and accusations, with the end 
result being that the bill was defeated and Hamilton’s method was scratched for 
good. The final apportionment of 1901 used Webster’s method and a House with 
M = 386 seats.
Webster’s method remained in use for the apportionments of 1901, 1911, and 
1931. (No apportionment bill was passed following the 1920 Census, in direct viola-
tion of the Constitution.)
In 1941 Congress passed a law that established a fixed size for the House of Rep-
resentatives (435 seats) and a permanent method of apportionment known as the 
method of equal proportions, or the Huntington-Hill method. The 1941 law (Public 
Law 291, H.R. 2665, 55 Stat 761: An Act to Provide for Apportioning Representatives 
in Congress among the Several States by the Equal Proportions Method) represented 
a realization by Congress that politics should be taken out of the  apportionment 
debate and that the apportionment of the House of Representatives should be pure-
ly a mathematical issue.

1 Apportionment Problems and Apportionment Methods
■ apportionment problem: any problem where M identical, indivisible objects (the 
“seats”) must be divided among N parties (the “states”) using some proportionality 
criterion (the “populations”)
■ states: a metaphor for the parties in an apportionment problem
■ seats: a metaphor for the identical, indivisible objects being apportioned
■ apportionment method: given M seats to be apportioned among N states, a method 
that guarantees a division of the M seats (no more and no less) to the N states based 
on their populations
■ standard divisor: the ratio of total population to number of seats being apportioned 
(i.e., SD = P>M)
■ standard quota (quota): for a state with population p, the ratio p>SD; it represents 
what the fair apportionment to the state would be if seats were divisible into frac-
tional parts
■ lower quota: the largest integer smaller or equal to the quota
■ upper quota: the smallest integer bigger or equal to the quota
2 Hamilton’s Method
■ Hamilton’s method: uses the standard divisor and standard quotas; first gives each 
state its lower quota, then gives out surplus seats according to the “remainders,” high-
est remainder first and so on
3 Jefferson’s Method
■ Jefferson’s method: a divisor method that produces an apportionment by using 
modified quotas that are always rounded down
■ divisor (modified divisor): a number d representing the yardstick for measuring 
seats in terms of populations (1 seat = d population members)
■ divisor method: any apportionment method that uses modified divisors and modi-
fied quotas for the apportionment calculations
■ modified quota: a quota obtained using a modified divisor
Are apportionment controversies then over? Not a chance. With a fixed-size 
House, one state’s gain has to be another state’s loss. In the 1990 apportionment 
Montana was facing the prospect of losing one of its two seats—seats it had held 
in the House for 80 years. Not liking the message, Montana tried to kill the mes-
senger. In 1991 Montana filed a lawsuit in federal District Court (Montana v. 
United States Department of Commerce) in which it argued that the Huntington-
Hill method is unconstitutional and that either Adams’s method or Dean’s method 
(see Project 1) should be used. (Under either of these methods, Montana would 
keep its two seats.) A panel of three federal judges ruled by a 2-to-1 vote in favor 
of Montana. The case then went on appeal to the Supreme Court, which over-
turned the decision of the lower federal court and upheld the constitutionality 
of the Huntington-Hill method. So, until either Congress or a different Supreme 
Court say otherwise, the Huntington-Hill method remains the chosen method for 
apportioning the U.S. House of Representatives.

 68. Consider the problem of apportioning M = 3 seats between 
two states, A and B, using Jefferson’s method. Let pA and 
pB denote the populations of A and B, respectively. Show 
that if the apportionment under Jefferson’s method gives 
all three seats to A and none to B, then more than 75% of 
the country’s population must live in state A. (Hint: Show 
that a Jefferson apportionment of 3 and 0 seats implies that 
pA 7 3pB.)
 69. Consider the problem of apportioning M = 3 seats between 
two states, A and B, using Webster’s method. Let pA and pB 
denote the populations of A and B, respectively. Show that 
if the apportionment under Webster’s method gives all three 
seats to A and none to B, then more than 831
3% of the coun-
try’s population must live in state A. (Hint: Show that a Web-
ster apportionment of 3 and 0 seats implies that pA 7 5pB.)
Lowndes’s Method. Exercises 73 and 74 refer to a variation of 
Hamilton’s method known as Lowndes’s method, first proposed 
in 1822 by South Carolina Representative William Lowndes. The 
basic difference between Hamilton’s and Lowndes’s methods is 
that in Lowndes’s method, after each state is assigned the lower 
quota, the surplus seats are handed out in order of relative frac-
tional parts. (The relative fractional part of a number is the frac-
tional part divided by the integer part. For example, the relative 
fractional part of 41.82 is 0.82
41 = 0.02, and the relative fractional 
part of 3.08 is 0.08
3 = 0.027. Notice that while 41.82 would have 
priority over 3.08 under Hamilton’s method, 3.08 has priority 
over 41.82 under Lowndes’s method because 0.027 is greater 
than 0.02.)
 73. (a)  Find the apportionment of Parador’s Congress (Exam-
ple 3) under Lowndes’s method.
 
(b) Verify that the resulting apportionment is different 
from each of the apportionments found under the other  
methods discussed in the chapter. In particular, list 
which states do better under Lowndes’s method than 
under Hamilton’s method.
 74. Consider an apportionment problem with two states, A and 
B. Suppose that state A has standard quota q1 and state B

has standard quota q2, neither of which is a whole number. 
(Of course, q1 + q2 = M must be a whole number.) Let f1 
represent the fractional part of q1 and f2 the fractional part 
of q2.
 
(a) Find values q1 and q2 such that Lowndes’s method and 
Hamilton’s method result in the same apportionment.
 
(b) Find values q1 and q2 such that Lowndes’s method and 
Hamilton’s method result in different apportionments.
 
(c) Write an inequality involving q1, q2, f1, and f2 that 
would guarantee that Lowndes’ method and Hamil-
ton’s method result in different apportionments.

 75. The Hamilton-Jefferson hybrid method. The Hamilton-
Jefferson hybrid method starts by giving each state its lower 
quota (as per Hamilton’s method) and then apportioning 
the surplus seats using Jefferson’s method.
 
(a) Use the Hamilton-Jefferson hybrid method to appor-
tion M = 22 seats among four states according to the 
following populations: A (population 18,000), B (popu-
lation 18,179), C (population 40,950), and D (popula-
tion 122,871).
 
(b) Explain why the Hamilton-Jefferson hybrid method 
can produce apportionments that are different from 
both Hamilton and Jefferson apportionments.

 1 dean’s method
Dean’s method (also known as the method of harmonic means) was 
first proposed in 1832 by James Dean. [This is a different James 
Dean. Dean (1776–1849) was a Professor of Astronomy and Math-
ematics at Dartmouth College and the University of Vermont.] 
Dean’s method is a divisor method similar to Webster’s method 
but with a slightly different set of rules for rounding the quotas. In 
this project you are to prepare a report on Dean’s method. Your 
report should include (1) a discussion of the harmonic mean, in-
cluding some of its properties and applications; (2) a description 
of Dean’s method; (3) a discussion of how Dean’s method can be 
implemented using trial and error; and (4) a comparison of Dean’s 
method with Webster’s method with an example showing that the 
two methods can produce different apportionments.
 2  apportionment methods and the 2000
  
presidential Election
After tremendous controversy over hanging chads and missed 
votes, the 2000 presidential election was decided in the United 
States Supreme Court, with George W. Bush getting the dis-
puted electoral votes from Florida and thus beating Al Gore by 
a margin of four electoral votes. Ignored in all the controversy 
was the significant role that the choice of apportionment method 
plays in a close presidential election. Would things have turned 
out differently if the House of Representatives had been appor-
tioned under a different method?
In this project, you are asked to analyze and speculate how 
the election would have turned out had the House of Repre-
proJEcts and papErs
sentatives (and thus the Electoral College) been apportioned 
under (1) Hamilton’s method, (2) Jefferson’s method, and (3) 
Webster’s method.
Notes: (1) The 2000 Electoral College was based on the 1990 
U.S. Census. (Remember to add 2 to the seats in the House to 
get each state’s Electoral College votes!) You can go to www
.census.gov/main/www//cen1990.html for the 1990 state popu-
lation figures. (2) You can use the Apportionment applets in 
MyMathLab* to do the calculations.
*MyMathLab code required.
 3  rank index implementations
  
of divisor methods
From a computational point of view, the divisor methods of 
Jefferson, Adams, and Webster can be implemented using a 
priority system (called a rank index) that gives away seats one 
by one according to a table of values specifically constructed for 
this purpose. Each of the methods uses a slightly different set of 
rules to construct the rank index for the seats. In this project you 
are to describe how to construct the rank index for each of the 
three divisor methods studied in this chapter (Jefferson, Adams, 
and Webster). You should use a simple example to illustrate the 
procedure for each method.

The Mathematics of Apportionment
For the first apportionment of 1792, two competing 
apportionment bills were considered: a bill to apportion 120 
seats using Hamilton’s method (sponsored by Hamilton), and a 
bill to apportion 105 seats using Jefferson’s method (sponsored 
by Jefferson). Originally, Congress passed Hamilton’s bill, but 
Washington was persuaded by Jefferson to veto it. Eventually, 
Congress approved Jefferson’s bill, which became the basis for 
the first mathematical apportionment of the House of Repre-
sentatives.
This project has three parts.
part 1. historical research. Summarize the arguments presented 
by Hamilton and Jefferson on behalf of their respective propos-
als. [Suggested sources: The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, Vol. 
XI, Harold C. Syrett (editor), and The Works of Thomas Jeffer-
son, Vol. VI, Paul Leicester Ford (editor)].
part 2. mathematics. Calculate the apportionments for the House 
of Representatives under both proposals.
part 3. analysis. It has been argued by some scholars that there 
was more than mathematical merit behind Jefferson’s think-
ing and Washington’s support of it. Looking at the apportion-
ments obtained in Part 2, explain why one could be suspicious of 
Jefferson and Washington’s motives.
(Hint: Jefferson and Washington were both from the same state.)

dard quota.

lives in state A.
 71. (a)  In Jefferson’s method the modified quotas are larger than the 
standard quotas, so rounding down will give each state at least 
the integer part of the standard quota for that state.
 51. The correct answer is (D). Under Hamilton’s method there can be 
no violations of the quota rule. The only possible apportionment to 
X is 35 or 36.
 53. Upper-quota violations are possible under Jefferson’s method.
 55. The correct answer is (A). The other answers represent lower-quota 
violations, and Jefferson’s method can produce only upper-quota 
violations.

upper-quota violations are possible.

The  
Mathematics of  
Getting Around
Euler Paths and Circuits
United Parcel Service (UPS) is the largest package delivery company in 
the world. On a typical day UPS delivers roughly 15 million packages 
to over 6 million customers worldwide; on a busy day much more 
than that (the week before Christmas 2011, UPS delivered more than 
120 million packages). Such remarkable feats of logistics require 
tremendous resources, superb organization, and (surprise!) a good dose 
of mathematics. In this chapter we will discuss some of the mathematical 
ideas that make this possible.

n a normal day a UPS driver delivers somewhere between 200 and 500 
packages. In rural areas where there may be considerable distances be-
tween delivery points, the number is closer to 200; in highly populated 
urban areas where the delivery points are close to each other the number is closer to 
500. But in both cases one of the keys to success in delivering all the packages is the 
efficiency of the delivery route. Efficient routing means, among other things, keep-
ing deadheading (the term used to describe driving over the same section of road 
more than once) at a minimum, and this is where the mathematics comes in: How do 
you design a route that minimizes the total amount of “wasted” travel?
Problems like those faced by a UPS driver (or a FedEx driver, or a mail carrier for 
that matter) trying to minimize the total length of his or her route are known as street-
routing problems, and they have applications to other types of situations such as rout-
ing garbage trucks, security patrols, tourist buses, and even late-night pizza deliveries.
Section 1 introduces the concept of a street-routing problem and shows ex-
amples in several different settings and applications. Keep in mind that many 
of the examples in this section are scaled down in size and scope to keep things  
simple—in real life the same application will occur on a much larger scale. Regardless 
of the scale, the mathematical theory behind street-routing problems is one and the 
same, and we owe much of this theory to the genius of one man—the Swiss mathema-
tician Leonhard Euler. Euler’s role was so significant that in this chapter we will see 
his last name (pronounced “oiler,” by the way) 
used both as a noun (Euler circuit, Euler path) 
and as a verb (eulerizing, semi-eulerizing). Sec-
tion 2 introduces graphs—the key mathemati-
cal tool that allows us to tackle street-routing 
problems— and some of the concepts and 
terminology associated with graphs. Section 3 
gives the mathematical infrastructure needed 
to solve street-routing problems, consisting 
of three key facts (Euler’s Circuit Theorem, 
Euler’s Path Theorem, and the Sum of Degrees 
Theorem) and an algorithm known as Fleury’s 
Algorithm. In Section 4 we will learn how to 
combine all the preceding ideas to develop the 
strategies needed to solve street-routing prob-
lems in general.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
We will start this section with a brief discussion of routing problems. What is a 
routing problem? To put it in the most general way, routing problems are con-
cerned with finding ways to route the delivery of goods and/or services to an as-
sortment of destinations. The goods or services in question could be packages, 
mail, newspapers, pizzas, garbage collection, bus service, and so on. The delivery 
destinations could be homes, warehouses, distribution centers, terminals, and the 
like.
There are two basic questions that we are typically interested in when deal-
ing with a routing problem. The first is called the existence question. The exis-
tence question is simple: Is an actual route possible? For most routing problems, 
the existence question is easy to answer, and the answer takes the form of a 
simple yes or no. When the answer to the existence question is yes, then a sec-
ond question—the optimization question—comes into play. Of all the possible 
routes, which one is the optimal route? (Optimal here means “the best” when 
measured against some predetermined variable such as cost, distance, or time.) 
In most management science problems, the optimization question is where the 
action is.
In this chapter we will learn how to answer both the existence and optimiza-
tion questions for a special class of routing problems known as street-routing 
problems. The common thread in all street-routing problems is what we might 
call, for lack of a better term, the pass-through requirement—the requirement 
that the route must pass at least once through some specified set of connections. 
In other words, in a street-routing problem the pass-through requirement means 
that each street (or bridge, or lane, or highway) within a defined area (be it a 
town, an area of town, or a subdivision) must be covered by the route. We will 
refer to these types of routes as exhaustive routes. The most common services 
that typically require exhaustive routing are mail delivery, police patrols, gar-
bage collection, street sweeping, and snow removal. More exotic examples can 
be census taking, precinct walking, electric meter reading, routing parades, tour 
buses, and so on.
To clarify some of the ideas we will introduce several examples of street-routing  
problems (just the problems for now—their solutions will come later in the  
chapter).
Street-Routing Problems

ExamplE 1  ThE SEcuriTy Guard problEm
After a rash of burglaries, a private security guard is hired to patrol the streets of 
the Sunnyside neighborhood shown in Fig. 1. The security guard’s assignment is to 
make an exhaustive patrol, on foot, through the entire neighborhood. Obviously, 
he doesn’t want to walk any more than what is necessary. His starting point is the 
corner of Elm and J streets across from the school (S in Fig. 1)—that’s where he usu-
ally parks his car. (This is relevant because at the end of his patrol he needs to come 
back to S to pick up his car.) Being a practical person, the security guard would like 
the answers to the following questions:
1.  Is it possible to start and end at S, cover every block of the neighborhood, and 
pass through each block just once?
2.  If some of the blocks will have to be covered more than once, what is an optimal 
route that covers the entire neighborhood? (“Optimal” here means “with the 
minimal amount of walking.”)
3.  Can a better route (i.e., less walking) be found by choosing a different starting 
and ending point? We will answer all of these questions in Section 4.

ExamplE 2  ThE mail carriEr problEm
A mail carrier has to deliver mail in the same Sunnyside neighborhood (Fig. 1). The 
difference between the mail carrier’s route and the security guard’s route is that the 
mail carrier must make two passes through blocks with buildings on both sides of the 
street and only one pass through blocks with buildings on only one side of the street 
(and where there are no buildings on either side of the street, the mail carrier does 
not have to walk at all). In addition, the mail carrier has no choice as to her starting 
and ending points—she has to start and end her route at the local post office (P in 
Fig. 1). Much like the security guard, the mail carrier wants to find the optimal route 
that would allow her to cover the neighborhood with the least amount of walking. 
(Put yourself in her shoes and you would do the same—good weather or bad, she 
walks this route 300 days a year!)
ExamplE 3  ThE upS drivEr problEm
Now we consider the case of a UPS driver who must deliver packages around the 
Sunnyside neighborhood. The red crosses in Fig. 2 indicate the locations (homes or 
businesses) where packages are to be delivered (it’s the week before Christmas so 
there is an unusually large number of packages to be delivered).
Unlike the mail carrier (required to pass through every block of the neighbor-
hood where there are homes or businesses), the UPS driver has to pass only through 
those blocks where there are red crosses, and only once through such blocks (if the 
delivery is on the opposite side of the street he just crosses the street on foot). In 
addition, because of other deliveries, the UPS driver must enter the neighborhood 
through the street indicated by the “in” arrow and exit the neighborhood through 
the street indicated by the “out” arrow. Once again, we want to determine (and we 
will in Section 4) the most efficient route that will allow the UPS driver to deliver all 
those packages. The requirements for the route are (a) enter and exit the neighbor-
hood where indicated in Fig. 2 and (b) pass through every block where there are

delivery locations marked with red crosses. [Note: In general, UPS drivers are most-
ly concerned with the total time it takes to complete their package deliveries rather 
than the total distance traveled, and often go out of their way to avoid left-turn 
signals or streets with a lot of traffic. This makes the routing problem more compli-
cated; therefore, to keep things simple we will assume that in this example driving 
time is proportional to distance traveled (this happens, for example, when there is 
little or no traffic or when traffic moves evenly throughout the neighborhood). Un-
der this assumption the most efficient route is still the shortest route.]
Our next example is primarily of historical interest. Euler was introduced to 
the Königsberg bridges puzzle in the early 1700s as a recreational puzzle that might 
potentially be solved using mathematical ideas, but nobody was clear as to what 
kind of mathematics was needed. Euler’s great contribution was in developing a 
new mathematical theory (now known as graph theory) that could be used to solve 
the bridges puzzle as well as much more practical and complex problems. We will be 
introduced to Euler’s ideas in the next three sections.

ExamplE 4  ThE KöniGSbErG bridGES puzzlE
This story starts in the 1700s in the medieval town of Königsberg, in Eastern  
Europe. A map of the city at that time is shown in Fig. 3, with the river Pregel run-
ning through town, the two islands on the river, and the north and south banks all 
connected by the seven bridges shown in red. (Note: Present-day Königsberg has 
a different layout, as two of the bridges no longer exist.) A little game played by 
the locals at the time was to try to take a walk around town fully crossing every 
bridge once and only once (i.e., no bridge could be skipped and no bridge could 
be crossed twice). Nobody was able to do this successfully and a widely held belief 
in the town was that such a walk was indeed impossible. What was asked of Euler 
was to rigorously prove this. He did this, and much more. We will soon learn how 
he did it.

If we think of the bridges as playing a role analogous to that of the streets in the 
Sunnyside neighborhood, the Königsberg bridges puzzle becomes another street-
routing problem. The negative answer to the puzzle means that no route that satis-
fies the restrictions of the problem (pass through each bridge once and only once) 
exists.
Our next example is an expanded and modernized version of the Königsberg 
bridges problem.

Madison County is a quaint old place, famous for its beautiful bridges. The Madison 
River runs through the county, and there are four islands (A, B, C, and D) and 11 bridges 
joining the islands to both banks of the river (R and L) and one another (Fig. 4). 
A famous photographer is hired to take pictures of each of the 11 bridges for a  
national magazine. The photographer needs to drive across each bridge once for the 
photo shoot. The problem is that there is a $25 toll (the locals call it a “maintenance 
tax”) every time an out-of-town visitor drives across a bridge, and the photogra-
pher wants to minimize the total cost of the trip. The street-routing problem here 
is to find a route that passes through each bridge at least once and recrosses as few 
bridges as possible. Moreover, the photographer can start the route on either bank 
of the river and, likewise, end it on either bank of the river.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
The key tool we will use to tackle the street-routing problems introduced in Section 
1 is the notion of a graph. The most common way to describe a graph is by means of 
a picture. The basic elements of such a picture are a set of “dots” called the vertices 
of the graph and a collection of “lines” called the edges of the graph. (Unfortunate-
ly, this terminology is not universal. In some applications the word “nodes” is used 
for the vertices and the word “links” is used for the edges. We will stick to vertices 
and edges as much as possible.) On the surface, that’s all there is to it—edges con-
necting vertices. Below the surface there is a surprisingly rich theory. Let’s look at 
a few examples first.
ExamplE 6  baSic Graph concEpTS
Figure 5 shows several examples of graphs. We will discuss each separately.
n Figure 5(a) shows a graph with six vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F (it is cus-
tomary to use capital letters to label the vertices of a graph). For convenience we 
refer to the set of vertices of a graph as the vertex set. In this graph, the vertex set 
is 5A, B, C, D, E, F6. The graph has 11 edges (described by listing, in any order, 
the two vertices that are connected by the edge): AB, AD, BC, etc.
 When two vertices are connected by an edge we say that they are adjacent 
vertices. Thus, A and B are adjacent vertices, but A and E are not adjacent. 
The edge connecting B with itself is written as BB and is called a loop. Ver-
tices C and D are connected twice (i.e., by two separate edges), so when we 
list the edges we include CD twice. Similarly, vertices E and F are connected 
by three edges, so we list EF three times. We refer to edges that appear more 
than once as multiple edges.
 The complete list of edges of the graph, the edge list, is AB, AD, BB, BC, BE, 
CD, CD, DE, EF, EF, EF.
 The number of edges that meet at each vertex is called the degree of the 
vertex and is denoted by deg1X2. In this graph we have deg1A2 = 2, 
deg1B2 = 5 (please note that the loop contributes 2 to the degree of the 
vertex), deg1C2 = 3, deg1D2 = 4, deg1E2 = 5, and deg1F2 = 3. It will be 
important in the next section to distinguish between vertices depending on 
whether their degree is an odd or an even number. We will refer to vertices 
like B, C, E, and F with an odd degree as odd vertices and to vertices with an 
even degree like A and D as even vertices.
n Figure 5(b) is very similar to Fig. 5(a)—the only difference is the way the edge 
BE is drawn. In Fig. 5(a) edges AD and BE cross each other, but the crossing

point is not a vertex of the graph—it’s just an irrelevant crossing point. Fig. 5(b) 
gets around the crossing by drawing the edge in a more convoluted way, but the 
way we draw an edge is itself irrelevant. The key point here is that as graphs, 
Figs. 5(a) and 5(b) are the same. Both have exactly the same vertices and exactly 
the same edge list.
n Figure 5(c) take the idea one step further—it is in fact, another rendering of the 
graph shown in Figs. 5(a) and (b). The vertices have been moved around and 
put in different positions, and the edges are funky—no other way to describe 
it. Despite all the funkiness, this graph conveys exactly the same information 
that the graph in Fig. 5(a) does. You can check it out— same set of vertices and 
same edge list. The moral here is that while graphs are indeed pictures connect-
ing “dots” with “lines,” it is not the specific picture that matters but the story 
that the picture tells: which dots are connected to each other and which aren’t. 
We can move the vertices around, and we can draw the edges any funky way we 
want (straight line, curved line, wavy line, etc.)—none of that matters. The only 
thing that matters is the set of vertices and the list of edges.
n Figure 5(d) shows a graph with six vertices. Vertices A, B, C, D, and E form what 
is known as a clique—each vertex is connected to each of the other four. Ver-
tex F, on the other hand, is connected to only one other vertex. This graph has 
no loops or multiple edges. Graphs without loops or multiple edges are called 
simple graphs. There are many applications of graphs where loops and multiple 
edges cannot occur, and we have to deal only with simple graphs. (In Examples 
7 and 8 we will see two applications where only simple graphs occur.)
n Figure 5(e) shows a graph very similar to the one in Fig. 5(d). The only differ-
ence between the two is the absence of the edge EF. In this graph there are 
no edges connecting F to any other vertex. For obvious reasons, F is called an 
isolated vertex. This graph is made up of two separate and disconnected “piec-
es”—the clique formed by the vertices A, B, C, D, and E and the isolated vertex 
F. Because the graph is not made of a single “piece,” we say that the graph is 
disconnected, and the separate pieces that make up the graph are called the 
components of the graph.
n Figure 5(f) shows a connected simple graph. The vertices of this graph are 
names (there is no rule about what the labels of a vertex can be). Can you guess 
what this graph might possibly represent?
FiGurE 5 (a), (b), and (c) are all pictures of the same graph; (d) is a simple, connected graph; 
(e) is a simple, disconnected graph; and (f) is a graph labeled with names instead of letters.

ExamplE 8  ThE FacEbooK Social Graph
Do you know who your friends’ friends are? In the off-line world—where friend-
ships are tight and relationships are personal—you probably have some idea. In 
the Facebook world—where “friendships” are cheap—you probably have a fairly 
limited picture of the complex web of friend-
ships that connect your own set of Facebook 
friends.
But worry no more. Thanks to the Face-
book Social Graph (FSG), you can have 
a complete picture of how your Facebook 
friends are connected. The FSG is a Face-
book app available for free to anyone on 
Facebook. [To create your own FSG (and 
you are strongly encouraged to do it now, 
not just for the curiosity factor but because 
it will help you navigate this example) go to 
your Facebook account, click on “Apps and 
Games,” find “Social Graph” (you may have 
to do a search for it) and click “Allow.”]
The vertices of the FSG are all your 
Facebook friends. You are not included be-
cause it is understood that you are a friend 
of everyone on the graph. An edge con-
necting two of your friends means that they 
are friends. Fig. 7 shows the FSG of a real 
person (who will remain nameless), but the 
FSG is at its most useful when used in a dy-
namic way. When you run the mouse over a 
particular friend X, the app will highlight all 
the connections between X and your other 
friends. Some X’s are “hubs” connected to many people (if you are married it is very 
likely that your spouse is a hub, since you typically share most of your friends); other X’s 
might be isolated vertices (the guy sitting next to you on the airplane with whom you 
ExamplE 7  airlinE rouTE mapS
Figure 6 shows the route map for a very small airline 
called Air Rarotonga. Air Rarotonga serves just 10 is-
lands in the South Pacific, and the route map shows 
the direct flights that are available between the vari-
ous islands. In essence, the route map is a graph whose 
vertices are the islands. An edge connects two islands 
if there is a direct flight between them. No direct flight, 
no edge. The picture makes a slight attempt to respect 
geographical facts (the bigger islands are drawn larg-
er but certainly not to scale, and they sit in the ocean 
more or less as shown), but the point of an airline route 
map is to show if there is a direct flight from point X to 
point Y, and, in that regard, accurate geography is not 
all that important.

exchanged pleasantries and ended up being a Facebook friend). The FSG also high-
lights “clusters” of friendships. These clusters represent groups of individuals who 
are all friends with each other (your high school buddies perhaps, or coworkers, or 
family).
The main point of Examples 7 and 8 is to highlight how powerful (and useful) the 
concept of a graph can be. Granted, the Air Rarotonga route map is small (just right 
to illustrate the point), but if you think big you can imagine a United Airlines route 
map instead, with hundreds of destinations and thousands of flights connecting them. 
The fundamental idea is still the same—graphs convey visually a tremendous amount 
of information that would be hard to convey in any other form. Can you imagine 
describing the complex web of relationships in your Facebook Social Graph or in a 
United Airlines route map any other way? Airline route maps and friendship graphs 
are always simple graphs, without loops (airlines don’t routinely schedule flights that 
go around in circles, and by definition, friendship is a connection between two differ-
ent persons) or multiple edges (either there are direct flights connecting X and Y or 
there aren’t, and X and Y are either friends or they aren’t).
ExamplE 9  paThS and circuiTS
We say that two edges are adjacent edges when they share a common vertex. In 
Fig. 8 for example, AB is adjacent to AC and AD (they share vertex A), as well as to 
BC, BF, and BE (they share vertex B). A sequence of distinct edges each adjacent to 
the next is called a path, and the number of edges in the path is called the length of the 
path. For example in Fig. 8, the edges AB, BF, and FG form a path of length 3. A good 
way to think of a path is as a real-world path—a way to “hike” along the edges of the 
graph, traveling along the first edge, then the next, and so on. To shorten the notation, 
we describe the path by just listing the vertices in sequence separated by commas. For 
example A, B, F, G describes the path formed by the edges AB, BF, and FG.
Here are a few more examples of paths in Fig. 8:
n A, B is a path of length 1. Any edge can be thought of as a path of length 1—not very 
interesting, but it allows us to apply the concept of a path even to single edges.
n A, B, C, A, D, E is a path of length 5 starting at A and ending at E. The path goes 
through vertex A a second time, but that’s OK. It is permissible for a path to revisit 
some of the vertices. On the other hand, A, C, B, A, C does not meet the definition of 
a path because the edges of the path cannot be revisited and here AC is traveled twice. 
So, in a path it’s OK to revisit some of the vertices but not OK to revisit any edges.
n A, B, C, A, D, E, E, B is a path of length 7. Notice that this “trip” is possible 
because of the loop at E.
n A, B, C, A, D, E, B, C is also a legal path of length 7. Here we can use the edge 
BC twice because there are in fact two distinct edges connecting B and C.
When a trip along the edges of the graph closes back on itself (i.e., starts and 
ends with the same vertex) we specifically call it a circuit rather than a path. Thus, 
we will restrict the term path to open-ended trips and the word circuit to closed trips.
Here are a few examples of circuits in Fig. 8:
n A, D, E, B, A is a circuit of length 4. Even though it appears like the circuit des-
ignates A as the starting (and ending) vertex, a circuit is independent of where 
we designate the start. In other words, the same circuit can be written as D, E, B, 
A, D or E, B, A, D, E, etc. They are all the same circuit, but we have to choose 
one (arbitrary) vertex to start the list.
n B, C, B is a circuit of length 2. This is possible because of the double edge BC. 
On the other hand, B, A, B is not a circuit because the edge AB is being traveled 
twice. (Just as in a path, the edges of a circuit have to be distinct.)
n E, E is a circuit of length 1. A loop is the only way to have a circuit of length 1.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
In Example 9 we saw several examples of paths (and circuits) that are part of the 
graph in Fig. 8, but the important idea we will discuss next in this: Can the path (or 
circuit) be the entire graph, not just a part of it? In other words, we want to consider 
the possibility of a path (or a circuit) that exhausts all the edges of the graph.
An Euler path (named after Leonhard Euler) is a path that covers all the edges 
of the graph. Likewise, an Euler circuit is a circuit that covers all the edges of the 
graph. In other words, we have an Euler path (or circuit) when the entire graph can 
be written as a path (or circuit).

Figure 12 shows three different graphs. The graph in Fig. 12(a) is connected; 
the graph in Fig. 12(b) is disconnected and has two components; the graph in  
Fig. 12(c) is disconnected and has three components (the isolated vertex G is a com-
ponent—that’s as small a component as you can get!).
ExamplE 10  EulEr paThS and EulEr circuiTS
Figures 9, 10, and 11 illustrate the three possibilities that can occur:
n  The graph in Fig. 9(a) has an Euler path—in fact, it has several. One of the pos-
sible Euler paths is shown in Fig. 9(b). The path starts at C and ends at D—just 
follow the arrows and you will be able to “trace” the edges of the graph without 
retracing any (just like in elementary school).
n  The graph in Fig. 10(a) has many possible Euler circuits. One of them is shown 
in Fig. 10(b). Just follow the arrows. Unlike the Euler path in Fig. 9(b), the arrows 
are not numbered. You can start this circuit at any vertex of the graph, follow the 
arrows, and you will return to the starting vertex having covered all the edges once.
n The graph in Fig. 11 has neither an Euler path nor an Euler circuit. That’s the 
way it goes sometimes—some graphs just don’t have it!
We introduced the idea of a connected or disconnected graph in Example 6. For-
mally, we say that a graph is connected if you can get from any vertex to any other 
vertex along some path of the graph. Informally, this says that you can get from any 
point to any other point by “hiking” along the edges of the graph. Even more infor-
mally, it means that the graph is made of one “piece.” A graph that is not connected 
is called disconnected and consists of at least two (maybe more) separate “pieces” 
we call the components of the graph.

Notice that the only difference between the disconnected graph in Fig. 12(b) 
and the connected graph in Fig. 12(a) is the edge BF. Think of BF as a “bridge” 
that connects the two components of the graph in Fig. 12(b). Not surprisingly, we 
call such an edge a bridge. A bridge in a connected graph is an edge that keeps the 
graph connected—if the bridge were not there, the graph would be disconnected. 
The graph in Fig. 12(a) has three bridges: BF, FG, and FH.

cepts we have seen so far.

Graphs as models
One of Euler’s most important insights was that certain types of problems can be con-
veniently rephrased as graph problems and that, in fact, graphs are just the right tool for 
describing many real-life situations. The notion of using a mathematical concept to de-
scribe and solve a real-life problem is one of the oldest and grandest traditions in math-
ematics. It is called modeling. Unwittingly, we have all done simple forms of modeling 
before, all the way back to elementary school. Every time we turn a word problem into 
an arithmetic calculation, an algebraic equation, or a geometric picture, we are model-
ing. We can now add to our repertoire one more tool for modeling: graph models.
In the next set of examples we are going to illustrate how we can use graphs to 
model some of the street-routing problems introduced in Section 1.
ExamplE 12  modElinG ThE bridGES oF KöniGSbErG puzzlE
The Königsberg bridges puzzle introduced in Example 4 asked whether it was possible 
to take a stroll through the old city of Königsberg and cross each of the seven bridges 
once and only once. Figure 13 shows the evolution of a graph model that we can use 
to answer this question. Figure 13(a) shows the original map of the city in the 1700s.  
Figure 13(b) is a “leaner” version of the map, with lots of obviously irrelevant details  
removed. A little further reflection should convince us that many details in Fig.  
13(b) are still irrelevant to the question. The shape and size of the islands, the width of 
the river, the lengths of the bridges—none of these things really matter. So, then, what 
does matter? Surprisingly little. The only thing that truly matters to the solution of this 
problem is the relationship between land masses (islands and banks) and bridges. Which 
land masses are connected to each other and by how many bridges? This information is 
captured by the red edges in Fig. 13(c). Thus, when we strip the map of all its superfluous 
information, we end up with the graph model shown in Fig. 13(d). The four vertices of 
the graph represent each of the four land masses; the edges represent the seven bridges. 
In this graph an Euler circuit would represent a stroll around the town that crosses each 
bridge once and ends back at the starting point; an Euler path would represent a stroll 
that crosses each bridge once but does not return to the starting point.

As big moments go this one may not seem like much, but Euler’s idea to turn a 
puzzle about walking across bridges in a quaint medieval city into an abstract ques-
tion about graphs was a “eureka” moment in the history of mathematics. 
ExamplE 15  modElinG ThE upS drivEr problEm
In Example 3 we discussed the UPS driver street-routing problem. The circum-
stances for the UPS driver are slightly different than those of the mail carrier. First, 
the UPS driver has to cover only those blocks where he has packages to deliver, 
shown by the red crosses in Fig. 15(a). Second, because of other deliveries outside 
the neighborhood, his route requires that he enter and exit the neighborhood at op-
posite ends, as shown in Fig. 15(a). Third, the driver can deliver packages on both 
sides of the street in a single pass. Taking all of these factors into account, we use the 
graph in Fig. 15(b) as a model for the UPS driver problem, with the required starting 
and ending points of the route shown in red.
ExamplE 14  modElinG ThE mail carriEr problEm
Unlike the security guard, the mail carrier in Example 2 must make two passes 
through every block that has homes on both sides of the street (she has to physi-
cally place the mail in the mailboxes), must make one pass through blocks that have 
homes on only one side of the street, and does not have to walk along blocks where 
there are no houses. In this situation an appropriate graph model requires two edges 
on the blocks that have homes on both sides of the street, one edge for the blocks 
that have homes on only one side of the street, and no edges for blocks having no 
homes on either side of the street. The graph that models this situation is shown in 
Fig. 14(c).

In Example 1 we were introduced to the problem of the security guard who needs 
to walk the streets of the Sunnyside neighborhood [Fig. 14(a)]. The graph in Fig. 
14(b)—where each edge represents a block of the neighborhood and each vertex an 
intersection—is a graph model of this problem. The questions raised in Example 1 
can now be formulated in the language of graphs.
 1. Does the graph in Fig. 14(b) have an Euler circuit that starts and ends at S?
 2. What is the fewest number of edges that have to be added to the graph so that 
there is an Euler circuit?
We will learn how to answer such questions in the next couple of sections.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
In this section we are going to develop the basic theory that will allow us to deter-
mine if a graph has an Euler circuit, an Euler path, or neither. This is important 
because, as we saw in the previous section, what are Euler circuit or Euler path 
questions in theory are real-life street-routing questions in practice. The three theo-
rems we are going to see next (all due to Euler) are surprisingly simple and yet tre-
mendously useful.

n If a graph is connected and every vertex is even, then it has an Euler circuit 
(at least one, usually more).
n If a graph has any odd vertices, then it does not have an Euler circuit.
EulEr’S circuiT ThEorEm
If we want to know if a graph has an Euler circuit or not, here is how we can use 
Euler’s circuit theorem. First we make sure the graph is connected. (If it isn’t, then 
no matter what else, an Euler circuit is impossible.) If the graph is connected, then 
we start checking the degrees of the vertices, one by one. As soon as we hit an odd 
vertex, we know that an Euler circuit is out of the question. If there are no odd verti-
ces, then we know that the answer is yes—the graph does have an Euler circuit! (The 
theorem doesn’t tell us how to find it—that will come soon.) Figure 16 illustrates the 
three possible scenarios. The graph in Fig. 16(a) cannot have an Euler circuit for the 
simple reason that it is disconnected. The graph in Fig. 16(b) is connected, but we 
can quickly spot odd vertices (C is one of them; there are others). This graph has no 
Euler circuits either. But the graph in Fig. 16(c) is connected and all the vertices are 
even. This graph does have Euler circuits.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
The basic idea behind Euler’s circuit theorem is that as we travel along an Euler 
circuit, every time we go through a vertex we use up two different edges at that vertex— 
one to come in and one to go out. We can keep doing this as long as the vertices are 
even. A single odd vertex means that at some point we are going to come into it and 
not be able to get out. An analogous theorem will work with Euler paths, but now 
we do need odd vertices for the starting and ending points of the path. All the other 
vertices have to be even. Thus, we have the following theorem.
n The sum of the degrees of all the vertices of a graph equals twice the num-
ber of edges (and, therefore, is an even number).
n A graph always has an even number of odd vertices.
EulEr’S Sum oF dEGrEES ThEorEm
n If a graph is connected and has exactly two odd vertices, then it has an Euler 
path (at least one, usually more). Any such path must start at one of the odd 
vertices and end at the other one.
n If a graph has more than two odd vertices, then it cannot have an Euler 
path.
EulEr’S paTh ThEorEm
Euler’s circuit theorem deals with graphs with zero odd vertices, whereas Euler’s  
path theorem deals with graphs with two or more odd vertices. The only scenario 
not covered by the two theorems is that of graphs with just one odd vertex. Euler’s 
third theorem rules out this possibility—a graph cannot have just one odd vertex. In 
fact, Euler’s third theorem says much more.
ExamplE 16  ThE bridGES oF KöniGSbErG puzzlE SolvEd
Back to the Königsberg bridges problem. In Example 12 we saw that the layout of 
the bridges in the old city can be modeled by the graph in Fig. 17(a). This graph has 
four odd vertices; thus, neither an Euler circuit nor an Euler path can exist. We now 
have an unequivocal answer to the puzzle: There is no possible way anyone can walk 
across all the bridges without having to recross some of them! How many bridges will 
need to be recrossed? It depends. If we want to start and end in the same place, we 
must recross at least two of the bridges. One of the many possible routes is shown in 
Fig. 17(b). In this route the bridge connecting L and D is crossed twice, and so is one 
of the two bridges connecting A and R. If we are allowed to start and end in different 
places, we can do it by recrossing just one of the bridges. One possible route starting 
at A, crossing bridge LD twice, and ending at R is shown in Fig. 17(c).

Euler’s sum of degrees theorem is based on the following basic observation: 
Take any edge—let’s call it XY. The edge contributes once to the degree of vertex 
X and once to the degree of vertex Y, so, in all, that edge makes a total contribution 
167

The Mathematics of Getting Around
of 2 to the sum of the degrees. Thus, when the degrees of all the vertices of a graph 
are added, the total is twice the number of edges. Since the total sum is an even num-
ber, it is impossible to have just one odd vertex, or three 
odd vertices, or five odd vertices, and so on. To put it in 
a slightly different way, the odd vertices of a graph always 
come in twos.
Table 2 is a summary of Euler’s three theorems. 
It shows the relationship between the number of odd 
vertices in a connected graph G and the existence of 
Euler paths or Euler circuits. (The assumption that G 
is connected is essential—a disconnected graph cannot 
have Euler paths or circuits regardless of what else is 
going on.)
Euler’s theorems help us answer the following existence question: Does the 
graph have an Euler circuit, an Euler path, or neither? But when the graph has an 
Euler circuit or path, how do we find it? For small graphs, simple trial-and-error 
usually works fine, but real-life applications sometimes involve graphs with hun-
dreds, or even thousands, of vertices. In these cases a trial-and-error approach is out 
of the question, and what is needed is a systematic strategy that tells us how to create 
an Euler circuit or path. In other words, we need an algorithm.
Fleury’s algorithm
There are many types of problems that can be solved by simply following a set of 
procedural rules—very specific rules like when you get to this point, do this, . . . 
after you finish this, do that, and so on. Given a specific problem X, an algorithm 
for solving X is a set of procedural rules that, when followed, always lead to some 
sort of “solution” to X. X need not be a mathematics problem—algorithms are 
used, sometimes unwittingly, in all walks of life: directions to find someone’s 
house, the instructions for assembling a new bike, and a recipe for baking an 
apple pie are all examples of real-life algorithms. A useful analogy is to think 
of the problem as a dish we want to prepare and the algorithm as a recipe for 
preparing that dish.
In many cases, there are several different algorithms for solving the same 
problem (there is more than one way to bake an apple pie); in other cases, 
the problem does not lend itself to an algorithmic solution. In mathematics, 
algorithms are either formula driven (you just apply the formula or formulas 
to the appropriate inputs) or directive driven (you must follow a specific set of 
directives). 
Algorithms may be complicated but are rarely difficult. (There is a world of 
difference between complicated and difficult—accounting is complicated, calcu-
lus is difficult!) You don’t have to be a brilliant and creative thinker to imple-
ment most algorithms—you just have to learn how to follow instructions care-
fully and methodically. For most of the algorithms we will discuss in this chapter, 
the key to success is simple: practice, practice, and more practice!
We will now turn our attention to an algorithm that finds an Euler circuit or 
an Euler path in a connected graph. Technically speaking, these are two separate 
algorithms, but in essence they are identical, so they can be described as one. 
(The algorithm we will give here is attributed to a Frenchman by the name of 
M. Fleury, who is alleged to have published a description of the algorithm in 
1885. Other than his connection to this algorithm, little else is known about 
Monsieur Fleury.)
The idea behind Fleury’s algorithm can be paraphrased by that old piece of folk 
wisdom: Don’t burn your bridges behind you. In graph theory the word bridge has 
a very specific meaning—it is the only edge connecting two separate sections (call

them A and B) of a graph, as illustrated in Fig. 18. This means that 
if you are in A, you can only get to B by crossing the bridge. If you 
do that and then want to get back to A, you will need to recross that 
same bridge. It follows that if you don’t want to recross bridges, you 
better finish your business at A before you move on to B.
Thus, Fleury’s algorithm is based on a simple principle: To find 
an Euler circuit or an Euler path, bridges are the last edges you want 
to cross. Only do it if you have no choice! Simple enough, but there 
is a rub: The graph whose bridges we are supposed to avoid is not 
necessarily the original graph of the problem. Instead, it is that part 
of the original graph that has yet to be traveled. The point is this: 
Once we travel along an edge, we are done with it! We will never 
cross it again, so from that point on, as far as we are concerned, it is 
as if that edge never existed. Our only concern is how we are going 
to get around in the yet-to-be-traveled part of the graph. Thus, when we talk about 
bridges that we want to leave as a last resort, we are really referring to bridges of the 
to-be-traveled part of the graph.

algorithm, see Exercise 75.

ExamplE 17  implEmEnTinG FlEury’S alGoriThm
The graph in Fig. 19(a) is a very simple graph—it would be easier to find an Euler 
circuit just by trial-and-error than by using Fleury’s algorithm. Nonetheless, we 
will do it using Fleury’s algorithm. The real purpose of the example is to see the al-
gorithm at work. Each step of the algorithm is explained in Figs. 19(b) through (h).
*MyMathLab code required.
n Preliminaries. Make sure that the graph is connected and either (1) has no 
odd vertices (circuit) or (2) has just two odd vertices (path).
n Start. Choose a starting vertex. [In case (1) this can be any vertex; in case 
(2) it must be one of the two odd vertices.]
n Intermediate steps. At each step, if you have a choice, don’t choose a bridge 
of the yet-to-be-traveled part of the graph. However, if you have only one 
choice, take it.
n End. When you can’t travel any more, the circuit (path) is complete. [In 
case (1) you will be back at the starting vertex; in case (2) you will end at 
the other odd vertex.]
FlEury’S alGoriThm For FindinG an EulEr circuiT (paTh)
The only complicated aspect of Fleury’s algorithm is the bookkeeping. With 
each new step, the untraveled part of the graph changes and there may be new 
bridges formed. Thus, in implementing Fleury’s algorithm it is critical to separate 
the past (the part of the graph that has already been traveled) from the future (the 
part of the graph that still needs to be traveled). While there are many different 
ways to accomplish this (you are certainly encouraged to come up with one of your 
own), a fairly reliable way goes like this: Start with two copies of the graph. Copy 1 
is to keep track of the “future”; copy 2 is to keep track of the “past.” Every time you 
travel along an edge, erase the edge from copy 1, but mark it (say in red) and label it 
with the appropriate number on copy 2. As you move forward, copy 1 gets smaller 
and copy 2 gets redder. At the end, copy 1 has disappeared; copy 2 shows the actual 
Euler circuit or path.
It’s time to look at a couple of examples.
n  
The applet Euler Paths and Euler 
Circuits in the Applets section of 
MyMathLab allows you to practice 
Fleury’s algorithm using this  
approach.*

We will apply Fleury’s algorithm to the graph in Figure 20. Since it would be a little

The Mathematics of Getting Around
In this section we will finally answer some of the street-routing problems introduced 
in Section 1. The common thread in all these problems is to find routes that 
(1) cover all the edges of the graph that models the original problem and (2) 
recross the fewest number of edges. The first requirement typically comes with 
the problem; the second requirement comes from the desire to be as efficient 
as possible. In many applications, each edge represents a unit of cost. The 
more edges along the route, the higher the cost of the route. In a street-routing 
problem the first pass along an edge is a requirement of the job. Any additional 
pass along that edge represents a wasted expense (these extra passes are often 
described as deadhead travel). Thus, an optimal route is one with the fewest 
number of deadhead edges. (This is only true under the assumption that each 
edge equals one unit of cost.)
We are now going to see how the theory developed in the preceding sections 
will help us design optimal street routes for graphs with many (more than two) odd 
vertices. The key idea is that we can turn odd vertices into even vertices by adding 
“duplicate” edges in strategic places.

Our first step is to identify the odd vertices in the graph model. This graph 
has eight odd vertices (B, C, E, F, H, I, K, and L), shown in red. When we add a 
duplicate copy of edges BC, EF, HI, and KL, we get the graph in Fig. 23(b). This is 
called an eulerization of the original graph—in this eulerized version the vertices 
are all even, so we know this graph has an Euler circuit. Moreover, with eight odd 
vertices we need to add at least four duplicate edges, so this is the best we can do.
Figure 23(c) shows one of the many possible Euler circuits, with the edges 
numbered in the order they are traveled. The Euler circuit described in Fig. 23(c) 
represents a route that covers every block of the 3-by-3 street grid and ends back 
at the starting point, using only four deadhead blocks [Fig. 23(d)]. The total length 
of this route is 28 blocks (24 blocks in the grid plus 4 deadhead blocks), and this 
route is optimal—no matter how clever you are or how hard you try, if you want 
to travel along each block of the grid and start and end at the same point, you will 
have to pass through a minimum of 28 blocks! (There are many other ways to do 
it using just 28 blocks, but none with fewer than 28.)

ExamplE 21  ThE SEcuriTy Guard problEm SolvEd
We are now ready to solve the security guard street-routing problem intro-
duced in Example 1 and subsequently modeled in Example 13. Let’s recap the 
story: The security guard is required to walk each block of the Sunnyside neigh-
borhood at least once and he wants to deadhead as few blocks as possible. He 
usually parks his car at S (there is a donut shop on that corner) and needs to 
end his route back at the car. Figure 25 shows the evolution of a solution: Fig.  
25(a) shows the original neighborhood that the security guard must cover; Fig. 
25(b) shows the graph model of the problem (with the 18 odd vertices of the 
graph highlighted in red); Fig. 25(c) shows an eulerization of the graph in (b), 
with the 9 duplicate edges shown in red. This is the fewest number of edges re-
quired to eulerize the graph in Fig. 25(b), so the eulerization is optimal. The 
eulerized graph in Fig. 25(c) has all even vertices, and an Euler circuit can be 
found. Since a circuit can be started at any vertex we will start the circuit at S. 
Figure 25(d) shows one of the many possible optimal routes for the security guard 
(just follow the numbers). Note that using a different starting vertex will not make 
the route shorter, so the security guard can continue parking in front of the donut 
shop—it will not hurt!
ExamplE 20  covErinG a 4-by-4 STrEET Grid
The graph in Fig. 24(a) models a 4-block-by-4-block street grid consisting of 40 
blocks. The 12 odd vertices in the graph are shown in red. We want to find a route 
that covers each of the 40 blocks of the street grid, ends back at the starting point, 
and has the fewest number of deadhead blocks. To do this, we first eulerize the 
graph by adding the fewest possible number of edges. Figure 24(b) shows how not 
to do it! This graph violates the cardinal rule of eulerization—you can only dupli-
cate edges that are part of the original graph. Edges DF and NL are new edges, not 
duplicates, so Fig. 24(b) is out! Figure 24(c) shows a legal eulerization, but it is not 
optimal, as it is obvious that we could have accomplished the same thing by adding 
fewer duplicate edges. Figure 24(d) shows an optimal eulerization of the original 
graph—one of several possible. Once we have an optimal eulerization, we have the 
blueprint for the optimal route on the street grid. Regardless of the specific details, 
we now know that the route will travel along 48 blocks—the 40 original blocks in 
the grid plus 8 deadhead blocks. A route can be found by using Fleury’s algorithm 
on the graph shown in Fig. 24(a). We leave the details to the reader. (By the way, 
in a grid such as this one, a route can be easily found using common sense and trial 
and error.)

ExamplE 22  ThE mail carriEr problEm SolvEd
The solution to the mail carrier problem follows essentially the 
same story line as the one for the security guard. Let’s recap this 
story: The mail carrier needs to start and end her route at the post 
office (P), cover both sides of the street when there are build-
ings on both sides, and cover just one side on blocks where there 
are buildings on only one side, with no need to cover any streets 
where there are no buildings (like the back side of the park and 
the school). Fig. 26 shows the graph model for the mail carrier 
(see Example 14). The interesting thing about this graph is that 
every vertex is already even (there are some vertices of degree 2 
in the corners, there are a couple of vertices of degree 6, and there 
are lots of vertices of degrees 4 and 8). This means that the graph 
does not have to be eulerized, as it has Euler circuits in its present 
form. An optimal route for the mail carrier can be found by finding an Euler circuit 
of the graph that starts and ends at P. We know how to do that and leave it as an 
exercise for the reader to find such a route. There are hundreds of possible routes 
that will work. (Note: Although Fleury’s algorithm is a sure bet, in a case like this 
trial and error is almost guaranteed to work best.)
Semi-Eulerizations
In cases where a street route is not required to end back where it started (either be-
cause we can choose to start and end in different places or because the starting and 
ending points are required to be different) we are looking for Euler paths, rather

In Example 3 we introduced the street-routing problem facing a UPS driver who 
has to make package deliveries around the Sunnyside neighborhood during the 
Christmas season. Figure 28(a) shows all the locations (marked with red crosses) 
where the driver must deliver packages. Figure 28(b) shows the graph model of 
the problem (see Example 15), with the odd vertices highlighted in red. Two of 
those odd vertices happen to be the designated starting and ending points of his 
route. We solve this problem by finding an optimal semi-eulerization of the graph 
with the starting and ending points left alone. One optimal semi-eulerization is 
shown in Fig. 28(c). It has 10 additional edges shown in red. These represent the 
deadhead blocks the driver will have to cover a second time. The last step is to 
find an Euler path in Fig. 28(c) with the designated starting and ending points—
that would give us an optimal route. This can be done using Fleury’s algorithm (or 
trial and error), and we leave this final detail as an exercise for the UPS driver.
ExamplE 23  ThE bridGES oF madiSon counTy SolvEd
In Example 5 we introduced the problem of routing a photographer across all the 
bridges in Madison County, shown in Fig. 27(a). To recap the story: The photog-
rapher needs to cross each of the 11 bridges at least once (for her photo shoot). 
Each crossing of a bridge costs $25, and the photographer is on a tight budget, so 
she wants to cover all the bridges once but recross as few bridges as possible. The 
other relevant fact is that the photographer can start her trip at either bank of the 
river and end the trip at either bank of the river. Figure 27(b) is a graph model 
of the Madison bridges layout. A la Euler, we let the vertices represent the land 
masses and the edges represent the bridges. The graph has four odd vertices (R, L, 
B, and D). The photographer can start the shoot at either bank and end at either 
bank—say she chooses to start the route at R and end it at L. Figure 27(c) shows a 
semi-eulerization of the graph in (b), with R and L left as odd vertices, and the edge 
BD (i.e., the Kennedy bridge) recrossed so that now B and D are even vertices. The 
numbers in Fig. 27(c) show one possible optimal route for the photographer, with a 
total of 12 bridge crossings and a total cost of $300.

than Euler circuits. In these cases we are looking for a graph that has two odd verti-
ces and the rest even. We need the two odd vertices to give us a starting and ending 
point for our route. The process of adding additional edges to a graph so that all the 
vertices except two are even is called a semi-eulerization, and we say that the graph 
has been semi-eulerized.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
Conclusion
In this chapter we got our first introduction to two fundamental ideas. First, we learned 
about a simple but powerful concept for describing relationships within a set of  
objects—the concept of a graph. This idea can be traced back to Euler, some 270 years 
ago. Since then, the study of graphs has grown into one of the most important and 
useful branches of modern mathematics.
The second important idea of this chapter is the concept of a graph model. Ev-
ery time we take a real-life problem and turn it into a mathematical problem, we 
are, in effect, modeling. Unwittingly, we have all done some form of mathematical 
modeling at one time or another—first using arithmetic and later using equations 
and functions to describe real-life situations. In this chapter we learned about a new 
type of modeling called graph modeling, in which we use graphs and the mathemati-
cal theory of graphs to solve certain types of routing problems.
By necessity, the routing problems that we solved in this chapter were fairly 
simplistic—crossing a few bridges, patrolling a small neighborhood, routing a UPS 
driver. We should not be deceived by the simplicity of these examples—larger-
scale variations on these themes have significant practical importance. In many 
big cities, where the efficient routing of municipal services (police patrols, gar-
bage collection, etc.) is a major issue, the very theory that we developed in this 
chapter is being used on a large scale, the only difference being that many of the 
more tedious details are mechanized and carried out by a computer. (In New York 
City, for example, garbage collection, curb sweeping, snow removal, and other 
municipal services have been scheduled and organized using graph models since 
the 1970s, and the improved efficiency has yielded savings estimated in the tens of 
millions of dollars a year.)

turesque hamlet of Kingsburg. You have been hired by 
the Kingsburg Chamber of Commerce to organize the

keeps the bridge crossings to a minimum and yet crosses 
each of the seven bridges in the downtown area at least 
once.

Exercises 66 through 68 refer to Example 23. In this example, 
the problem is to find an optimal route (i.e., a route with the

 Let us take an example of two islands with four rivers 
forming the surrounding water. There are fifteen bridges  
marked a, b, c, d, etc., across the water around the  
islands and the adjoining rivers. The question is whether  
a journey can be arranged that will pass over all the 
bridges but not over any of them more than once.
 
 What is the answer to Euler’s question? If the “journey” is 
possible, describe it. If it isn’t, explain why not.

degree. Let k denote the number of bridges in G. Find the

ces and two odd vertices. Let k denote the number of

 72. Suppose G is a disconnected graph with exactly two odd

same component of the graph.
 73. Suppose G is a simple graph with N vertices 1N Ú 22. Ex-

 74. Kissing circuits. When two circuits in a graph have no edges 
in common but share a common vertex v, they are said to be 
kissing at v.
 
(a) For the graph shown in Fig. 64, find a circuit kissing 
the circuit A, D, C, A (there is only one), and find two 
different circuits kissing the circuit A, B, D, A.
 
(b) Suppose G is a connected graph and every vertex in G 
is even. Explain why the following statement is true: 
If a circuit in G has no kissing circuits, then that circuit 
must be an Euler circuit.
 75. Hierholzer’s algorithm. Hierholzer’s algorithm is another 
algorithm for finding an Euler circuit in a graph. The basic 
idea behind Hierholzer’s algorithm is to start with an arbi-
trary circuit and then enlarge it by patching to it a kissing 
circuit, continuing this way and making larger and larger 
circuits until the circuit cannot be enlarged any farther. (For 
the definition of kissing circuits, see Exercise 74.) More for-
mally, Hierholzer’s algorithm is as follows:
 
 Step 1. Start with an arbitrary circuit C0.
 
 Step 2. Find a kissing circuit to C0. If there are no kissing 
circuits to C0, then you are finished—C0 is itself an Euler 
circuit of the graph [see Exercise 74(b)]. If there is a kissing 
circuit to C0, let’s call it K0, and let V denote the vertex at 
which the two circuits kiss. Go to Step 3.
 
 Step 3. Let C1 denote the circuit obtained by “patching” 
K0 to C0 at vertex V (i.e., start at V, travel along C0 back 
to V, and then travel along K0 back again to V). Now find 
a kissing circuit to C1. (If there are no kissing circuits to C1, 
then you are finished—C1 is your Euler circuit.) If there is 
a kissing circuit to C1, let’s call it K1, and let W denote the 
vertex at which the two circuits kiss. Go to Step 4.
 
 Steps 4, 5, and so on. Continue this way until there are no 
more kissing circuits available.
 
(a) Use Hierholzer’s algorithm to find an Euler circuit for 
the graph shown in Fig. 65 (this is the graph model for 
the mail carrier in Example 14).
 
(b) Describe a modification of Hierholzer’s algorithm that 
allows you to find an Euler path in a connected graph 
having exactly two vertices of odd degree. (Hint: A 
path can also have a kissing circuit.)
 69. This exercise comes to you courtesy of Euler himself. Here 
is the question in Euler’s own words, accompanied by the 
diagram shown in Fig. 63.

The Mathematics of Getting Around
 1 original Sources
Whenever possible, it is instructive to read about a great discov-
ery from the original source. Euler’s landmark paper in graph 
theory with his solution to the Königsberg bridge problem was 
published in 1736. Luckily, the paper was written in a very read-
able style and the full English translation can be found in the 
following article: “The Bridges of Konigsberg,” by Leonhard 
Euler (translated by James Newman), Scientific American, vol. 
89 (1953), pp. 66–70.
Write a summary/analysis of Euler’s original paper. Include 
(1) a description of how Euler originally tackled the Königsberg 
bridge problem, (2) a discussion of Euler’s general conclusions, 
and (3) a discussion of Euler’s approach toward finding an Euler 
circuit/path.
 2 computer representation of Graphs
In many real-life routing problems, we have to deal with very 
large graphs—a graph could have thousands of vertices and tens 
of thousands of edges. In these cases algorithms such as Fleury’s 
algorithm are done by computer. Unlike humans, computers are 
not very good at interpreting pictures, so the first step in using 
computers to perform computations with graphs is to describe 
the graph in a way the computer can understand it. The two most 
common ways to do so are by means of matrices.
In this project you are asked to write a short research paper 
describing the use of matrices to represent graphs. Explain (1) 
what is a matrix, (2) what is the adjacency matrix of a graph, 
and (3) what is the incidence matrix of a graph. Illustrate some 
of the graph concepts from this chapter (degrees of vertices, 
multiple edges, loops, etc.) in matrix terms. Include plenty of ex-
amples. You can find definitions and information on adjacency 
and incidence matrices of graphs in many graph theory books.
 3 The chinese postman problem
A weighted graph is a graph in which the edges are assigned posi-
tive numbers called weights. The weights represent distances, 
times, or costs. Finding optimal routes that cover all the edges of a 
weighted graph is a problem known as the Chinese postman prob-
lem. (Chinese postman problems are a generalization of Euler cir-
cuit problems and, as a general rule, are much harder to solve, but 
most of the concepts developed in this chapter still apply.)
In this project you are asked to prepare a presentation on 
the Chinese postman problem for your class.
Some suggestions: (1) Give several examples to illustrate 
Chinese postman problems and how they differ from corre-
sponding Euler circuit problems. (2) Describe some possible 
real-life applications of Chinese postman problems. (3) Discuss 
how to solve a Chinese postman problem in the simplest cases 
when the weighted graph has no odd vertices or has only two 
odd vertices (these cases can be solved using techniques learned 
in this chapter). (4) Give a rough outline of how one might at-
tempt to solve a Chinese postman problem for a graph with four 
odd vertices.

Traveling Salesman Problems
The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity is a six-wheeled rover that 
looks like a dune buggy on steroids and cost NASA $2.5 billion 
to build and launch. Curiosity, loaded with fancy cameras and 
all kinds of scientific instruments, left Cape Canaveral, Florida, on 
November 26, 2011 and landed on the Gale crater region of 
Mars on August 6, 2012. Curiosity’s mission is to explore an area 
around the Gale crater where planetary scientists believe there is 
a good chance of finding chemical and biological markers that 
might be evidence of past or present life. To put it simply, Curiosity 
is on the hunt for tiny Martians, dead or alive.

uriosity is built not for speed (it can cover only 600 to 700 feet per day) 
but rather for endurance and the ability to move over and around ob-
stacles that might appear in its path. In other words, Curiosity is a rug-
ged traveler, moving slowly but steadily through various locations on the rough and 
uncharted territory that is the surface of Mars. The less time Curiosity has to spend 
moving around, the more time it has to conduct its experiments, so one of the key  
aspects of Curiosity’s mission is to optimize its travels. This is where the mathematics 
comes in.
The general problem of optimizing the route of a traveler that must visit a speci-
fied set of locations is known as the traveling salesman problem (TSP). This name 
is misleading, and the typical traveling salesman problem has nothing to do with a 
traveling salesperson—the name applies to many important real-life problems, in-
cluding the routing of a $2.5- billion roving laboratory on the surface of Mars.
This chapter starts with a general description of what constitutes a TSP, 
 followed by several real-life examples of TSPs (Section 1). In Section 2 we introduce 
and discuss the key mathematical concepts that are used to model a TSP (Hamil-
ton circuits, Hamilton paths, and 
complete graphs). In Sections 3, 
4, and 5, we introduce four differ-
ent algorithms for solving TSPs: 
the brute-force, nearest-neighbor, 
re peti tive nearest-neighbor, and 
cheapest-link algorithms, and use 
these algorithms to “solve” the 
TSPs introduced in Section 1. 
In these sections we also discuss 
the pros and cons of the various 
algorithms and introduce the 
concepts of inefficient and ap-
proximate algorithms.

What Is a Traveling Salesman Problem?
1
The term traveling salesman problem (TSP) is catchy but a bit misleading, since most 
of the time the problems that fall under this heading have nothing to do with sales-
people living out of a suitcase. The expression “traveling salesman” has traditionally 
been used as a convenient metaphor for many different real-life problems that share 
a common mathematical structure.
The three elements common to all TSPs (from now on we simply refer to any 
traveling salesman problem as a TSP) are the following:
n A traveler. The traveler could be a person (or a group), an object (a bus, a truck, 
an unmanned rover, etc.); it could even be a bee.
n A set of sites. These are the places or locations the traveler must visit. We will 
use N to denote the number of sites.
n A set of costs. These are positive numbers associated with the expense of travel-
ing from a site to another site. Here the “cost” variable is not restricted to just 
monetary cost—it can also represent distance traveled or time spent on travel.
A solution to a TSP is a “trip” that starts and ends at a site and visits all the other 
sites once (but only once). We call such a trip a tour. An optimal solution (optimal 
tour) is a tour of minimal total cost. (Notice that we used a tour rather than the 
tour—in general a TSP has more than one optimal solution.)
Let’s now look at some examples that should help clarify the types of problems 
we call TSPs. We will not solve any of these TSPs in this section, but we will discuss 
solutions in later sections.
ExAmplE 2  ThE InTErplAnETAry mIssIon Tsp
It is the year 2050. An unmanned mission to explore the outer planetary moons in 
our solar system is about to be launched from Earth. The mission is scheduled to 
visit Callisto, Ganymede, Io, Mimas, and Titan (the first three are moons of Jupiter; 
the last two of Saturn), collect rock samples at each, and then return to Earth with 
the loot. The graph in Fig. 2 shows the time (in years) required for exploration and 
travel between any two moons, as well as between Earth and any moon.
This is a long mission, and one of the obvious goals of the mission is to complete 
it in the least time. In this TSP, the traveler is the expedition spaceship, the sites are 
the moons plus the starting and ending site Earth (N = 6), and the cost variable is 
time. As in Example 1, the goal is to find an optimal tour. We will solve the inter-
planetary moons TSP in Sections 3, 4, and 5.
ExAmplE 1  A rEAl TrAvElIng sAlEsmAn’s Tsp
Willy “the Traveler” is a traveling salesman who spends a lot 
of time on the road calling on customers. He is planning his 
next business trip, where he will visit customers in five cities we 
will call A, B, C, D, and E for short (N = 5). Since A is Willy’s 
hometown, he needs to start and end his trip at A.
The graph in Fig. 1 shows the cost (in dollars) of a one-
way ticket between any pair of cities (for simplicity we are  
assuming the cost of a one-way ticket is the same regardless of 
the direction of travel—something that is not always true in the 
crazy world of modern airline ticket prices). Like most people, 
Willy hates to waste money, so among the many possible ways 
he can organize the sales tour Willy wants to find the cheapest 
(i.e., an optimal tour). We will see the solution to Willy’s TSP 
in Section 3, but if you want to give it a try on your own now, 
please feel free to do so.

ExAmplE 3  ThE Curiosity Tsp
The story of the Mars Science Laboratory nicknamed Curiosity was introduced in 
the chapter opener. Curiosity is a six-wheeled $2.5-billion rover loaded with cam-
eras and instruments that roams around a region of Mars known as the Gale crater, 
collecting rocks and doing chemical and biological assays of the soil. The primary 
mission objective is to look for evidence of the existence of life (past or present) on 
Martian soil. The mission is expected to last approximately one Martian year (23 
months), and Curiosity is a slow traveler (about 660 feet a day), so efficient planning 
of its travels is a critical part of the mission. The specific details of where Curiosity is 
to roam were not available at the time of the writing of this example, so the details 
that follow are a fictional but realistic version of how the mission might evolve.
Figure 3(a) is a graph showing seven locations around the Gale crater (called 
G1 through G7) that Curiosity is going to visit, with G1 being the landing site. The 
numbers on each edge represent travel distances in meters. [To make some of these 
distances meaningful, consider the fact that Curiosity can cover only about 200 m a 
day, so the trek from say G2 to G5 (8000 m) would take roughly 40 days.] Note that 
in the graph the edges are not drawn to scale—as in any graph, the positioning of the 
vertices is irrelevant and the only data that are relevant in this case are the numbers 
(distances) associated with each edge. In spite of a conscious effort to render the 
graph as clear and readable as possible, it’s hard to get around the fact that there are 
a lot of numbers in the picture and things get pretty crowded. The distance chart in 
Fig. 3(b) provides exactly the same information as the graph in Fig. 3(a) but is a little 
easier to work with. [For TSPs with more than six sites (N 7 6), a chart is generally 
preferable to a graph.]

The Mathematics of Touring
Given the harsh conditions on Mars, Curiosity’s tour will be long and full of risks. 
As one might imagine, the goal is to find a tour that minimizes distance and thus 
takes the least amount of travel time. In this TSP, Curiosity is the traveler, N = 7, 
and the cost variable is distance. We will solve the Curiosity TSP in Section 5.
Beyond the TSPs introduced in Examples 1 through 4 (we will follow through 
on these later in the chapter), the following is a short list of other real-world applica-
tions where TSPs arise:
n school buses. A school bus (the traveler) picks up children in the morning and 
drops them off at the end of the day at designated stops (the sites). On a typical 
rural school bus route there may be 20 to 30 such stops. With school buses, total 
time on the bus is always the most important variable (students have to get to 
school on time), and there is a known time of travel (the cost) between any two 
bus stops. Since children must be picked up at every bus stop, a tour of all the 
sites (starting and ending at the school) is required. Since the bus repeats its 
route every day during the school year, finding an optimal tour is crucial.
n Circuit boards. In the process of fabricating integrated-circuit boards, tens of 
thousands of tiny holes (the sites) must be drilled in each board. This is done by 
using a stationary laser beam and moving the board (the traveler). To do this ef-
ficiently, the order in which the holes are drilled should be such that the entire 
drilling sequence (the tour) is completed in the least amount of time (optimal 
cost). This makes for a very high-tech TSP.
n Errands around town. On a typical Saturday morning, an average Joe or Jane 
(the traveler) sets out to run a bunch of errands around town, visiting various 
sites (grocery store, hair salon, bakery, post office). When gas was cheap, time 
used to be the key cost variable, but with the cost of gas these days, people are 
more likely to be looking for the tour that minimizes the total distance traveled 
(see Exercise 59 for an illustration of this TSP).
ExAmplE 4  ThE ConCErT Tour Tsp
The indie rock band Luna Park is planning a concert tour. The 10 cities booked for 
the tour (including the band’s home base A) and the distances between them are 
given in the mileage chart shown in Fig. 4. (Note that in this example we made no 
attempt to display the distances in a graph—to say the least, it would be messy.)
The goal is to find the shortest (i.e., optimal) concert tour. In this TSP the trav-
eler is the rock band (and their entourage), the sites are the cities in the concert tour 
(N = 10), and the cost variable is distance traveled. We will discuss and partially 
solve the concert tour TSP in Section 4.

The Mathematics of Touring
n Bees do it. In 2010, scientists at the University of London studying the travel 
patterns of foraging bumblebees as they search for their food source (flower 
nectar) made a surprising discovery: The bees fly from flower to flower not in 
the order in which they originally discover the flowers but in the order that gives 
the shortest overall route. In other words, the bees are routing their foraging 
trips by solving a TSP. Scientists still don’t understand what methods bumble-
bees use to solve such complex mathematical problems, but the answer is clearly 
not by doing numerical calculations—the brain of a bee is the size of a grain of 
sand. Understanding the shortcuts that allow a humble bumblebee to solve a 
TSP is important, as it may be possible to program the same shortcuts in modern 
computer algorithms used to solve large-scale TSPs.
Hamilton Paths and Circuits
2
In 1857, the Irish mathematician Sir William Rowan Hamilton invented a board 
game the purpose of which was to find a trip along the edges of the graph shown in 
Fig. 5 that visited each of the vertices once and only once, returning at the end to the 
starting vertex. Hamilton tried to market the game to make a little money, but he 
ended up just selling the rights to a London dealer for 25 pounds.
The only reason the story of Hamilton’s Icosian game is of any interest to us is 
that it illustrates an important concept in this chapter—that of traveling along the 
edges of a connected graph with the purpose of visiting each and every one of the 
vertices once (but only once). This leads to the following two definitions:
n hamilton path. A Hamilton path in a connected graph is a path that visits all 
the vertices of the graph once and only once.
n hamilton circuit. A Hamilton circuit in a connected graph is a circuit that visits 
all the vertices of the graph once and only once.
In spite of the similarities in the definitions, Hamilton paths and circuits are very 
different from Euler paths and circuits and the two should not be confused. With 
Hamilton the name of the game is to visit all the vertices of the graph once; with 
Euler the name of the game is to pass through all the edges of the graph once.

Figure 6 shows two graphs. The graph in Fig. 6(a) has no Ham-
ilton circuits because once you visit C you are stuck there. On 
the other hand, the graph has several Hamilton paths. One of 
them is C, D, E, B, A; another one is C, D, A, B, E. We can 
reverse those two paths and get two more: A, B, E, D, C and 
E, B, A, D, C. Clearly, the Hamilton path has to start or end at 
C, so the four Hamilton paths listed above are the only ones pos-
sible. Note that the graph has two odd vertices, so from Euler’s 
theorem for paths we know that it has Euler paths as well.
The graph in Fig. 6(b) has no Hamilton circuits because 
once you visit F (or G) you are stuck there. Nor does the graph have Hamilton 
paths: The path has to start at either F or G and end at the other one, and there 
is no way to visit the other five vertices without going through some vertices 
more than once. Note that this graph also has two odd vertices, so we know 
that it has an Euler path.

The graph in Fig. 7(a) has no Euler circuits or paths (it has four odd vertices) but 
has lots of Hamilton circuits. We are going to try to list them all. To organize our-
selves we will list the Hamilton circuits using A as the starting and ending point 
of the circuit. We’ll start by going clockwise around the outside square and taking 
the “detour” to visit E at different times in the trip. This gives the following four 
Hamilton circuits: (1) A, B, C, D, E, A; (2) A, B, C, E, D, A; (3) A, B, E, C, D, A; and 
(4) A, E, B, C, D, A. [Figure 7(b) illustrates circuit (1) A, B, C, D, E, A]. We can also 
go around the outside square counterclockwise and get four more Hamilton circuits: 
(5) A, D, C, B, E, A; (6) A, D, C, E, B, A; (7) A, D, E, C, B, A; and (8) A, E, D, C, 
B, A. Notice that these last four are reversals of the first four.
What about Hamilton circuits that start at a different vertex—say for example 
B? Fortunately, we won’t have to worry about finding more Hamilton circuits by 
changing the starting vertex. Any Hamilton circuit that starts and ends at B can be 
reinterpreted as a Hamilton circuit that starts and ends at A (or any other vertex, 
for that matter). For example, the circuit B, C, D, E, A, B is just the circuit A, B, C, 
D, E, A written in a different way [Fig. 7(b)]. In other words, a Hamilton circuit is 
defined by the ordering of the vertices and is independent of which vertex is used 
as the starting and ending point. This helps a great deal—once we are sure that we 
listed all the Hamilton circuits that start and end at A, we know that we have listed all 
of them! We will use this observation repeatedly in the next section.
In general, a graph has many more Hamilton paths than circuits. For one thing, 
each Hamilton circuit can be “broken” into a Hamilton path by deleting one of the 
edges of the circuit. For example, we can take the Hamilton circuit A, B, C, D, E, A 
shown in Fig. 7(b) and delete EA. This gives the Hamilton path A, B, C, D, E shown 
in Fig. 7(c). We can delete any other edge as well. If we delete CD from the Hamilton 
circuit A, B, C, D, E, A, we get the Hamilton path D, E, A, B, C [you can see this best 
if you look again at Fig. 7(b) and pretend the edge CD is gone]. You can do this with 
any of the eight Hamilton circuits of the graph—delete one of its edges and create a 
Hamilton path. This generates lots of Hamilton paths, so we will not list them all. On 
top of that, a graph can have Hamilton paths that are not “broken” Hamilton circuits. 
Figure 7(d) shows the Hamilton path A, B, E, D, C. This is not a path we would get 
from a Hamilton circuit—if it were we would be able to close it into a circuit, but to 
get from C back to A we would have to go through E once again. There are eight 
different Hamilton paths that do not come from Hamilton circuits, and we leave it to 
the reader to find the other seven (Exercise 9).

The following is a recap of the key points we should take away from Examples 
5 and 6:
n Some graphs have neither Hamilton paths nor Hamilton circuits [see Fig. 6 (b)].
n Some graphs have Hamilton paths but no Hamilton circuits [see Fig. 6(a)].
n Any graph that has Hamilton circuits will automatically have Hamilton paths 
because you can always “break” a Hamilton circuit into a Hamilton path by 
deleting one of the edges of the circuit [see Figs. 7(b) and (c)].
n A graph can have Hamilton paths that do not come from a “broken” Hamilton 
circuit [see Fig. 7(d)].

The Mathematics of Touring
n A Hamilton circuit or path can be reversed (i.e., traveled in the opposite 
direction). This gives a different Hamilton circuit or path. (Reversing the  
Hamilton circuit A, B, C, D, E, A gives the Hamilton circuit A, E, D, C, B, A.)
n The same Hamilton circuit can be written in many different ways by changing 
the chosen starting vertex. [A, B, C, D, E, A and B, C, D, E, A, B are two differ-
ent descriptions of the Hamilton circuit in Fig. 7(b).]
Complete graphs
A simple graph (i.e., no loops or multiple edges) in which the vertices are completely 
interconnected (every vertex is connected to every other vertex) is called a complete 
graph. Complete graphs are denoted by the symbol KN, where N is the number of 
vertices. Figure 8 shows the complete graphs for N = 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Property (1) follows from the definition of KN: since every vertex is adjacent 
to each of the other N - 1 vertices, the degree of each vertex is N - 1. Property (2)

has degree N - 1, the sum of all the degrees is N1N - 12 and the number of edges 
is 
N1N - 12

The Mathematics of Touring
How do we know that Fig. 9 shows all possible Hamilton circuits? In a complete 
graph you can go from any vertex to any other vertex. Starting at A one can go to 
either B, C, or D; from there to either of the other two, from there to the only one 
left, and finally come back to A. This gives us 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 different possibilities.
Each of the six Hamilton circuits can be broken into four different Hamilton 
paths (by deleting one of the edges). For example, the circuit in Fig. 9(a) gives us the 
following four Hamilton paths: (1) A, B, C, D; (2) B, C, D, A; (3) C, D, A, B; and (4) 
D, A, B, C. All in all, we get 6 * 4 = 24 Hamilton paths. Since the graph is complete, 
any Hamilton path can be closed into a Hamilton circuit (just join the starting and 
ending vertices of the path). It follows that there are no other possible Hamilton 
paths—just the 24 obtained from Hamilton circuits.

The 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 Hamilton circuits in K5 are shown in 
Table 1, written using A as the starting and ending vertex. Cir-
cuits (13) through (24) are the reversals of circuits (1) through 
(12), respectively. Any Hamilton circuit that starts and ends with 
A will have the other four “inside” vertices (B, C, D, and E) listed 
in between in some order. There are 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24 ways to 
list the letters B, C, D, and E in order: 4 choices for the first let-
ter, 3 choices for the second letter, 2 choices for the third letter, 
and a single choice for the last letter. This explains why Table 1 is 
a complete list of all the possible Hamilton circuits in K5.
There are 24 * 5 = 120 Hamilton paths in K5. For obvious 
reasons, we are not going to list them, but by now we should know 
how to generate them: Take any of the 24 Hamilton circuits and 
break it up by deleting one of its five edges. Figure 10 shows three 
of the 120 possible Hamilton paths: Fig. 10(a) is obtained by delet-
ing edge DA from circuit (2) on Table 1, and Fig. 10(b) is obtained 
by deleting edge BC from circuit (11). We leave it as an exercise 
for the reader to figure out how the Hamilton path in Fig. 10(c) 
comes about.

FIgurE 10 Three of the 120 possible Hamilton paths in K5.
When we generalize the preceding observations to a complete graph with N 
vertices we get the following improved version of properties (3) and (4):
 3. A Hamilton path in KN is equivalent to a permutation of the N vertices, and, 
therefore, the number of Hamilton paths is N!
 4. A Hamilton circuit in KN is equivalent to a permutation of the N - 1 
“inside” vertices (i.e., all vertices except the starting/ending vertex), and, there-
fore, the number of Hamilton circuits is 1N - 12!
Another way to count the number of Hamilton paths in K5 is to think in terms 
of permutations. Each Hamilton path in K5 is a permutation of the letters A, B, C, D, 
and E. It follows that the number of Hamilton paths equals the number of permuta-
tions of the five letters. This number is 5! = 120.

Table 2 shows the number of Hamilton circuits in KN for N = 3 through 12. The 
numbers get big fast: K10 has 362,800 Hamilton circuits; K11 has over 3.6 million; 
K12 has close to 40 million. To understand the implications of how fast these num-
bers grow, imagine that you want to make a list of all the Hamilton circuits in KN 
(like we did in Table 1 for K5). Suppose you work really fast and can write down a 
Hamilton circuit each second and that you are superhuman and can do this 24 hours 
a day, 7 days a week. It would then take you over four days to write down all the 
Hamilton circuits in K10, over a month to write down all the Hamilton circuits in K11, 
and well over a year to write down all the Hamilton circuits in K12.
A computer, of course, can do the job a lot faster than even the fastest  
human. Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that you have unlimited access to  
SUPERHERO, the fastest computer on the planet and that SUPERHERO can gen-
erate one quadrillion (i.e., a million billion) Hamilton circuits per second. SUPER-
HERO could crank out the Hamilton circuits of K12 in a matter of nanoseconds. 
Problem solved! Not so fast. Let’s up the ante a little and try to use SUPERHERO 
to generate the Hamilton circuits for K25. Surprise! It would take SUPERHERO
20 years to do it! Table 3 shows how long it would take for even the world’s fastest 
supercomputer to generate the Hamilton circuits in KN for values of N ranging from 
21 to 30. The numbers are beyond comprehension, and the implications will become 
clear in the next section.

In Example 1 we left Willy the traveling salesman hanging. What Willy would like 
from us, most of all, is to help him find the optimal (in this case cheapest) tour of the 
five cities in his sales territory. The cost of travel between any two cities is shown in 
Fig. 11 (this is exactly the same figure as Fig. 1). Notice that the underlying graph 
in Fig. 11 is just a fancy version of K5 (five vertices each adjacent to the other four) 
with numbers associated with each of the 10 edges. In this TSP the numbers repre-
sent the cost of travel (in either direction) along that edge.

The Mathematics of Touring
Table 4 lists the 24 possible tours that Willy could potentially take. The first 
and third columns of Table 4 gives the 24 different Hamilton circuits in K5. This 
part is an exact copy of Table 1. Notice once again that the list is organized so 
that each tour in the third column is the reversed version of the corresponding 
tour in the first column. Listing the tours this way saves a lot of work because the 
cost of a tour is the same regardless of the direction of travel: Once we know the 
cost of a tour we know the cost of its reversal. (Please note that this is true only 
because we made the assumption that the cost of travel between two cities is the 
same regardless of the direction of travel. When the costs vary with the direction 
of travel then the shortcut won’t work.) The middle column shows the total cost 
of each tour and the calculation that leads to it (for each tour just add the costs of 
the edges that make the tour).

Once we have the complete list of tours and their respective costs, we just choose 
the optimal tour(s). In this case, the optimal tours are (11) and its reversal (23). The 
cost is $676. Figure 12 shows both optimal tours.
A final note on Willy’s sales trip: Was doing all this work worth it? In this case, 
yes. If Willy just chose the order of the cities at random, the worst-case scenario 
would be tour (6) or (18), costing $877. With just a little effort we found an optimal 
tour costing $676—a potential savings of $201.

The Mathematics of Touring
Before moving on to other TSP examples, let’s connect a few dots. Our general 
assumption for a TSP is that there is a way to get from any location to any other loca-
tion. If we think of the locations as the vertices of a graph, this means that every TSP 
has an underlying graph that is a complete graph KN. In addition to the underlying 
graph, there are costs associated with each edge. A graph that has numbers associ-
ated with its edges is called a weighted graph, and the numbers are called weights. 
A tour in a TSP translates to a Hamilton circuit in the underlying graph, and an 
optimal tour translates into a Hamilton circuit of least total weight.
In short, the TSP is the concrete, real-life problem and its reformulation in terms 
of Hamilton circuits in a complete weighted graph is the mathematical model that 
represents the problem. In this model, locations are vertices, costs are weights, tours 
are Hamilton circuits, and optimal tours are Hamilton circuits of least total weight.
We can describe now the approach we used in Example 9 to solve Willy’s TSP in 
a somewhat more formal language: We made a list of all possible Hamilton circuits 
(first and third columns of Table 4), calculated the total weight of each (middle col-
umn of Table 4), and picked the circuits with least total weight. This strategy is 
formally known as the brute-force algorithm.

We are revisiting the TSP introduced in Example 2. In this TSP the goal is to find 
the fastest tour for an interplanetary mission to five of the outer moons in our solar 
system. Moreover, the tour has to start and end at our home planet, Earth. This 
makes it a TSP with N = 6 vertices. Figure 13(a) shows the mission time (in years) 
for travel between any two moons and between Earth and any moon.
To use the brute-force algorithm we would start with a list of all the possible 
Hamilton circuits using Earth as the starting and ending vertex. The problem is 
that this list has 5! = 120 different Hamilton circuits. That’s more work than we 
care to do, so a full list is out of the question. Imagine now that we get a hint: The 
first stop in an optimal tour is Callisto. How much help is that? A lot. It means that 
the optimal tour must be a Hamilton circuit of the form E, C, *, *, *, *, E. The *’s 
The brute-force algorithm is based on a simple idea—when you have a finite 
number of options, try them all and you will always be able to determine which one 
is the best. In theory, we should be able to use the brute-force algorithm to solve any 
TSP. In practice, we can solve only small TSPs this way. It’s easy to say “make a list 
of all the Hamilton circuits . . .”— doing it is something else. Just take a look again 
at Table 3. It would take the world’s fastest supercomputer 20 years to do it with K25; 
280 millions years to do it with K30. And keep in mind that in real-world applications 
a TSP with N = 30 locations is considered small. In some cases, a TSP might involve 
50 or even 100 locations.
The brute-force algorithm is a classic example of what is formally known as an ineffi-
cient algorithm—an algorithm for which the computational effort needed to carry out the 
steps of the algorithm grows disproportionately with the size of the problem. The trouble 
with inefficient algorithms is that they can only be used to solve small problems and, 
therefore, have limited practical use. Even the world’s fastest computer would be of little 
use when trying to solve a TSP with N = 25 locations using the brute-force algorithm.
Before we conclude this section we tackle one more example of how we might 
use the brute-force algorithm to solve a TSP.
In theory, there is no  
difference between theory 
and practice. In practice, 
there is.

are the letters G, I, M, and T in some order. Since there are only 4! = 24 possible 
permutations of these four letters, the brute-force algorithm becomes much more 
manageable: We make a list of the 24 Hamilton circuits of the form E, C, *, *, *, *, E, 
find their weights, and pick one (there are several) of least total weight. One of the 
optimal tours is shown in Fig. 13(b). The total length of this tour is 18.3 years. We 
leave it to the reader to verify the details.
In this section we introduce a new method for solving TSPs called the nearest-
neighbor algorithm (NNA). We will illustrate the basic idea of the nearest-neighbor 
algorithm using the interplanetary mission TSP once again. We found an optimal 
tour for this TSP in Example 10, so the point now is to see how the NNA does it.

Look at the graph in Fig. 13(a) once again and imagine planning the mission. Starting 
from Earth we could choose any of the moons for our first stop. Of all the choices, 
Callisto makes the most sense because in terms of travel time it is Earth’s “nearest 
neighbor”: Among the edges connecting E to the other vertices, EC is the one with 
the smallest weight. (Technically speaking we should call C the “smallest weight” 
neighbor, but that sounds a bit strange, so we use nearest neighbor as a generic term 
for the vertex connected by the edge of least weight.)
So we made it to Callisto. Where to next? Following the same logic, we choose  
to go to Callisto’s nearest neighbor Io. From Io we go to Ganymede (the near-
est neighbor we have not yet been to), from Ganymede to Mimas, from Mimas 
to Titan (the last moon left), and finally from Titan the mission comes back to 
Earth. This tour, called the nearest-neighbor tour, is shown in Fig. 14. The total 
length of this tour is 19.4 years, and that’s a bit of bad news. In Example 10 we 
found an optimal tour with total length 18.3 years—this tour is more than a year 
longer.

The Mathematics of Touring
Example 11 illustrates a common situation when trying to find solutions to 
TSPs. We can come up with very simple and fast methods for finding “good” 
tours, but these methods cut corners and don’t necessarily produce the “best” 
(optimal) tour.
Formally, we will use the term approximate algorithm to describe any algorithm 
for solving TSPs that produces a tour, but not necessarily an optimal tour. The nearest-
neighbor algorithm is an example of an approximate algorithm. We will discuss a dif-
ferent approximate algorithm called the cheapest-link algorithm in Section 5.
Obviously, approximate algorithms are important and useful. The question is 
why? Why do we bother with methods that give approximate solutions when our 
objective is to find an optimal solution? The answer is that we are making a tradeoff 
between the solution and the amount of effort it takes to find it. Like in many walks 
of life, the choice is between perfection and expediency. If it takes 20 years to find 
the optimal tour in a TSP with N = 25 locations but we can find a suboptimal tour 
(i.e., a tour that is close to optimal) in a matter of minutes, shouldn’t we consider the 
second a better option? Approximate algorithms are the mathematical version of 
the commonly used strategy of cutting corners for the sake of expediency.
To illustrate the usefulness of the nearest-neighbor algorithm we will now tackle 
a TSP with N = 10 cities.
ExAmplE 12  ThE ConCErT Tour Tsp And ThE nnA
In Example 4 we were introduced to the indie rock band Luna Park, just about to 
embark on a 10-city concert tour. Figure 15(a) shows the distances (in miles) be-
tween any two cities. Because the band members all live at A, the tour needs to start 
and end at A. The goal is to find the optimal (shortest distance) tour.
This is a TSP with N = 10 locations. Notice that we don’t see a complete weighted 
graph, but the mileage chart provides exactly the same information as the graph 
would (and it does it in a much cleaner way). The only way we know for finding an 
optimal tour is the brute-force algorithm, and to use brute force would mean making 
a list of 9! = 362,880 possible Hamilton circuits. Obviously, we are not about to do 
that, at least not without help. But, we now know of a quick-and-dirty shortcut— 
the nearest-neighbor algorithm. Let’s try it and see what we get.
To implement the nearest-neighbor algorithm from a chart we use the follow-
ing strategy: Start with the row labeled A, and look for the smallest number in that 
row. That number (119) identifies A’s nearest neighbor, in this case C. We now go 
to row C and look for C’s nearest neighbor. [Before we do that, it helps to cross out

the column for C (this helps make sure we don’t go back to C in the middle of the 
tour). For similar reasons we also crossed out the A-column.] The smallest number 
available in row C is 120, and it identifies C’s nearest-neighbor E. We now cross out 
the E-column and go to row E, looking for a nearest-neighbor. The smallest number 
available in row E is 199, and it identifies E’s nearest-neighbor D. We cross out the 
D-column and continue [Fig. 15(b) shows the mileage chart at this point]: From D 
to its nearest-available neighbor B (150), from B to J (379), from J to G (241), from 
G to K (235), from K to F (222), from F to the only city left H (211), and finally end 
the tour by returning to A (277). This is the nearest-neighbor tour: A, C, E, D, B, J, 
G, K, F, H, A, and it has a total length of 2153 miles.
Example 12 clearly illustrates the tradeoff between perfection and expediency. 
We found a concert tour for the band, and it took only a few minutes, and we did it 
without the aid of a computer. That’s the good news. But how good is the solution 
we found? More specifically, how much longer is the nearest-neighbor tour found 
in Example 12 than the optimal tour? To answer this question, we would need to 
know how long the optimal tour is. With the aid of a computer, special software, and 
a fair amount of effort, I was able to find the answer: The optimal concert tour has 
a total length of 1914 miles. This information allows us to look back and judge the 
“goodness” of the solution we found in Example 12. We do this by introducing the 
concept of relative error.
n relative error of a tour. Let C denote the total cost of a given tour and Opt de-
note the total cost of the optimal tour. The relative error e of the tour is given 
 
by e =
C - Opt
Opt
.
The best way to think of the relative error is as a percent (i.e., the amount of er-
ror expressed as a percent of the optimal solution).
We are now ready to pass judgment on the nearest-neighbor tour we found in 
Example 12: The relative error of the tour is e = 2153 - 1914
1914
 0.1249 = 12.49%. 
Is a relative error of 12.49% good or bad? The answer very much depends on the 
circumstances: When cost is a critical variable—say, for example, the timing of an 
interplanetary mission—an error of 12.49% is high. When cost is less critical—say, 
for example, the distance covered by a rock band traveling around in a fancy motor 
coach—an error of 12.49% might be OK.
The repetitive nearest-neighbor Algorithm
One of the interesting features of the nearest-neighbor algorithm is that the tour 
it produces depends on the choice of starting vertex. For the same TSP, a change 
in the choice of starting vertex can produce a different nearest-neighbor tour.  
(Note that this does not imply that the tours are always different—we might change

the starting vertex and still get the same tour.) This observation can help us squeeze 
better tours from the nearest-neighbor algorithm: Each time we try a different start-
ing vertex there is the chance we might get an improved tour; the more vertices we 
try, the better our chances. This is the key idea behind a refinement of the nearest-
neighbor algorithm known as the repetitive nearest-neighbor algorithm. Our next 
example illustrates how this strategy works.
ThE nEArEsT-nEIghBor AlgorIThm
n start: Start at the designated starting vertex. If there is no designated 
starting vertex pick any vertex.
n First step: From the starting vertex go to its nearest neighbor (i.e., the vertex 
for which the corresponding edge has the smallest weight).
n middle steps: From each vertex go to its nearest neighbor, choosing only 
among the vertices that haven’t been yet visited. (If there is more than one 
nearest neighbor choose among them at random.) Keep doing this until all 
the vertices have been visited.
n last step: From the last vertex return to the starting vertex. The tour that 
we get is called the nearest-neighbor tour.
ExAmplE 13  ThE ConCErT Tour Tsp rEvIsITEd
In Example 12 we used the nearest-neighbor algorithm to 
find a concert tour for the Luna Park rock band (this is the 
TSP introduced in Example 4). We used A as the starting 
and ending vertex because the band lives at A, so in some 
sense we had no choice. The tour we found had a total 
length of 2153 miles.
We are going to try the same thing again but now will 
 use B as the starting and ending vertex. (Let’s disregard for 
now the fact that the tour really needs to start and end at 
A. We’ll deal with that issue later.) From B we go to its 
nearest-neighbor C, from C to its nearest-neighbor A, from 
A to E, and so on. The work is a little tedious, but we can 
finish the tour in a matter of minutes. We leave the details 
to the enterprising reader, but the bottom line is that we 
end up with the tour B, C, A, E, D, J, G, K, F, H, B with a 
total length of 2427 miles.
We will now repeat this process, using each of the other 
vertices as the starting/ending vertex and finding the corre-
sponding nearest-neighbor tour. Figuring a couple of min-
utes per vertex, the process might take about 20 minutes. 
Table 5 summarizes the results. The first column shows the 
10 nearest-neighbor tours obtained by running over all possible starting/ending ver-
tices; the second column shows the total length of each tour. We are looking for 
the best among these. Tours (5) through (10) are all tied for best, each with a total 
length of 2033 miles. We can take any one of these tours, and get a nice improve-
ment over the original tour we found in Example 12.
What about the fact that none of these tours starts and ends at A? That’s easy 
to fix. We can take any of these tours and rewrite them so that they start and end 
at A. When we do that, regardless of which one we use, we get the tour A, D, B, J, 
G, K, F, H, E, C, A. We call this tour the repetitive nearest-neighbor tour. It is not an 
optimal tour, but an improvement over the nearest-neighbor tour nonetheless. (This
tour has a relative error e = 2033 - 1914
1914
 0.0622 = 6.22%.)
We conclude this section with a formal description of the nearest-neighbor and 
repetitive nearest-neighbor algorithms.

The Mathematics of Touring
ThE rEpETITIvE nEArEsT-nEIghBor AlgorIThm
n Let X be any vertex. Find the nearest-neighbor tour with X as the starting 
vertex, and calculate the cost of this tour.
n Repeat the process with each of the other vertices of the graph as the 
starting vertex.
n Of the nearest-neighbor tours thus obtained, choose one with least cost. If 
necessary, rewrite the tour so that it starts at the designated starting vertex. 
The tour that we get is called the repetitive nearest-neighbor tour.
Last, but not least, we will introduce a completely different approximate algorithm for 
solving TSPs called the cheapest-link algorithm (CLA). (The term “cheapest link” is 
used here to mean the same thing as “edge of least cost,” and the algorithm could just 
as well be called the “edge of least cost algorithm,” but “cheapest link” sounds a little 
better.) The idea is to piece together a tour by looking at all the possible links (i.e., 
edges) and always choosing the cheapest link available (with a couple of restrictions 
that we will discuss later). Unlike the nearest-neighbor algorithm, the order in which 
we piece the tour together has nothing to do with the order in which the vertices will 
be visited. It sounds complicated, but it’s not. We will illustrate the cheapest-link  
algorithm by revisiting some by now familiar examples, starting with the interplan-
etary mission TSP (Examples 2, 10, and 11). This is an important example in terms of 
understanding the inner workings of the cheapest-link algorithm—you are encour-
aged to read it carefully. It is also long, and doodling along will help you keep up with 
the details. Paper, a pencil, and a red pen are strongly recommended.

The graph in Fig. 16(a) is a repeat of Fig. 2. The weights of the edges represent the 
cost (in this case time) of travel between any two locations. We will now show how 
the cheapest-link algorithm handles this TSP.
n step 1. We start by scanning the graph in Fig. 16(a) looking for the cheapest 
link (edge). Here the cheapest link is the one connecting Mimas and Titan (0.6 
years). [For convenience we’ll denote it by MT (0.6).] We select that link and 
indicate that we are doing so by highlighting it in red.
n step 2. We go back to scanning the graph looking for the next cheapest link. We 
find CI (0.8) and proceed to highlight it in red. (Notice that the two red links are 
not connected, but it doesn’t matter at this point.)

The Mathematics of Touring
n step 3. Once again, we scan the graph looking for the next cheapest link and 
find IG (1.1). We highlight it in red.
n step 4. The next cheapest link in the graph is CG (1.5). We pick up our red 
pen and are about to highlight the link when we suddenly realize that this is 
not a good move. A red CG means that we would be forming a red circuit
C, I, G, C. But tours (Hamilton circuits) can’t contain partial circuits, so any 
edge that forms a partial circuit must be ruled out. (For convenience, we call this 
the partial-circuit rule.) So, even though CG is the next available cheapest link, 
we can’t choose it because of the partial-circuit rule. We indicate this fact by 
-
ing out CG (the 
 is like a little marker saying “do not travel along this link”). 
So, we try again. After CG, the next cheapest link is CE (3.1). No problem here, 
so we select it and highlight it in red.
n step 5. The next cheapest link in the graph is EG (3.2). If we were to highlight 
GE in red we would be forming the partial red circuit E, G, I, C, E. Because of 
the partial-circuit rule, we must 
-out EG. We scan the graph again and find 
that the next cheapest link is IE. If we were to highlight IE in red we would have 
the following problem: three red edges (IE, IG, and IC) meeting at one vertex. 
This is not possible in a tour, since it would require visiting that vertex more 
than once. (For convenience, we call this the three-edge rule.) So we 
-out IE 
as well. [If you are doodling along with this narration, your picture at this point 
should look something like Fig. 16(b).] The next four cheapest links in order are 
IM (4.7), IT (5.1), CM (5.2), and CT (5.6). They all have to be ruled out because 
of the three-edge rule. This leads us to GM (5.7). This edge works, so we select 
it and highlight it in red.
n step 6. Since N = 6 this should be the last step. The last step is a little easier 
than the others—there should be only one way to close the circuit. Looking at 
the graph we see that E and T are the two loose ends that need to be connected. 
We do that by adding the link ET. Now we are done.
This is the end of the busywork. We found a Hamilton circuit in the graph and 
from it we get two different tours, depending on the direction we choose to travel. 
Going clockwise gives the cheapest-link tour E, C, I, G, M, T, E with a total length 
of 19.4 years. Going counterclockwise gives us the reverse tour.
Notice that for the interplanetary mission TSP, the cheapest-link tour we just 
found is exactly the same as the nearest-neighbor tour we found in Example 11. This 
is a coincidence, and we should not read too much into it. In general, the cheapest- 
link tour is different from the nearest-neighbor tour, and there is no superiority of 
one over the other—sometimes the cheapest-link tour is better, sometimes it’s the 
other way around.
A formal description of the cheapest-link algorithm is given below.
ThE ChEApEsT-lInk AlgorIThm
n step 1. Pick the cheapest link available. (If there is more than one, ran-
domly pick one among the cheapest links.) Highlight the link in red (or any 
other color).
n step 2. Pick the next cheapest link available and highlight it.
n steps 3, 4, . . ., N 2 1. Continue picking and highlighting the cheapest 
available link that (a) does not violate the partial-circuit rule (i.e., does not 
close a partial circuit) or (b) does not violate the three-edge rule (i.e., does 
not create three edges meeting at the same vertex).
n step N. Connect the two vertices that close the red circuit. Once we have 
the Hamilton circuit, we can add a direction of travel (clockwise or counter- 
clockwise). Either one gives us a cheapest-link tour.
209

The Mathematics of Touring
Our next example illustrates how to implement the cheapest-link algorithm 
when we have to work from a chart rather than a graph. The main difficulty in this  
situation is that it is not easy to spot violations of the partial-circuit and three-edge 
rules when looking at a chart. A simple way around this difficulty is to create an 
auxiliary picture of the tour as it is being built, one edge at a time.
ExAmplE 15  ThE Curiosity Tsp And ThE ClA
We are finally going to take a look at the Curiosity TSP introduced in the chapter 
opener and described in Example 3. The seven locations (G1 through G7) that the 
Mars rover Curiosity must visit and the distances (in meters) between pairs of loca-
tions are given in Fig. 17(a). We will use the cheapest-link algorithm working di-
rectly out of the distance chart. All we will need is an additional auxiliary graph that 
will help us visualize the links as we move through the steps of the algorithm. Figure 
17(b) shows the auxiliary graph when we start—a blank slate of seven vertices G1 
through G7 and no edges.
n step 1. We scan the distance chart looking for the smallest possible number. 
(Note: In a distance chart the half below the diagonal is the mirror image of the 
half above the diagonal, so we have to scan only one of the two halves.) The 
smallest number is 1300, and it belongs to the edge G6G7. This is the cheapest 
link, and we select it. We indicate this by connecting G6 and G7 in the auxiliary 
graph.
n step 2. We scan the distance chart again looking for the next smallest num-
ber. The number is 1500, and it belongs to the edge G1G6. We select this 
edge and indicate that we are doing so by connecting G1 and G6 in the auxil-
iary graph.
n step 3. The next smallest number in the chart is 2000, and it belongs to the edge 
G4G5. We select this edge and connect G4 to G5 in the auxiliary graph.
n step 4. The next smallest number in the chart is 2200, and it belongs to the edge 
G1G7. When we go to the auxiliary graph we see that we can’t select this edge

because it would create the circuit G1, G7, G6, G1—a violation of the partial-
circuit rule. We 
-out G1G7 and scan the chart again, looking for the next small-
est number after 2200. Here there is a tie with two entries equal to 2800: G1G4 
and G3G7. We choose randomly one of these, say G1G4. This one is OK, and we 
select it by adding that edge to the auxiliary graph. At this point the auxiliary 
graph looks like Fig. 17(c).
n step 5. We now try G3G7, the other edge with a cost of 2800. It works, so we add 
the edge G3G7 to the auxiliary graph.
n step 6. The next smallest number in the chart is 2900, and it belongs to the edge 
G4G7. When we look at the auxiliary graph, we can see that this edge won’t work 
because it would create a violation of the three-edge rule, both at G4 and at G7. So, 
we 
-out the edge and look for the next smallest number. There are two entries tied 
at 3000: G4G6 and G2G3. Say we try G4G6 first. This choice violates both the three-
edge and partial-circuit rules, so we 
-it out. The second edge with weight 3000 is 
G2G3, and this one works. We select it, and add the edge to the auxiliary graph.
n step 7. This is the last step, so we can go directly to the auxiliary graph. We see 
that the only way to close the Hamilton circuit is to add the edge G2G5.
We now have a Hamilton circuit. A cheapest-link tour is shown in Fig. 17(d): 
G1, G4, G5, G2, G3, G7, G6, G1. The total length is 21,400 m. (Traveling in the op-
posite direction gives the other cheapest-link tour).
How good is the cheapest-link tour we found in Example 15? At this point we 
have nothing to compare it with, so we just don’t know. We will be able to answer 
the question in our next (and last) example.
Out of curiosity, we decided to find, once and for all, an optimal tour for Curiosity. 
Using a computer and the brute-force algorithm we checked all 720 Hamilton cir-
cuits and came up with a surprise: There are several optimal tours, and one of them 
happens to be the nearest-neighbor tour shown in Fig. 18(b). In other words, in the 
case of the Curiosity TSP the nearest-neighbor algorithm (in a sense the most basic 
of all TSP algorithms) produced an optimal solution—a nice (and lucky) turn of 
events. Too bad we can’t count on this happening on a consistent basis. 
ExAmplE 16  ThE Curiosity Tsp And ThE nnA
We know only one way to find the optimal tour for the Curiosity TSP—use the 
brute-force algorithm, but this would require us to create a list with 6! = 720 Ham-
ilton circuits. That’s a lot of circuits to check out by hand.
A less ambitious approach is to try the nearest-neighbor algorithm and hope 
we get a good approximate tour. We leave the details as an exercise for the 
reader, but here it is: the nearest-neighbor tour (starting at G1) is G1, G6, G7, G3, 
G2, G4, G5, G1 [Fig. 18(b)]. The total length of this tour is 20,100 m. This is a respect-
able improvement over the cheapest-link tour found in Example 15.

The Mathematics of Touring
Conclusion
TSP is the acronym for traveling salesman problem. TSPs are some of the most im-
portant and perplexing problems in modern mathematics. Important because there 
is a wide range of real-life applications that can be modeled by TSPs, and perplexing 
because nobody knows a general algorithm for finding optimal solutions to TSPs that 
works no matter how large the number of vertices is. It’s likely that an optimal and effi-
cient general algorithm for solving TSPs is a mathematical impossibility along the lines of 
Arrow’s Impossibility Theorem , but unlike Arrow, nobody has been able to prove this 
as a mathematical fact. Great fame and fortune await the first person that can do this.
Alternatively, there are many good approximate algorithms that can produce 
suboptimal (i.e., approximate) solutions to TSPs even when the number of vertices 
is very large. These algorithms represent a departure from the traditional notion 
that a math problem can have only one answer or that an answer is either right or 
wrong. We discussed several approximate algorithms for solving TSPs and learned 
an important lesson: some math problems can have a perfect solution or an approxi-
mate solution. When the perfect solution is beyond the human ability to compute 
it, a good approximate solution that is easy to compute is not such a bad thing. Re-
gardless of how we choose to tackle traveling salesman problems, the acronym TSP 
should not stand for Totally Stumped and Perplexed.

a circular table, and you want to arrange the seating so that each 
guest is seated between two friends (i.e., the guests to the left and 
to the right are friends of the guest in between). You can assume 
that all friendships are mutual (when X is a friend of Y, Y is also 
a friend of X).
 60. Suppose that you are told that all possible friendships can 
be deduced from the following information:
 
 A is friends with B and F; B is friends with A, C, and E; C is 
friends with B, D, E, and F; E is friends with B, C, D, and F.
 
(a) Draw a “friendship graph” for the dinner guests.
 
(b) Find a possible seating arrangement for the party.
 
(c) Is there a possible seating arrangement in which B and 
E are seated next to each other? If there is, find it. If 
there isn’t, explain why not.
 61. Suppose that you are told that all possible friendships can 
be deduced from the following information:
 
 A is friends with C, D, E, and F; B is friends with C, D, 
and E; C is friends with A, B, and E; D is friends with A, 
B, and E.
 
 Explain why it is impossible to have a seating arrangement 
in which each guest is seated between friends.
 62. If the number of edges in K500 is x and the number of edges 
in K502 is y, what is the value of y - x?
 63. A 2 by 2 grid graph. The graph shown in Fig. 51 represents 
a street grid that is 2 blocks by 2 blocks. (Such a graph is 
called a 2 by 2 grid graph.) For convenience, the vertices are 
labeled by type: corner vertices C1, C2, C3, and C4, boundary 
vertices B1, B2, B3, and B4, and the interior vertex I.
 
(a) Find a Hamilton path in the graph that starts at I.
 
(b) Find a Hamilton path in the graph that starts at one 
of the corner vertices and ends at a different corner  
vertex.
 
(c) Find a Hamilton path that starts at one of the corner 
vertices and ends at I.
 
(d) Find (if you can) a Hamilton path that starts at one of 
the corner vertices and ends at one of the boundary 
vertices. If this is impossible, explain why.

 69. Nick is a traveling salesman. His territory consists of the 11 
cities shown on the mileage chart in Fig. 54. Nick must find 
a tour that starts and ends in Dallas (that’s his home) and

(a) Suppose that the rental car company charges 39 cents 
per mile plus a drop off fee of $250 if A and D are dif-
ferent cities (there is no charge if A = D). Find the op-
timal (cheapest) route and give the total cost.
 
(b) Suppose that the rental car company charges 49 cents 
per mile but the car can be returned to any city without 
a drop off fee. Find the optimal route and give the total 
cost.

 71. Complete bipartite graphs. A complete bipartite graph is 
a graph with the property that the vertices can be divided 
into two sets A and B and each vertex in set A is adjacent 
to each of the vertices in set B. There are no other edges! If 
there are m vertices in set A and n vertices in set B, the com-
plete bipartite graph is written as Kn, n. Figure 56 shows a 
generic bipartite graph.
 
(a) For n 7 1, the complete bipartite graphs of the form 
Km, n all have Hamilton circuits. Explain why.
 70. Julie is the marketing manager for a small software com-
pany based in Boston. She is planning a sales trip to Michi-
gan to visit customers in each of the nine cities shown on 
the mileage chart in Fig. 55. She can fly from Boston to any 
one of the cities and fly out of any one of the cities back to 
Boston for the same price (call the arrival city A and the 
departure city D). Her plan is to pick up a rental car at A, 
drive to each of the other cities, and drop off the rental car 
at the last city D. Slightly complicating the situation is that 
Michigan has two separate peninsulas—an upper peninsula 
and a lower peninsula—and the only way to get from one to 
the other is through the Mackinaw Bridge connecting Che-
boygan to Sault Ste. Marie. (There is a $3 toll to cross the 
bridge in either direction.)

(b) If either m or n is even and the other one is odd, then 
the m by n grid graph has a Hamilton circuit. Describe 
the circuit by drawing it on a generic graph.
 
(c) If m and n are both even, then the m by n grid graph 
does not have a Hamilton circuit. Explain why a  
Hamilton circuit is impossible.
 73. ore’s theorem. A connected graph with N vertices is said to 
satisfy Ore’s condition if deg1X2 + deg1Y2 Ú N for every 
pair of vertices X and Y of the graph. Ore’s theorem states 
that if a graph satisfies Ore’s condition, then it has a Hamilton 
circuit.
 
(a) Explain why the complete bipartite graph Kn, n (see 
Exercise 71) satisfies Ore’s condition.
 
(b) Explain why for m  n, the complete bipartite graph 
Km, n (see Exercise 71) does not satisfy Ore’s condition.
 
(c) Ore’s condition is sufficient to guarantee that a con-
nected graph has a Hamilton circuit but is not a nec-
essary condition. Give an example of a graph that 
has a Hamilton circuit but does not satisfy Ore’s con-
dition.

and deg1X2 Ú N

quence of Ore’s theorem.
 
(b) If the difference between m and n is exactly 1 (i.e., 
0 m - n0 = 1), the complete bipartite graph Km, n has a 
Hamilton path. Explain why.
 
(c) When the difference between m and n is more than 1, 
then the complete bipartite graph Km, n has neither a 
Hamilton circuit nor a Hamilton path. Explain why.
 72. m by n grid graphs. An m by n grid graph represents a rect-
angular street grid that is m blocks by n blocks, as indicated 
in Fig. 57. (You should try Exercises 63 through 66 before 
you try this one.)

 1 The nearest-Insertion Algorithm
The nearest-insertion algorithm is another approximate algo-
rithm used for tackling TSPs. The basic idea of the algorithm 
is to start with a subcircuit (a circuit that includes some, but not 
all, of the vertices) and enlarge it, one step at a time, by adding 
an extra vertex—the one that is closest to some vertex in the 
circuit. By the time we have added all of the vertices, we have a 
full-fledged Hamilton circuit.
In this project, you should prepare a class presentation on 
the nearest-insertion algorithm. Your presentation should include 
a detailed description of the algorithm, at least two carefully 
worked-out examples, and a comparison of the nearest-insertion 
and the nearest-neighbor algorithms.
 2 Computing with dnA
DNA is the basic molecule of life—it encodes the genetic in-
formation that characterizes all living organisms. Due to the 
recent great advances in biochemistry, scientists can now snip, 
splice, and recombine segments of DNA almost at will. In 
1994, Leonard Adleman, a professor of computer science at 
the University of Southern California, was able to encode a 
graph representing seven cities into a set of DNA segments 
and to use the chemical reactions of the DNA fragments to un-
cover the existence of a Hamilton path in the graph. Basically, 
he was able to use the biochemistry of DNA to solve a graph 
theory problem. While the actual problem solved was insignifi-
cant, the idea was revolutionary, as it opened the door for the 
possibility of someday using DNA computers to solve prob-
lems beyond the reach of even the most powerful of today’s  
electronic computers.
Write a research paper telling the story of Adleman’s 
landmark discovery. How did he encode the graph into 
DNA? How did he extract the mathematical solution (Ham-
ilton path) from the chemical solution? What other kinds of 
problems might be solved using DNA computing? What are 
the implications of Adleman’s discovery for the future of  
computing?

ized, spontaneous type of intelligence that has many potential 
applications at the human scale. In recent years, computer sci-
entists have been able to approach many difficult optimization 
problems (including TSPs) using ant colony optimization soft-
ware (i.e., computer programs that use virtual ants to imitate the 
problem-solving strategies of real ants).
Write a research paper describing the concept of swarm intel-
ligence and some of the recent developments in ant colony opti-
mization methods and, in particular, the use of virtual ant algo-
rithms for solving TSPs.
 3 Ant Colony optimization
An individual ant is, by most standards, a dumb little creature, but 
collectively an entire ant colony can perform surprising feats of 
teamwork (such as lifting and carrying large leaves or branches)  
and self-organize to solve remarkably complex problems (find-
ing the shortest route to a food source, optimizing foraging strat-
egies, managing a smooth and steady traffic flow in congested 
ant highways). The ability of ants and other social insects to 
perform sophisticated group tasks goes by the name of swarm 
intelligence. Since ants don’t talk to each other and don’t have 
bosses telling them what to do, swarm intelligence is a decentral-
Solution to Hamilton’s Icosian game 
(Fig. 5).

  (c)  CI is a bridge of the graph connecting a “left half” and a “right 
half .” If you start at C and go left, there is no way to get to the 
right half of the graph without going through C again. Conversely, 
if you start at C and cross over to the right half first, there is no 
way to get back to the left half without going through C again.
  (d)  No matter where you start, you would have to cross the bridge 
CI twice to visit every vertex and get back to where you started.
15. There is no Hamilton circuit since two vertices have degree 1. There is 
no Hamilton path since any such path must contain edges AB, BE,

The 
Mathematics 
of Networks
The Cost of Being Connected
What do Facebook, the Internet, your family, the electrical power 
grid, the interstate highway system, and the veins and arteries in 
your body have in common? They all share the same fundamental 
structure—they are networks.
While the word network is used today in many different 
contents (social network, computer network, telecommunications 
network, etc.), there is a common thread to all of them—a network 
connects things. So, for the purposes of this chapter we will use 
the term network to mean a connected graph.
Kimihiro Hoshino/AFP/Getty Images/Newscom

 hether we want to or not, we all belong to many different networks. Some 
are good (our families); some are not so good (the alumni association call-
ing for a donation every other week); some are useful (the Internet); some 
are addictive (Facebook). Because of the ubiquitous role networks play in our lives, 
the study of networks has flourished in the last 20 years. Sociologists, economists, 
engineers, and urban planners all study different aspects of the theory of networks, 
but when you peel off all their layers, networks are basically mathematical struc-
tures.
The purpose of this chapter is to give a very general introduction to the math-
ematics of networks and related structures such as trees and spanning trees. Section 1  
starts with several real-life examples of networks. By necessity, the size of the net-
works discussed is scaled down, but the general ideas can be applied at much big-
ger scales. Section 1 also introduces an important type of network called a tree. 
Section 2 introduces the concept of a spanning tree of a network. Section 2 
deals with optimization questions: What is a minimum spanning tree (MST) in 
a weighted network? What is a maximum spanning tree (MaxST)? Why do we 
care? We conclude the chapter with a discussion of Kruskal’s algorithm (Sec. 3). 
Kruskal’s algorithm is a simple method for finding minimum and maximum spanning 
trees in weighted 
networks. The al-
gorithm works effi-
ciently on networks 
regardless of their 
size, it always gives 
an optimal solution, 
and, most impor-
tant, it is extremely 
easy to implement. 
When it comes to 
optimization prob-
lems one can’t ask 
for better karma.

The Mathematics of Networks
Networks and Trees
Networks
A network is a just another name for a connected graph. (In the context of networks, 
vertices are often called nodes and edges are called links.) Most of the networks we 
will consider in this chapter will be simple networks (i.e., without loops or multiple 
edges), but we do not make this a requirement. In some applications, a network can 
have loops, multiple edges, or both.
Our first example illustrates how social networks evolve. Social networks—such 
as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram—are networks that connect people through 
some sort of social relationship—friendship, business, etc. The example is small, but 
you can imagine the same idea working on a much larger scale.
Because a network is a connected graph, there are paths going from any vertex 
to any other vertex—at least one but usually many more. We are usually interested in 
the shortest path connecting a pair of vertices—in other words, a path whose length is 
as small as possible. We will call the length of a shortest path joining two vertices in a 
network the degree of separation of the two vertices.
ExamplE 1 
Social NEtworkS
Imagine 15 students (named A through O) enrolled in a very popular seminar called 
The Mathematics of Social Networks. One of the goals in a small seminar like this one 
is to get the students to connect with each other and exchange ideas as much as pos-
sible, in other words, to “network.” For the purposes of this example we will say that 
two students in the seminar have connected if they have exchanged phone numbers or 
email addresses (presumably for the purposes of intellectual exchange, but we won’t 
really dwell into their reasons for doing so). We can best visualize the interconnections 
among students in the seminar by means of a connections graph: the vertices (nodes) 
of the graph are the students, and pairs of students are linked by an edge if they have 
connected according to our definition of the term.
Figure 1(a) shows one possible version of the connections graph. In this sce-
nario the graph is not a network but rather three separate, disconnected networks. 
Looking at this graph would not make the instructor happy. Figure 1(b) shows 
the new connections graph after two additional connections have been added: 
EG and CH. Now the graph becomes a true social network. The instructor is much 
happier—all students can connect, either directly or through intermediaries.

The Mathematics of Networks
Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn are examples of organic 
networks—networks that evolve and change on their own without any organized or 
centralized planning. In contrast to these, there are planned networks that are designed 
with a specific purpose in mind. Our next example illustrates on a very small scale one 
of the most important planned networks in modern life—the electrical power grid.
n A and B are joined by an edge, so we will say there is one degree of separation 
between them.
n A and G are not directly connected, but there is a path of length 2 connecting them: 
A, E, G. We will say that there are two degrees of separation between A and G.
n A and K are connected by the path A, C, H, M, L, K of length 5, but this is not as 
short as possible. The path A, C, H, L, K has length 4. Can we do even better? No. 
There is a second path of length 4 (A, C, H, I, K), but there are no paths of length 
3 or less (to connect A and K one must go through H—that requires at least two 
edges; to connect H and K requires at least two more edges.) It follows that the 
degree of separation between A and K is four.
n N and M are pretty far apart—the shortest possible path connecting them is N, G, 
E, C, H, M. There you are—five degrees of separation.
n There are several pairs of students in this seminar with six degrees of separation 
between them. Can you find a couple?
The network in Fig. 2 is an example of what we call a weighted network. Each 
edge has a weight that we will generally think of as representing a cost (either money, 
time, or distance). We will deal with weighted networks later in the chapter. In almost 
all weighted network problems the weights are positive numbers, but later in this chap-
ter we will make an exception and consider weighted networks where the weights are 
negative numbers.

powEr griDS
Figure 2(a) shows a map of the main Texas power grid. Figure 2(b) shows a small sec-
tion of the power grid connecting 14 small towns labeled A through N. In this graph 
a small section of the vertices represent the towns and the edges represent the main 
power lines that carry electricity to the various towns. The graph is connected, so it 
is indeed a network—any town can draw power from the grid. In addition, there is a 
weight associated with each edge of the network. In this case the weight of an edge 
represents the length (in miles) of the power line connecting the two towns. [Figure 
2(b) is not drawn to exact scale but is close. The reason for this is that the length of the 
power line is usually close to, but not necessarily the same, as the distance between 
the towns.]
We will return to this example in Section 3.

trees
The second important concept in this chapter is that of a tree. We all know that trees 
are important, as they provide shade and help clean up our air, but in the context of this 
chapter the term tree means a network that has no circuits.
ExamplE 4 
trEES aND rootS
Figure 3 shows three networks.
n The network shown in Fig. 3(a) has the circuit A, B, G, F, E, D, H, A. It is not a tree.
n The network in Fig. 3(b) has no circuits. It is a tree. (What might look like a circuit 
in the picture is not—the crossing points of edge HD with edges BG and CG are 
just crossing points and not vertices.) This tree may not look very tree-like, but we 
can fix that easily.
n It is obvious that the network in Fig. 3(c) has no circuits. It is a tree, and it looks 
the part. Surprisingly, this tree is the same tree as the one shown in Fig. 3(b). We 
just picked one of the vertices to be the “root” of the tree (in this case B) and 
built the “branches” of the tree up from the root. We can do this with any tree: 
Pick any vertex to be the root and build the tree up from there. Figure 4 shows 
two more versions of the same tree—in Fig. 4(a) the tree is rooted at A; in Fig. 
4(b) the tree is rooted at D. (Both trees are shown sideways with the root on the 
left—just trying to not waste space on the page . . . and save some real trees!)

Trees have three  key properties that distinguish them from ordinary networks. 
We will introduce the three properties first, illustrate them with an example, and 
conclude this section with a more formal version of these properties.
n the single-path property. In a tree, there is only one path connecting two vertices. 
If there were two paths connecting a pair of vertices, those two paths would create 
a circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Conversely, a network that is not a tree must have 
at least one circuit, and that circuit will always provide alternative paths between 
its vertices. Look at Fig. 5 again: Given a circuit and two vertices (X and Y) in the 
circuit, there are at least two different paths (red and blue) connecting X and Y.
FigurE 5 Two different paths 
joining X and Y make a circuit.

The Mathematics of Networks
n the all-bridges property. In a tree, every edge is a bridge. Essentially this means 
that a tree has no edges to spare—if we were to delete any edge, the tree would 
become disconnected and would no longer be a network. Figure 6 illustrates why 
every edge must be a bridge: Imagine an edge AB that is not a bridge. Then there 
would have to be an alternate path from A to B (shown as the dashed red curve). 
But AB together with the alternate path from A to B would form a circuit, and a 
tree doesn’t have circuits. Conversely, if every edge of the network is a bridge then 
the network must be a tree.
n the N  1 edges property. A tree with N vertices has N - 1 edges. Always. This 
means that no matter what the shape of the tree is, the number of edges is one 
less than the number of vertices. The tree in Fig. 4 has N = 8 vertices. We don’t 
even have to check—the number of edges must be 7. Conversely, a network with 
N vertices and N - 1 edges must be a tree.
From the above properties of trees we inherit the following key property of 
networks: In a network with N vertices and M edges, M Ú N - 1 (i.e., the number of 
edges is at least N - 1). When M = N - 1 the network is a tree; when M 7 N - 1 the 
network has circuits. The difference between the number of edges M and the mini-
mum possible number of edges N - 1 is an important number called the redundancy 
of the network.
FigurE 6 If AB is not a bridge, 
then it must be part of a circuit.
A
B
n redundancy of a Network. In a network with N vertices and M edges, the redun-
dancy R is given by R = M - (N - 1). [R = 0 means the network is a tree; R 7 0 
means the network is not a tree.]
As soon as you get to M = 7 (and if you stayed away from forming any cir-
cuits) the graph becomes connected. Some of the possible configurations are  
shown in Fig. 8. Each of these networks has redundancy R = 0 and is, therefore, 
a tree, and now each of the seven edges is a bridge. Stop here and you will come 
out $70 richer.
ExamplE 5 
coNNEct thE DotS (aND thEN Stop)
Imagine the following “connect-the-dots” game: Start with eight isolated vertices. 
The object of the game is to create a network connecting the vertices by adding 
edges, one at a time. You are free to create any network you want. In this game, 
bridges are good and circuits are bad. (Imagine, for example, that for each bridge 
in your network you get a $10 reward, but for each circuit in your network you pay 
a $10 penalty.)
So grab a marker and start playing. We will let M denote the number of edges you 
have added at any point in time. In the early stages of the game 1M = 1, 2, c, 62 the 
graph is disconnected [Figs. 7(a) through (d)].

Interestingly, this is as good as it will get. When M = 8 (R = 1), the graph will 
have a circuit—it just can’t be avoided. In addition, none of the edges in that circuit 
can be bridges of the graph. As a consequence, the larger the circuit that we create, 
the fewer the bridges left in the graph. [The graph in Fig. 9(a) has a circuit and five 
bridges, the graph in Fig. 9(b) has a circuit and two bridges, and the graph in Fig. 
9(c) has a circuit and only one bridge.] As the redundancy increases, the number of 
circuits goes up (very quickly) and the number of bridges goes down [Figs. 10(a), 
(b), and (c)].

FigurE 8 When M = 7, we have a tree (R = 0).
Our preceding discussion of trees and networks can be rephrased and summa-
rized in the following two key observations (and respective conclusions):
n A tree is a minimally connected network. This means that every edge of the tree 
is needed to keep it connected—in a tree every edge is a bridge, and there are no 
redundant edges (zero redundancy). This also means that the number of edges is 
always one less than the number of vertices (R = 0 implies M = N - 1). Conclu-
sion 1: If you want to minimize the number of edges in a network, build a tree.
n A network that is not a tree must have some redundant edges (positive redundancy). 
The redundant edges form circuits, and the higher the redundancy the more cir-
cuits in the network. Each circuit creates additional paths for connecting vertices 
in the circuit, so the more circuits the more ways there are to get around in the 
network. Conclusion 2: If you want to have lots of alternative routes to get around in 
a network, increase its redundancy.

The network in Fig. 13(a) is the same network as the one in Fig. 11(a). The 
redundancy of the network is R = 2, so to find a spanning tree we will have to 
“discard” two edges. Edges AB and AH are bridges of the network, so they will 
have to be part of any spanning tree. The other seven edges are split into two sepa-
rate circuits (B, C, G, B of length 3 and C, D, E, F, C of length 4). A spanning tree 
can be found by “busting” each of the two circuits. This means excluding any one 
of the three edges of circuit B, C, G, B and any one of the four edges of circuit

Spanning trees
A spanning tree in a network is a subtree of the network that spans all the vertices. The 
easiest way to explain the meaning of this definition is with a few examples.
ExamplE 6 
SubtrEES aND SpaNNiNg trEES
Figure 11(a) shows a small network with 8 vertices and 9 edges. Figure 11(b) shows 
(in red) a subtree of the network. The name subtree comes from the fact that the red 
tree has its vertices and edges inside the network. The subtree in Fig. 11(b) does not 
include all the vertices, but the one in Fig. 11(c) does. We say that the subtree in Fig. 
11(c) spans the network, and we call such subtrees spanning trees of the network. 
The spanning tree in Fig. 11(c) has 7 edges, and any other spanning tree of this net-
work will have 7 edges as well.

The network in Fig. 12(a) has N = 8 vertices and M = 8 edges. The redundancy of 
the network is R = 1. To find a spanning tree we will have to “discard” one edge. 
Five of these edges are bridges of the network, and they will have to be part of any 
spanning tree. The other three edges (BC, CG, and GB) form a circuit of length 3, 
and if we exclude any one of the three edges, then we will have a spanning tree. 
Thus, the network has three different spanning trees [Figs. 12(b), (c), and (d)].

The network in Fig. 14(a) is another network with 8 vertices and redundancy R = 2. 
The difference between this network and the one in Fig. 13(a) is that here the cir-
cuits B, C, G, B and C, D, E, G, C share a common edge CG. Determining which 
pairs of edges can be excluded in this case is a bit more complicated.
If one of the excluded edges is the common edge CG, then the other excluded 
edge can be any other edge in a circuit. There are five choices (BC, CD, DE, EG, and 
GB), and each choice will result in a different spanning tree [one of these is shown 
in Fig. 14(b)]. The alternative scenario is to exclude two edges neither of which is 
the common edge CG. In this case one excluded edge has to be either BC or BG (to 
“bust” circuit B, C, G, B), and the other excluded edge has to be either CD, DE, or 
EG (to “bust” circuit C, D, E, G, C). There are 2 * 3 = 6 possible spanning trees that 
can be formed this way [one of these is shown in Fig. 14(c)]. Combining the two sce-
narios gives a total of 11 possible spanning trees for the network in Fig. 14(a).

thE amazoNiaN cablE NEtwork
The Amazonia Telephone Company is contracted to provide telephone, cable, and 
Internet service to the seven small mining towns shown in Fig. 15(a). These towns 
are located deep in the heart of the Amazon jungle, which makes the project par-
ticularly difficult and expensive. In this environment the most practical and envi-
ronmentally friendly option is to create a network of underground fiber-optic cable 
lines connecting the towns. In addition, it makes sense to bury the underground 
C, D, E, F, C. For example, if we exclude BC and CD, we get the spanning tree 
shown in Fig. 13(b). We could also exclude BC and DE and get the spanning tree 
shown in Fig. 13(c), and so on. Given that there are 3 * 4 = 12 different ways to 
choose an edge from the circuit of length 3 and an edge from the circuit of length 
4, we will not show all 12 spanning trees. [Figs. 13(b) through (e) show some of 
them.]

cable lines along the already existing roads connecting the towns. The existing  
network of roads is shown in Fig. 15(a). Figure 15(b) is a network model of all the 
possible connections between the towns. The vertices of the network represent the 
towns, the edges represent the existing roads, and the weight of each edge repre-
sents the cost (in millions of dollars) of creating a fiber-optic cable connection along 
that particular edge.
The problem facing the engineers and planners of the Amazonia Telephone 
Company is how to design a cable network that connects all the towns using the ex-
isting network of roads and that costs as little as possible to build—in other words, a 
minimum cost network. The first thing we can say about a minimum cost network is 
that it must be a spanning tree of the original network of roads shown in Fig. 15(a). 
(To connect all the towns means that the cable network must span all the vertices; 
to eliminate redundant connections means that it will have redundancy R = 0, and 
that means a tree.) But in this example there are costs involved, and not all span-
ning trees will have the same cost, so rather than finding any old spanning tree, we 
need to find the spanning tree with least total weight. We call such a spanning tree 
a minimum spanning tree.
One way to find a minimum spanning tree is to list all possible spanning trees, 
find the total cost of each, and pick the one with least cost. (This is the approach 
described as the brute-force algorithm.) The problem is that the network in Fig. 
15(b) has high redundancy (R = 6) and hundreds of possible spanning trees. Sifting 
through all of them to find the one with least cost is not a good plan. In Section 3 we 
will discuss a better way of finding a minimum spanning tree in the Amazon jungle.

Sometimes there is only one MST and we can refer to it as the MST, but we can’t 
assume this to be true in general. (For example, if all the weights in the network are 
the same, then every spanning tree is an MST.)
In most applications, the weights of the network represent costs—money, time, 
or distance. In these cases the goal is to minimize. There are some applications, how-
ever, where the weights represent profits. Profits (or other types of gains such as 
higher bandwidth on Internet connections or increased flows in pipelines) are things 
n minimum Spanning tree.  In a weighted network, a minimum spanning tree 
(MST) is a spanning tree with least total weight.
Example 9 was our introduction to the concept of a minimum spanning tree. We 
now give it a formal definition:
237

The Mathematics of Networks
we want more of, rather than less, so instead of minimizing we should be maximizing. 
This leads to our next definition.
n maximum Spanning tree. In a weighted network, a maximum spanning tree 
(MaxST) is a spanning tree with highest total weight.
Our next example illustrates a MaxST application.

thE amazoN max proFit NEtwork
This example is the flip side of Example 9. The problem is still to connect the seven 
towns in the Amazon jungle with a cable network, but the circumstances are quite 
different. Imagine that there are two parties involved: one party—say the govern-
ment—is paying for the construction costs of the cable network; the other party—
say the telephone company—is going to operate and run the network.
The government insists on building a network with zero redundancy (i.e., a 
spanning tree). Other than that, there are no restrictions on the choice of spanning 
tree (we assume that the cost of construction is the same no matter which spanning 
tree gets built, so to the paying party any spanning tree will do). On the other hand, 
to the telephone company the choice of spanning tree is very important—as is the 
case with any company, it wants to maximize profit, so building the most profitable 
spanning tree is the name of the game.
Let’s assume that the weight of each edge of the network in Fig. 16 represents 
the expected annual profits (in millions) to the phone company for operating that 
segment of the network. (You may have noticed that we are using exactly the same 
weighted network as that in Example 9. As you will see in the next section, this is 
not a coincidence.) To the phone company, the problem now becomes finding the 
MaxST of the original network. We will learn how to do this in the next section.

Kruskal’s Algorithm
3
Unlike the situation with TSPs there are several efficient and optimal algorithms for 
finding minimum spanning trees. Moreover, any algorithm that finds minimum span-
ning trees can be tweaked to find maximum spanning trees as well. In this section we 
will introduce one such algorithm—a simple algorithm called Kruskal’s algorithm after 
American mathematician Joseph Kruskal.
Kruskal’s algorithm is very similar to the cheapest-link algorithm used for solv-
ing TSPs. The minimum spanning tree gets built one edge at a time by choosing at 
each step the cheapest available edge. The only restriction in choosing the edges is 
that one should never choose an edge that creates a circuit. Having three or more 
edges coming out of a vertex, however, is now OK. Continue choosing edges this 
way until N - 1 edges are chosen. At that point one has an MST.
The following is a formal description of Kruskal’s algorithm. (For simplicity, we 
use “cheapest” to denote “of least weight.”)
kruSkal’S algorithm
n Step 1. Pick the cheapest edge available. (In case of a tie, pick one at random.) 
Mark it (say in red).
n Step 2. Pick the next cheapest edge available and mark it.
n Steps 3, 4, . . . , N  1. Continue picking and marking the cheapest unmarked 
edge available that does not create a circuit. After step N - 1 you are done.

n Step 2. The next cheapest edge available is BD at $45 million. We choose it for the 
MST and mark it in red.
n Step 3. The next cheapest edge available is AD at $49 million. Again, we choose it 
for the MST and mark it in red.
n Step 4. For the next cheapest edge there is a tie between AB and DG, both at $51 
million. But we can rule out AB—it would create a circuit in the MST, and we can’t 
have that! (For bookkeeping purposes it is a good idea to erase or cross out the 
edge.) The edge DG, on the other hand, is just fine, so we mark it in red and make 
it part of the MST.
Figure 17(c) shows how things look at this point.
n Step 5. The next cheapest edge available is CD at $53 million. No problems here, 
so again, we mark it in red and make it part of the MST.
n Step 6. The next cheapest edge available is BC at $55 million, but this edge would 
create a circuit, so we cross it out. The next possible choice is CF at $56 million, but 
once again, this choice creates a circuit so we must cross it out. The next possible 
choice is CE at $59 million, and this is one we do choose. We mark it in red and 
make it part of the MST.
n Step. . . . Wait a second—we are finished! Even without looking at a picture, we 
can tell we are done—six links is exactly what is needed for an MST on seven 
vertices.
Figure 17(d) shows the MST in red. The total cost of the network is $299 million.

 thE amazoNiaN cablE NEtwork aND kruSkal’S algorithm
In Example 9 we raised the following question: What is the optimal fiber-optic cable 
network connecting the seven towns shown in Fig. 17(a)? The weight of each edge is 
the cost (in millions of dollars) of laying the cable along that segment of the network.
The answer, as we now know, is to find the minimum spanning tree of the net-
work in Fig. 17(a). We will use Kruskal’s algorithm to do it. Here are the details:
n Step 1. We start by choosing the cheapest edge of the network. In this case we 
choose GF, and mark it in red (or any other color) as shown in Fig. 17(b). (Note 
that this does not have to be the first link actually built—we are putting the net-
work together on paper only. On the ground, the schedule of construction is a dif-
ferent story, and there are many other factors that need to be considered.)
Any algorithm that can find an MST can also be used to find a MaxST by means 
of a simple modification: Change the signs of the weights in the network. We call the 
network that we get when we change the signs of all the weights the negative of the

original network. Switching the signs of the weights switches MaxSTs into MSTs and 
vice versa. A MaxST of a network is an MST of the negative network. This follows 
from the simple fact that changing the signs of numbers reverses their inequality re-
lationships (74 7 45 implies that -74 6 -45). We will illustrate this idea by return-
ing to the MaxST problem introduced in Example 10.
ExamplE 13 
FiNDiNg mSts iN powEr griDS uSiNg kruSkal’S algorithm
In many rural areas electricity transmission lines are old. Old transmission lines 
carry lower voltages, leak more power, and are more sensitive to bad weather than 
modern transmission lines, so a common infrastructure project is to update the older 
parts of the grid with new transmission lines. The problem is how to choose the 
newer transmission lines so that they carry power to as many customers as possible

Figure 18(a) shows the negative network for the original network in Example 10 
(Fig. 16). We’ll use Kruskal’s algorithm to find the MST of this negative network. 
This will be the MaxST that we are looking for.

n Step 1. The cheapest edge in the negative network is AG, with a weight of -74. 
We choose it and mark it in red.
n Step 2. The next cheapest edge is CG, with a weight of -64. We choose it and 
mark it in red.
n Step 3. The next cheapest edge is EF, with a weight of -62. We choose it and mark 
it in red.
n Step 4. The next cheapest edge is CE, with a weight of -59. We choose it and mark 
it in red.
n Step 5. The next cheapest edge is CF, with a weight of -56. We choose it and . . . 
oops! Can’t do that. Choosing CF would create a red circuit. Spanning trees don’t 
have circuits. We rule out CF, and move on to the next cheapest edge, CB, with a 
weight of -55. No circuits with this one, so we choose it for the MST.
n Step 6. The next cheapest edge is CD, with a weight of -53. No problems here, so 
we choose it and mark it in red.
At Step 6 we are done! We have our MST for the negative network, shown in 
Fig. 18(b). This network is the MaxST we were looking for in the original network. The 
total profits that can be expected from this MaxST are given by the sum of the original 
weights: 74 + 64 + 62 + 59 + 55 + 53 = 367 million.

while at the same time keeping the cost of the project down. The least costly solution 
often involves finding an MST.
Figure 19(a) shows a section of the electrical power grid connecting 14 rural towns 
in central Texas. This is the network introduced in Example 3. The weight of each edge 
represents the length (in miles) of that particular segment of the grid. When the ter-
rain is flat—as is in central Texas—the cost of replacing a transmission line is propor-
tional to the length of the line (for high-voltage, modern transmission lines it is about 
$500,000 per mile), so when we minimize length we are also minimizing cost. It follows 
that the MST of the grid in Fig. 19(a) is going to give the cheapest spanning tree of 
updated power lines for the grid.
We’ll find the MST using Kruskal’s algorithm. [As a heads-up, we know ahead 
of time that in this network Kruskal’s algorithm will require 13 steps (the network 
has 14 vertices), so we’ll be brief and to the point.]
n Step 1. Choose LM (5) and mark it in red.
n Step 2. Choose AJ (11) and mark it in red.
n Step 3. Choose EF (11) and mark it in red.
n Step 4. Choose FG (12) and mark it in red.
n Step 5. Choose HM (13) and mark it in red.
n Step 6. Choose NK (14) and mark it in red.
n Step 7. Choose BK (16) and mark it in red.
n Step 8. Choose HN (18) and mark it in red.
n Step 9. Skip NL (21) because it closes a circuit. Choose AB (23) and mark it 
in red.
n Step 10. Choose DE (23) and mark it in red.
n Step 11. Choose CD (26) and mark it in red.
n Step 12. Choose FM (30) and mark it in red.
n Step 13. Skip CE (31), BC (31), and JK (32) because they all close circuits. Choose 
IN (32) and mark it in red. That’s it—we are done.
Figure 19(b) shows the MST. The total length of the MST is 232 miles. At an aver-
age cost of $500,000 per mile, the total cost of the infrastructure update is $117 million.

n network: a connected graph
n degree of separation: the length of the shortest path connecting two vertices of a 
network
n weighted network: a network with weights associated with the edges
n tree: a network with no circuits
n single-path property: in a tree there is one and only one path connecting any two 
vertices
n all-bridges property: in a tree all edges are bridges
n N  1 edges property: a tree with N vertices has N - 1 edges
n redundancy (R): in a network with N vertices and M edges R = M - (N - 1)
2 Spanning Trees, MSTs, and MaxSTs
n subtree: a set of vertices and edges in a network that form a tree
n spanning tree: a subtree whose vertices are all the vertices of the network
n minimum spanning tree (MST): in a weighted network, a spanning tree with small-

n maximum spanning tree (MaxST): in a weighted network, a spanning tree with 
largest total weight
A typical real-world network connects things (people, computers, cities, etc.) to 
each other, making possible the free flow of some commodity (communication,
information, electricity, etc.) between the different nodes of the network. From 
the perspective of the people being served by the network, the more connected 
the network is, the better—connections increase the ways the commodity can flow 
among the nodes, thus improving convenience, reliability, and performance. On the 
other hand, from the perspective of those planning or servicing the network, the 
less connected the network is, the better—connections can be expensive to build 
and maintain. As is usually the case, there are tradeoffs that must be made between 
convenience and cost. When convenience is important, or when costs are low, net-
works tend to be highly connected and have a lot of redundancy. When costs are 
high, convenience becomes less of a consideration and networks tend to have little 
or no redundancy.
In this chapter we discussed networks in general and some of the mathematical 
concepts associated with building good networks—redundancy, trees, spanning trees, 
weighted networks, MSTs, and MaxSTs. This was just a small peek into the mathematics 
of networks, a deep and important topic with obvious applications to our ever more con-
nected lives. If you don’t believe that, think about going without electricity or Internet 
access for a few days or even worse, imagine Facebook or Twitter being down—for just 
a day.

A through G. The weights of the edges represent the cost (in 
millions of dollars) of putting underground fiber-optic lines 
along the roads, and the MST of the network is shown in 
red. Figure 42(b) shows the same network except that one 
additional road (connecting E and G) has been added. Let x 
be the cost (in millions) of putting fiber-optic lines along this 
new road.

other algorithms for mSts and maxSts
Kruskal’s algorithm is not the only good algorithm for finding 
MSTs and MaxSTs in a weighted network—two other well-
known algorithms that are used to solve the same problem 
are Prim’s algorithm and Boruvka’s algorithm. Prepare a pre-
sentation on Prim’s and Boruvka’s algorithms. Describe both 
algorithms, and demonstrate how they work using one of the 
examples from the chapter. Compare Prim’s and Boruvka’s 
algorithms to Kruskal’s algorithm, and discuss their similarities 
and differences.

Dijkstra’s Shortest-path algorithm
In a network, there is at least one, but often many, paths con-
necting two vertices X and Y. When the network is an ordinary 
network, the “shortest path” between X and Y is defined as the 
path with the fewest number of edges (and the number of edges 
in a shortest path is called the degree of separation between X 
and Y). On the other hand, when the network is a weighted net-
work the “shortest path” between X and Y has a different defini-
 3 Social Networks and privacy
There is an inverse relation between connectedness and 
privacy. In general, the more connected you are the less  
privacy you have. The problem gets worse when it comes to 
proJEctS aND papErS
tion: Among all paths connecting X and Y, it is the path of least 
total weight.
Finding the shortest path between pairs of vertices in a 
weighted network is a problem that has many similarities to the 
problem of finding a minimum spanning tree of the network, and 
there is a nice algorithm that solves the problem optimally and 
efficiently. The algorithm, known as Dijkstra’s algorithm, is 
named after the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, who 
first proposed the algorithm in 1959. In this project you are asked 
to prepare a presentation on Dijkstra’s algorithm. At the very 
least you should carefully describe the algorithm, discuss some 
of its applications to real-world problems, and illustrate the algo-
rithm with a couple of examples. Dijkstra’s algorithm is a well-
known algorithm, and you will find plenty of resources for this 
project on the Web.
 49. Suppose that in a weighted network there is just one edge 
(call it XY) with the smallest weight. Explain why the edge 
XY must be in every MST of the network.
 50. Suppose that in a weighted network there is just one edge 
(call it XY) with the largest weight.
 
(a) Give an example of a network with more than one 
MST and such that XY must be in every MST.
 
(b) Give an example of a network with more than one 
MST and such that XY is in none of the MSTs.
 51. Suppose G is a disconnected graph with N vertices, M
edges, and no circuits.
 
(a) How many components does the graph have when 
N = 9 and M = 6?
 
(b) How many components does the graph have when 
N = 240 and M = 236? Explain your answer.
 52. Suppose G is a disconnected graph with no circuits. Let N 
denote the number of vertices, M the number of edges, and 
K the number of components. Explain why M = N - K. 
(Hint: Try Exercise 51 first.)

of spanning trees in a complete graph with N vertices is 
given by NN-2.

N * N * . . . * N, then we can compare the two factor by factor.
Each has (N - 2) factors, and each factor in (N - 1)! is  smaller 
than the corresponding factor in NN-2. Thus, for N Ú 3, 
(N - 1)! 6 NN-2.

The 
Mathematics 
of Scheduling
Chasing the Critical Path
Typically, it takes between four and nine months to build an 
average American home—rarely less than 120 days. But when 
a crowd of over 400 workers and volunteers got together the 
morning of October 1, 2005, in an empty lot in Tyler, Texas, they 
had a different idea in mind—the crazy thought that they would 
build a decent-sized, good quality house in less than three hours. 
Two hours and 52 minutes later—a world record—a 2249 square-
foot, 3-bedroom, 2-bath house with a two-car garage was 
standing in the middle of the lot and ready for occupancy.

ow was this tremendous feat of human ingenuity accomplished? Obvi-
ously, having hundreds of workers was essential to setting the record, but 
unleashing hordes of workers on a construction site is not enough—as a 
matter of fact, it is usually counterproductive. As is often said, too many cooks can spoil 
the broth. Most of the credit for the success of the project goes to what was accomplished 
before the physical work ever started: the creation of a seamless and critically coordi-
nated system of assignments that told every worker what to do and when to do it, so that 
not a single second would be wasted. In other words, the creation of a master schedule.
Building a house in world record time using hundreds of workers is an extreme 
example of something that we do more often than we realize: When facing a complex 
project, we break up the project into small tasks, and then plan and execute those in-
dividual tasks in a coordinated and organized way. We do this when we have to throw 
a party, repair a car, cook a fancy dinner, or write a book.
This chapter is about the coordination and organization part of the story, or, to 
put it more formally, about scheduling. The chapter starts with an introduction to 
the key elements in any scheduling problem—processors, tasks, processing times, 
and precedence relations (Section 1). Scheduling problems are best modeled using 
a special type of graph called a directed graph (or digraph for short)—we discuss 
digraphs and some of their basic properties in Section 2. In Section 3 we will discuss 
the general rules for creating schedules—the key concept here is that of a priority 
list. The two most commonly used algorithms for “solving” a scheduling problem are 
the decreasing-time and the critical-path algorithms—we discuss these in Sections 4 
and 5.
H
We knew this house 
would be built in world 
record time not by the 
best human effort, but 
only if we had a system 
in place. Clever people 
would not build it, 
although we had the most 
talented people on task; 
only a foolproof system 
would.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
An Introduction to Scheduling
1
We will now introduce the principal characters in any scheduling story.
n  The processors. Every job requires workers. We will 
use the term processors to describe the “workers” 
who carry out the work. While the word processor 
may sound cold and impersonal, it does underscore 
an important point: processors need not be human 
beings. In scheduling, a processor could just as well 
be a robot, a computer, an automated teller machine, 
and so on. We will use N to represent the number 
of processors and P1, P2, P3, . . . , PN to denote the 
processors. We will assume throughout the chapter 
that N Ú 2 (scheduling a job with just one processor 
is trivial and not very interesting).
n  The tasks. In every complex project there are indi-
vidual pieces of work, often called “jobs” or “tasks.” 
We will need to be a little more precise than that,
 
however. We will define a task as an indivisible unit of work that (either by na-
ture or by choice) cannot be broken up into smaller units. Thus, by definition a 
task cannot be shared—it is always carried out by a single processor. In general, 
we will use capital letters A, B, C, c, to represent the tasks, although in spe-
cific situations it is convenient to use abbreviations (such as WE for “wiring the 
electrical system” or PL for “plumbing”).
 
  At a particular moment in time a task can be in one of four possible states: 
(1) ineligible (the task cannot be started because some of the prerequisites for 
the task have not yet been completed), (2) ready (the task has not been started 
but could be started at this time), (3) in execution (the task is being carried out 
by one of the processors), or (4) completed.
n The processing times. The processing time of a task is the amount of time, with-
out interruption, required by one processor to execute that task. When dealing 
with human processors, there are many variables (ability, attitude, work ethic, 
etc.) that can affect the processing time of a task, and this adds another layer of 
complexity to an already complex situation. On the other hand, if we assume a 
“robotic” interpretation of the processors (either because they are indeed ma-
chines or because they are human beings trained to work in a very standardized 
and uniform way), then scheduling becomes somewhat more manageable.
 
  To keep things simple we will work under the following three assumptions:
  1. Versatility: Any processor can execute any task.
  2.  Uniformity: The processing time for a task is the same regardless of which 
processor is executing the task.
  3.  Persistence: Once a processor starts a task, it will complete it without inter-
ruption.
Under the preceding assumptions, the concept of processing time for a task 
(we will sometimes call it the P-time) makes good sense—and we can conve-
niently incorporate this information by including it inside parentheses next to 
the name of the task. Thus, the notation X152 tells us that the task called X has 
a processing time of 5 units (be it minutes, hours, days, or any other unit of time) 
regardless of which processor is assigned to execute the task.
n The precedence relations. Precedence relations are formal restrictions on the 
order in which the tasks can be executed, much like those course prerequi-
sites in the school catalog that tell you that you can’t take course Y until you 
    
BDR/Alamy

The Mathematics of Scheduling
have completed course X. In the case of tasks, these prerequisites are called 
precedence relations. A typical precedence relation is of the form task X precedes 
task Y (we also say X is precedent to Y), and it means that task Y cannot be started 
until task X has been completed. A precedence relation can be conveniently ab-
breviated by writing X S Y, or described graphically as shown in Fig. 1(a). A 
single scheduling problem can have hundreds or even thousands of precedence 
relations, each adding another restriction on the scheduler’s freedom.
 
  At the same time, it also happens fairly often that there are no restrictions 
on the order of execution between two tasks in a project. When a pair of tasks 
X and Y have no precedence requirements between them (neither X S Y nor 
Y S X), we say that the tasks are independent. 
When two tasks are independent, either one can be 
started before the other one, or they can both be 
started at the same time. Graphically, we can tell 
that two tasks are independent if there are no ar-
rows connecting them [Fig. 1(b)].
   Two final comments about precedence rela-
tions are in order. First, precedence relations are 
transitive: If X S Y and Y S Z, then it must be true 
that X S Z. In a sense, the last precedence relation 
is implied by the first two, and it is really unneces-
sary to mention it [Fig. 1(c)]. Thus, we will make a 
distinction between two types of precedence rela-
tions: basic and implicit. Basic precedence relations 
are the ones that come with the problem and that 
we must follow in the process of creating a sched-
ule. If we do this, the implicit precedence relations 
will be taken care of automatically.
 
  The second observation is that precedence relations cannot form a cycle! 
Imagine having to schedule the tasks shown in Fig. 1(d): X precedes Y, which 
precedes Z, which precedes W, which in turn precedes X. Clearly, this is logi-
cally impossible. From here on, we will always assume that there are no cycles 
of precedence relations among the tasks.

example 1  repairing a Wreck
Imagine that you just wrecked your car, but thank heavens you are OK, and the insur-
ance company will pick up the tab. You take the car to the best garage in town, operated 
by the Tappet brothers Click and Clack (we’ll just call them P1 and P2). The repairs 
on the car can be broken into four different tasks: (A) exterior body work (4 hours), 
(B) engine repairs (5 hours), (C) painting and exterior finish work (7 hours), and (D) 
Processors, tasks, processing times, and precedence relations are the basic ingre-
dients that make up a scheduling problem. They constitute, in a manner of speaking, 
the hand that is dealt to us. But how do we play such a hand? To get a small inkling 
of what’s to come, let’s look at the following simple example.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
transmission repair (3 hours). The only precedence relation for this set of tasks is that 
the painting and exterior finish work cannot be started until the exterior body work 
has been completed 1A S C2. The two brothers always work together on a 
repair project, but each takes on a different task (so they won’t argue 
with each other). Under these assumptions, how should the differ-
ent tasks be scheduled? Who should do what and when?
Even in this simple situation, there are many different 
ways to schedule the repair. Figure 2 shows several possible 
schedules, each one illustrated by means of a timeline. Figure 
2(a) shows a schedule that is very inefficient. All the short 
tasks are assigned to one processor 1P12 and all the long 
tasks to the other processor 1P22—obviously not a very clever 
strategy. Under this schedule, the project finishing time (the du-
ration of the project from the start of the first task to the comple-
tion of the last task) is 12 hours. (We will use Fin to denote the project 
finishing time, so for this project we can write Fin = 12 hours.)
Figure 2(b) shows what looks like a much better schedule, but it violates the 
precedence relation A S C (as much as we would love to, we cannot start task C 
until task A is completed). On the other hand, if we force P2 to be idle for one hour, 
waiting for the green light to start task C, we get a perfectly good schedule, shown in 
Fig. 2(c). Under this schedule the finishing time of the project is Fin = 11 hours.
Figure 2 (a) A legal schedule with Fin = 12 hours. (b) An illegal schedule (the precedence relation A S C is violated). 
(c) An optimal schedule (Opt = 11 hours). (d) A different optimal schedule.

The schedule shown in Fig. 2(c) is an improvement over the first schedule. Can 
we do even better? No! No matter how clever we are and no matter how many pro-
cessors we have at our disposal, the precedence relation A142 S C172 implies that 
11 hours is a minimum barrier that we cannot break—it takes 4 hours to complete A, 
7 hours to complete C, and we cannot start C until A is completed! Thus, the schedule 
shown in Fig. 2(c) is an optimal schedule and the finishing time of Fin = 11 hours 
is the optimal finishing time. (From now on we will use Opt instead of Fin when we 
are referring to the optimal finishing time.) Figure 2(d) shows a different optimal 
schedule with finishing time Opt = 11 hours.
As scheduling problems go, Example 1 was a fairly simple one. But even from 
this simple example, we can draw some useful lessons. First, notice that even though 
we had only four tasks and two processors, we were able to create several differ-
ent schedules. The four we looked at were just a sampler—there are other possible 
schedules that we didn’t bother to discuss. Imagine what would happen if we had 
hundreds of tasks and dozens of processors—the number of possible schedules to 
consider would be overwhelming. In looking for a good, or even an optimal, sched-
ule, we are going to need a systematic way to sort through the many possibilities. In 
other words, we are going to need some good scheduling algorithms.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
The second useful thing we learned in Example 1 is that when it comes to the 
finishing time of a project, there is an absolute minimum time that no schedule can 
break, no matter how good an algorithm we use or how many processors we put to 
work. In Example 1 this absolute minimum was 11 hours, and, as luck would have it, 
we easily found a schedule [actually two—Figs. 2(c) and (d)] with a finishing time to 
match it. Every project, no matter how simple or complicated, has such an absolute 
minimum (called the critical time) that depends on the processing times and pre-
cedence relations for the tasks and not on the number of processors used. We will 
return to the concept of critical time in Section 5.
To set the stage for a more formal discussion of scheduling algorithms, we will 
introduce the most important example of this chapter. While couched in what seems 
like science fiction terms, the situation it describes is not totally farfetched—in fact, 
this example is a simplified version of the types of scheduling problems faced by 
home builders in general.
example 2  Building ThaT dream home (in mars)
It is the year 2050, and several human colonies have already been established on 
Mars. Imagine that you accept a job offer to work in one of these colonies. What will 
you do about housing?
Like everyone else on Mars, you will be provided with a living pod called a Martian  
Habitat Unit (MHU). MHUs are shipped to Mars in the form of prefabricated kits 
that have to be assembled on the spot—an elaborate and unpleasant job if you are 
going to do it yourself. A better option is to use specialized “construction” robots that 
can do all the assembly tasks much more efficiently than human beings can. These 
construction robots can be rented by the hour at the local Rent-a-Robot outlet.
The assembly of an MHU consists of 15 separate tasks, and there are 17 differ-
ent precedence relations among these tasks that must be followed. The tasks, their 
respective processing times, and their precedent tasks are all shown in Table 1.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
Here are some of the questions we will address later in the chapter: How can 
you get your MHU built quickly? How many robots should you rent to do the job? 
How do you create a suitable work schedule that will get the job done? (A robot will 
do whatever it is told, but someone has to tell it what to do and when.)
Directed Graphs
2
A directed graph, or digraph for short, is a graph in which the edges have a direction 
associated with them, typically indicated by an arrowhead. Digraphs are particularly 
useful when we want to describe asymmetric relationships (X related to Y does not 
imply that Y must be related to X.
The classic example of an asymmetric relationship is romantic love: Just be-
cause X is in love with Y, there is no guarantee that Y reciprocates that love. Given 
two individuals X and Y and some asymmetric rela-
tionship (say love), we have four possible scenarios: 
Neither loves the other [Fig. 3(a)], X loves Y but Y 
does not love X [Fig. 3(b)], Y loves X but X does 
not love Y [Fig. 3(c)], and they love each other [Fig. 
3(d)].
To distinguish digraphs from ordinary graphs, we use slightly different termi-
nology.
n In a digraph, instead of talking about edges we talk about arcs. Every arc is 
defined by its starting vertex and its ending vertex, and we respect that order 
when we write the arc. Thus, if we write XY, we are describing the arc in Fig. 
3(b) as opposed to the arc YX shown in Fig. 3(c).
n A list of all the arcs in a digraph is called the arc-set of the digraph. The digraph 
in Fig. 3(d) has arc-set A = 5XY, YX6.
n If XY is an arc in the digraph, we say that vertex X is incident to vertex Y, or, 
equivalently, that Y is incident from X.
n The arc YZ is said to be adjacent to the arc XY if the starting point of YZ is the 
ending point of XY. (Essentially, this means one can go from X to Z by way of Y.)
n In a digraph, a path from vertex X to vertex W 1W  X2 consists of a sequence 
of arcs XY, YZ, ZU, c, VW such that each arc is adjacent to the one before it 
and no arc appears more than once in the sequence—it is essentially a trip from 
X to W along the arcs in the digraph. The best way to describe the path is by 
listing the vertices in the order of travel: X, Y, Z, and so on.
n When the path starts and ends at the same vertex, we call it a cycle of the di-
graph. Just like circuits in a regular graph, cycles in digraphs can be written in 
more than one way—the cycle X, Y, Z, X is the same as the cycles Y, Z, X, Y and 
Z, X, Y, Z.
n In a digraph, the notion of the degree of a vertex is replaced by the concepts of 
indegree and outdegree. The outdegree of X is the number of arcs that have X as 
their starting point (outgoing arcs); the indegree of X is the number of arcs that 
have X as their ending point (incoming arcs).
The following example illustrates some of the above concepts.

example 3  digraph Basics
The digraph in Fig. 4 has vertex-set V = 5A, B, C, D, E6 and arc-set A =
{AB, AC, BD, CA, CD, CE, EA, ED}. In this digraph, A is incident to B and C, but 
not to E. By the same token, A is incident from E as well as from C. The indegree of 
260

The Mathematics of Scheduling
vertex A is 2, and so is the outdegree. The indegree of vertex 
D is 3, and the outdegree is 0. We leave it to the reader to find 
the indegrees and outdegrees of each of the other vertices of 
the graph.
In this digraph, there are several paths from A to D, such 
as A, C, D; A, C, E, D; A, B, D; and even A, C, A, B, D. On 
the other hand, A, E, D is not a path from A to D (because you 
can’t travel directly from A to E). There are two cycles in this 
digraph: A, C, E, A (which can also be written as C, E, A, C and 
E, A, C, E) and A, C, A. Notice that there is no cycle passing 
through D because D has outdegree 0 and, thus, is a “dead-end,” and there is no cycle 
passing through B because from B you can only go to D, and once there you are stuck.

While love is not to be minimized as a subject of study, there are many other 
equally important applications of digraphs:
n The World Wide Web. The Web is a giant digraph, where the vertices are Web 
pages and an arc from X to Y indicates that there is a hyperlink (informally 
called a link) on Web page X that allows you to jump directly to Web page Y. 
Web linkages are asymmetric—there may be a link on X that sends you to Y but 
no link in Y that sends you to X.
n Traffic flow. In most cities some streets are one-way streets and others are two-
way streets. In this situation, digraphs allow us to visualize the flow of traffic 
through the city’s streets. The vertices are intersections, and the arcs represent 
one-way streets. (To represent a two-way street, we use two arcs, one for each 
direction.)
n Telephone traffic. To track and analyze the traffic of telephone calls through 
their network, telephone companies use “call digraphs.” In these digraphs the 
vertices are telephone numbers, and an arc from X to Y indicates that a call was 
initiated from telephone number X to telephone number Y.
n Tournaments. Digraphs are frequently used to describe certain types of tourna-
ments, with the vertices representing the teams (or individual players) and the 
arcs representing the outcomes of the games played in the tournament (the arc 
XY indicates that X defeated Y). Tournament digraphs can be used in any sport 
in which the games cannot end in a tie (basketball, tennis, etc.).
n organization charts. In any large organization (a corporation, the military, a 
university, etc.) it is important to have a well-defined chain of command. The 
best way to describe the chain of command is by means of a digraph often called 
an organization chart. In this digraph the vertices are the individuals in the orga-
nization, and an arc from X to Y indicates that X is Y’s immediate boss (i.e., Y 
takes orders directly from X).
As you probably guessed by now, digraphs are also used in scheduling. There 
is no better way to visualize the tasks, processing times, and precedence relations in 
a project than by means of a digraph in which the vertices represent the tasks (with 
their processing times indicated in parentheses) and the arcs represent the prece-
dence relations.
example 4  projecT digraph For The marTian home
Let’s return to the scheduling problem first discussed in Example 2. We can take 
the tasks and precedence relations given in Table 1 and create a digraph like 
the one shown in Fig. 5(a). It is helpful to try to place the vertices of the digraph

so that the arcs point from left to right, and this can usually be done with a little 
trial-and-error. After this is done, it is customary to add two fictitious tasks called 
START and END, where START indicates the imaginary task of getting the proj-
ect started (cutting the red ribbon, so to speak) and END indicates the imaginary 
task of declaring the project complete [Fig. 5(b)]. By giving these fictitious tasks 
zero processing time, we avoid affecting the time calculations for the project.
A diagraph having the tasks (and completion times) as vertices, the precedence 
relations as arcs, and with the fictitious tasks START (0) and END (0) representing 
the beginning and end of the project, respectively, is called a project digraph. The 
project digraph allows us to better visualize the execution of the project as a flow, 
moving from left to right.
Priority-List Scheduling
3
The project digraph is the basic graph model used to package all the information in 
a scheduling problem, but there is nothing in the project digraph itself that specifi-
cally tells us how to create a schedule. We are going to need something else, some 
set of instructions that indicates the order in which tasks should be executed. We can 
accomplish this by the simple act of prioritizing the tasks in some specified order, 
called a priority list.
A priority list is a list of all the tasks prioritized in the order we prefer to 
execute them. If task X is ahead of task Y in the priority list, then X gets priority 
over Y. This means that when it comes to a choice between the two, X is executed 
ahead of Y. However, if X is not yet ready for execution, then we skip over it and 
move on to the first ready task after X in the priority list. If there are no ready 
tasks after X in the priority list, the free processors must sit idle and wait until a 
task becomes ready.
The process of scheduling tasks using a priority list and following these basic 
rules is known as the priority-list model for scheduling. The priority-list model is 
a completely general model for scheduling—every priority list produces a sched-
ule, and any schedule can be created from some (usually more than one) “par-
ent” priority list. The trick is going to be to figure out which priority lists give 
us good schedules and which don’t. We will come back to this topic in Sections 
4 and 5.
Since each time we change the order of the tasks we get a different priority list, 
there are as many priority lists as there are ways to order the tasks. For three 
tasks, there are six possible priority lists; for 4 tasks, there are 24 priority lists; 
for 10 tasks, there are more than 3 million priority lists; and for 100 tasks, there are 
more priority lists than there are molecules in the universe.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
Clearly, a shortage of priority lists is not going to be our problem. If this sounds 
familiar, it’s because we have seen the idea before—priority lists are nothing more 
than permutations of the tasks. Like sequential coalitions and Hamilton circuits, the 
number of priority lists is given by a factorial.
Before we proceed, we will illustrate how the priority-list model for scheduling 
works with a few small but important examples. Even with such small examples, 
there is a lot to keep track of, and you are well advised to have pencil and paper in 
front of you as you follow the details.
numBer oF prioriTy lisTs
The number of possible priority lists in a project consisting of M tasks is 
M! = M * (M - 1) * g * 2 * 1
n For a review of permutations 
and factorials, see Section 4.
example 5  preparing For launch: parT 1
Immediately preceding the launch of a satellite into space, last-minute system 
checks need to be performed by the on-board computers, and it is important to 
complete these system checks as quickly as possible—for both cost and safety rea-
sons. Suppose that there are five system checks required: A162, B152, C172, D122, 
and E152, with the numbers in parentheses representing the hours it 
takes one computer to perform that system check. In addition, there 
are precedence relations: D cannot be started until both A and B 
have been finished, and E cannot be started until C has been finished. 
The project digraph is shown in Fig. 6.
Let’s assume that there are two identical computers on board (P1 
and P2) that will carry out the individual system checks. How do we 
use the priority-list model to create a schedule for these two processors?
For starters, we will need a priority list. Suppose that the priority 
list is given by listing the system checks in alphabetical order, and let’s follow the 
evolution of the project under the priority-list model.We will use T to indicate the 
elapsed time in hours. 
priority list: A162, B152, C172, D122, E152
n T  0 (sTarT). A162, B152, and C172 are the only ready tasks. Following the 
priority list, we assign A162 to P1 and B152 to P2.

a ready task (A and B have been completed). We assign D122 to P1.
n T  8. P1 has just completed D122; P2 is still busy with C172. There are no 
ready tasks at this time for P1, so P1 has to sit idle.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
The evolution of the entire project together with the project finishing time 
(Fin = 17) are captured in the timeline shown in Fig. 7. Is this a good schedule? 
Given the excessive amount of idle time (a total of 9 hours), one might suspect this 
is a rather bad schedule. How could we improve it? We might try changing the pri-
ority list.
n T  12. P1 is idle; P2 has just completed C172. Both processors are ready for 
work. E152 is the only ready task, so we assign E152 to P1, P2 sits idle. (Note 
that in this situation, we could have just as well assigned E152 to P2 and let P1 
sit idle. The processors don’t get tired and don’t care if they are working or idle, 
so the choice is random.)
n T  17 (end). P1 has just completed E152, and, therefore, the project is com-
pleted.
example 6  preparing For launch: parT 2
We are going to schedule the satellite launch 
system checks with the same two processors 
but with a different priority list. The project 
digraph is shown once again in Fig. 8. (When 
scheduling, it’s really useful to have the project  
digraph right in front of you.)
This time let’s try a reverse alphabetical 
order for the priority list. Why? Why not—at 
this point we are just shooting in the dark! (Don’t worry—we will become a lot more 
enlightened later in the chapter.)
priority list: E152, D122, C172, B152, A162
n T  0 (sTarT). C172, B152, and A162 are the only ready tasks. Following the

left, so P1 sits idle.

The timeline for this schedule is shown in Fig. 9. The project finishing time is

The Mathematics of Scheduling
Clearly, this schedule is a lot better than the one obtained in Example 5. In fact, 
we were pretty lucky—this schedule turns out to be an optimal schedule for two 
processors. [Two processors cannot finish this project in less than 13 hours because 
there is a total of 25 hours worth of work (the sum of all processing times), which im-
plies that in the best of cases it would take 12.5 hours to finish the project. But since 
the processing times are all whole numbers and tasks cannot be split, the finishing 
time cannot be less than 13 hours! Thus, Opt = 13 hours.]
Thirteen hours is still a long time for the computers to go over their system 
checks. Since that’s the best we can do with two computers, the only way to speed 
things up is to add a third computer to the “workforce.” Adding another computer 
to the satellite can be quite expensive, but perhaps it will speed things up enough to 
make it worth it. Let’s see.
example 7  preparing For launch: parT 3
We will now schedule the system checks using N = 3 computers 1P1, P2, 
P32. For the reader’s convenience the project digraph is shown again in 
Fig. 10. We will use the “good” priority list we found in Example 6.
priority list: E152, D122, C172, B152, A162
n  T  0 (sTarT). C172, B152, and A162 are the ready tasks. We assign 
C172 to P1, B152 to P2, and A162 to P3.
n T  5. P1 is busy with C172; P2 has just completed B152; and P3 is busy with 
A162. There are no available ready tasks for P2 [E152 can’t be started until 
C172 is done, and D122 can’t be started until A162 is done], so P2 sits idle until 
further notice.
n T  6. P3 has just completed A162; P2 is idle; and P1 is still busy with C172. 
D122 has just become a ready task. We randomly assign D122 to P2 and let P3 
be idle, since there are no other ready tasks. [Note that we could have just as 
well assigned D122 to P3 and let P2 be idle.]
n T  7. P1 has just completed C172 and E152 has just become a ready task, so we 
assign it to P1. There are no other tasks to assign, so P3 continues to sit idle.
n T  8. P2 has just completed D122. There are no other tasks to assign, so P2 and 
P3 both sit idle.
n T  12 (end). P1 has just completed the last task, E152, so the project is com-
pleted.
The timeline for this schedule is shown in Fig. 11. The project finishing time is 
Fin = 12 hours, a pathetically small improvement over the two-processor schedule 
found in Example 6. The cost of adding a third processor doesn’t seem to justify the 
benefit.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
The priority-list model
The previous three examples give us a general sense of how to create a schedule 
from a project digraph and a priority list. We will now formalize the ground rules of 
the priority-list model for scheduling.
At any particular moment in time throughout a project, a processor can be either 
busy or idle and a task can be ineligible, ready, in execution, or completed. Depending 
on the various combinations of these, there are three different scenarios to consider:
n All processors are busy. In this case, there is nothing we can do but wait.
n One processor is free. In this case, we scan the priority list from left to right, 
looking for the first ready task in the priority list and assign it to the free proces-
sor. (Remember that for a task to be ready, all the tasks that are precedent to 
it must have been completed.) If there are no ready tasks at that moment, the 
processor stays idle until things change.
n More than one processor is free. In this case, the first ready task on the priority 
list is given to one free processor, the second ready task is given to another free 
processor, and so on. If there are more free processors than ready tasks, some 
of the processors will remain idle until one or more tasks become ready. Since 
the processors are identical and tireless, the choice of which free processor is 
assigned which ready task is completely arbitrary.
It’s fair to say that the basic idea behind the priority-list model is not difficult, 
but there is a lot of bookkeeping involved, and that becomes critical when the num-
ber of tasks is large. At each stage of the schedule we need to keep track of the status 
of each task—which tasks are ready for processing, which tasks are in execution, 
which tasks have been completed, which tasks are still ineligible. One convenient 
recordkeeping strategy goes like this: On the priority list itself ready tasks are circled 
in red [Fig. 12(a)]. When a ready task is picked up by a processor and goes into  
execution, put a single red slash through the red circle [Fig. 12(b)]. When a task that 
has been in execution is completed, put a second red slash through 
the circle [Fig. 12(c)]. At this point, it is also important to check 
the project digraph to see if any new tasks have all of a sudden 
become eligible. Tasks that are ineligible remain unmarked [Fig. 
12(d)].
As they say, the devil is in the details, so a slightly more sub-
stantive example will help us put everything together—the project 
digraph, the priority list model, and the bookkeeping strategy.

This is the third act of the Martian Habitat Unit (MHU) building project. We are 
finally ready to start the project of assembling that MHU, and, like any good sched-
uler, we will first work the entire schedule out with pencil and paper. Let’s start with 
the assumption that maybe we can get by with just two robots (P1 and P2). For the 
reader’s convenience, the project digraph is shown again in Fig. 13.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
Let’s start with a random priority list.
priority list: AD182, AW162, AF152, IF152, AP172, IW172, ID152, IP142, PL142, 
PU132, HU142, IC112, PD132, EU122, FW162. (Ready tasks are circled in red.)
n T  0 (sTarT). Status of processors: P1 starts AD; P2 starts AW. We put a single 
red slash through AD and AW.
 
Priority list: AD, AW , AF , IF, AP, IW, ID, IP, PL, PU, HU, IC, PD, EU, FW.
n T  6. P1 busy (executing AD); P2 completed AW (put a second slash through 
AW) and starts AF (put a slash through AF).
 
Priority list: AD, AW , AF , IF, AP, IW, ID, IP, PL, PU, HU, IC, PD, EU, FW.
n T  8. P1 completed AD and starts AP; P2 is busy (executing AF).
 
Priority list: AD, AW , AF , IF, AP, IW, ID, IP, PL, PU, HU, IC, PD, EU, FW.
n T  11. P1 busy (executing AP); P2 completed AF, but since there are no ready 
tasks, it remains idle.
 
Priority list: AD, AW , AF , IF, AP, IW, ID, IP, PL, PU, HU, IC, PD, EU, FW.
n T  15. P1 completed AP. IF becomes a ready task and goes to P1; P2 stays idle.
 
Priority list: AD, AW , AF , IF, AP, IW, ID, IP, PL, PU, HU, IC, PD, EU, FW.
At this point, we will let you take over and finish the schedule. (Remember—
the object is to learn how to keep track of the status of each task, and the only way 
to do this is with practice.)
After a fair amount of work, we obtain the final schedule shown in Fig. 14, with 
project finishing time Fin = 44 hours.

Scheduling with priority lists is a two-part process: (1) choose a priority list and 
(2) use the priority list and the ground rules of the priority-list model to come up with 
a schedule (Fig. 15). As we saw in the previous example, the second part is long and 
tedious, but purely mechanical—it can be done by anyone (or anything) that is able to 
follow a set of instructions, be it a meticulous student or a properly programmed com-
puter. We will use the term scheduler to describe the entity (be it student or machine) 
that takes a priority list as input and produces the schedule as output.
Figure 15

Priority List
Ironically, it is the seemingly easiest part of this process—choosing a priority 
list—that is actually the most interesting. Among all the priority lists there is one 
(or more) that will give a schedule with the optimal finishing time. We will call these 
optimal priority lists. How do we find an optimal priority list? Short of that, how 
do we find “good” priority lists, that is, priority lists that give schedules with finish-
ing times reasonably close to the optimal? These are both important questions, and 
some answers are coming up next.
267

The Mathematics of Scheduling
When looking at the finishing time under the decreasing-time algorithm, one can’t 
help but feel disappointed. The sensible idea of prioritizing the longer jobs ahead of the 
shorter jobs turned out to be somewhat of a dud—at least in this example! What went 
wrong? If we work our way backward from the end, we can see that we made a bad 
choice at T = 33 hours. At this point there were three ready tasks [PD132, EU122, and 
IC112], and both processors were available. Based on the decreasing-time priority list, 
we chose the two “longer” tasks, PD132 and EU122, ahead of the short task, IC112. 
This was a bad move! IC112 is a much more critical task than the other two because we 
can’t start task FW162 until we finish task IC112. Had we looked ahead at some of the 
tasks for which PD, EU, and IC are precedent tasks, we might have noticed this.
The Decreasing-Time Algorithm
4
Our first attempt to find a good priority list is to formalize what is an intuitive and 
commonly used strategy: Do the longer jobs first and leave the shorter jobs for last. In 
terms of priority lists, this strategy is implemented by creating a priority list in which 
the tasks are listed in decreasing order of processing times—longest first, second 
longest next, and so on. (When there are two or more tasks with equal processing 
times, we order them randomly.)
A priority list in which the tasks are listed in decreasing order of processing times 
is called, not surprisingly, a decreasing-time priority list, and the process of creating a 
schedule using a decreasing-time priority list is called the decreasing-time algorithm.

Using the decreasing-time algorithm with N = 2 processors, we get the sched-
ule shown in Fig. 17, with project finishing time Fin = 42 hours. (Table 2 shows the 
details of how this schedule came about, but you may want to try re-creating the 
schedule on your own.)
Figure 16 shows, once again, the project digraph for the Martian Habitat Unit build-
ing project. To use the decreasing-time algorithm we first prioritize the 15 tasks in a 
decreasing-time priority list.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
An even more blatant example of the weakness of the decreasing-time algo-
rithm occurs at the very start of this schedule, when the algorithm fails to take into 
account that task AF152 should have a very high priority. Why? AF152 is one of 
the two tasks that must be finished before IF152 can be started, and IF152 must 
be finished before IW172 can be started, which must be finished before IP142 and 
ID152 can be started, and so on down the line.
Critical Paths and the Critical-Path Algorithm
5
When there is a long path of tasks in the project digraph, it seems clear that the first 
task along that path should be started as early as possible. This idea leads to the fol-
lowing informal rule: The greater the total amount of work that lies ahead of a task, 
the sooner that task should be started.
To formalize these ideas, we will introduce the concepts of critical paths and 
critical times.
n critical path (time) for a vertex. For a given vertex X of a project digraph, the 
critical path for X is the path from X to END with longest processing time. 
(The processing time of a path is defined to be the sum of the processing 
times of all the tasks along the path.) When we add the processing times of 
all the tasks along the critical path for a vertex X, we get the critical time for 
X. (By definition, the critical time of END is 0.)
n critical path (time) for a project. The path with longest processing time from 
START to END is called the critical path for the project, and the total pro-
cessing time for this critical path is called the critical time for the project.

example 10  criTical paThs in The marTian digraph
Figure 18 shows the project digraph for assembling the Martian Habitat Unit. We 
will find critical paths and critical times for several vertices of the project digraph.
n Let’s start with a relatively easy case—the vertex HU. A quick look at Fig. 18 
should convince you that there are only three paths from HU to END, namely,
1. HU, IC, FW, END, with processing time 4 + 1 + 6 = 11 hours,
2. HU, PD, END, with processing time 4 + 3 = 7 hours, and
3. HU, EU, END, with processing time 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
 
Of the three paths, (1) has the longest processing time, so HU, IC, FW, END is 
the critical path for vertex HU. The critical time for HU is 11 hours.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
We will soon discuss the special role that the critical time and the critical path 
play in scheduling, but before we do so, let’s address the issue of how to find critical 
paths. In a large project digraph there may be thousands of paths from START to 
END, and the “eyeballing” approach we used in Example 10 is not likely to work. 
What we need here is an efficient algorithm, and fortunately there is one—it is 
called the backflow algorithm.
n Next, let’s find the critical path for vertex AD. There is only one path from AD to 
END, namely AD, ID, PU, EU, END, which makes the decision especially easy. 
Since this is the only path, it is automatically the longest path and, therefore, the 
critical path for AD. The critical time for AD is 8 + 5 + 3 + 2 = 18 hours.
n To find the critical path for the project, we need to find the path from START 
to END with longest processing time. Since there are dozens of paths from 
START to END, let’s just eyeball the project digraph for a few seconds and 
take our best guess. . . .
n OK, if you guessed START, AP, IF, IW, IP, HU, IC, FW, END, you have good 
eyes. This is indeed the critical path. It follows that the critical time for the Mar-
tian Habitat Unit project is 34 hours.
 n step 1. Find the critical time for every vertex of the project digraph. This is 
done by starting at END and working backward toward START according 
to the following rule: The critical time for a task X equals the processing time 
of X plus the largest critical time among the vertices incident from X. The 
general idea is illustrated in Fig. 19. [To help with the recordkeeping, it is 
suggested that you write the critical time of the vertex in square brackets  
[ ] to distinguish it from the processing time in parentheses ( ).]
 n step 2. Once we have the critical time for every vertex in the project 
digraph, critical paths are found by just following the path along largest 
critical times. In other words, the critical path for any vertex X (and that 
includes START) is obtained by starting at X and moving to the adjacent 
vertex with largest critical time, and from there to the adjacent vertex with 
largest critical time, and so on.

We are now going to use the backflow algorithm to find the critical time for each of 
the vertices of the Martian Habitat Unit project digraph (Fig. 20).
271

The Mathematics of Scheduling
n step 1.
  Start at END. The critical time of END is 0, so we add a 304 next to END102.
  The backflow now moves to the three vertices that are incident to END, 
namely, FW162, PD132, and EU122. In each case the critical time is the 
processing time plus 0, so the critical times are FW364, PD334, and EU324. 
We add this information to the project digraph.
  From FW364, the backflow moves to IC112. The vertex IC112 is incident 
only to FW364, so the critical time for IC is 1 + 6 = 7. We add a 374 next to 
IC in the project digraph.
  The backflow now moves to HU142, PL142, and PU132. There are three 
vertices HU142 is incident to (IC374, PD334, and EU324). Of the three, 
the one with the largest critical time is IC374. This means that the critical 
time for HU is 4 + 7 = 11. PL142 is only incident to IC374, so its critical time 
is 4 + 7 = 11. PU132 is only incident to EU324, so its critical time is 3 + 2 = 5. 
Add 3114, 3114, and 354 next to HU, PL, and PU, respectively.
  The backflow now moves to IP142 and ID152. IP142 is incident to HU3114 
and PU354, so the critical time for IP is 4 + 11 = 15. ID152 is only incident 
to PU152, so its critical time is 5 + 5 = 10. We add 3154 next to IP, and 3104 
next to ID.
  The backflow now moves to IW172. The critical time for IW is 7 + 15 = 22. 
(Please verify that this is correct!)
  The backflow now moves to IF152. The critical time for IF is 5 + 22 = 27. 
(Ditto.)
  The backflow now moves to AP172, AF152, AW162, and AD182. Their 
respective critical times are 7 + 27 = 34, 5 + 27 = 32, 6 + 22 = 28, and 
8 + 10 = 18.
  Finally, the backflow reaches START(0). We still follow the same rule—the 
critical time is 0 + 34 = 34. This is the critical time for the project!
n step 2. The critical time for every vertex of the project digraph is shown in red 
numbers in Fig. 21. We can now find the critical path by following the trail of 
largest critical times: START, AP, IF, IW, IP, HU, IC, FW, END.

Why are the critical path and critical time of a project of special signifi-
cance? We saw earlier in the chapter that for every project there is a theoreti-
cal time barrier below which a project cannot be completed, regardless of how 
clever the scheduler is or how many processors are used. Well, guess what? This 
theoretical barrier is the project’s critical time.
If a project is to be completed in the optimal completion time, it is ab-
solutely essential that all the tasks in the critical path be done at the earliest 
possible time. Any delay in starting up one of the tasks in the critical path will 
necessarily delay the finishing time of the entire project. (By the way, this is why 
this path is called critical.)
Unfortunately, it is not always possible to schedule the tasks on the critical 
path one after the other, bang, bang, bang without delay. For one thing, processors

The Mathematics of Scheduling
are not always free when we need them. (Remember that a processor cannot stop 
in the middle of one task to start a new task.) Another reason is the problem of un-
completed precedent tasks. We cannot concern ourselves only with tasks along the 
critical path and disregard other tasks that might affect them through precedence 
relations. There is a whole web of interrelationships that we need to worry about. 
Optimal scheduling is extremely complex.
 n step 1: Find critical times. Using the backflow algorithm, find the critical time 
for every task in the project.
 n step 2: create priority list. Using the critical times obtained in Step 1, create 
a priority list with the tasks listed in decreasing order of critical times (i.e., a 
critical-time priority list).
 n step 3: create schedule. Using the critical-time priority list obtained in Step 
2, create the schedule.
criTical-paTh algoriThm
There are, of course, plenty of small details that need to be attended to when 
carrying out the critical-path algorithm, especially in Steps 1 and 3. Fortunately, 
everything that needs to be done we now know how to do.
example 12  The criTical-paTh algoriThm goes To mars
We will now describe the process for scheduling the assembly of the Martian Habi-
tat Unit using the critical-path algorithm and N = 2 processors.
We took care of Step 1 in Example 11. The critical times for each task are shown 
in red in Fig. 22.
Step 2 follows directly from Step 1. The critical-time priority list for the proj-
ect is AP3344, AF 3324, AW3284, IF 3274, IW3224, AD3184, IP3154, PL3114, 
HU3114, ID3104, IC374, FW364, PU354, PD334, EU324.
Step 3 is a lot of busywork—the details are left to the reader.

The critical-path algorithm
The concept of critical paths can be used to create very good (although not necessar-
ily optimal) schedules. The idea is to use critical times rather than processing times 
to prioritize the tasks. The priority list we obtain when we write the tasks in de-
creasing order of critical times (with ties broken randomly) is called the critical-time 
priority list, and the process of creating a schedule using the critical-time priority list 
is called the critical-path algorithm.
273

The Mathematics of Scheduling
The timeline for the resulting schedule is given in Fig. 23. The project finish-
ing time is Fin = 36 hours. This is a very good schedule, but it is not an optimal 
schedule. (Figure 24 shows the timeline for an optimal schedule with finishing time 
Opt = 35 hours.)

The critical-path algorithm is an excellent approximate algorithm for schedul-
ing a project, but as Example 12 shows, it does not always give an optimal schedule. 
In this regard, scheduling problems are like TSPs—there are efficient approximate 
algorithms for scheduling, but no efficient optimal algorithm is currently known. 
Of the standard scheduling algorithms, the critical-path algorithm is by far the 
most commonly used. Other, more sophisticated algorithms have been developed 
in the last 40 years, and under specialized circumstances they can outperform 
the critical-path algorithm, but as an all-purpose algorithm for scheduling, the  
critical-path algorithm is hard to beat.
Conclusion
In one form or another, the scheduling of human (and nonhuman) activity is a per-
vasive and fundamental problem of modern life. At its most informal, it is part and 
parcel of the way we organize our everyday living (so much so that we are often 
scheduling things without realizing we are doing so). In its more formal incarnation, 
the systematic scheduling of a set of activities for the purposes of saving either time 
or money is a critical issue in management science. Business, industry, government, 
education—wherever there is a big project, there is a schedule behind it.
By now, it should not surprise us that at their very core, scheduling problems 
are mathematical in nature and that the mathematics of scheduling can range from 
the simple to the extremely complex. In this chapter we focused on a very specific 
type of scheduling problem in which we are given a set of tasks, a set of precedence 
relations among the tasks, and a set of identical processors. The objective is to sched-
ule the tasks by properly assigning tasks to processors so that the project finishing 
time is as small as possible.

The Mathematics of Scheduling
To tackle these scheduling problems systematically, we first developed a graph 
model of the problem, called the project digraph, and a general framework by means 
of which we can create, compare, and analyze schedules, called the priority-list model. 
Within the priority-list model, many strategies can be followed (with each strategy 
leading to the creation of a specific priority list). In this chapter, we considered two 
basic strategies for creating schedules. The first was the decreasing-time algorithm, a 
strategy that intuitively makes a lot of sense but that in practice often results in inef-
ficient schedules. The second strategy, called the critical-path algorithm, is generally 
a big improvement over the decreasing-time algorithm, but it falls short of the ideal 
goal of guaranteeing an optimal schedule. The critical-path algorithm is by far the 
best known and most widely used algorithm for scheduling in business and industry.
Much like TSPs, scheduling problems are deceptively difficult. No optimal and 
efficient algorithm for scheduling is currently known, so when facing very large 
scheduling problems we must settle for suboptimal solutions.

 18. Wobble, a start-up company, is developing a search engine 
for the Web. Given a particular search word, say Angel-
face (the name of a rock band), Wobble’s strategy is to find 
all the Web sites containing the term Angelface, and then 
look at Web sites to which those Web sites link, to obtain 
a ranked list of search results. In other words, if there are 
lots of links pointing to Web site X from Web sites that 
mention Angelface, then it is likely that X contains lots of 
useful information about Angelface. In the digraph shown 
in Fig. 31, the vertices represent Web pages that contain 
the word Angelface and the arcs represent hyperlinks from 
one Web site to another.

 Worst-case analysis of scheduling 
algorithms
We saw in this chapter that when creating schedules there is a wide 
range of possibilities, from very bad schedules to optimal (best 
possible) schedules. Our focus was on creating good (if possible 
optimal) schedules, but the study of bad schedules is also of 
considerable importance in many applications. In the late 1960s 
and early 1970s, Ronald Graham of AT&T Bell Labs pioneered 
the study of worst-case scenarios in scheduling, a field known 
as worst-case analysis. As the name suggests, the issue in worst-
case analysis is to analyze how bad a schedule can get. This re-
search was motivated by a deadly serious question—how would 
the performance of the antiballistic missile defense system of the 
United States be affected by a failure in the computer programs 
that run the system?
In his research on worst-case analysis in scheduling,  
Graham made the critical discovery that there is a limit on how 
bad a schedule can be—no matter how stupidly a schedule is put 
together, the project finishing time Fin must satisfy the inequal-
ity Fin … Opt 12 - 1
N2, where N is the number of processors and 
Opt is the optimal completion time of the project.
Prepare a presentation explaining Graham’s worst-case 
analysis result and its implications. Give examples comparing 
optimal schedules and the worst possible schedules for projects 
involving N = 2 and N = 3 processors.

dijkstra’s shortest-path algorithm
Just as there are weighted graphs, there are also weighted digraphs. 
A weighted digraph is a digraph in which each arc has a weight (dis-
tance, cost, time) associated with it. Weighted digraphs are used to 
model many important optimization problems in vehicle routing, 
pipeline flows, and so on. (Note that a weighted digraph is not the 
same as a project digraph—in the project digraph the vertices rather 
than the edges are the ones that have weights.) A fundamental ques-
tion when working with weighted digraphs is finding the shortest 
path from a given vertex X to a given vertex Y. (Of course, there 
may be no path at all from X to Y, in which case the question is 
moot.) The classic algorithm for finding the shortest path between 
two vertices in a digraph is known as Dijkstra’s algorithm, named 
after the Dutch computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, who first pro-
posed the algorithm in 1959.
Prepare a presentation describing Dijkstra’s algorithm. 
Describe the algorithm carefully, and illustrate how the algorithm 
works with a couple of examples. Discuss why Dijkstra’s algo-
rithm is important. Is it efficient? Optimal? Discuss some pos-
sible applications of the algorithm.

Tournaments
In the language of graph theory, a tournament is a digraph whose 
underlying graph is a complete graph. In other words, to cre-
ate a tournament you can start with KN (the complete graph on 
N vertices) and then change each edge into an arc by putting 
an arbitrary direction on it. The reason these graphs are called 
tournaments is that they can be used to describe the results of 
a tournament in which every player plays against every other 
player (no ties allowed).
Write a paper on the mathematics of tournaments (as de-
fined previously).  You should touch on the connection between 
tournaments and the results of elections decided under the 
method of pairwise comparisons.

 (c)  The radio station is likely to be a major source of information 
on anything related to the concert (the band, where to buy tick-
ets, where to stay if you are from out of town, etc.), so it should 
be a vertex with high outdegree. V is the most likely choice.
 
 (d)  Z is a vertex linked to only the band’s Web site and to the ticket- 
selling Web site. None of the other Web sites are paying any 
attention to Z. This is most likely Joe Fan’s blog.
 
 (e)  The two sister hotels would clearly have links to each other’s 
Web sites, and since they are offering a special package for the 
concert, they are likely to have a link to the ticket-selling Web 
site. The logical choices are U and W.

Population

Models
There Is Strength in Numbers
There is a big clock—located inside the U.S. Department of  
Commerce Building in Washington, D.C.—that instead of keep-
ing time keeps the official count of the U.S. population. The United 
States Population Clock is really a digital display operated by 
the Census Bureau that shows a big number: the official resident 
population of the United States at the moment you are looking at 
it—citizens and noncitizens included. (A virtual version of the real 
clock can be found at www.census.gov/population/www
/popclockus.html.)

f you stare at the U.S. population clock for more than just a few seconds 
you will see the count go up by 1. What happened? Did some hospital 
call the Census Bureau with news that another baby had just been born? 
No. The ticking of the U.S. population clock is based on a mathematical model for 
the growth of the U.S. population. Like any other model, this is not intended to be 
a perfect representation of reality but just an approximation—that number on the 
clock is, in fact, almost certain to be wrong.
So, if the population figure in the clock is wrong, what is the clock good for? 
You’d be surprised. This is the remarkable thing about population models—they are 
incredibly useful (for the “big picture”) notwithstanding the fact that they are typically 
wrong (in the small details). In spite of their lack of accuracy, population models are 
successfully used by economists to make economic forecasts, by epidemiologists to 
project (and prepare for) epidemics, by urban planners to plan the future of cities, by 
demographers to develop population pyramids, by biologists to study animal popula-
tions, and so on.
In this chapter we will look at three different mathematical models of population 
growth. We start by introducing the concept of a number sequence followed by a brief 
general discussion of population sequences and the role they play in modeling popula-
tion growth (Section 1). In Section 2 we introduce the linear growth model and the con-
cept of an arithmetic sequence, we learn about 
an important formula called the arithmetic
sum formula, and we discuss several real-life
applications—including the Census Bureau model 
for the U.S. population—of linear growth. In 
Section 3 we introduce the exponential growth 
model and the concept of a geometric sequence, 
we learn about another important formula 
called the geometric sum formula, and we dis-
cuss examples of exponential growth in biologi-
cal populations. Finally, in Section 4 we intro-
duce the logistic growth model and the logistic 
equation, and we discuss examples of  logistic 
growth in animal populations.
I
Remember that all models 
are wrong; the practical 
question is how wrong do 
they have to be to not be 
useful.

Sequences
In mathematics the word sequence has a very specific meaning: A sequence is an 
infinite, ordered list of numbers. In principle, the numbers can be any type of num-
ber—positive, negative, zero, rational, or irrational. The individual numbers in a 
sequence are called the terms of the sequence.
The simplest way to describe a sequence is using a list format—start writing the 
terms of the sequence, in order, separated by commas. The list, however, is infinite, 
so at some point one has to stop writing. At that point, a “. . .” is added as a symbolic 
way of saying “and so on.” For lack of a better term, we will call this the infinite list 
description of the sequence.
How many terms should we write at the front end before we appeal to the “. . .”? 
This is a subjective decision, but the idea is to write enough terms so that a reasonable  
third party looking at the sequence can figure out how the sequence continues. No 
matter what we do, the “. . .” is always a leap of faith, and we should strive to make 
that leap as small as possible. Some sequences become clear with four or five terms, 
others take more.
Sequences and Population Sequences

ExamplE 1  How many TErmS arE EnougH?
n Consider the sequence that starts with 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . . . We could have 
continued writing down terms, but it seems reasonable to assume that at this 
point most people would agree that the sequence continues with 64, 128, . . . . 
The leap of faith here is small.
n  Consider the sequence that starts with 3, 5, 7, . . . . Are there enough terms here so 
that we can figure out what comes next? A good guess is that the sequence con-
tinues with 9, 11, 13, . . . but this is not the only reasonable guess. Perhaps the 
sequence is intending to describe the odd prime numbers, and in that case the 
next three terms of the sequence would be 11, 13, 17, . . . . We can conclude that 
3, 5, 7, . . . does not provide enough terms to draw a clear conclusion about the 
sequence and that a decent description should have included a few additional 
terms.
n Consider the sequence that starts with 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 
1113213211, 31131211131221, . . . . These are the first nine terms of the se-
quence—can you guess what the tenth term is? Even after nine terms, what 
comes next is far from obvious. (This sequence represents an interesting and 
challenging puzzle, and we leave it to the reader to try to find the next term and 
decipher the puzzle. Give it a try!)
The main lesson to be drawn from Example 1 is that describing a sequence us-
ing an infinite list is simple and convenient, but it doesn’t work all that well with 
the more exotic sequences. Are there other ways? Yes. Before we get to them, we 
introduce some useful notation for sequences.
n Sequence notation. A generic sequence can be written in infinite list form as
A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, . . .
The A is a variable representing a symbolic name for the sequence. Each term
of the sequence is described by the sequence name and a numerical subscript 
that represents the position of the term in the sequence. You may think of the 
subscript as the “address” of the term. This notation makes it possible to conve-
niently describe any term by its position in the sequence: A10 represents the 10th 
292

Population Growth Models  
term, A100 represents the 100th term, and AN represents a term in a generic posi-
tion N in the sequence.
The aforementioned notation makes it possible to describe some sequences 
by just giving an explicit formula for the generic Nth term of the sequence. That 
formula then is used with N = 1 for the first term, N = 2 for the second term, and 
so on.
ExamplE 2  SEquEncES DEScribED by a nicE Formula
Consider the sequence defined by the formula AN = 2N + 1. The first four terms of 
this sequence are
A1 = 21 + 1 = 3, A2 = 22 + 1 = 5, A3 = 23 + 1 = 9, and A4 = 24 + 1 = 17.
If we are interested in the 10th term, we just plug N = 10 into the formula and get 
A10 = 210 + 1 = 1025. If we are interested in the 100th term of the sequence we ap-
ply the formula once again and get A100 = 2100 + 1. Oops! What now? This is a huge 
number, and it may or may not be worth spelling it out in full. It is often the case that 
leaving the answer as A100 = 2100 + 1 makes more sense than writing down a 31-digit 
number, but if you really must have it, then here it is:
A100 = 1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,377.
ExamplE 3  SEquEncES DEScribED by a noT So nicE Formula
A very important and much-studied sequence is called the Fibonacci sequence, named 
after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Pisano, better known as Fibonacci (circa 
1175–1250). The next two examples give a brief introduction to the Fibonacci sequence.
There are several alternative formulas that can be used to define the Fibonacci 
sequence, and here is one of them (using F to represent the terms of the sequence):
n Fibonacci sequence (version 1): FN  ﬁa1  25
2
b
N
>25 ﬂ.
(Œ œ means round the number inside the brackets to the nearest integer).
To calculate the terms of this sequence using such a nasty formula is go-
ing to require at the very least a good calculator. You might want to confirm 
this with your own calculator or computer, but the first seven terms gener-
ated by the formula are as follows: F1 = Œ0.72 . . .œ = 1, F2 = Œ1.17 . . .œ = 1, 
F3 = Œ1.89 . . .œ = 2, F4 = Œ3.06 . . .œ = 3, F5 = Œ4.95 . . .œ = 5, F6 = Œ8.02 . . .œ = 8, and 
F7 = Œ12.98 . . .œ = 13. 
With this formula we don’t have to compute the terms in sequential order—if 
we want to (and with the right equipment), we can dive directly into deeper waters: 
F12 = Œ144.0013 . . .œ = 144; F25 = Œ75024.999 . . .œ = 75025, and so on.
Example 2 worked out well because the formula defining the sequence was fair-
ly simple. (Yes, the terms get very large, but that is a separate issue.) Unfortunately, 
as our next example shows, sometimes we will have to deal with sequences defined 
by some pretty complicated explicit formulas.
An alternative way to describe a sequence is to use a recursive formula. In con-
trast to an explicit formula, a recursive formula defines a term of a sequence us-
ing previous terms of the sequence. A recursive formula is not always possible, but 
when it is, it can provide a much nicer definition for a sequence than an explicit 
formula. A case in point is the Fibonacci sequence.
293

Population Growth Models  
ExamplE 4  rEcurSivE Formula For THE Fibonacci SEquEncE
The recursive formula for the Fibonacci sequence is surprisingly simple, especially 
when compared to the explicit formula given in Example 3. It is amazing that the 
two definitions describe the same sequence.
n Fibonacci sequence (version 2): FN = FN-1 + FN-2, and F1 = 1, F2 = 1.
The key part of the above formula is the recursive rule FN = FN-1 + FN-2. Stated 
in plain English, the rule says that each term of the sequence is obtained by adding its 
two preceding terms. Since this rule cannot be applied to the first two terms (neither 
has two preceding terms to work with), the first two terms must be given separately.
Applying the recursive formula requires us to find the terms of the sequence in 
order. The first two terms, F1 = 1, F2 = 1, are given in the definition. The next term 
comes from the recursive formula: F3 = F2 + F1 = 1 + 1 = 2. Another turn of the 
crank gives F4 = F3 + F2 = 2 + 1 = 3. Do it again, and we get F5 = F4 + F3 = 3 + 2 = 5. 
We can continue this way generating, in order, the terms of the sequence for as long 
as we want, and the beauty of it is that all we have to do to find each term is add the 
previous two numbers.
Here is the Fibonacci sequence written in infinite list form: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 
34, 55, 89, 144, 233, . . . .
Examples 3 and 4 illustrate the fact that the same sequence can be defined in 
two completely different ways. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, we saw first a 
definition based on a nasty looking explicit formula (version 1) and then a different 
definition based on a beautifully simple recursive formula (version 2). It is tempting 
to declare the latter version clearly superior to the first, but before we do so, there is 
one important detail to consider—with the recursive formula we cannot find a term 
of the sequence unless we know the terms that come before it. Think of comput-
ing a value of FN as analogous to getting to the peak of a mountain. The recursive 
formula is the mathematical version of climbing up to the peak one step at a time; 
the explicit formula is the mathematical version of being dropped at the peak by a 
helicopter.
As an example, consider the problem of finding the value of F100. To find this 
number using the recursive formula we will first have to find F99 and F98, and before 
we can find those values we will have to find and F97 and F96, and so on down the 
line. Each step of this journey is simple (add two numbers), but there are a lot of 
steps. In contrast, if we use the explicit formula we have to carry out one calcula-
tion—it is not an easy one, but it can be done with the right tools (a good scientific 
calculator or a computer program). Which is better? You decide.
population Sequences
For the rest of this chapter we will focus on special types of sequences called popula-
tion sequences. For starters, let’s clarify the meaning of the word population. In its 
original meaning, the word refers to human populations (the Latin root of the word 
is populus, which means “people”) but over time the scope of the word has been 
expanded to apply to many other “things”—animals, bacteria, viruses, Web sites, 
plastic bags, money, etc. The main characteristic shared by all these “things” is that 
their quantities change over time, and to track the ebb and flow of these changes we 
use a population sequence.
A population sequence describes the size of a population as it changes over 
time, measured in discrete time intervals. A population sequence starts with an 
initial population (you have to start somewhere), and it is customary to think of 
the start as time zero. The size of the population at time zero is the first term of the 
population sequence. After some time goes by (it may be years, hours, seconds, or 
even nanoseconds), there is a “change” in the population—up, down, or it may even 
stay unchanged. We call this change a transition, and the population after the first 
294
www.ebook3000.com

Population Growth Models  
transition is the first generation. The size of the first generation is the second term 
of the population sequence. After another transition the population is in its second 
generation, and the size of the second generation is given by the third term of the 
population sequence. The population sequence continues this way, each term de-
scribing the size of the population at a particular generation.
Notice that in the above description there is a slight mismatch between the gen-
erations and the terms of the population sequence: The first generation is repre-
sented by the second term of the sequence, the second generation by the third term, 
and so on. This is a little annoyance that can be fixed by starting the subscripts of 
the population sequence at N = 0. This means that for population sequences we will 
adopt a slightly different notation than the one we use with ordinary sequences.
n population sequence notation. A generic population sequence is described by
P0, P1, P2, P3, P4, . . .
 
where P0 is the size of the initial population, P1 is the size of the population in 
the first generation, P2 is the size of the population in the second generation, 
and so on (Fig. 1).
ExamplE 5  Fibonacci’S rabbiTS
More than eight centuries ago, in his seminal book Liber Abaci published in 1202, 
Fibonacci proposed the following population growth problem:
A man puts one pair of rabbits in a certain place entirely surrounded by a wall. 
How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year if the nature 
of these rabbits is such that every month each pair bears a new pair which from 
the second month on becomes productive?

A convenient way to visualize a population sequence is with a time-series graph. 
In a typical two-dimensional, time-series graph, the horizontal axis is used to rep-
resent time and the vertical axis is used to represent the size of the population. The 
terms of the sequence are represented by either isolated points, as in Fig. 2(a), or by 
points connected with lines, as in Fig. 2(b). The former is called a scatter plot, the 
latter a line graph.

Population Growth Models  
Fibonacci’s description of the problem can be restated into the following three 
facts: (1) each month, each pair (male/female) of mature (he called them produc-
tive) rabbits produces a pair of baby rabbits, (2) it takes one month for a pair of 
baby rabbits to become mature, and (3) the initial population consists of one pair 
(male/female) of baby rabbits.
We can use a population sequence to track the evolution of the rabbit popula-
tion over time. (Since everything is stated in terms of male/female pairs, we will let 
the terms of the sequence represent pairs of rabbits.)
n Start: P0 = 1. [The initial population has one pair (male/female) of baby rab-
bits.]
n Month 1: P1 = 1. [The starting pair becomes mature.]
n Month 2: P2 = 2. [The mature pair produces a baby pair. There are now two 
pairs—the original pair and their baby pair.]
n Month 3: P3 = 3. [The mature pair in month 2 produces another baby pair; the 
baby pair in month 2 becomes mature. There are now two mature pairs and one 
baby pair.]
n Month 4: P4 = 5. [Each of the two mature pairs in month 3 produces a baby pair; 
the baby pair in month 3 becomes mature. There are now three mature pairs 
and two baby pairs.]
We can keep going this way, but a better idea is to try to find a general rule that 
describes what is going on. In month N we have PN pairs—some are mature pairs 
and some are baby pairs. Because rabbits become mature the month after they are 
born, the number of mature pairs in month N equals the total number of pairs in 
month N - 1. This number is PN-1. Because every mature pair produces a baby pair 
the following month, the number of baby pairs in month N equals the number of 
mature pairs in month N - 1, which in turn equals the total number of pairs in month 
N - 2. This number is PN-2.
Figure 3 illustrates the generational changes for the first six generations. The 
blue arrows in the figure represent the fact that the number of baby pairs each month 
equals the number of mature pairs the previous month; the red arrows represent the 
fact that every pair of rabbits (baby or mature) is a mature pair one month later.

FigurE 3 Fibonacci’s rabbits: PN is the number of male/female pairs in the N th generation.
We now have a nice recursive formula for the rabbit population in month N: 
PN = PN-1 + PN-2, and starting terms P0 = 1, P1 = 1. We can use this formula to 
track the growth of the rabbit population over a 12-month period and answer  
Fibonacci’s original question (“how many pairs of rabbits . . . in a year?”):
P0 = 1, P1 = 1, P2 = 2, P3 = 3, P4 = 5, P5 = 8, P6 = 13,
 P7 = 21, P8 = 34, P9 = 55, P10 = 89, P11 = 144, P12 = 233.
There is an obvious connection between the population sequence describing 
the growth of the rabbit population in Example 5 and the Fibonacci sequence dis-
cussed in Example 4. Other than a change in notation (the F ’s changed to P’s and

the subscripts started at 0 instead of 1), they are the same 
sequence.
Fibonacci’s description of how his rabbit population 
would grow was an oversimplified mathematical model of 
how real-life rabbit populations live and breed. In real life, 
things are quite a bit more complicated: real rabbits are 
not monogamous, produce litters of varying sizes, die, and 
so on. We can’t capture all the variables that affect a rab-
bit population in a simple equation, and Fibonacci never 
intended to do that.
In practical terms, then, is there any value to sim-
plified mathematical models that attempt to describe the 
complex behavior of populations? The answer is Yes. We 
can make very good predictions about the ebb and flow of 
a population over time even when we don’t have a completely realistic set of rules 
describing the population’s behavior. Mathematical models that describe popula-
tion growth are based on a “big-picture” principle: Capture the variables that are 
really influential in determining how the population changes over time, put them 
into an equation (or several equations in the case of more complicated models) de-
scribing how these variables interact, and forget about the small details. In the next 
three sections we will put this idea into practice and explore three classic models 
of population “growth.” [A cautionary note on the terminology: When discussing 
populations, the word growth takes on a very general meaning—growth can be posi-
tive (the numbers go up), negative (the numbers go down), or zero (the numbers stay 
the same).]
A population grows according to a linear growth model if in each generation the 
population changes by a constant amount. When a population grows according to a 
linear growth model, that population grows linearly, and the population sequence 
is called an arithmetic sequence. Linear growth and arithmetic sequences go hand in 
hand, but they are not synonymous. Linear growth is a term we use to describe a spe-
cial type of population growth, while an arithmetic sequence is an abstract concept 
that describes a special type of number sequence.
Linear growth models occur mostly when studying inanimate populations—that is, 
populations of things that are not alive and, therefore, do not reproduce. Our first two 
examples are made-up, but describe typical real-life situations involving linear growth.

ExamplE 6  How mucH garbagE can wE TakE?
The city of Cleansburg is considering a new law that would restrict the monthly 
amount of garbage allowed to be dumped in the local landfill to a maximum of 120 
tons a month. There is a concern among local officials that unless this restriction on 
dumping is imposed, the landfill will reach its maximum capacity of 20,000 tons in a 
few years. Currently, there are 8000 tons of garbage in the landfill. Suppose the law 
is passed right now, and the landfill collects the maximum allowed (120 tons) of gar-
bage each month from here on. (a) How much garbage will there be in the landfill 
five years from now? (b) How long would it take the landfill to reach its maximum 
capacity of 20,000 tons?
We can answer these questions by modeling the amount of garbage in the land-
fill as a population that grows according to a linear growth model. A very simple way 
to think of the growth of the garbage population is the following: Start with an initial 
population of P0 = 8000 tons and each month add 120 tons to whatever the garbage 
population was in the previous month. This formulation gives the recursive formula 
PN = PN-1 + 120, with P0 = 8000 to get things started. Figure 4 illustrates the first

few terms of the population sequence based on the recursive formula. For the pur-
poses of answering the questions posed at the start of this example, the recursive 
formula is not particularly convenient. Five years, for example, equals 60 months, 
and we would prefer to find the value of P60 without having to compute the first 59 
terms in the sequence.

We can get a nice explicit formula for the growth of the garbage population 
 using a slightly different interpretation: In any given month N, the amount of gar-
bage in the landfill equals the original 8000 tons plus 120 tons for each month that has 
passed. This formulation gives the explicit formula PN = 8000 + 120 * N. Figure 5 
illustrates the growth of the population viewed in terms of the explicit formula.

ExamplE 7  nEgaTivE growTH anD DonuTS
Crunchy Donuts is a chain of donut stores. At the height of their popularity, Crunchy 
Donuts were the rage—people stood in line for hours (OK, maybe minutes) for a 
chance to bite into a warm Crunchy. But times have changed. Bad management and 
changes in people’s eating habits have forced Crunchy Donuts Corporation to start 
closing stores. On January 1, 2012 Crunchy Donuts had 1290 stores open for busi-
ness, but since then it has been closing stores at the rate of 60 stores a month. If they 
continue closing stores at this rate, how long will they stay in business? When will 
that very last Crunchy be consumed?
The explicit formula PN = 8000 + 120 * N will allow us to quickly answer the two 
questions raised at the start of the example. (a) After five years (60 months), the garbage 
population in the landfill is given by P60 = 8000 + 120 * 60 = 8000 + 7200 = 15,200. 
(b) If X represents the month the landfill reaches its maximum capacity of 20,000, 
then 20,000 = 8000 + 120X. Solving for X gives X = 100 months. The landfill will be 
maxed out 8 years and 4 months from now.
The line graph in Fig. 6 shows the projections for the garbage population in the 
landfill until the landfill reaches its maximum capacity. Not surprisingly, the line 
graph forms a straight line. This is always true in a linear growth model (and the 
reason for the name linear)—the growth of the population follows a straight line.
298

Population Growth Models  
We will model the number of Crunchy Donut stores still open as a population 
with the generations changing once a month—not exactly how things happen but a 
good approximation of reality. What makes this example different from Example 6  
is that here we have negative linear growth: The population is declining at a constant 
rate of 60 stores a month.
The simplest way to deal with negative linear growth is to let d be negative. 
Here d = -60, and the population “sequence” written in list form is
1290, 1230, 1170, 1110, . . . , ???
Here is the reason for the strange “???” at the end and for the word se-
quence being inside quotation marks: In this situation the list is not infinite—at 
some point the numbers will become negative, but a negative number of donut 
stores doesn’t make sense. In fact, what we really have here is a finite list that 
starts as an arithmetic sequence but stops right before the terms become nega-
tive numbers.
We can find the number of generations it takes before the terms become 
negative by setting the explicit formula for the Nth term of the sequence equal 
to 0 and then solving the equation for N. When N is not an integer (as is often 
the case) we round it down to the nearest integer. Here are the steps applied to 
our model:
 1. Explicit formula for the Nth term set equal to 0: PN = 1290 - 60N = 0.
 2. Solve above equation for N: 1290 = 60N 1 N =
1290
60 = 21.5.
 3. The last positive term of the population sequence is P21 = 1290 - 60 * 21 = 30.
P21 = 30 means that on October 1, 2013 (21 months after January 1, 2012) the 
model predicts that Crunchy Donuts will be down to 30 stores and sometime around 
the middle of October someone will be eating the last Crunchy ever. This is only a 
model, but it’s still sad to see them go.
We will now generalize the ideas introduced in Examples 6 and 7 and introduce 
some useful terminology.
n A population grows linearly (i.e., according to a linear growth model) if in each 
generation the population changes by a constant amount d. The constant d is 
called the common difference and the population sequence is an arithmetic se-
quence.
n When d is positive we have positive growth (i.e., the population is increasing); 
when d is negative we have negative growth (i.e., the population is decreasing); 
when d = 0 we have zero growth (i.e., the population stays constant).
n A population that grows linearly, with initial population P0 and common differ-
ence d, is described by the population sequence
P0, P0 + d, P0 + 2d, P0 + 3d, P0 + 4d, . . .
 
Since a population sequence cannot have negative terms, in the case of negative 
growth the “sequence” ends at the last positive term.
n An explicit formula for the Nth term of the population sequence is PN = P0 + Nd; 
a recursive formula for the Nth term of the population sequence 1N  02 is 
PN = PN-1 + d.
n The line graph describing a population that grows linearly is always a straight 
line. When d 7 0 the line graph has positive slope [Fig. 7(a)]; when d 6 0 the 
line graph has negative slope [Fig. 7(b)]; when d = 0 the line graph is horizontal 
[Fig. 7(c)].

Population Growth Models  
Our next example illustrates an important model of population growth. In this 
model the population grows on a straight line for a while, then the model is recali-
brated and the population grows on a different straight line, and so on. This type of 
growth is called piecewise linear.

ExamplE 8  a SHorT-TErm moDEl oF THE u.S. populaTion
The U.S. Census Bureau runs a virtual population clock that 
shows the official United States population at any moment in 
time. If you go right now to www.census.gov/population/www
/popclockus.html you can find out what the official United States 
population is at this moment. If you go back a minute later the 
numbers will have changed. Why and how did they change?
The ticking of the population clock is based on a mathe-
matical model for the growth of the U.S. population developed 
by the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau model is based on 
a combination of just three variables (the Census Bureau re-
fers to these as the component settings for the model): (1) the 
average frequency of births in the United States, (2) the aver-
age frequency of deaths in the United States, and (3) the av-
erage frequency of international net migration into the United 
States. These component settings are recalibrated each month 
to account for seasonal changes, but throughout each monthly period they remain 
constant. This means that the short-term (monthly) model of the U.S. population 
growth is a linear growth model, and a line graph showing the population growth 
throughout one month is a line segment. Figure 8(a) shows the line graph for the 
U.S. population from January 1 to February 1, 2012. It is a straight line. If we look at 
two consecutive months, the line graph consists of two separate line segments, but it 
need not be a straight line. Figure 8(b) shows the line graph for the U.S. population 
from September 1 to November 15, 2011. It looks almost like a straight line, but it 
isn’t—there is a change of slope at the start of each month.

Population Growth Models  
At the time of the writing of this example (January, 2012), the three compo-
nent settings for the month were (1) one birth every 8 seconds, (2) one death ev-
ery 12 seconds, and (3) one international migrant (net) every 45 seconds. These 
three numbers are combined into an average net gain of one person every 15.65 
seconds. [Here is how you get the 15.65 seconds (if you have the stomach to
deal with parts of a person): (1) one birth every 8 seconds is equivalent to 11>82th of 
a person born every  second, (2) one death every 12 seconds is equivalent to 11>122th 
of a person dying every second, and (3) one net migrant every 45 seconds is equiva-
lent to 11>452th of a person migrating into the United States every  second. The net 
result is that the U.S. population grows by 11>82 - 11>122 + 11>452  0.0639 parts 
of a person per second. This is equivalent to one person every 
1
0.0639  15.65 seconds.] 
This number stays constant throughout the month: One person gained every 15.65 
seconds means 230 persons added every hour, 5520 persons added each day, and a 
grand total gain of 171,120 persons for the month of January, 2012 [Fig. 8(a)].

ExamplE 9  rEDucing SinglE-uSE plaSTic bag conSumpTion
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, about 380 bil-
lion plastic bags are consumed each year in the United States. Of 
these, only about 1% are recycled—the remaining 99% end up in 
landfills or polluting waterways, rivers, and oceans. (Source: U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency, www.epa.gov.)
Of the 380 billion plastic bags consumed, an estimated 100 billion 
are single-use plastic bags of the type used at the grocery store for 
bagging groceries. The typical fate of a single-use plastic bag is to be 
neither reused nor recycled. As shopping consumers we can do some-
thing about this—take reusable cloth bags with us when we go grocery 
shopping. But how much of a dent can this minor change in grocery 
shopping habits make on the overall problem?
In the United States, on average, 450 single-use plastic grocery bags 
are consumed each year by each shopping adult in the population. Giv-
ing it a positive spin, for each shopping adult that stops using single-use plastic bags 
at the grocery store, 450 single-use plastic bags can be subtracted from the 100 billion 
consumed each year. That’s not much. But suppose that instead of thinking in terms 
of individuals we thought in terms of population percentages. There are roughly 210 
million shopping-age adults in the U.S. population. For each 1% of this population that 
stops using single-use plastic bags, 0.945 billion bags (i.e., 945 million) can be subtracted 
from the 100 billion consumed each year.
This gives us a realistic linear growth model for annual consumption of single-
use plastic bags: PN = 100 - 10.9452N, in which PN represents the annual number 
of single-use plastic bags consumed (in billions) and N represents the percent of the 
adult U.S. population that switches to the use of reusable cloth bags.
Figure 9 shows a line graph for this model. It shows that it is indeed possible to 
make a dent in the single-use plastic bag problem.

Population Growth Models  
The arithmetic Sum Formula
Suppose you are given an arithmetic sequence—say, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, . . .—and you are 
asked to add a few of its terms. How would you do it? When it’s just a very few, you 
would probably just add them term by term: 5 + 8 + 11 + 14 + g, but what if you 
were asked to add lots of terms—say the first 500 terms—of the sequence? Adding 500 
numbers, even with a calculator, does not seem like a very enticing idea. Fortunately, 
there is a nice trick that allows us to easily add any number of consecutive terms in any 
arithmetic sequence. Before giving the general formula, let’s see the trick in action.
ExamplE 11  THE coST oF builDing up invEnTory
Jane Doe Corporation, a small tractor manufacturer, has developed a radically new 
product: a driverless tractor that can be controlled remotely with a joystick by an op-
erator sitting in front of a console. The company can manufacture a maximum of 30 
tractors per week and wants to build up its inventory to meet the projected demand 
when the new tractor is unveiled. The plan is to go into an accelerated production 
schedule ahead of the product launch date. The company will produce 30 tractors 
ExamplE 10  aDDing THE FirST 500 TErmS oF 5, 8, 11, 14, . . .
Since a population sequence starts with P0, the first 500 terms are P0, P1, P2, . . . , P499. 
In the particular case of the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, . . . we have P0 = 5, d = 3, and 
P499 = 5 + 3 * 499 = 1502. The sum we want to find is
S = 5 + 8 + 11 + g+ 1496 + 1499 + 1502.
Now here comes the trick: (1) write the sum in the normal way, (2) below the first 
sum, write the sum again but do it backwards (and make sure the+signs are lined 
up), (3) add the columns, term by term. In our case, we get
 (1)  S =
5 +
8 +
11 + g+ 1496 + 1499 + 1502.
 (2)  S = 1502 + 1499 + 1496 + g+
11 +
8 +
5.
 (3)  2S = 1507 + 1507 + 1507 + g+ 1507 + 1507 + 1507.
The key is that what happened in (3) is no coincidence. In each column we get the 
same number: 1507 = 5 + 1502 = (starting term) + (ending term). Rewriting (3) as 
2S = 500 * 1507 and solving for S gives the sum we want: S =
1507 * 500
2
= 376,750.
We will now generalize the trick we used in the preceding example. In the 
solution S =
1507 * 500
2
 the 1507 represents the sum of the starting and ending terms, 
the 500 represents the number of terms being added, and the 2 is just a 2. The gen-
eralization of this observation gives the arithmetic sum formula.
If P0, P1, P2, . . . are the terms of an arithmetic sequence, then 
P0 + P1 + P2 + g+ PN-1 =
1P0 + PN-12N

.
ariTHmETic Sum Formula
Informally, the arithmetic sum formula says to find the sum of consecutive terms of 
an arithmetic sequence, first add the first and the last terms of the sum, multiply the 
result by the number of terms being added, and divide by two.
We will now see a practical application of the arithmetic sum formula.

Population Growth Models  
Sometimes the use of the arithmetic sum formula requires us to do a little detec-
tive work, as in the case where we are given just the first term and last term of the 
sum and the common difference d of the arithmetic sequence.
ExamplE 12  
14  13  22 + P  9222  ?
Suppose you are asked to add the terms of an arithmetic sequence with  common 
difference d = 9. The first term in the sum is 4; the last term is 922. To use the 
arithmetic sum formula we need to know how many terms we are adding. 
Call that number N. Then 922 = PN-1 (remember, we start at P0). On the oth-
er hand, the explicit formula for linear growth gives PN-1 = 4 + 91N - 12. 
 Combining the two gives 922 = 4 + 91N - 12 = 9N - 5 1 9N = 927 1 N = 103.
We now have what we need to use the arithmetic sum formula:

Table 1 shows the weekly storage cost starting at the end of week 1 (the start 
of storage) and ending at the end of week 72. The storage costs represent the first 
72 terms of an arithmetic sequence that starts with $300 and ends with $21,600. The

be paid to you one month from today, or  (2) you can have 1 penny today, 2 pennies 
tomorrow, 4 pennies the day after tomorrow, and so on—each day doubling your 
payoff from the day before—for a full month (say 31 days). Which of the two op-
tions would you choose? We’ll come back to this question later in the section, but 
you should make your choice now, and no cheating—once you make your choice 
you have to stay with it.
Before we start a full discussion of exponential growth, we need to spend a 
little time explaining the mathematical meaning of the term growth rate. In this 
chapter we will focus on growth rates as they apply to population models, but the 
concept applies to many other situations besides populations. 
When the size of a population “grows” from some value X to some new value 
Y, we want to describe the growth in relative terms, so that the growth in going from 
X = 2 to Y = 4 is the same as the growth in going from X = 50 to Y = 100.

n growth rate. The growth rate r of a population as it changes from an initial 
value X (the baseline) to a new value Y (the end-value) is given by the ratio 
 
r = Y - X
X
. (Note: It is customary to express growth rates in terms of percentages, 
so, as a final step, r is converted to a percent.)
One important thing to keep in mind about the definition of growth rate is 
that it is not symmetric—the growth rate when the baseline is X and the end-
value is Y is very different from the growth rate when the baseline is Y and the 
end-value is X.
We are finally ready to define exponential growth.
n A population grows exponentially if in each generation the population “grows” by 
the same constant factor R called the common ratio. In this case the population 
sequence takes the form
 
P0, P1 = RP0, P2 = R2P0, P3 = R3P0, P4 = R4P0, . . .

(Note the difference between linear and exponential growth: In linear growth 
we add a fixed constant, in exponential growth we multiply by a fixed constant.)

Table 2 shows the growth rates for several different 
baseline/end-value combinations. The first column of 
Table 2 shows the baseline population X, the second 
column shows the value for the new population Y, and 
the third column shows the computation of the growth 
rate r. All the computations except for (6) can and 
should be done without the use of a calculator.
Sometimes we are given the baseline X and the 
growth rate r and need to compute the end-value Y.
If we solve the equation r = Y - X
X
 for Y, we get
Y = rX + X = 1r + 12X. In this formula r must be in 
fractional or decimal form. Table 3 shows several ex-
amples of the computation of the end-value Y given 
the baseline X and the growth rate r.
The last variation of this theme is to compute the 
baseline X given the end-value Y and the growth rate
r. The formula for X in terms of Y and r is X =
Y
r + 1. It 
is just a twisted version of the formula Y = 1r + 12X.

Population Growth Models  
n An explicit formula for the Nth term of the population sequence given in equa-
tion (1) is PN = RNP0; a recursive formula for the Nth term of the population 
sequence 1N  02 is PN = RPN-1.
n Any numerical sequence in which a term is obtained by multiplying the preced-
ing term by the same constant R is called a geometric sequence. While geometric 
sequences in general can have negative terms (1, -2, 4, -8, . . . is a geometric se-
quence with R = -2), population sequences cannot have any negative terms. This 
implies that for population sequences we must include the assumption that R Ú 0.
n If a population sequence grows exponentially, the growth rate from one genera-
tion to the next is constant. If we call this constant growth rate r, we can describe 
the population sequence in a slightly different form:
P0, P1 = 11 + r2P0, P2 = 11 + r22P0, P3 = 11 + r23P0, P4 = 11 + r24P0, . . . 122
 
Equations (1) and (2) are two different versions of the same sequence connect-
ed by the relation R = 11 + r2. In other words, the common ratio equals one 
plus the growth rate.
n The relation R = 11 + r2 combined with the restriction R Ú 0 imposes a restric-
tion on the values of the growth rate: r Ú -1 (i.e., a population growth rate can-
not go below -1 = -100%). When R 7 1 the growth rate r is positive and the 
line-graph of the population sequence is increasing [Fig. 10(a)]; when 0 6 R 6 1 
the growth rate r is negative and the line-graph of the population sequence is 
decreasing [Fig. 10(b)]; when R = 1 the growth rate r is zero and the line-graph 
of the population sequence is horizontal [Fig. 10(c)]; and finally, R = 0 means 
r = -1 and a total collapse of the population—it becomes extinct after one gen-
eration [Fig. 10(d)]. (This last scenario is so unusual as to be practically impos-
sible, but in the next section we will see a model that makes the possibility of 
extinction much more realistic.)

  Exponential growth models are useful to describe the growth of living organ-
isms such as bacteria and viruses, the growth of human or animal populations 
under unrestricted breeding conditions, and even the growth of intellectual 
products such as e-mails, Web pages, and data sets. In all real-life applications,

exponential growth is assumed to occur only for a limited amount of time—
there is always a point at which exponential growth stops because the conditions 
that support the model can no longer be sustained. Our next example illustrates 
this point.
ExamplE 15  EraDicaTing THE gamma viruS inFEcTion
Thanks to a new vaccine and good public health policy, the number of reported 
cases of the Gamma virus infection has been dropping by 70% a year since 2010, 
when there were 1 million reported cases of the infection. If the present rate contin-
ues, how many reported cases of Gamma virus infection can we predict by the year 
2016? How long will it take to eradicate the virus?
In this example we are dealing with negative exponential growth. The growth 
rate is r = -70% = -0.7, and the common ratio is R = 1-0.7 = 0.3. The initial pop-
ulation is P0 = 1,000,000.
ExamplE 14  THE SprEaD oF an EpiDEmic
In their early stages, infectious diseases such as HIV or the 
swine flu spread following an exponential growth model—
each infected individual infects roughly the same number of 
healthy individuals over a given period of time. Formally, 
this translates into the recursive formula PN = (1 + r)PN-1 
where PN denotes the number of infected individuals in the 
population at time N and r denotes the growth rate of the 
infection.
Every epidemic starts with an original group of infected 
individuals called “population zero.” Let’s consider an epi-
demic in which “population zero” consists of just one infected 
individual 1P0 = 12 and such that, on average, each infected 
individual transmits the disease to one healthy individual each 
month. This means that every month the number of infected 
individuals doubles  and the growth rate is r = 1 = 100%. Un-
der this model the number of infected individuals N months 
after the start of the epidemic is given by PN = 2N.
Figure 11 shows the growth of the epidemic during its 
first year. By the end of the first year the number of infected 
individuals is P12 = 212 = 4096. That’s not too bad. But sup-
pose that no vaccines are found to slow down the epidemic 
and the growth rate for infected individuals continues at 
100% per month. At the end of the second year the number 
of infected individuals would equal P24 = 224 = 16,777,216. 
Eight months after that the number of infected individuals 
would equal P32 = 232  4.3 billion (more than half of the world’s population); one 
month later every person on the planet would be infected.
Example 14 illustrates what happens when exponential growth continues un-
checked, and why, when modeling epidemics, exponential growth is a realistic mod-
el for a while, but there must be a point in time where the rate of infection has to 
level off and the model must change. Otherwise, the human race would have been 
wiped out many times over.
Our next example shows the flip side of an epidemic—how vaccines and good 
public health policy help to eradicate a disease. Smallpox and polio are two exam-
ples of diseases that have been practically eradicated, but to keep things simple we 
will use a fictitious example.

The sequence 5, 15, 45, 135, . . . is a geometric sequence with R = 3. Let’s call S the 
sum of the first 20 terms of the sequence. Then,
 
S = 5 + 3 * 5 + 32 * 5 + 33 * 5 + g+ 319 * 5 
(1)
(The sum ends with the term 319 * 5 because it starts with 5 = 30 * 5.)
If we multiply both sides of equation (1) by R = 3 we get
 
3S = 3 * 5 + 32 *  5 + 33 * 5 + g+ 319 * 5 + 320 *  5 
(2)
If you compare the terms in equation (2) to those in equation (1) you can see most 
of them are the same. Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) gets rid of a lot of 
stuff (try it and you’ll see) and gives us equation (3):

According to the model, the number of cases of the Gamma virus in 2016 should 
be P6 = 1,000,000 * 10.326 = 729. By 2017 this number will drop to about 220 cases 
1729 * 0.3 = 218.72, by 2018 to about 66 cases, by 2019 to about 20 cases, and by 
2020 to 6 cases.
The story of the eradication of the Gamma virus is illustrated in Figure 12.
The geometric Sum Formula
Suppose you want to find the sum of the first 100 (or 1000) terms of a geometric 
sequence. Just as with arithmetic sequences, there is a handy formula that will allow 
us to do it without having to actually add the terms. We will call this formula the 
geometric sum formula. Here we will give the formula first and then explain how it 
can be derived.
(Note: The geometric sum formula works for all values of R with one important 
exception: When R = 1 the denominator on the right-hand side equals 0, and the 
formula does not work. When R = 1, however, no fancy formula is needed: Each 
term of the sum equals P0 and the sum equals NP0.)
The next example illustrates how the geometric sum formula can be derived us-
ing a trick analogous to the one we used to derive the arithmetic sum formula.

and P0 instead of 5 we get the general version of the geometric sum formula.
ExamplE 17  a monTH’S worTH oF Doubling pEnniES
We started this section with a unique proposition: (1) Take a lump payment of 
$100,000 one month from now, or (2) take 1 cent today, 2 cents tomorrow, 4 cents 
the next day, and so on for 31 days. Which one did you think was the better offer? If 
you chose (2) you were wise. After 31 days, you would have a grand total of
1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + g+ 230 cents.
This is a geometric sum with R = 2 and P0 = 1. Applying the geometric sum for-
mula gives 1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + g+ 230 = 231 - 1
2 - 1 = 231 - 1 =  2,147,483,647 cents. That’s 
$21,474,836 plus some spare change! (Yes, that’s right—$21 million plus!)
The geometric sum formula has many important and interesting applications to 
finance (amortizing loans, calculating the value of an annuity, etc.).
One of the key tenets of population biology is the idea that there is an inverse rela-
tion between the growth rate of a population and its density. Small populations have 
plenty of room to spread out and grow, and thus their growth rates tend to be high. 
As the population density increases, however, there is less room to grow and there 
is more competition for resources—the growth rate tends to taper off. Sometimes 
the population density is so high that resources become scarce or depleted, leading 
to negative population growth or even to extinction.
The effects of population density on growth rates were studied in the 1950s 
by behavioral psychologist John B. Calhoun. Calhoun’s now classic studies showed 
that when rats were placed in a closed environment, their behavior and growth rates 
were normal as long as the rats were not too crowded. When their environment be-
came too crowded, the rats started to exhibit abnormal behaviors, such as infertility 
and cannibalism, which effectively put a brake on the rats’ growth rate. In extreme 
cases, the entire rat population became extinct.
Calhoun’s experiments with rats are but one classic illustration of the general 
principle that a population’s growth rate is negatively impacted by the population’s 
density.
This principle is particularly important in cases in which the population is con-
fined to a limited environment. Population biologists call such an environment the 
habitat. The habitat might be a cage (as in Calhoun’s rat experiments), a lake (for a 
population of fish), a garden (for a population of snails), and, of course, Earth itself 
(everyone’s habitat).
In 1838, the Belgian mathematician Pierre François Verhulst proposed a 
mathematical model of population growth for species living within a fixed habitat.  
Verhulst called his model the logistic growth model.
The Logistic Growth Model

Population Growth Models  
The logistic growth model is based on two principles:
 1. Every biological population living in a confined habitat has a natural inter-
generational growth rate that we call the growth parameter of that population. The 
growth parameter of a population depends on the kind of species that makes up 
the population and the nature of its habitat—a population of beetles in a garden 
has a different growth parameter than a population of gorillas in the rainforest, 
and a population of gorillas in the rainforest has a different growth parameter than 
a population of gorillas in a zoo. Given a specific species and a specific habitat for 
that species, we will assume the growth parameter is a constant we will denote by r.
 2. The actual growth rate of a specific population living in a specific habitat depends 
not just on the growth parameter r (otherwise we would have an exponential 
growth model) but also on the amount of “elbow room” available for the popula-
tion to grow (a variable that changes from generation to generation). When the 
population is small (relative to the size of the habitat) and there is plenty of elbow 
room for the population to grow, the growth rate is roughly equal to the growth

We will now discuss how the two loosely stated principles above can be formal-
ized into a mathematical model. The first step is to quantify the concept of “elbow 
room” in a habitat. This can be done by introducing a related concept: the carrying 
capacity. For a given species and a given habitat, the carrying capacity C of a habi-
tat is the maximum number of individuals that the habitat can carry. Once we ac-
cept the idea that each habitat has a carrying capacity C for a particular population, 
we can quantify the amount of “elbow room” for that population as the difference 
1C - PN2 where PN is the size of the population in the Nth generation.
The simplest way to put populations, habitats, carrying capacity, and elbow 
room into a mathematical model is to combine the population size PN and the car-
rying capacity C into a single fraction pN =
PN
C , the p-value of the population. The
 p-value of a population represents the fraction (or percentage) of the carrying ca-
pacity that is occupied by that population and is analogous to the occupancy rate at 
a hotel. Using p-values makes things a lot easier. We don’t really worry about what 
the carrying capacity C of the habitat is—the p-value has already taken that into ac-
count: A p-value of 0.6 means that the population is occupying 60% of the carrying 
capacity of the habitat; a p-value of 1 means 100% occupancy of the habitat. Using 
p-values we can also express the relative elbow room for a population in its habitat: 
parameter r and the population grows more or less exponentially [Fig. 13(a)]. As 
the population gets bigger and there is less space for the population to grow, the 
growth rate gets proportionally smaller [Fig. 13(b)]. Sometimes there is a switch 
to negative growth, and the population starts decreasing for a few generations to 
get back to a more sustainable level [Fig. 13(c)].

Population Growth Models  
The relative elbow room for the Nth generation is 11 - pN2. [Think of 11 - pN2 
as the difference between 100% occupancy and the current occupancy rate at the 
Habitat Hotel.]
We are finally ready to put all of the aforementioned together. Everything will 
be expressed in terms of population p-values.
n In the Nth generation, the p-value of the population is pN and the amount of 
elbow room for that population is 11 - pN2.
n The growth rate of the population in going from the Nth generation to the next 
generation is proportional to the growth parameter r and the amount of elbow 
room 11 - pN2, i.e.,
growth rate for the Nth generation = r11 - pN2.
n In any given generation, the growth rate times the size of the population equals 
the size of the population in the next generation, i.e., 
pN+1 = r11 - pN2pN.
n logistic equation. The equation pN+1 = r11 - pN2pN is called the logistic equa-
tion. It gives a recursive formula for the growth of a population under the logis-
tic growth model. 
Using the logistic equation, we can analyze the behavior of any population liv-
ing in a fixed habitat. In the next few examples, we will explore the remarkable 
population patterns that can emerge from the logistic equation. All we will need for 
our “ecological experiments” is the value p0 of the starting population (this number 
is called the seed), the value of the growth parameter r, and a good calculator, or 
better yet, a spreadsheet. [A note of warning: all p-values are expressed as decimals 
between 0 (the population is extinct) and 1 (the population has completely filled up 
the habitat). The calculations were done in a computer and carried to 16 decimal 
places before being rounded off to 3 or 4 decimal places. You are encouraged to 
follow along with your own calculator, but don’t be surprised if the numbers don’t 
match exactly. Round-off errors are a way of life with the logistic equation.]
ExamplE 18  a STablE Equilibrium
Fish farming is big business these days, so you decide to give it a try. You have ac-
cess to a large, natural pond in which you plan to set up a rainbow trout hatchery. 
The carrying capacity of the pond is C = 10,000 fish, and the growth parameter of 
this type of rainbow trout is r = 2.5. We will use the logistic equation to model the 
growth of the fish population in your pond.
You start by seeding the pond with an initial population of 2000 rainbow trout 
(i.e., 20% of the pond’s carrying capacity, or p0 = 0.2). After the first year (trout 
have an annual hatching season) the population is given by
p1 = r11 - p02p0 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.22 * 10.22 = 0.4
The population of the pond has doubled, and things are looking good! Unfor-
tunately, most of the fish are small fry and not ready to be sent to market. After the 
second year the population of the pond is given by
p2 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.42 * 10.42 = 0.6
The population is no longer doubling, but the hatchery is still doing well. You 
are looking forward to even better yields after the third year. But on the third year 
you get a big surprise:
p3 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.62 * 10.62 = 0.6
Stubbornly, you wait for better luck the next year, but
p4 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.62 * 10.62 = 0.6

ExamplE 20  complEmEnTary SEEDS
In Example 19 we seeded the pond at 30% of its carrying capacity 1p0 = 0.32. If we 
seed the pond with the complementary seed p0 = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7, we end up with the 
same populations:
 p1 = 2.5 * 0.3 * 0.7 = 2.5 * 0.7 * 0.3 = 0.525
 p2 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.5252 * 10.5252  0.6234
and so on.
Example 20 points to a simple but useful general rule about logistic growth—the 
seeds p0 and 11 - p02 always produce the same population sequence. This follows 
because in the expression p1 = r11 - p02p0, p0 and 11 - p02 play interchangeable 
roles—if you change p0 to 11 - p02, then you are also changing 11 - p02 to p0. 
Nothing gained, nothing lost! Once the values match in the first generation, the rest 
of the p-values follow suit. The moral of this observation is that you should never 
seed your pond at higher than 50% of its carrying capacity.
ExamplE 19  an aTTracTing poinT
Consider the same setting as in Example 18 (same pond and the same variety of 
rainbow trout with r = 2.5), but suppose you initially seed the pond with 3000 rain-
bow trout (30% of the pond’s carrying capacity). How will the fish population grow 
if we start with p0 = 0.3?
The first six years of population growth are as follows:
 p1 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.32 * 10.32 = 0.525
 p2 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.5252 * 10.5252  0.6234
 p3 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.62342 * 10.62342  0.5869
 p4 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.58692 * 10.58692  0.6061
 p5 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.60612 * 10.60612  0.5968
 p6 = 2.5 * 11 - 0.59682 * 10.59682  0.6016
Clearly, something different is happening here. The trout population appears to 
be fluctuating—up, down, up again, back down—but always hovering near the value 
of 0.6. We leave it to the reader to verify that as one continues with the population  
sequence, the p-values inch closer and closer to 0.6 in an oscillating (up, down, up, 
down, c) manner. The value 0.6 is called an attracting point of the population sequence.

situation as one in which the population is at a stable equilibrium. Figure 14 shows a 
line graph of the pond’s fish population for the first four years.

You decided that farming rainbow trout is too difficult. You are moving on to rais-

Suppose you start by seeding a tank at 20% of its carrying capacity 1p0 = 0.22. 
The first 16 p-values of the goldfish population (for brevity, the details are left to 
the reader) are
p0 = 0.2, 
p1 = 0.496, 
p2  0.775,

An interesting pattern emerges here. 
After a few breeding seasons, the popula-
tion settles into a two-cycle pattern, alter-
nating between a high-population period 
at 0.765 and a low-population period at 
0.557. Figure 16 convincingly illustrates 
the oscillating nature of the population se-
quence.

You are now out of the fish-farming business and have acquired an interest in en-
tomology—the study of insects. Let’s apply the logistic growth model to study the 
population growth of a type of flour beetle with growth parameter r = 3.5. The seed 
will be p0 = 0.44. (There is no particular significance to the choice of the seed—you 
can change the seed and you will still get an interesting population sequence.)
Following are a few specially selected p-values. We leave it to the reader to 
verify these numbers and fill in the missing details.
p0 = 0.440, 
p1  0.862,

p25  0.875,

It took a while, but we can now see a pattern: Since p25 = p21, the population will 
repeat itself in a four-period cycle (p26 = p22, p27 = p23, p28 = p24, p29 = p25 = p21, 
etc.), an interesting and surprising turn of events. Figure 17 shows the line graph of 
the first 26 p -values.

Example 21 describes a situation not unusual in population biology—animal 
populations that alternate cyclically between two different levels of population den-
sity. Even more complex cyclical patterns are possible when we increase the growth 
parameter just a little.

The cyclical behavior exhibited in Example 22 is not unusual, and many insect 
populations follow cyclical patterns of various lengths—7-year locusts, 17-year cica-
das, and so on.
In the logistic growth model, the highest allowed value of the growth parameter 
r is r = 4. (For r 7 4 the p-values can fall outside the permissible range.) Our last 
example illustrates what happens when r = 4.

The surprise here is the absence of any predictable pattern. In fact, no matter 
how much further we continue computing p-values, we will find no pattern—to an 
outside observer the p-values for this population sequence appear to be quite erratic 
and seemingly random. Of course, we know better—they are all coming from the 
logistic equation.
The logistic growth model exhibits many interesting surprises. In addition to 
Exercises 57 through 62 you are encouraged to experiment on your own much like 
we did in the preceding examples: Choose a seed p0 between 0 and 0.5, choose an r 
between 3 and 4, and let her (the logistic equation) rip!
In this chapter we discussed three classic models of population growth. In the linear 
growth model, the population is described by an arithmetic sequence of the form
P0, P0 + d, P0 + 2d, P0 + 3d, c. In each transition period the population grows by 
the addition of a fixed amount d called the common difference. Linear growth is 
most common in situations in which there is no “breeding” such as populations of 
inanimate objects—commodities, resources, garbage, and so on.
In the exponential growth model, the population is described by a geometric 
sequence of the form P0, RP0, R2P0, R3P0, c. In each transition period the popu-
lation grows by multiplication by a positive constant R called the common ratio. 
Exponential growth is typical of situations in which there is some form of “breeding” 
Conclusion

Population Growth Models  
in the population and the amount of breeding is directly proportional to the size of 
the population.
In the logistic growth model populations are described in relative terms by the 
logistic equation pN+1 = r11 - pN2pN. This model is used to describe the growth 
of biological populations living in a fixed habitat and whose growth rates are in 
direct proportion to the amount of “elbow room” in the habitat. When confined 
to a single-species habitat, many animal populations grow according to the logistic 
growth model.

 1 The malthusian Doctrine
In 1798, Thomas Malthus wrote his famous Essay on the Prin-
ciple of Population. In this essay, Malthus put forth the prin-
ciple that population grows according to an exponential growth 
model, whereas food and resources grow according to a linear 
growth model. Based on this doctrine, Malthus predicted that 
humankind was doomed to a future where the supply of food 
and other resources would be unable to keep pace with the 
needs of the world’s population.
Write an analysis paper detailing some of the consequences 
of Malthus’s doctrine. Does the doctrine apply in a modern 
technological world? Can the doctrine be the explanation for 
the famines in sub-Saharan Africa? Discuss the many possible 
criticisms that can be leveled against Malthus’s doctrine. To what 
extent do you agree with Malthus’s doctrine?
 2  a logistic growth model for the united 
States population
The logistic growth model, first discovered by Verhulst, was 
rediscovered in 1920 by the American population ecologists 
Raymond Pearl and Lowell Reed. Pearl and Reed compared 
the population data for the United States between 1790 and 
1920 with what would be predicted using a logistic equation and 
found that the numbers produced by the equation and the real 
data matched quite well.
In this project, you are to read and analyze Pearl and Reed’s 
1920s paper. “On the Rate of Growth of the Population of the 
United States since 1790 and Its Mathematical Representation,” 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, 6 (June 
1920), 275–288. Here are some suggested questions you may 
want to discuss: Is the logistic model a good model to use with 
human populations? What might be a reasonable estimate for 
the carrying capacity of the United States?
 3 world population growth
How do demographers model world population? Is this different 
from how they model, say, the population of the United States? 
How does this process compare with that used by biologists in 
determining the size of a future salmon spawn?
In this project, you will compare and contrast the process 
demographers use to model human population growth with that 
which biologists use to model animal populations.

is obtained by calling out each number (as if you were reading it out to someone else). 
Calling out the last number “one three, two ones, one three, one one, one two, three ones, 
one three, one one, two twos, one one” gives the next number: 13211311123113112211.

Financial  
Mathematics
Money Matters
Sixty-four percent of Americans do not understand how compound 
interest works (TNS survey, 2008); less than a third of young adults 
possess basic knowledge of interest rates, inflation, and risk diver-
sification (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 2007–2008); 
82% of American college students with credit cards don’t pay their 
balance in full every month and pay finance charges (Sally Mae 
survey, 2009); 34% of Americans have no retirement savings; and 
27% have no personal savings (Harris Interactive Poll, 2010).
Every recent survey analyzing how much Americans know about 
financial matters, and how well they deal with their personal finances, 
points to the same answers: not very much and not very well.

”
– Niall Ferguson, 
The Ascent of Money
 
 hen it comes to money, you can run but you can’t hide. Willingly or not, 
you have to make financial decisions every day. Some are minor (“Should 
I get gas at the station on the right or make a U-turn and go to the station 
across the highway, where gas is 9 cents a gallon cheaper?); some are a little more 
challenging (“If I buy that new car, should I take the $2000 dealer rebate or the spe-
cial 1.2% financing offer for 60 months?”); and some have long-term consequences 
(“Should I invest in real estate or start a retirement savings account?”).
The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide you with a few tools needed 
for a basic understanding of financial mathematics. Reading this chapter is not go-
ing to turn you into a Warren Buffett, but it should help you better understand your 
financial options and stay away from common traps. Think of this chapter as a basic 
primer for survival in that jungle called the world of finance.
Percentages play an important role in financial mathematics, and this chapter 
starts with a thorough review of the meaning, use, and abuse of percentages (Sec-
tion 1). A second fundamental concept in financial mathematics is interest—the 
price one pays for using someone else’s money. In Section 2 we discuss simple inter-
est. Our discussion in this section includes investing in government and corporate 
bonds (sometimes a good idea) and borrowing 
money from payday loan companies (always a 
bad idea). In Section 3 we discuss compound 
interest. Our discussion in this section includes 
investments such as certificates of deposit and 
savings accounts. In Section 4 we focus on 
credit cards and installment loans—the two 
main generators of consumer debt in a modern 
economy.
One final note: Although this chapter has 
its share of formulas, the purpose of the chap-
ter is not to bury you with formulas. Formulas 
are unavoidable when you are doing financial 
mathematics, but not the end-all. The main goal 
of the chapter is to provide you with a few use-
ful tools that might get you started on the road 
to becoming a good money manager and a  
sophisticated consumer. And, if it helps you 
become rich some day, so much the better.

Financial Mathematics 
A general truism is that people don’t like dealing with 
fractions. There are exceptions, of course, but most peo-
ple would rather avoid fractions whenever possible. The 
most likely culprit for “fraction phobia” is the difficulty 
of dealing with fractions with different denominators. 
One way to get around this difficulty is to express frac-
tions using a common, standard denominator, and that 
denominator is 100. A “fraction” with denominator 100 
can be interpreted as a percentage, and the percentage 
symbol (%) is used to indicate the presence of the hid-
den denominator 100. Thus,
x% =
x
100
Percentages are used in several ways. (1) They serve 
as a common yardstick for comparing different ratios 
and proportions; (2) they provide a useful way of deal-
ing with fees, taxes, and tips; and (3) they help us better 
understand how things increase or decrease relative to 
some given baseline.

ExamplE 1 
Comparing TEsT sCorEs
Suppose that in your English Lit class you scored 19 out of 25 on the quiz, 49.2 out of 
60 on the midterm, and 124.8 out of 150 on the final exam. Without reading further, 
can you guess which one was your best score? Not easy, right?
The numbers 19, 49.2, and 124.8 are called raw scores. Since each raw score 
is based on a different total, it is hard to compare them directly, but we can do it 
easily once we express each score as a percentage of the total number of points 
possible.
n Quiz score = 19>25: Here we can do the arithmetic in our heads. If we just mul-
tiply both numerator and denominator by 4, we get 19>25 = 76>100 = 76%.
n Midterm score = 49.2>60: Here the arithmetic is a little harder, so one might 
want to use a calculator. 49.2 , 60 = 0.82 = 82%. (Since 0.82 = 82>100, 
it follows that 0.82 = 82%.) This score is a definite improvement over the quiz 
score.
n Final exam = 124.8>150: Once again, we use a calculator and get 124.8 , 150 =
0.832 = 83.2%. This score is the best one. Well done!
Example 1 illustrates the simple but important relation between decimals and 
percentages: decimals can be converted to percentages through multiplication by 
100, as in 
0.76 = 76%, 1.325 = 132.5%, and 0.005 = 0.5%.
Conversely, percentages can be converted to decimals through division by 100, 
as in 
100% = 1.0, 83.2% = 0.832, 71
2% = 0.075.

A note of caution: Later in the chapter we deal with very small percentages
such as 0.035%, 1
5%, and even 1
100%. In these cases there is a natural tendency to 
“lose” some zeroes along the way. Please be extra careful when converting very 
small percentages to decimals: 0.035% = 0.00035, 1
5% = 0.2% = 0.002, and 1
100% =
0.01% = 0.0001.
Our next two examples illustrate how we use percentages to deal with tips and 
taxes.
ExamplE 3 
shopping for an ipod
Imagine you have a little discretionary money saved up and you decide to buy your-
self the latest iPod. After a little research you find the following options:
n Option 1: You can buy the iPod at Optimal Buy, a local electronics store. 
The price is $299. There is an additional 6.75% sales tax. Your total cost out the 
door is
 $299 + 10.06752$299 = $299 + $20.1825
 = $319.18 1rounded to the nearest penny2
 
The above calculation can be shortened by observing that the original price 
1100%2 plus the sales tax 16.75%2 can be combined for a total of 106.75% of 
the original price. Thus, the entire calculation can be carried out by a single 
multiplication:
11.06752$299 = $319.18
n Option 2: At Hamiltonian Circuits, another local electronic store, the sales price 
is $312.99, but you happen to have a 5% off coupon good for all electronic prod-
ucts. Using the 5% off coupon, makes the price 95% of $312.99, or
10.952$312.99 = $297.34
ExamplE 2 
ThE 13,202 th rEsTauranT Tip
Imagine you take an old friend out to dinner at a nice restaurant for her 
birthday. The final bill comes to $56.80. Your friend suggests that since 
the service was good, you should tip 13>202th of the bill. What 
kind of tip is that?
After a moment’s thought, you realize that your friend, 
who can be a bit annoying at times, is simply suggesting you 
should tip the standard 15%. After all, 3>20 = 15>100 = 15%.
Although 3>20 and 15% are mathematically 
equivalent, the latter is a much more convenient 
and familiar way to express the amount of the tip. 
To compute the actual tip, you simply multiply 
the amount of the bill by 0.15. In this case we 
get 0.15 * $56.80 = $8.52. (People use various 
tricks to do this calculation in their heads. For 
an exact calculation you can first take 10% of the 
bill—in this case $5.68—and then add the other 
5% by computing half of the 10%—in this case 
$2.84. If you don’t want to worry about nickels and dimes you can just round the 
$5.68 to $6, add another $3 for the 5%, and make the tip $9.)

There is still the 6.75% sales tax that needs to be added, and as we saw in 
Option 1, the quick way to do so is to multiply by 1.0675. Thus, the final price 
out the door is
11.06752$297.34 = $317.41
 
 
For efficiency we can combine the two separate steps (take the discount and 
add the sales tax) into a single calculation:
11.06752 10.952$312.99 = $317.41
n Option 3: You found an online merchant in Portland, Oregon, that sells the iPod 
for $325, and the price includes a 5% shipping/processing charge that you don’t 
have to pay if you pick up the iPod at the store in Portland (there is no sales tax 
in Oregon). The $325 is higher than the price at either local store, but you are in 
luck: your best friend from Portland is coming to visit and can pick up the iPod 
for you and save you the 5% shipping/processing charge. What would your cost 
be then?
 
 
Unlike option 2, in this situation we do not take a 5% discount on the final 
price of $325. Here the 5% was added to the iPod’s baseline price to come up 
with the final cost of $325, that is, 105% of the baseline price equals $325. Using 
B for the unknown baseline price, we have
11.052B = $325, or B = $325
1.05 = $309.52
Although option 3 is your cheapest option, you decide it’s not worth imposing 
on your friend just to save a few bucks and head to Hamiltonian Circuits with your 
5% off coupon.
Our next example illustrates the use of percentages to describe relative increas-
es or decreases. Percentage increases and decreases are particularly useful when 
tracking the ebb and flow of some quantity over time such as following prices in the 
stock market.
ExamplE 4 
ThE dow JonEs indusTrial avEragE
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is one of the most 
commonly used indicators of the overall state of the stock 
market in the United States. (As of the writing of this material 
the DJIA hovered around 13,000.) We are going to illustrate 
the ups and downs of the DJIA with fictitious numbers.
n  Day 1: On a particular day, the DJIA closed at 12,875.
n  Day 2: The stock market has a good day and the DJIA closes 
at 13,029.50. This is an increase of 154.50 from the previous 
day. To express the increase as a percentage, we ask, 154.50 
is what percent of 12,875 (the day 1 value that serves as our 
baseline)? The answer is obtained by simply dividing 154.50 
by 12,875 (and then rewriting it as a percentage). Thus, the 
percentage increase from day 1 to day 2 is
 
154.50 , 12,875 = 0.012 = 1.2%

Here is a little shortcut for the same computation, particularly convenient when 
you use a calculator (all it takes is one division):
13,029.50 , 12,875 = 1.012
 
All we have to do now is to mentally subtract 1 from the above number. This 
gives us once again 0.012 = 1.2%.
n Day 3: The stock market has a pretty bad day and the DJIA closes at 
12,508.32. This represents a decrease from the previous day of 521.18. A 
better way to think of a decrease is as a negative increase, so we say that 
the “increase” from day 2 to day 3 was 12,508.32 - 13,029.50 = -521.18. 
Once again, this increase can be expressed as a percentage of the 13,029.50 
by dividing:
-521.18 , 13,029.50 = -0.04 = -4%
The following list summarizes the basic rules for working with percentages  
introduced in Examples 1 through 4.
 1. To express the ratio A>B as a percentage, write the ratio as a decimal (i.e., carry 
out the division A , B), and multiply by 100.
 2. To express P% as a decimal, divide P by 100. When P is itself given as a decimal, 
move the decimal point two places to the left.
 3. To find P% of B, multiply p times B (where p is P% expressed in decimal form).
 4. If you start with a baseline quantity B and add P% to it, you end up with a final 
value F that is 1100 + P2% of B. Using p again for the decimal form of P%, this 
can be expressed by the formula
F = 11 + p2B
  This formula is valid for both positive and negative values of p.
 5. Solving the formula F = 11 + p2B for B, gives the formula for finding the baseline 
  B when you know the final value F and the percentage increase p: B =
F
11 + p2.
 6. Solving the formula F = 11 + p2B for p, gives the formula for finding the 
percentage increase when you know the baseline B and the final value F: 
  p = 1 F
B2 - 1 = F - B
B . The percentage “increase” p can be positive, negative, or 
  zero. When p is positive we have a real increase 1F 7 B2; when p is negative we 
have a decrease 1F 6 B2; when p is zero we have no change 1F = B2.
Note: Please pay attention to the fact that the formulas given in 5 and 6 directly 
follow from solving the main formula F = 11 + p2B for B and p, respectively. You 
really only need to make one deposit to the memory bank.
percentage Traps
Although percentages are unquestionably useful, they can also be misinterpreted, 
misused, and manipulated. We will discuss a few of the misinterpretations, misuses, 
and manipulations next.
One of the most common ways people misinterpret percentages is by adding 
them. If you get a 15% raise one year and a 10% raise the next, your two raises 
combined come out to more than 25%. If your stock portfolio goes up 25% one day 
and goes down 20% the next day I have news for you—you didn’t make any money. 
If you go to a department store and a pair of shoes is marked down 20% and then 
there is an additional markdown of 30%, you are not getting the shoes at half-price. 
Our next example shows how these things happen.

ExamplE 7 
ThE 1% inCrEasE Trap
You just started a job as a sales rep with a major corporation. Your benefits pack-
age includes health insurance, and your contribution towards the health insurance 
premiums is 4% of your salary. Shortly after you start on the job you receive a 
memo from corporate headquarters announcing that due to rising health insurance 
premiums the employee contribution will have to increase, but that the increase is 
very small, just a 1% increase. Next month, when you look at your deductions, you 
notice that 5% of your salary is being deducted for your health insurance premium.
But jumping from 4% to 5% is not a 1% increase—it is really a 25% increase 
(never mind those % symbols—just consider the percentage increase when going 
from 4 to 5).
ExamplE 6 
ThE 200% disCounT Trap
A big electronics store is having a going-out-of-business sale and is advertising a 
200% discount on a 55-inch flat-screen TV. That sounds like quite a deal, so you 
decide to look into it. The TV was originally priced at $3600, and was now marked 
down to $1200. The salesman claims that reducing the price from $3600 to $1200, 
represents a 200% discount because $3600 is a 200% increase over $1200. The argu-
ment, of course, is completely backwards. The baseline for the decrease is $3600, the 
final value is $1200, and the percentage change is given by $ 
11200 - 36002
3600
 -0.6667. 
The correct discount is 66.67%.
Switching the roles of the baseline B and the final value F is a common trick, 
but here is something to keep in mind: if B and F are both positive, discounts max 
out at 100%. A discount of 100% means that the item is being given away for free, 
and a discount higher than 100% means that the store should be paying you to take 
the item.
The final percentage trap we will briefly discuss involves using percentages to 
compare percentages.
ExamplE 5 
Combining pErCEnTagEs
n A 15% raise followed by a 10% raise equals a 26.5% raise. Here is the explana-
tion: If your starting salary is $B, after a 15% raise your salary will be 11.152$B. 
After a second raise of 10%, your salary will be 11.12 11.152$B = 11.2652$B. 
This represents a 26.5% raise of your starting salary.
n If the value of your stock portfolio is $B, after a 25% increase it will be worth 
11.252$B. When you follow that with a 20% drop you have 10.82 11.252$B. But 
10.82 11.252 = 1, so when all is said and done you are breaking even.
n If the original price of a pair of shoes is $B, after a 20% markdown the 
price will be 10.82$B; after an additional 30% markdown the price will be 
10.72 10.82$B = 10.562$B. This represents a combined markdown of 44%.
The second trap with percentages involves the use and abuse of very large num-
bers. While percentages above 100% are not impossible, one should always be on the 
alert when large percentages (2000%, 300%, even a measly 110%) are being thrown 
around. When the coach says that he is happy because his players “gave 110%” he is 
just using a figure of speech. Nobody can give more than 100% effort, and even that 
is subject to question. 100% compared to what? Where is the baseline?
A very common misuse of large percentages occurs when stores overstate the 
discounts they are offering. This is illustrated in our next example.

The point of Example 7 is to illustrate the distinction between a 1% increase 
and an increase of one percentage point: 5% is one percentage point higher than 4%, 
but is 25% larger! Of course, the confusion between percentage points and percent 
increases can only come up when the quantities being discussed are percentages 
themselves.
We begin this section with a general discussion of interest—one of the fundamental 
concepts in finance.
interest
Interest is the price someone pays for the use of someone else’s money. You can 
think of interest as a rental cost, like the cost of renting a car or an apartment but 
applied to money. If you borrow money from a bank you must pay interest to the 
bank because you are renting their money; if you deposit money in a savings account 
the bank must pay interest to you because they are renting your money (so that they 
can turn around and rent it to someone else).
A more formal description of the concept of interest is as follows: If L (the 
lender) lends $P to B (the borrower), then eventually L expects to get more than $P 
back from B. [Note: this rule applies to business transactions—it does not (or should 
not) apply when L and B are friends or relatives.] If $F is the sum B eventually re-
pays L, then the interest is the difference between the principal and the repayment: 
I = F - P. That’s the easy version of the story. The devil is in the details, in particu-
lar, what are the rules that determine the value of I? This is the main topic we will 
cover in this and the next section.
The key variables involved in the computation of the interest on a loan are the 
principal P, the interest rate r, the term of the loan t, the repayment schedule and 
the type of interest used, in particular, whether the interest is simple or compounded. 
We will define these concepts next.
n principal (P ). This is the word used to describe the sum of money that the lender 
L lends the borrower B. (We will assume from here on that all sums of money 
are given in dollars, so the $ in front of a variable representing money will no 
longer be needed. When describing a specific sum of money, say $100, it is still 
important to use the $.)
n interest rate (r ). This is the rate paid by the borrower B to the lender L for 
the use of the principal P for a specific unit of time—usually a year. When 
the interest rate is expressed as a percentage of the principal, and the unit of time 
is a year, the rate is called an annual percentage rate (APR). The APR is the 
standard way that financial institutions describe the interest rates on their loans.
n Term (t ). The term (or life) of a loan is the length of time the borrower is bor-
rowing the money. Typically, the term of a loan is measured in either years or 
months, but weeks, days, etc. are also possible. (We will see an example of a 
very short-term loan later in this section.)
n repayment schedule. This is a schedule—agreed upon by lender and bor-
rower—for the repayment of the loan. In single payment loans the bor-
rower repays the loan in a single lump sum payment at the end of the term. 
In installment loans the borrower repays the loan by making equal monthly 
payments over the term of the loan. In credit card loans the repayment 
schedule is (up to a point) at the discretion of the borrower. We will discuss 
how different types of repayment schedules impact the interest on the loan 
in Section 4.
Simple Interest
2
333

Financial Mathematics 
n simple interest. When a loan is based on simple interest, the interest rate is 
applied only to the principal P. In this situation the interest paid on the loan per 
unit of time is constant (think of a rental where the rental cost is the same each 
time period). Since an early partial payment on a simple interest loan does not 
impact the total interest paid, the typical repayment schedule for a simple inter-
est loan is a single payment at the end of the loan. 
n Compound interest. When a loan is based on compound interest, the interest ac-
cumulates—first you pay interest on the principal, next you pay interest on the 
principal and the interest, and so on (think of a rental where the rental cost goes 
up each time period). For compound interest loans, making partial payments 
during the term of the loan reduces the total interest paid, and in many cases 
such as car loans and mortgage loans, monthly payments called installment pay-
ments are required by the lender. We will discuss auto loans and mortgage loans 
in Section 4.
For the rest of this section we will focus on loans and investments made under 
simple interest.
The simple interest formula
In simple interest, the cost of the loan is constant over time—the borrower pays the 
same amount of interest on each time period over the term of the loan. For simplic-
ity let’s assume the most common situation: the interest rate r is an APR expressed 
in decimal form. If P is the principal amount borrowed, the interest on the loan is 
rP per year over the term of the loan, so that if the term of the loan is t years, the 
total interest paid on the loan is I = trP. We call this the simple interest formula.
n simple interest formula. The total interest paid on a loan under simple in-
terest is I = trP, where P is the principal, r is the APR expressed as a dec-
imal, and t is the term of the loan in years. [An alternative version of the 
simple interest formula gives the future payoff F (principal plus interest): 
F = P + trP = P11 + tr2.]
ExamplE 8 
borrowing undEr simplE inTErEsT
Suppose you find a credit union that will give you a student loan under simple interest 
(this is quite unusual, as most lenders would much rather lend money under compound 
interest). The APR on the loan is 6%, 1r = 0.062, and the term of the loan is three 
years. Under these terms the credit union will lend you up to a maximum of $6000.
Let’s suppose that you are thinking about borrowing P = $5000. At the end of 
the three-year term 1t = 32 you will have to repay the credit union the original prin-
cipal of $5000 plus interest equal to I = 3 * 0.06 * $5000 = $900.
Now suppose that you decide you can afford to borrow a little more—just enough 
so that your interest at the end of the three-year term is $1000. How much should 
you borrow? Here you know the interest I, and the principal P is the unknown. The 
simple interest formula gives $1000 = 3 * 0.06 * P. Solving for P gives P = $5555.56.
A more interesting situation arises if you want to pay off the loan early. Sup-
pose that two and a half years after you take out the $5000 loan you come into some 
money and decide you want to pay the loan back. Can you compute the interest by 
plugging t = 2.5 into the simple interest formula? The answer depends on the fine 
print in your loan agreement. If the loan agreement allows you to pay off the loan 
before the end of the original term, then yes, the interest you will owe after 2.5 years 
is given by I = 2.5 * 0.06 * $5000 = $750, and your payoff will be F = $5750. A more 
likely scenario, however, is that your loan term is fixed at three years and whether 
you pay off the loan early or not the credit union will demand a payoff of $5900.

Financial Mathematics 
One of the lessons of Example 8 is that it is always a good idea to know all 
the details (not just the APR) of any loan agreement you sign. Fortunately, you 
don’t have to pore over the fine print on your own—the Consumer Credit Protec-
tion Act requires lenders to fully disclose, and in clear language, the terms of any 
loan agreement into which they enter. And if you have any questions, you should 
always ask.
bonds
Simple interest is also used on certain types of investment instruments, such as 
government and corporate bonds. Government agencies, including the United 
States government, states, cities, and municipalities issue bonds as a way to raise 
money. Private corporations do the same. When you buy a bond, you are essen-
tially lending your money to the agency issuing the bond. Bonds can be govern-
ment, muni, or corporate bonds, depending on whether the issuing agency is a 
government (state or federal), a municipality, or a corporation. The typical bond is 
defined by the term of the bond (3 years, 5 years, etc.), the APR, and the face value 
F of the bond. The face value (also called the par value), of a bond is the amount 
you get back from the issuing agency when the bond reaches maturity (i.e., at the 
end of the term).
ExamplE 9 
buying muniCipal bonds
Suppose you have the opportunity to buy a five-year municipal bond with a face 
value of $1000 and an APR of 3.25% 1r = 0.03252. What is the original price of the 
bond?
We can answer this question using the simple interest formula, but we 
have to be a little careful: the face value is the payoff F, so the formula that ap-
plies now is F = P + trP. The unknown in this case is the principal P, and solv-
ing for P gives P =
F
11 + tr2. In our example, F = $1000, t = 5 and r = 0.0325, so 
P =
1000
1 + 5 * 0.0325 =
1000
1.1625 = $860.22 (rounded to the nearest penny).
In the formula F = P + trP = 11 + tr2P, the face value and the principal are in 
direct proportion: If the principal on a bond with $1000 face value is P, the principal 
on the same bond with a different face value is proportional to P—the principal on a 
$5000 bond is 5P, the principal on a $2500 bond is 12.52P, and so on.
payday loans
A payday loan is a short-term loan in which a person can borrow a small sum (usu-
ally a maximum of $1000 or $1500) using a future paycheck as collateral. These loans 
usually have to be repaid when the borrower gets his next paycheck. The payday 
loan (also known as cash advance) business is big business, and in many neighbor-
hoods (especially poor neighborhoods) finding a payday loan company is easier 
than finding a grocery store.
There is sound logic behind the payday loan business: sometimes people are 
short on cash or have an emergency where they need quick access to money and 
don’t have the time or patience to go to a bank and apply for a conventional 
loan. Helping people out of temporary jams is a good thing to do, and in this 
sense, payday loan companies provide a good service. And, since payday loan 
companies operate with higher risk factors, it is reasonable and expected that 
they will charge higher interest rates than conventional banks. But how high is 
too high? Example 10 answers this question using data from a typical payday 
loan company.

Your best friend has put together a fantastic road trip for spring break. All you need 
is $400 for your share of the gas, food, lodging, and miscellaneous expenses. You 
really want to go, but you are totally broke, you have no savings, your credit card is 
maxed out, and your last semester grades were not so great, so asking your parents 
is out of the question.
You always wondered about that PayDay One branch in your neighborhood. 
[PayDay One is one of several dozen payday loan companies that operate across the 
United States, and relatively speaking, they have a decent reputation—they were 
ranked fourth among the top 10 payday lending companies in a 2012 online review 
(http://payday-loan-service-review.toptenreviews.com).] What would it take to get a 
quick $400 loan from them? You have that tax refund check coming soon that you 
can use as collateral, so you decide to check it out.
PayDay One charges $22.50 for every $100 lent. The term of the loan is 14 
days—you must pay back the principal plus interest in two weeks! The total interest 
on a $400 loan is I = 4 * $22.50 = $90. An interest charge of $90 on a $400 loan may 
not seem exorbitant, but let’s check out the APR on this loan. Solving the simple 
interest formula I = Prt for r gives r = I
Pt. In our example, I = $90 and P = $400. 
What about t? Since the interest rate is annual, we need to express the term of the 
loan in years: 14 days = 14
365 years means that t = 14

PayDay One’s APR of 586.61% on a 14-day loan is not unusual in the payday 
loan industry, where APRs range from 300% to as much as 650%. There has been 
a backlash against the types of interest rates charged by payday loan companies: 
17 states have banned payday loan companies from doing business; other states 
have passed “usury” laws that put a cap on the APRs that can be charged by lend-
ers in that state. Meanwhile, if you are ever in an emergency and need quick cash 
do whatever you can to find a better source of quick money than a payday loan 
company.
Under simple interest the interest rate is applied only to the principal. Under com-
pound interest, not only does the principal generate interest, so does the previously 
accumulated interest. All other things being equal, money invested under compound 
interest grows a lot faster than money invested under simple interest, and this differ-
ence gets magnified over time. If you are investing for the long haul (a college trust 
fund, a retirement account, etc.), always look for compound interest.

Here is an abbreviated timeline of the money in your trust fund account, starting  
with the day you were born:
n Day you were born: Uncle Nick opens the account with a $5000 deposit.
n First birthday: 6% interest is added to the account. Balance in account is 
11.062$5000. (We’ll leave the expression alone and do the arithmetic later.)
n Second birthday: 6% interest is added to the previous balance. Balance in 
account is 11.062 11.062$5000 = 11.0622 $5000.
n Third birthday: 6% interest is added to the previous balance. Balance in account 
is 11.062 11.0622 $5000 = 11.0623 $5000.
At this point you might have noticed that the exponent of (1.06) in the calcula-
tion of the account balance goes up by 1 on each birthday and, in fact, matches the 
birthday. Thus,
n Eighteenth birthday: The balance in the account is 11.06218 $5000. It is finally 
time to pull out a calculator and do the computation:
11.06218 $5000 = $14,271.70 (rounded to the nearest penny2
n Today: Remember—right now you are supposed to be 18 years and 10 
months old. Since the bank only credits interest to your trust fund account 
once a year and you haven’t turned 19 yet, the balance in the account is still 
$14,271.70.
n Nineteenth birthday: The future value of the account on your nineteenth birth-
day will be
11.06219 $5000 = $15,128 (rounded to the nearest penny2
 
Moving further along into the future, we have
n Sixtieth birthday: The future value of the trust fund account is
11.06260  $5000 = $164,938.45
 
which is an amazing return for a $5000 investment (if you are willing to wait, of 
course)!

fuTurE valuE of a Cd undEr annual Compounding
Suppose you invest $1500 on a CD with an APR of 4.8% compounded annually. 
Let t denote the length (in years) of the CD’s term. Using the annual compounding 
formula with P = $1500 and r = 0.048 gives the future value F of the CD when it 
matures in t years: F = $150011.0482t. Table 1 shows the values of F corresponding 
to 1-, 2-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year CDs.

An interesting fact to observe in Table 1 is that the 15-year CD roughly doubles the 
original $1500 investment. There is a general rule of thumb, called the rule of 72, 
that estimates how many years it takes to double an original investment under an-
nual compounding. The rule of 72 is independent of the principal and only depends 
on the APR.
We can generalize the computation used in Example 11 to any principal P, any 
APR r, and any term t given in whole number of years (when the term is not a whole 
number we need to round it down, since a fraction of a year won’t generate any 
interest).
n annual Compounding formula. The future value F of P dollars compounded 
annually for t years with an APR r is F = P11 + r2t.
Certificates of deposit
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of investment that is a hybrid between an 
ordinary savings account and a bond. Much like a bond, when you buy a CD you 
are lending your money—in this case to a bank or credit union—for a fixed term 
and at a fixed APR. Unlike a bond, however, the interest on a CD is compounded, 
usually on an annual basis, but semi-annual or monthly compounding are also 
possible.
Like an ordinary savings account, a CD is an extremely safe investment (CDs 
issued by a federally insured bank or credit union are guaranteed by the govern-
ment), and it usually offers a much higher rate of return. Unlike a savings account, 
however, the money in a CD is pretty much locked up for the term of the CD—if 
you want to take your money out before the CD matures, you have to pay a pretty 
steep early withdrawal penalty. At the end of the CD’s term you have to cash out, 
although you always have the option to roll the money over to a new CD (with new 
terms and a new APR). The cash value of the CD at the end of its term is referred 
to as the future value.
Our next four examples illustrate the effect that compounding has on the future 
value of a CD.

n rule of 72. To estimate how long it takes (in years) to double an investment 
under annual compounding, take the number 72 and divide it by the APR (here 
you use the percentage value of the APR).
If we apply the rule of 72 to an APR of 4.8% we get a doubling time of 
72 , 4.8 = 15 years. Compare this result with the last row of Table 1. That’s amaz-
ingly accurate! (OK, time to fess up—using an APR of 4.8% is stacking the deck in 
favor of the rule of 72 because, unlike most APRs, 4.8 divides evenly into 72.)
For a more typical use of the rule of 72 consider a CD compounded annually 
with a 7% APR. The rule of 72 gives an estimate of 72 , 7 = 10.2857. . . years for 
the doubling time. We interpret this to mean that 10 years is not quite long enough 
to double our money and 11 years is plenty long.
general Compounding
Every so often, one can find a bank or credit union that offers CDs compounded 
more than once a year—twice a year (semi-annually), four times a year (quarterly), 
even 12 times a year (monthly). In the case of savings accounts, there is daily com-
pounding and even continuous compounding. The more frequent the compounding 
the better it is for the investor as more and more interest accumulates on the prin-
cipal, but as we will soon see, the frequency of compounding has less of an impact 
than one would expect.

 fuTurE valuE of a Cd undEr QuarTErly 
Compounding
For comparison purposes we will use the same principal 1P = $15002 and the same 
APR (4.8%) as in Example 12. The only difference is that we are now looking at a 
CD that compounds quarterly (four times a year).
We will start by computing the future value of the CD after one year (four quar-
ters). To do so we need to find the balance on the account at the beginning of each 
quarter—that is the amount that generates the interest for that quarter. The compu-
tation is analogous to the one we used in Example 12 with one important difference: 
the interest rate for the quarter is not 4.8% (that’s the APR!) but rather 1.2% (the 
APR divided by four!).
The timeline showing the balance on the account at the start of each quarter is 
given below. (All sums are left as uncalculated numerical expressions—the time for 
number crunching is at the very end.)

We can use the same basic idea to find the future value 
of the CD after any number of years. The only number that 
will change is the exponent of (1.012). Table 2 shows the 
future value of the CD after t = 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 years 
under quarterly compounding. Notice the introduction of a 
new variable T representing the total number of times the 
interest was compounded.

fuTurE valuE of a Cd undEr monThly Compounding
We now consider the future value of a CD un-
der monthly compounding (12 times a year). For 
comparison purposes we will still use the principal 
P = $1500 and the APR of 4.8%, as in Examples 
12 and 13.
Now the interest rate in each compounding
period is 
4.8%
12 = 0.4% = 0.004, and there are 12
compounding 
periods 
per 
year. 
The 
future 
value of the CD after one year is given by 
F = $1500 * 11.004212 = $1573.61. Table 3 shows 
the future value of the CD after t = 1, 2, 5, 10, and 
15 years under monthly compounding. The total 
number of times the interest was compounded is 
given by T.
The idea behind Examples 13 and 14 can be generalized into what is known as the 
general compounding formula.
n general Compounding formula. The future value F of P dollars compounded a 
total of T times at a periodic interest rate p is F = P11 + p2T.
The general compounding formula F = P11 + p2T is an extension of the annual 
compounding formula F = P11 + r2t, but with two changes: The APR r is replaced 
by the periodic interest rate p (obtained by dividing the APR by the number of 
compounding periods in one year), and the number of years t in the exponent is 
replaced by T (the total number of times the interest is compounded over the life of 
the investment).
Table 4 shows the details of the general compounding formula when applied 
to a 15-year CD 1t = 152 with a principal P = $1500 and an APR of 4.8% using 
annual, semi-annual, quarterly, monthly, and daily compounding.

The surprising thing about the future values in Table 4 is how little they change as 
we crank up the frequency of compounding. You would think that over 15 years the 
difference between daily compounding and monthly compounding should be huge—
in reality the difference buys you a cup of coffee and a bagel (if you are lucky)!
A remarkable property of the general compounding formula is that there is a 
point at which cranking up the frequency of compounding makes very little difference

to the future value. If you were to add one more row to Table 4 for compounding on 
an hourly basis (24 hours a day, 365 days a year), you would see an increase in the 
future value (over daily compounding) of 14 cents.
Continuous Compounding
The ultimate form of compounding is continuous compounding—interest com-
pounded infinitely often over infinitely small compounding periods. The idea 
sounds great, but how do you calculate it? There is a surprisingly nice formula 
for computing future values under continuous compounding called the continuous 
compounding formula. The surprise is that the formula involves an unexpected 
guest—the irrational number e = 2.71828. . . (You may remember seeing e in the 
context of logarithms, but e plays an important role in financial mathematics as 
well.) To understand why e shows up in the continuous compounding formula 
requires some calculus, so we are just going to give the formula and omit any jus-
tification for it.
n Continuous Compounding formula. The future value F of P dollars compounded 
continuously for t years with an APR r is F = Pe rt.
 To use the continuous compounding formula you will need a calculator with 
an e x key. Since e is an irrational number with an infinite, nonrepeating deci-
mal expansion, a calculator can only give an approximate value for e rt and 
consequently for F itself. You can minimize the error by using a good scientific 
calculator. There are many good online scientific calculators available for free.
 The continuous compounding formula works even when the term t is a frac-
tional part of a year. For example, for a term of 5 years and 3 months you can 
 
use t = 51
4 = 5.25; for a term of 500 days you can use t =
500

so on.

For the last time, let’s consider a CD with principal P = $1500 
and APR of 4.8%, as in Examples 12 through 14, but this time 
the compounding is continuous. Table 5 shows the future value 
of the CD for terms of 1, 2, 5, 10, and 15 years.
Compare the numbers in Table 5 with those in Tables 2 and 
3, and you will understand why banks and credit unions don’t 
mind offering their customers continuous compounding on sav-
ings accounts and CDs. It’s better business to entice custom-
ers with continuous compounding than to offer higher APRs. 
(For example, a CD with 4.8% APR  compounded quarterly is a 
much better offer than a CD with 4.7% APR compounded con-
tinuously, even though the latter sounds a lot more impressive.)

savings accounts
Other than putting your money under the mattress, a savings account is the most 
conservative type of investment you can make. Savings accounts are extremely safe, 
and extremely liquid—in general you can take part or all of the money out at any 
time without a penalty (sometimes there are a few restrictions that apply for an 
initial time period).
341

Financial Mathematics 
Unlike a CD, a savings account has no term (you can leave your money in the 
savings account for as long as you want) and the APR is not locked—it may go up or 
down depending on interest rates in general. In a typical savings account the inter-
est is compounded continuously. So what’s not to like? There is just one problem 
with savings accounts—they have very low APRs, and, therefore, you don’t get very 
much interest. That’s the price you have to pay if you want a secure, safe, and liquid 
investment.
In the old days (20 or more years ago), when you opened a savings account you 
would get a passbook that would allow you to keep a record of your deposits and 
withdrawals. These days most people use an app on their smart phone to do the 
same. Even if you never plan to open a savings account or have a nice phone app 
that does the thinking for you, you should go over the next example carefully. The 
basic ideas behind the calculations in this example also apply to the calculation of 
credit card balances (Example 19), and that is something that concerns practically 
everyone.

ConTinuous Compounding in savings aCCounTs
Imagine you have a savings account with an APR of 1.8% compounded continu-

of $250 on March 27, a deposit of $400 on July 10, and a withdrawal of $300 on 
September 2. Let’s track the balances on your account for one calendar year (Jan. 
1–Dec. 31).
The deposit and withdrawals break up the calendar year into periods of various 
lengths. Table 6 (column 3) shows the length of each period and how the continuous 
compounding formula is applied to compute the balance in the account (column 5). 
There are 86 days in the period from January 1 to March 27—measured in years gives

annual percentage yield
The (sometimes called the effective rate) is the annual percentage increase on the 
value of an investment (or loan) when both the APR and the frequency of com-
pounding are taken into account. When comparing investments with different APRs 
and different compounding frequencies, the APY is the right tool to use. Which is 
a better investment: a 4.8% APR compounded semi-annually or a 4.7% APR com-
pounded continuously? Which one would you choose? We’ll answer the question in 
our next example.
Given the APR and the compounding frequency, the simplest way to find the 
APY is to compute the value of $1 at the end of one year. Depending on the type of 
compounding, we use either the general or the continuous compounding formula.

Which is a better investment: a 4.8% APR compounded semi-annually (twice a

and will answer it now by calculating the APY of each investment.

= 0.0242: In one year, P = $1
 
becomes F = $1 * (1.02422 = 11.02422 = $1.048576 (here we used the general 
compounding formula with T = 2). The percentage increase can be read directly 
from the decimal part of F—it is 4.8576%. The APY, therefore, is 4.8576%.
n 4.7% compounded continuously: In one year, P = $1 becomes F = $1 * e0.047 =
$1.048122 (here we used the continuous compounding formula with t = 1). The 
APY, therefore, is 4.8122%.
Comparing the two APYs, we can see that an APR of 4.8% compounded semi-
annually gives a better deal than an APR of 4.7% compounded continuously, but 
not by much.
In general, if the APR is r, the APY is given by:
n 311 + r
T2T - 14 when the compounding takes place T times a year.
n e r - 1 when the compounding is continuous.
Rather than memorize two more formulas, remember that what we are doing 
is finding the value of one dollar at the end of one year (using either the general or 
the continuous compounding formula), subtracting 1, and expressing the result as a 
percentage. The next example illustrates the point.

Financial Mathematics 
In this section we will focus on the two most common generators of consumer 
debt in a modern economy—credit cards and installment loans. According to the 
Federal Reserve, total consumer debt in the United States in 2012 was roughly 
$2.5 trillion. Credit card debt accounted for almost one third of it ($800 billion), 
and much of the rest was some form of installment loan debt, mainly mortgages 
and car loans. (Source: CreditCards.com, www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news
/credit-card-industry-facts-personal-debt-statistics-1276.php.)
Credit Card debt
A credit card is one of the most convenient and useful financial instruments in a 
modern economy. Merchants love them because consumers spend more than in a 
cash-only economy, and consumers love them because it allows them to purchase 
goods or services and pay for them at a later date. When properly used credit cards 
are a great deal, but credit cards also have a dark side to them—they generate 
massive amounts of consumer debt and financial stress.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total credit card debt carried 
by Americans is projected to exceed one trillion in 2013, and more than half 
of all American credit card holders carry a balance from month to month. 
Among college students who own a credit card, 82% carry a balance and 
pay finance charges (Fanny Mae 2009 survey). Perhaps the most surpris-
ing finding is that four out of five American credit card holders surveyed 
did not know how the finance charges on their credit cards are calculated 
and almost a third did not know what the APR on their credit card was.
The method used to calculate finance charges can vary from one 
credit card company to another, but they all follow the same basic 
script: As long as you pay the balance due in full before the payment due 
date you get a free ride and everything you purchase on the credit card is

dEmysTifying your CrEdiT Card sTaTEmEnT
A typical credit card statement covers a monthly billing cycle that always starts on 
the same day of the month (randomly chosen by the credit card company). Depend-
ing on the month, the number of days in the billing cycle is either 30 or 31 except for 
February, when it is 28 (or 29 in a leap year).
Let’s suppose that you have a MasterCard with an APR of 17.24% on standard 
purchases (the APR on cash advances is quite a bit higher, but we won’t worry about 
that in this example). The billing cycle starts on the 25th of each month and ends 
on the 24th of the next month. You are usually very good about paying the full bal-
ance due on the card each month, but in early April you went to Mexico with some 
friends on spring break vacation and charged more than usual to your credit card. 
For the April 25–May 24 billing cycle you were unable to pay the full balance on 
your card and had to carry over a $500 balance to your next cycle.
interest free (no finance charges); if you carry a revolving balance (i.e., you don’t 
pay the balance due in full) you incur finance charges on the balance and on any new 
purchases on the credit card made during the next billing cycle. Your previous bal-
ance minus your payment plus the finance charges plus any new charges will show 
up on your next statement as your new balance. One more thing: if you make your 
payment after the due date you incur a late payment penalty. 
Our next example illustrates in detail how finance charges are calculated on a 
typical credit card.

When your May 25–June 24 credit card bill arrives, 
these are the charges:
n May 25: Previous balance 1$5002
n May 28: Phone bill payment 1$85.752
n June 5: Gasoline purchase 1$452
n June 16: Groceries 1$73.602
Since you didn’t pay your previous balance in full, 
there will also be a finance charge in your bill. We will 
next show how the finance charge is computed. On most 
credit cards, finance charges are computed using simple 
interest applied to the average daily balance for the billing

The finance charges for the billing cycle can now be calculated. Since credit card 
interest is simple interest, the finance charge is found by multiplying the average 
daily balance by the periodic interest rate. In this case we get,
finance charge = $627.85 * 0.01464 = $9.19.
Finally, here is the new balance that will show up on your credit card bill on the next 
billing cycle:
 New balance = previous balance + purchases + finance charge =
$500 + $204.35 + $9.19 = $713.54.
cycle, so there are two things that you need to calculate—the periodic interest 
rate and the average daily balance.
The periodic interest rate is found by taking the number of days in the billing 
cycle, dividing by 365, and multiplying by the APR r. In this example, the APR on 
your MasterCard is r = 0.1724, and the number of days in the May 25–June 24 bill-
ing cycle is 31 (May has 31 days). This gives,
periodic interest rate = 131 , 3652 * 0.1724  0.01464.
The average daily balance is found by adding the daily balance for each day in the bill-
ing cycle and dividing the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This sounds 
like a lot of work, but the calculation can be simplified by breaking the billing cycle into 
periods where the daily balance is constant. A table such as Table 8 helps. We see from 
Table 8 that over the billing cycle there were three days with a daily balance of $500.00, 
eight days with a daily balance of $585.75, and so on. This gives
Average Daily Balance =
$
13 * 5002 + 18 * 585.752 + 111 * 630.752 + 19 * 704.352

= $627.85.
Calculation of Interest Charges. At the end of each billing
period we calculate your interest charges using the Average Daily
Balance method: (a) we first compute your Average Daily
Balance(1), and (b) we then multiply your Average Daily Balance
by the periodic interest rate(2).
 (1) For each day in the billing period, your daily balance equals
the beginning balance that day plus any new transactions minus
any payments and credits posted that day. To find the Average
Daily Balance we add the daily balances for each day in the billing
period and divide by the number of days in the billing period.
 (2) The periodic interest rate equals the APR times the number
of days in the billing period divided by 365.
Typical fine print on a credit card statement

Financial Mathematics 
If you pay off this balance in full on your next bill, you are back on the credit 
card gravy train where all your purchases are interest free. If you don’t, interest 
charges will continue to accumulate on all your future credit card purchases.
When properly used, credit cards offer the savvy consumer flexibility, safety, 
and free short-term credit. Here are a few basic tips that will help you make the best 
use of your credit card(s).
 1. Pay your balances in full each month. In and of itself, the $9.19 finance charge in 
Example 19 may not seem like much, but when credit card debt is carried over 
a long period of time, finance charges will add up to some serious money. The 
best investment you can make with your money is to pay off your credit card 
balances in full. Every once in a while, an emergency may arise where you can’t 
pay off the full balance—make a real effort to pay it off as soon as you can. (If 
you can borrow money at a lower interest rate than the APR on your card it 
makes sense to do it just to pay off your outstanding credit card balance.)
 2. Know the APR as well as other fees on your credit card. Pay attention to teaser 
rates—introductory rates that are very low (sometimes 0%) for a few months 
but then turn into a much higher rate later. If you pay your balances in full 
each month then the APR on your card is not nearly as important as if you 
don’t. Some credit cards have annual fees, some don’t. If your credit card has 
an annual fee you may want to consider whether paying that annual fee is 
worth it.
 3. Try not to use your credit card for cash advances. The APR on cash advances is 
much higher than the APR on purchases, and unlike standard purchases, finance 
charges on cash advances are computed from the moment you take the cash.
 4. Pay attention to the Due Date on your statement and always make your payments 
on time. There is a steep late payment penalty for paying after the statement due 
date. Even if you are completely broke, pay at least the minimum payment due 
each month (and get help!).
 5. It’s not only plastic! There is a basic psychological principle underlying credit 
card use—buying with a credit card is a lot easier than buying with cash. Study 
after study has shown that all other things being equal, people spend a lot more 
when they have a credit card than when they don’t. The attitude captured by 
the saying “It’s only plastic” is something we all need to be careful of and resist. 
It may be plastic for a few days or weeks, but when it’s time to pay the bill it 
becomes real money.
installment loans
Credit card debt is rarely intentional—consumers charge more than they can afford 
on their credit cards, are unable to pay the full balance when the bill is due, and start 
to accumulate credit card debt. Installment loan debt, on the other hand, is purpose-
ful and organized: The borrower pays the loan plus interest back to the lender in 
equal installments paid at regular intervals over the life of the loan. When the last 
installment is paid, the loan is completely paid off. The process of paying off a loan 
by making regular installment payments is called amortization, and we often say 
that a loan is being amortized over a certain length of time.
Installment loans provide a very important function in a modern economy—
they allow consumers to finance big-ticket purchases such as cars or homes, items 
that they would otherwise be unable to afford. Installment loans typically have 
much lower APRs than other types of consumer loans because the item financed by 
the loan (house, car, etc.) serves as collateral.
The amortization formula In the United States, almost all installment loans are 
based on monthly payments and the interest on the loan is compounded on a monthly  
basis. From here on, we will assume this is the case.

The amortization formula is based on a combination of the monthly compound-
ing formula (Section 3), and the geometric sum formula. To keep things simple, we 
will not show the derivation of the formula here.
If you do an Internet search for “amortization calculator,” you will find plenty of 
online amortization calculators (or mortgage calculators) that allow you to find the 
monthly payments given the loan principal P, the APR r, and the number of payments 
T, but you must be careful—not all calculators are based on the same assumptions. 
(The formula given above is based on the assumption that the first installment is paid 
one month after the origination of the loan, which is the standard for most installment 
loans.) Some calculators also allow you to calculate the principal P you can borrow 
when you know the monthly payment M, the APR r, and the number of payments T.

finanCing a nEw Car
You have just landed a really good job and are in the market for a new car. You 
found a nice energy-efficient car you really like and negotiate a good price with the 
dealer: $23,995 including taxes and license fees. In addition, the car manufacturer 
is offering a fantastic special promotion—you can choose between a $2000 manu-
facturer’s rebate or special financing at 1.2% APR for 60 months. If you choose the 
manufacturer’s rebate then you have to finance the balance at the dealer’s going 
rate of 6.48% APR for a 60-month loan. Which one should you choose?
If you take the $2000 manufacturer’s rebate and finance the balance through 
the dealer’s financing you will have a principal of P = $21,995, an APR r = 0.0648,
a monthly interest rate p =
0.0648
12
= 0.0054, and a total of T = 60 monthly payments. 
The amortization formula gives monthly payments of
M = $21,995 *
0.0054 * 11.0054260
11.0054260 - 1
= $430.15.
If instead of the rebate you choose to go with the special financing offer you 
will have a principal of P = $23,995, an APR r = 0.012, a monthly interest rate 
p = 0.012
12 = 0.001, and a total of T = 60 monthly payments. The amortization formula 
gives monthly payments of
M = $23,995 *
0.001 * 11.001260
11.001260 - 1
= $412.23.
Clearly, the special financing is a better deal than the manufacturer’s rebate—
you save almost $18 per monthly payment and over $1000 over the life of the loan. 
Not a bad thing to know!
Our final example for this chapter is about refinancing a home mortgage loan, 
a decision almost all homeowners face at one time or another: Should I take that 
“great” deal being offered to refinance my home at a lower APR? Is it worth it if I 
have to pay refinancing costs? If you own a home, you probably have received some 
of these refinancing offers. If you don’t, you no doubt know someone who has. In 
any case, once you face one of these situations, you are trapped—no matter what 
you do, you will be making a decision and a big one at that! If you ignore the offer 
you are making the decision to stay with your current loan; if you take the offer you 
are making the decision to abandon your current loan. Clearly, since a choice is  
unavoidable, you should have the tools to make the proper choice.

Imagine that you are a homeowner and have just received an offer in the mail to 
refinance your home loan. The offer is for a 6% APR on a 30-year mortgage. (As 
with all mortgage loans, the interest is compounded monthly.) In 
addition, there are loan origination costs: $1500 closing costs 
plus 1 point (1% of the amount of the loan). You are trying 
to decide if this offer is worth pursuing by comparing it with 
your current mortgage—a 30-year mortgage for $180,000 
with a 6.75% APR. Obviously, a 6% APR is a lot better 
than a 6.75% APR, but do the savings justify your up-front 
expenses for taking out the new loan? Besides, you have 
made 30 monthly payments on your current loan already. 
Will all these payments be wasted?
For a fair comparison between the two options (take 
out a new loan or keep the current loan), we will com-
pare the monthly payments on your current loan with the 
monthly payments you would be making if you took out the 
new loan for the balance of what you owe on your current loan. (This way 
we are truly comparing apples with apples.) We can then determine if the monthly 
savings on your payments justify the up-front loan origination costs of the new loan. 
The computation will involve several steps, and each step is based on an application 
of the amortization formula.
n step 1. Compute the monthly payment M on a $180,000, 30-year mortgage 
 
with 6.75% APR. Here P = $180,000, r = 0.0675, p =
0.0675
12
= 0.005625, and 
T = 360. The amortization formula gives monthly payments of
M = $180,000 *
0.005625 * 11.0056252360
11.0056252360 - 1
= $1167.48.
n step 2. Compute the balance on the mortgage with 6.75% APR after 30 monthly 
payments of $1167.48 have been made. Here M = $1167.48, r = 0.0675, p = 
 
0.0675
12
= 0.005625, and T = 330. The unknown is P. The amortization formula 
gives
$1167.48 = P *
0.005625 * 11.0056252330
11.0056252330 - 1
 
Solving for P gives
P = $1167.48 *
11.0056252330 - 1
0.005625 * 11.0056252330  $174,951.
n step 3. Compute the monthly payments on the new mortgage offer for a princi-
pal P = $174,951 and T = 330 months. Here r = 0.06 and p =
0.06
12 = 0.005. The 
amortization formula gives monthly payments of
M = $174,951 *
0.005 * 11.0052330
11.0052330 - 1
= $1083.75.
If you refinance, you will save $83.73 in monthly payments over your current 
mortgage, and it will take you a little over three years to recover the up-front costs 
of refinancing. If you think you will be staying in your home for more than three 
years it makes good sense to take the refinancing offer. If you plan to sell your home 
in the next few years or feel that interest rates will be coming down and you will find 
an even lower APR, you are better off staying put.

Financial Mathematics 
Whether it’s finding a good deal on an iPod, borrowing money to finance a vacation, 
or figuring out the financing of a new car, some of the most confounding decisions 
we make as independent adults are about money: how to spend, borrow, invest, 
and manage it. Good money management involves many intangible 
things—luck, timing, common sense, self-discipline, and so forth—and 
one very tangible thing—understanding the basics of financial math-
ematics.
Conclusion
This chapter started with a discussion of percentages. In everyday 
life percentages offer a convenient way to understand ratios and pro-
portions (as in “I got a 76% on the quiz”) as well as increases and decreases (as in 
“We are offering a 30% discount on all Rolling Stone CDs”). In financial mathemat-
ics percentages are the standard way to describe profits and losses as well as interest 
rates paid on investments or charged on loans.
Given the introductory nature of this chapter, we focused on the most basic types 
of financial transactions: investments such as bonds, CDs, and savings accounts, and 
consumer loans such as credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages. Whether an invest-
ment or a loan, the basic principle behind the transaction is the same: one party 
(the investor/lender) gives money to another party (the investee/borrower), with the 
hope that over time the investment/loan turns a profit. The three key words in the 
previous sentence (money, time, and profit) represent the three key ingredients in 
all the formulas we discussed in this chapter: (1) the sum of money invested, (2) the 
length of the investment, and (3) the interest expected by the lender or investor as a 
reward for the willingness to temporarily part with money.
The material covered in this chapter represents a good start toward helping you 
become a good manager of your money and make educated financial decisions. Al-
though there is always going to be an element of uncertainty in most financial deci-
sions, the mathematics you learned here should allow you to understand the nature 
of this uncertainty so that you can make the most informed possible choice. This, 
and a little luck, might indeed make you rich.
Waste neither time nor money, but 
make the best use of both.

 29. On Jan. 1 Mr. Green bought new energy-efficient windows 
for his home at Home Depot. The price of the windows was 
$5765, and Mr. Green charged the windows to his Home 
Depot credit card. The Home Depot credit card is interest 
free for a full six months on any purchase over $299, but, if 
after six months the purchase is not paid in full the customer 
owes interest on the original purchase price and for the full 
six months, even if the balance owed is one dollar. Inter-
est is computed as simple interest at an APR of 23.5%. Mr. 
Green was hoping he would have the windows paid off in 
six months and was close, but at the end of six months he 
still owed a balance of $200 on the windows. How much in-
terest did Mr. Green get charged on the Home Depot credit 
card statement that closed on July 1?

Financial Mathematics 
 1 The many faces of e
The irrational number e has many remarkable mathematical 
properties. In this project you are asked to present and dis-
cuss five of the more interesting mathematical properties of e. 
For each property, give a historical background (if possible), a 
simple mathematical explanation (avoid technical details if you 
can), and a real-life application (see, for example, reference 3).
 2 a future home buyer’s must-do project
In this project, you will investigate the process of buying a house. 
For the purposes of this project, we will assume that you are 
going to graduate at the end of this semester, get a job, and be-
gin saving for your first house. You will plan to buy your house 
five years after graduation. At that time, you will use the money 
you’ve saved as a down payment and take out a loan for the rest 
of the cost of the house.
As part of the project, you should address each of the fol-
lowing:
(a) Your projected salary for the first five years after you gradu-
ate. Describe what kind of a job you expect to have and 
what starting monthly salary is realistic for that type of job. 
Project the salary over five years, including raises and cost-
of-living increases. (Support all your salary assumptions 
with data and cite your sources.)
(b) Your savings and investments over the five-year period. 
For the purposes of this project, assume that 10% of the 
monthly salary you projected in Step 1 will be invested 
in a deferred annuity. Research the types of deferred 
annuities available to you and describe the terms, fees, 
and APR. Use the amount of money you will be able 
to save each month, the interest rate you have found, 
and your knowledge of annuities to compute how much 
money you will have after five years. Don’t forget to 
deduct any state and federal taxes you will be paying on 
your income from the annuities. Estimate your taxes on 
income from the annuities at 20% federal and 7% state. 
(If you expect to have a job in a no-income-tax state, 
disregard the 7% state tax.)
(c) How much you can afford to spend on a home and what your 
monthly mortgage expenses will be. To determine how much 
you can afford to spend on a home, use your estimate of 
how much you have saved for a down payment and assume 
that your down payment is 15% of the cost of the home. 
Research the types of home loans currently available to 
someone with your credit rating and income (assume the in-
come projected at the end of the five-year period). Describe 
the terms of a loan you might be able to take out, including 
the interest rate, type and length of loan, and loan origi-
nation fees. Once you found a loan, project your monthly 
mortgage payments (be sure to include property taxes and 
insurance). Once again, cite all the sources for your data 
and show all the formulas you are using for your calcula-
tions.

The Mathematics of Symmetry
From Chapter 11 of Excursions in Modern Mathematics, 8th Edition. Peter Tannenbaum. Copyright © 2014 by

The  
Mathematics 
of Symmetry
Beyond Reflection
If you are a good skateboarder, you can do a 360. If you are a great 
skateboarder, you can do a 720. If you are the world’s best, you can do 
a 900. But no matter how great you are, you can’t do a 920.
When Tony Hawk—considered by most to be the greatest skateboarder  
of his generation—set a world record in 1999 by doing a 900 (2 ½ 
rotations in the air while launching from a half-pipe), few people thought 
the record could be broken. But 13 years later, on March 26, 2012, Tom 
Schaar, a skateboarder from Malibu, California, pulled off an amazing 
feat—the first 1080 in skateboarding history. The fact that Tom Schaar 
was a 12-year-old sixth-grader makes the feat even more amazing.

 he shape of a skateboard is such that in order not to crash-land, a skate-
boarder can only rotate in the air a whole number of revolutions or a 
whole number plus one-half. After the 900, the next possible move is the 
1080—there is nothing in between. 
A skateboard is a fairly simple object—it has an oblong deck and four wheels 
(a pair in the front and a pair in the back). Its original function was to roll for-
ward or backward with equal ease—the jumping, spinning, and assorted tricks came 
much later, and they impress and amaze precisely because they are acts that defy the 
skateboard’s design. In contrast to a skateboard, a human body has a very complex 
design, a design that matches the complexity of what the human body is meant to do. 
There are many things that distinguish the design of a skateboard from the design 
of a human body, and one of the most significant is the nature of their symmetries.
In this chapter we will discuss the symmetry of things. By “things” we mean 
physical objects—things you can touch and feel such as a flower, a dollar bill, etc.—
and shapes—things you can draw or imagine such as a square, the letter Z, a wallpa-
per design, etc. We will use the word object to describe any of these things. For tech-
nical reasons only, we will focus on the symmetries of two-dimensional objects—a 
discussion of symmetry for three-dimensional objects is quite a bit more complicated  
and beyond the scope of this text.
This chapter starts with a discus-
sion of rigid motions (Section 1)—
a key concept in the study of sym-
metry. There are only four basic 
rigid motions for two-dimensional 
objects in the plane, and we dis-
cuss these separately: reflections 
(Section 2), rotations (Section 3), 
translations (Section 4), and glide 
reflections (Section 5). In Section 6 
we use rigid motions to formally de-
fine the concepts of symmetry and 
the symmetry type of an object. In 
Section 7 we discuss border and 
wallpaper patterns and their classi-
fication in terms of symmetry types.
T
Symmetry is a vast 
subject, significant in art 
and nature. Mathematics 
lies at its root, and it 
would be hard to find a 
better one on which to 
demonstrate the working 
of the mathematical 
intellect.

The Mathematics of Symmetry 
As are many other core concepts, symmetry is rather hard to define, and we will not 
even attempt a proper definition until Section 6. We will start our discussion with 
just an informal stab at a geometric interpretation of symmetry.

Even without a formal understanding of what symmetry is, most people would 
answer that the equilateral triangle in (c) is the most symmetric and the scalene tri-
angle in (a) is the least symmetric. This is in fact correct, but why? Think of an imagi-
nary observer—say a tiny (but very observant) ant—standing at one of the vertices 
of a triangle, looking toward the opposite side. In the case of the scalene triangle (a), 
the view from each vertex is different. In the case of the isosceles triangle (b), the 
view from vertices B and C is the same, but the view from vertex A is different. In 
the case of the equilateral triangle (c), the view is the same from each of the three 
vertices.
Let’s say, for starters, that symmetry is a property of an object that looks the 
same to an observer standing at different vantage points. This is still pretty vague 
but a start nonetheless. Now instead of talking about an observer moving around 
to different vantage points think of the object itself moving—forget the observer. 
For example, saying that the isosceles triangle in Fig. 1(b) looks the same to an 
observer whether he or she stands at vertex B or vertex C is equivalent to saying 
that the triangle itself can be moved so that vertices B and C swap locations and 
the triangle as a whole looks exactly as it did before. And the equilateral triangle in 
Fig. 1(c) can be moved in even more ways so that after the move it looks exactly as it 
did before. Thus, we might think of symmetry as having to do with ways to move an 
object so that when all the moving is done, the object looks exactly as it did before.
Given the preceding observations, it is not surprising that to understand symme-
try we need to understand the various ways in which we can “move” an object. This 
is our lead-in to what is a key concept in this chapter—the notion of a rigid motion.

rigid motions
The act of taking an object and moving it from some starting position to some 
ending position without altering its shape or size is called a rigid motion (and 
sometimes an isometry). If, in the process of moving the object, we stretch it, 
tear it, or generally alter its shape or size, the motion is not a rigid motion. 
Since in a rigid motion the size and shape of an object are not altered, distances 
between points are preserved: The distance between any two points X and Y in 
the starting position is the same as the distance between the same two points in 
the ending position. Figure 2 illustrates the difference between a motion that is 
rigid and one that is not. In (a), the motion does not change the shape of the 
object; only its position in space has changed. In (b), both position and shape 
have changed.

In defining rigid motions we are completely result oriented. We are only con-
cerned with the net effect of the motion—where the object started and where the 
object ended. What happens during the “trip” is irrelevant. This implies that a rigid 
motion is completely defined by the starting and ending positions of the object being 
moved, and two rigid motions that move an object from the same starting position 
to the same ending position are equivalent rigid motions—never mind the details of 
how they go about it (Fig. 3).

A rigid motion of the plane—let’s call it —moves each point in the plane 
from its starting position P to an ending position P, also in the plane. (From here 
on we will use script letters such as  and  to denote rigid motions, which should 
eliminate any possible confusion between the point M and the rigid motion .) We 
will call the point P the image of the point P under the rigid motion  and describe 
this informally by saying that  moves P to P. (We will also stick to the convention 
that the image point has the same label as the original point but with a prime symbol 
added.) It may happen that a point P is moved back to itself under , in which case 
we call P a fixed point of the rigid motion .

The Mathematics of Symmetry 
When it comes to how a rigid motion can move an object, the number of 
possibilities is surprisingly small. In the case of two-dimensional objects mov-
ing in a plane, there are only four possibilities. The four types of rigid motions 
(called basic rigid motions) are (1) reflections, (2) rotations, (3) translations, and 
(4) glide reflections. There are no other possibilities. Essentially, this means that 
when you move a two-dimensional object in the plane, no matter how compli-
cated the motion might be, the net result is equivalent to one, and only one, of 
these four basic types. (If you are curious, in the case of three-dimensional ob-
jects moving in space, there are six basic types of rigid motions: reflections, rota-
tions, translations, glide reflections, and two new types called rotary reflections 
and screw displacements.)
We will now discuss each of the four basic rigid motions of the plane in a little 
more detail.
A reflection in the plane is a rigid motion that moves an object into a new posi-
tion that is a mirror image of the starting position. In two dimensions, the “mir-
ror” is a line called the axis of reflection.
From a purely geometric point of view, a reflection can be defined by 
showing how it moves a generic point P in the plane. This is shown in Fig. 4: 
The image of any point P is found by drawing a line through P perpendicular 
to the axis of reflection l and finding the point P on the opposite side of l at 
the same distance as P from l. Points on the axis itself are fixed points of the 
reflection [Fig. 4(b)].

rEflEctionS of a trianglE
Figure 5 shows three cases of reflec-
tion of a triangle ABC. In all cases the 
original triangle ABC is shaded in blue 
and the reflected triangle A B C is 
shaded in red. In (a), the axis of reflec-
tion l does not intersect the triangle 
ABC. In (b), the axis of reflection l cuts 
through the triangle ABC—here the 
points where l intersects the triangle 
are fixed points of the triangle. In (c), 
the reflected triangle A B C falls on 
top of the original triangle ABC. The vertex B is a fixed point of the triangle, but the 
vertices A and C swap positions under the reflection.
The following are simple but useful properties of a reflection.
 1. A reflection is completely determined by its axis l. If we know the axis of reflec-
tion, we can find the image of any point P under the reflection (just drop a per-
pendicular to the axis through P and find the point on the other side of the axis 
that is at an equal distance).
 2. A reflection is completely determined by two points (a point and its image). If 
we know a point P and its image P under the reflection (and assuming P is 
different from P), we can find the axis l of the reflection (it is the perpendicular 
bisector of the segment PP). Once we have the axis l of the reflection, we can 
find the image of any other point (property 1).

	3.	 A reflection has infinitely many fixed points. The fixed points of a reflection are 
all the points on the axis l. Points not on the axis of reflection are never fixed.
	4.	 Reflections are improper rigid motions. An improper rigid motion is one that 
changes the left-right and clockwise-counterclockwise orientations of objects. 
This property is the reason a left hand reflected in a mirror looks like a right 
hand (Fig. 6) and the hands of a clock reflected in a mirror move counterclock-
wise.
	5.	 Under a reflection, the image of the image is the original object. For any point P, 
if P is its image then the image of P is P. This means that when we apply the 
same reflection twice, every point ends up in its original position and the rigid 
motion is equivalent to not having moved the object at all.
A rigid motion that is equivalent to not moving the object at all is called the 
identity motion. At first blush it may seem somewhat silly to call the identity 
motion a motion (after all, nothing moves), but there are very good mathemati-
cal reasons to do so, and we will soon see how helpful this convention is for 
studying and classifying symmetries.
The five properties of reflections listed above can be summarized as follows.
Example 3	
Rotations of a Triangle
Figure 8 illustrates three cases of rotation of a triangle ABC. In all cases the original 
triangle ABC is shaded in blue and the reflected triangle A B C is shaded in red. 
In (a), the rotocenter O lies outside the triangle ABC. The 90° clockwise rotation 
moved the triangle from the “12 o’clock position” to the “3 o’clock position.” (Note 
that a 90° counterclockwise rotation would have moved the triangle ABC to the  
“9 o’clock position.”) In (b), the rotocenter O is at the center of the triangle ABC. 
The 180° rotation turns the triangle “upside down.” For obvious reasons, a 180° ro-
tation is often called a half-turn. (With half-turns the result is the same whether we 
rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, so it is unnecessary to specify a direction.) In 
(c), the 360° rotation moves every point back to its original position—from the rigid 
motion point of view it’s as if the triangle had not moved.
n	 A reflection is completely determined by its axis l.
n	 A reflection is completely determined by a single point-image pair P and P
(as long as P ? P).
n	 A reflection has infinitely many fixed points (all points on l).
n	 A reflection is an improper rigid motion.
n	 When the same reflection is applied twice, we get the identity motion.
Properties of Reflections
Informally, a rotation in the plane is a rigid motion that pivots or swings an object 
around a fixed point O. A rotation is defined by two pieces of information: (1) the 
rotocenter (the point O that acts as the center of the rotation) and (2) the angle of 
rotation (actually the measure of an angle indicating the amount of rotation). (We 
will describe angle measures using degrees, but converting degrees to radians or 
radians to degrees is easy if you just remember that 180 degrees equals p radians.) 
In addition, it is necessary to specify the direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) 
associated with the angle of rotation.
Figure 7 illustrates geometrically how a clockwise rotation with rotocenter O 
and angle of rotation a moves a point P to the point P.

propErtiES of rotationS
The following are some important properties of a rotation.
 1. A rotation is completely determined by four points (two points and their respective 
images). Unlike a reflection, a rotation cannot be determined by a single point-
image pair P and P; it takes a second point-image pair Q and Q to nail down the 
rotation. The reason is that infinitely many rotations can move P to P: Any point 
located on the perpendicular bisector of the segment PP can be a rotocenter for 
such a rotation, as shown in Fig. 9(a). Given a second pair of points Q and Q we 
can identify the rotocenter O as the point where the perpendicular bisectors of 
PP and QQ meet, as shown in Fig. 9(b). Once we have identified the rotocenter 
O, the angle of rotation a is given by the measure of angle POP (or for that mat-
ter QOQ—they are the same). [Note: In the special case where PP and QQ 
happen to have the same perpendicular bisector, as in Fig. 9(c), the rotocenter O 
is the intersection of PQ and PQ.]
 2. The rotocenter is the only fixed point of a rotation. This is true for all rotations 
except for the identity (where all points are fixed points).
 3.  A rotation is a proper rigid motion. A proper rigid motion is one where the 
left-right and clockwise-counterclockwise orientations are preserved. A rotated 
left hand remains a left hand, and the hands of a rotated clock still move in the 
clockwise direction.
A common misconception is to confuse a 180 rotation with a reflection, but 
we can see that they are very different from just observing that the reflection is an 
improper rigid motion, whereas the 180 rotation is a proper rigid motion.
 4. A 360° rotation is the identity motion. A 360 rotation is equivalent to a 0 rota-
tion, and a 0 rotation is just the identity motion. (The expression “going around 
full circle” is the well-known colloquial version of this property.)
It follows that all rotations can be described using an angle of rotation between 
0 and 360. For angles larger than 360 we divide the angle by 360 and just use the 
remainder (for example, a clockwise rotation by 759 is equivalent to a clockwise 
rotation by 39; the remaining 720 count as 0). In addition, we can describe a 
rotation using clockwise or counterclockwise orientations (for example, a clockwise 
rotation by 39 is equivalent to a counterclockwise rotation by 321).
The four properties of rotations listed above can be summarized as follows.

The Mathematics of Symmetry 
A translation consists of essentially dragging an object in a specified direction and 
by a specified amount (the length of the translation). The two pieces of information 
(direction and length of the translation) are combined in the form of a vector of 
translation (usually denoted by v). The vector of translation is represented by an 
arrow—the arrow points in the direction of translation and the length of the arrow 
is the length of the translation. A very good illustration of a translation in a two-
dimensional plane is the dragging of the cursor on a computer screen (Fig. 10). Re-
gardless of what happens in between, the net result when you drag an icon on your 
screen is a translation in a specific direction and by a specific length.
Translations

figurE 10 
The following are some important properties of a translation.
figurE 12 
 1. A translation is completely determined by two points (a point and its 
image). If we are given a point P and its image P under a translation, 
the arrow joining P to P gives the vector of the translation. Once we 
know the vector of the translation, we know where the translation 
moves any other point. Thus, a single point-image pair P and P is all 
we need to completely determine the translation.
 2. A translation has no fixed points. In a translation, every point gets 
moved some distance and in some direction, so there can’t be any 
fixed points.
 3. A translation is a proper rigid motion. When an object is translated, 
left-right and clockwise-counterclockwise orientations are preserved: 
A translated left hand is still a left hand, and the hands of a translated clock still 
move in the clockwise direction (Fig. 12).
 4. A translation followed by the same translation in the opposite direction is the 
identity. The effect of a translation with vector v can be undone by a translation 
of the same length but in the opposite direction (Fig. 13). The vector for this op-
posite translation can be conveniently described as -v. Thus, a translation with 
vector v followed with a translation with vector -v is equivalent to the identity 
motion.

direction and has the right length, the placement of the arrow in the picture is im-
material.

propErtiES of tranSlationS
A glide reflection is a rigid motion obtained by combining a translation (the glide) 
with a reflection. Moreover, the axis of reflection must be parallel to the direction 
of translation. Thus, a glide reflection is described by two things: the vector of the 
translation v and the axis of the reflection l, and these two must be parallel. The 
footprints left behind by someone walking on soft sand (Fig. 14) are a classic ex-
ample of a glide reflection: right and left footprints are images of each other under 
the combined effects of a reflection (left foot–right foot) and a translation (the step).

glidE rEflEction of a trianglE
Figure 15 illustrates the result of applying the glide reflection with vector v and axis 
l to the triangle ABC. We can do this in two different ways, but the final result will 
be the same. In Fig. 15(a), the translation is applied first, moving triangle ABC to 
the intermediate position A* B* C*. The reflection is then applied to A* B* C*, giv-
ing the final position A B C. If we apply the reflection first, the triangle ABC gets 
moved to the intermediate position A* B* C* [Fig. 15(b)] and then translated to the 
final position A B C.
Notice that any point and its image under the glide reflection [for example, A 
and A in Fig. 15(a)] are on opposite sides but equidistant from the axis l. This im-
plies that the midpoint of the segment joining a point and its image under a glide 
reflection must fall on the axis l [point M in Fig. 15(a)].

The following are a few basic properties of a glide reflection.
 1. A glide reflection is completely determined by four points (two points and their 
respective images). Given a point-image pair P and P under a glide reflection, 
we do not have enough information to determine the glide reflection, but we do 
know that the axis l must pass through the midpoint of the line segment PP. 
Given a second point-image pair Q and Q, we can determine the axis of the re-
flection: It is the line passing through the points M (midpoint of the line segment 
PP) and N (midpoint of the line segment QQ), as shown in Fig. 16(a). Once 
we find the axis of reflection l, we can find the image of one of the points—say 
P—under the reflection. This gives the intermediate point P*, and the vector 
that moves P to P* is the vector of translation v, as shown in Fig. 16(b). [In the 
event that the midpoints of PP and QQ are the same point M, as shown in Fig. 
16(c), we can still find the axis l by drawing a line perpendicular to the line PQ 
passing through the common midpoint M.]
n A glide reflection is completely determined by two point-image pairs P, P 
and Q, Q.
n A glide reflection has no fixed points.
n A glide reflection is an improper rigid motion.
n When a glide reflection with vector v and axis of reflection l is followed with 
a glide reflection with vector -v and the same axis of reflection l we get the 
identity motion.
propErtiES of glidE rEflEctionS
 2. A glide reflection has no fixed points. A fixed point of a glide reflection would 
have to be a point that ends up exactly where it started after it is first translated 
and then reflected. This cannot happen because the translation moves every 
point and the reflection cannot undo the action of the translation.
 3. A glide reflection is an improper rigid motion. A glide reflection is a combination of 
a proper rigid motion (the translation) and an improper rigid motion (the reflec-
tion). Since the translation preserves left-right and clockwise-counterclockwise  
orientations but the reflection reverses them, the net result under a glide reflec-
tion is that orientations are reversed.
 4. A glide reflection followed by the same glide reflection in the opposite direction 
is the identity. To be more precise, if we move an object under a glide reflection 
with vector of translation v and axis of reflection l and then follow it with an-
other glide reflection with vector of translation -v and axis of reflection still l, 
we get the identity motion. It is as if the object was not moved at all.
The four properties of glide reflections listed above can be summarized as  
follows.

The Mathematics of Symmetry 
With an understanding of the four basic rigid motions and their properties, we can 
now look at the concept of symmetry in a much more precise way. Here, finally, is 
a good definition of symmetry, one that probably would not have made much sense 
at the start of this chapter: A symmetry of an object is a rigid motion that moves the 
object back onto itself.
One useful way to think of a symmetry is this: You observe the position of 
an object, and then, while you are not looking, the object is moved. If you can’t 
tell that the object was moved, the rigid motion is a symmetry. It is important 
to note that this does not necessarily force the rigid motion to be the identity 
motion. Individual points may be moved to different positions, even though the 
whole object is moved back into itself. And, of course, the identity motion is 
itself a symmetry, one possessed by every object and that from now on we will 
simply call the identity.
Since there are only four basic kinds of rigid motions of two-dimensional objects 
in two-dimensional space, there are also only four possible types of symmetries:  
reflection symmetries, rotation symmetries, translation symmetries, and glide reflection 
symmetries.

thE SymmEtriES of a SquarE
What are the possible rigid motions that move the square in Fig. 17(a) back onto 
itself? First, there are reflection symmetries. For example, if we use the line l1 in Fig. 
17(b) as the axis of reflection, the square falls back into itself with points A and B 
interchanging places and C and D interchanging places. It is not hard to think of 
three other reflection symmetries, with axes l2, l3, and l4 as shown in Fig. 17(b). Are 
there any other types of symmetries? Yes—the square has rotation symmetries as 
well. Using the center of the square O as the rotocenter, we can rotate the square by 
an angle of 90°. This moves the upper-left corner A to the upper-right corner B, B 
to the lower-right corner C, C to the lower-left corner D, and D to the upper-right 
corner A. Likewise, rotations with rotocenter O and angles of 180°, 270°, and 360°, 
respectively, are also symmetries of the square. Notice that the 360° rotation is just 
the identity.

All in all, we have easily found eight symmetries for the square in Fig. 17(a): 
Four of them are reflections, and the other four are rotations. Could there be more? 
What if we combined one of the reflections with one of the rotations? A symmetry 
combined with another symmetry, after all, has to be itself a symmetry. It turns out 
that the eight symmetries we listed are all there are—no matter how we combine 
them we always end up with one of the eight (see Exercise 74).

Let’s now consider the symmetries of the shape shown in Fig. 18(a)—a two- di-

blades. Once again, we have a shape with four reflection symmetries [the axes of 
reflection are l1, l2, l3, and l4 as shown in Fig. 18(b)] and four rotation symmetries 
[with rotocenter located at the center of the propeller and angles of 90°, 180°, 270°, 
and 360°, respectively, as shown in Fig. 18(c)]. And, just as with the square, there 
are no other possible symmetries.

Let’s consider now the propeller shown in Fig. 20(a). This propeller is only slightly 
different from the one in Example 7, but from the symmetry point of view the dif-
ference is significant—here we still have the four rotation symmetries (90°, 180°, 
270°, and 360°), but there are no reflection symmetries! [This makes sense because 
the individual blades of the propeller have no reflection symmetry. As can be seen 
in Fig. 20(c), a vertical reflection is not a symmetry, and neither are any of the other 
reflections.] This object belongs to a new symmetry family called Z4 (shorthand for 
the symmetry type of objects having four rotations only).

An important lesson lurks behind Examples 6 and 7: Two different-
looking objects can have exactly the same set of symmetries. A good way to think 
about this is that the square and the propeller, while certainly different objects, 
are members of the same “symmetry family” and carry exactly the same symmetry 
genes. Formally, we will say that two objects or shapes are of the same symmetry 
type if they have exactly the same set of symmetries. The propeller in Fig. 18 and a 
square both have the same symmetry type called D4 (shorthand for four reflections 
plus four rotations). The four-point star, the four-leaf clover, and the decorative tile 
shown in Fig. 19 also have four reflection and four rotation symmetries and, there-
fore, have symmetry type D4.

One of the most common symmetry types occurring in nature is that of objects 
having a single reflection symmetry plus a single rotation symmetry (the identity). 
This symmetry type is called D1. Figure 23 shows several examples of shapes and 
objects having symmetry type D1. Notice that it doesn’t matter if the axis of reflec-
tion is vertical, horizontal, or slanted.

Many objects and shapes are informally considered to have no symmetry at all, but 
this is a little misleading, since every object has at least the identity symmetry. Ob-
jects whose only symmetry is the identity are said to have symmetry type Z1. Figure 
24 shows a few examples of objects of symmetry type Z1—there are plenty of such 
objects around.

In everyday language, certain objects and shapes are said to be “highly symmetric” 
when they have lots of rotation and reflection symmetries. Figures 25(a) and (b) 
show two very different looking snowflakes, but from the symmetry point of view 
they are the same: All snowflakes have six reflection symmetries and six rotation 
symmetries. Their symmetry type is D6. (Try to find the six axes of reflection sym-
metry and the six angles of rotation symmetry.) The ornamental lace design shown 
in Fig. 25(c) has 10 rotation and 10 reflection symmetries. The symmetry type is D10. 
The kaleidoscopic design shown in Fig. 25(d) has 12 reflection and 12 rotation sym-
metries, and its symmetry type is D12.

thE SymmEtry typE DH
Are there two-dimensional objects with infinitely many symmetries? The answer is 
yes—circles and circular washers. A circle has infinitely many reflection symmetries 
(any line passing through the center of the circle can serve as an axis) as well as infi-
nitely many rotation symmetries (use the center of the circle as a rotocenter and any 
angle of rotation will work). We call the symmetry type of the circle D (the  is the 
mathematical symbol for “infinity”).
In each of the objects in Example 12, the number of reflections matches the 
number of rotations. This was also true in Examples 6, 7, and 10. Coincidence? Not 
at all. When a finite object has both reflection and rotation symmetries, the number 
of rotation symmetries (which includes the identity) has to match the number of re-
flection symmetries! Any finite object or shape with exactly N reflection symmetries 
and N rotation symmetries is said to have symmetry type DN. The D comes from 
dihedral symmetry—the technical mathematical term used to describe this group of 
symmetry types.
We now know that if a finite two-dimensional shape has rotations and reflec-
tions, it must have exactly the same number of each. In this case, the shape belongs 
to the D family of symmetries, specifically, it has symmetry type DN. However, we 
also saw in Examples 8, 9, and 11 shapes that have rotations, but no reflections. In 
this case, we used the notation ZN to describe the symmetry type, with the sub-
script N indicating the actual number of rotations.

Figure 26(a) shows a hibiscus flower with five petals. There are five rotation sym-
metries (we are assuming the ideal situation where the petals are identical), but 
there are no reflections possible because the petals themselves have no reflection  
symmetry. The symmetry type of the flower is Z5. The pinwheel shown in Fig. 26(b) 
has eight rotation symmetries but no reflection symmetries—its symmetry type is Z8. 
The airplane turbine engine shown in Fig. 26(c) has 45 equally spaced asymmetric 
blades—its symmetry type is Z45.
We are now in a position to classify the possible symmetries of any finite two-
dimensional shape or object. (The word finite is in there for a reason, which will 
become clear in the next section.) The possibilities boil down to a surprisingly short 
list of symmetry types:

The Mathematics of Symmetry 
Well, we’ve come a long way, but we have yet to see examples of shapes having 
translation or glide reflection symmetry. If we think of objects as being finite, trans-
lation symmetry is impossible: A slide will always move the object to a new position 
different from its original position! But if we broaden our horizons and consider 
infinite “objects,” translation and glide reflection symmetries are indeed possible.
We will formally define a pattern as an infinite “object” consisting of an infi-
nitely repeating basic design called the motif of the pattern. The reason we have 
“object” in quotation marks is that a pattern is really an abstraction—in the real 
world there are no infinite objects as such, although the idea of an infinitely repeat-
ing motif is familiar to us from such everyday objects as pottery, textiles, and tile 
designs (Fig. 27).
Patterns
7
Just like finite shapes, patterns can be classified by their symmetries. The clas-
sification of patterns according to their symmetry type is of fundamental importance 
in the study of molecular and crystal organization in chemistry, so it is not surprising 
that some of the first people to investigate the symmetry types of patterns were 
crystallographers. Archaeologists and anthropologists have also found that analyz-
ing the symmetry types used by a particular culture in their textiles and pottery helps 
them gain a better understanding of that culture.
We will briefly discuss the symmetry types of border and wallpaper patterns. A 
comprehensive study of patterns is beyond the scope of this text, so we will not go 
into as much detail as we did with finite shapes.
n DN. This is the symmetry type of shapes with both rotation and reflection sym-
metries. The subscript N 1N = 1, 2, 3, etc.2 denotes the number of reflection 
symmetries, which is always equal to the number of rotation symmetries. (The 
rotations are an automatic consequence of the reflections—an object can’t 
have reflection symmetries without having an equal number of rotation sym-
metries.)
n ZN. This is the symmetry type of shapes with rotation symmetries only. The 
subscript N 1N = 1, 2, 3, etc.2 denotes the number of rotation symmetries.
n DH
 . This is the symmetry type of a circle and of circular objects such as rings and 
washers, the only possible two-dimensional shapes or objects with an infinite 
number of rotations and reflections.

We will now discuss what kinds of symmetries are possible in a border 
pattern. Fortunately, the number of possibilities is quite small.
n  translations. A border pattern always has translation symmetries —they 
come with the territory. There is a basic translation symmetry v (v moves 
each copy of the motif one unit to the right), the opposite translation -v, 
and any multiple of v or -v (Fig. 29).
n  reflections. A border pattern can have (a) no reflection symmetry [Fig. 
30(a)], (b) horizontal reflection symmetry only [Fig. 30(b)], (c) vertical reflec-
tion symmetries only [Fig. 30(c)], or (d) both horizontal and vertical reflection 
symmetries [Fig. 30(d)]. In this last case the border pattern automatically picks 
up a half-turn symmetry as well. In terms of reflection symmetries, Fig. 30 il-
lustrates the only four possibilities for reflection symmetry in a border pattern.

n rotations. Like with any other object, the identity is a rotation symmetry of ev-
ery border pattern, so every border pattern has at least one rotation symmetry. 
The only other possible rotation symmetry of a border pattern is a 180 rotation. 
Clearly, no other angle of rotation can take a horizontal pattern and move it back 
onto itself. Thus, in terms of rotation symmetry there are two kinds of border 
patterns: those whose only rotation symmetry is the identity and those having 
a half-turn (180 rotation) symmetry in addition to the identity. The former are 
border patterns that have a right side “up” [Fig. 31(a)]; the latter are border 
patterns that have no “up” or “down”—they look the same either way [Fig. 
31(b)].

border patterns
Border patterns (also called linear patterns) are patterns in which a basic motif re-
peats itself indefinitely in a single direction (or creates the illusion of doing so), as in 
a decorative fabric, a ribbon, or a ceramic pot (Fig. 28).
The most common direction in a border pattern (what we will call the direction 
of the pattern) is horizontal, but in general a border pattern can be in any direction 
(vertical, slanted 45°, etc.). (For typesetting in a book, it is much more convenient 
to display a border pattern horizontally, so you will only see examples of horizontal 
border patterns.)

Combining the preceding observations, we get the following list of possible sym-
metries of a border pattern. (For simplicity, we assume that the border pattern is in 
a horizontal direction.)
 1. The identity: Everything has identity symmetry.
 2. Translation: By definition all border patterns have translation symmetry 
(Fig. 29).
 3. Horizontal reflection: Some border patterns have it, some don’t. There is only 
one possible horizontal axis of reflection, and it must run through the middle of 
the pattern [Fig. 30(b)].
 4. Vertical reflection: Some border patterns have it, some don’t. Vertical axes of re-
flection (i.e., axes perpendicular to the direction of the pattern) can run through 
the middle of a motif or between two motifs [Fig. 30(c)].
 5. Half-turn: Some border patterns have it, some don’t. Rotocenters can be located 
at the center of a motif or between two motifs [Fig. 31(b)].
 6. Glide reflection: Some border patterns have it, some don’t. Neither the reflection 
nor the glide can be symmetries on their own. The length of the glide is half that 
of the basic translation. The axis of the reflection runs through the middle of the 
pattern [Figs. 32(b) and (c)].
Based on the various possible combinations of these symmetries, border pat-
terns can be classified into just seven different symmetry types, which we list next. 
(Since all border patterns have identity symmetry and translation symmetry, we will 
only make reference to the additional symmetries.)
n type 11. This symmetry type represents border patterns that have no symme-
tries beyond the identity and translation symmetry. The pattern of J’s in Fig. 
30(a) is an example of this symmetry type.
n type 1m. This symmetry type represents border patterns with just horizontal 
reflection symmetry. The pattern of B’s in Fig. 30(b) is an example of this sym-
metry type.
n glide reflections. A border pattern can have a glide reflection symmetry, but 
there is only one way this can happen: The axis of reflection has to be a line 
along the center of the pattern, and the reflection part of the glide reflection is not 
by itself a symmetry of the pattern. This means that a border pattern having hori-
zontal reflection symmetry such as the one shown in Fig. 32(a) is not considered 
to have glide reflection symmetry. On the other hand, the border pattern shown 
in Fig. 32(b) does not have horizontal reflection symmetry (the footprints do not 
get reflected into footprints), but a glide by the vector w combined with a reflec-
tion along the axis l result in an honest-to-goodness glide reflection symmetry. 
(An important property of the glide reflection symmetry is that the vector w is 
always half the length of the basic translation symmetry v. This implies that two 
consecutive glide reflection symmetries are equivalent to the basic translation 
symmetry.) The border pattern in Fig. 32(c) has vertical reflection symmetry as 
well as glide reflection symmetry. In these cases half-turn symmetry (rotocenter 
O) comes free in the bargain.

The Mathematics of Symmetry 
n type m1. This symmetry type represents border patterns with just vertical reflec-
tion symmetry. The pattern of A’s in Fig. 30(c) is an example of this symmetry 
type.
n type mm. This symmetry type represents border patterns with both a horizontal 
and a vertical reflection symmetry. When both of these symmetries are present, 
there is also half-turn symmetry. The pattern of X’s in Fig. 30(d) is an example 
of this symmetry type.
n type 12. This symmetry type represents border patterns with only half-turn sym-
metry. The pattern of Z’s in Fig. 31(b) is an example of this symmetry type.
n type 1g. This symmetry type represents border patterns with only glide reflec-
tion symmetry. The pattern of footprints in Fig. 32(b) is an example of this sym-
metry type.
n type mg. This symmetry type represents border patterns with vertical reflection 
and glide reflection symmetry. When both of these symmetries are present, there 
is also half-turn symmetry. The pattern in Fig. 32(c) is an example of this sym-
metry type.

metry types.

wallpaper patterns
Wallpaper patterns are patterns that cover the plane by repeating a motif indefi-
nitely along two or more nonparallel directions. Typical examples of such patterns 
can be found in wallpaper (of course), carpets, and textiles.
With wallpaper patterns things get a bit more complicated, so we will skip the 
details. The possible symmetries of a wallpaper pattern are as follows:
n  translations. Every wallpaper pattern has translation sym-
metry in at least two different (nonparallel) directions  
(Fig. 33).
n  reflections. A wallpaper pattern can have (a) no reflections, 
(b) reflections in only one direction, (c) reflections in two 
nonparallel directions, (d) reflections in three nonparallel 
directions, (e) reflections in four nonparallel directions, and 
(f) reflections in six nonparallel directions. There are no 
other possibilities. (Note that it is not possible for a wall-
paper pattern to have reflections in exactly five different 
directions.)

n The oddball, two-symbol codes 
are a classification scheme originally 
developed by crystallographers 
called the standard crystallographic 
notation. The first symbol is either 
an m (indicating that the pattern has 
vertical reflections) or a 1 (indicating 
no vertical reflections). The second 
symbol specifies the existence of 
a horizontal reflection (m), a glide 
reflection (g), a half-turn (2), or none 
of these (1).

There is no doubt that a Z and a queen of spades are two very 
different things (Fig. 34)—they look different and they serve 
completely different purposes. In a very fundamental way, 
however, they share a very important characteristic: They have 
exactly the same set of symmetries (identity and half-turn). Un-
derstanding the symmetries of an object and being able to sort 
and classify the objects in our physical world by their symme-
tries is a rare but useful skill, and artists, designers, architects, 
archaeologists, chemists, and mathematicians often rely on it. 
In this chapter we explored some of the basic ideas behind the 
mathematical study of symmetry.
Although we live in a three-dimensional world inhabited by mostly three- 
dimensional objects and shapes, in this chapter we restricted ourselves to studying 
the symmetries of two-dimensional objects and shapes for the simple reason that it 
is a lot easier.
A first important step in understanding symmetries is to understand the differ-
ent kinds of rigid motions—motions that move an object while preserving its origi-
nal shape. It is somewhat surprising that despite the infinite freedom we have to 
move an object, for two-dimensional objects there are just four basic types of rigid 
motions: reflections, rotations, translations, and glide reflections. In other words, no 
matter how complicated or convoluted the actual “trip” taken by the object might 
appear to be, in the final analysis the motion is equivalent to a single reflection, a 
single rotation, a single translation, or a single glide reflection.
From the four different kinds of rigid motions in the plane we inherit the four 
different possible kinds of symmetry in the plane—reflection, rotation, translation, 
and glide reflection. Finite objects can only have rotations, or reflections and rota-
tions (in an equal number). Patterns can have a little more flexibility in their com-
binations of the four symmetries but not as much as one would think—only seven 
symmetry types are possible in the case of border patterns and only 17 symmetry 
types are possible in the case of wallpaper patterns.
Conclusion
figurE 34 
n rotations. In terms of rotation symmetries, a wallpaper pattern can have (a) the 
identity only, (b) two rotations (identity and 180°), (c) three rotations (identity, 
120°, and 240°), (d) four rotations (identity, 90°, 180°, and 270°), and (e) six 
rotations (identity, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, and 300°). There are no other possibili-
ties. (Once again, note that a wallpaper pattern cannot have just five different 
rotations.)
n glide reflections. A wallpaper pattern can have (a) no glide reflections, (b) 
glide reflections in only one direction, (c) glide reflections in two nonparallel 
directions, (d) glide reflections in three nonparallel directions, (e) glide reflec-
tions in four nonparallel directions, and (f) glide reflections in six nonparallel 
directions. There are no other possibilities.
In the early 1900s, it was shown mathematically that there are only 17 possible 
symmetry types for wallpaper patterns. This is quite a surprising fact—it means that 
the hundreds and thousands of wallpaper patterns one can find at a decorating store 
all fall into just 17 different symmetry families.

 1 patterns Everywhere
Border patterns can be found in many objects from the real 
world—ribbons, wallpaper borders, and architectural friezes. 
Even ceramic pots and woven baskets exhibit border patterns 
(when the pattern goes around in a circle it can be unraveled 
as if it were going on a straight line). Likewise, wallpaper pat-
terns can be found in wallpapers, textiles, neckties, rugs, and 
gift-wrapping paper. Patterns are truly everywhere.
This project consists of two separate subprojects.
part 1. Find examples from the real world of each of the  seven 
possible border-pattern symmetry types. Do not use photo-
graphs from a book or designs you have just downloaded from 
some Web site. This part is not too hard, and it is a warm-up for 
Part 2, the real challenge.
part 2. Find examples from the real world of each of the 17 
wallpaper-pattern symmetry types. (The 17 symmetry types for 
wallpaper patterns are listed in The 17 Wallpaper Symmetry 
Types chart in the online Appendix in MyMathLab.*). The same 
rules apply as for Part 1.
Notes: (1) Your best bet is to look at wallpaper patterns and 
borders at a wallpaper store or gift-wrapping paper and ribbons 
at a paper store. You will have to do some digging—a few of 
the wallpaper-pattern symmetry types are hard to find. (2) For 
ideas, you may want to visit Steve Edwards’s excellent Web site 
Tiling Plane and Fancy at http://www2.spsu.edu/math/tile/index
.htm.
 2 three-dimensional rigid motions
For two-dimensional objects, we have seen that every rigid mo-
tion is of one of four basic types. For three-dimensional objects 
moving in three-dimensional space, there are six possible types of 
rigid motion. Specifically, every rigid motion in three-dimensional 
space is equivalent to a reflection, a rotation, a translation, a glide 
reflection, a rotary reflection, or a screw displacement.
Prepare a presentation on the six possible types of rigid 
motions in three-dimensional space. For each one give a precise 
definition of the rigid motion, describe its most important prop-
erties, and give illustrations as well as real-world examples.

 71. Rotations and translations are proper rigid motions. The given 
motion is an improper rigid motion (it reverses the clockwise- 
counterclockwise orientation). If the rigid motion were a reflection, 
then PP, RR, and QQ would all be perpendicular to the axis of 
reflection and, hence, would all be parallel. It must be a glide reflec-
tion (the only rigid motion left).

The Kinky Nature of Nature 
Romanesco broccoli (also known as Roman cauliflower and often called 
Romanesco for short) is an edible flower and a close cousin of both 
broccoli and cauliflower. Romanesco is not a staple of the American 
diet—if you are lucky, you might find it occasionally in the vegetable 
section of one of your better supermarkets—which is too bad: Romanesco 
is nutritious, delicious (milder and nuttier than cauliflower), and beautiful to 
behold. It is also kinky. Very, very kinky.

 inky is a word that means different things in different contexts, and 
in the context of this chapter we use “kinky” to mean the opposite of 
“smooth.” The kind of kinkiness exhibited by Romanesco is of particular 
interest to us because it is the result of a special property called self-similarity. Self-
similarity is the characteristic of an object that looks like parts of itself, and these parts 
in turn look like even smaller parts of themselves, and so on (at least for a while). Self-
similarity is an extremely useful property, and many things in nature have some form 
of it—trees, clouds, mountains, rivers, our system of veins and arteries, etc.
Whatever nature creates, man wants to imitate. 
By and large, this is a good idea (nature usually knows 
what it is doing), but imitating nature is easier said than 
done. How do you imitate the kinky structure of a tree, 
a cloud, or a mountain? The first step in this direction is 
the development of a new type of geometry called fractal 
geometry and the creation of super-kinky geometric shapes called fractals. These 
remarkable shapes are made possible only by incorporating self-similarity into the 
structure of their geometry. This chapter is an introduction to the basic ideas of 
fractal geometry.
The chapter is organized 
around a series of classic ex-
amples of geometric fractals—
the Koch snowflake (followed 
by a general discussion of self-
similarity) in Section 1, the Si-
erpinski gasket (followed by the 
chaos game) in Section 2, the 
twisted Sierpinski gasket in Sec-
tion 3, and the Mandelbrot set 
in Section 4. As we discuss each 
of these examples, we will ex-
plore the connection between 
fractal geometry and the orga-
nized kinkiness exhibited by 
many objects in nature.

Fractal Geometry 
Our first example of a geometric fractal is an object known as the Koch snowflake, 
named after the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch (1870–1954). Like other 
geometric fractals we will discuss in this chapter, the Koch snowflake is constructed 
by means of a recursive process, a process in which the same set of rules is applied 
repeatedly in an infinite feedback loop—the output at one stage becomes the input 
at the next stage. 
The construction of the Koch snowflake proceeds as follows:
n Start. Start with a shaded equilateral triangle [Fig. 1(a)]. We will refer to this 
starting triangle as the seed of the Koch snowflake. The size of the seed triangle 
is irrelevant, so for simplicity we will assume that the sides are of length 1.
n Step 1. To the middle third of each of the sides of the seed add an equilateral 
triangle with sides of length 1
3, as shown in Fig. 1(b). The result is the 12-sided 
“snowflake” shown in Fig. 1(c)—a shape just a tad kinkier than the seed tri-
angle.

n Step 2. To the middle third of each of the 12 sides of the “snowflake” in Step 1 
add an equilateral triangle with sides of length one-third the length of that side. 
The result is a “snowflake” with 48 sides 112 * 42, each of length 11
322 = 1
9, as 
shown in Fig. 2(a). (The snowflake got kinkier.)
 
 
For ease of reference, we will call the procedure of adding an equilateral 
triangle to the middle third of each side of the figure procedure KS. This will 
make the rest of the construction a lot easier to describe. Notice that every time 
we apply procedure KS the snowflake gets kinkier—each side “crinkles” into 
four new sides and the sides get shorter by a factor of one-third.
n Step 3. Apply procedure KS to the “snowflake” in Step 2. This gives the more 
elaborate “snowflake” shown in Fig. 2(b), with 192 sides 148 * 42, each of 
 
length 11
323 = 1
27.
n Step 4. Apply procedure KS to the “snowflake” in Step 3. This gives the 
“snowflake” shown in Fig. 2(c). (You definitely don’t want to do this by hand—
there are 192 tiny little equilateral triangles that are being added!)

n Steps 5, 6, etc. At each step apply procedure KS to the “snowflake” obtained in 
the previous step.
At every step of this recursive process the rules that define procedure KS gener-
ate a new “snowflake,” but after a while it’s hard to tell that there are any changes. 
There is already a very small difference between the snowflakes in Figs. 2(b) and 
(c), and after a few more steps the images become visually stable—to the naked eye 
there is no difference between one snowflake and the next. For all practical pur-
poses what we are seeing is a rendering of a Koch snowflake [Fig. 3(a)].
Because the Koch snowflake is constructed in an infinite sequence of steps, a 
perfect rendering of it is impossible—Fig. 3(a) is only an approximation. This is no 
reason to be concerned or upset—the Koch snowflake is an abstract shape that we 
can study and explore by looking at imperfect pictures of it (much like we do in high 
school geometry when we study circles even though it is impossible to draw a perfect 
circle).
n 
For a step-by-step view of the 
process that generates a Koch 
snowflake, see the applet Geometric 
Fractals in MyMathLab.*
The most “happening” part of the Koch snowflake is its boundary (that’s where 
all the kinkiness occurs), so it is often more convenient to only look at the boundary 
and forget about the interior. If we do that, we get the Koch curve (sometimes called 
the snowflake curve) shown in Fig. 3(b). From now on, our discussion will alternate 
between the Koch snowflake (a region, with an area) and the Koch curve (a closed 
curve, with a length).
One advantage of recursive processes is that they allow for very simple and ef-
ficient definitions, even when the objects being defined are quite complicated. The 
Koch curve, for example, is a fairly complicated shape, but we can define it in two 
lines using a form of shorthand we will call a replacement rule—a scale-independent 
rule that specifies how to substitute one piece for another.
Koch curve replacement rule:
n Start: Start with an equilateral triangle.
n replacement rule: In each step replace any line segment 
 with the “crin-
kled” version 
 .
One of the most remarkable facts about the Koch snowflake is that it occupies 
a relatively small area and yet its boundary is infinitely long—a notion that seems to 
defy common sense.

Fractal Geometry 
To compute the length of the boundary let’s first compute the perimeter of 
the “snowflakes” obtained in the first few steps of the construction (Fig. 4). The 
seed triangle has perimeter P0 = 3. In Step 1, each side of length 1 is replaced by
four sides of length 1
3 : The perimeter is P1 = 3 * 14
32 = 4. In Step 2, each side of length
1
3 is replaced by four sides of length 1
9 : The perimeter is P2 = 3 * 14
322 = 48
9 . As the
replacement process continues, at each step we replace a side by four sides that
are 1
3 as long. Thus, at any given step the perimeter p is 4
3 times the perimeter at the
preceding step. This implies that the perimeters keep growing with each step, and 
growing very fast indeed. After infinitely many steps the perimeter is infinite.

Computing the exact area of the Koch snowflake is considerably more difficult, 
and we will not discuss the details here, but it is not hard to convince oneself that the 
Koch snowflake has a finite area, not larger than the area of the circle that circum-
scribes the seed triangle (Fig. 5). Indeed, we can be much more specific: The area of
the Koch snowflake is exactly 
8
5 (or 1.6) times the area of the seed triangle.

Self-Similarity
The most important characteristic shared by the shapes and objects, which we will 
see in this chapter, is that they are all self-similar. In broad terms, we say that an 
object is self-similar when it is similar to some part of itself. In other words, parts of 
the object are similar to the whole object. The self-similarity can occur at many dif-
ferent scales and in many different ways, and we will discuss the many variations on 
the theme of self-similarity next.

Fractal Geometry 
We start with a closer look at our new friend, the Koch curve. Figure 
6(a) shows a section of the Koch curve. We do know that the curve is pretty 
kinky, but to get a better idea of how kinky it really is we will look at it with an 
imaginary microscope. When we choose to look at a little piece of the original 
curve and magnify it, we get a surprise (or maybe not)—nothing has changed! 
The little piece is an exact replica of the larger piece but at a smaller scale [Fig. 
6(b)]. And, if we crank up the magnification and choose to look at an even small-
er piece it happens again—we get a copy of the original piece at an even smaller 
scale [Fig. 6(c)]. Frustrated, we continue cranking the magnification and looking 
at smaller and smaller bits of the curve, but nothing changes—more of the same 
at smaller and smaller scales. Boring, you say? Not once you understand how 
useful this can be.

(b)
(c)
Figure 6 (a) A small piece of the Koch curve. (b) The piece in (a) magnified *9. 
(c) The same piece magnified *81.
The kind of self-similarity exhibited by the Koch curve has three key proper-
ties—it is exact, infinite, and universal.
n exact self-similarity. An object or shape has exact self-similarity if different parts 
of the object look exactly the same at different scales. (Using the microscope 
analogy, this means that as you crank up the microscope’s magnification you 
continue seeing parts that are identical in shape.)
n infinite self-similarity. An object or shape has infinite self-similarity if the self-
similarity occurs at infinitely many different scales. (This means that if you were 
able to continue cranking up your microscope’s magnification indefinitely, the 
self-similar parts would continue showing up indefinitely.)
n universal self-similarity. An object or shape has universal self-similarity if the 
self-similarity occurs in every part of the object. (Again using the microscope 
analogy, you don’t have to point the microscope in a specific direction—no mat-
ter where you zoom you will eventually find self-similar pieces.)
For a different perspective on self-similarity, let’s take another look at Roma-
nesco. We start with a full head of Romanesco [Fig. 7(a)]—for convenience, we will 
call it the “mother.” The mother is made up of a series of buds of various sizes (the 
“first generation”). Figure 7(b) is a close-up of some of the first generation buds at 
the center of the original picture. These buds all look very much like the mother 
but they are not identical to it. Let’s say that they are approximately (but not ex-
actly) self-similar. Figure 7(c) is a close-up of some of the first-generation buds. We 
can clearly see now the “second-generation” buds, looking just as Romanesque as 
the mother and the first-generation buds but not identical to any. The self-similar 
replication continues but only for another three generations. Figure 7(d) shows the 
“fifth generation,” and we can see that the self-similar replication is beginning to 
break down. These buds no longer look like the mother or like earlier generations. 
It is also worth noting that the buds of a Romanesco head are spatially arranged in 
a very special way—the first-generation buds form a spiral arrangement inside the 
401

Fractal Geometry 
mother, each second-generation bud is part of a spiral inside its parent bud, and so 
on. Because of this spiral arrangement, the self-similarity is not universal—it occurs 
only along certain directions.
What happened with the Romanesco head is the typical kind of self-similarity 
that can be found in nature—approximate, finite, and local (the alternatives to exact, 
infinite, and universal).
n Approximate self-similarity. An object or shape has approximate self-similarity 
if different parts of the object share the same structure as the whole object and 
look approximately (but not exactly) the same at different scales.
n Finite self-similarity. An object or shape has finite self-similarity if the self-similarity 
occurs at multiple scales but eventually stops.
n Local self-similarity. An object or shape has local self-similarity if the self-similarity 
occurs in some parts of the object but not everywhere.
We can find self-similarity in many shapes in nature: trees, leaves, lightning, 
seashells, rivers, mountains, clouds, our circulatory system, our lungs, etc. Figure 8  
illustrates a few examples of nature’s affinity for self-similar shapes. In all cases, the 
self-similarity is approximate, finite, and local, and for some unexplained reason, 
quite beautiful.
The appeal of self-similarity transcends natural shapes, and self-similarity is of-
ten used in man-made objects and images: Russian dolls, cake decorations, product 
labels, abstract art, and so on (Fig. 9). Typically, the implied message that these 
man-made creations try to convey is that the self-similar replication is infinite and 
that the images keep repeating forever at smaller and smaller scales, but obviously 
this is an illusion—the self-similarity is finite and has to stop after a few iterations (it 
is impossible for the human hand to draw or physically create an infinite repetition).

Fractal Geometry 
For infinite self-similarity we need to think in abstract, mathematical terms and 
create virtual objects and shapes (such as the Koch snowflake) that can only be seen 
in the mind’s eye. We will study several of these in the remainder of this chapter.
The Sierpinski Gasket and the Chaos Game
2
With the insight gained by our study of the Koch snowflake, we will now look at 
another well-known geometric fractal called the Sierpinski gasket, named after the 
Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski (1882–1969).
Just like with the Koch snowflake, the construction of the Sierpinski gasket 
starts with a solid triangle, but this time, instead of repeatedly adding smaller and 
smaller versions of the original triangle, we will remove them according to the fol-
lowing procedure:
n	 Start. Start with a seed—the solid triangle ABC [Fig. 10(a)].
n	 Step 1. Remove the triangle connecting the midpoints of the sides of the seed 
triangle. This gives the shape shown in Fig. 10(b)—consisting of three solid tri-
angles, each a half-scale version of the seed and a hole where the middle triangle 
used to be.
	
	
For convenience, we will call this process of hollowing out the middle tri-
angle of a solid triangle procedure SG.
n	 Step 2. Apply procedure SG to each of the three solid triangles in Fig.  
10(b). The result is the “gasket” shown in Fig. 10(c) consisting of nine solid tri-
angles, each at one-fourth the scale of the seed triangle, plus three small holes 
of the same size and one larger hole in the middle.
n	 Step 3. Apply procedure SG to each of the nine solid triangles in Fig. 10(c). The 
result is the “gasket” shown in Fig. 10(d) consisting of 27 solid triangles, each at 
one-eighth the scale of the original triangle, nine small holes of the same size, 
three medium-sized holes, and one large hole in the middle.
n	 Steps 4, 5, etc. Apply procedure SG to each solid triangle in the “gasket” ob-
tained in the previous step.

Figure 11 
After a few more steps the figure becomes visually stable—the naked eye cannot 
tell the difference between the gasket obtained at one step and the gasket  obtained 
at the next step. At this point we have a good rendering of the Sierpinski gasket it-
self. In your mind’s eye you can think of Fig. 11 as a picture of the Sierpinski gasket 
(in reality, it is the gasket obtained at Step 7 of the construction).
n 
A step-by-step construction of the 
Sierpinski gasket can be seen in 
the applet Geometric Fractals in 
MyMathLab.*
The Sierpinski gasket is clearly a fairly complicated geometric shape, and yet it 
can be defined in two lines using the following recursive replacement rule.
Sierpinski gasket replacement rule:
n Start: Start with a shaded seed triangle.
n replacement rule: In each step replace any solid triangle 
 with the “hollowed” 
version 
 .
Looking at Fig. 11, we might think that the Sierpinski gasket is made of a huge 
number of tiny triangles, but this is just an optical illusion—there are no solid tri-
angles in the Sierpinski gasket, just specks of the original triangle surrounded by a 
sea of white triangular holes. If we were to magnify any small part of the Sierpinski 
gasket [Fig. 12(a)], we would see more of the same—specks surrounded by white 
triangles [Fig. 12(b)]. This, of course, is another example of self-similarity. As with 
the Koch curve, the self-similarity of the Sierpinski gasket is exact, infinite, and uni-
versal.
As a geometric object existing in the plane, the Sierpinski gasket should have 
an area, but it turns out that its area is infinitesimally small, smaller than any posi-
tive quantity. Paradoxical as it may first seem, the mathematical formulation of this 
fact is that the Sierpinski gasket has zero area. At the same time, the boundary of 
the “gaskets” obtained at each step of the construction grows without bound, which 
implies that the Sierpinski gasket has an infinitely long boundary (see Exercises 21 
and 22).

The Chaos game
For a change of pace, we will now play a game of chance called the chaos game. All 
we need to play the chaos game is a single six-sided die and an arbitrary triangle with 
vertices labeled A, B, and C [Fig. 13(a)].

n 
For an easy way to play the chaos 
game online see the applet Geomet-
ric Fractals in MyMathLab.*
The purpose of the die is to randomly choose one of the three vertices of the 
triangle with equal probability. We can do this in many different ways. For example, 
if we roll a 1 or a 2, we choose A; if we roll a 3 or a 4, we choose B; and if we roll a 5 
or a 6, we choose C. Here now are the rules for the chaos game:
n Start. Roll the die and mark the chosen vertex. Say we roll a 5. This puts us at 
vertex C [Fig. 13(b)].
n Step 1. Roll the die again. Say we roll a 2, so the new chosen vertex is A. We now 
move to the point M1 halfway between the previous position C and the winning 
vertex A. Mark the new position M1 [Fig. 13(c)].
n Step 2. Roll the die again, and move to the point halfway between the last position 
M1 and the new chosen vertex. [Say we roll a 3—the move then is to M2 halfway 
between M1 and B as shown in Fig. 13(d).] Mark a point at the new position M2.
n Steps 3, 4, etc. Continue rolling the die, each time moving to a point halfway 
between the last position and the chosen vertex and marking that point.

Fractal Geometry 
What happens after you roll the die a few times? Figure 14(a) shows the pattern 
of points after 50 rolls of the die—just a bunch of scattered dots—but when you 
continue rolling the die, a pattern emerges [Fig. 14(b), (c), and (d)]: the unmistak-
able tracks of a Sierpinski gasket! The longer we play the chaos game, the more the 
track of points left behind looks like a Sierpinski gasket. After 100,000 rolls of the 
die, it would be impossible to tell the difference between the two. (You can convince 
yourself by playing the chaos game with the applet Geometric Fractals available in 
MyMathLab.)

This is a truly surprising turn of events. The chaos game is ruled by the laws of 
chance; thus, we would expect that essentially a random pattern of points would be 
generated. Instead, we get an approximation to the Sierpinski gasket, and the longer 
we play the chaos game, the better the approximation gets. An important implica-
tion of this is that it is possible to generate geometric fractals using simple rules 
based on the laws of chance.

The Twisted Sierpinski Gasket
3
Our next construction is a variation of the original Sierpinski gasket. For lack of a 
better name, we will call it the twisted Sierpinski gasket.
The construction starts out exactly like the one for the regular Sierpinski 
gasket, with a solid seed triangle [Fig. 15(a)] from which we cut out the middle 
triangle, [whose vertices we will call M, N, and L as shown in Fig. 15(b)]. The 
next move (which we will call the “twist”) is new. Each of the points M, N, and L 
is moved a small amount in a random direction—as if jolted by an earthquake—
to new positions M, N, and L. One possible resulting shape is shown in Fig. 
15(c).

n Twist. Translate each of the midpoints of the sides by a small random amount 
and in a random direction [Fig. 15(c)].
When we repeat procedure TSG in an infinite recursive process, we get the 
twisted Sierpinski gasket:
n Start. Start with a solid seed triangle [Fig. 16(a)].
n Step 1. Apply procedure TSG to the seed triangle. This gives the “twisted gas-
ket” shown in Fig. 16(b), with three twisted solid triangles and a triangular hole 
in the middle.
n Step 2. To each of the three solid triangles in Fig. 16(b) apply procedure TSG. 
The result is the “twisted gasket” shown in Fig. 16(c), consisting of nine twisted 
solid triangles and four triangular holes of various sizes.
n Steps 3, 4, etc. Apply procedure TSG to each shaded triangle in the “twisted 
gasket” obtained in the previous step.
We find approximate self-similarity most commonly in nature (trees, rivers, 
mountains, etc.), but the twisted Sierpinski gasket is the rare example of a man-
made geometric shape having approximate self-similarity—when we magnify any 
part of the gasket we see similar, but not identical, images (Fig. 18).

eye. Notice the striking resemblance to a snow-covered mountain. With a few of 
the standard tools of computer graphics—color, lighting, and shading—a twisted 
Sierpinski gasket can be morphed to give a very realistic-looking mountain. In Figs.

erated image created using a three-dimensional version of the twisted Sierpinski

The Mandelbrot Set
4
In this section we will introduce one of the most interesting and beautiful geometric 
fractals ever created, an object called the Mandelbrot set after the Polish-American 
mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. Some of the mathematics behind the Mandel-
brot set goes a bit beyond the level of this text, so we will describe the overall idea 
and try not to get bogged down in the details.
We will start this section with a brief visual tour. The Mandelbrot set is the 
shape shown in Fig. 19(a), a strange-looking blob of black. Using a strategy we will 
describe later, the different regions outside the Mandelbrot set can be colored ac-
cording to their mathematical properties, and when this is done [Fig. 19(b)], the 
Mandelbrot set comes to life like a switched-on neon sign.
In the wild imagination of some, the Mandelbrot set looks like some sort of bug—
an exotic extraterrestrial flea. The “flea” is made up of a heart-shaped body (called a 
cardioid), a head, and an antenna coming out of the middle of the head. A careful look 
at Fig. 19 shows that the flea has many “smaller fleas that prey on it,” but we can only 
begin to understand the full extent of the infestation when we look at Fig. 20(a)—a

the view around the boundary even further, we can see that these secondary fleas 
also have fleas that “prey” on them [Figs. 20(b) and (c)], and further magnification 
would show this repeats itself ad infinitum. Clearly, Jonathan Swift was onto some-
thing!
Looking carefully at Figs. 20(a), (b), and (c), it appears that the Mandelbrot 
set has some strange form of infinite and approximate self-similarity—at infinitely 
many levels of magnification we see the same theme—similar but never identical

fleas surrounded by similar smaller fleas. At the same time, we can see that there is 
tremendous variation in the regions surrounding the individual fleas. The images we 
see are a peek into a psychedelic coral reef—a world of strange “urchins” and “sea-
horse tails” in Fig. 20(b), “anemone” and “starfish” in Fig. 20(c). Further magnifica-
tion shows an even more exotic and beautiful landscape. Figure 21(a) is a close-up of 
one of the seahorse tails in Fig. 20(b). A further close-up of a section of Fig. 21(a) is 
shown in Fig. 21(b), and an even further magnification of it is seen in Fig. 21(c), re-
vealing a tiny copy of the Mandelbrot set surrounded by a beautiful arrangement of 
swirls, spirals, and seahorse tails. [The magnification for Fig. 21(c) is approximately 
10,000 times the original.]
What we see in these pictures is a truly amazing form of approximate self- 
similarity—anywhere we choose to look we will find (if we crank up the magni-
fication enough) copies of the original Mandelbrot set, always surrounded by an 
infinitely changing, but always stunning, background. The infinite, approximate self-
similarity of the Mandelbrot set manages to blend infinite repetition and infinite 
variety, creating a landscape as consistently exotic and diverse as nature itself.
Complex Numbers and Mandelbrot Sequences
How does this magnificent mix of beauty and complexity called the Mandelbrot set 
come about? Incredibly, the Mandelbrot set itself can be described mathematically 
by a recursive process involving simple computations with complex numbers.
You may recall having seen complex numbers in high school algebra. Among other 
things, complex numbers allow us to take square roots of negative numbers and solve 
quadratic equations of any kind. The basic building block for complex numbers is the 
number i = 1-1. Starting with i we can build all other complex numbers using the gen-
eral form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. For example, 3 + 2i, -0.125 + 0.75i, 
and even 1 + 0i = 1 or -0.75 + 0i = -0.75. Just like real numbers, complex numbers 
can be added, multiplied, divided, and squared. (For a quick review of the basic opera-
tions with complex numbers, see Exercises 41 through 44.)
For our purposes, the most important fact about complex numbers is that they 
have a geometric interpretation: The complex number 1a + bi2 
can be identified with the point 1a, b2 in a Cartesian coordinate 
system, as shown in Fig. 22. This identification means that every 
complex number can be thought of as a point in the plane and 
that operations with complex numbers have geometric interpre-
tations (see Exercises 45 and 46).
The key concept in the construction of the Mandelbrot set is 
that of a Mandelbrot sequence. A Mandelbrot sequence is an in-
finite sequence of complex numbers that starts with an arbitrary 
complex number s we call the seed, and then each successive 
term in the sequence is obtained recursively by adding the seed 
s to the square of the previous term. Figure 23 shows a schematic 
illustration of how a generic Mandelbrot sequence is generated. 
[Notice that the only complex number operations involved are 
squaring a complex number and adding two complex numbers. 
If you know how to do these two things, you can compute Man-
delbrot sequences.]

Much like a Koch snowflake and a Sierpinski gasket, a Mandelbrot sequence 
can be defined by means of a recursive rule.
411

Fractal Geometry 
Mandelbrot sequence recursive rule:
n Start: Choose an arbitrary complex number s. We will call s the seed of the 
Mandelbrot sequence. Set the seed s to be the initial term of the sequence 1s0 = s2.
n recursive rule: To find the next term in the sequence, square the preceding term 
and add the seed 3sN+1 = 1sN22 + s4.
The following set of examples will illustrate the different patterns of growth 
exhibited by Mandelbrot sequences as we vary the seeds. These different pat-
terns of growth are going to tell us how to generate the Mandelbrot set itself 
and the incredible images that we saw in our visual tour. The idea goes like this: 
Each point in the Cartesian plane is a complex number and thus the seed of some 
Mandelbrot sequence. The pattern of growth of that Mandelbrot sequence de-
termines whether the seed is inside the Mandelbrot set (black point) or outside 
(nonblack point). In the case of nonblack points, the color assigned to the point 
is also determined by the pattern of growth of the corresponding Mandelbrot 
sequence. Let’s try it.
exAMpLe 1 
eSCApiNg MANdeLBroT SequeNCeS
Figure 24 shows the first few terms of the Mandelbrot sequence with seed s = 1. 
(Since integers and decimals are also complex numbers, they make perfectly accept-
able seeds.) The pattern of growth of this Mandelbrot sequence is clear—the terms 
are getting larger and larger, and they are doing so very quickly. Geometrically, it 
means that the points in the Cartesian plane that represent the numbers in this se-
quence are getting farther and farther away from the origin. For this reason, we call 
this sequence an escaping Mandelbrot sequence.

In general, when the points that represent the terms of a Mandelbrot se-
quence move farther and farther away from the origin, we will say that the Man-
delbrot sequence is escaping. The basic rule that defines the Mandelbrot set is 
that seeds of escaping Mandelbrot sequences are not in the Mandelbrot set and 
must be assigned some color other than black. While there is no specific rule that 
tells us what color should be assigned, the overall color palette is based on how 
fast the sequence is escaping. The typical approach is to use “hot” colors such as 
reds, yellows, and oranges for seeds that escape slowly and “cool” colors such as 
blues and purples for seeds that escape quickly. The seed s = 1, for example, es-
capes very quickly, and the corresponding point in the Cartesian plane is painted 
blue (Fig. 25).
Figure 25 The seed s = 1 is 
assigned a “cool” color (blue).

Figure 26 shows the first few terms of the Mandelbrot sequence with seed s = -1. 
The pattern that emerges here is also clear—the numbers in the sequence alternate 
between 0 and -1. In this case, we say that the Mandelbrot sequence is periodic.

Fractal Geometry 
In general, a Mandelbrot sequence is said to be periodic if at some point the 
numbers in the sequence start repeating themselves in a cycle. When the Mandelbrot 
sequence is periodic, the seed is a point of the Mandelbrot set and, thus, is assigned 
the color black (Fig. 27).
Figure 27 The seed s = -1 
is in the Mandelbrot set (black 
point).

Figure 29 The seed s = -0.75 is

In general, when the terms in a Mandelbrot sequence get closer and closer to a 
fixed complex number a, we say that a is an attractor for the sequence or, equiva-
lently, that the sequence is attracted to a. Just as with periodic sequences, when a 
Mandelbrot sequence is attracted, the seed s is in the Mandelbrot set and is colored 
black (Fig. 29).
So far, all our examples have been based on rational number seeds (mostly to 
keep things simple), but the truly interesting cases occur when the seeds are com-
plex numbers. The next two examples deal with complex number seeds.

Figure 28 shows the first few terms in the Mandelbrot sequence with seed s = -0.75. 
Here the growth pattern is not obvious, and additional terms of the sequence are 
needed. Further computation (a calculator will definitely come in handy) shows that 
as we go farther and farther out in this sequence, the terms get closer and closer to 
the value -0.5 (see Exercise 58). In this case, we will say that the sequence is at-
tracted to the value -0.5.

In this example we will examine the growth of the Mandelbrot sequence with seed 
s = i. Starting with s = i (and using that i2 = -1), we get s1 = i2 + i = -1 + i. If we 
now square s1  and add i, we get s2 = 1 -1 + i22 + i = -i, and repeating the pro-
cess gives s3 = 1 -i22 + i = -1 + i. At this point we notice that s3 = s1, which implies 
s4 = s2, s5 = s1, and so on (Fig. 30). This, of course, means that this Mandelbrot se-
quence is periodic, with its terms alternating between the complex numbers -1 + i 
(odd terms) and -i (even terms).

The key conclusion from the preceding computations is that the seed i is a black 
point inside the Mandelbrot set (Fig. 31).

plex attractors.

In this example we examine the growth of the Mandelbrot sequence with seed 
s = -0.125 + 0.75i. The first few terms of the Mandelbrot sequence are shown. 
We leave it to the enterprising reader to check these calculations. (You will need 
a scientific calculator that handles complex numbers. If you don’t have one, you 
can download a free virtual calculator for doing complex number arithmetic from  
http://www.calc3D.com or other similar Web sites.)
 s0 = -0.125 + 0.75i
  s1 = -0.671875 + 0.5625i
  s2 = 0.0100098 - 0.00585938i
 s3 = -0.124934 + 0.749883i
  s4 = -0.671716 + 0.562628i
  s5 = 0.00965136 - 0.00585206i
 s6 = -0.124941 + 0.749887i
  s7 = -0.67172 + 0.562617i
  s8 = 0.00967074 - 0.00584195i
We can see that the terms in this Mandelbrot sequence are complex numbers 
that essentially cycle around in sets of three and are approaching three different 
attractors. Since this Mandelbrot sequence is attracted, the seed s = -0.125 + 0.75i 
represents another point in the Mandelbrot set.
The Mandelbrot Set
Given all the previous examples and discussion, a formal definition of the Mandelbrot 
set using seeds of Mandelbrot sequences sounds incredibly simple: If the Mandelbrot 
sequence is periodic or attracted, the seed is a point of the Mandelbrot set and assigned 
the color black; if the Mandelbrot sequence is escaping, the seed is a point outside the 
Mandelbrot set and assigned a color that depends on the speed with which the sequence 
is escaping (hot colors for slowly escaping sequences, cool colors for quickly escaping 
sequences). There are a few technical details that we omitted, but essentially these are 
the key ideas behind the amazing pictures that we saw in Figs. 20 and 21. In addition, of 
course, a computer is needed to carry out the computations and generate the images.
Because the Mandelbrot set provides a bounty of aesthetic returns for a rela-
tively small mathematical investment, it has become one of the most popular math-
ematical playthings of our time. Hundreds of software programs that allow one to 
explore the beautiful landscapes surrounding the Mandelbrot set are available, and 
many of these programs are freeware. You can find plenty of these by Googling the 
term “Mandelbrot set.” There are also many exploratory zooms into the depths of 
the Mandelbrot set available in YouTube.
The study of fractals and their geometry has become a hot mathematical topic. It 
is a part of mathematics that combines complex and interesting theories, beautiful 
graphics, and extreme relevance to the real world. In this chapter we only scratched 
the surface of this deep and rich topic.
The word fractal (from the Latin fractus, meaning “broken up or fragmented”) 
was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot in the mid-1970s to describe objects as diverse as 
the Koch curve, the Sierpinski gasket, the twisted Sierpinski gasket, and the Man-
delbrot set, as well as many shapes in nature, such as clouds, mountains, trees, rivers, 
and Romanesco broccoli.
These objects share one key characteristic: They all have some form of self- 
similarity. (Self-similarity is not the only defining characteristic of a fractal. Others, 
such as fractional dimension, are discussed in Project 1.) There is a striking differ-
ence between the kinky geometry of self-similar shapes and the smooth geometry of 
traditional lines, circles, spheres, and so on. This difference is most apparent when we 
compare the look and texture of natural objects with those of man-made objects.

Fractal Geometry 
Old-school, traditional geometry was developed by the Greeks about 2000 years 
ago and passed on to us essentially unchanged. It was (and still is) a great triumph of 
the human mind, and it has allowed us to develop much of our technology, engineer-
ing, architecture, and so on. As a tool and a language for modeling and representing 
nature, however, the smooth geometry of the Greeks has by and large been a fail-
ure. The discovery of fractal geometry seems to have given science the right math-
ematical language to overcome this failure and, thus, promises to be one of the great 
achievements of twentieth-century mathematics. Today fractal geometry is used to 
study the patterns of clouds and how they affect the weather, to diagnose the pat-
tern of contractions of a human heart, to design more efficient cell phone antennas, 
and to create some of the otherworldly computer graphics and special effects that 
animate many of the latest science fiction movies.

has sides of length 81 cm. Let M denote the number of sides,

Exercises 5 through 8 refer to a variation of the Koch snowflake 
called the quadratic Koch fractal. The construction of the qua-
dratic Koch fractal is similar to that of the Koch snowflake, but it 
uses squares instead of equilateral triangles as the shape’s build-
ing blocks. The following recursive construction rule defines the 
quadratic Koch fractal:
Quadratic Koch Fractal
n Start. Start with a solid seed square [Fig. 32(a)].
n Step 1. Attach a smaller square (sides one-third the length of 
the sides of the seed square) to the middle third of each side 
[Fig. 32(b)].
n Step 2. Attach a smaller square (sides one-third the length of 
the sides of the previous side to the middle third of each side 
[Fig. 32(c)]. (Call this procedure QKF.)

Exercises 41 through 46 are a review of complex number arithme-
tic. Recall that (1) to add two complex numbers you simply add 
the real parts and the imaginary parts: e.g., 12 + 3i2 + 15 + 2i2 = 
7 + 5i; (2) to multiply two complex numbers you multiply them 
as if they were polynomials and use the fact that i 2 = -1: e.g., 
12 + 3i215 + 2i2 = 10 + 4i + 15i + 6i2 = 4 + 19i. Finally, if you 
know how to multiply two complex numbers then you also know 
how to square them, since 1a + bi22 = 1a + bi21a + bi2.
 41. Simplify each expression.

Exercises 37 through 40 refer to a variation of the chaos game. In 
this game you start with a square ABCD with sides of length 27 
as shown in Fig. 39 and a fair die that you will roll many times. 
When you roll a 1, choose vertex A; when you roll a 2, choose ver-
tex B; when you roll a 3, choose vertex C; and when you roll a 4 
choose vertex D. (When you roll a 5 or a 6, disregard the roll and 
roll again.) A sequence of rolls will generate a sequence of points 
P1, P2, P3, c inside or on the boundary of the square according 
to the following rules.
n Start. Roll the die. Mark the chosen vertex and call it P1.
n Step 1. Roll the die again. From P1 move two-thirds of the 
way toward the new chosen vertex. Mark this point and call 
it P2.
n Steps 2, 3, etc. Each time you roll the die, mark the point 
two-thirds of the way between the previous point and the 
chosen vertex.
 37. Using graph paper, find the points P1, P2, P3, and P4 cor-
responding to
 
(a) the sequence of rolls 4, 2, 1, 2.
 
(b) the sequence of rolls 3, 2, 1, 2.
 
(c) the sequence of rolls 3, 3, 1, 1.

n Start. Start with a solid seed cube [Fig. 40(a)].
n Step 1. Subdivide the seed cube into 27 equal subcubes and 
remove the central cube and the six cubes in the centers of 
each face. This leaves a “sponge” consisting of 20 solid sub-
cubes, as shown in Fig. 40(b).
n Step 2. Subdivide each solid subcube into 27 subcubes and 
remove the central cube and the six cubes in the centers of

Fractal Geometry 
 1 Fractal dimension
The dimensions of a line segment, a square, and a cube are, as 
we all learned in school, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. But what is the 
dimension of the Sierpinski gasket?
The line segment of size 4 shown in Fig. 41(a) is made of 
four smaller copies of itself each scaled down by a factor of four; 
the square shown in Fig. 41(b) is made of 16 = 42 smaller cop-
ies of itself each scaled down by a factor of four; and the cube 
shown in Fig. 41(c) is made of 64 = 43 smaller copies of itself 
each scaled down by a factor of four. In all these cases, if N is the 
number of smaller copies of the object reduced by a scaling fac-
tor S, the dimension D is the exponent to which we need to raise 
S to get N (i.e., N = SD). If we apply the same argument to the 
Sierpinski gasket shown in Fig. 41(d), we see that the Sierpinski 
gasket is made of N = 3 smaller copies of itself and that each 
copy has been reduced by a scaling factor S = 2. If we want to 
be consistent, the dimension of the Sierpinski gasket should be 
the exponent D in the equation 3 = 2D. To solve for D you have 
to use logarithms. When you do, you get D =
log 3
log 2. Crazy but 
true: The dimension of the Sierpinski gasket is not a whole 
number, not even a rational number. It is the irrational number 
log 3
log 2 (about 1.585)!
For a geometric fractal with exact self-similarity, we will 
define its dimension as D =
log N
log S, where N is the number of self-
similar pieces that the parent fractal is built out of and S is the 
scale by which the pieces are reduced (if the pieces are one-half 
the size of the parent fractal S = 2, if the pieces are one-third the 
size of the parent fractal S = 3, and so on).
In this project you should discuss the meaning and impor-
tance of the concept of dimension as it applies to geometric frac-
tals having exact self-similarity.
 3 Book review: The Fractal Murders
If you enjoy mystery novels, this project is for you.
The Fractal Murders by Mark Cohen (Muddy Gap Press, 
2002) is a whodunit with a mathematical backdrop. In addition 
to the standard elements of a classic murder mystery (including 
a brilliant but eccentric detective), this novel has a fractal twist: 
The victims are all mathematicians doing research in the field of 
fractal geometry.
Read the novel and write a review of it. Include in your re-
view a critique of both the literary and the mathematical merits 
of the book. To get some ideas as to how to write a good book 
review, you should check out the New York Times Book Review 
section, which appears every Sunday in the New York Times 
(www.nytimes.com).
 4 Fractal Antennas
One of the truly innovative practical uses of fractals is in the de-
sign of small but powerful antennas that go inside wireless com-
munication devices such as cell phones, wireless modems, and 
GPS receivers. The application of fractal geometry to antenna 
design follows from the discovery in 1999 by radio astronomers 
Nathan Cohen and Robert Hohlfeld of Boston University that 
an antenna that has a self-similar shape has the ability to work 
equally well at many different frequencies of the radio spectrum.
Write a paper discussing the application of the concepts of 
fractal geometry to the design of antennas.

 2 Fractals and Music
The hallmark of a fractal shape is the property of self-similarity—
there are themes that repeat themselves (either exactly or  
approximately) at many different scales. This type of repetition 
also works in music, and the application of fractal concepts to 
musical composition has produced many intriguing results.
Write a paper discussing the connections between fractals 
and music.

Tales of Rabbits and Gnomons
Fib retracements, arcs and fans, time zones, Elliott waves. Surfer’s 
talk? No, Wall Street talk. All of the these terms describe some of 
the technical tools used by “chartists”—sophisticated traders who use 
the past up-and-down patterns in the chart of a stock market com-
modity to predict how the stock will perform in the future. Chartists 
live and die by their predictions: An accurate prediction is golden; 
a bad prediction can spell ruin. So it is quite remarkable that some 
of the most technical tools used by financial traders to predict market 
prices originated, more than 800 years ago, with, of all things, the 
behavior of a bunch of prolific bunny rabbits.

 ewind the clock to the year 1202. That’s the year that a young Italian  
mathematician named Leonardo Pisano, known to the world as  
Fibonacci, published a book called Liber Abaci (literally translated as
“The Book of Computation”). In Liber Abaci, Fibonacci introduced to the Europe 
of the Middle Ages the Hindu numerals and the Arabic algorithms for doing arith-
metic and basic algebra—basically all of the school mathematics of today.
Because of its scope and influence, Liber Abaci was one of the most important 
books in the history of mathematics, but ironically, Fibonacci’s modern fame (and the 
reason Wall Street traders talk about Fibonacci time zones and Fibonacci analysis) is a 
single example in the book involving a fairly simple rabbit–breeding problem:
A certain man put a pair of rabbits in a place surrounded in all sides by a wall. 
How many pairs of rabbits can be produced from that pair in a year if it is sup-
posed that every month each pair begets a new pair, which from the second month 
on becomes productive?
The numbers that give the general solution to this problem are now called the Fibo-
nacci numbers, and, as they say, the rest is history.
This chapter starts by visiting Fibonacci’s rabbit-breeding problem, followed by 
an introduction to the Fibonacci numbers and some of their mathematical proper-
ties. In Section 2 we introduce and discuss the golden ratio, an important irratio-
nal number closely connected to the Fibonacci numbers and playing a significant 
role in art, architecture, music, and 
mathematics (of course!). In Section 
3 we introduce gnomons—no, they 
are not little men living in trees in the 
forest—and look at various examples 
of geometric gnomons. In Section 4 
we combine the different concepts 
introduced in the earlier sections— 
Fibonacci numbers, the golden ratio, 
gnomons, and gnomonic growth to illus-
trate the mechanisms by which nature 
generates some of its beautiful spirals.

Fibonacci  Numbers and the Golden Ratio
We start this section with a discussion of the Fibonacci rabbit problem.

Fibonacci’s Rabbits REvisitEd
The key elements of Fibonacci’s rabbit problem are as follows:
n start. The population count starts with one pair of baby rabbits 1P0 = 12. 
[Note: The rabbit count is by pairs, and each pair is assumed to be a male and 
a female.]
n month 1. One month later the original pair is mature and able to produce off-
spring, but there is still one pair of rabbits: P1 = 1.
n month 2. The original pair produces a baby pair. There are now two pairs (one 
baby pair plus the parent pair): P2 = 1 + 1 = 2.
n month 3. The original pair produces another baby pair. There are now three 
pairs [the two pairs from the previous month (now both mature) plus the new 
baby pair]: P3 = 2 + 1 = 3.
n month 4. The two mature pairs in the previous month both have offspring. 
There are now five pairs [the three pairs from the previous month plus two new 
baby pairs]: P4 = 3 + 2 = 5.
n month 5. The three mature pairs in the previous month all have offspring. There 
are now eight pairs [the five pairs from the previous month plus three new baby 
pairs]: P4 = 5 + 3 = 8.
As long as the rabbits continue doing their thing and don’t die, the pat-
tern will continue: Each month the population will consist of the population 
in the previous month (mature pairs) plus the population in the previous 
previous month (baby pairs). It’s a lot easier to express the idea in math-
ematical notation:
n month N. PN = PN-1 + PN-2.
The month-by-month sequence for the growth of the rabbit population is 1, 1, 2, 
3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . . .
If we forget about rabbits and think of the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . . as 
just an infinite sequence of numbers, we have what almost everyone calls the Fibo-
nacci sequence.
n Fibonacci sequence (infinite list form). The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, . . . .
The terms of this sequence are called the Fibonacci numbers. (The conventional 
notation is to use FN to describe the Nth Fibonacci number and to start the count at 
F1, so we write F1 = 1, F2 = 1, F3 = 2, F4 = 3, etc.)
n Fibonacci numbers (recursive formula). Starting with F3, the Fibonacci numbers 
are given by the recursive formula FN = FN-1 + FN-2. (The first two numbers are 
by definition F1 = 1 and F2 = 1).
The recursive formula makes it very easy to find any Fibonacci number, as long 
as you know all the Fibonacci numbers that come before it. If you don’t, you may 
have a problem.

Fibonacci numbERs GEt biG Fast
Suppose you were given the following choice: You can have $100 billion or a sum 
equivalent to F100 pennies. Which one would you choose? Surely, this is a no brainer— 
how could you pass on the $100 billion? (By the way, that much money would make 
you considerably richer than Bill Gates.) But before you make a rash decision, let’s 
see if we can figure out the dollar value of the second option. To do so, we need to 
compute F100.
How could one find the value of F100? With a little patience (and a calculator) 
we could use the recursive formula for the Fibonacci numbers as a “crank” that we 
repeatedly turn to ratchet our way up the Fibonacci sequence: From the seeds F1 and 
F2 we computeF3, then use F3 and F2 to compute F4, and so on. If all goes well, after 
many turns of the crank (we will skip the details) you will eventually get to
F97 = 83,621,143,489,848,422,977
and
F98 = 135,301,852,344,706,746,049
One more turn of the crank gives
F99 = F98 + F97 = 218,922,995,834,555,169,026
and the last turn gives
F100 = F99 + F98 = 354,224,848,179,261,915,075
Thus, the F100 cents can be rounded nicely to $3,542,248,481,792,619,150. How 
much money is that? If you take $100 billion for yourself and then divide what’s 
left evenly among every man, woman, and child on Earth (about 6.7 billion people), 
each person would get more than $500 million!
The most obvious lesson to be drawn from Example 2 is that Fibonacci numbers 
grow very large very quickly. A more subtle lesson (less obvious because we cheated 
in Example 2 and skipped most of the work) is that computing Fibonacci numbers 
using the recursive formula takes an enormous amount of effort (each turn of the 
crank involves just one addition, but as we noted, the numbers being added get very 
large very quickly).
Is there a more convenient way to compute Fibonacci numbers—without the 
need to repeatedly turn the crank in the recursive formula? Yes and no. In 1736 
Leonhard Euler (the same Euler behind the namesake theorems) discovered a for-
mula for the Fibonacci numbers that does not rely on previous Fibonacci numbers. 
The formula was lost and rediscovered 100 years later by French mathematician 
and astronomer Jacques Binet, who somehow ended up getting all the credit, as the 
formula is now known as Binet’s formula. Now come the bad news.

Admittedly, Binet’s original formula is quite complicated and intimidating, 
and even with a good calculator you might have trouble finding an exact value 
when N is large, but there is a simplified version of the formula that makes the 
calculations a bit easier. In this simplified version we essentially disregard the 
second half of the numerator (it is a very small number) and make up for it by 
rounding to the nearest integer.

Binet’s simplified formula is an explicit formula (we don’t have to know the  
previous Fibonacci numbers to use it), but it only makes sense to use it to compute 
very large Fibonacci numbers (for smaller Fibonacci numbers you are much better 
off using the recursive formula). For example, if you need to find F100 you might 
consider using Binet’s simplified formula. To do so you will need a good calculator 
that can handle fairly large numbers. (A very good free online calculator that can 
handle very large numbers is web2.0calc, available at http://web2.0calc.com).

The key step is to compute the number inside the double square brackets. The

input prior to the calculation; Fig. 1(b) shows the answer given by web2.0calc. The 
last step is rounding the answer to the nearest integer, but in this case the calculator 
shows no decimal part to the answer, so no rounding is needed. We are done:

Fibonacci numbers in nature
One of the major attractions of the Fibonacci numbers is how often they show up 
in natural organisms, particularly flowers and plants that grow as spirals. The petal 
counts of most varieties of daisies are Fibonacci numbers—most often 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 
34, or 55 (but giant daisies with 89 petals also exist). 
Figure 2 shows three varieties of daisies with 13, 21, and 34 petals, respec-
tively. The bracts of a typical pinecone are arranged in 5, 8, and 13 spiraling rows  
depending on the direction you count [Figs. 3(a) and (b)]; and the seeds on a sun-
flower head are arranged in 21 and 34 spiraling rows [Figs. 3(c) and (d)]. Why Fibo-
nacci numbers? It is a bit of a mystery, but definitely related to the spiraling nature 
of the growth. We will come back to spiral growth and the connection with Fibo-
nacci numbers in the last section of this chapter.

Fibonacci  Numbers and the Golden Ratio
In this section we will introduce a remarkable number known as the golden ratio 
(sometimes also called the golden mean or the golden section). We will use the 
Greek letter f (“phi”; pronounced “fi” with a long “i”) to denote this special ir-
rational number.
Irrational numbers are numbers that have an infinite, nonrepeating decimal ex-
pansion. This is not an actual definition (a proper mathematical definition is quite 
complicated and beyond the scope of this text), but it will serve our purposes for

thE divinE pRopoRtion
Imagine that the line segment in Fig. 4(a) represents some undefined unit—a build-
ing, a work of art, a musical composition, whatever. This unit is to be split into 
two unequal sections in a nice, aesthetically pleasing and balanced proportion.  
Figure 4(b) shows a split that most of us would consider pretty unbalanced—the 
larger piece is too large and out of proportion in relation to the shorter piece. 
What kind of split would make for an ideal proportion? The ancient Greeks—
masters of both geometry and aesthetics—came up with a very clever answer: Make 
the split in such a way that the ratio of the bigger piece to the smaller piece is equal to 
the ratio of the whole unit to the bigger piece. They called this proportion the divine 
proportion. 
If we let B and S stand for the sizes of the bigger and smaller pieces respectively 
[Fig. 4(c)], the divine proportion is satisfied when B

To find all numbers with the property that squaring the number is the same as add-
ing one to it we set up the quadratic equation x2 = x + 1. Solving this equation in-
volves the use of the quadratic formula—standard fare in high school algebra. (For 
a review of the quadratic formula, see Exercises 25 through 28.)
To solve the equation we first rewrite it in the form x2 - x - 1 = 0. The two 
solutions are

  -0.6180339887. Both app-
roximations are accurate to 10 decimal places.
Notice that the two solutions appear to have identical decimal parts. This is not 
a coincidence, since one is positive, the other is negative, and their sum equals 1 [see 
Exercise 25(b)]. It follows that the negative solution can be written as 1 - f.
Our next example illustrates why the golden property is relevant to our discussion.
the moment. While p is undoubtedly the best known of all irrational numbers, 
the easiest place to find a mother lode of irrational numbers is to look at the square 
roots of positive integers: When a positive integer is not a perfect square its square 
root is an irrational number. So for the record, 12, 13, 15, 16, and 17 are all ex-
amples of irrational numbers.
Irrational numbers don’t mix well with rational numbers. Say you take 17, add 
1 to it, and then divide the result by 2. What do you have? You have another irratio-
nal number, but there is no way to write it as a single numerical entity—it is simply 
“the number” 
1 + 27
2
. There is one exception to this situation—the number 
1 + 25

. 
This number is so special and important that it has its own symbol and name. This 
number is, in fact, the golden ratio f.
n the Golden Ratio. The golden ratio is the irrational number f =
1 + 25

. A decimal 
 
approximation for f accurate to 10 decimal places is f  1.6180339887. (For 
the purposes of memorization, f  1.618 is a convenient shortcut.)
What is it that makes the golden ratio such a special number? There are several 
different explanations, but in one way or another they all fall back to the following 
fact: f2 = f + 1. For ease of reference we call this the golden property.
n the Golden property. f2 = f + 1. Restated in plain English, this property says 
that to square the golden ratio all you have to do is add one to it.
Our next example shows that the golden ratio is the only positive number satis-
fying the golden property.

can conclude that B
S = f (i.e., the divine proportion is satisfied only when the ratio 
of the bigger piece to the shorter piece equals the golden ratio f).
Throughout history, many famous painters, sculptors, architects, and designers 
are said to have looked at the golden ratio f = 1.618. . . as the perfect ratio of big 
to small and used it in their works. How much of it is true and how much of it is 
hype is a matter of some debate, but there is no shortage of man-made structures 
and everyday objects having approximately divine proportions (longer side/short-
er side  1.618  f). Figure 5 shows some random examples: A standard credit 
card measures 8.5 by 5.3 cm (aspect ratio of approximately 1.604); the screen of a  
MacBook Air measures 11.375 in by 7.1875 in (aspect ratio of approximately 1.583); 
the CN tower in Toronto (the tallest building in North America) has a height of 
553 m with an observation deck located at a height of 342 m (a ratio of approximate-
ly 1.617). While none of these ratios is exactly the golden ratio, in the real world the 
difference between a ratio of 1.604 and 1.618. . . is invisible to the human eye—so 
who cares? We can think of these ratios as imperfectly golden.
Fibonacci numbers and the Golden Ratio
Other than the fact that the Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio share equal 
billing in the title of this chapter, there is no particular reason to guess that they are 
connected in any way. But they are, and their relationship is very tight. In this sec-
tion we will briefly discuss just a few of the many ways that the Fibonacci numbers 
and the golden ratio come together.
 1. binet’s formula. Take another look at the original version of Binet’s formula. 
  The numerator has two numbers raised to the Nth power: 
1 + 15
2
 and 
1 - 15
2
. 
  We now know that the first of these numbers is f and the second is 1 - f (see 
Example 4). It follows that we can rewrite Binet’s original formula in terms 
  of f: FN = 3fN - 11 - f2N4 >25. Binet’s simplified formula takes an even nicer 
  form: FN = ŒfN>25œ.

Fibonacci  Numbers and the Golden Ratio
The most common usage of the word gnomon is to describe the pin of a sundial—the 
part that casts the shadow that shows the time of day. The original Greek meaning 
of the word gnomon is “one who knows,” so it’s not surprising that the word should 
find its way into the vocabulary of mathematics.
In this section we will discuss a different meaning for the word gnomon. Before 
we do so, we will do a brief review of a few facts from high school geometry.

We know from geometry that two objects are said to be similar if one is a scaled 
version of the other. The following important facts about similarity of basic two-
dimensional figures will come in handy later in the chapter:

 2. Golden power formula: FN  FN F  FN1. This formula is a generalization of 
the golden property. It expresses any power of f in terms of f and Fibonacci 
numbers. To see how this formula comes about, let’s compute f2 through f5.
 f2 = f + 1. [The golden property].
 f3 = 2f + 1. [Multiply both sides of f2 = f + 1 by f and replace f2 by f + 1. 
This gives f3 = f2 + f = 1f + 12 + f = 2f + 1.]
 f4 = 3f + 2. [Multiply both sides of f3 = 2f + 1 by f and replace f2 by f + 1. 
This gives f4 = 2f2 + f = 21f + 12 + f = 3f + 2.]
 f5 = 5f + 3. [Multiply both sides of f4 = 3f + 2 by f and replace f2 by f + 1. 
This gives f5 = 3f2 + 2f = 31f + 12 + 2f = 5f + 3.]
  If you look at the pattern that is emerging, you will notice that for each 
power of f the coefficients on the right-hand side are consecutive Fibonacci 
numbers: f2 = F2f + F1, f3 = F3f + F2, f4 = F4f + F3, and f5 = F5f + F4. 
The general version of this observation gives the golden power formula 
fN = FNf + FN-1.
 3. Ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers. Let’s look at the sequence of numbers 
obtained by dividing a Fibonacci number by the preceding Fibonacci number 
  1in other words, the sequence defined by the fractions

  sequence in fractional form doesn’t give us anything that looks very interesting:

  If we write the same numbers as decimals (rounded to six decimal places when 
needed), things look a lot more interesting: 
1, 2, 1.5, 1.666667, 1.6, 1.625, 1.615385, 1.619048, 1.617647, 1.618182, 
1.617978, 1.618056, 1.618026, 1.618037, 1.618033, 1.618034, . . .
  After a little while, the numbers in this sequence start to look like they are being 
attracted toward some number, and yes, that number is f. (In fact, rounded to 
six decimal places f = 1.618034, matching exactly the last number in our second 
list.) The fact that ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers get closer and closer
  to the golden ratio can be described symbolically by 1

Gnomons
We will now return to the main topic of this section—
gnomons. In geometry, a gnomon G to a figure A is a 
connected figure that, when suitably attached to A, pro-
duces a new figure similar to A. By “attached,” we mean 
that the two figures are coupled into one figure without 
any overlap. Informally, we will describe it this way: 
G is a gnomon to A if G & A is similar to A (Fig. 9). 
Here the symbol “&” should be taken to mean “attached 
in some suitable way.”

Gnomons to REctanGlEs
Consider a rectangle R of height h and base b as shown in Fig. 12(a). The L-shaped fig-
ure G shown in Fig. 12(b) can clearly be attached to R to form the larger rectangle R 
shown in Fig. 12(c). This does not, in and of itself, guarantee that G is a gnomon to R. The 
rectangle R [with height 1h + x2 and base 1b + y2] is similar to R if and only if their 
corresponding sides are proportional, which requires that b>h = 1b + y2> 1h + x2. 
With a little algebraic manipulation, this can be simplified to b>h = y>x.
There is a simple geometric way to determine if the L-shaped G is a gnomon to R—
just extend the diagonal of R in G & R. If the extended diagonal passes through the out-
side corner of G, then G is a gnomon [Fig. 12(c)]; if it doesn’t, then it isn’t [Fig. 12(d)].

In this example, we are going to do things a little bit backward. Let’s start with an 
isosceles triangle T, with vertices B, C, and D whose angles measure 72, 72, and 36, 
respectively, as shown in Fig. 13(a). On side CD we mark the point A so that BA is 
congruent to BC [Fig. 13(b)]. (A is the point of intersection of side CD and the circle 
of radius BC and center B.) Since T is an isosceles triangle, angle BAC measures 72
 and it follows that angle ABC measures 36. This implies that triangle T has equal 
angles as triangle T and, thus, they are similar triangles.

We now know how to find a gnomon not only to triangle T but also to any 72-
72-36 triangle, including the original triangle T: Attach a 36-36-108 triangle to one 
of the longer sides [Fig. 14(a)]. If we repeat this process indefinitely, we get a spiral-
ing series of ever-increasing 72-72-36 triangles [Fig. 14(b)]. It’s not too far-fetched 
to use a family analogy: Triangles T and G are the “parents,” with T having the 
“dominant genes”; the “offspring” of their union looks just like T (but bigger). The 
offspring then has offspring of its own (looking exactly like its grandparent T ), and 
so on ad infinitum.

Example 9 is of special interest to us for two reasons. First, this is the first time 
we have an example in which the figure and its gnomon are of the same type (isos-
celes triangles). Second, the isosceles triangles in this story (72-72-36 and 36-36-108) 
have a property that makes them unique: In both cases, the ratio of their sides (lon-
ger side over shorter side) is the golden ratio (see Exercise 66). These are the only 
two isosceles triangles with this property, and for this reason they are called golden 
triangles.
“So what?” you may ask. Where is the gnomon to triangle T? We don’t have 
one yet! But we do have a gnomon to triangle T—it is triangle BAD, labeled G in 
Fig. 13(c). After all, G & T give T—a triangle similar to T. Note that G is an isos-
celes triangle with angles that measure 36, 36, and 108.

We saw in Example 8 that any rectangle can have an L-shaped gnomon. Much more 
interesting is the case when a rectangle has a square gnomon. Not every rectangle 
can have a square gnomon, and the ones that do are quite special.
Consider a rectangle R with sides of length B and S [Fig. 15(a)], and suppose 
that the square G with sides of length B shown in Fig. 15(b) is a gnomon to R. If so, 
then the rectangle R shown in Fig. 15(c) must be similar to R, which implies that 
their corresponding sides must be proportional: B
S =
B + S
B . If this proportion looks 
familiar, it’s because it is the divine proportion we first discussed in Example 5 and 
whose only possible solution is B>S = f.

In nature, where form usually follows function, the perfect balance of a golden

Figure 16 shows an assortment of rectangles (please note that the rectangles are not 
drawn to the same scale). Some are golden, some are close.
n The rectangle in Fig. 16(a) has B = 1 and S = 1>f. Since B>S =  1> 11>f2 =f, 
this is a golden rectangle.
n The rectangle in Fig. 16(b) has B = f + 1 and S = f. Here B>S = 1f + 12>f. 
Since f + 1 = f 2, this is another golden rectangle.
n The rectangle in Fig. 16(c) has B = 8 and S = 5. This is a Fibonacci rectangle, since 5 
and 8 are consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The ratio of the sides is B>S = 8>5 = 1.6, 
so this is not a golden rectangle. On the other hand, the ratio 1.6 is reasonably close 
to f = 1.618. . . , so we will think of this rectangle as “imperfectly golden.”
n The rectangle in Fig. 16(d) with B = 89 and S = 55 is another Fibonacci rec-
tangle. Since 89>55 = 1.61818. . . , this rectangle is as good as golden—the ratio 
of the sides is the same as the golden ratio up to three decimal places.

Example 10 tells us that the only way that a rectangle can have a square gnomon 
is if its sides are in a divine proportion (i.e., B>S = f where B and S are the lengths 
of the bigger and shorter sides, respectively.
Golden and Fibonacci Rectangles
A rectangle whose sides are in the proportion of the golden ratio is called a golden 
rectangle. In other words, a golden rectangle is a rectangle with sides B and S sat-
isfying B>S = f. A close relative to a golden rectangle is a Fibonacci rectangle—a 
rectangle whose sides are consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

We might imagine these growing Fibonacci rectangles describing the growth 
of a living organism. In each generation, the organism grows by adding a square 
(a very simple, basic shape). The interesting feature of this growth is that as the 
Fibonacci rectangles grow larger, they become very close to golden rectangles, 
and as such, they become essentially similar to one another. This kind of growth— 
getting bigger while maintaining the same overall shape and proportion—is 
characteristic of the way many natural organisms grow.

Fibonacci  Numbers and the Golden Ratio
Gnomonic Growth
Natural organisms grow in essentially two different ways. Humans, most ani-
mals, and many plants grow following what can informally be described as an 
all-around growth rule. In this type of growth, all living parts of the organism 
grow simultaneously—but not necessarily at the same rate. One characteristic 
of this type of growth is that there is no obvious way to distinguish between the 
newer and the older parts of the organism. In fact, the distinction between new 
and old parts does not make much sense. The historical record (so to speak) of 
the organism’s growth is lost.
Contrast this with the kind of growth exemplified by the shell of a chambered 
nautilus, a ram’s horn, or the trunk of a redwood tree (Fig. 20). These organisms 
grow following a one-sided or asymmetric growth rule, meaning that the organism 
has a new part added to it in such a way that the old organism together with the 
added part form the new organism. At any stage of the growth process, we can 
see not only the present form of the organism but also the organism’s entire past. 
All the previous stages of growth are the building blocks that make up the present 
structure.
The other important aspect of natural growth is the principle of self-similarity: 
Organisms like to maintain their overall shape and proportions as they grow. This is 
where gnomons come into the picture. For the organism to retain its overall struc-
ture as it grows, the new growth must be a gnomon of the entire organism. We will 
call this kind of growth process gnomonic growth.
We have already seen abstract mathematical examples of gnomonic growth 
(Examples 12 and 13). Here is a pair of more realistic examples.
ExamplE 14 
ciRculaR Gnomonic GRowth
We know from Example 7 that the gnomon to a circular disk is an 
O-ring with an inner radius equal to the radius of the circle. We 
can, thus, have circular gnomonic growth (Fig. 21) by the regular 
addition of O-rings. O-rings added one layer at a time to a start-
ing circular structure preserve the circular shape throughout the 
structure’s growth. When carried to three dimensions, this is a 
good model for the way the trunk of a redwood tree grows. And 
this is why we can “read” the history of a felled redwood tree by 
studying its rings.

spiRal Gnomonic GRowth
Figure 22 shows a diagram of a cross section of the chambered nau-
tilus. The chambered nautilus builds its shell in stages, each time 
adding another chamber to the already existing shell. At every  
stage of its growth, the shape of the chambered nautilus shell 
remains the same—the beautiful and distinctive spiral shown in  
Fig. 20(a). This is a classic example of gnomonic growth—each new 
chamber added to the shell is a gnomon of the entire shell. The gno-
monic growth of the shell proceeds, in essence, as follows: Starting 
with its initial shell (a tiny spiral similar in all respects to the adult  
spiral shape), the animal builds a chamber (by producing a special 
secretion around its body that calcifies and hardens). The resulting, 
slightly enlarged spiral shell is similar to the original one. The process then repeats 
itself over many stages, each one a season in the growth of the animal. Each new 
chamber adds a gnomon to the shell, so the shell grows and yet remains similar to 
itself. This process is a real-life variation of the mathematical spiral-building process 
discussed in Example 13. The curve generated by the outer edge of a nautilus shell’s 
cross section is called a logarithmic spiral.
More complex examples of gnomonic growth occur in sunflowers, daisies, pineap-
ples, pinecones, and so on. Here, the rules that govern growth are somewhat more in-
volved, but Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio once again play a prominent role.

Some of the most beautiful shapes in nature arise from a basic principle of design: 
form follows function. The beauty of natural shapes is a result of their inherent 
elegance and efficiency, and imitating nature’s designs has helped humans design 
and build beautiful and efficient structures of their own.
In this chapter, we examined a special type of growth—gnomonic growth—
where an organism grows by the addition of gnomons, thereby preserving its basic 
shape even as it grows. Many beautiful spiral-shaped organisms, from seashells to 
flowers, exhibit this type of growth.
To us, understanding the basic principles behind spiral growth was relevant be-
cause it introduced us to some wonderful mathematical concepts that have been 
known and studied in their own right for centuries—Fibonacci numbers, the golden 
ratio, the divine proportion, and gnomons.
To humans, these abstract mathematical concepts have been, by and large, 
intellectual curiosities. To nature—the consummate artist and builder—they are 
the building tools for some of its most beautiful creations: flowers, plants, and 
seashells.

Exercises 21 through 24 refer to “Fibonacci-like” sequences.  
Fibonacci-like sequences are based on the same recursive rule as 
the Fibonacci sequence (from the third term on each term is the 
sum of the two preceding terms), but they are different in how 
they get started.

 1  Fibonacci numbers, the Golden Ratio, 
and phyllotaxis
In this chapter we mentioned that Fibonacci numbers and the 
golden ratio often show up in both the plant and animal worlds. 
In this project you are asked to expand on this topic.
 1. Give several detailed examples of the appearance of 
Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio in the plant world.  
Include examples of branch formation in plants, leaf  
arrangements around stems, and seed arrangements on 
circular seedheads (such as sunflower heads).
 2. Discuss the concept of phyllotaxis. What is it, and what are 
some of the mathematical theories behind it?
(Notes: The literature on Fibonacci numbers, the golden ratio, 
and phyllotaxis is extensive. A search on the Web should pro-
vide plenty of information.)
 2  the Golden Ratio in art, architecture, 
and music
It is often claimed that from the time of the ancient Greeks 
through the Renaissance to modern times, artists, architects, and 
musicians have been fascinated by the golden ratio. Choose one 
of the three fields (art, architecture, or music) and write a paper 
discussing the history of the golden ratio in that field. Describe 
famous works of art, architecture, or music in which the golden 
ratio is alleged to have been used. How? Who were the artists, 
architects, and composers?
Be forewarned that there are plenty of conjectures, un-
substantiated historical facts, controversies, claims, and counter-
claims surrounding some of the alleged uses of the golden  
ratio and Fibonacci numbers. Whenever appropriate, you should  
present both sides to a story.
 3 the Golden Ratio hypothesis
A long-held belief among those who study how humans perceive 
the outside world (mostly psychologists and psychobiologists) 
is that the golden ratio plays a special and prominent role in 
the human interpretation of “beauty.” Shapes and objects whose 
proportions are close to the golden ratio are believed to be more 
pleasing to human sensibilities than those that are not. This the-
ory, generally known as the golden ratio hypothesis, originated 
with the experiments of famous psychologist Gustav Fechner 
in the late 1800s. In a classic experiment, Fechner showed rec-
tangles of various proportions to hundreds of subjects and asked 
them to choose. His results showed that the rectangles that were 
close to the proportions of the golden ratio were overwhelm-
ingly preferred over the rest. Since Fechner’s original experi-
ment, there has been a lot of controversy about the golden ratio 
hypothesis, and many modern experiments have cast serious 
doubts about its validity.
Write a paper describing the history of the golden ratio 
hypothesis. Start with a description of Fechner’s original  
experiment. Follow up with other experiments duplicating  
Fechner’s results and some of the more recent experiments that 
seem to disprove the golden ratio hypothesis. Conclude with 
your own analysis.

65. From elementary geometry, AEF  DBA. So, AEF is simi-
lar to DBA. Thus, AF>FE = DA>AB, which shows that rectangle 
ADEF is similar to rectangle ABCD.
67. The result follows from Exercise 66(a) and a dissection of the regu-
lar pentagon into three golden triangles using any two nonintersect-
ing diagonals.
61. The sum of two odd numbers is always even, and the sum of an odd 
number and an even number is always odd. Since the seeds in the 
Fibonacci sequence are both odd, every third number is even and 
the others are all odd.
63. Attaching a gnomon to the L-shaped figure must result in a new, 
larger L-shaped figure—it must be higher, wider, and thicker (all by 
the same proportions). Of all the (five) possible ways of attaching a 
square to the L-shaped figure, none produces a similar figure.

The Joys of Collecting Data
How many mountain gorillas are left in the wild? How many people 
live in the United States? What percentage of voters plans to vote for 
the Republican Party candidate in the next election? Is hormone re-
placement therapy a risk factor for breast cancer in older women?  
Does an aspirin a day help prevent heart disease? Does coffee  
make you live longer?
Each one of these questions has an answer, and if you dig around 
you might even find it. And if you dig a little harder you might find more 
than one answer, and most likely, the answers will contradict each other. 
Which means that some of the answers out there might be wrong.

 ight or wrong, there are some questions in life that cannot be answered 
without data. Data are the clay with which we build the statistical bricks 
that inform much of our modern world. The purpose of collecting data is 
to make hypotheses, draw conclusions, and find explanations for what is happening 
around us. Our conclusions and explanations are only as good as the data we collect, 
and collecting good reliable data is a lot harder than it seems.
An interesting data collection story lurks behind every piece of statistical in-
formation. How was the data collected? By whom? Why? When? For how long? 
Who funded the effort? In this chapter we will explore a few basic ideas and  
issues in data collection. Most of the relevant issues and ideas are introduced 
through real-life examples and case studies. The chapter has lots of stories and no 
mathematical formulas (well, maybe two little ones).
One of the most basic purposes of data collection 
is enumeration: “How many X’s are there?” or “How 
many X’s have characteristic C?” Answers to these types 
of questions can be answered by a census, or estimated 
by using samples. We discuss this topic in Section 1. In 
Section 2 we discuss measurement questions. These are 
questions for which some characteristic or behavior must be measured, including  
opinions and intentions. Typically, these questions are answered through surveys 
and 
public 
opinion 
polls. The most difficult 
data collection ques-
tions are cause and ef-
fect questions: Does X 
cause Y? These are the 
types of questions that 
affect us most—diet, 
medications, exercise, 
behavior are all step-
children of cause and 
effect. We discuss data 
collection methods for 
cause and effect ques-
tions in Section 3.

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
The most basic enumeration questions are questions of the form How many X’s 
are there? To have a definitive, unequivocal answer to a question of this type, it 
is essential that the set of X’s being counted—called the population—be clearly 
defined.
n Population. This is the term we use to describe the set of “individuals” being 
enumerated (i.e., counted). The individuals may be people, animals, plants, or 
inanimate objects. A population is well-defined when given an individual we 
can clearly determine if the individual belongs to the population (and, there-
fore, should be counted) or not.
Typically, the members of the population are indivisible things, so the answer to 
an enumeration question of the type How many X’s are there? is a positive integer or 
zero (for enumeration purposes we don’t count parts of a person or an animal, and 
even inanimate objects are counted in terms of whole units). The standard conven-
tion is to use the letter N to denote the size of a population and to refer to a popula-
tion count as the N-value of the population.
n  N-value. A positive integer (or zero) that is alleged to be a count of the number 
of individuals in a given population.
There are essentially two ways to find the N-value of a given population: do 
a complete head count (this is just a commonly used metaphor—we can do “head 
counts” even for objects that don’t have heads), or do only a partial head count 
and use this partial information to estimate the N-value of the population. The first 
approach is called a census; the second approach is called (in very broad terms) a 
survey. We will illustrate both of these strategies next.

Hunting for Buffalo (nickEls)
A buffalo nickel is a historic, collectible coin whose value is definitely more than 
the five-cent face value of the coin—depending on its condition and the year it was 
minted, a buffalo nickel can be worth anywhere from a few dollars to several thou-
sand dollars. If you have some in your possession, it makes sense to set them aside 
and not comingle them with ordinary nickels.
Imagine that you have a very large coin jar where you have thrown your spare 
change over the years, and you know for a fact that there are some buffalo nickels 
in that jar (you remember throwing some in the jar when you were a kid). 
Imagine that you have some spare time and you need some extra cash, so 
you decide to hunt down the buffalo nickels, enumerate them, and eventu-
ally sell them to a coin dealer.
What is the population for this example? As is often the case, here the 
population is defined by the purpose of the enumeration: Since you are only 
interested in the buffalo nickels, they constitute the population of interest, 
and the number of buffalo nickels in the jar is the N-value you are after. (Had 
you been interested in how much money is in the jar, the population of inter-
est would be the entire set of coins in the jar, with a separate tally for nickels, 
dimes, quarters, etc.)
To find your N-value, your only reasonable option in this situation is 
to conduct a census of the buffalo nickels in your coin jar. This may be a

little time-consuming, but not hard—you are counting inanimate objects, and unlike 
humans and animals (more on that soon) inanimate objects are quite cooperative 
when it comes to a head count. To conduct your census you dump all the coins out of 
the jar and go through them one by one. Each time you find a buffalo nickel you set 
it aside and add one to your tally. When you have gone through all the coins in the 
jar you have completed the census. Ka-ching!
Censuses become considerably more complicated when you are enumerating 
animal populations. Unlike buffalo nickels or other inanimate species, most animal 
species live in large and tough habitats, move around, hide from humans, and some 
species, say tigers, like to snack on the people trying to enumerate them. Moreover, 
a full census for an entire animal species requires a lot of planning and tends to be 
quite expensive. Currently, efforts to accurately enumerate the members of a spe-
cies by means of a census are very rare and reserved for species that are critically 
endangered. One such species is the mountain gorilla.
ExamPlE 2 
How many mountain gorillas arE lEft in tHE wild?
Mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei) in the wild can only be found in cen-
tral Africa, in a relatively small natural habitat consisting of four contiguous national 
parks (one in Rwanda, two in Uganda and one in the Democratic Republic of Congo).
Due to loss of habitat and poaching, the mountain gorilla population had been 
in decline for decades and became (and still is) critically endangered—there were 
less than 300 mountain gorillas in the wild left in 1985. Since then, thanks to a world-
wide conservation effort (nudged by the success of the movie Gorillas in the Mist), 
poaching has been greatly reduced and the mountain gorilla population is slowly 
coming back. A census conducted in March and April of 2010 had a total count of 
786 mountain gorillas living in the wild. A new census is being organized for 2012–
2013.
To understand how much effort goes into an animal population census, consider 
the planning for the next mountain gorilla census.
n The census will be conducted by seven different teams of researchers who will 
sweep different regions of the gorilla’s natural habitat in a coordinated fashion.
n As the gorillas move around in small groups, a research team will follow behind 
a particular group for three days and enumerate the number of individuals in 
the group.
n To enumerate the number of individuals in a group, the research team will use 
their nests as a proxy. This means that, rather than counting the gorillas directly 
(that would require following the group too closely), the team will count the 
number of nests left behind (each gorilla builds his or her own new nest to sleep 
in each night).
n To make sure that the counts are completely accurate, samples of fecal matter 
(i.e., gorilla poop) will be collected from each nest for later analysis. The poop 
sample serves as a second proxy—it provides the DNA markers that uniquely 
identify each individual. To insure accuracy, samples will be collected from 
nests on three consecutive nights.
n It will take about nine months after the field work is finished to analyze the 
data and release a new N-value for the mountain gorilla population. (The data 
should be available sometime in 2013.)
One would think that accurately enumerating human populations should be a 
lot easier than enumerating animals in the wild, but this is not always the case. What 
is the population of the United States? We have a rough idea but not an exact count, 
in spite of the fact that we spend billions of dollars trying.

How many PEoPlE livE in tHE unitEd statEs?
This is an example of an enumeration question whose an-
swer changes by the minute, and yet there is a current, up-
to-date answer that you can easily find: Go to www.census
.gov/population/www/popclockus.html. This Web site is the 
virtual version of the United States population clock main-
tained by the U.S. Census Bureau. (Check it out now and 
see what the current number is!) To be clear about what 
that number represents: It is the official N-value for the 
resident population of the United States, and it enumerates 
everyone—citizens, permanent residents, illegal aliens, visi-
tors, and tourists—physically present in the United States at 
that moment in time.
How is the Census Bureau able to keep track of the 
N-value of a population that essentially changes by the min-
ute? There are two parts to the answer: (1) establishing a baseline, and (2) using that 
baseline as the initial population together with a mathematical model that projects 
how that population changes over time. In this example we will focus on describing 
how the baseline is set. This is where the Census comes in.
Every 10 years, the United States conducts a census of its population, officially 
called the United States Population Census but most commonly referred to (at least 
in the United States) as the Census. While most countries conduct periodic censuses 
of their populations, the United States is the only country where 
the population census is required by the country’s constitution.
Accurately enumerating a population as large and diverse as 
that of the United States is practically impossible, but we try it 
anyway (it is required by law). The amount of effort and money 
spent on this enumeration is staggering. The 2010 U.S. Census in-
volved hiring 635,000 enumerators and cost around $13 billion—
roughly $42 per head counted. (We will describe in more detail 
the inner workings of the U.S. Census in Case Study 1 at the end 
of this section.)
The final official tally for the 2010 Census: On April 1, 2010 
(Census Day), the resident population of the United States was 
N = 308,745,538. While nobody expected this number to be right on, post-enu-
meration surveys (using a more sophisticated methodology than just counting 
heads) showed that the official count was off by roughly 36,000 heads too many. 
This may seem like a lot of heads to overcount after spending that much money, 
but it represents a relative error of just 0.012%. By traditional U.S. Census stan-
dards the 2010 Census was a big success.
surveys for Enumeration
In this chapter we use the word survey in its broadest meaning: Any strategy that 
uses a sample from a population to draw conclusions about the entire population is 
a survey (even when there are no questionnaires to fill or phone calls to answer). 
When the nurse draws a sample of blood from your arm and the sample is used to 
measure your white cell count, in the broadest sense of the word she is in fact con-
ducting a survey. The working assumption is that the blood drawn from your arm is 
a good representative of the rest of your blood.
One way to think of a survey is as the flip side of a census. (A census involves 
every individual in the population; a survey only involves some individuals.) Before 
we look at some examples of how surveys are used to estimate population counts, 
we introduce a few useful terms.
. . . this was an outstanding census. 
When this fact is added to prior 
positive evaluations, the American 
public can be proud of the 2010 
Census their participation made 
possible.

Surveys are used to measure characteristics of a population or to predict the

but surveys can also be used to estimate the N-value of a population. We will discuss 
this particular use of surveys in the next couple of examples.

dEfEctivE ligHtBulBs: onE-samPlE Estimation
Have you ever bought an electronic product, taken it home, and found out 
it is defective? When the product is a big-ticket item like a computer or a 
plasma TV, buying a lemon is especially frustrating; but, even for minor 
items like a lightbulb, it can be aggravating (you climb on a step ladder,  
remove the old lightbulb, screw in the new lightbulb, flip the switch, no 
light, @%#!).
To minimize the problem of factory defectives, manufacturers do qual-
ity control tests on their products before shipping. For big-ticket items, 
every single item is factory tested for quality control, but for cheaper  
items like lightbulbs this is not cost-effective, so the quality control testing 
is done using a sample.
Imagine you are quality control manager for a lightbulb manufac-
turer. The lightbulbs come out of the assembly line in batches of 100,000. 
The manufacturer’s specs are that if the batch has more than 2500 defective bulbs 
(2.5%) the batch cannot be shipped. In this situation the population of interest con-
sists of the defective lightbulbs in the batch, but testing the entire batch of 100,000 
to enumerate the defectives is too time-consuming and expensive. Instead, you have 
a sample of 800 selected and tested. Out of the 800 lightbulbs tested, 17 turn out to 
be defective.
We can now estimate the total number of defective lightbulbs in the batch by as-
suming that the proportion of defectives in the entire batch is approximately the same
as the proportion of defectives in the sample. In other words, 17
800 
N
100,000. Solving for
N gives an estimate (i.e., a statistic) of N  2125 defectives in the batch, well un-
der the allowed quota of 2500. We will never know the exact number of defective 
lightbulbs in the batch (the parameter) unless we test the entire batch, but we feel 
confident that this shipment is good to go. 
The underlying assumption of the sampling method used in Example 4 [some-
times called one-sample (or single-sample) estimation] is that the percentage of de-
fectives in the sample is roughly the same as the percentage of defectives in the 
entire batch. To insure that this assumption is valid, the sample has to be carefully 
chosen and be sufficiently large. We will discuss what “carefully chosen” and “suf-
ficiently large” mean in greater detail in Section 2.
The general description of one-sample estimation is as follows: Suppose we have 
a general population of known size P (in our last example, P = 100,000 lightbulbs) 
and we want to find the N-value of a subpopulation having some specified charac-
teristic (for example, being a defective lightbulb). We can estimate this N-value by

carefully choosing a sample of size n (in our last example n = 800) and counting the 
number of individuals in that sample having that particular characteristic. Call that 
number k (in our last example, k = 17). Then, if we assume that the percentage of 
individuals with the desired characteristic is roughly the same in both the sample 
and the general population, we get k

We can only estimate the N-value of a subpopulation using a sample if we know 
P, the size of the general population. In many real-life applications we don’t. There 
is, however, an extremely useful sampling method that allows us to estimate the 
N-value of any population called two-sample estimation, and more commonly as 
the capture-recapture method. The most common application of this method is in 
the study of fish and wildlife populations (thus the name capture-recapture), and 
it involves taking two consecutive samples of the population (thus the name two-
sample estimation). We will illustrate the method with an example first and then give 
a general description.
ExamPlE 5 
counting fisH PoPulations: caPturE-rEcaPturE
Imagine you are a wildlife biologist studying the ecosystem in a small 
lake. A major player in this lake is the northern pike—a voracious car-
nivore that eats the hatchlings of other fish such as trout and salmon. 
To maintain a healthy ecosystem, the population of pike has to be 
controlled, and this requires taking regular measurements of the N-
value of the pike population in the lake. Here’s how you do this.
n  step 1 (the capture). You capture the first sample of pike, tag them 
(gently—you want to avoid harming them in any way), and release 
them back into the lake. Let’s say in this case the first sample con-
sists of n1 = 200 pike. Once you release the tagged pike back into 
the lake, you can assume that the percentage of tagged pike in the 
 
lake is given by the ratio 
200
N  (remember, N is your unknown).
n  step 2 (the recapture). After waiting awhile (you want the released fish to dis-
 
perse naturally throughout the lake) you capture a second sample of pike and 
count the number of pike in the second sample that have tags. Let’s say that the 
second sample consisted of n2 = 150 pike, of which k = 21 had tags. This means 
that the percentage of tagged pike in the sample is given by the ratio 21
150 (we 
won’t worry about the computations yet).
The working assumption now is that the percentage of tagged pike in the sample 
is roughly the same as the percentage of tagged pike in the lake. In other words, 
21

200
N . Solving for N gives N 
200 * 150
21
= 1428.57. Since the number of pike in the 
lake has to be a whole number we round the estimate to N = 1429.
The underlying assumption of the capture-recapture method is that both sam-
ples (the capture sample and the recapture sample) are good representatives of the 
entire population, and for this to happen, several requirements have to be met:
 (1) The chances of being captured are the same for all members of the population.
 (2) The chances of being recaptured are the same for both tagged and untagged 
individuals.
 (3) The general population remains unchanged between the capture and the recap-
ture (i.e., no births, deaths, or escapes).
 (4) The tags do not come off.
When these requirements are met (or mostly met), the capture-recapture method 
gives very good estimates of a population size.

The capture-recapture method has many other applications beyond wildlife 
ecology. It is used in epidemiology to estimate the number of individuals infected 
with a particular disease, and it is used in public health to estimate birth rates and 
death rates in a particular population.
The general description of the two-sample estimation (or capture–recapture) 
method (borrowing the terminology of wildlife ecology) is as follows:
n step 1 (the capture). Choose a sample of the population consisting of n1 individ-
uals. “Tag” the individuals in the sample. Release the tagged individuals back 
into the general population. 
 
 
[“Tag” is a metaphor for giving the individuals an identifying mark—it 
could be anything from an ink dot on a dorsal fin to an asterisk on a spreadsheet. 
The two most important things about the tag are that (1) it should not harm the 
individual and (2) it should not come off in the time between the capture and 
the recapture.] 
n  step 2 (the recapture). Choose a second sample of the population consisting of 
n2 individuals and count the number of tagged individuals in the second sample. 
Let k denote the number of tagged individuals in the second sample.
n  step 3. Set up the proportion 
k

N, and solve for N. When the value of N is not 
a whole number, round it to the nearest whole number.
We conclude this section with Case Study 1, a general discussion of the United 
States Census, the role it plays in our lives, and the statistical issues that are in-
volved.
casE study 1  ThE UnITED STATES CEnSUS
Article 1, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution mandates that a national census be 
conducted every 10 years. The original purpose of the national census was to “count 
heads” for a twofold purpose: taxes and political representation 
(i.e., the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives 
to the states based on their populations). Like many other parts of 
the Constitution, Article 1, Section 2, was a compromise of many 
conflicting interests: The census count was to exclude “Indians not 
taxed” and to count slaves as “three-fifths of a free Person.”
Today, the scope of the U.S. Census has been greatly expanded 
by the Fourteenth Amendment and by the courts to count the full 
“resident population” of the United States on Census Day (April 
1 of every year that ends with 0). The modern census does a lot 
more than give the national population count: It provides a com-
plete breakdown of the population by state, county, city, etc.; it 
collects demographic information about the population (gender, 
age, ethnicity, marital status, etc.); and it collects economic information (income, 
employment, housing, etc.).
The data collected by the U.S. Census is considered a vital part of the nation’s

n collect vital government data such as the Consumer Price Index and the Current 
Population Survey, and

All the data collected by the Census is obtained through some form of sampling 
(they are all statistics, rather than parameters) except for one—the national and 
individual state populations are required by law to be collected by means of a full 
census. (So ruled the Supreme Court in 1999 in Department of Commerce et al. v. 
United States House of Representatives et al.)
Table 1 shows the population count from the last three national censuses, the 
approximate cost of each, the cost per head counted, and the estimated error (un-
dercount/overcount) in each case (+ indicates an overcount, – an undercount). All 
it takes is a look at Table 1 to see that the U.S. Census is an incredibly expensive 
data collection effort that (except for the 2010 Census) does not produce very good 
data and misses a lot of people. (Ironically, to obtain a more accurate count and 
estimate the error in the official count, the Census Bureau uses a post-enumeration 
survey based on the capture-recapture method—cheaper, more efficient, and more 
accurate). So, why do we continue spending billions on a flawed data collection  
system? Good question.
Finding the N-value of a population is, in a sense, the simplest data collection prob-
lem there is (not to say that it is easy, as we have learned by now). In most situations 
we don’t need to perform any measurements or ask any questions—we just count 
(either the sample or the entire population). Things become quite a bit trickier when 
the information we want requires more than just counting heads: What is the medi-
an home price in California? What is your cholesterol level? What is the level of cus-
tomer satisfaction with our company’s customer service? What percentage of voters 
will vote Republican in the next election?, etc. The data needed to answer these 
types of questions require either some sort of measurement (tracking home sales in 
a real estate database, counting cholesterol molecules) or some form of question/  
answer interaction (How would you rate our customer service? If the election were 
held today, would you vote for the Republican Party’s candidate? etc.). We will use 
the term measurement problem to describe both situations (the point being that 
asking questions to assess people’s opinions or intentions is also a form 
of measurement).
The typical way to answer a measurement problem is to conduct a 
survey (called a poll when the measurements require asking questions 
and recording answers). The three basic steps in any survey or poll are: 
(1) sampling (i.e., choosing the sample—or samples if more than one sam-
ple is required), (2) “measuring” the individuals in the sample, and (3)  
drawing inferences about the population from the measurements in the 
sample. Each of these three steps sounds simple enough, but there is a lot 
of devil in the details. For the rest of this chapter we will focus on step 1.

sampling
The basic philosophy behind sampling is simple and well understood—if you choose 
a “good” sample you can get reasonably reliable data about the population by mea-
suring just the individuals in the sample (you can never draw perfectly accurate data 
from a sample). Conversely, if your sample is not good (statisticians call it biased), 
then any conclusions you draw from the sample are unreliable.
A good sample is one that is “representative” of the population and is large 
enough to cover the variability in the population. The preceding sentence is a bit 
vague to say the least, and we will try to clarify its meaning in the remainder of this 
section, but let’s start with the issue of sample size.
When the population is highly homogeneous, then a small sample is good 
enough to represent the entire population. Take, for example, 
blood samples for lab testing: All it takes is a small blood sample 
drawn from an arm to get reliable data about all kinds of mea-
sures—white and red cell counts, cholesterol levels, sugar levels, 
etc. A small blood sample is a good enough sample because a per-
son’s blood is essentially the same throughout the body. At the 
other end of the spectrum, when a population is very heteroge-
neous, a large sample is necessary (but not sufficient) if the sample 
is going to represent all the variability in the population. What’s 
important to keep in mind is that it’s not the size of the population 
that dictates the size of a good sample but rather the variability in 
the population. That’s why a sample of 1500 people can be good 
enough to represent the population of a small city, a large city, or 
the whole country.
It is a customary to use n to denote the size of a sample (to 
distinguish it from N, the size of the population). The ratio n>N 
is called the sampling proportion, and is typically expressed as a 
percentage.
Whether you poll the United States 
or new York State or Baton Rouge . . .  
you need . . . the same number of 
interviews or sample [size]. It’s no 
mystery really—if a cook has two 
pots of soup on the stove, one far 
larger than the other, and thoroughly 
stirs them both, he doesn’t have  
to take more spoonfuls from one 
than the other to sample the taste 
accurately.

dEfEctivE ligHtBulBs: samPling ProPortion
In Example 4 we used a sample of n = 800 lightbulbs taken from a batch of 
N = 100,000 to determine the number of defective lightbulbs in the batch. In this 
example we are lucky—we know both n and N and we can compute the sampling 
proportion easily: n>N = 0.008 = 0.8%.
While a sampling proportion of 0.8% may seem very small (and in many appli-
cations it would be), it is more than adequate in this situation. Lightbulbs are fairly 
homogeneous objects (no moving parts and just a very few elements that could go 
bad), so a sample of n = 800 is large enough for this population. A more relevant 
question is, How was the sample chosen?
Choosing a “good” sample is the most important and complex part of the 
data collection process. But how do we know if a sample is a “good” sample or 
not? The key lies in the idea of “equal opportunity”—we want every member of 
the population to have an equal chance of being included in the sample. When 
some members of the population are less likely to be selected for the sample 
than others (even if it is unintentional) we have a biased sample (or sampling 
bias), and a biased sample is an unreliable sample. To restate the point, in a 
survey, reliable measurements of a population are only possible when using an 
unbiased sample.
Depending on the nature of the population, choosing an unbiased sample can 
be difficult, sometimes impossible. There are many reasons why a sample can be 
biased, and we will illustrate some of them next.

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
selection Bias
When the selection of the sample has a built-in tendency (whether intentional or 
not) to exclude a particular group or characteristic within the population, we say 
that the survey suffers from selection bias.
One significant example of selection bias occurs when the sampling frame for 
a survey is different from the target population. As the name indicates, the target 
population is the population to which the conclusions of the survey apply—in other 
words the population the survey is talking about. The sampling frame is the popula-
tion from which the sample is drawn. Ideally, the two should be the same but some-
times they are not, and in that case there will be individuals in the population that 
have zero chance of being selected for the sample (Fig. 1).
The distinction between the target population and the sampling frame pre-
sents a very significant problem for polls that try to predict the results of an elec-
tion. The target population for such a poll consists of the people that are going 
to vote in the election, but how do you identify that group? The conventional 
approach is to use registered voters as the sampling frame, but using registered 
voters does not always work out very well, as shown in the next example.

PrE-ElEction Polls: rEgistErEd v. likEly votErs
A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll conducted right before the November 2, 2004, na-
tional election asked the following question: “If the election for Congress were be-
ing held today, which party’s candidate would you vote for in your congressional 
district, the Democratic Party’s candidate or the Republican Party’s candidate?”
When the question was asked of 1866 registered voters nationwide, the results 
of the poll were 49% for the Democratic Party candidate, 47% for the Republican 
Party candidate, 4% undecided.
When exactly the same question was asked of 1573 likely voters nationwide, the 
results of the poll were 50% for the Republican Party candidate, 47% for the Demo-
cratic Party candidate, 3% undecided.
Clearly, one of the two polls had to be wrong, because in the first poll the Demo-
crats beat out the Republicans, whereas in the second poll it was the other way 
around. The only significant difference between the two polls was the choice of the 
sampling frame—in the first poll the sampling frame consisted of all registered  voters, 
and in the second poll the sampling frame consisted of all likely voters.  Although 
neither one faithfully represents the target population of actual voters, using likely 
voters instead of registered voters for the sampling frame gives much more reliable 
data. (The second poll predicted very closely the average results of the 2004 congres-
sional races across the nation.)
So, why don’t all pre-election polls use likely voters as a sampling frame instead 
of registered voters? The answer is economics. Registered voters are relatively easy 
to identify—every county registrar can produce an accurate list of registered voters. 
Not every registered voter votes, though, and it is much harder to identify those who 
are “likely” to vote. (What is the definition of likely anyway?) Typically, one has to 
look at demographic factors (age, ethnicity, etc.) as well as past voting behavior to 
figure out who is likely to vote and who isn’t. Doing that takes a lot more effort, time, 
and money.
convenience sampling
There is always a cost (effort, time, money) associated with collecting data, and it is 
a truism that this cost is proportional to the quality of the data collected—the better 
the data, the more effort required to collect it. It follows that the temptation to take 
shortcuts when collecting data is always there and that data collected “on the cheap” 
should always be scrutinized carefully. One commonly used shortcut in sampling is 
470

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
known as convenience sampling. In convenience sampling the selection of which 
individuals are in the sample is dictated by what is easiest or cheapest for the people 
collecting the data.
A classic example of convenience sampling is when interviewers set up at a fixed 
location such as a mall or outside a supermarket and ask passersby to be part of a 
public opinion poll. A different type of convenience sampling occurs when the sam-
ple is based on self-selection—the sample consists of those individuals who volun-
teer to be in it. Self-selection bias is the reason why many Area Code 800 polls (“Call 
1-800-YOU-NUTS to express your opinion on the new tax proposal . . .”) are not 
to be trusted. Even worse are the Area Code 900 polls, for which an individual has 
to actually pay (sometimes as much as $2) to be in the sample. A sample consisting 
entirely of individuals who paid to be in the sample is not likely to be a representa-
tive sample of general public opinion.
Convenience sampling is not always bad—at times there is no other choice 
or the alternatives are so expensive that they have to be ruled out. We should 
keep in mind, however, that data collected through convenience sampling are 
naturally tainted and should always be scrutinized (that’s why we always want to 
get to the details of how the data were collected).
Our next case study is a famous case in the history of pre-election polls, 
and it illustrates the many things that can go wrong when a biased sample is se-
lected—even when it is a very large sample.
casE study 2  ThE 1936 Literary DigeSt PoLL
The U.S. presidential election of 1936 pitted Alfred Landon, the Republican gover-
nor of Kansas, against the incumbent Democratic President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
At the time of the election, the nation had not yet emerged from the Great Depres-
sion, and economic issues such as unemployment and government spending were 
the dominant themes of the campaign.
The Literary Digest, one of the most respected magazines of the time, conducted 
a poll a couple of weeks before the election. The magazine had used polls to accu-
rately predict the results of every presidential election since 1916, and their 1936 poll 
was the largest and most ambitious poll ever. The sampling frame for the Literary 
Digest poll consisted of an enormous list of names that included (1) every person 
listed in a telephone directory anywhere in the United States, (2) every person on 
a magazine subscription list, and (3) every person listed on the roster of a club or 
professional association. From this sampling frame a list of about 10 million names 
was created, and every name on this list was mailed a mock ballot and asked to mark 
it and return it to the magazine.
One cannot help but be impressed by the sheer scope and ambition of the 1936 
Literary Digest poll, as well as the magazine’s unbounded confidence in its accuracy. 
In its issue of August 22, 1936, the Literary Digest crowed:
Once again, [we are] asking more than ten million voters—one out of four, rep-
resenting every county in the United States—to settle November’s election in  
October.
Next week, the first answers from these ten million will begin the incoming 
tide of marked ballots, to be triple-checked, verified, five-times cross-classified 
and totaled. When the last figure has been totted and checked, if past experience 
is a criterion, the country will know to within a fraction of 1 percent the actual 
popular vote of forty million [voters].
Based on the poll results, the Literary Digest predicted a landslide victory for 
Landon with 57% of the vote, against Roosevelt’s 43%. Amazingly, the election 
turned out to be a landslide victory for Roosevelt with 62% of the vote, against 38% 
for Landon. The difference between the poll’s prediction and the actual election 
results was a whopping 19%, the largest error ever in a major public opinion poll. 
471

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
The results damaged the credibility of the magazine so much so that soon after the 
election its sales dried up and it went out of business—the victim of a major statisti-
cal blunder.
For the same election, a young pollster named George Gallup was able to pre-
dict accurately a victory for Roosevelt using a sample of “only” 50,000 people. In 
fact, Gallup also publicly predicted, to within 1%, the incorrect results that the 
Literary Digest would get using a sample of just 3000 people taken from the same 
sampling frame the magazine was using. What went wrong with the Literary Digest 
poll and why was Gallup able to do so much better?
The first thing seriously wrong with the Literary Digest poll was the sampling 
frame, consisting of names taken from telephone directories, lists of magazine 
subscribers, rosters of club members, and so on. Telephones in 1936 were some-
thing of a luxury, and magazine subscriptions and club memberships even more 
so, at a time when 9 million people were unemployed. When it came to economic 
status the Literary Digest sample was far from being a representative cross sec-
tion of the voters. This was a critical problem, because voters often vote on eco-
nomic issues, and given the economic conditions of the time, this was especially 
true in 1936.
The second serious problem with the Literary Digest poll was the issue of 
nonresponse bias. In a typical poll it is understood that not every individual is 
willing to respond to the request to participate (and in a democracy we cannot 
force them to do so). Those individuals who do not respond to the poll are called 
nonrespondents, and those who do are called respondents. The percentage of re-
spondents out of the total sample is called the response rate. For the Literary 
Digest poll, out of a sample of 10 million people who were mailed a mock ballot 
only about 2.4 million mailed a ballot back, resulting in a 24% response rate. 
When the response rate to a poll is low, the poll is said to suffer from nonresponse 
bias. (Exactly at what point the response rate is to be considered low depends on 
the circumstances and nature of the poll, but a response rate of 24% is generally 
considered very low.)
Nonresponse bias can be viewed as a special type of selection bias—it excludes 
from the sample reluctant and uninterested people. Since reluctant and uninterested 
people can represent a significant slice of the population, we don’t want them ex-
cluded from the sample. But getting reluctant, uninterested, and apathetic slugs to 
participate in a survey is a conundrum—in a free country we cannot force people to 
participate, and bribing them with money or chocolate chip cookies is not always a 
practical solution.
One of the significant problems with the Literary Digest poll was that the poll 
was conducted by mail. This approach is the most likely to magnify nonresponse 
bias, because people often consider a mailed questionnaire just another form of 
junk mail. Of course, given the size of their sample, the Literary Digest hardly had 
a choice. This illustrates another important point: Bigger is not better, and a big 
sample can be more of a liability than an asset.
Quota sampling
Quota sampling is a systematic effort to force the sample to be representative of a 
given population through the use of quotas—the sample should have so many women,  
so many men, so many blacks, so many whites, so many people living in urban areas, 
so many people living in rural areas, and so on. The proportions in each category 
in the sample should be the same as those in the population. If we can assume that 
every important characteristic of the population is taken into account when the quo-
tas are set up, it is reasonable to expect that the sample will be representative of the 
population and produce reliable data.
Our next historical example illustrates some of the difficulties with the assump-
tions behind quota sampling.

tHE 1948 PrEsidEntial ElEction: Quota samPling
George Gallup had introduced quota sampling as early as 1935 and 
had used it successfully to predict the winner of the 1936, 1940, and 
1944 presidential elections. Quota sampling thus acquired the 
reputation of being a “scientifically reliable” sampling method, 
and by the 1948 presidential election all three major national 
polls—the Gallup poll, the Roper poll, and the Crossley poll—
used quota sampling to make their pre-election predictions.
For the 1948 election between Thomas Dewey and Harry  
Truman, Gallup conducted a poll with a sample of approximately 
3250 people. Each individual in the sample was interviewed in person 
by a professional interviewer to minimize nonresponse bias, and each 
interviewer was given a very detailed set of quotas to meet—for example, 7 
white males under 40 living in a rural area, 5 black males over 40 living in a 
rural area, 6 white females under 40 living in an urban area, and so on. By the 
time all the interviewers met their quotas, the entire sample was 
expected to accurately represent the entire population in every 
respect: gender, race, age, and so on.
Based on his sample, Gallup predicted that Dewey, the Re-
publican candidate, would win the election with 49.5% of the 
vote to Truman’s 44.5% (with third-party candidates Strom Thurmond and Henry 
Wallace accounting for the remaining 6%). The Roper and Crossley polls also pre-
dicted an easy victory for Dewey. (In fact, after an early September poll showed 
Truman trailing Dewey by 13 percentage points, Roper announced that he would 
discontinue polling since the outcome was already so obvious.) The actual results of 
the election turned out to be almost the exact reverse of Gallup’s prediction: Truman 
got 49.9% and Dewey 44.5% of the national vote.
Truman’s victory was a great surprise to the nation as a whole. So convinced was 
the Chicago Daily Tribune of Dewey’s victory that it went to press on its early edi-
tion for November 4, 1948, with the headline “Dewey defeats Truman.” The picture 
of Truman holding aloft a copy of the Tribune and his famous retort “Ain’t the way I 
heard it” have become part of our national folklore.
To pollsters and statisticians, the erroneous predictions of the 1948 election 
had two lessons: (1) Poll until election day, and (2) quota sampling is intrinsically 
flawed.
What’s wrong with quota sampling? After all, the basic idea behind it appears to 
be a good one: Force the sample to be a representative cross section of the popula-
tion by having each important characteristic of the population proportionally repre-
sented in the sample. Since income is an important factor in determining how people 
vote, the sample should have all income groups represented in the same proportion 
as the population at large. The same should be true for gender, race, age, and so 
on. Right away, we can see a potential problem: Where do we stop? No matter how 
careful we might be, we might miss some criterion that would affect the way people 
vote, and the sample could be deficient in this regard.
An even more serious flaw in quota sampling is that, other than meeting the 
quotas, the interviewers are free to choose whom they interview. This opens the 
door to selection bias. Looking back over the history of quota sampling, we can see a 
clear tendency to overestimate the Republican vote. In 1936, using quota sampling, 
Gallup predicted that the Republican candidate would get 44% of the vote, but the 
actual number was 38%. In 1940, the prediction was 48%, and the actual vote was 
45%; in 1944, the prediction was 48%, and the actual vote was 46%. Gallup was able 
to predict the winner correctly in each of these elections, mostly because the spread 
between the candidates was large enough to cover the error. In 1948, Gallup (and all 
the other pollsters) simply ran out of luck. 
“Ain’t the way I heard it,” Truman gloats while holding 
an early edition of the Chicago Daily Tribune in which 
the headline erroneously claimed a Dewey victory 
based on the predictions of all the polls.

The failure of quota sampling as a method for getting representative samples 
has a simple moral: Even with the most carefully laid plans, human intervention in 
choosing the sample can result in selection bias.
random sampling
The best alternative to human selection is to let the laws of chance determine the 
selection of a sample. Sampling methods that use randomness as part of their design 
are known as random sampling methods, and any sample obtained through random 
sampling is called a random sample (or a probability sample).
The idea behind random sampling is that the decision as to which individu-
als should or should not be in the sample is best left to chance because the laws 
of chance are better than human design in coming up with a representative 
sample. At first, this idea seems somewhat counterintuitive. How can a process 
based on random selection guarantee an unbiased sample? Isn’t it possible to 
get by sheer bad luck a sample that is very biased (say, for example, a sample 
consisting of males only)? In theory, such an outcome is possible, but in prac-
tice, when the sample is large enough, the odds of it happening are so low that 
we can pretty much rule it out.
Most present-day methods of quality control in industry, corporate audits in 
business, and public opinion polling are based on random sampling. The reliability 
of data collected by random sampling methods is supported by both practical expe-
rience and mathematical theory.
The most basic form of random sampling is called simple random sampling. It 
is based on the same principle as a lottery: Any set of numbers of a given size has 
an equal chance of being chosen as any other set of numbers of the same size. Thus, 
if a lottery ticket consists of six winning numbers, a fair lottery is one in which any 
combination of six numbers has the same chance of winning as any other combi-
nation of six numbers. In sampling, this means that any group of members of the 
population should have the same chance of being the sample as any other group 
of the same size.

dEfEctivE ligHtBulBs: simPlE random samPling
We introduced the idea of sampling as a tool for quality control in 
Example 4, and in Example 6 we followed up with a discussion of 
the sample size. The last part of the story is the method for choosing 
the sample, and for most quality-control testing situations, simple 
random sampling is the method of choice.
Suppose we want to choose a sample of n = 800 lightbulbs out 
of a batch of N = 100,000 lightbulbs coming out of an assembly line. 
The first step is to use a computer program to randomly draw 800 
different numbers between 1 and 100,000. This can be done in a 
matter of seconds. Say that the 800 numbers chosen by the com-
puter are 74, 159, 311, etc. Then, as the lightbulbs move out of the 
production line the 74th, 159th, 311th, etc. bulbs are selected and 
tested. With robotic arms, the whole process can be implemented seamlessly and 
without any human intervention.
In theory, simple random sampling is easy to implement. We put the name of 
each individual in the population in “a hat,” mix the names well, and then draw as 
many names as we need for our sample. Of course “a hat” is just a metaphor. If our 
population is 100 million voters and we want to choose a simple random sample of 
1500, we will not be putting all 100 million names in a real hat and then drawing 1500 
names one by one. These days, the “hat” is a computer database containing a list of

members of the population. A computer program then randomly selects the names. 
This is a fine idea for easily accessible populations such as lightbulbs coming off of 
an assembly line, but a hopeless one when it comes to national surveys and public 
opinion polls.
Implementing simple random sampling in national public opinion polls raises 
problems of expediency and cost. Interviewing hundreds of individuals chosen by 
simple random sampling means chasing people all over the country, a task that re-
quires an inordinate amount of time and money. For most public opinion polls— 
especially those done on a regular basis—the time and money needed to do this are 
simply not available.
The alternative to simple random sampling used nowadays for national sur-
veys and public opinion polls is a sampling method known as stratified sampling. 
The basic idea of stratified sampling is to break the sampling frame into catego-
ries, called strata, and then (unlike quota sampling) randomly choose a sample 
from these strata. The chosen strata are then further divided into categories, 
called substrata, and a random sample is taken from these substrata. The se-
lected substrata are further subdivided, a random sample is taken from them, 
and so on. The process goes on for a predetermined number of steps (usually 
four or five).
Our next example illustrates how stratified sampling is used to conduct  
national public opinion polls. Basic variations of the same idea can be used at the 
state, city, or local level. The specific details, of course, will be different.
ExamPlE 10 
PuBlic oPinion Polls: stratifiEd samPling
In national public opinion polls the strata 
and substrata are defined by a combination 
of geographic and demographic criteria. For  
example, the nation is first divided into “size of 
community” strata (big cities, medium cities, 
small cities, villages, rural areas, etc.). The 
strata are then subdivided by geographical 
region (New England, Middle Atlantic, East 
Central, etc.). This is the first layer of sub-
strata. Within each geographical region and 
within each size of community stratum some 
communities (called sampling locations) are 
selected by simple random sampling. The se-
lected sampling locations are the only places where interviews will be conducted. 
Next, each of the selected sampling locations is further subdivided into geographi-
cal units called wards. This is the second layer of substrata. Within each sampling 
location some of the wards are selected using simple random sampling. The selected 
wards are then divided into smaller units, called precincts (third layer), and within 
each ward some of its precincts are selected by simple random sampling. At the last 
stage, households (fourth layer) are selected from within each precinct by simple 
random sampling. The interviewers are then given specific instructions as to which 
households in their assigned area they must conduct interviews in and the order that 
they must follow.
The efficiency of stratified sampling compared with simple random sampling 
in terms of cost and time is clear. The members of the sample are clustered in well-
defined and easily manageable areas, significantly reducing the cost of conducting 
interviews as well as the response time needed to collect the data. For a large, het-
erogeneous nation like the United States, stratified sampling has generally proved to 
be a reliable way to collect national data.

Good news, bad news. When it comes to the connections between our lifestyle hab-
its (diet, exercise, smoking, pill popping, etc.) and our health and well-being (lon-
gevity, weight control, chances of disease, etc.), the news is full of both good and 
bad: “coffee is good for you—you will live longer if you drink a few cups a day”; 
“HRT is bad for you—it increases your chances of getting breast cancer.”
How much should we trust these types of pronouncements? And what should 
we do when the information is conflicting (“X is good for you; Oops! On second 
thought, X is really bad for you; No, actually X is kind of good for you after all!”). 
Our next example illustrates how serious this issue can be.

HormonE rEPlacEmEnt tHEraPy
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is basically a form of estrogen replacement 
and is an accepted and widely used therapy to treat the symptoms of menopause in 
women. No controversy there. The question is whether women after menopause 
should continue HRT, and if so, what are the benefits of doing so? Here is a chronol-
ogy of the answers:
n Nurses’ Health Study, 1985: Good news! Women taking estrogen had one-third 
the number of heart attacks than women who didn’t. Hormone replacement 
therapy (estrogen plus progestin) becomes a highly recommended treatment for 
preventing heart disease (as well as osteoporosis) in postmenopausal women. 
By 2001, 15 million prescriptions for HRT are filled annually and about 5 mil-
lion are for postmenopausal women.
n Women’s Health Initiative Study, 2002: Bad news! Hormone replacement ther-
apy significantly increases the risk of heart disease and breast cancer, and is a 
risk factor for stroke. Its only health benefit is for preventing osteoporosis and 
possibly colorectal cancer. Hormone replacement therapy is no longer recom-
mended as a general therapy for older women (it is still recommended as an 
effective therapy for women during menopause).
n Women’s Health Initiative Follow-up, 2007: Mixed news! Hormone replacement 
therapy offers protection against heart disease for women that start taking it 
during menopause but increases the risk of heart disease for women who start 
taking it after menopause.
n Women’s Health Initiative Follow-up II, 2009: Bad news! Hormone replacement 
therapy significantly increases the risk of breast cancer in menopausal and post-
menopausal women.
The relation between HRT and heart disease or breast can-
cer in older women is one of thousands of important cause-and-
effect questions that still remain unanswered, and women are left 
to struggle weighing the good and the bad. Why?
A typical cause-and-effect statement (at least the kind that 
makes the news) takes the form treatment X causes result Y. The 
treatment X might be a food, a drug, a therapy, or a lifestyle hab-
it such as exercise, and the result Y a disease, a health benefit, 
or a behavioral change. These types of questions are incredibly 
difficult to answer definitively because there is a huge difference 
between correlation and causation, and yet it is very difficult 
to separate one from the other. A correlation (or  association) 
between two events X and Y occurs when there is an observed 
mutual relationship between the two events. A causation (or 
 casual relationship) between X and Y occurs when one event is 
the cause of the other one.
An observed correlation between two events X and Y [Fig. 2(a)] can  occur 
for many reasons: Maybe X is the cause and Y is the effect [Fig. 2(b)], or Y is the 
cause and X is the effect [Fig. 2(c)], or both X and Y are effects of a common 
cause C [Fig. 2(d)], or X and Y are the effects of two different correlated causes 
[Fig. 2(e)]. It follows that trying to establish a cause-and-effect relationship be-
tween two events just because a correlation is observed is tricky to say the least.
There is very strong evidence that 
estrogen plus progestin causes breast 
cancer. You start women on hor-
mones and within five years their risk 
of breast cancer is clearly elevated. 
You stop the hormones and within 
one year their risk is essentially back 
to normal. It’s reasonably convincing 
cause and effect data.

In general, finding a correlation between a treatment and an observed result 
is easy. The difficult part is establishing that the correlation is indeed due to some 
cause-effect relation. In the rest of this section we will illustrate the complexities of 
establishing cause and effect from observed correlations.

doEs drinking coffEE HElP you livE longEr?
In mid May 2012 a big story made the headlines: a major study showing that drink-
ing coffee helps you live longer. For those of us who often wonder—as we sip an-
other double espresso—what our coffee addiction does to us, this was a great bit of 
news. Can it really be true?
The coffee finding came from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study—a very large 
observational study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). In an obser-
vational study individuals are tracked for an extensive period of time and records are 
kept of their lifestyle factors (diet, physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, etc.) 
as well as disease rates and general health. Whenever a correlation between a lifestyle 
factor X and an observed change Y is found, a hypothesis is formulated: Could X be a 
cause of Y? Let’s check out the ‘coffee causes longevity hypothesis’ in a little more detail.
The NIH-AARP study involved 400,000 subjects living in the United States 
aged 50 to 71. Initially, the subjects were given an extensive survey concerning their 
health, nutrition, and lifestyle habits and then were tracked for 12 years for health 
status, life span, and causes of death if they had indeed died.
One of the lifestyle factors considered was coffee consumption, and the initial 
correlation found by the researchers was that the non-coffee drinkers lived longer 
than coffee drinkers. (During the 12-year period of the study, 19% of the men and 
15% of the women coffee-drinkers died, but among non-coffee drinkers the death 
rates dropped to 13% men and 10% women.) These correlations would point to-
wards the hypothesis that coffee is bad for you, but it turned out that coffee drink-
ing is also positively correlated with smoking: Coffee drinkers are more likely to 
be smokers than non-coffee drinkers. This raises the possibility that it is really the 
smoking that is bad for you and not the coffee. Similar correlations were found be-
tween coffee drinking and a host of other lifestyle factors: Coffee drinkers consume 
more alcohol, consume more red meat, have lower levels of physical activity, and 
consume fewer fruits and vegetables. Any one of these (or a combination of several) 
could be the cause of the observed effect.
However, once the researchers controlled for smoking (comparing longevity 
among non-smoking coffee drinkers with longevity among non-smoking noncoffee 
drinkers) the tables were turned: Coffee consumption was correlated with living 
longer and with a reduced incidence of cancer and heart disease. The same posi-
tive correlation showed up when the researchers controlled for other confounding 
variables—alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI), age, ethnicity, marital status, 
physical activity, consumption of red meat, and (for postmenopausal women) use or 
nonuse of HRT. The general conclusion of the study was that men who drank two or 
more cups of a day had a 10% better chance of living through the study than those 
who didn’t, and for women the advantage was 13%.
While the NIH-AARP study raises the tantalizing possibility that coffee might 
help us live longer and healthier lives, the evidence is far from conclusive. Observa-
tional studies cannot prove a cause and effect relationship—they can only suggest 
the possibility that one might exist. The NIH-AARP study had many flaws—the 
lifestyle factors were self-reported and people are known to fudge the truth (if you 
smoked three packs a day, would your really put that down in a questionnaire?), 
the lifestyle data was collected only at the beginning of the study (what about those 
who changed their lifestyle in the middle of the study?), and there were many other 
possible confounding variables (high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type of health 
insurance, etc.) that were not considered. No doubt there will be follow-up studies

to clarify things a bit. In the meantime, if you are a coffee drinker enjoy your cup of 
java. If you are not, don’t start now.
One of the problems with cause and effect findings is that they often get a lot of cov-
erage in the press—the more surprising and unexpected the finding the more coverage 
it gets. Some findings can result in a major shift in public health policy, and this is a seri-
ous issue when the finding turns out to be false. This is illustrated in our next example.

tHE alar scarE
Alar is a chemical used by apple growers to regulate the rate at which apples ripen. Until 
1989, practically all apples sold in grocery stores were sprayed with Alar. But in 1989 
Alar became bad news, denounced in newspapers and on TV as a potent cancer-causing 
agent and a primary cause of cancer in children. As a result of these reports, people 
stopped buying apples, schools all over the country removed apple juice from their 
lunch menus, and the Washington State apple industry lost an estimated $375 million.
The case against Alar was based on a single 1973 study in which laboratory mice 
were exposed to the active chemicals in Alar. The dosage used in the study was eight 
times greater than the maximum tolerated dosage—a concentration at which even 
harmless substances can produce tissue damage. In fact, a child would have to eat 
about 200,000 apples a day to be exposed to an equivalent dosage of the chemical. Sub-
sequent studies conducted by the National Cancer Institute and the Environmental 
Protection Agency failed to show any correlation between Alar and cancer in children.
While it is generally accepted now that Alar does not cause cancer, because of 
potential legal liability, it is no longer used. The Alar scare turned out to be a false 
alarm based on a poor understanding of the statistical evidence. Unfortunately, it 
left in its wake a long list of casualties, among them the apple industry, the product’s 
manufacturer, the media, and the public’s confidence in the system.
clinical studies
A second approach to establishing a cause and effect relationship between a treat-
ment and a result is a clinical study (or clinical trial). Clinical studies are used to 
demonstrate that a treatment X (usually a drug, a vaccine, or a therapy) is effec-
tive. (For simplicity we will call X an effective treatment if X helps cure a disease or 
improves the condition of a patient.) The only way to be sure that X is an effective 
treatment is to isolate X from other possible causes (confounding variables) that 
could explain the same effect.
The classic way to isolate a treatment X from all other possible confounding 
variables is to use a controlled study. In a controlled study the subjects are divided 
into groups—some groups (called the treatment groups) are the ones that get the 
treatment; the other groups (called the control groups) don’t get the treatment. The 
control groups are there for comparison purposes only—they give the experiment-
ers a baseline to see if the treatment groups do better or not. If the treatment groups 
show better results than the control groups, then there is good reason to suspect that 
the treatment might be an effective treatment.
To eliminate the many potential confounding variables that can bias its results, 
a well-designed controlled study should have control and treatment groups that are 
similar in every characteristic other than the fact that one group is being treated and 
the other one is not. (It would be a very bad idea, for example, to have a treatment 
group that is all female and a control group that is all male.) The most reliable way 
to get equally representative treatment and control groups is to use a randomized 
controlled study. In a randomized controlled study, the subjects are assigned to the 
treatment group or the control group randomly.
When the randomization part of a randomized controlled study is properly done, 
treatment and control groups can be assumed to be statistically similar. But there 
is still one major difference between the two groups that can significantly affect the 
479

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
validity of the study—a critical confounding variable known as the placebo effect. The 
placebo effect follows from the generally accepted principle that just the idea that one 
is getting a treatment can produce positive results. Thus, when subjects in a study are 
getting a pill or a vaccine or some other kind of treatment, how can the researchers 
separate positive results that are consequences of the treatment itself from those that 
might be caused by the placebo effect? When possible, the standard way to handle 
this problem is to give the control group a placebo. A placebo is a make-believe form 
of treatment—a harmless pill, an injection of saline solution, or any other fake type 
of treatment intended to look like the real treatment. A controlled study in which the 
subjects in the control group are given a placebo is called a controlled placebo study.
By giving all subjects a seemingly equal treatment (the treatment group gets the 
real treatment and the control group gets a placebo that looks like the real treat-
ment), we do not eliminate the placebo effect but rather control it—whatever its 
effect might be, it affects all subjects equally. It goes without saying that the use 
of placebos is pointless if the subject knows he or she is getting a placebo. Thus, a 
second key element of a good controlled placebo study is that all subjects be kept in 
the dark as to whether they are being treated with a real treatment or a placebo. A 
study in which neither the members of the treatment group nor the members of the 
control group know to which of the two groups they belong is called a blind study.
Blindness is a key requirement of a controlled placebo study but not the only 
one. To keep the interpretation of the results (which can often be ambiguous) to-
tally objective, it is important that the scientists conducting the study and collecting 
the data also be in the dark when it comes to who got the treatment and who got 
the placebo. A controlled placebo study in which neither the subjects nor the scien-
tists conducting the experiment know which subjects are in the treatment group and 
which are in the control group is called a double-blind study.
Our next case study illustrates one of the most famous and important double-
blind studies in the annals of clinical research.
casE study 3  ThE 1954 SALk PoLIo VACCInE FIELD TRIALS
Polio (infantile paralysis) has been practically eradicated in the Western world. In 
the first half of the twentieth century, however, it was a major public health prob-
lem. Over one-half million cases of polio were reported between 1930 and 1950, and 
the actual number may have been considerably higher.
Because polio attacks mostly children and because its effects can be so serious 
(paralysis or death), eradication of the disease became a top public health priority in 
the United States. By the late 1940s, it was known that polio is a virus and, as such, can 
best be treated by a vaccine that is itself made up of a virus. The vaccine virus can be a 
closely related virus that does not have the same harmful effects, or it can be the actual 
virus that produces the disease but that has been killed by a special treatment. The 
former is known as a live-virus vaccine, the latter as a killed-virus vaccine. In response 
to either vaccine, the body is known to produce antibodies that remain in the system 
and give the individual immunity against an attack by the real virus.
Both the live-virus and the killed-virus approaches have their advantages and 
disadvantages. The live-virus approach produces a stronger reaction and better im-
munity, but at the same time, it is also more likely to cause a harmful reaction and, 
in some cases, even to produce the very disease it is supposed to prevent. The killed-
virus approach is safer in terms of the likelihood of producing a harmful reaction, 
but it is also less effective in providing the desired level of immunity.
These facts are important because they help us understand the extraordinary 
amount of caution that went into the design of the study that tested the effectiveness 
of the polio vaccine. By 1953, several potential vaccines had been developed, one 
of the more promising of which was a killed-virus vaccine developed by Jonas Salk 
at the University of Pittsburgh. The killed-virus approach was chosen because there 
was a great potential risk in testing a live-virus vaccine in a large-scale study. (A 
large-scale study was needed to collect enough information on polio, which, in the 
1950s, had a rate of incidence among children of about 1 in 2000.)

The testing of any new vaccine or drug creates many ethical dilemmas that have 
to be taken into account in the design of the study. With a killed-virus vaccine 
the risk of harmful consequences produced by the vaccine itself is small, so one pos-
sible approach would have been to distribute the vaccine widely among the popula-
tion and then follow up on whether there was a decline in the national incidence of 
polio in subsequent years. This approach, which was not possible at the time because 
supplies were limited, is called the vital statistics approach and is the simplest way to 
test a vaccine. This is essentially the way the smallpox vaccine was determined to be 
effective. The problem with such an approach for polio is that polio is an epidemic 
type of disease, which means that there is a great variation in the incidence of the 
disease from one year to the next. In 1952, there were close to 60,000 reported cases 
of polio in the United States, but in 1953, the number of reported cases had dropped 
to almost half that (about 35,000). Since no vaccine or treatment was used, the cause 
of the drop was the natural variability typical of epidemic diseases. But if an inef-
fective polio vaccine had been tested in 1952 without a control group, the observed 
effect of a large drop in the incidence of polio in 1953 could have been incorrectly 
interpreted as statistical evidence that the vaccine worked.
The final decision on how best to test the effectiveness of the Salk vaccine was 
left to an advisory committee of doctors, public officials, and statisticians convened 
by the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis and the Public Health Service. 
It was a highly controversial decision, but at the end, a large-scale, randomized, 
double-blind, controlled placebo study was chosen. Approximately 750,000 chil-
dren were randomly selected to participate in the study. Of these, about 340,000 
declined to participate, and another 8500 dropped out in the middle of the experi-
ment. The remaining children were randomly divided into two groups—a treat-
ment group and a control group—with approximately 200,000 children in each 
group. Neither the families of the children nor the researchers collecting the data 
knew if a particular child was getting the actual vaccine or a shot of harmless so-
lution. The latter was critical because polio is not an easy disease to diagnose—it 
comes in many different forms and degrees. Sometimes it can be a borderline call, 
and if the doctor collecting the data had prior knowledge of whether the subject 
had received the real vaccine or the placebo, the diagnosis could have been sub-
jectively tipped one way or the other.
A summary of the results of the Salk vaccine field trials is shown in Table 2. 
These data were taken as conclusive evidence that the Salk vaccine was an effective 
treatment for polio, and on the basis of this study, a massive inoculation campaign 
was put into effect. Today, all children are routinely inoculated against polio, and 
the disease has essentially been eradicated in the United States.

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
In this chapter we have discussed different methods for collecting data. In principle, 
the most accurate method is a census, a method that relies on collecting data from 
each member of the population. In most cases, because of considerations of cost and 
time, a census is an unrealistic strategy. When data are collected from only a subset 
of the population (called a sample), the data collection method is called a survey. The 
most important rule in designing good surveys is to eliminate or minimize sample bias. 
Today, almost all strategies for collecting data are based on surveys in which the laws 
of chance are used to determine how the sample is selected, and these methods for 
collecting data are called random sampling methods. Random sampling is the best 
way known to minimize or eliminate sample bias. Two of the most common random 
sampling methods are simple random sampling and stratified sampling. In some spe-
cial situations, other more complicated types of random sampling can be used.
Sometimes identifying the sample is not enough. In cases in which cause-and-
effect questions are involved, the data may come to the surface only after an exten-
sive study has been carried out. The critical issue in establishing that there is a true 
cause and effect relation between two events is to distinguish between correlations 
and causations. The two most commonly used strategies for doing this are observa-
tional studies and controlled double-blind placebo studies. Both of these strategies 
are nowadays used (and sometimes abused) to settle issues affecting every aspect 
of our lives. We can thank this area of statistics for many breakthroughs in social 
science, medicine, and public health, as well as for the constant and dire warnings 
about our health, our diet, and against practically anything that is fun.

pond. Let’s suppose that you first capture n1 = 500 fish, tag 
them, and throw them back into the pond. After a couple of 
days you go back to the pond and capture n2 = 120 fish, of 
which k = 30 are tagged. Estimate the number of fish in the 
pond.
 8. To estimate the population in a rookery, 4965 fur seal pups 
were captured and tagged in early August. In late August, 
900 fur seal pups were captured. Of these, 218 had been 
tagged. Based on these figures, estimate the population of 
fur seal pups in the rookery. [Source: Chapman and Johnson,

 9. To count whale populations, the “capture” is done by 
means of a photograph, and the “tagging” is done by iden-
tifying each captured whale through their unique individual 
pigmentation and markings. To estimate the population 
of gray whales in a region of the Pacific between North-
ern California and Southeast Alaska, 121 gray whales 
were “captured” and “tagged” in 2007. In 2008, 172 whales 
were “recaptured.” Of these, 76 had been “tagged” in the 
2007 survey. Based on these figures, estimate the popula-
tion of gray whales in the region. [Source: Calambokidis,

national Whaling Commission Scientific Committee, 2010.]
 10. The critically endangered Maui’s dolphin is currently re-
stricted to a relatively small stretch of coastline along the 
west coast of New Zealand’s North Island. The dolphins 
are “captured” by just collecting samples of DNA and 
“tagged” by identifying their DNA fingerprint. A 2010–
2011 capture-recapture study “captured” and “tagged” 26 
Maui’s dolphins in 2010. In 2011, 27 Maui’s dolphins were 
“recaptured” and through their DNA, 12 were identified 
as having been “tagged” in 2010. Based on these figures, 
estimate the population of Maui’s dolphins in 2011. [Source:

 16. An audit is performed on last year’s 15,000 student-aid 
packages given out by the financial aid office at Tasmania 
State University. Roughly half of the student-aid packages 
were less than $1000 (Category 1), about one-fourth were 
between $1000 and $5000 (Category 2), and another quar-
ter were over $5000 (Category 3). For each audit described 
below, name the sampling method that best describes it. 
Choose your answer from the following: (A) simple random 
sampling, (B) convenience sampling, (C) quota sampling, 
(D) stratified sampling, (E) census.
 
(a) The auditor reviews all 15,000 student-aid packages.
 
(b) The auditor randomly selects 200 student-aid packages 
in Category 1, 100 student-aid packages in Category 2, 
and 100 transactions in Category 3.
 
(c) The auditor reviews the first 500 student-aid packages 
that he comes across.
 
(d) The auditor first separates the student- aid packages by 
school (Agriculture, Arts and Humanities, Engineer-
ing, Nursing, Social Science, Science, and Mathematics). 
Three of these schools are selected at random and fur-
ther subdivided by major. Ten majors are randomly se-
lected within each selected school, and then 20 students 
are randomly selected from each of the selected majors.
Exercises 17 through 20 refer to the following story: The city of 
Cleansburg has 8325 registered voters. There is an election for 
mayor of Cleansburg, and there are three candidates for the posi-
tion: Smith, Jones, and Brown. The day before the election a tele-
phone poll of 680 randomly chosen registered voters produced the 
following results: 306 people surveyed indicated that they would 
vote for Smith, 272 indicated that they would vote for Jones and 
102 indicated that they would vote for Brown.
 17. (a) Describe the population for this survey.
 
(b) Describe the sample for this survey.
 
(c) Name the sampling method used for this survey.
 18. (a) Give the sampling proportion for this survey.
 
(b) Give the sample statistic estimating the percentage of 
the vote going to Smith.
 19. Given that in the actual election Smith received 42% of the 
vote, Jones 43% of the vote, and Brown 15% of the vote, find 
the sampling errors in the survey expressed as percentages.
 20. Do you think that the sampling error in this example was 
due primarily to sampling bias or to chance? Explain your 
answer.
Exercises 21 through 24 refer to the following story: The 1250 stu-
dents at Eureka High School are having an election for Home-
coming King. The candidates are Tomlinson (captain of the foot-
ball team), Garcia (class president), and Marsalis (member of the 
marching band). At the football game a week before the election, 
a pre-election poll was taken of students as they entered the sta-
dium gates. Of the students who attended the game, 203 planned 
to vote for Tomlinson, 42 planned to vote for Garcia, and 105 
planned to vote for Marsalis.
 21. (a) Describe the sample for this survey.
 
(b) Give the sampling proportion for this survey.
Exercises 11 and 12 refer to Chapman’s correction. Chapman’s 
correction is a small tweak on the final formula used in two-sample  
estimation. Using the same three input variables n1 (size of the 
first sample), n2 (size of the second sample), and k (number of 
tagged individuals in the second sample), Chapman’s correction 
is given by the formula k + 1
n2 + 1 
n1 + 1
N + 1. Solving for N gives Chap man’s
correction estimate for the size of the population.
 11. Use Chapman’s correction to estimate the population of gray 
whales described in Exercise 9. Compare the two answers.
 12. Use Chapman’s correction to estimate the population of Maui’s 
dolphins described in Exercise 10. Compare the two answers.
 13. Starting in 2004, a study to determine the number of lake stur-
geon on Rainy River and Lake of the Woods on the United  
States–Canada border was conducted by the Canadian  
Ministry of Natural Resources, the Minnesota Department 
of Natural Resources, and the Rainy River First Nations. 
Using the capture-recapture method, the size of the pop-
ulation of lake sturgeon on Rainy River and Lake of the 
Woods was estimated at N = 160,286. In the capture phase 
of the study, 1700 lake sturgeon were caught, tagged, and 
released. Of these tagged sturgeon, seven were recaptured 
during the recapture phase of the study. Based on these fig-
ures, estimate the number of sturgeon caught in the recap-
ture phase of the study. [Source: Dan Gauthier, “Lake of 
the Woods Sturgeon Population Recovering,” Daily Miner 
and News (Kenora, Ont.), June 11, 2005, p. 31.]
 14. A 2004 study conducted at Utah Lake using the capture-
recapture method estimated the carp population in the lake 
to be about 1.1 million. Over a period of 15 days, workers 
captured, tagged, and released 24,000 carp. In the recap-
ture phase of the study 10,300 carp were recaptured. Esti-
mate how many of the carp that were recaptured had tags.

 15. Name the sampling method that best describes each situ-
ation. Choose your answer from the following (A) simple 
random sampling, (B) convenience sampling, (C) quota 
sampling, (D) stratified sampling, (E) census.
 
(a) George wants to know how the rest of the class did on 
the last quiz. He peeks at the scores of a few students 
sitting right next to him. Based on what he sees, he con-
cludes that nobody did very well.
 
(b) Eureka High School has 400 freshmen, 300 sopho-
mores, 300 juniors, and 200 seniors. The student news-
paper conducts a poll asking students if the football 
coach should be fired. The student newspaper random-
ly selects 20 freshmen, 15 sophomores, 15 juniors, and 
10 seniors for the poll.
 
(c) For the last football game of the season, the coach 
chooses the three captains by putting the names of all 
the players in a hat and drawing three names. (Maybe 
that’s why they are trying to fire him!)
 
(d) For the last football game of the season, the coach 
chooses the three captains by putting the names of all 
the seniors in a hat and drawing three names.

Exercises 29 through 32 refer to the following story: The dean 
of students at Tasmania State University wants to determine how 
many undergraduates at TSU are familiar with a new financial aid 
program offered by the university. There are 15,000 undergradu-
ates at TSU, so it is too expensive to conduct a census. The follow-
ing sampling method is used to choose a representative sample of 
undergraduates to poll. Start with the registrar’s alphabetical list-
ing containing the names of all undergraduates. Randomly pick 
a number between 1 and 100, and count that far down the list. 
Take that name and every 100th name after it. For example, if the 
random number chosen is 73, then pick the 73rd, 173rd, 273rd, 
and so forth, names on the list. (The sampling method illustrated 
in this survey is known as systematic sampling.)
 29. (a)  Compare and contrast the sampling frame and the tar-
get population for this survey.
 
(b) Give the exact N-value of the population.
 30. (a) Find the sampling proportion.
 
(b) Suppose that the survey had a response rate of 90%. 
Find the size n of the sample.
 31. (a)  Explain why the method used for choosing the sample 
is not simple random sampling.
 
(b) If 100% of those responding claimed that they were 
not familiar with the new financial aid program offered 
by the university, is this result more likely due to sam-
pling variability or to sample bias? Explain.
 32. (a)  Suppose that the survey had a response rate of 90% and 
that 108 students responded that they were not familiar 
with the new financial aid program. Give a statistic for 
the total number of students at the university who were 
not familiar with the new financial aid program.
 
(b) Do you think the results of this survey will be reliable? 
Explain.
Exercises 33 and 34 refer to the following story: An orange grow-
er wishes to compute the average yield from his orchard. The 
orchard contains three varieties of trees: 50% of his trees are of 
variety A, 25% of variety B, and 25% of variety C.
 33. (a)  Suppose that the grower samples randomly from 300 
trees of variety A, 150 trees of variety B, and 150 trees 
of variety C. What type of sampling is being used?
 
(b) Suppose that the grower selects for his sample a 10 by 
30 rectangular block of 300 trees of variety A, a 10 by 
15 rectangular block of 150 trees of variety B, and a 10 
by 15 rectangular block of 150 trees of variety C. What 
type of sampling is being used?
 34. (a)  Suppose that in his survey, the grower found that each 
tree of variety A averages 100 oranges, each tree of va-
riety B averages 50 oranges, and each tree of variety 
 22. Name the sampling method used for this survey.
 23. (a)  Compare and contrast the population and the sampling 
frame for this survey.
 
(b) Is the sampling error a result of sampling variability or

(b) A week after this survey, Garcia was elected Home-
coming King with 51% of the vote, Marsalis got 30% of 
the vote, and Tomlinson came in last with 19% of the 
vote. Find the sampling errors in the survey expressed 
as percentages.
Exercises 25 through 28 refer to the following story: The Cleans-
burg Planning Department is trying to determine what percent of 
the people in the city want to spend public funds to revitalize the 
downtown mall. To do so, the department decides to conduct a 
survey. Five professional interviewers are hired. Each interview-
er is asked to pick a street corner of his or her choice within the 
city limits, and every day between 4:00 P.M. and 6:00 P.M. the 
interviewers are supposed to ask each passerby if he or she wish-
es to respond to a survey sponsored by Cleansburg City Hall. If 
the response is yes, the follow-up question is asked: Are you in 
favor of spending public funds to revitalize the downtown mall? 
The interviewers are asked to return to the same street corner as 
many days as are necessary until each has conducted a total of 
100 interviews. The results of the survey are shown in Table 3.

Exercises 41 through 44 refer to a clinical study conducted at the 
Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center on the effec-
tiveness of knee surgery to cure degenerative arthritis (osteoar-
thritis) of the knee. Of the 324 individuals who met the inclusion 
criteria for the study, 144 declined to participate. The researchers 
randomly divided the remaining 180 subjects into three groups: 
One group received a type of arthroscopic knee surgery called 
debridement; a second group received a type of arthroscopic knee 
surgery called lavage; and a third group received skin incisions to 
make it look like they had had arthroscopic knee surgery, but no 
actual surgery was performed. The patients in the study did not 
know which group they were in and in particular did not know 
if they were receiving the real surgery or simulated surgery. All 
the patients who participated in the study were evaluated for two 
years after the procedure. In the two-year follow-up, all three 
groups said that they had slightly less pain and better knee move-
ment, but the “fake” surgery group often reported the best results.

(c) Describe the treatment group(s) in this study.
 43. (a)  Could this study be considered a randomized con-
trolled study? Explain.
 
(b) Was this Study blind, double blind, or neither?
 44. As a result of this study, the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs issued an advisory to its doctors recommending that 
they stop using arthroscopic knee surgery for patients suf-
fering from osteoarthritis. Do you agree or disagree with 
the advisory? Explain your answer.
Exercises 45 through 48 refer to a clinical trial named APPROVe 
designed to determine whether Vioxx, a medication used for ar-
thritis and acute pain, was effective in preventing the recurrence of 
colorectal polyps in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas. 
APPROVe was conducted between 2002 and 2003 and involved 
2586 participants, all of whom had a history of colorectal adeno-
mas. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: 
1287 were given 25 milligrams of Vioxx daily for the duration of the 
clinical trial (originally intended to last three years), and 1299 pa-
tients were given a placebo. Neither the participants nor the doctors 
involved in the clinical trial knew who was in which group. During 
the trial, 72 of the participants had cardiovascular events (mostly 
heart attacks or strokes). Later it was found that 46 of these people 
were from the group taking the Vioxx and only 26 were from the 
group taking the placebo. Based on these results, the clinical trial 
was stopped in 2003 and Vioxx was taken off the market in 2004.

Exercises 37 through 40 refer to the following story: The manu-
facturer of a new vitamin (vitamin X) decides to sponsor a study 
to determine the vitamin’s effectiveness in curing the common 
cold. Five hundred college students having a cold were recruited 
from colleges in the San Diego area and were paid to participate 
as subjects in this study. The subjects were each given two tab-
lets of vitamin X a day. Based on information provided by the 
subjects themselves, 457 of the 500 subjects were cured of their 
colds within 3 days. (The average number of days a cold lasts is 
4.87 days.) As a result of this study, the manufacturer launched an 
advertising campaign based on the claim that “vitamin X is more 
than 90% effective in curing the common cold.”

 56. In a different study on the effectiveness of the diphtheria 
serum conducted prior to Fibiger’s study, patients in one 
Copenhagen hospital were chosen to be in the treatment 
group and were given the new serum, whereas patients in a 
different Copenhagen hospital were chosen to be in the con-

Exercises 57 through 60 refer to a study conducted between 2008 
and 2010 on the effectiveness of saw palmetto fruit extracts at treat-
ing lower urinary tract symptoms in men with prostate enlarge-
ment. (Saw palmetto is a widely used over-the-counter supple-
ment for treating urinary tract symptoms.) In the study, 369 men 
aged 45 years or older were randomly divided into a group taking 
a daily placebo and a group taking saw palmetto. Participants 
were nonpaid volunteers recruited at 11 North American sites.  
All had moderately impaired urinary flow. Because the saw pal-
metto extract has a mild odor, the doses were administered using 
gelcaps to eliminate the odor. In an analysis of the 306 men who 
completed the 72-week trial, both groups had similar small im-
provements in mean symptom scores, but saw palmetto conferred 
no benefit over placebo on symptom scores or on any secondary 
outcomes. [Source: Journal of the American Medical Associa-

Exercises 49 through 52 refer to a study on the effectiveness of an 
HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine conducted between Oc-
tober 1998 and November 1999. HPV is the most common sexu-
ally transmitted infection—more than 20 million Americans are 
infected with HPV—but most HPV infections are benign, and in 
most cases infected individuals are not even aware they are infect-
ed. (On the other hand, some HPV infections can lead to cervical 
cancer in women.) The researchers recruited 2392 women from 
16 different centers across the United States to participate in the 
study through advertisements on college campuses and in the sur-
rounding communities. To be eligible to participate in the study, 
the subjects had to meet the following criteria: (1) be a female 
between 16 and 23 years of age, (2) not be pregnant, (3) have no 
prior abnormal Pap smears, and (4) report to have had sexual 
relations with no more than five men. At each center, half of the 
participants were randomly selected to receive the HPV vaccine, 
and the other half received a placebo injection. After 17.4 months, 
the incidence of HPV infection was 3.8 per 100 woman-years at 
risk in the placebo group and 0 per 100 woman-years at risk in the 
vaccine group. In addition, all nine cases of HPV-related cervi-
cal precancerous growths occurred among the placebo recipients.

Exercises 53 through 56 refer to a landmark study conducted in 
1896 in Denmark by Dr. Johannes Fibiger, who went on to receive 
the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1926. The purpose of the study was 
to determine the effectiveness of a new serum for treating diphthe-
ria, a common and often deadly respiratory disease in those days. 
Fibiger conducted his study over a one-year period (May 1896–
April 1897) in one particular Copenhagen hospital. New diphtheria 
patients admitted to the hospital received different treatments based 
on the day of admission. In one set of days (call them “even” days 
for convenience), the patients were treated with the new serum daily 
and received the standard treatment. Patients admitted on alternate 
days (the “odd” days) received just the standard treatment. Over 
the one-year period of the study, eight of the 239 patients admitted 
on the “even” days and treated with the serum died, whereas 30 of 
the 245 patients admitted on the “odd” days died.

 66. Leading-question bias. The way the questions in many sur-
veys are phrased can itself be a source of bias. When a ques-
tion is worded in such a way as to predispose the respondent 
to provide a particular response, the results of the survey 
are tainted by a special type of bias called leading-question 
bias. The following is an extreme hypothetical situation in-
tended to drive the point home.
 
 In an effort to find out how the American taxpayer feels 
about a tax increase, the Institute for Tax Reform conducts 
a “scientific” one-question poll.
 
 Are you in favor of paying higher taxes to bail the federal 
government out of its disastrous economic policies and its 
mismanagement of the federal budget? Yes____. No____.
 
 Ninety-five percent of the respondents answered no.
 
(a) Explain why the results of this survey might be invalid.
 
(b) Rephrase the question in a neutral way. Pay particular 
attention to highly charged words.
 
(c) Make up your own (more subtle) example of leading- 
question bias. Analyze the critical words that are the 
cause of bias.

Pete Rose is ineligible for baseball’s Hall of Fame because 
of charges that he gambled on baseball games. Do you 
think he should or should not be eligible for admission to 
the Hall of Fame?
n   As you may know, former Major League Baseball player 
Shoeless Joe Jackson is ineligible for baseball’s Hall of 
Fame because of charges that he took money from gam-
blers in exchange for fixing the 1919 World Series. Do you 
think he should or should not be eligible for admission to 
the Hall of Fame?
 
 The order in which the questions were asked was random: 
Approximately half of the people polled were asked about 
Rose first and Jackson second; the other half were asked 
about Jackson first and Rose second. When the order of 
the questions was Rose first and Jackson second, 64% of 
the respondents said that Rose should be eligible for admis-
sion to the Hall of Fame and 33% said that Jackson should 
be eligible for admission to the Hall of Fame. When the 
order of the questions was Jackson first and Rose second, 
52% said that Rose should be eligible for admission to the 
Hall of Fame and 45% said that Jackson should be eligible 
for admission to the Hall of Fame. Explain why you think 
each player’s support for eligibility was less (by 12% in each 
case) when the player was second in the order of the ques-
tions.
 68. Today, most consumer marketing surveys are conducted 
by telephone. In selecting a sample of households that are 
representative of all the households in a given geographical 
area, the two basic techniques used are (1) randomly select-
ing telephone numbers to call from the local telephone di-
rectory or directories and (2) using a computer to randomly 
generate seven-digit numbers to try that are compatible 
with the local phone numbers.
36 quarters, 45 nickels, and 69 dimes. Using a permanent 
ink marker you tag each of the 150 coins with a black dot 
and put the coins back in the jar, shake the jar really well 
to let the tagged coins mix well with the rest, and draw a 
second sample of 100 coins. The second sample has 28 quar-
ters, 29 nickels, and 43 dimes. Of these, 4 quarters, 5 nickels, 
and 8 dimes have black dots. Estimate how much money is 
in the jar. (Hint: You will need a separate calculation for 
estimating the quarters, nickels, and dimes in the jar.)
 62. One implicit assumption when using the capture-recapture 
method to estimate the size of a population is that the capture 
process is truly random, with all individuals having the same 
likelihood of being captured. Sometimes that is not true, 
and some populations have a large number of individuals  
that are “trap-happy” individuals (more prone to cap-
ture than others, more likely to take the bait, less cagey, 
slower, dumber, etc.). If that were the case, would the 
capture-recapture method be likely to underestimate or over-
estimate the size of the population? Explain your answer.
 63. One implicit assumption when using the capture-recapture 
method to estimate the size of a population is that when 
individuals are tagged in the capture stage, these individuals 
are not affected in any harmful way by the tags. Sometimes, 
though, tagged individuals become affected, with the tags 
often making them more likely prey to predators (imagine, 
for example, tagging fish with bright yellow tags that make 
them stand out or tagging a bird on a wing in such a way 
that it affects its ability to fly). If that were the case, would 
the capture-recapture method be likely to underestimate 
or overestimate the size of the population? Explain your 
answer.
 64. Informal surveys. In everyday life we are constantly involved 
in activities that can be described as informal surveys, often 
without even realizing it. Here are some examples.
 
(i) 
Al gets up in the morning and wants to know what kind 
of day it is going to be, so he peeks out the window. He 
doesn’t see any dark clouds, so he figures it’s not going 
to rain.
 
(ii) Betty takes a sip from a cup of coffee and burns her 
lips. She concludes that the coffee is too hot and de-
cides to add a tad of cold water to it.
 
(iii) Carla got her first Math 101 exam back with a C grade 
on it. The students sitting on each side of her also re-
ceived C grades. She concludes that the entire Math 
101 class received a C on the first exam.
 
 For each of the preceding examples,
 
(a) describe the population.
 
(b) discuss whether the sample is random or not.
 
(c) discuss the validity of the conclusions drawn. (There is no 
right or wrong answer to this question, but you should be 
able to make a reasonable case for your position.)
 65. Read the examples of informal surveys given in Exercise 64. 
Give three new examples of your own. Make them as differ-
ent as possible from the ones given in Exercise 64 [changing 
coffee to soup in (ii) is not a new example].

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
 
 Twelve percent of the respondents answered yes.
 
(a) Explain why the above figure might be unreliable.
 
(b) Can you think of ways in which a survey of this type 
might be designed so that more reliable information 
could be obtained? In particular, discuss who should be 
sponsoring the survey and how the interviews should 
be carried out.

 73. One of the problems with the capture-recapture method 
is that in some animal populations there are individuals 
that are trap-happy (easy to trap) and others that are more 
cagey and hard to trap. Too many trap-happy individuals 
can skew the data (see Exercise 62). A removal method is 
a method for estimating the N-value of a population that 
takes into account the existence of trap-happy individuals 
by trapping them and removing them. In the first “cap-
ture,” individuals from the general population are trapped, 
counted, and removed from the habitat so that they can’t 
be trapped again. In the “recapture,” individuals from the 
remaining population (those that had not been trapped 
before) are trapped and counted. The number of individu-
als trapped in the capture can be denoted by pN, where 
p denotes the fraction of the population trapped and N 
is the size of the population. The number of individuals 
left after the removal is 11 - p2N. If we assume that the 
number of individuals trapped in each capture represents 
the same fraction of the population, then the number of 
individuals trapped in the recapture should be p11 - p2N. 
From the two equations 1pN = number of individuals 
trapped in the capture; p11 - p2N = number of individuals 
trapped in the recapture) we can solve for N and get an 
estimate of the population.
 
  
Suppose 250 individuals are trapped in the capture 
stage and removed from the population, and 150 individu-
als are trapped in the recapture stage. Estimate the size of 
the population.
 74. Darroch’s method. is a method for estimating the size of 
a population using multiple (more than two) captures. 
For example, suppose that there are four captures of sizes  
n1, n2, n3, and n4, respectively, and let M be the total 
number of distinct individuals caught in the four captures 
(i.e., an individual that is captured in more than one cap-
ture is counted only once). Darroch’s method gives the 
estimate for N as the unique solution of the equation 
 
 11 - M
N2 = 11 -
n1

(a) Suppose that we are estimating the size of a popula-
tion of fish in a pond using four separate captures. 
The sizes of the captures are n1 = 30, n2 = 15, n3 = 22, 
and n4 = 45. The number of distinct fish caught is 
M = 75. Estimate the size of the population using Dar-
roch’s formula.
 
(b) Show that with just two captures Darroch’s method 
gives the same answer as the capture-recapture method.
 
(a) Briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of 
each technique. In your opinion, which of the two will 
produce the more reliable data? Explain.
 
(b) Suppose that you are trying to market burglar alarms in 
New York City. Which of the two techniques for select-
ing the sample would you use? Explain your reasons.
 69. The following two surveys were conducted in January 1991 
to assess how the American public viewed media coverage 
of the Persian Gulf war. Survey 1 was an Area Code 900 
telephone poll survey conducted by ABC News. Viewers 
were asked to call a certain 900 number if they believed 
that the media were doing a good job of covering the war 
and a different 900 number if they believed that the media 
were not doing a good job in covering the war. Each call 
cost 50 cents. Of the 60,000 respondents, 83% believed that 
the media were not doing a good job. Survey 2 was a tele-
phone poll of 1500 randomly selected households across the 
United States conducted by the Times-Mirror survey orga-
nization. In this poll, 80% of the respondents indicated that 
they approved of the press coverage of the war.
 
(a) Briefly discuss survey 1, indicating any possible types 
of bias.
 
(b) Briefly discuss survey 2, indicating any possible types 
of bias.
 
(c) Can you explain the discrepancy between the results of 
the two surveys?
 
(d) In your opinion, which of the two surveys gives the 
more reliable data?
 70. An article in the Providence Journal about automobile ac-
cident fatalities includes the following observation: “Forty-
two percent of all fatalities occurred on Friday, Saturday, 
and Sunday, apparently because of increased drinking on 
the weekends.”
 
(a) Give a possible argument as to why the conclusion 
drawn may not be justified by the data.
 
(b) Give a different possible argument as to why the con-
clusion drawn may be justified by the data after all.
 71. (a)  For the capture-recapture method to give a reasonable 
estimate of N, what assumptions about the two samples 
must be true?
 
(b) Give reasons why the assumptions in (a) may not hold 
true in many situations.
 72. Consider the following hypothetical survey designed to find 
out what percentage of people cheat on their income taxes.
 
Fifteen hundred taxpayers are randomly selected from 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rolls. These indi-
viduals are then interviewed in person by representa-
tives of the IRS and read the following statement.
 
“This survey is for information purposes only. Your 
answer will be held in strict confidence. Have you ever 
cheated on your income taxes? Yes____. No____.”

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
 1 what’s the latest?
In this project you are to do an in-depth report on a recent study. 
Find a recent article from a newspaper or news magazine report-
ing the results of a major study and write an analysis of the study. 
Discuss the extent to which the article gives the reader enough 
information to assess the validity of the study’s conclusions. If 
in your opinion there is information missing in the article, gen-
erate a list of questions that would help you further assess the 
validity of the study’s conclusions. Pay particular attention to 
the ideas and concepts discussed in this chapter, including the 
target population, sample size, sampling bias, randomness, con-
trols, and so on.
 2 the Placebo Effect: myth or reality?
There is no consensus among researchers conducting clinical 
studies as to the true impact of the placebo effect. According to 
some researchers, as many as 30% of patients in a clinical trial 
can be affected by it; according to others, the placebo effect is 
a myth.
Write a paper on the placebo effect. Discuss the history of 
this idea, the most recent controversies regarding whether it 
truly exists or not and why is it important to determine its true 
impact.
 3 Ethical issues in clinical studies
Until the world was exposed to the atrocities committed by 
Nazi physicians during World War II, there was little consen-
sus regarding the ethics of medical experiments involving hu-
man subjects. Following the trial of the Nazi physicians in 1946, 
the Nuremberg Code of Ethics was developed to deal with the 
ethics of clinical studies on human subjects. Sadly, unethical ex-
perimentation continued. In the Tuskegee syphilis study starting 
in 1932, 600 low-income African American males (400 infected  
with syphilis) were monitored. Even though a proven cure (pen-
icillin) became available in the 1950s, the study continued until 
1972 with participants denied treatment. As many as 100 sub-
jects died from the disease.
In this project you are to write a paper summarizing current 
ethical standards for the treatment of humans in experimental 
studies.

  (b)  Mainly sampling bias. The sampling frame is not representative

491

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
31. (a)  In simple random sampling, any two members of the population 
have as much chance of both being in the sample as any other 
two, but in this sample, two people with the same last name—
say Len Euler and Linda Euler—have no chance of being in the 
sample together.
  (b)  Sampling variability. The students sampled appear to be a rep-
resentative cross section of all TSU undergraduates.
33. (a) Stratified sampling.
(b) Quota sampling.
35. (a)  Label the crates with numbers 1 through 250. Select 20 of these 
numbers at random (put the 250 numbers in a hat and draw out 
20). Sample those 20 crates.
  (b) Select the top 20 crates in the shipment (those easiest to access).
  (c)  Randomly sample 6 crates from supplier A, 6 crates from sup-
plier B, and 8 crates from supplier C.
  (d)  Select any 6 crates from supplier A, any 6 crates from supplier 
B, and any 8 crates from supplier C.
25. (a) the citizens of Cleansburg
  (b)  The sampling frame is limited to that part of the target popula-
tion that passes by a city street corner between 4:00 p.m. and 
6:00 p.m.
27. (a)  The choice of street corner could make a great deal of differ-
ence in the responses collected.
  (b)  Interviewer D. We are assuming that people who live or work 
downtown are much more likely to answer yes than people in 
other parts of town.
  (c)  Yes, for two main reasons: (1) People out on the street between 
4 p.m. and 6 p.m. are not representative of the population at large. 
For example, office and white-collar workers are much more 
likely to be in the sample than homemakers and schoolteachers. 
(2) The five street corners were chosen by the interviewers, and 
the passersby are unlikely to represent a cross section of the city.
  (d)  No. No attempt was made to use quotas to get a representative 
cross section of the population.
29. (a)  The target population and the sampling frame both consist of 
all TSU undergraduates.
  (b) 15,000
51. (a)  The treatment group consisted of the women who received the 
HPV vaccine.
  (b)  This was a controlled placebo study because there was a control 
group that did not receive the treatment, but instead received a 
placebo injection. It was a randomized controlled study because 
the 2392 participants were randomly divided into the treatment 
and control groups. The study was likely double blind because 
neither the participants nor the medical personnel giving the 
injections knew who was in each group.
53. (a)  The target population consisted of all people suffering from 
diphtheria.
  (b)  The sampling frame consisted of the individuals admitted to 
that particular Copenhagen hospital between May 1896 and 
April 1897 and having serious diptheria symptoms.
55. (a)  The control group consisted of those patients admitted on 
the “odd” days who received just the standard treatment for 
diphtheria at the time. The treatment group consisted of those  
patients admitted on the “even” days who received both the 
new serum and the standard treatment.
  (b)  When the new serum was combined with the standard treat-
ment, it proved effective in treating diphtheria.
57. (a)  The target population consisted of men with prostate enlarge-
ment; particularly older men.
 
 (b)  The sampling frame consists of men aged 45 years or older hav-
ing moderately impaired urinary flow. It appears to be a repre-
sentative subset of the target population.
 59. (a)  The treatment group consisted of the group of volunteers that 
received saw palmetto daily. 
 
 (b)  The saw palmetto odor would be a dead give away as to who 
was getting the treatment and who was getting a placebo. To 
make the study truly blind, the odor had to be covered up. 
 
 (c)  Yes. There was a control group that received a placebo instead 
of the treatment, and the treatment group was randomized. We 
can infer the study was blind from the fact that an effort was 
made to hide the odor of the saw palmetto. From the descrip-
tion of the study there is no way to tell if the study was also 
double blind.

 cause and Effect
 37. (a)  The target population consisted of anyone who could have a 
cold and would consider buying vitamin X (i.e., pretty much all 
adults).
  (b)  The sampling frame consisted of college students in the San 
Diego area having a cold at the time.
 
 (c) The sample consisted of the 500 students that took vitamin X.
39. 1.  Using college students—they are not a representative cross sec-
tion of the population.
 
 2. Using subjects only from the San Diego area.
 
 3. Offering money as an incentive to participate.
 
 4.  Allowing self-reporting (the subjects themselves determine 
when their colds are over).
41. (a) All potential knee surgery patients.
  (b)  the 180 potential knee surgery patients at the Houston VA 
Medical Center who volunteered to be in the study
43. (a)  Yes. The 180 patients in the study were assigned to a treatment 
group at random.
  (b) Blind
45. The target population consisted of all people having a history of 
colorectal adenomas.
47. (a)  The treatment group consisted of the 1287 patients who were 
given 25 milligrams of Vioxx daily. The control group consisted 
of the 1299 patients who were given a placebo.
  (b)  This clinical study was a controlled placebo study because there 
was a control group that did not receive the treatment, but  
instead received a placebo. It was a randomized controlled 
study because the 2586 participants were randomly divided into 
the treatment and control groups. The study was double blind 
because neither the participants nor the doctors involved in the 
study knew who was in each group.
49. (a)  The target population consisted of women (particularly young 
women).
  (b)  The sampling frame consists of those women between 16 and 
23 years of age who are not at high risk for HPV infection (i.e., 
those women having no prior abnormal Pap smears and at most 
five previous male sexual partners). Pregnant women are also 
excluded from the sampling frame due to the risks involved.

Censuses, Surveys, Polls, and Studies 
  (c)  Both surveys seem to have produced unreliable data—survey 1 
overestimating the public’s dissapproval of the role played by 
the newsmedia and survey 2 overestimating the public’s support 
for the press coverage of the war.
  (d)  Any reasoned out answer should be acceptable. (Since Area 
Code 900 telephone polls are particularly unreliable, survey 2 
gets our vote.)
71. (a)  Both samples should be a representative cross section of the 
same population. In particular, it is essential that the first sam-
ple, after being released, be allowed to disperse evenly through-
out the population, and that the population should not change 
between the time of the capture and the time of the recapture.
  (b)  It is possible (especially when dealing with elusive types of 
animals) that the very fact that the animals in the first sample 
 allowed themselves to be captured makes such a sample biased 
(they could represent a slower, less cunning group). This type 
of bias is compounded with the animals that get captured the 
second time around. A second problem is the effect that the first 
capture can have on the captured animals. Sometimes the animal 
may be hurt (physically or emotionally), making it more (or less) 
likely to be captured the second time around. A third source of 
bias is the possibility that some of the tags will come off.
Jogging
 61. approx. $113.15 (252 quarters, 261 nickels, 371 dimes)
63. Capture-recapture would overestimate the true population. If the 
fraction of those tagged in the recapture appears lower than it is in 
reality, then the fraction of those tagged in the initial capture will 
also be computed as lower than the truth. This makes the total popu-
lation appear larger than it really is.
65. Answers will vary.
67. Consideration of one exception made them less likely to consider a 
second exception.
69. (a)  An Area Code 900 telephone poll represents an extreme case of 
selection bias. People who respond to these polls usually represent 
the extreme viewpoints (strongly for or strongly against), leaving 
out much of the middle of the road point of view. Economics also 
plays some role in the selection bias. (While 50 cents is not a lot of 
money anymore, poor people are much more likely to think twice 
before spending the money to express their opinion.)
  (b)  This survey was based on fairly standard modern-day polling 
techniques (random sample telephone interviews, etc.) but it 
had one subtle flaw. How reliable can a survey about the con-
duct of the newsmedia be when the survey itself is conducted 
by a newsmedia organization? (“The fox guarding the chicken-
coop” syndrome.)

The Data Show and Tell
In 2011 a total of 1,647,123 college-bound students took the SAT. 
Put them all in one place and you would have the fifth largest city 
in the United States—a third larger than Dallas and twice as large 
as San Francisco. Each of the 1,647,123 tests taken generated 
several numbers: individual sub scores in three separate subject areas 
(Mathematics, Critical Thinking, and Writing), and percentiles for each 
subject area plus a composite percentile for the entire test. Put it all 
together and you have more than 10 million numbers to play with—a 
vast sea of mysterious but potentially useful data.

 hen it comes to rapid mental processing, we humans do well with images 
and words, but not so well with numbers. Psychologists have found that 
a typical human mind can juggle the relationships between six, at most 
seven, numbers at one time. Anything beyond that requires a more deliberate and 
purposeful effort. Certainly, by the time you get to a dozen or more numbers, some 
organization and management of the data will be required. And what about manag-
ing and organizing a data set of more than 10 million numbers? No worries.
There are essentially two major strategies for describing a large data set. 
One of them is to take advantage of the human mind’s great talent for visualiza-
tion and describe the data using pictures (graphs and charts). In Section 1 we 
cover some of the standard graphical tools for describing data—bar charts, pic-
tograms, pie charts, and histograms—and discuss a few basic rules for when and 
how to use each. The second strategy for describing a large data set is to use nu-
merical summaries. While a few numbers can’t tell the full story behind 10 million 
numbers, it’s amazing how much mileage one can get from a few well-chosen nu-
merical summaries. In Section 
2 we cover the classic numerical 
summaries for a data set—
averages 
(means), 
medians, 
quartiles, percentiles, and five-
number summaries. All of these 
numerical summaries help us 
identify where the data set sits 
in relation to the possible val-
ues that the data could take 
and are called measures of loca-
tion. A second group of useful 
numbers consists of those that 
provide information about the 
spread of the data set. In Sec-
tion 3 we briefly discuss the 
three most commonly used 
measures of spread—the range, 
the interquartile range, and the 
standard deviation.

Graphs, Charts, and Numbers
The old adage “a picture is worth 1000 words” is even more valid when applied 
to numbers instead of words. A single, well-chosen graphical display can say 
a lot about the patterns that lie hidden within a bunch of numbers, especially 
when there are a lot of them numbers. OK, we are going to need a slightly more 
formal terminology than “them numbers,” so we start with a couple of basic 
definitions.
n Data set. A data set is a collection of numbers that represent all the values ob-
tained when measuring some characteristic of a population (such as a test score, 
a stock price, a sales figure, etc.). [Note: Technically speaking a data set is not 
a set because repeated numbers are included—in a real set, repeats are not 
 included.]
n Data point. Each of the individual numbers in a data set is called a data point. In 
all the data sets we will consider in this chapter, the data points will be rational 
numbers (either whole numbers, decimals, or percentages). We will let N de-
note the total number of data points in the data set, and we will refer to N as the 
size of the data set.
Creating a graphical representation of a data set 
is somewhat like taking a photograph, except that in-
stead of taking snapshots of people or nature we are 
creating a picture of the data. And, just like photog-
raphy is a skill that can be elevated into an art form, 
creating the most appropriate and efficient graph or 
chart for a data set is both a skill and an art. In this 
section we are only going to cover the most basic types 
of graphs and charts, and discuss when to use one or 
the other.
The choice of what is the most appropriate type of 
graph or chart to use in graphically displaying a data 
set depends on many criteria, and many of these crite-
ria are not quantifiable: Who is your audience? Do you 
have a message? Are you trying sell a product or idea? 
Are you looking for particular patterns? To keep things 
simple, we will focus on two basic but critical questions:  
(1) How large is the data set? and (2) Does the data 
represent a discrete or a continuous variable?
n  Discrete variable. A discrete variable is one in which the values of the variable 
can only change by minimum increments. In other words, two different values 
of the variable cannot be arbitrarily close to each other—there is a minimum 
gap required.
A classic example of a discrete variable is a test score. If the test is multiple- 
choice then it is obvious—the minimum gap between two scores is one point (as-
suming each question is worth a point). Even when the scoring is more refined, 
such as in an essay, there is a minimum gap between scores—half a point, a quarter 
of a point, a tenth of a point. There is always a limit as to how far the person doing 
the scoring can go in finessing the differences between essays.
n  Continuous variables. Continuous variables are variables that can take infinitely 
many values, and those values can differ by arbitrarily small amounts.
A good example of a continuous variable is the measured distance between 
two points. In theory, two different distance measurements could differ by an 
inch, a tenth of an inch, or one-millionth of an inch—there is no minimum

gap that must separate the two. (In practice, of course, there is the problem 
of how refined can our measurement be—if the difference between the two 
distances is one-millionth of an inch we probably won’t be able to measure the 
 difference.)
The case of money (especially when we are dealing with large sums) is particularly  
interesting because money is really a discrete variable (the minimum gap between 
two sums of money is one cent), but it is usually described as if it were a continuous 
variable. In other words, when two large sums of money differ by a penny we will 
think of that difference as being “infinitely small.”
Bar Graphs, Pictograms, and Line Graphs
We will start our exploration of data sets and their graphical representations with a 
fictitious example. Except for the details, this example represents a situation famil-
iar to every college student.

Stat 101 miDtErm SCorES
As usual, the day after the midterm exam in his Stat 101 class, Dr. Blackbeard has 
posted the scores online (Table 1). The data set consists of N = 75 data points (the 
number of students who took the test). Each data point (listed under the “Score” 
columns) is an integer between 0 and 25 (Dr. Blackbeard gives no partial credit). 
Note that the numbers listed under the “ID” columns are not data points—they are 
the last four digits of the student IDs used as substitutes for their names to protect 
the students’ rights of privacy.

Graphs, Charts, and Numbers
Figures 1(a) and (b) are both examples of a type of graph called a bar graph. 
Figure 1(a) is the fancier, 3D version; Fig. 1(b) is a more plain 2D version, but they 
both illustrate the data set equally well. When looking at either one, one of the 
first things we would notice are the two outliers (i.e., data points that do not fit-in 
with the rest of the data). In the Stat 101 data set there are two obvious outliers— 
the score of 24 (head and shoulders above the rest of the class) and the score of 1 
(lagging way behind the pack).

Like students everywhere, the students in the Stat 101 class have one question 
foremost on their mind when they look at Table 1: How did I do? Each student can 
answer this question directly from the table. It’s the next question that is statistically 
much more interesting. How did the class as a whole do?
The first step in organizing the data set in Table 1 is to create a frequency table 
such as Table 2. In this table, the number below each score gives the frequency of the 
score—that is, the number of students getting that particular score. We can readily 
see from Table 2 that there was one student with a score of 1, one with a score of 6, 
two with a score of 7, six with a score of 8, and so on. Notice that the scores with a 
frequency of zero are not listed in the table.
Table 2 shows that the N = 75 scores fall into M = 13 different actual values (1, 
6, 7, . . . , 15, 16, 24). If we think of the actual values as “bins” where we can place the 
data, we get a graph such as the one shown in Fig. 1(a). A slightly simpler version of 
the same idea is shown in Fig. 1(b).

Graphs, Charts, and Numbers
Sometimes it is useful to draw a bar graph using relative frequencies—that is, 
making the heights of the bars represent percentages of the population. Figure 2 
shows a relative frequency bar graph for the Stat 101 data set. Notice that we indi-
cated on the graph that we are dealing with percentages rather than absolute fre-
quencies and that the size of the data set is N = 75. This allows anyone who wishes 
to do so to compute the actual frequencies. For example, Fig. 2 indicates that 12% 
of the 75 students scored a 12 on the exam, so the actual frequency is given by 
75 * 0.12 = 9 students. The change from actual frequencies to percentages (or vice 
versa) does not change the shape of the graph—it is basically a change of scale.

FiGurE 2 Relative frequency bar graph for the Stat 101 data set.
Relative frequency bar graphs are especially convenient when we have a very 
large data set (N is in the thousands or more) but a relatively small number of actual 
values. In these cases the frequencies for each bar tend to be very large and it is 
much easier to handle things using percentages.
While the term bar graph is most commonly used for graphs like the ones in 
Figs. 1 and 2, there is no rule that mandates that the columns have to take the form 
of bars. Sometimes the “bins” can be filled with symbolic images that can add a lit-
tle extra flair or subtly influence the content of the information given by the graph. 
Dr. Blackbeard, for example, might have chosen to display the midterm data using 
a graph like the one shown in Fig. 3, which conveys the same information as the 
original bar graph and includes a subtle individual message to each student.

FiGurE 3 Pictogram for the Stat 101 data set.

Graphs, Charts, and Numbers
Frequency charts that use icons or symbolic images instead of bars to display 
the frequencies are commonly referred to as pictograms. The point of a pictogram is 
that a graph is often used not only to inform but also to impress and persuade, and, 
in such cases, a well-chosen icon or image can be a more effective tool than just a bar.

Figure 4(a) is a pictogram showing the growth in yearly sales of the XYZ Corpora-

actly the same data with a much more accurate picture of how well the XYZ Corpo-
ration had been doing.

The difference between the two pictograms can be attributed to a couple of stan-
dard tricks of the trade: (1) stretching the scale of the vertical axis and (2) “cheating” 
on the choice of starting value on the vertical axis. As an educated consumer, you 
should always be on the lookout for these tricks. In graphical descriptions of data, a 
fine line separates objectivity from propaganda. (For more on this topic, see Project 1.)
For convenience let’s call the number of bars in a bar graph M. In a typical bar 
graph M is a number in single or double digits, and rarely will you see a bar graph 
with M 7 100. Even if you push the columns together and make them really skinny 
you can only fit so many in a reasonably sized window. Figure 5 shows a bar graph 
with M = 80, and that is already pushing the upper limit of what a reasonably sized 
bar graph can accommodate.

An alternative to a bar graph that eliminates the need for bars is a line graph. 
In a line graph, instead of bars we use points (small circles or small squares) with

adjacent points connected by lines [Fig. 6(a)]. Line graphs are particularly useful 
when the number of values plotted is large [Fig. 6(b)], or when the graph represents 
a time-series (i.e., the horizontal axis represents a time variable) such as when track-
ing the price of a company’s stock in a stock market [Fig. 6(c)].

This graph illustrates how a good graphical display can pack a lot of useful in-
formation. First, there are a lot of data being displayed—53 different data points for 
each manufacturer, 159 data points in all, and yet, the graph does not appear crowded. 
This would be much harder to accomplish using bar graphs. Secondly, there is a lot 
of useful information lurking behind the visible patterns in the data—we can see the 
big drop in sales for all three automakers at the end of 2008 (the aftermath of the Big 
Recession of 2008), we can see the sales spiking every December (Christmas bonuses, 
dealers trying to meet their annual quotas), we can see the 2012 sales climbing back 
to 2008 levels, and so on. When properly done, a statistical graph can be a great ex-
ploratory tool—all you have to do is look at it carefully and ask the right questions.
Categorical Variables and Pie Charts
A variable need not always represent a measurable quantity—variables can also 
describe non-numerical characteristics of a population such as gender, ethnicity, na-
tionality, emotions, feelings, actions, etc. Variables of this type are called categorical 
(or qualitative) variables.

In some ways, categorical variables must be treated differently from numeri-
cal variables—you can’t add, rescale, or average categories—but when it comes to 
graphical displays of data, categorical variables can be treated much like discrete 
numerical variables.

Table 3 shows a breakdown of how a typical full-time university 
or college student spends a typical nonholiday weekday. Time 
use is broken into eight major categories, including the catch-all 
category “Other.” (Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, American 
Time Use Survey. Data include individuals, ages 15 to 49, who 
were enrolled full time at a university or college. Data include 
nonholiday weekdays and are averages for 2006–2010.)
Figure 8(a) is a bar graph for the data in Table 3. The only dif-
ference between this bar graph and the others we saw earlier is the 
absence of a horizontal axis. Since the data is categorical, there is 
no number line or time line for the placement of the columns. In 
fact, other than making sure that the bottoms of the columns are 
aligned, you can position the columns any way you want.
Figure 8(b) is a pie chart representing the data in Table 3. In a 
pie chart, the categories take the form of wedges of pie (or slices 
of pizza, if you prefer), with the size of each wedge (measured 
by the central angle of the wedge) proportional to the frequency 
of that category. To calculate the central angle for a category (in 
degrees) we first convert the frequency of that category into a 
relative frequency (i.e., a percentage) and then use the fact that 1, = 3.6 (which 
follows from 100, = 360).
Here is the computation of the central angle corresponding to the category 
“Sleep” (8.4 hours): First, 8.4>24 = 0.35 = 35%; then, 35 * 3.6 = 126. [These two 
steps can be nicely combined into a single calculation: 18.4>242 * 360 = 126. This 
works because converting the 0.35 to 35% and multiplying by 3.6 is the same as  
leaving the 0.35 alone and multiplying by 360.]

In general, the computation of the central angle for a category doesn’t always 
work out as nicely as it did for the Sleep category, and typically you end up with 
fractions of a degree. You can decide how accurate you want to be in your central 
angle measurements, but rounding the number to the nearest degree is typically 
more than good enough. Table 4 shows the calculations for the central angles of all 
eight categories in Table 3.

Sometimes a variable starts out as a numerical variable, but then, as a matter of 
convenience, it is converted into a categorical variable. You are certainly familiar 
with one of the classic examples of this—your numerical scores (in an exam, or in a 
course) converted into categories (grades A, B, C, D, or F) according to some arti-
ficial scale [e.g., A = 909100, B = 80989, C = 70979, D = 60969, F = 0959 or some 
variation thereof. (Have you ever wondered why it’s not A = 809100, B = 60979, 
C = 40959, D = 20939, F = 0919?)].

Stat 101 miDtErm GraDES
We are going to take a second look at the midterm scores in Prof. Blackbeard’s Stat 
101 section (Example 1). The midterm score is a numerical variable that can take 
integer values between 0 and 25. Prof. Blackbeard’s grading scale is A = 18925, 
B = 14917, C = 11913, D = 9910, and F = 098. (This is a somewhat unusual way to 
scale for grades, but Prof. Blackbeard is a pretty unusual guy and has his own ideas 
about how to do things.)
Table 5 is the categorical (grade) version of the original nu-
merical (score) frequency table (Table 2). One A and 36 D’s and 
F’s. What’s up with that?
Figure 9(a) is a bar graph for the data in Table 5.  Figure 9(b) 
is the corresponding pie chart. In the pie chart, each stu-
dent represents an angle of 
360
75 = 4.8. Rounding the central an-
gles to the nearest degree gives angles of 5 for A, 38 for B, 144 for C, 125 for D, 
and 48 for F. In both cases, the small size of the A category creates a bit of a scaling 
problem; but, other than that, both images do a good job of conveying the results.

Converting numerical data into categorical data is particularly useful in situations 
involving large populations and large numbers of possible values for the measurements 
of the population. Our next example illustrates an important application of this idea.

Sat math SCorES (2011)
The college dreams and aspirations of millions of high school seniors often ride on 
their SAT scores. The SAT is divided into three subject areas (Math, Critical Read-
ing, and Writing), with separate scores in each subject area that range from a mini-
mum of 200 to a maximum of 800 points and going up in increments of 10 points. 
There is a total of 61 possible such scores (200, 210, 220, . . . , 790, 800) for each sub-
ject area—that’s a lot of possibilities. In this example, we will look at the 2011 Math 
scores only (see Exercises 15 and 16 for the Critical Reading and Writing scores).
A total of N = 1,647,123 college-bound seniors took the SAT in 2011. A full 
breakdown of the number of students by individual score would require a frequency 
table with 61 entries, or a bar graph with 61 columns, or a pie chart with 61 wedges. 
For most purposes, that’s a case of too much information! As an alternative, the 
results are broken into six score ranges called class intervals: 200–290, 300–390, . . . , 
600–690, and 700–800. (Think of these class intervals as analogous to letter grades 
except that there are no letters.) The first five class intervals contain 10 possible 
scores; the last class interval contains 11 possible scores.
The second column of Table 6 shows the aggregate results of the 2011 SAT 
Mathematics section. (Source: 2011 College Bound Seniors: Total Group Report. 
Copyright © 2011. The College Board. www.collegeboard.org. Reproduced with 
permission.) With numbers as large as these, it is somewhat easier to work with per-
centages of the population in each class interval (column 3). Figure 10(a) is a relative 
frequency bar graph for the data in column 3 of Table 6; Fig. 10(b) shows the cor-
responding pie chart.

Continuous Variables and histograms
When a numerical variable is continuous, its possible values can vary by infinitesi-
mally small increments. As a consequence, there are no gaps between the class 
intervals, and our old way of doing things (using separate columns for each actual 
value or category) will no longer work. In this case we use a variation of a bar 
graph called a histogram. We illustrate the concept of a histogram in the next 
example.
ExamPLE 7 
StartinG SaLariES oF tSu GraDuatES
Suppose we want to use a graph to display the distribution of starting salaries of the 
2012 graduating class at Tasmania State University (N = 3258).
The starting salaries range from a low of $40,350 to a high of $74,800. Based on 
this range and the amount of detail we want to show, we must decide on the length 
of the class intervals. A reasonable choice would be to use class intervals defined in 
increments of $5000. Table 7 is a frequency table for the salaries based on these class 
intervals. We chose a starting value of $40,000 for convenience. The third column in 
the table shows the data as a percentage of the population (rounded to the nearest 
percentage point).
The histogram showing the relative frequency of each class interval is shown in 
Fig. 11.

As we can see, a histogram is very similar to a bar graph. Several important 
distinctions must be made, however. To begin with, because a histogram is used for 
continuous variables, there can be no gaps between the class intervals, and it fol-
lows, therefore, that the columns of a histogram must touch each other. In addition, 
we must decide how to handle a value that falls exactly on the boundary between 
two class intervals. Should it always belong to the class interval to the left or to the 
one to the right? This is called the endpoint convention. The “plus” superscripts in 
Table 7 and Fig. 11 indicate how we chose to deal with the endpoint convention in 
Example 7. A starting salary of exactly $50,000, for example, would be listed under 
the 45,000+950,000 class interval rather than the 50,000+955,000 class interval.
When creating histograms, we should try, as much as possible, to define class 
intervals of equal size. When the class intervals are significantly different in size, 
the rules for creating a histogram are considerably more complicated, since it is no 
longer appropriate to use the heights of the columns to indicate the frequencies of 
the class intervals. (For more details on histograms with class intervals of unequal 
lengths, see Exercises 73 and 74.)

aVEraGE SCorE in thE Stat 101 miDtErm
In this example we will find the average test score in the Stat 101 exam first intro-
duced in Example 1. To find this average we need to add all the test scores and 
divide by 75. The addition of the 75 test scores can be simplified considerably if we 
use a frequency table. (Table 8 is the same as Table 2, shown again for the reader’s 
convenience.)
As useful as bar graphs, pie charts, and histograms can be in describing data, in 
some circumstances (for example, in everyday conversation) a graph is not readily 
available and we have to resort to other means of description. One of the most con-
venient and commonly used devices is to use numerical summaries of the data. In 
this section we will discuss a few of the more frequently used numerical summaries 
for a data set.
the average
The most commonly used number for summarizing a data set is the average, also 
called the mean. (There is no universal agreement as to which of these names is a 
better choice—in some settings mean is a better choice than average, in other set-
tings it’s the other way around. In this chapter we will use whichever seems the bet-
ter choice at the moment.)
n average (mean). The average A of a set of N numbers is found by adding the 
numbers and dividing the total by N. In other words, the average of the data set 
d1, d2, d3, . . . , dN, is A = 1d1 + d2 + g+ dN2>N.

From the frequency table we can find the sum S of all the test scores as follows: 
Multiply each test score by its corresponding frequency, and then add these prod-
ucts. Thus, the sum of all the test scores is
S = 11 * 12 + 16 * 12 + 17 * 22 + 18 * 62 + g + 116 * 12 + 124 * 12 = 814
If we divide this sum by N = 75, we get the average test score A (rounded to two 
decimal places): A = 814>75  10.85 points.
In general, to find the average A of a data set given by a frequency table such as 
Table 9 we do the following:
n Step 1. S = d1
 f1 + d2 f2 + g+ dk fk.
n Step 2. N = f1 + f2 + g+ fk.
n Step 3. A = S>N.

StartinG SaLariES oF PhiLoSoPhY majorS
Imagine that you just read in the paper the following remarkable tidbit: The average 
starting salary of 2011 Tasmania State University graduates with a philosophy major 
was $76,400 a year! This is quite an impressive number, but before we all rush out 
to change majors, let’s point out that one of those philosophy majors happened to 
be basketball star “Hoops” Tallman, who is now doing his thing in the NBA for a 
starting salary of $3.5 million a year.
If we were to take this one outlier out of the population of 75 philosophy majors, 
we would have a more realistic picture of what philosophy majors are making. Here 
is how we can do it:
n The total of all 75 salaries is 75 times the average salary: 
75 * +76,400 = $5,730,000
n The total of the other 74 salaries (excluding Hoops’s cool 3.5 mill): 
+5,730,000 - $3,500,000 = $2,230,000
n The average of the remaining 74 salaries: +2,230,000>74  +30,135
Percentiles
While a single numerical summary—such as the average—can be useful, it is rarely 
sufficient to give a meaningful description of a data set. A better picture of the data 
set can be presented by using a well-organized cadre of numerical summaries. The 
most common way to do this is by means of percentiles.
n Percentiles. The pth percentile of a data set is a number Xp such that p% of 
the data is smaller or equal to Xp and 1100 - p2% of the data is bigger or equal 
to Xp.
Many college students are familiar with percentiles, if for no other reason than 
the way they pop up in SAT reports. In all SAT reports, a given score—say a score 
of 620 in the Mathematics section—is identified with a percentile—say the 81st per-
centile. This can be interpreted to mean that 81% of those taking the test scored 620 
or less, or, looking up instead of down, that 19% of those taking the test scored 620 
or more.
There are several different ways to compute percentiles that will satisfy the defi-
nition, and different statistics books describe different methods. We will illustrate 
one such method below.
The first step in finding the pth percentile of a data set of N numbers is to 
sort the numbers from smallest to largest. Let’s denote the sorted data values by 
d1, d2, d3, . . . , dN, where d1 represents the smallest number in the data set, d2 the 
second smallest number, and so on. Sometimes we will also need to talk about the 
average of two consecutive numbers in the sorted list, so we will use more unusual 
subscripts such as d3.5 to represent the average of the data values d3 and d4, d7.5 to 
represent the average of the data values d7 and d8, and so on.
The next, and most important, step is to identify which d represents the pth per-
centile of the data set. To do this, we compute the pth percent of N, which we will call 
the locator and denote it by the letter L. [In other words, L = 1
p
1002N.] If L happens to 
be a whole number, then the pth percentile will be dL.5 (the average of dL and dL+1). 
If L is not a whole number, then the pth percentile will be dL+ , where L+ represents 
the value of L rounded up.
When dealing with data sets that have outliers, averages can be quite mislead-
ing. As our next example illustrates, even a single outlier can have a big effect on 
the average.

To reward good academic performance from its athletes, Tasmania State University has 
a program in which athletes with GPAs in the 80th or higher percentile of their team’s 
GPAs get a $5000 scholarship and athletes with GPAs in the 55th or higher percentile 
of their team’s GPAs who did not get the $5000 scholarship get a $2000 scholarship.
The women’s volleyball team has N = 15 players on the roster. A list of their 
GPAs is as follows:
3.42, 3.91, 3.33, 3.65, 3.57, 3.45, 4.0, 3.71, 3.35, 3.82, 3.67, 3.88, 3.76, 3.41, 3.62
The sorted list of GPAs (from smallest to largest) is:
3.33, 3.35, 3.41, 3.42, 3.45, 3.57, 3.62, 3.65, 3.67, 3.71, 3.76, 3.82, 3.88, 3.91, 4.0
n $5000 scholarships: The locator for the 80th percentile is 10.82 * 15 = 12. Here 
the locator is a whole number, so the 80th percentile is given by d12.5 = 3.85 (the 
average between d12 = 3.82 and d13 = 3.88). Thus, three students (the ones with 
GPAs of 3.88, 3.91, and 4.0) get $5000 scholarships.
n $2000 scholarships: The locator for the 55th percentile is 10.552 * 15 = 8.25. 
This locator is not a whole number, so we round it up to 9, and the 55th per-
centile is given by d9 = 3.67. Thus, the students with GPAs of 3.67, 3.71, 3.76, 
and 3.82 (all students with GPAs of 3.67 or higher except the ones that already 
received $5000 scholarships) get $2000 scholarships.
the median and the Quartiles
The 50th percentile of a data set is known as the median and denoted by M. The 
median splits a data set into two halves—half of the data is smaller or equal to the 
median and half of the data is bigger or equal to the median.
We can find the median by simply applying the definition of percentile with 
p = 50, but the bottom line comes down to this: (1) when N is odd, the median is 
the data point in position 1N + 12>2 of the sorted data set; (2) when N is even, 
the median is the average of the data points in positions N>2 and N>2 + 1 of 
the sorted data set. [All of the preceding follows from the fact that the locator 
for the median is L =
N
2. When N is even, L is an integer; when N is odd, L is 
not an integer.]
The procedure for finding the pth percentile of a data set is summarized as 
follows:

After the median, the next most commonly used set of percentiles are the quartiles. 
The first quartile (denoted by Q1) is the 25th percentile, and the third quartile (de-
noted by Q3) is the 75th percentile of the data set.

homE PriCES in GrEEn hiLLS
During the last year, 11 homes sold in the Green Hills subdivision. The selling 
prices, in chronological order, were $267,000, $252,000, $228,000, $234,000, $292,000, 
$263,000, $221,000, $245,000, $270,000, $238,000, and $255,000. We are going to find 
the median and the quartiles of the N = 11 home prices.
Sorting the home prices from smallest to largest (and dropping the 000’s) gives 
the sorted list
221, 228, 234, 238, 245, 252, 255, 263, 267, 270, 292
The locator for the median is 10.52 * 11 = 5.5, the locator for the first quartile is 
10.252 * 11 = 2.75, and the locator for the third quartile is 10.752 * 11 = 8.25. Since 
these locators are not whole numbers, they must be rounded up: 5.5 to 6, 2.75 to 3, 
and 8.25 to 9. Thus, the median home price is given by d6 = 252 (i.e., M = +252,000), 
the first quartile is given by d3 = 234 (i.e., Q1 = +234,000), and the third quartile is 
given by d9 = 267 (i.e., Q3 = +267,000).
Oops! Just this morning a home sold in Green Hills for $264,000. We need to 
recalculate the median and quartiles for what are now N = 12 home prices.
We can use the sorted data set that we already had—all we have to do is insert 
the new home price (264) in the right spot (remember, we drop the 000’s!). This gives
221, 228, 234, 238, 245, 252, 255, 263, 264, 267, 270, 292
Now N = 12 and in this case the median is the average of d6 = 252 and d7 = 255. 
It follows that the median home price is M = +253,500. The locator for the first quar-
tile is 0.25 * 12 = 3. Since the locator is a whole number, the first quartile is the 
average of d3 = 234 and d4 = 238 (i.e., Q1 = +236,000). Similarly, the third quartile is 
Q3 = 265,500 (the average of d9 = 264 and d10 = 267).

Having the frequency table available eliminates the need for sorting the 
scores—the frequency table has, in fact, done this for us. Here N = 75 (odd), so the 
median is the thirty-eighth score (counting from the left) in the frequency table. 
To find the thirty-eighth number in Table 10, we tally frequencies as we move from 
511

Graphs, Charts, and Numbers
left to right: 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 1 + 2 = 4; 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 = 10; 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 10 = 20; 
1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 10 + 16 = 36. At this point, we know that the 36th test score on the 
list is a 10 (the last of the 10’s) and the next 13 scores are all 11’s. We can conclude 
that the 38th test score is 11. Thus, M = 11.
The locator for the first quartile is L = 10.252 * 75 = 18.75. Thus, Q1 = d19. To 
find the nineteenth score in the frequency table, we tally frequencies from left to 
right: 1 + 1 = 2; 1 + 1 + 2 = 4; 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 = 10; 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 10 = 20. At this 
point we realize that d10 = 8 (the last of the 8’s) and that d11 through d20 all equal 9. 
Hence, the first quartile of the Stat 101 midterm scores is Q1 = d19 = 9.
Since the first and third quartiles are at an equal “distance” from the two ends of 
the sorted data set, a quick way to locate the third quartile now is to look for the nine-
teenth score in the frequency table when we count frequencies from right to left. We 
leave it to the reader to verify that the third quartile of the Stat 101 data set is Q3 = 12.

FiVE-numBEr SummarY For thE Stat 101 miDtErm
For the Stat 101 data set, the five-number summary is Min = 1, Q1 = 9, M = 11, 
Q3 = 12, Max = 24 (see Example 12). What useful information can we get out of 
this?
Right away we can see that the N = 75 test scores were not evenly spread out over 
the range of possible scores. For example, from M = 11 and Q3 = 12 we can conclude 
that 25% or more of the class (that means at least 19 students) scored either 11 or 12 
ExamPLE 13 
mEDian anD QuartiLES For 2011 Sat math SCorES
In this example we continue the discussion of the 2011 SAT Math scores introduced 
in Example 6. Recall that the number of college-bound students taking the test was 
N = 1,647,123. As reported by the College Board, the median score in the test was 
M = 510, the first quartile score was Q1 = 430, and the third quartile was Q3 = 600. 
What can we make of this information?
Let’s start with the median. From N = 1,647,123 (an odd number), we can con-
clude that the median (510 points) is the 823,562nd score in the sorted list of test 
scores. This means that there were at least 823,562 students who scored 510 or less 
in the math section of the 2011 SAT. Why did we use “at least” in the preceding sen-
tence? Could there have been more than that number who scored 510 or less? Yes, 
almost surely. Since the number of students who scored 510 is in the thousands, it is 
very unlikely that the 823,562nd score will be the last of the group of 510s.
In a similar vein, we can conclude that there were at least 411,781 scores of 
Q1 = 430 or less [the locator for the first quartile is 10.252 * 1,647,123 = 411,780.75] 
and at least 1,235,343 scores of Q3 = 600 or less.
A note of warning: Medians, quartiles, and general percentiles are often comput-
ed using statistical calculators or statistical software packages, which is all well and 
fine since the whole process can be a bit tedious. The problem is that there is no 
universally agreed upon procedure for computing percentiles, so different types of 
calculators and different statistical packages may give different answers from each 
other and from those given in this text for quartiles and other percentiles (every-
one agrees on the median). Keep this in mind when doing the exercises—the answer 
given by your calculator may be slightly different from the one you would get from 
the procedure we use in the text.
the Five-number Summary
A common way to summarize a large data set is by means of its five-number sum-
mary. The five-number summary is given by (1) the smallest value in the data set 
(called the Min), (2) the first quartile Q1, (3) the median M, (4) the third quartile Q3, 
and (5) the largest value in the data set (called the Max). These five numbers to-
gether often tell us a great deal about the data.

on the test. At the same time, from Q3 = 12 and Max = 24 we can conclude that at 
most 18 students had scores in the 13–24 point range. Using similar arguments, we can 
conclude that at least 19 students had scores between Q1 = 9 and M = 11 points and 
at most 18 students scored in the 1–8 point range.
The “big picture” we get from the five-number summary of the Stat 101 test 
scores is that there was a lot of bunching up in a narrow band of scores (at least half 
of the students in the class scored in the range 9–12 points), and the rest of the class 
was all over the place. In general, this type of “lumpy” distribution of test scores is 
indicative of a test with an uneven level of difficulty—a bunch of easy questions and 
a bunch of really hard questions with little in between. (Having seen the data, we 
know that the Min and Max scores were both outliers and that if we disregard these 
two outliers, the test results don’t look quite so bad. Of course, there is no way to 
pick this up from just the five-number summary.)
Box Plots
Invented in 1977 by statistician John Tukey, a box plot (also known as a box-and-
whisker plot) is a picture of the five-number summary of a data set. The box plot 
consists of a rectangular box that sits above a number line representing the data 
values and extends from the first quartile Q1 to the third quartile Q3 on that number 
line. A vertical line crosses the box, indicating the position of the median M. On 
both sides of the box are “whiskers” extending to the smallest value, Min, and larg-
est value, Max, of the data. Figure 12 shows a generic box plot for a data set.
Figure 13(a) shows a box plot for the Stat 101 data set 
(see Example 12). The long whiskers in this box plot are 
largely due to the outliers 1 and 24. Figure 13(b) shows 
a variation of the same box plot, but with the two outli-
ers, marked with two crosses, segregated from the rest of 
the data. (When there are outliers, it is useful to segregate 
them from the rest of the data set—we think of outliers as 
“anomalies” within the data set.)

Figure 14 shows box plots for the starting salaries of two differ-
ent populations: first-year agriculture and engineering gradu-
ates of Tasmania State University.
Superimposing the two box plots on the same scale allows 
us to make some useful comparisons. It is clear, for instance, that 
engineering graduates are doing better overall than agriculture 
graduates, even though at the very top levels agriculture graduates 
are better paid. Another interesting point is that the median sal-
ary of agriculture graduates ($43,000) is less than the first quartile 
of the salaries of engineering graduates ($45,000). The very short 
whisker on the left side of the agriculture box plot tells us that

ranGE anD iQr For 2011 Sat math SCorES
The five-number summary for the 2011 SAT Math scores (see Example 13) was 
Min = 200 (yes, there were a few jokers who missed every question!), Q1 = 430, 
M = 510, Q3 = 600, Max = 800 (there are still a few geniuses around!). It follows 
that the 2011 SAT Math scores had a range of 600 points 1800 - 200 = 6002 and an 
IQR of 170 points 1IQR = 600 - 430 = 1702.
the Standard Deviation
The most important and most commonly used measure of spread for a data set is 
the standard deviation. The key concept for understanding the standard deviation is 
the concept of deviation from the mean. If A is the average of the data set and x is an 
arbitrary data value, the difference x - A is x’s deviation from the mean. The devia-
tions from the mean tell us how “far” the data values are from the average value of 
the data. The idea is to use this information to figure out how spread out the data is. 
There are, unfortunately, several steps before we can get there.
The deviations from the mean are themselves a data set, which we would like 
to summarize. One way would be to average them, but if we do that, the negative 
deviations and the positive deviations will always cancel each other out so that we 
end up with an average of 0. This, of course, makes the average useless in this case. 
The cancellation of positive and negative deviations can be avoided by squaring 
each of the deviations. The squared deviations are never negative, and if we average 
them out, we get an important measure of spread called the variance, denoted by 
V. Finally, we take the square root of the variance and get the standard deviation, 
denoted by the Greek letter s (and sometimes by the acronym SD).
The following is an outline of the definition of the standard deviation of a 
data set.
There are several different ways to describe the spread of a data set; in this section 
we will describe the three most commonly used ones.
n the range. The range R of a data set is given by the difference between the high-
est and lowest values of the data 1R = Max - Min2.
The range is most useful when there are no outliers in the data. In the presence 
of outliers the range tells a distorted story. For example, the range of the test scores 
in the Stat 101 exam (Example 1) is 24 - 1 = 23 points, an indication of a big spread 
within the scores (i.e., a very heterogeneous group of students). True enough, but if 
we discount the two outliers, the remaining 73 test scores would have a much smaller 
range of 16 - 6 = 10 points.
To eliminate the possible distortion caused by outliers, a common practice when 
measuring the spread of a data set is to use the interquartile range, denoted by the 
acronym IQR.
n the interquartile range. The interquartile range IQR is the difference between 
the third quartile and the first quartile 1IQR = Q3 - Q12. The IQR tells us how 
spread out the middle 50% of the data values are. For many types of real-world 
data, the IQR is a useful measure of spread.
Ranges and Standard Deviations

the bottom 25% of agriculture salaries are concentrated in a very narrow salary range 
($33,000–$35,000). We can also see that agriculture salaries are much more spread out 
than engineering salaries, even though most of the spread occurs at the higher end of the 
salary scale.

thE StanDarD DEViation oF a Data SEt
n Let A denote the mean of the data set. For each number x in the data set, com-
pute its deviation from the mean 1x - A2 and square each of these numbers. 
These numbers are called the squared deviations.
n Find the average of the squared deviations. This number is called the variance V.
n The standard deviation is the square root of the variance 1s = 2V2.
Standard deviations of large data sets are not fun to calculate by hand, and they 
are rarely found that way. The standard procedure for calculating standard devia-
tions is to use a computer or a good scientific or business calculator, often prepro-
grammed to do all the steps automatically. Be that as it may, it is still important to 
understand what’s behind the computation of a standard deviation, even when the 
actual grunt work is going to be performed by a machine.
ExamPLE 17 
CaLCuLation oF a SD
Over the course of the semester, Angela 
turned in all of her homework assignments. 
Her grades in the 10 assignments (sorted 
from lowest to highest) were 85, 86, 87, 88, 
89, 91, 92, 93, 94, and 95. Our goal in this ex-
ample is to calculate the standard deviation 
of this data set the old-fashioned way (i.e., 
doing our own grunt work).
The first step is to find the mean A of 
the data set. It’s not hard to see that A = 90. 
We are lucky—this is a nice round num-
ber! The second step is to calculate the de-
viations from the mean and then the squared 
deviations. The details are shown in the sec-
ond and third columns of Table 11. When 
we average the squared deviations, we get 
125 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 252>10
= 11. This means that the variance is V = 11 
and, thus, the standard deviation (rounded to
one decimal place) is s = 211  3.3 points.
Standard deviations are measured in the same units as the original data, so in 
Example 17 the standard deviation of Angela’s homework scores was roughly 3.3 
points. What should we make of this fact? It is clear from just a casual look at An-
gela’s homework scores that she was pretty consistent in her homework, never stray-
ing too much above or below her average score of 90 points. The standard deviation 
is, in effect, a way to measure this degree of consistency (or lack thereof). A small 
standard deviation tells us that the data are consistent and the spread of the data is 
small, as is the case with Angela’s homework scores.
The ultimate in consistency within a data set is when all the data values are the 
same (like Angela’s friend Chloe, who got a 20 in every homework assignment). 
When this happens the standard deviation is 0. On the other hand, when there is a 
lot of inconsistency within the data set, we are going to get a large standard devia-
tion. This is illustrated by Angela’s other friend, Tiki, whose homework scores were 
5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95. We would expect the standard deviation of this 
data set to be quite large—in fact, it is almost 29 points.
The standard deviation is arguably the most important and frequently used 
measure of data spread. Yet it is not a particularly intuitive concept. Here are a few 
basic guidelines that recap our preceding discussion:

n The standard deviation of a data set is measured in the same units as the original 
data. For example, if the data are points on a test, then the standard deviation is also 
given in points. Conversely, if the standard deviation is given in dollars, then we can 
conclude that the original data must have been money—home prices, salaries, or 
something like that. For sure, the data couldn’t have been test scores on an exam.
n It is pointless to compare standard deviations of data sets that are given in dif-
ferent units. Even for data sets that are given in the same units—say, for ex-
ample, test scores—the underlying scale should be the same. We should not try 
to compare standard deviations for SAT scores measured on a scale of 200–800 
points with standard deviations of a set of homework assignments measured on 
a scale of 0–100 points.
n For data sets that are based on the same underlying scale, a comparison of stan-
dard deviations can tell us something about the spread of the data. If the stan-
dard deviation is small, we can conclude that the data points are all bunched 
together—there is very little spread. As the standard deviation increases, we 
can conclude that the data points are beginning to spread out. The more spread 
out they are, the larger the standard deviation becomes. A standard deviation 
of 0 means that all data values are the same.
As a measure of spread, the standard deviation is particularly useful for analyz-
ing real-life data. 
Graphical summaries of data can be produced by bar graphs, pictograms, pie charts, 
histograms, and so on. (There are many other types of graphical descriptions that we 
did not discuss in the chapter.) The kind of graph that is the most appropriate for a 
situation depends on many factors, and creating a good “picture” of a data set is as 
much an art as a science.
Numerical summaries of data, when properly used, help 
us understand the overall pattern of a data set without getting  
bogged down in the details. They fall into two categories:  
(1) measures of location, such as the average, the median, and the 
quartiles, and (2) measures of spread, such as the range, the in-
terquartile range, and the standard deviation. Sometimes we even 
combine numerical summaries and graphical displays, as in the 
case of the box plot. We touched upon all of these in this chapter, 
but the subject is a big one, and by necessity we only scratched the surface.
Conclusion
Statistical reasoning will one day be 
as necessary for efficient citizenship 
as the ability to read and write.
“
– H. G. Wells
”
In this day and age, we are all consumers of data, and at one time or another, we 
are likely to be providers of data as well. Thus, understanding the basics of how data 
are organized and summarized has become an essential requirement for personal 
success and good citizenship.

Exercises 59 and 60 refer to the mode of a data set. The mode of 
a data set is the data point that occurs with the highest frequency. 
When there are several data points (or categories) tied for the most 
frequent, each of them is a mode, but if all data points have the 
same frequency, rather than say that every data point is a mode, it 
is customary to say that there is no mode.
 59. (a)  Find the mode of the data set given by Table 20 
(Exercise 30).
 
(b) Find the mode of the data set given by Fig. 15

 50. This exercise refers to the starting salaries of Tasmania 
State University first-year graduates in agriculture and en-
gineering discussed in Exercises 45 and 46.
 
(a) Estimate the range for the starting salaries of agricul-
ture majors.
 
(b) Estimate the interquartile range for the starting sala-
ries of engineering majors.
For Exercises 51 through 54, you should use the follow-
ing definition of an outlier: An outlier is any data value that 
is above the third quartile by more than 1.5 times the IQR 
[Outlier 7 Q3 + 1.5(IQR)] or below the first quartile by more 
than 1.5 times the IQR [Outlier 6 Q1 - 1.5(IQR)]. (Note: There 
is no one universally agreed upon definition of an outlier; this is 
but one of several definitions used by statisticians.)
 51. Suppose that the preceding definition of outlier is applied 
to the Stat 101 data set discussed in Example 14.
 
(a) Fill in the blank: Any score bigger than ___ is an  
outlier.
 
(b) Fill in the blank: Any score smaller than ___ is an 
outlier.
 
(c) Find the outliers (if there are any) in the Stat 101 data set.
 52. Using the preceding definition, find the outliers (if there 
are any) in the City of Cleansburg Fire Department data 
set discussed in Exercises 30 and 37. (Hint: Do Exercise 37 
first.)
 53. The distribution of the heights (in inches) of 18-year-old 
U.S. males has first quartile Q1 = 67 in. and third quar-
tile Q3 = 71 in. Using the preceding definition, determine 
which heights correspond to outliers.
 54. The distribution of the heights (in inches) of 18-year-old 
U.S. females has first quartile Q1 = 62.5 in. and third quar-
tile Q3 = 66 in. Using the preceding definition, determine 
which heights correspond to outliers.
The purpose of Exercises 55 through 58 is to practice computing 
standard deviations by using the definition. Granted, computing 
standard deviations this way is not the way it is generally done in 
practice; a good calculator (or a computer package) will do it much 
faster and more accurately. The point is that computing a few stan-
dard deviations the old-fashioned way should help you understand 
the concept a little better. If you use a calculator or a computer to 
answer these exercises, you are defeating their purpose.

(b) the same standard deviation.
Exercises 73 and 74 refer to histograms with unequal class in-
tervals. When sketching such histograms, the columns must be 
drawn so that the frequencies or percentages are proportional to 
the area of the column. Figure 21 illustrates this. If the column 
over class interval 1 represents 10% of the population, then the 
column over class interval 2, also representing 10% of the popula-
tion, must be one-third as high, because the class interval is three 
times as large (Fig. 21).

 80. Chebyshev’s theorem. The Russian mathematician P. 
L. Chebyshev (1821–1894) showed that for any data set 
and any constant k greater than 1, at least 1 - 11>k22 of 
the data must lie within k standard deviations on either 
side of the mean A. For example, when k = 2, this says 
 
 that 1 - 1
4 = 3
4 (i.e., 75%) of the data must lie within two 
 
 standard deviations of A (i.e., somewhere between A - 2s 
and A + 2s).

 76. Show that the standard deviation of any set of numbers is 
always less than or equal to the range of the set of numbers.
 77. (a)  Show that if 5x1, x2, x3, . . . , xN6 is a data set with mean 
A and standard deviation s, then s1N Ú xi - A  for 
every data value xi.
 
(b) Use (a) to show that every data value is bigger 
than or equal to A - s1N and smaller than or 
equal to A + s1N (i.e., for every data value x, 
A - s1N … x … A + s1N).

Graphs, Charts, and Numbers
 1 Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics
Statistics are often used to exaggerate, distort, and misinform, 
and this is most commonly done by the misuse of graphs and 
charts. In this project you are to discuss the different graphical 
“tricks” that can be used to mislead or slant the information pre-
sented in a picture. Attempt to include items from recent news-
papers, magazines, and other media.
 2 Data in Your Daily Life
Which month is the best one to invest in the stock market? Dur-
ing which day of the week are you most likely to get into an 
automobile accident? Which airline is the safest to travel with? 
Who is the best place-kicker in the National Football League?
In this project, you are to formulate a question from every-
day life (similar to one of the aforementioned questions) that 
is amenable to a statistical analysis. Then you will need to find  
relevant data that attempt to answer this question and summa-
rize these data using the methods discussed in this chapter. Pres-
ent your final conclusions and defend them using appropriate 
charts and graphs.
 3 Book review: Curve Ball
Baseball is the ultimate statistical sport, and statistics are 
as much a part of baseball as peanuts and Cracker Jack. The 
book Curve Ball: Baseball, Statistics, and the Role of Chance in 
the Game (Albert, Jim, and Jay Bennett, New York: Springer-
Verlag, 2001) is a compilation of all sorts of fascinating sta-
tistical baseball issues, from how to better measure a player’s 
offensive performance to what is the true value of home field 
advantage.
In this project you are to pick one of the many topics dis-
cussed in Curve Ball and write an analysis paper on the topic.

63. Somewhere between 823,562 and 894,894 students scored between 
200 and 480. (Since the median was 480, we know that at least half of 
the test-takers scored 480 or less. That gives a minimum of 823,562 
students scoring between 200 and 480. From Table 14 if we add the 
frequencies for 200–490 we get that 894,894 students scored be-
tween 200 and 490. This gives us a rough estimate for the maximum 
number of students that scored between 200 and 480.
